Trump has been elected president of the United States. The commander in chief, the most powerful man on earth, the supposed leader of the free world is now a man who holds liberal democracy in contempt. It's difficult to say what the next years will bring. For all his venom, Trump is no ideologue. He has not worked out a plan for how to subvert American democracy or destroy liberal institutions, if only because he has not much of a plan at all. So there is an outside chance that he will prove to be a surprisingly conventional--or simply a historically ineffective--president. But that seems unlikely. In my recent work, I have shown that citizens have increasingly turned against liberal democracy, especially in the United States. The traditional checks and balances that are supposed to safeguard our rights are at best imperfect bulwarks against a president determined to amass power. In many countries around the world, the consequences are already visible: Illiberal democracy, a system in which the people rule but the rights of unpopular minorities are routinely violated, is on the march. And if one thing is clear about Trump, it is that his instincts are deeply authoritarian. The political scientist Juan Linz listed the warning signs long ago. As described by the Harvard political scientists Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, they include ""a refusal to unambiguously disavow violence, a readiness to curtail rivals' civil liberties, and the denial of the legitimacy of an elected government."" Trump, they write, passes this anti-democratic litmus test with flying colors:"	How to Preserve the Ideals of Liberal Democracy in the Face of a Trump Presidency
1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/who_to_blame_for_trump_s_victory.html	"Near the end of this hellish summer, after the xenophobia and the racism (or at least some of it), and before the bragging about pussy-grabbing and the alleged assaults (or at least the reporting on them), I attended a wedding in Maryland. A Pakistani friend of mine from a Sunni family in Lahore had come to the United States to study and work years ago, living first in Washington and then in New York City. She had met an Iranian American man from a Shia family, and they had fallen in love. The ceremony was largely Persian, with some Pakistani and American traditions added to the mix. We sat in a large tent and ate and drank and danced. I was placed at a table with a number of their other friends, a high percentage of whom were Jewish. So was the officiant. As Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros blasted from the sound system, it occurred to me that our country was simply better than Donald Trump and all he embodied. The wedding itself, or my brief sketch of it, may seem cornily ""multicultural"" to some, but perhaps it takes an event like the one that occurred Tuesday night to make us remember how valuable such things are and how much fighting had to take place for them to be possible in the first place. When I think back to the wedding now, I can't help but remember the bride's father, who gave one of the most loving toasts I have ever heard and who now might not be allowed back into the country to visit his daughter. Perhaps sadness is an insufficient emotion after such a disastrous evening for America and our democracy. Rage works too. I can feel it boiling up inside me: for everyone from Trump; to the Republican politicians who allowed this to happen; to Jill Stein; to Jeff Zucker; to, finally, the voters who have made Trump our next president. Amid an endless stream of articles about their plight--too many of which I wrote myself--the simple fact remains that they chose this white nationalist candidate through their own free will, despite his complete inability to deliver them from their predicament. Into what further predicaments he will now deliver them, and everyone else, we can now only speculate and shudder. And then there is Hillary Clinton. It's fitting that the Clintons' permanent dance on the line between outright corruption and simple bad judgment ended up foreclosing any chance that Hillary Clinton had to be president. The email issue was wildly overblown by the media, but there is something almost Shakespearean about the Clintons as the authors of their own demise. The American people's distrust of Clinton was the result of many factors, including her gender. But it was also a consequence of decision after decision that she made. It is infuriating to think that her bad judgment helped elect Trump. Tell someone you are angry, and he or she will often say, What's the point? How does that help? That's fair, as far as it goes. The task now is to resist Trump in whatever form one can, whether through electoral politics, investigative journalism, or (say) working to make better the lives of the depressingly few Syrian refugees who managed to settle here over the past several years. But I also believe that a lack of anger--a lack of moral rage--is partially to blame for how we got here. Yes, the Trump supporters were plenty angry at the media, the Jews, the blacks, the immigrants, etc. But where was the anger directed toward this hateful candidate? Where was the anger at every last one of his supporters and enablers in the Republican Party? For a culture that so often appears tiresomely judgmental, the inability to make an instant, withering judgment about this monstrous man should be a mark of eternal shame. Perhaps this is too gloomy. Clinton essentially garnered as many if not more votes than Trump on Tuesday, and one can hope America's institutions will show more resistance to him than they did this past year. But at least at this moment, the election feels like something that won't be easily made right. On Tuesday night, when it became clear that the results were going Trump's way, my Pakistani friend texted me. ""I'm an immigrant, a woman, and a Muslim. Wtf am I supposed to think tonight?"" I don't have an answer. Right now, the memories from her wedding, and all it symbolized, don't feel like enough."	How Could We Have Let This Happen?

(You can read Silver's explanation of the different forecasts here.) The question is: Which gives the most accurate account of the chances that Donald Trump will become president of the United States? How should you, as a reader, choose between the three numbers Silver offers? Do you have a degree in statistics? Are you a professional forecaster or just an anxious American who wants to know if we're about to start building a wall on the Mexican border? How should we choose our forecasting criteria if Silver won't? Don't worry--Slate's got you covered. Presenting the Slate ~100 Percent Accurate Electoral Forecast Averagifier! What we've done to Silver and some of his peers is essentially what Silver did to the pollsters. We've taken his three forecasts and three others from similar electoral prognosticators and calculated what mathematicians call the ""average"" or sometimes the ""arithmetic mean."" (The details of how our server performs this calculation are too complex to go into here. Suffice it to say that averaging is a sophisticated econometric technique that combines addition and division. Silver himself uses it in his forecasts and in this tweet.) Want to know the actual, up-to-the-minute odds that Donald Trump will become leader of the free world? Then why not use all the available information--the ""now-cast,"" the ""polls-only"" forecast, the ""polls-plus"" forecast, the forecast generated by the New York Times' the Upshot, and more--combined into one superforecast by Slate's crack mathematical staff?

""I could really go for another Donald Trump audio leak right about now,"" Kate McKinnon's Hillary Clinton character says in a fake interview with CNN. The fictional Clinton then directly addresses The Apprentice creator and Trump collaborator Mark Burnett: ""Mark my baby, I know you're sitting on some pretty racist tapes of Donald on The Apprentice, so, Mark, as they say on Wheel of Fortune: 'Give me an N.' "" This was a reference to the very real rumor that Trump can be heard saying the N-word in unaired footage from The Apprentice. The rumor was floated not long after the leak of the Access Hollywood tape, and it seemed then like only a matter of time before someone released an Apprentice tape as well. But no leak ever came. What had happened? Was it simply that no video of the kind existed in the first place? Or were there no good Samaritans willing to step forward and assume the burden and potential legal liability of giving up the goods? Or perhaps, the most damaging material was merely in the hands of a Trump supporter? For the past few weeks, I've been making phone calls, sending emails, driving around every corner of Los Angeles, and traveling across state lines in an effort to answer those questions. I've attempted to reach dozens of former Apprentice staffers and have communicated with about 15 of them in mainly off-the-record conversations. What I've learned is a few minorly salacious, previously unreported anecdotes from a shoot at the Playboy Mansion--where among other things Trump supposedly averred that he wanted to ""drill"" various women on set--but no printable evidence of a majorly explosive tape. I've also found that if a more scandalous tape does indeed exist, it is unlikely ever to see the light of day. Trump was host of The Apprentice and later The Celebrity Apprentice for 14 seasons. The tapes with all those hours of archival footage have been locked away by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which owns Burnett's production company and its archive, and by Burnett himself. They claim there are legal reasons for keeping the footage hidden from public consumption, but lawyers have challenged that idea. Bill Pruitt, a producer from the first two seasons of The Apprentice caused a minor stir last month when he said publicly, that, yes, he knew that the really bad Apprentice tapes do exist. In a tweet sent shortly after the release of the Access Hollywood tapes, Pruitt said this: ""As a producer on seasons 1 & 2 of #theapprentice I assure you: when it comes to the #trumptapes there are far worse. #justthebegininng."" When I reached Pruitt by phone a few weeks ago, he insisted that the ""worse than Access Hollywood"" Apprentice tape is real. ""I certainly stand by what I wrote,"" he told me. ""I know there to be much, much worse comments made by Donald Trump during his years working on The Apprentice, the details of which I can't go into simply because they're under lock and key on tape and I can't be validated until those tapes come out."" Pruitt viewed himself as sort of a journalistic spirit guide to all those who might be looking for the tapes. He even compared himself to the central source in Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein's Watergate reporting: ""A friend, called up, very coincidentally, and said, 'You're like Tweet Throat.' I said, 'What do you mean?' He said, 'You're like Mark Felt telling all the Woodsteins out there to follow the money to bring down Nixon.' "" Soon after he sent the tweet--which has been retweeted and liked more than 75,000 times--the New York Times called him to ask about it, his voicemail filled up, and he started receiving threats against his life. ""I'm getting death threats from total strangers, who I think are paranoid and nervous--and rightly so--of what they think I'm holding, as if I've got this big bomb that could blow up in everybody's face,"" Pruitt said. ""That's indicative of the climate we live in, too, and what Trump's agenda has been."" Word has trickled out in various media reports of some of the material that might be on all those hours of footage. An early-season editor named Jim Ruxin told me that part of the job was saving Trump from himself, which resulted in one of the more interesting on-the-record anecdotes I heard. In one episode in the first season that I watched to get a better understanding of the show, I noticed how in the boardroom scenes where Trump is considering his decisions about whom to fire, there were moments where the camera would cut away from his face as he was sharing a thought, and the voice would seem to become disjointed. Ruxin explained that this was called a ""Frankenbite"" in reality TV parlance and was not uncommon in the industry: The disjointed-sounding Trump dialogue was edited in after the fact to replace whatever he'd said in the moment. Ruxin remembered a particular Frankenbite from the first season. Trump was setting up to fire a contestant named Troy McClain, who had not been to college. According to Ruxin, Trump said something along the lines of, You've never been to college and I have fancy sophisticated dinner parties all the time. And I can't have you there. Basically, Trump was insulting in the crudest possible fashion those who lacked college degrees--a group that 12 years later would end up being his largest base of voters. ""The line that was invented [to replace that] was, 'You're a loose cannon and I can't have that in my organization,' "" Ruxin told me. I looked up the footage, and sure enough, the edit played out pretty much as Ruxin remembered it. ""That's typical of what went on to protect Trump from himself in the boardroom,"" Ruxin said. Another early-season editor, Jonathon Braun, told me about his fellow editors feeling a ""communal guilt about making him seem something that he's not"" for the way they portrayed Trump in the series as an epitome of American success. At one point, I went to the home of a sound guy who BuzzFeed reported had said that Trump had repeatedly called him a ""fucking monkey."" What BuzzFeed didn't report--and what feels relevant given Trump's reported abuse of deaf actress Marlee Matlin and a campaign incident in which he appeared to mimic and mock a disabled reporter--is that the ""fucking monkey"" sound guy was hearing impaired. (He declined to talk to me on the record.) I also heard some unsurprising anecdotes about how Trump's ""locker-room talk"" spilled over into the show. ""The thing that stood out to me is that he would refer to a woman as an 'it' or a 'that' and it just seemed awfully demeaning to me,"" one former producer who wanted to remain anonymous told me. That included talking about how he wanted to ""drill that,"" in reference to women on set, and at one point during a scene shot at the Playboy Mansion, he said of a woman ""it looks good in a bikini,"" according to this producer. The former producer also told me that during the Playboy Mansion shoot, Trump--who had recently married Melania--was recorded asking to be set up with Playmates. ""I remember him talking, I'm pretty sure it was to Hef himself, about some of the women that were around and especially Playmates and talking about how he would like to be hooked up with them,"" the former producer told me. ""Somebody said to him, 'You're married, you just recently got married.' "" The former producer continued: ""He was just so cavalier. ... He didn't give a shit. He just didn't care if anybody heard it or not."" A few days after I was told about the Playboy Mansion shoot, the Wall Street Journal reported that the National Enquirer paid to suppress a story about Trump having an affair with a Playmate. Again, these stories were fairly innocuous; Trump might even view them as image-bolstering. Why wouldn't the former producer go on the record? He said he was concerned potential employers might not be eager to hire someone so gabby about a former workplace. I heard some variation of this a lot: People weren't afraid of lawsuits; they were afraid that talking on the record might damage or torpedo future career possibilities with other productions. ""I think people don't want to risk anything, because that's our livelihood, that's how we make our money,"" said another former employee who didn't want to speak on the record, even though he said he had nothing Earth-shattering to share. ""People are afraid that they might not get hired, and you never know why you might not get hired,"" Braun said. ""You just never know. The smart move is to just not say anything and to just go along, play along."" One name came up on multiple occasions as someone who might have information about the big thing: Katherine Walker, a first-season producer who spoke with the Associated Press for its big Apprentice story. But multiple messages to Walker via phone, email, and social media accounts went unreturned. I knocked on three separate apartment doors that had been listed for Walker and was told in two instances that she no longer lived at those addresses, and on a third that she didn't live there. On Facebook, Walker has written that she was unhappy with the AP's story, so perhaps that was why she was reluctant to talk. In a personal blog post published last week, Walker talked about the work that went into crafting the Trump image and spoke cryptically about what that might mean for the final days of the election:"	Sources Say Trump Behaved Badly on The Apprentice Set. Why Didn't Anyone Leak a Tape?
4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/here_are_the_chances_your_vote_matters.html	Voters are heading to the polls tomorrow, many of them taking off work or forgoing other activities to vote. So now is a good time to double-check: Is it rational to vote? And, by extension, was it worth your while to pay attention to whatever the candidates and party leaders have been saying for the last year or so? With the chance of casting a decisive vote being comparable to the chance of winning the lottery, what is the gain from being a good citizen and casting your vote? The short answer is quite a lot. First the bad news. With over 100 million voters, your chance that your vote will be decisive--even if the national election were predicted to be reasonably close--is, at best, 1 in 1 million in a battleground state and much less in a noncompetitive state. (The calculation is based on the chance that your state's vote will be exactly tied, along with the chance that your state's electoral votes are necessary for one candidate or the other to win the presidency. Both these conditions are necessary for your vote to be decisive, and both are highly unlikely.) So by that measure, voting doesn't seem like such a good investment. But here's the good news. If your vote is decisive, it will make a difference for over 300 million people. If you think your preferred candidate could bring the equivalent of a $100 improvement in the quality of life to the average American--not an implausible number, given the size of the federal budget and the impact of decisions in foreign policy, health, the courts, and other areas--you're now buying a $30 billion lottery ticket. With this payoff, a 1 in 10 million chance of being decisive isn't bad odds. And many people do see it that way. Surveys show that voters choose based on who they think will do better for the country as a whole rather than their personal betterment. Indeed, when it comes to voting, it is irrational to be selfish, but if you care how others are affected, it can be a smart calculation to cast your ballot, because the returns to voting are so high for everyone if you are decisive. Voting and vote choice (including related actions such as the decision to gather information in order to make an informed vote) are rational in large elections only to the extent that voters are not selfish. That's also the reason for contributing money to a candidate: Large contributions, or contributions to local elections, could conceivably be justified as providing access or the opportunity to directly influence policy. But small-dollar contributions to national elections, like voting, can be better motivated by the possibility of large social benefit than by any direct benefit to you. Such civically motivated behavior is consistent with both small and large anonymous contributions to charity. So, yes, if you are in a state that even might be close, it is rational to vote. Pierre-Antoine Kremp and I estimated the probability of a single vote being decisive for residents of any state (ignoring complications in those states that can split their electoral vote). Here are the places where you would have the highest chance of deciding the election with just one vote: What if you live somewhere--such as New York or California or Kansas or Alabama--that will almost certainly not be a swing state? Then, yes, there's essentially zero chance your vote will be decisive in the election: In the highly unlikely event that your state is tied so that your vote would swing it, the national election would be so lopsided that your state wouldn't be needed for an Electoral College coalition. That's why we estimate the probability your vote would swing the election to be less than 1 in 1 billion in the four states mentioned above. Even in those states, though, I'd still recommend you cast a vote for president, if you care about the election and you think it's important for the general good if your candidate wins. Why? Because the election could be close, and there's a small chance that your vote could determine the winner of the popular vote. The popular-vote winner doesn't count for anything technically, but it does give some legitimacy. Or, your vote might be enough to cause a change in the rounded popular vote, for example changing the outcome from 50-50 (to the nearest percentage point) to 51-49. Or enough to make the vote margin in 2016 exceed Barack Obama's margin over Mitt Romney in 2012. Any of these can affect perceptions of legitimacy and mandates. This is not nearly as important as determining the Electoral College winner, but in a political environment where Donald Trump is rejected by many in his own party and where some Republican senators are declaring that they would not consider any of Hillary Clinton's Supreme Court nominees, a perception of electoral legitimacy could make a difference. It could be worth doing your part to increase the chance that your candidate has a legitimizing share of the popular vote. Sometimes when writing on this topic, I get the response that a single vote can never matter because if a state election is so close to being tied, there would be a recount anyway. It turns out that this does not materially affect the probability of a vote being decisive, because a single vote can also be what triggers a recount. See the appendix on the last page of this article for a full explanation--with calculus!	Will Your Vote Decide the Election? It's Unlikely--but How Unlikely?

How did we get here? Read on. It has been 13 months since Donald Trump announced his presidential bid and, in the same speech, called Mexican immigrants rapists. The ensuing drip feed of Trumpian absurdities and offenses has had a desensitizing effect. We know that Trump is a racist, a misogynist, an authoritarian, and a narcissist, but we've lost track of the many, many specific things he has said and done that disqualify him from the office he seeks. So we have compiled a list of specific things that make Trump an unacceptable candidate for the presidency. Some are policy proposals that should be outside the bounds of debate, like punitive torture. Some are casual vulgarities, like his description of Rosie O'Donnell. You might not agree that each individual item on the list is disqualifying in isolation--you can vote those down, and vote up the ones you find especially egregious--but the list's cumulative weight makes its own statement. Disclaimer: Trump contradicts himself a lot. Not all of the policy positions listed here reflect his current thinking on a given subject. You'll have to decide for yourself whether you find that reassuring. Update, Aug. 1, 2016: We originally listed 141 items here. But Trump doesn't stop saying and doing unpresidential things, so we'll continue to update the list through Election Day. New items will appear at the top of the list under ""Recent Trump Moments"" for a while, until they are replaced by fresher instances of self-disqualification. Correction, July 18, 2016: This post originally described the Central Park Five as ""five black men."" One of the five, Raymond Santana, is Latino, and all were between 14 and 16 at the time of the attack."	230 Things Donald Trump Has Said and Done That Make Him Unfit to Be President
6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/trump_s_endless_rally_in_virginia.html	"LEESBURG, Virginia--Get stuck in traffic. Park on the side of Route 7. Walk across an overpass and onto residential streets. There are no lights. Eventually you reach a cop, who directs you down a bike path. And about a quarter of a mile down the bike path is where the line begins. Or at least it does around 8:30 p.m., an hour before Donald Trump is scheduled to speak at the Loudoun County Fairgrounds in Leesburg, Virginia, and three hours and 50 minutes before he actually does. The line continues in total darkness, save for the glow of the stars and scattered cellphone flashlights, for at least another quarter-mile. Welcome to midnight with Donald Trump, on what, by the time he spoke, was the eve of the 2016 presidential election. In these last few days, Trump is working a grueling campaign schedule, doing nearly a half-dozen rallies a day in disparate parts of the country, some sensible (Pennsylvania, Florida, North Carolina), some less so (he was in Minnesota on Sunday, picking some nit with Somali refugees). The midnight rally in Virginia--a state that's always been a distant reach, but one that he's never quite given up on--was the final rally of his tightly packed five-event Sunday. That meant delays. I spoke with one couple, Greg and Andrea Masters of Leesburg, who left their house around 5 or 5:30. They waited in line for hours. When I spoke to them around 9 they had just gotten inside the rally hall, a large hangarlike enclosure on the fairgrounds suitable to fit a few thousand souls. I told them that the latest murmurs had Trump scheduled to land at Dulles International Airport, about a 20- to 30-minute drive away--let's say 15 with a Secret Service motorcade--at 11. They shrugged. I asked the Masterses about FBI Director James Comey and his supplementary letter sent Sunday saying his bureau, after looking through a bunch of emails it had already seen, had found nothing new. Had they heard? ""While we were walking out the door,"" they acknowledged, showing just how long a day it had been for those traveling to Trump's midnight rally. They didn't seem fazed. Clinton's ""emails were just part of a pattern of corruption."" They can charge her or not. Comey's second failed opportunity to indict her was just background noise to this crowd. They would have liked it, sure. But it doesn't matter one way or another. They know that she is a criminal, even if the official word of the FBI is that it disagrees. Leesburg is right on the border of the Northern Virginia suburbs. In the famous words of 2008 John McCain spokeswoman Nancy Pfotenhauer, this is ""real Virginia."" About an hour outside of Washington, it's the last major outpost past the Dulles Toll Road of the D.C. suburbs, beyond which lies the more rural ""real"" Virginia of Winchester and the Appalachian Mountains. The crowd was an interesting mix of ""real Virginians""--camo Make America Great Again hats and shirts, ""Guns SAVE Lives"" stickers--and less ostentatious suburbanites. Sherry Reynolds lives in McLean, the well-to-do Virginia suburb about 25 minutes outside of Washington. She fits the profile of a #NeverTrump type found in great profusion in the Beltway suburbs: a military wife (and mother) and recently retired government and economics teacher who supported Sen. Marco Rubio in the primaries. But she's been impressed with how Trump has honed his message in recent months, and more importantly she hates the Clintons. I asked her about the follow-up Comey letter. She hadn't heard and didn't seem to care. ""I am tired of the corruption with the Clinton machine,"" she said. ""There's plenty of other things ... there's plenty of other things that she could be charged for."" She was upset, for example, with the deterioration of America's position around the globe and the lives we lost in Benghazi, Libya, during Clinton's State Department tenure. She said she's followed the Clintons since the '80s and that there are ""plenty of people who are no longer living who wanted to talk about"" the Clintons' corruption, but no one would listen. ""They just magically disappeared--like Vince Foster."" The emails are nothing. Who cares what Comey does or doesn't do? They're a blip in a long line of obvious, odious, and comprehensive criminality. This is the long-held anti-Clinton suspicion that Trump has hardened into a state of absolute fact among his supporters. And it's why Comey's ""supplementary"" letter to Congress saying explicitly that Clinton will not face criminal charges needn't interrupt the narrative Trump and his surrogates had already assembled for the evening. It certainly didn't stop the chants of ""Lock her up!"" that overtook the crowd about every 10 minutes, for hours. ""I have good news: Mr. Trump has landed ... "" the event's emcee said around 10:30, at the beginning of the night's program. The crowd went wild. "" ... in Pennsylvania,"" he continued. But he promised excellent entertainment in the meantime, whereupon he introduced former Sen. Rick Santorum. Santorum performed in his usual manner of a man working through a terrific bout of constipation. He got the crowd going most with one line. ""Hillary Clinton may be the first person running for president to serve more than eight years,"" he said, his wit perhaps outstripping his history here. ""And it will all depend on good behavior."" It was the first of several speeches that seemed to elide any mention of the FBI or Comey. Didn't matter. She's a crook, and they know she will somehow go to jail even when the authorities that would be jailing her announce they will do no such thing. Former Rep. Tom Davis, continuing the trend, joked about how he left Congress undefeated ""and unindicted."" It was here that I began to wonder how many Trump supporters honestly believe that Clinton is under indictment. George Allen, the former senator who lost his seat after calling a young brown man ""Macaca,"" spoke at 11:34 p.m. He spoke of how Clinton wants to change the name of the Washington NFL team. Oliver North, who actually was indicted as part of a real scandal that threatened our entire system of government, began speaking at 11:40. This was right around when Trump landed at Dulles and embarked toward Leesburg without the traveling press corps. Around 12:10, a flickering line of red and blue flashers could be seen along the tree lines near the fairgrounds. Trump was here, and after one more introduction from Jerry Falwell Jr., he came to speak in the first general election eve rally of his political lifetime. ""Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of president of the United States,"" Trump said, after an opening Obamacare riff. The ""lock her up"" chants began right away, crisply in sync. ""Right now, she's being protected by a totally rigged system. ... This is a rigged system. This is a rigged system. Hillary Clinton is guilty. She knows it, the FBI knows it."" And everyone in this room has never known anything more. ""I'm asking you to dream big,"" he said, after the usual bragging about polls and the talking points about building the wall, keeping refugees out, cutting taxes, creating jobs, eliminating regulations, and making America great again, ""because with your vote, in just--"" He recognized that it was after midnight. ""Now I actually have to say one day. One day. ONE DAY!"" He hesitated as the roar cascaded into a ""Trump!"" ""One DAY, I can't believe it."" One day away. For old time's sake, he reminisced about all of the candidates he beat in the primaries, and then he sent Virginia on its way. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

But as our Editor-in-Chief Julia Turner put it this summer when she announced the VoteCastr partnership: ""The role of journalists is to bring information to people, not to protect them from it."" For the first time, you'll have access to the same kind of data that campaigns use to monitor voting activity and frame their thinking throughout Election Day. We teamed up with VoteCastr because we don't think there's any good reason the candidates and their teams should have a monopoly on that kind of information. Why do we trust the VoteCastr team? Its staff is stocked with leading data experts from both sides of the aisle. Those staffers include Blaise Hazelwood, who served as the political director for the Republican National Committee and managed Election Day reporting for George W. Bush in 2004, and Ken Strasma, the chief of microtargeting for Barack Obama in 2008. Here's how the VoteCastr system operates. By combining proprietary, large-sample polls taken prior to Election Day with targeted, real-time tracking of voter turnout on Tuesday, VoteCastr will make rolling projections of how many ballots have been cast for each candidate in each of the states we're tracking: Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. If you visit Slate at 11 a.m. EST on Tuesday, you'll see projections for how many votes have been cast for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in each of those states as of 11 a.m. (VoteCastr will also analyze the vote in Colorado, albeit using a different technique. More on that in a bit.) It's crucial to remember these projections are being made in real time. Even if we were to assume the VoteCastr models are perfect--and we won't--they can't tell us who will win a particular state, only who is winning that state at a specific moment in time and who might win if current trends continue. When it comes to who might win, the emphasis should be on might. There are too many unknowns for us to be able say with confidence that what we think is happening in the present will continue to happen in the future. It's entirely possible, for instance, that Trump voters will be more likely to cast their ballots in the morning and that Clinton voters will be more likely to cast theirs in the evening--or vice versa. There just isn't enough historical data to give us meaningful insight on that type of voter behavior. Over the course of the day, we expect Clinton's and Trump's respective shares of the total vote in each state to shift as turnout waxes in some areas and wanes in others. Slate readers will be able to watch live as those vote totals update throughout Election Day. They'll also be able to sort the data in a number of different ways. We'll make it possible, for instance, to compare real-time turnout in Trump-leaning counties and Clinton-leaning counties, as well as to gauge turnout in counties grouped by age, income, and race. If our real-time trackers are seeing that turnout in Pennsylvania's middle class or predominantly black counties has surpassed 2012 levels, you'll know that. If turnout in Ohio counties that are predominantly white or lower class does the same, you'll know that, too. We also hope to use the VoteCastr model to bring some empiricism to all the anecdotes that pop up in the news on Election Day. If there's rain in Cincinnati, a viral photo of long lines in Las Vegas, or an unplanned appearance by Tim Kaine in Philadelphia, we won't have to speculate about whether those events will cause turnout to rise or fall. We'll be able to look at the numbers and draw conclusions--albeit tentative ones--ourselves. * * * Here's a longer description of how this whole thing works. The project can be broken down into two phases: what happens before Tuesday, and what happens on the day itself. In the lead-up to Election Day, VoteCastr conducted large-sample surveys in eight battleground states. Unlike a typical media poll that might ask hundreds of respondents dozens of questions, these surveys presented thousands of people with just a handful of queries each. The results were then run through predictive models to determine the probabilities of each voter in each of the eight states casting a ballot for Clinton, Trump, Gary Johnson, or Jill Stein. (VoteCastr did not include Evan McMullin in its models. The independent candidate is only on the ballot in two states we are tracking, Colorado and Iowa.) The other piece of the pre-Election Day puzzle is early voting, which now accounts for an estimated 30 to 40 percent of the general election vote. Local officials collect and report information about who voted early in each state in advance of the election, and VoteCastr then compares that public info with its own private voter files. To understand how this works in practice, consider my early ballot, which I cast in Iowa City last week. Though VoteCastr doesn't know who I voted for, it can make an educated guess based on the things it does know about me: my age, race, and party registration. Our friends at VoteCastr tell me the model believes there's a 97 percent chance I voted for Clinton. When my name shows up on the list of people who voted early in the Hawkeye State, VoteCastr will use that number to fill in the blank. These voter preference estimates allow VoteCastr to make more specific forecasts about the early voting split than most other modelers, which simply sort returned ballots by party registration. (For what it's worth, the model got it right in my case: I voted for Clinton.) That's the easy part. If everyone voted before Election Day, the final outcome would be pretty easy to predict even without a fancy model. The challenge for VoteCastr and other prognosticators is to figure out which voters will make the trip to their local polling stations and which will stay home. That's where the day-of tracking comes in. VoteCastr will have hundreds of field workers stationed at preselected precincts around the country. Those field workers will be reporting official turnout numbers as they're provided to them by poll workers throughout the day. By selecting a representative mix of precincts, VoteCastr will extrapolate the turnout in similar precincts that aren't being tracked, in the same way it used large-sample polling to draw probabilistic conclusions about how I was going to cast my vote without surveying me directly. Let's assume there's a particular precinct in Wisconsin in which pre-Election Day polling suggests voter preference for Clinton and Trump is split 50-50. If a field worker stationed there reports that 100 votes were cast in the first hour of voting, VoteCastr won't simply assume that 50 of those votes were for Trump and 50 were for Clinton. The model will also factor in how likely it believes Clinton supporters in that precinct are to vote compared to Trump supporters. Let's consider a simple hypothetical in which each of Trump's likely voters in our Wisconsin precinct is more likely to vote than each of Clinton's likely voters. If projected turnout is low, then we can assume the more-energized Trump supporters will vote in greater numbers than Clinton supporters. If turnout is high, then we can assume there will be more parity--that the high turnout is an indication that less-energized likely Clinton voters did show up to vote on Election Day. VoteCastr's projections will work a little differently in Colorado, where the vast majority of ballots are cast by mail ahead of Tuesday. On account of that, VoteCastr won't be tracking real-time turnout in Colorado. Instead, it will rely on the same technique it used to sort the early vote in other states, making projections by comparing its private voter files--which include the poll-derived preference scores for each voter--with the public roll of who returned their ballots. That means the VoteCastr projections for Colorado won't change throughout Election Day like they will for other states; the numbers we have in the morning will be the same ones we have all day. * * * That's how the VoteCastr system will work in theory. It's possible, however, that reality will introduce a few surprises. For starters, projections are only as good as the models that make them, which are only as good as the polling data they use. If there's some sort of shy-voter effect, or respondents are being in any other way dishonest with the pollsters (or themselves) about who they are going to vote for, the projections could easily miss the mark. Likewise, there's the possibility of a late swing in the race that VoteCastr polling misses. As with all polling, some uncertainty is unavoidable. (VoteCastr tells me its own polls have generally been in line with publicly available polls.) There's also the not-so-small issue of Clinton's and Trump's respective ground games, or lack thereof. The VoteCastr model relies heavily on 2012 voting to predict the likelihood of whether someone will vote in 2016. The consensus four years ago was that Obama's get-out-the-vote operation was better than Mitt Romney's, but only by a relatively slim margin. There's good reason to believe that Clinton's advantage over Trump will be considerably larger than that. If that turns out to be true, Clinton supporters may be more likely to vote than comparable Trump supporters simply because they're more likely to get knocks on their doors on Election Day from campaign volunteers. The VoteCastr model can't account for that. Setting aside the model, there's one more problem to consider: me. On Election Day, I will be doing my best to provide the context and analysis readers need to understand the VoteCastr data. But I'm only human, and I'm coming in with my own preconceptions. Based on what I've observed during the final months of this campaign, I believe Clinton is the favorite to win the general election. And so there is always a chance that I will (perhaps unconsciously) seek out patterns that confirm that prediction, or I will fail to spot evidence suggesting the opposite outcome. Conversely, now that I've acknowledged this bias, it's possible I'll overcompensate and swing too far the other way. Ultimately, it's best to think of this Slate-VoteCastr collaboration as a real-time Election Day experiment. The VoteCastr projections are based on vast amounts of data, but this specific model has never been tested on this scale. If it works as planned, it'll provide us with fascinating insights into what's happening on the ground on the final day of one of the most unpredictable campaigns in recent memory. It can also help us answer long-standing electoral mysteries, like whether certain kinds of voters go to the polls at different times of the day. And if all else fails, we'll still be giving you a taste of how campaign insiders see Election Day and how they see you as voters. We think that's a valuable exercise, and we're excited to have you along for the ride. Read VoteCastr's official methodology documentation here."

You will be hard-pressed to find a better encapsulation of America's surreal politics in 2016 than the previous sentence. Running as a Republican, Duke was one of six candidates who qualified for a final debate in the race to replace David Vitter as Louisiana's next U.S. senator. Technically speaking, Duke was invited because he earned 5.1 percent support in a single poll commissioned by Raycom Media, which produced the debate. The poll had a 4 percent margin of error. But everyone knew the real reason Duke was onstage. He is hate porn, and his mere presence ensures a spectacle. He's bad for America and good for ratings. This, too, is American politics in 2016. Even C-SPAN aired the debate. ""I'm not opposed to all Jews,"" Duke said at one point, after a moderator asked why he'd referred to reporters covering Trump as ""CNN Jews."" He said he opposed a secret ""cabal"" controlling the media and banks. ""I'm against Jews, or anybody else, that puts the interest of some other place, another country over our own country,"" he continued, referring to Israel, ""that is controlling and dominating the media, which is teaching black people and inspiring black people to hate white people."" Duke accused Black Lives Matter protesters of murdering police officers. He claimed millions of illegal immigrants were getting welfare and Social Security. He called himself Trump's ""most loyal advocate."" When he wasn't advocating that Hillary Clinton be executed by electric chair, he was trafficking in anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, and when he was doing neither, he was beefing to the moderator and throwing a tantrum. ""Are you going to silence me?"" Duke screamed at one point until the moderator allowed him to speak. Most surreal of all was that he did all this in a mostly empty auditorium. Raycom had banned all students and media from attending, perhaps because Duke had suggested to media outlets beforehand that Dillard's student body was a danger to him. The narrow entrance to the debate had been barricaded, and when students tried to push through the doors of their own auditorium, university police pepper-sprayed the crowd. People kept trying to enter to no avail. So the protest unfolded outside--about 150 protesters in all, many of them Dillard students, chanting ""No KKK, no fascist USA."" The sun had gone down, and most of the light came from the flashing lights of parked police cars. Some students were furious at Dillard's president, Walter Kimbrough, shouting that he was an ""Uncle Tom"" for allowing the debate to happen at all. The university had agreed to host before Duke was invited, and apparently by then it was too late to pull out. Dillard was bound by contract to host. ""We weren't able to change the location of the event,"" Jazmin Clemons, a Dillard sophomore, told Slate. ""Most of the student body decided to stand by [the university president] to let it be held."" Kimbrough told the Baton Rouge Advocate he thought the polling had been rigged. ""Former klansman at historically black college. That's the headline,"" he said. ""And it's not fair to Dillard."" As a political matter, Duke is no threat to win anything. In truth he is a habitual loser. He won a single special election in 1989 for the state House of Representatives. But in 1975 and 1979, he ran for the Louisiana legislature and lost. He ran for president in 1980, 1988, and 1992 and was never even a blip. He ran for Congress in 1990, 1996, and 1999 and lost. In 1991, at the height of his political power, he ran for Louisiana governor and was crushed by a 22 percent margin--but he still received 39 percent of the vote. This year, he will lose again. He has no real support. During the primary season, Trump pointedly refused to disavow Duke's endorsement, but on Thursday Trump's son Eric Trump told a Denver radio host that ""a guy like David Duke is disgusting"" and that Duke ""deserves a bullet."" Duke is too toxic even for America's most toxic national politician. During the debate, Duke celebrated the fact that he was being protested outside. ""They don't even know the names of these other guys and lady,"" he said of his competitors. Surely this wasn't true, but he was correct insofar as no protester was there for the other folks onstage. On Thursday night, not only did Duke win the thing he's always known how to win--attention--but his presence in a formal political debate, rather than diminish him and his ideas, had succeeded in warping the whole scene around him.

9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/daniel_blackman_is_the_first_black_person_ever_to_run_for_office_in_georgia.html	"The most controversial candidate on the ballot in my native Forsyth County, Georgia, about 40 miles north of Atlanta, is not Donald Trump. It's Daniel Blackman, a Democrat running for the state senate, who is notable simply for being on the ballot at all. What makes Blackman's bid so surprising, and potentially historic, is that he is the first black person ever to run for office in Forsyth. How, you might ask, is that possible in America, in 2016? The answer lies in Forsyth's long history of racial violence and its reputation, for much of the 20th century, as Georgia's most dangerous ""white county."" I grew up in Forsyth, and during my childhood there I heard the legend many times: how ""a long, long time ago,"" a young white woman was found beaten and bloody in the woods. When she died a few weeks later, people said, bands of white men terrorized the county's black citizens, who had no choice but to run for their lives. I've spent much of the past decade searching for the truth behind that old ghost story and documenting not just that the racial cleansing of Forsyth took place but where, when, how, and to whom. I learned that over the course of two months, in September and October of 1912, whites violently expelled all 1,098 members of what had been a large and vibrant black community. The terror campaign was fueled by widespread hysteria, as whites became convinced that a ""black rebellion"" was underway. Deep-seated bigotry was undoubtedly a precondition for the racial cleansing, but its immediate cause was powerful and irrational fear. Viewed from the other end of the 20th century, the paranoia of local whites seems downright pathological. The black people of Forsyth were field hands, sharecroppers, servants, cooks, schoolteachers, and tradesmen, but in the popular imagination of the county's whites they were something more sinister. The papers described a group of poor black teenagers as ""fiendish ... low-browed, gorilla-type negroes"" and claimed that they had raped and bludgeoned an 18-year-old white woman named Mae Crow. In the wake of her death, white mobs set out across the county, using shotguns, torches, kerosene, and sticks of dynamite to drive black residents from their homes. Scores of sharecroppers' cabins were set ablaze, and in October the local mayor wrote to the governor, warning that five black churches had been burned to the ground. By the close of 1912, it was widely reported that every single black resident had fled the violence and that the mobs of Forsyth had successfully created a ""whites-only"" world in the Georgia foothills. The events of 1912 might sound like ancient history, but when I was in high school, the angry white people of Forsyth once again made national news, after a clash in 1987. That was the year peace marchers--including my mother, father, and sister--protested the ongoing segregation of the county and were set upon by furious counterprotesters, who threw rocks, bottles, and bricks in an effort to drive black marchers out of the county and to enforce the 75-year-old racial ban. The first ""Brotherhood March"" had to be abandoned after local police began arresting armed men in the crowd, and the following week 20,000 peace marchers came to Forsyth, to celebrate the Martin Luther King national holiday and to speak out against Georgia's last bastion of de facto segregation. Much has changed in the 30 years since, and in 2016 the county's population is now 10 percent Latino, 8 percent Asian, and 3 percent black. A Georgia native and the son of a former Army ranger, Blackman and his wife Jeanelle moved to Forsyth in 2012 and currently have three children attending Forsyth County schools. With no personal experience of the county's troubled past, they are part of a wave of newcomers who have helped to dispel the county's old reputation for bigotry. The Forsyth they know is a typical affluent suburb of Atlanta, and on land that was once stolen from black farmers, there are now shopping malls, gleaming medical centers, and gated communities full of multimillion-dollar homes. But in a place that was ""whites only"" for nearly a century--and which began to tolerate a small group of black residents only in the mid-1990s, when tens of thousands of newcomers began moving north from Atlanta--American politics in 2016 rings with old echoes. While Blackman is running on a moderate platform of jobs creation, renewable energy, and public transportation, his opponent, incumbent Michael Williams, is a full-blown member of the Trumpish right. He has embraced even the most widely condemned Trump proposals, including his calls for a ban on all immigration by Muslims and the creation of a national ""Muslim registry."" On his campaign website, Williams defends the idea of a religious test for those seeking entry into the U.S. and says the threat from Muslim immigrants ""should be frightening to anyone."" In Forsyth, the anti-Muslim xenophobia of men like Trump and Williams is a return to all too familiar ways. And while Blackman may be fighting an uphill battle in a place once synonymous with bigotry, his decision to run for elected office here is an act of bravery--a confrontation not just with the ugly politics of his opponent but with history itself. Forsyth's current prosperity rests on a foundation of lynching, arson, and communal theft, but Blackman's campaign has given the people of the county a chance to commit an act of quiet revolution: to rebuke that shameful past and turn toward a more just future.

10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/the_trump_server_evaluating_new_evidence_and_countertheories.html	"On Monday, I published a reported piece that raised questions about a server owned by the Trump Organization. The server appeared to be unusually configured, and to communicate almost exclusively with two servers registered to Alfa Bank in Moscow. The piece followed a group of computer scientists who had stumbled upon the Trump server in July, and it told the story of how they deployed their expertise to make sense of their discovery. The story required voyaging deep into the arcana of the internet. The key piece of evidence for the server's strange behavior was a set of logs of Domain Name Server, or DNS, look-ups. These are the communications between servers that enable an email to reach its destination. The computer scientists had no actual examples of email exchanged between Trump and Alfa--only inferences about that prospect, based on their close reading of the logs. I spoke with many DNS experts. They found the evidence strongly suggestive of a relationship between the Trump Organization and the bank but not conclusive. It was a subject that I believed deserved public airing and further exploration. Publication of my article was quickly followed by responses from the Trump campaign and Alfa Bank, both of which offered more detailed accounts of the server activity than they had provided when I'd asked them for comment. My piece also elicited a series of valuable objections and credible alternate theories from technology reporters and other computer scientists. I take these seriously and believe they also deserve public airing and exploration. Several of the critiques of the hypothesis offered by the experts in my piece offer simpler, more benign explanations for the server activity. I'll describe them here. 1) Does Trump control the server in question? In a detailed post critiquing my piece, cybersecurity expert Rob Graham wrote, ""The evidence available on the Internet is that Trump neither (directly) controls the domain trump-email.com, nor has access to the server."" This echoes the point raised by Vox, the Intercept, and others that the server was not operated by the Trump Organization directly. Rather, it was run and managed by Cendyn, a vendor that organizes email marketing campaigns for hotels and resorts. This suggests that most of the emails that emanated from this address were mass emails, related to loyalty programs, discount offers, and the like. At first, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told me the server ""has not been used since 2010."" She continued, ""To be clear, The Trump Organization is not sending or receiving any communications from this email server."" The Intercept has since turned up at least two examples of a Trump email, promoting hotels, being sent from that server in 2015 and 2016. Critics were right to focus on the relationship with Cendyn as a weak point in the theory. None of the computer scientists in my original story has an evidence-based explanation for why anyone at the Trump Organization would have used this server for the purposes of communicating with Alfa. The contention was that Cendyn is an organization trusted by the Trump Organization to host email. But clearly there would be easier ways to go about maintaining a quiet channel of communications than to work through a server operated by a vendor. One of the intriguing facts in my original piece was that the Trump server was shut down on Sept. 23, two days after the New York Times made inquiries to Alfa Bank (and a week before the Times reached out to Trump). Was Cendyn acting on Trump's behalf when it shut down mail1.trump-email.com? I can't say for sure. (Cendyn didn't reply to my request for comment.) This may all be pure coincidence. Perhaps Cendyn shut down the server for bureaucratic reasons, such as Trump's failure to renew it, or perhaps Cendyn shut down the domain for very good technical reasons. ""They may have shut it down to do a forensic analysis. Or they may have thought, in response to the inquiry, that the server was infected. It may actually have been infected,"" Cornell University's Emin Gun Sirer told me on Wednesday. Neither the Trump campaign nor Cendyn has offered an explanation for the shutting down of mail1.trump-email.com. 2) Could the communication with Alfa have been spam or marketing email? In the statements they released after the publication of my piece, the Trump campaign and Alfa Bank provide different explanations for the DNS look-ups. According to Alfa, they were likely the result of its security systems furiously swatting away spam being sent by the Trump server. According to Trump, another Cendyn client, a bank, was using its servers to operate a ""meeting management"" application that allowed it to coordinate meetings with Alfa. The Trump campaign statement doesn't name the bank. It's strange that Cendyn would allow another client to use the Trump-owned servers, though it's certainly possible. It's also strange that investigators from Mandiant, the cybersecurity firm hired by Alfa to investigate, wouldn't have easily found evidence of the meeting application and declared the case closed. Was the server sending spam--unsolicited mail--as opposed to legitimate commercial marketing? There are databases that assiduously and comprehensively catalog spam. I entered the internet protocal address for mail1.trump-email.com to check if it ever showed up in Spamhaus and DNSBL.info. There were no traces of the IP address ever delivering spam. Perhaps the spam went uncataloged because it was being sent to a single bank in Russia, but L. Jean Camp, an Indiana University computer scientist and a source in my original story, thought that possibility unlikely. ""It's highly implausible that spam would continue for so many months, that it would never be reported to spam blocker, or that nobody else in the world would see the spam during that time frame,"" she told me. More likely, the Trump server was sending marketing material, like the emails the Intercept found from 2015 and 2016. Again, Hope Hicks says the Trump Organization no longer uses that server--and she denied the existence of any email sent to Alfa. It's certainly possible that the campaign isn't fully aware of every piece of internet marketing being dispersed by the Trump Organization. Or perhaps Cendyn sent mail on Trump's behalf by mistake. Still, the marketing email theory has a few holes. A typical marketing campaign would involve the wide distribution of emails, spreading word of discounted prices and hotel openings far and wide. It seems unlikely that a campaign would so exclusively focus its efforts on a bank in Russia and a health care company in Michigan (which received a small batch of DNS look-ups), even if, as one critic has claimed, executives from Alfa Bank had a penchant for staying in Trump hotels. Again, there may be some perfectly innocuous explanation for this strange behavior. Naadir Jeewa, a consultant who works with systems similar to the ones discussed in the piece, has suggested, ""One of the main reasons I discounted malfeasance is that email systems are terrible. ... [T]he fact that it still works is because of decades of workarounds and hacks to make it marginally secure. And they go wrong, all the time."" 3) Was it a closed server? Another reason the computer scientists in my piece found the server unusual is that it appeared to be configured in such a way to restrict access to all but a few communicants. Several reporters and news outlets have countered by saying, in essence, that the server was ""not quite as shut off from the rest of the web as it seems."" But we know of only three parties that received messages from the server, the vast bulk going to Alfa Bank. (The Intercept correctly notes that 19 IP addresses had looked up the Trump address. This is an unusually small number, and most of the look-ups consisted of IP addresses registered as purveyors of malware. The Intercept also contends that the 19 look-ups might not be a complete list; more on that below.) The scientists theorized that the Trump and Alfa Bank servers had a secretive relationship after testing the behavior of mail1.trump-email.com using sites like Pingability. When they attempted to ping the site, they received the message ""521 lvpmta14.lstrk.net does not accept mail from you."" It's possible to impose restrictions--or, in the case of Cendyn's system, create an access control list--to carefully regulate the number of communicants. We can't be sure that any of these restrictions were deployed. And as the Verge's Russell Brandom pointed out, this approach to communication would hardly remain secret forever: ""If the servers were only meant to talk to each other, why not connect directly, storing the IP-domain link locally and skipping public domain registration entirely? Failing that, why not use a shared email account or any of dozens of private messaging services that leave less of a metadata trail? There are plenty of hard problems in building untraceable chat systems, but avoiding incriminating DNS records isn't one of them."" 4) Does the conversation spike around political events? Vox's Timothy Lee and others have questioned the contention of the computer scientists that traffic between the servers correlated with political happenings in the U.S. ""There's a much smaller spike during the Democratic convention and no apparent increase before or during the Republican convention,"" he noted. ""In short, this chart seems to be totally unrelated to the political calendar."" He wonders why the largest spike occurs in August, after the party conventions. This happened to be a moment of potential interest in Russia, since those weeks were the denouement of the Paul Manafort era in the Trump campaign, with the exposure of logs showing he received $12.7 million in off-the-book payments from the Putin-backed Party of Regions. But Lee's fundamental response is understandable: The chart shows possible correlations, not proven causation. 5) Are the DNS logs complete? The Intercept also looked into this story and decided not to pursue it. One reason was that it doubted my source possessed an unabridged set of DNS logs: ""What percentage of DNS look-ups for Trump's email server could Tea Leaves and his colleagues observe, out of all DNS look-ups for that server on the whole internet? How can they be sure that the majority of DNS look-ups for Trump's email server originated from Alfa Bank, when much of the data they collected didn't even include DNS look-ups from IPs described in their own paper? What's their margin of error? None of the analysis that we (and other journalists) obtained answered these questions."" As I noted in my piece, there's no foolproof way to verify that these logs are complete and unedited. I believe in their authenticity, because of the credibility of the academics and programmers who vouched for them by name--specifically, Paul Vixie and Jean Camp. They took a meaningful risk in attaching their names to the data. Jean Camp has posted the full set of logs. Now that they are easily available, others can form their own opinion as to their validity and what they demonstrate about the servers. I pursued this story because I was impressed by the emphatic belief of the experts I consulted, my suspicions were raised by the evidence they presented, and I thought I would be remiss if I sat on data that I believed deserves to be evaluated and understood before we elect the next president. The underlying context for the piece is that Donald Trump has cultivated a troubling relationship with Russia, and the U.S. government has identified Russia as trying to meddle in this election. Not every nexus between the candidate and Russia is nefarious. This one might well be entirely innocent or even accidental. As the New York Times reported on Tuesday, after my story published, the FBI looked into the server activity but ""ultimately concluded that there could be an innocuous explanation, like a marketing email or spam, for the computer contacts."" Or maybe it's less than innocent, as the computer scientists suggested and still believe. (I've checked back with eight of the nine computer scientists and engineers I consulted for my original story, and they all stood by their fundamental analysis. One of them couldn't be reached.) I concluded my account of these scientists' search for answers by arguing that the servers and their activity deserved further explanation. Hopefully my story and the debate that has followed will move us closer to a fuller understanding."

11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/trump_can_happen_again.html	"On the eve of the election, Slate's revisiting our best stories from the campaign. How did we get here? Read on. Donald Trump is a dud of politician who squandered his advantages in a winnable election. More than just a bad candidate, he has been a catastrophe for the GOP itself. He has destroyed careers, compromised institutions, revealed deep contradictions within the Republican Party, and heightened tensions between its voters and its lawmakers, its activists and its intellectuals. On Nov. 8, nearly 18 months after he announced his bid for the Republican presidential nomination, the saga of Trump will come to a close. If polls are accurate, he will lose. He may even face a landslide, as Hillary Clinton capitalizes on a superior campaign to score victories in states like Arizona, Georgia, and Texas. There's a slim but real chance that, when the smoke clears, Trump will have led the GOP to a historic defeat, handing the White House, the Senate, and the House of Representatives to the Democratic Party. Parties are protean things that respond to big losses by adapting and reconfiguring themselves around the new national median. Outwardly, at least, it would appear as if Trump, by running on a platform of explicit, racialized nationalism and revealing a key split in the GOP, has forced just such a reckoning. But to watch the stretch run of the election is to be struck by the fact that nothing about the Republicans seems to have changed. All the intraparty conditions that created Trump in the first place not only remain but have been reinforced. He may lose the election, but he will have recorded, through sheer bumbling opportunism, an incredible triumph: Like some kind of malignant artificial intelligence, he has installed within the Republican Party all the necessary machinery for replicating himself. The Trump campaign is best seen as a kind of arbitrage play. The ideological coloring it took on had less to do with the candidate's beliefs than with those of the voters who'd grown alienated from their party's leadership. That was the biggest fissure identified by Trump. Coming into the 2016 election, elite Republicans were lining up behind candidates like Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, who offered a familiar package of policies, with reforms on the margin, aimed at building the party's standing with Hispanic voters and working Americans writ large. Rubio, for instance, was a onetime champion for comprehensive immigration reform, shepherding a White House-friendly bill through the Senate before it was killed by a hostile House of Representatives. Likewise, Bush--the other Floridian in the race--had entered as one of the few Republicans with long and durable ties to Hispanic communities. They were following the pattern of parties past, working to adjust after losing a winnable election. But there was a problem. Republican primary voters wanted something different, but they didn't want this. Two months before Trump announced his campaign, in April 2015, the Washington Post and ABC News released one of their regular looks at the views and sentiments of American voters. In this survey, voters gave their priorities. What did they want the next president to support or oppose? On immigration, 46 percent of Americans wanted a president who would reject a path to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants. When split by party, a whopping 70 percent of Republicans--and 78 percent of conservative Republicans--said the next president should be someone who opposes legalization. On the larger question of bipartisan cooperation, 44 percent of Republicans--and 48 percent of conservative Republicans--wanted the next president to ""mainly stand up for their side."" None of this should come as a surprise. The Republican base of 2016 was formed by successive waves of new voters, many of them working-class, all of them white. ""George Wallace Southerners, Ronald Reagan Democrats, Pat Buchanan pitchfork populists and tea-party foot soldiers,"" noted the Wall Street Journal. For as much as Bush and Rubio and others had positioned themselves as sensible reformers, the mood of the actual Republican base was confrontational toward Democrats and hostile to elite conservative attempts to broaden the party's appeal. There was an inefficiency in the market, and Donald Trump made the most of it. He indulged the anger and fear of the Republican base, spinning a narrative in which its members were the victims of Mexican criminals, Chinese industrialists, Muslim terrorists, and incompetent and perhaps treasonous leadership in the form of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. As the election comes to an end, that divide is still here, and it's wider than previously realized. The bulk of Republican voters are in Trump's hands more than anyone else's. Following the release of a 2005 tape in which Trump described his method for sexually assaulting women, a cascade of GOP officials and politicians called for the Republican nominee to resign his position on the ticket. ""While I continue to respect those who still support Donald Trump, I can no longer support him,"" said Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, adding that he will be ""voting Mike Pence for president."" Dozens of Republican lawmakers left the Trump camp. In the moment, it felt as if the party was finally rejecting him. But the reality was different. Even after the tape, anti-Trump elected officials represented a distinct minority of the party. And they were far out of step with the GOP base. In a poll conducted just after the revelations, 74 percent of Republican voters said party officials should continue to support Trump. Far from abandoning their nominee, GOP voters turned on lawmakers, like Paul Ryan, who were critical and reticent in their support. In a Bloomberg Politics poll taken before the final presidential debate, 51 percent of Republicans said that Trump best represents what the GOP should stand for, compared with 33 percent who said the same for Ryan, the speaker of the House and former vice presidential nominee. Seventy-six percent of Republican and Republican-leaning voters said they had a favorable view of Trump, and 38 percent said they would stay loyal to the real estate mogul and follow his future endeavors if he doesn't win. If more traditional Republicans are to beat back Trump's influence, they are going to have to break his hold on GOP voters. So far, that's not in the cards. Indeed, it's made more difficult by the most important shift in the politics of much of the Republican base: an appetite for explicit racism. Remember, Trump didn't come onto the national stage as an advocate for better trade deals. He came onto the national stage as the chief advocate for the racist conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not an American citizen. And even after the president released his birth certificate, Trump continued. For five years afterward, he worked to delegitimize the president as a foreign outsider. When Trump re-emerged in 2015, it was to push another set of racist ideas. As a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination--and now as nominee--Trump has been an advocate against Hispanic immigrants and Muslim migrants, a vocal voice pushing racist ideas into the mainstream, like the idea that all black communities are defined by profound dysfunction and failure. This isn't a lark. It is the core of Trump's political identity. And it's been embraced by millions of Republican voters, who believe that Muslims and immigrants constitute an existential threat to the United States just as much as they think the country has been harmed by free trade and deindustrialization. This mobilization of racial extremism--of a politics centered explicitly on the nationalist grievances of white Americans--has two components. The first is the voters themselves. In the event of a Trump loss, Republican Party elites can't just ignore this group. It's clear, from the outcome of the GOP presidential primary, that they can effectively choose a nominee. At the same time, the fact that voters hold these attitudes doesn't guarantee another Trump event. For that, you need two ingredients: continued tolerance for explicit racism and a set of party actors who will organize and mobilize around Trump's brand of white nationalism. We already have the former. Trump's campaign has made open appeals to white nationalists and white supremacists. Trump's Twitter feed is notorious for broadcasting white nationalist accounts, and key surrogates--like Donald Trump Jr.--have given interviews to figures associated with racist movements. And we know the latter ingredient, party actors, exists. There's the CEO of the Trump campaign, for instance. Stephen Bannon holds known ties to white nationalists. The website he used to preside over, Breitbart News, is both a gathering place for the most racist elements of the right wing and a media outlet for the same, pushing inflammatory stories of black crime, immigrant ""invasion,"" and ""white genocide"" (the idea that liberal elites are perpetrating a cultural ""genocide"" of white Americans). In turn, white nationalists have coalesced around Trump, backing him as an advocate for their interests. During the GOP primary, figures such as Jared Taylor of the ""race realist"" American Renaissance website--a pioneer in the white nationalist movement--recorded robocalls for the Trump campaign. Likewise, a younger generation of activist racists turned to Twitter and forums like Reddit, 4chan, and 8chan to spread the gospel that Trump was the one, a leader who would bring mainstream legitimacy and acceptance to their cause. American political parties are large, porous, and unwieldy. It's rare that they move with any single purpose, and even at their strongest, they are rife with conflict and antagonism. But when they do move, it's toward those groups with the most energy. The Trump campaign has revealed the Breitbart contingent of the GOP to be its most vibrant wing, with substantial support among Republican primary voters. Team Trump understands this, and it plans to use the infrastructure of the campaign to energize (and monetize) this group for future endeavors. Bannon, in particular, sees Trump as a way of destroying the Republican establishment as it exists. He has been a vocal critic of figures like Paul Ryan, using his perch at Breitbart News to denounce the House speaker as a liberal ""globalist."" ""We don't really believe there is a functional conservative party in this country, and we certainly don't think the Republican Party is that,"" said Bannon at a National Press Club conference in 2013. To that point, Trump's recent attacks on Republican figures smack of Bannon's influence. ""Disloyal R's are far more difficult than Crooked Hillary,"" the Republican nominee said on Twitter. ""They come at you from all sides. They don't know how to win--I will teach them!"" The vehicle for this lesson, report Joshua Green and Sasha Issenberg for Bloomberg News, is a massive list of names and information gathered over the course of campaign that the Trump effort has used to ""cultivate a universe of millions of fervent Trump supporters, many of them reached through Facebook."" ""By Election Day, the campaign expects to have captured 12 million to 14 million e-mail addresses and contact information (including credit card numbers) for 2.5 million small-dollar donors, who together will have ponied up almost $275 million,"" they write. More importantly, Trump will own this infrastructure. He can use it as he pleases. (The Republican National Committee feels otherwise.) Maybe, Green and Issenberg suggests, it becomes the basis for the rumored Trump TV network. But it could just as easily become the base for a sustained insurgency within the Republican Party, with Trump as its figurehead and people like Bannon as its strategists. This isn't an exaggeration. There is a massive gap between the Republican Party's leaders and its base. And a large portion of that base has tied its fortunes to Trump, marching behind his anti-trade, anti-immigration, and anti-Muslim rhetoric. They're his most passionate supporters, the voters who agree that the election is ""rigged"" and believe that Hillary Clinton is inherently illegitimate. They trust Trump above and beyond traditional Republican politicians. Indeed, they rejected those politicians in favor of Trump. There's a chance that this effort is an elaborate grift--a way for the real estate mogul to profit from his presidential run. But Trump has tarnished the Republican establishment. Through his outrageous rhetoric and behavior, he's shown the extent to which GOP leaders are hidebound and risk-averse, unwilling to challenge their nominee, even as he violates and tramples over the stated principles of their party. And he's shown Republican voters that there's another way, that they can satisfy their anger by rejecting that establishment in favor of figures like Trump, Bannon, and their allies. Once again, there is an opportunity for arbitrage, and Team Trump has all the tools it needs to exploit it and shape its campaign into a long-term voice for an explicitly prejudiced and ethno-nationalist version of the Republican Party. In this, Team Trump has an assist from the same Republicans he has diminished and marginalized. Unwilling to reform their agenda or their methods, traditional Republicans are preparing for a Hillary Clinton presidency by repurposing their strategy for the Obama presidency: constant, recalcitrant opposition and the same apocalyptic rhetoric that created an appetite for Trump's caustic approach. U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz is promising ""years"" of investigations for Clinton's prospective administration, and Sens. John McCain and Ted Cruz have preemptively rejected any Supreme Court nominations from a President Clinton. Embattled Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson preemptively suggested impeachment for Clinton, and it's clear--watching organs of Republican thought and opinion--that conservatives are gearing themselves up for a new nullification strategy. Once again, massive resistance will define the GOP's approach to a Democratic president, as mainstream Republicans all but treat a potential President Clinton as inherently illegitimate. Which is to say that Republicans are feeding the same anger that gave Trump the space to thrive, opening the door to either a recurrence of 2016, or a world in which a savvier operator can pick up where Trump left off. Again, it's important to understand that parties move toward their most energetic and organized voters. These are the people who elect the lawmakers and choose the officials who shape and direct policy. And in turn, those voters are influenced by forces outside of themselves, like media. In the Obama era, we saw Republicans respond to a hard-right movement of angry conservative voters--the Tea Party--which was influenced and inflamed by aggressive voices in right-wing media. Because of Trump, we may get that dynamic again, turned to 11. His campaign--and the swirl of outlets from Reddit to Breitbart to the potential Trump TV--is a new kind of perpetual rage machine that will keep the Trumpified base energized, aroused, and ready to force the GOP to cater to its whims. There are already politicians skating toward this puck. Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton recently took a four-day tour of Iowa, speaking to GOP groups and supporting local politicians. His message? A blend of traditional Republican rhetoric and Trumpism. ""Iowa, there's nothing normal about Bible-believing Christians being tarred as bigots because they simply want to live their faith in their day-to-day life,"" Cotton said. ""There's nothing normal about a country that won't secure its borders, but will admit a million immigrants a year--the population of Iowa added every three years, at a time when our country and too many of our fellow citizens are out of work or haven't had a pay raise in years."" By knocking down the taboo of explicit racism, Trump has brought a kind of white nationalism into the mainstream of American politics. Its mere presence makes it something to be appealed to and pandered to. The future of the Republican Party is still unwritten. But one thing is clear. Trump's ideological progeny--as well as his allies and prospective imitators--are the ones organizing. They have the energy. And while they may not win a battle to define the GOP, they have a head start. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Trump Can Happen Again
12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/black_voters_aren_t_turning_out_in_north_carolina_but_tim_kaine_is_on_the.html	"SANFORD, North Carolina--Democrats here have a problem. To win the state for Hillary Clinton and their statewide candidates--Roy Cooper for governor and Deborah Ross for Senate, in particular--they need high turnout from black voters, on par with what Barack Obama managed in 2008. Almost every black American who comes to the polls in North Carolina is a vote for the Democratic ticket. When you add black turnout to Clinton's performance among college-educated whites, you take the state off the board for Donald Trump, which puts the White House out of reach, too. But black voters aren't turning out the way they did in 2008--at least, they're not in early voting. They aren't even turning out the way they did in 2012, when Obama fell short of a majority in the state. Clinton still leads North Carolina, edging out Trump by an average of 3 points, but that's a little too close for comfort for her and the campaign. Which is why, for this final week before Election Day proper, her most prominent surrogates are making stops in the state, rallying supporters and urging them to vote early. On Monday, the surrogate was Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, Clinton's pick for vice president. The place was Sanford, a small city of nearly 30,000 people near the center of the state in Lee County. There's no particular draw for Sanford. The landscape of the South is dotted with places that look just like it, quiet settlements with historic downtowns, old cemeteries, and a cluster of big-box stores, fast-food joints, and auto-body shops. Why send Kaine to Sanford when Raleigh and Greensboro--two major metropolitan areas--are in the vicinity? Two things stand out. First, Sanford is around 30 percent black, and at the community college where Team Clinton held its event, those black residents were first in line to see the prospective vice president and rally with the campaign. ""I voted early for Hillary because I know she will be strong. She will bring us together,"" said Barbara Heck, who was among the first to arrive for Kaine's event. A lifelong resident of Sanford, she's enthusiastic for Clinton and she wants to stand against Trump. ""We already have racism and racists, but I think Trump will make things worse,"" she explained. Likewise, said Wanda Bronson, another longtime resident of Sanford, ""She's trying to unify the country, to better everyone. I don't understand why there is such hatred for her. It's sad."" That Sanford is substantially black leads to the second reason to send Kaine here: Lee County's early vote total lags behind where it was in 2012. Four years ago, the county cast more than 16,000 votes before Election Day. As of Monday, that number stands at just under 12,000. Kaine's visit, then, ties in to the larger problem: Democrats need more early voters than they have, and more black ones in particular. And in fact, Kaine's stump speech was tailored to a black audience, with a lengthy riff comparing Donald Trump's birtherism with the Supreme Court's infamous ruling in Dred Scott v. Sandford. ""We had to do it to show that African Americans are just as much citizens as everyone else,"" said Kaine, linking Dred Scott with the eventual Civil War over slavery. ""So when Donald Trump insists that Obama is not a citizen, you have to ask yourself why he wants to go back to that time."" With this line, Kaine was channeling the feelings of many in attendance, folks who see Trump bringing hate into the mainstream. ""Watching Trump is an experience,"" said Wayne Hooker, a retiree who moved back to Sanford after spending 20 years as a police officer in Washington. ""It makes you wonder, 'Can anyone really feel this way? Can anyone really say these things and get away with it?' "" Most of the people attending the rally in Sanford had already voted early--they wore stickers to that effect. It's unclear whether Kaine's appearance will make a meaningful difference. I suppose it could, if attendees are energized enough to push their friends and family to vote. But there's really only so much these efforts can accomplish. Step back from this activity on the ground, and it's clear that the single largest obstacle to increasing the Democratic early vote--especially among black voters--is the relentless push by Republicans to restrict and limit voting. North Carolina isn't the only place where black turnout is down; we see a similar pattern in Florida. In both states, Republicans made an aggressive effort to reduce early voting and raise new barriers to the polls. So far, it seems, it's working. Hillary Clinton is swimming upstream against Republican officials who have tried to tilt the playing field as far against her campaign as they can manage. Which is to say that this is what a ""rigged"" election looks like. Not unfavorable polls or criticism from the media, but an active effort to exclude one group of voters for narrow partisan gain.

13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/gop_voters_who_don_t_like_trump_reveal_their_votes.html	"In March, I spoke to 13 Republican voters who weren't fond of Donald Trump. In May, I spoke to them again. Now that we've reached the home stretch, I thought I'd check in one last time to see how these folks are feeling one week out, and if anything has changed. This was never a scientific undertaking--my sample size is tiny, found through my own social and professional networks. I just wanted a glimpse of the thought processes of longtime Republicans who were uncomfortable with Trump as their party's nominee. For this final edition, I invited my focus group to reveal who they'll vote for, and to tell me their best-case and worst-case scenarios coming out of this election. In terms of movement to or from the two major party candidates, Trump was the clear winner over this survey's timeframe. Two people have gone from being probable Hillary Clinton voters to casting their votes for Gary Johnson. And two have gone from not voting, or writing in a different candidate, to becoming firm Trump votes. Here are my panel's replies (their answers have been edited and condensed): Who: retired attorney, female, 52, California
Voting background: has always voted GOP in presidential elections but abstained in 2008
What she said she'd do in March if Trump became the nominee: probably not vote, possibly vote for Hillary
What she said in May: vote for Gary Johnson or not vote at all
What she says now: she's voting for Gary Johnson I am going to vote Johnson. Since I vote in California it doesn't really make a difference. Best- case scenario: Clinton gets a resounding win in both the Electoral College and the popular vote. Worst-case scenario: The popular vote goes Trump, the Electoral College goes to Clinton, and Trump encourages violent protests. I think that is worse than Trump winning because things could get quite ugly at a time when we'll need a new president to really tend to the office after all this silliness. * * * Who: stay-at-home parent, female, 31, Massachusetts
Voting background: has voted GOP in every previous presidential election
What she said she'd do in March if Trump became the nominee: vote for Hillary
What she said in May: vote for Hillary
What she says now: she's probably voting for Hillary I am so undecided. As a survivor of a sexual assault, Trump disgusts me to no end with his remarks and, undoubtedly, his actions. However, Hillary's view on abortion is the main reason I am struggling so much with this election. She doesn't seem just pro-choice, but almost pro-abortion. I have had three miscarriages that have only strengthened my view that life begins at conception. So these very different traumatic events in my life are now haunting me with both candidates. The best-case scenario would be for Trump to win and for him to say, ""Hey, this was fun, I'm gonna step down now and Mike Pence will be president."" The worst-case scenario would be for Trump to win and have the rest of the world first laugh at us, and then set Trump off, and then we end up with World War III. He's not rational and not fit to lead. I guess I am voting for Hillary because the murder and death she causes will be less likely to affect my child, while I truly am worried about increased terrorist attacks with Trump and his immature, smug inexperience. * * * Who: business owner and CEO, male, 44, Washington, D.C.
Voting background: has always voted GOP in presidential elections, save for a Libertarian vote in 2004
What he said he'd do in March if Trump became the nominee: pray
What he said in May: not vote
What he says now: he won't vote or he'll write in Mitt Romney These candidates remain badly damaged human beings and neither are worthy of my vote. Since I live in Washington, D.C., I have the luxury of not mattering, so I'll likely stay home. If I do go to vote, it will be because the race for our local ANC commissioner is close, in which case I'll write in Mitt Romney for president. Best-case scenario? Not sure there is one. Maybe Evan McMullin winning in Utah would be encouraging, in that at least one of our 50 states rejected this awful choice. A complete purging of the RNC leadership and the Trump enablers would also be a good outcome. Worst-case scenario? They all seem to be worst cases. I hope Trump loses by a wide enough margin that it makes clear just how big a loser he is and damages his influence going forward.  But that might mean Hillary would feel emboldened to double down on the crap that drives us all nuts--the inability to admit fault, and the tendency to insult our intelligence with the spin, distortion, and downright dishonesty. If she wins narrowly, she might be slightly chastised, but then the Trump idiots will carry on for four years about a rigged election and other nonsense. * * * Who: retired attorney, male, 74, California
Voting background: has voted GOP since Barry Goldwater, with one break for Ross Perot in 1992
What he said he'd do in March if Trump became the nominee: vote for Trump
What he said in May: vote for Trump
What he says now: he's voting for Trump I am sick about all of my choices and about our governance going forward. My biggest concern is the Supreme Court and I still don't trust HRC with that. It is that simple, and that painful, considering Trump's behavior. The list of judges he says he would nominate is solid. I have done some fairly serious research on them, and I am fine with the vast majority. None of that means I would be happy with Trump. My hope would be that he'd develop a team of advisers and be guided by them. But I have very little argument to show any certainty in that hope. * * * Who: civil litigation attorney, male, 45, California
Voting background: has always voted GOP in previous presidential elections
What he said he'd do in March if Trump became the nominee: probably vote for Trump
What he said in May: 80-90 percent sure he can't vote for Trump under any circumstances
What he says now: he's voting for Gary Johnson My final decision is to vote for Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson. In retrospect, Trump could have won me over had he at any point in the campaign started concentrating on issues and otherwise not acting like a complete jerk. But Trump has to be Trump. And I'm not buying what he is selling. I find that he lacks the character, ethics, judgment, and temperament to be president and, even more important, is likely to take the Republican Party and the country in a policy direction with which I disagree. * * * Who: stay-at-home parent, female, 38, Virginia
Voting background: has voted GOP in every presidential election
What she said she'd do in March if Trump became the nominee: write in a different candidate
What she said in May: write in someone or leave her ballot blank
What she says now: she's voting for Trump I can't believe I'm saying this but, as of now, I will be voting for Trump. I still find him to be a boorish pig. But as time has passed since the primaries, Hillary's corrupt actions that amount to criminal behavior--and the media's obvious (and now undeniable) collusion in covering them up--have moved me from not voting if he is the candidate to doing what I can to prevent her from getting elected. That includes plugging my nose and voting for Trump. It is clear that Trump will have many checks on his actions as president--from his fellow Republicans, the Democrats, and most of all the media. But Hillary not only thinks she's above the law, she's proven she pretty much is. Her staff, as well as the media, will go to great lengths to cover up her actions. She is a much greater risk to our civil liberties than he is. I may not fully trust he will execute a conservative agenda, but I know without a doubt she will carry out her extreme liberal agenda. I have no choice but to hope and pray he will come through and protect the things I hold most dear, because I know she will destroy them. * * * Who: retired executive, male, 75, New Jersey
Voting background: has always voted GOP in previous presidential elections
What he said he'd do in March if Trump became the nominee: vote for Hillary
What he said in May: vote for Hillary
What he says now: he's voting for Hillary My resolution to cast my first ever non-Republican presidential vote remains solid. Driven by growing disgust for Trump's candidacy (what he says, what he doesn't say, and what he stands for) during the time since last we spoke, I am ready for Nov. 8 and will live with any discomfort I might have with the Democratic candidate. The lack of guts on the part of Republican leaders to repudiate Trump from the start of the primary to now has left the party in ragged shape and confirms my belief that drastic change is needed. So, the best-case scenario for me is a stunning Democratic victory from the presidential level on down the ballot. From this disaster, the Republican Party just might realize that the country has changed-demographically and philosophically-and start to restructure from within so that candidates that I can vote for are presented. I have two worst-case scenarios:"	"""Plugging My Nose and Voting for Trump"""
14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/approval_voting_is_better_than_plurality_voting_america.html	"When the networks call it for Hillary Clinton on election evening I'll bask in relief for six seconds or so. Then I'll shift to raw anger: How could a major party grant a guy like Donald Trump a puncher's chance at the presidency? This fiasco of an outcome--landing Trump one step from the White House--might have been avoided with a simple change to the GOP's nomination process. Don't blame Trump's ascent on economic anxiety, or racism, or the media. Blame it on the way we hold elections. Though he was beloved by a certain swath of voters, the fact is Trump left most Republicans cold. He won a smaller percentage of GOP primary votes than any of the party's three previous champions. He holds the record as the GOP nominee with the most votes cast against him. Trump succeeded, especially early on, by commanding small pluralities within a very large field. There was a desperate thirst for a more traditional nominee, but the ""establishment lane"" candidates ate into each other's support, divvying up the pool of votes from the sane folks who were disgusted by Trump. Realizing this, some attempted to game the system and rally around a not-Trump candidate. Recall, for instance, Mitt Romney's Super Tuesday directive urging Ohioans to vote for John Kasich and Floridians to vote for Marco Rubio, thereby keeping those states out of Trump's hands. These trick-shot hijinks failed, in part because voters were loath to cast their precious votes for a candidate who wasn't their actual top choice. In this context, Trump's victory over a squabbling field of blander opponents can be viewed less as an indictment of GOP voters and more as an indictment of our stupid voting system. Consider: Why were those primary voters forced to choose only one candidate from the overflowing platter of 16 or so GOP hopefuls? Why not make it a buffet? A ballot that insists you choose just one option doesn't let you convey much information about your feelings and intentions. Your vote for Ted Cruz in the New Hampshire primary might have meant that you adored Ted Cruz; or it might have meant you could barely stand Cruz but you thought he was the guy with the best chance to derail the horrifying Trump Train. Similarly, your vote for Ralph Nader in the 2000 general election might have meant you thought Ralph Nader could legit win the White House; or it might have meant you were super jazzed to send a message about your progressive ideals, but, of course, when it got down to it you knew Al Gore would be a better president than George W. Bush and whoops, your bad, so sorry for the Iraq war. Given the wide range of things a vote can mean, shouldn't we find a better way to let people signal what they actually intend on their ballots? In his excellent 2008 book Gaming the Vote, author William Poundstone explored the problems with our current voting system. ""The plurality vote we use in America is mathematically the absolute worst way to vote,"" Poundstone told me by phone when I spoke to him recently. Why? For one thing, Poundstone estimates that roughly 1 in 10 of our presidential elections has been swung by a ""spoiler"" candidate who alters the outcome. The example that lingers in recent memory is that 2000 campaign, in which Nader siphoned votes from Gore and very likely threw the election to Bush. But it's happened many times before--in 1848, 1884, and 1912, to name a few. Allowing the second-most-popular candidate to win a three-way race is a ""catastrophic error,"" in Poundstone's view. And it could easily be prevented by switching to a different voting system. Let's say we switched from plurality voting to ""approval voting""--in which you check the box next to every candidate you approve of (or, if your glass is half empty, every candidate you can tolerate). A left-leaning general election voter in 2000 might have checked both Nader and Gore, and left Bush's box blank. This would express approval of Nader's agenda, and help lift his party's profile in the final tally, but would still help Gore (the far more electable candidate) win his battle with Bush. Approval voting is particularly useful when a large field of candidates includes some ""clones."" Clone candidates--competitors who aren't sharply differentiated--often split votes and harm each other, even though they seek to advance similar viewpoints. Let's imagine the GOP had used approval voting: Instead of agonizing over whether Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, or John Kasich was the best mainstream candidate to foil Trump and push the establishment agenda, a GOP voter could have checked the boxes next to all three. No need to game the system, coordinate a strategy with other citizens, or refrain from voting for the candidate you actually favor. And it just so happens that consolidating those three candidates' votes would have beat Trump in each of the first three GOP contests. It's impossible to know for sure how things might have unfolded under a different system. For instance, some Ben Carson voters might have also checked Trump. Then again, some Cruz voters might have also checked Rubio. What we can be certain of is that we'd have avoided the vote-splitting problem, and that we'd have gotten a clearer picture of primary voters' intentions. (In case you're wondering, approving every candidate on the ballot is the same as not voting at all. But checking every one of the other 15 candidates while not checking Trump would still make a difference to the relative count.) This year's general election might also have offered a chance for approval voting to shine. Do you wish the Libertarian Party had a bigger voice in our politics, but are you afraid your vote for Gary Johnson would help elect Trump? Vote for Johnson and Clinton, problem solved. Are you a millennial who sweats Jill Stein because you're hella woke but don't want your parents to blame you for a potential Trumpocalypse? Bro, just vote for Stein and Hillary. For those who feel stifled by our manichaean two-party system, approval voting is an ideal change--almost certainly catalyzing more third party activity and attention, as you're no longer ""throwing away your vote"" by throwing a bone to a quixotic choice. This wouldn't be a burdensome switch. Approval voting wouldn't require us to design new voting machines or new ballots--the current ones could handle it, according to approval voting advocates. It's also very easy to explain the approval concept to the public. You get it already, right? There are other alternatives that would also be better than plurality voting. There's ranked voting (order the candidates in terms of your preference) and range voting (give each candidate some number of points out of a possible total, like you're doing a Yelp review), and infinite variations therein. Elsewhere in Slate, Evelyn Lamb demonstrates that there are empirical flaws with each of these alternatives, but the key fact remains: All are superior to the system we use right now. So why are we stuck with a bad system? A lot of smart people are thinking about better ways to vote. You can go down a deep rabbit hole where terms like ""Condorcet cycle"" and ""Borda count"" get tossed around with ease, warring factions debate which voting method is best, and Nobel Prizes are won for doing the math. But primaries are controlled by the parties, and elected politicians have little motivation to change the structure that got them elected. When Reince Priebus goes to the autopsy board on Nov. 9, with his party in disarray and his job on the line, he might consider changing more than just the GOP platform. He can't choose his voters, but he can choose the way they vote. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Don't Blame Voters for the Rise of Trump. Blame the Stupid Way We Vote.
15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/what_donald_trump_might_do_with_the_powers_of_the_presidency.html	As I go to bed early Wednesday morning, I understand that my relationship to my government has changed. There have been presidents I didn't like, even from my own party. There have been presidents who have made momentous decisions that I considered reckless. But I always believed that those presidents broadly understood the contours of the American system and the American ideal in the same way that I did, roughly the way our founders sketched it out. I always respected their authority and considered them my president. Donald Trump is not my president. When Trump began his campaign, he had no clear view of the world. He believed in the religion of entertainment and the pleasures of gamesmanship. His desperate craving for adulation, the motivating force in his biography, seemed to provide him passing relief from an aching case of neediness. The character, ripped from reality television, who began the campaign was buffoonish and demagogic. His despicable characterizations of Mexicans and his blazing criticism of the Chinese were coupled with a long, improvised record of ideological transgressions and a tendency to gravitate toward the political positions that best suited his immediate self-interest. Over the course of this campaign, the man who will serve as our president--I choke on the words--abandoned that cartoonish persona. He morphed into a darker, more resentful figure. All the personal slights--from his fellow Republicans, from the media--radicalized him. It made him more prone toward embracing a nastier view of the world. It never made sense that a kid from Queens, who wanted nothing more than to succeed in Manhattan, would gravitate to the anti-globalist, net-Confederate fringe. Yet, that's what happened. Blood-and-soil nationalism were present from the start of his campaign, even if he didn't exactly understand the thrust of his rhetoric. But his words attracted the far right, which considered him its best ever vehicle for mainstreaming its vile ideals. And because of his deep insecurities, he embraced the people who loved him most. The Donald Trump who emerged from this campaign subscribes to an ideology far more radical than anything we've seen in recent American history. There was a reason he signed up Steve Bannon to be his campaign guru--a man who believes in aligning the Republican Party with the far right parties of the world. This embrace of the European style of ethnocentric nationalism is alien to American conservatism, even if conservatives here have often practiced a racist politics. Ronald Reagan and the two Bushes at least genuflected in the direction of cosmopolitanism and to the idea of progress. They did so with genuine conviction even, and they rejected the Hobbesian counter-enlightenment beliefs that carried Europe toward Mussolini and Hitler. So now we have a president-elect with authoritarian tendencies assuming a presidency that has never been more powerful. Over the course of the past 20 years, we have invested ever more authority in the executive branch of government--we have given presidents the power to launch war without congressional consent, and we have given them the power to rewrite the crucial details of domestic policy without any legislative stamp of approval. We rarely worried about investing the presidency with such latitude. It seemed a rational response to legislative gridlock, the only way to keep the country moving. And it seemed reasonable to believe that the considerable power of the presidency would be wielded by a person who respected the Constitution and the norms of American government. Perhaps, I'm not being blunt enough: Donald Trump is an authoritarian assuming the office of the presidency at the peak of its imperial powers, unhindered by the drag of divided government. The people have spoken--and the people have set in motion a path that threatens our republic, at least as we know it. They have chosen to take the country in the direction of illiberal democracy. They have selected a leader who hates the First Amendment, who has shown a proclivity for imposing religious and ethnic tests on the citizenry, a leader who has benefited from an enemy power's intervention in our democratic process. Donald Trump is not my president, and perhaps he's not yours, but he will have more power over us--and the inclination to use it--than any president in American history.

16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/is_this_the_election_hillary_clinton_wanted.html	"PHILADELPHIA--It's not easy to follow Barack Obama. It's not easy to follow Michelle Obama. It's not easy to follow Bill Clinton, or Bruce Springsteen, or Jon Bon Jovi. (That last part was a joke--it's not too hard to follow Jon Bon Jovi.) But that was what Hillary Clinton had to do on Monday night in Philadelphia before the tens of thousands of supporters on Independence Mall who showed up for what was originally billed as Clinton's final rally of the campaign, before the campaign slapped on a midnight Raleigh, North Carolina, event. It was a night of public personalities whose crowd-pleasing abilities dwarfed her own, a final burst of star wattage. Was this the campaign Hillary Clinton wanted? On net, sure. Hillary Clinton is driven to win, and by drawing as her opponent Donald Trump, the worst presidential nominee in forever, she's positioned to do so Tuesday, barring a comprehensive national polling error. Being a near-lock for office from the second your opponent clinches his nomination is a pretty great thing. But Trump was never about issues; he was about Trump, and he pulls everything with which he comes into contact--New York real estate, Atlantic City, NBC's prime-time lineup, and now a presidential campaign--into a luridly unfolding story about himself. That made the campaign a matter of personalities: never her most comfortable suit and, unfortunately for civic life, his favorite one. The star power of Trump's campaign is centralized with the candidate; with Clinton it's dispersed to surrogates. As the Clinton campaign announced that first 20,000, then 30,000, then perhaps a 40,000 people were showing up for the Independence Mall rally Monday night, Trump supporters and other Clinton skeptics joked that what those people showed up for was a free Bon Jovi and Bruce Springsteen concert. It wasn't much of a ""concert."" The brief performances made a third-hour Today street set look like Woodstock. It's unclear what it was about the atmosphere of a political rally designed to excite the Keystone State's blue metropolis that compelled Bon Jovi and Springsteen to perform somnolent, almost funereal versions of songs like ""Livin' on a Prayer"" and ""Dancing in the Dark."" It's also unclear if these performances worked as well on the crowd as they did on the middle-age male journalists assembled in the press section, who rushed to the nearest metal gates upon hearing the Boss' first plucked acoustic string. The crowd certainly liked Michelle Obama, whom an unusually short-winded Bill Clinton accurately introduced as ""the finest surrogate, supporter that any candidate has ever had."" Both Michelle and Barack Obama didn't want to steal the scene from nominee. That's hard, since they're Michelle and Barack Obama. Michelle Obama thanked the crowd for the ""privilege of serving as your first family,"" and added that ""we believe our responsibility to you does not end when we leave the White House."" Their legacy and everything they care about is on the line--or, to put it bluntly, the Obama years will look a whole lot worse in the history books if the immediate reaction to it is the Donald Trump administration. You'd better believe they're out in Philadelphia the night before the election telling people to vote--and in Michelle's case, scolding anyone who dares consider a protest vote. It was, as I say, a hard act for Hillary Clinton to follow. The same old bad lines were there, somehow. She is still, on the eve of the election, using the ""Deal. Me. In"" line. The slogan ""Love Trumps Hate,"" which couples fuzzy liberal glibness with a tiresome pun, is still in circulation. When she moves past slogans, though, and tries to flesh out a point, she can have something. She had something when she began to speak of Khizr Khan, who introduced her in New Hampshire the previous night. She retold the well-told story of Khan's son, who was killed in Iraq. ""And what Mr. Khan said last night is something I want us all to remember. He said after the many derogatory and insulting comments that we've heard from Donald Trump: Would his son, Captain Khan, have a place in Donald Trump's America? That's an important question for all of us."" There were no hammy speech inflections here. She delivered it in a near whisper. It's a question that you could tell she took seriously. And it's a question she knew she wouldn't be asking on the election eve if she weren't running against Donald Trump. He has been abysmal, and she can thank him for putting her in the White House if she wins. But there have been consequences. Donald Trump's America isn't going anywhere, win or lose.

18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/how_trump_son_in_law_jared_kushner_ruined_the_new_york_observer.html	"Jared Kushner wasn't yet married to Ivanka Trump, or trying to help elect her father president, when he bought the New York Observer in 2006. At the beginning, the 25-year-old could only do so much damage: The editors who ran the paper were too good, both at editing stories and at pushing back against the new owner's short-sighted demands. From my desk in the newsroom--I started at the Observer right out of college in 2007--it was easy to see Kushner as a dim but mostly harmless rich kid whose willingness to spend money on the paper was the only thing keeping it alive. A decade later, as an older and more mature Kushner prepares for the end of a presidential campaign that ought to define him as long as he lives, I find myself wishing he had kept his money, or at least properly killed the Observer off instead of tainting its name with his own. There have been a number of Kushner profiles since he became intimately involved with Donald Trump's campaign. They have mostly described him as unassuming and generically pleasant, with the caveat that sometimes, in private, he screams at people in anger and seeks revenge when he feels he has been wronged. Despite those traits, I was skeptical when I read in April that Kushner was starting to play an important role in Trump's campaign. It wasn't because I thought it was beneath him--more that I couldn't imagine what he could possibly bring to the table. Trump's pitch, after all, relied on reckless pugnacity, which Kushner didn't seem to have, and the stoking of racial and economic resentments, which I didn't think he could identify with. It was only when the prospect of a Trump presidency started to seem real--when I pictured Trump and his family moving into the White House--that I understood Kushner's involvement for what it was: the opportunistic gamble of a crow pursuing the shiniest object in sight. It started, if the reporting was correct, with Kushner advising Trump on a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and continued with putting together his transition team; testifying to his tolerance of Jews; and ultimately becoming, in the words of the New York Times, a ""de-facto campaign manager."" Most recently, the Times reported that Kushner was lending his ""soothing, whispery voice"" to the effort of keeping Trump focused and calm during the final days of the campaign. Throughout all this, Kushner has succeeded in keeping a low profile, providing next to nothing in the way of clues to his thought process and wearing the blank expression of a Ken doll in public. The most penetrating observation about Kushner that I've read this election cycle appeared in a recent Tablet piece that sought, among other things, to make sense of Kushner's feelings for the Observer as it existed under its longtime editor, Peter Kaplan. After he bought the paper, writes Chris Pomorski,"	Jared Kushner Made a Great New York Paper Complicit in the Trump Campaign
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/the_majority_of_trump_supporters_surveyed_described_black_people_as_less.html	"Donald Trump has been charged with racism throughout much of his career and much of his campaign. As researchers who investigate racial attitudes and their relationship to politics, we have been investigating the idea that there are whites in the U.S. who believe that black people are not as evolved as white people. In other words, the dehumanization of blacks. As we watched the rise of Trump, we wondered if the people who held this belief were also more likely to support the Republican nominee. Our research indicates that many whites see blacks as less human than they see members of their own racial group. More than one-third of whites we surveyed rate black people as ""less evolved"" than they rate whites. Furthermore, substantial proportions of white respondents say that the terms ""savage,"" ""barbaric,"" and ""lacking self-restraint, like animals"" describe black people well. Those who hold these dehumanizing views of black people are disproportionately likely to support Donald Trump. This idea--which to be clear is absolutely false--was once erroneously supported by science. It was not all that long ago that leading researchers claimed that black people were less evolved than white people and closer to humanity's apelike ancestors on the evolutionary scale. We suspected, however, that more people still possess some of these beliefs than is generally thought. To assess the extent to which the general public subscribes to these claims in the present day, two of us (Jardina and Piston) conducted a survey of a nationally representative sample of 2,000 non-Hispanic white U.S. adult citizens. The survey (which employed a method developed by Kellogg School of Management professor Nour Kteily and colleagues) was administered over the internet and contracted through the firm GfK, whose address-based sampling approach is the gold standard in online survey research.* Subjects viewed a graphical depiction of ""The Ascent of Man,"" in which various silhouettes along a scale reflect popular perceptions of the evolution of humans from ape to fully upright man. The graph begins on the left end of the scale with a crouching ancestor reminiscent of an ape, moves in the middle of the scale to a Cro-Magnon type holding a spear, and concludes on the right end of the scale with a fully upright modern human. Next, subjects were asked how evolved they believe blacks and whites to be on this 0-100 scale. In this nationally representative sample, a full 38 percent of white subjects rated blacks as less evolved than they rated whites. Because this finding was so surprising, we conducted a separate survey on Mechanical Turk in which we asked the identical ""Ascent of Man"" question to our subjects and then, immediately afterward, asked them what they had been thinking about when deciding how to respond to this question. White respondents routinely described black people in dehumanizing ways. Some examples: ""I consider blacks to be closer to the animal kingdom,"" one respondent said, because blacks ""lack the intelligence and morals"" of other races. Another said that black people ""carry and conduct themselves"" in ways that are ""almost animalistic."" A third responded claimed that black people have ""the highest rate of murders"" and cited this as evidence for the assertion that blacks are ""people who act like animals."" These results are not limited to groups of whites that are often stereotyped as racially prejudiced. For instance, 33 percent of white Democrats and 34 percent of high-income whites rated black people as less evolved than white people, compared with 39 percent of white Republicans and 41 percent of low-income whites. Dehumanizing views are pervasive across white social groups. That said, there is one group of whites that stands out in the degree to which it holds dehumanizing views of black people: Trump supporters. To measure evaluations of Trump, we asked our subjects to describe how warm they feel toward Trump on a 0-100 scale. Here we compare Trump's strongest opponents (defined here as those who rate Trump at a 25 or below) to Trump's strongest supporters (those who rate Trump higher than 75). Twenty-eight percent of white Trump opponents rate blacks as less evolved than they rate whites. In contrast, a majority of Trump supporters--52 percent--rate blacks as less evolved than whites. We detected substantial levels of dehumanization among Trump supporters through additional survey questions as well. For example, 27 percent of Trump supporters said the phrase ""lacking self-restraint, like animals"" describes black people well, compared with 8 percent of Trump opponents. Trump supporters were also substantially more likely than Trump opponents to say that the terms ""savage"" and ""barbaric"" describe black people well. Of course, these findings are not the first to reveal connections between racial attitudes and support for Trump. But previous surveys have measured more subtle (though still important) forms of prejudice, such as negative stereotypes about black people or resentment toward black people. Our work captures something more fundamental: the denial that blacks fully count as people in the first place. Critically, surveys we conducted earlier in the Republican primary reveal that dehumanization of blacks is not strongly associated with support for other Republican candidates such as Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. Of course, Trump's rhetoric on racial issues is much different from that of the other Republican candidates in the field. Trump has also been slow to distance himself from white supremacists such as David Duke of the Ku Klux Klan. He has tweeted and retweeted memes from white supremacist Twitter accounts as well and repeated the falsehood that most white homicide victims are killed by black people. Trump has praised violence against black protesters at his rallies and even suggested that he might participate in it himself. It is no surprise, then, that whites who see black people as less than fully human are disproportionately likely to support Trump. Many political pundits appear bewildered that a candidate as overtly racist as Trump could have so much success on the presidential campaign trail. But for those whites who deny the full humanity of blacks, Trump may be popular not despite his racism but because of it. *Correction, Nov. 11, 2016: This article originally misidentified Nour Kteily as a professor at Northwestern.

20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/trump_s_campaign_ends_as_it_began_with_bigotry_and_xenophobia.html	"Donald Trump announced his campaign with a broadside against Hispanic immigrants. ""They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people,"" he said. Soon after, he added Muslims to his roster of threats. By the time he'd captured the Republican presidential nomination, Trump's platform was clear: He would bring state power to bear against unauthorized immigrants, Muslim Americans, Syrian refugees, and black protesters. We are hours from the end of the campaign, and Trump is ending it the way he started: demonizing immigrants, nonwhites, and religious minorities, and blaming them for America's problems. The first swing came on Saturday, when Trump released the closing ad of his campaign. ""The establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election,"" warns Trump in the video, which quotes from an address he gave last month in West Palm Beach, Florida. ""For those who control the levers of power in Washington and for the global special interests, they partner with these people that don't have your good in mind."" Trump's speech in Florida was roundly condemned as anti-Semitic for its use of anti-Jewish tropes. With his latest ad, Trump leaned into those tropes, interspersing this slam on ""global special interests"" with photos of George Soros, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, and Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, all Jewish. The message is clear--Jewish elites threaten American sovereignty--and blatantly anti-Semitic, with a lineage that includes Henry Ford's The International Jew and the even more infamous The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Not content to end his campaign by just indulging the ur-prejudice of the Western world, Donald Trump made a Sunday campaign stop in Minnesota to spread a different message of xenophobia and hate. ""She wants virtually unlimited immigration and refugee admissions, from the most dangerous regions of the world, to come into our country and to come into Minnesota, and you know it better than anybody,"" Trump said, referring to Clinton. ""Her plan will import generations of terrorism, extremism, and radicalism into your schools and throughout your community. You already have it.""* Trump's last line was a reference to Minnesota's substantial Somali population, which includes many refugees. ""Here in Minnesota,"" he said, ""you've seen firsthand the problems caused with faulty refugee vetting, with large numbers of Somali refugees coming into your state with your knowledge, without your support or approval. ... And with some of them then joining ISIS and spreading their extremist views all over our country and all over the world. ""You've suffered enough in Minnesota,"" Trump said, promising to block further refugees. The problem with Trump's rhetoric--the problem with almost all of his rhetoric--is that this isn't true. The United States has strict procedures for vetting refugees, with a process that can last up to two years. As for Somali Americans, the vast majority are ordinary, law-abiding citizens and residents. While there is a problem with radicalization among some younger members of the community, they represent a distinct minority. And joint efforts between local groups and the federal government have had some success in combating the factors that foster extremism. Trump undermines those efforts with his message of fear and hostility. Worse, he stokes the kind of atmosphere that turns refugees into targets for domestic terrorists, such as the three men in Garden City, Kansas, who were recently arrested for an alleged plot to bomb an apartment complex with a number of Somali American residents. As if to emphasize this closing message of prejudice and xenophobia, the Republican presidential nominee also announced a campaign stop in Michigan with Ted Nugent, a musician and right-wing political activist known for extremist positions and violent, racist rhetoric. Earlier this year, Nugent said that President Obama and Hillary Clinton should be ""tried for treason and hung"" for the deaths in Benghazi, Libya. ""You can't vote for liars,"" said the musician while stumping for Trump on Sunday. ""You can't vote for scam artists. You can't vote for people who take from producers and give it to the blood-suckers anymore."" Trump kicked off his political career with birtherism. He inaugurated his presidential campaign with xenophobia. He grew his base with the promise of a ban on Muslims and a wall with Mexico. Yes, he brought a kind of free-form economic populism to the Republican Party. But his passion has always been this vision of a whites-only America, defined in opposition to racial enemies. Now, with the end of the campaign in sight, his promise is simple. If elected, he will redeem the country from the illegitimate presidency of Barack Obama and restore the pride and dominance of white Americans. He will punish his opponents--Lock her up!--and protect American ""sovereignty"" from ""globalists."" This is the message that defeated his opponents in the Republican primary. This is the message that brings the crowds and the adoration. This is the message that will define his presidency. Donald Trump's closing tour is an affirmation of his entire political movement. It is churlish; it is misogynist; it is racist. And thanks to our partisanship and our polarization, he and his movement are just a stone's throw from the White House. *Correction, Nov. 7, 2016: This post originally misquoted Trump as saying Clinton's plan ""will important generations of terrorism, extremism, and radicalism."" He said that it will ""import"" those issues. (Return.) Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	The Trump Campaign Is Ending as It Began: Bigoted as Hell
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/11/the_2016_election_was_about_the_issues.html	"""When this election is finally over,"" New York Times columnist Paul Krugman tweeted recently, ""I'm planning to celebrate with an orgy of ... serious policy discussion. Won't it be great?"" Now, Krugman is not at all a creature of the Beltway consensus, and neither is he possessed of the terminal seriousness that afflicts so many of its communicants. But here he was sounding the great gasbag lament of 2016: This election hasn't been about the issues. You heard this a lot during the debates between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. ""All eyes were not on the issues,"" the Brookings Institution moaned after the second debate, and after the third, FiveThirtyEight rejoiced when for a moment ""the issues returned to center stage."" You heard versions of this, too, from partisans and hacks. ""You are fascinated with sex,"" Newt Gingrich (!) told Megyn Kelly, ""and you don't care about public policy."" In August, Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, whined, ""Hillary Clinton gave an entire speech this week about name-calling, not about the issues."" In September, Clinton's campaign manager, Robbie Mook, sighed, ""It's just sad that we can't have an actual discussion about the issues because Donald Trump doesn't have a command of the issues."" The issues. These are conjuring words, deployed to summon an air of adult purpose. In public discourse they tend to be pronounced with an unctuous reverence, in the same way you might say ""the children"" or ""the national debt"" or ""the Yankees."" Do not be taken in. This election was about the issues. I don't mean the phony ones that get bruited by the likes of Paul Volcker and Peter Peterson, both of whom could recently be found mewling in the pages of the New York Times about the deficit, a matter so fake and remote from the actual life of the country that the Times might as well have inveighed against chemtrails or published a dispatch from Glocca Morra. I'm talking about issues that involve the fundamental arrangements of American life, issues of race and class and gender and sexual violence. These are the things we've argued about in the past year and change, sometimes coarsely, sometimes tediously, but very often illuminatingly. This has been, by all but the most fatuous measures, an issue-rich campaign. Pick any matter of consequence, and chances are it was aired at length during the presidential campaign. (Well, almost any. Climate change got stiffed after the primaries.) Just a month ago, we had the vice presidential candidates debate urban policing, stop-and-frisk, and the concept of implicit racial bias, though perhaps debate is too strong a word. In truth it wasn't so much a debate as it was one guy acknowledging the existence of implicit bias and the other guy looking around the room for a hole to dive into. ""But, senator, please,"" Mike Pence said to his Democratic counterpart, Tim Kaine, ""enough of this seeking every opportunity to demean law enforcement broadly by making the accusation of implicit bias every time tragedy occurs."" Pence's answer might've been the thinnest possible slice of the very whitest bread, but it occasioned a conversation over the following days about submerged and structural biases and how they shape inequality. ""I want white people to recognize that there is systemic racism,"" Clinton said at a Democratic primary debate in April, and even by that point she was only offering up a commonplace. Race was the home chord of 2016, in part because Trump's campaign was from the start an instrument of racial reaction and xenophobia, and in part because the Democratic party, blacker and browner now, could at last talk about race as a central force in American life, not as a matter on which white people needed to be put at ease. Clinton spoke of mass incarceration and criminal justice in her first campaign speech, in June 2015, and over the course of the primaries her and her husband's inglorious legacies on these counts--""superpredators,"" the execution of Ricky Ray Rector, the federal crime bill of 1994--were the subjects of constant, meaningful disputation. Meanwhile, in the first presidential debate, Clinton took care to exhume Trump's history of housing discrimination before connecting it to more memorable moments of his oafish racism, including his relentless birtherism and his treatment of a former Miss Universe named Alicia Machado. ""But, remember,"" she said. ""Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. ... So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior."" (Trump certainly didn't do much to hide his racist fantasies. ""You're living in poverty. Your schools are no good. You have no jobs,"" he said, relating his Death Wish vision of black life in inner cities. ""Fifty-eight percent of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?"") Because of the nature of Trump's appeal and because of the Bernie Sanders insurgency--which struck all the vital themes the John Edwards campaign did in 2008 but with all the huckleberry and horndog stripped away--these questions of race were inextricably bound up with questions of class. Lord knows how many spotted-owl habitats were pulped for the sake of lord-knows-how-many presumptuously empathic, tender, longform portraits of the white working class. But the blind spots in the genre's analysis--principally a failure to appreciate the entwinement of racial resentment and economic self-interest--told a story on their own. They were of a piece with the broader initial failure among politicos to see the arbitrage play on which Trump's candidacy was premised: Having grown estranged from the party's establishment and its strain of Chamber of Commerce conservatism, the voters in the Republican base were primed for a candidate making apocalyptic promises about restoring their status relative to the nonwhites who seem ever to be gaining on them. And while its class determinism was too often overstated, the Sanders campaign suffered from a similar lacuna, overrating its appeal to poor whites and to black voters in general. Class was the backdrop for the attacks on free trade from both the left and from whatever political dimension Trump occupies. Clinton, very much a product of a 1990s-era neoliberalism, has been forced into violent contortions over her position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. Trump's assault on trade and NAFTA in particular was paranoid and incoherent where Sanders' was forensic, but together they amounted to a noisy and welcome critique of trade deals as the sum of a series of deliberate choices on which various groups of elites exert their considerable leverage--a rigged midway-carny game in which the winners (the American doctors and lawyers protected from international competition) and losers (the manufacturing workers exposed to competition from cheap labor just over the border) are pre-determined. The election posed an explicit challenge to the old, misguided faith in free trade and the natural wonders of the market. At least as a matter of national politics, NAFTA today is a set of bones bleaching in the Chihuahuan Desert sun. Owing to the presence of a Clinton at the top of the ticket, a great deal of the election was given over to an interrogation of the liberal assumptions formed during the 1990s, a decade the Democrats spent in a defensive crouch. On foreign policy, Clinton's redbaiting of Sanders never found an audience, and every time Henry Kissinger's support was adduced to an argument about Clinton's foreign policy bona fides, another young lefty learned the lyrics to ""The Internationale."" Clinton was hit repeatedly on her handling of Libya, first in the primary and later in the general election, revealing the extent to which a significant portion of the party and the country at large had left behind her discredited brand of adventurism abroad. Everyone remembers Khizr Khan, the Pakistani American father of a soldier slain in Iraq, waving his pocket Constitution at Trump from the podium of the Democratic National Convention. Don't forget that moments later, the party sent out onto the stage a bellowing crewcut named John Allen, whose speech invoking the ""forces of hatred, the forces of chaos and darkness"" was exactly the sort of exhortative chest-pounding that landed Khan's son in Iraq. He was interrupted repeatedly by chants of ""No More War."" This was a real fight over the issues, in this case issues literally of life and death, unfolding in primetime on national television on the final day of a political party's convention. But this is not the kind of airing of the issues that Serious People want. They're thinking of op-eds and green rooms and Meet the Press and the whole Dance of the Seven Veils whereby serious types perform seriousness to inveigle the deeply unserious likes of Cokie Roberts and Mark Halperin, for whom the issues are nothing more than a means of brand positioning. For Serious People, the manner in which the issues are raised is as important as the issues themselves. Abstractions are preferable, which is why ""abortion"" is an admissible issue but ""grab them by the pussy""--a vivid manifestation of the misogyny that runs beneath the surface of the abortion debate--is part of some queasy-making burlesque. ""Insults, invective, and pandering have been poor substitutes for serious debate about the direction in which this country is going--or should be going,"" Volcker and Peterson said in the Times, clearing their throats before delivering the standard austerity smut about entitlement reform--this at a time of soft demand and low interest rates--with a Trumpish grace note or two thrown in about ""foreign investors."" Volcker and Peterson were writing in October while all around them serious debates were being had about everything from Trump's tax avoidance to sexual assault. The month had begun with the leak of Trump's 1995 tax records to the New York Times. A few days earlier, when Clinton had said in the first presidential debate that Trump hadn't paid federal income tax, he'd interjected, ""That makes me smart."" These records added shading to that soundbite, providing a clearer picture of the mechanism by which Trump had not only cosseted himself from any consequences of the financial wreckage he'd left behind, but had personally profited from it. We already knew that Trump had shoved personal debt onto the balance sheet of a publicly traded company, Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts Inc., tanking the value of its stock while paying himself a multimillion-dollar salary. The records published by the Times showed that the losses he claimed in 1995, nearly a billion dollars, were substantial enough to cancel out taxable income for up to 18 years. He'd exempted himself from his failures by offloading them onto ordinary investors, and he'd exempted himself from his debt to the commonwealth. What issue could speak more directly to all the card palming and bottom dealing of the American elite? Days later, the Washington Post published the Access Hollywood tape, and in the weeks that followed, woman after woman came forward to tell stories of Trump's sexual aggression, every account seeming to corroborate Trump's own boasting. ""Grab them by the pussy,"" he'd said in that tape. ""He was like an octopus,"" Jessica Leeds told the New York Times. ""His hands were everywhere."" ""[H]e was pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat,"" reporter Natasha Stoynoff wrote in a first-person account published in People. ""He pushed me up against the wall, and had his hands all over me and tried to get up my dress again,"" Jill Harth told the Guardian in July. A candidacy launched with the promise of committing violence against the less powerful was now coming undone over allegations that the candidate himself had committed actual violence against the less powerful. That so much of this has been dismissed as tabloid folderol is a measure, as surely as the Trump phenomenon is, of the alienation of our political class from the America it means to lead. In one survey of teenage girls, per the New York Times, 42 percent said Trump ""had affected the way they thought about their bodies."" This campaign has not been an abstraction unfolding on some theoretical level. It's a political fight being waged along intimate psychic terrain, every outrage circling the same theme: power. Not just the power of the presidency, but the distributions and arrangements and perquisites of power in everyday American life, about who has the stuff and who doesn't, and about how the people who have it are permitted to treat the people who don't. The one favor Trump did us was to be monstrous about the things in America that matter the most, to force a confrontation with all the stuff our politics typically is at pains to suppress. This campaign was about power, and it was about impunity. It was about ""Grab them by the pussy,"" and it was about the sentence Donald Trump spoke just before that, the issue at the heart of the election: ""You can do anything.""

22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/can_tennessee_s_trey_hollingsworth_buy_a_congressional_seat_in_indiana.html	"Last September, Joseph Albert Hollingsworth III, better known as Trey, registered to vote in Jeffersonville, Indiana. He had moved from South Carolina, though he is by birth and most any other measure a Tennessean. By October Hollingsworth was running for Congress in the Indiana 9th, a mostly rural (and safely Republican) district that stretches between Indianapolis and Louisville. Hollingsworth is a 33-year-old businessman. He is worth at least $58.5 million and probably much more; even that first number would make him one of the Congress's richest members. And Hollingsworth really, really wants to be a congressman. On May 3, the day Trump clinched his nomination in Indiana, Hollingsworth won a five-way GOP primary. ""Tennessee Trey,"" as both Republicans and Democrats have taken to calling him, has now loaned his campaign almost $3 million. A friendly super PAC has added a million more. Historically, a carpetbagger was a Northern opportunist who moved to the Reconstruction South, hoping to seize wealth and power. This makes Trey Hollingsworth a neat inversion in that he's a Southern opportunist who's come to prey on the North. It's become an interesting experiment in Indiana: If spotted a personal fortune, a sophisticated campaign, a gerrymandered district, and a squishy campaign finance system, can a man literally buy himself a seat in Congress? * * * Hollingsworth has a perfect candidate biography, if only he were running in Tennessee. He was born in 1983 and grew up near Knoxville, in the small town of Clinton, where his father operated an industrial development firm, the Hollingsworth Companies. Joe Hollingsworth Jr. clearly loved his business, his family, and the South. He gave money to politicians from both parties and cultivated a large influence in local politics; some thought he might run for governor, though he never did. Joe owned a 118-foot yacht and named it Savannah. Each year, he threw a lavish Big Orange gala to celebrate the University of Tennessee's football team. At those galas, Trey Hollingsworth would often serve as a host, mingling among the orange jerseys and the Mayberry-inspired decor. He attended a private school in Knoxville, where he rowed, played soccer, and demonstrated an astonishing degree of ambition. One summer, when he was 15, he went to a summer camp for young entrepreneurs. Hollingsworth told a reporter there that he tried to sleep only three hours a night in order to work on his internet startup. But he refused to describe the startup itself since he was worried someone might swipe his idea. Hollingsworth never did make it to Silicon Valley. Instead, he went to Wharton, then started a new company shortly after graduation. His father played a crucial role. While the Hollingsworths have not shared many details from this period, an old press release on his father's website says, ""Hollingsworth Capital Partners was formed with Joe's son, Trey, as managing partner and majority owner."" The passive voice is doing a lot of work in that sentence. But regardless of how much help Hollingsworth got, he became a successful businessman in his own right. His company has specialized in finding and refurbishing abandoned factories and warehouses from all over. Much of Hollingsworth's wealth now comes from his real estate holdings in Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Alabama, Virginia, and of course Tennessee, among others. At some point, Hollingsworth identified another neglected asset: Indiana's 9th Congressional District. Last summer, the incumbent, Todd Young, announced he was running for the U.S. Senate, opening up a district that Republicans had redrawn after 2010 and that Young had carried by 28 points in 2014. Hollingsworth seems to have been living in South Carolina at the time; he'd married his Louisville-born wife there, in a garden party-ish ceremony at Charleston's Lowndes Grove Plantation, complete with ""Southern-style hors d'oeuvres."" But it wasn't long before Hollingsworth moved to a rented luxury condo in Jeffersonville, a town just across the river from Louisville. Because he'd never voted in a Hoosier primary, Hollingsworth needed the blessing of a Republican county chairman before he could legally run for Congress. He called the chairman in Jeffersonville's Clark County, though at first Hollingsworth refused to give his name. He also hinted that if the chairman didn't sign off on his candidacy he could just move to another county in the 9th District where someone else would. The chairman agreed to help, provided Hollingsworth sign a GOP loyalty pledge. Once approved, Hollingsworth hit the trail hard. His campaign in short order hired a media firm from New Jersey; a financial firm from San Diego; an opposition research firm from Dallas; and a pollster, a lawyer, and a digital media specialist from Washington, D.C. By the end of 2015, Hollingsworth had given or loaned his campaign $685,577. In that same period, his campaign reported exactly one donation from an Indiana resident, a thousand bucks from a Jeffersonville retiree. Most of Hollingsworth's money went to TV ads, and on this front he received some mysterious help. His media firm started throwing sumptuous B-roll up on YouTube--Hollingsworth touring his Indiana industrial sites, Hollingsworth sitting in his expertly staged condo, Hollingsworth strolling through downtown Jeffersonville with his wife. In January, a new super PAC, Indiana Jobs Now, began running commercials that used this footage. No one knew who was behind the super PAC until it filed its first quarterly Federal Election Commission report in April. All of the money, eventually more than a million dollars, had come from Joe Hollingsworth Jr. It's hard to think of a better campaign finance farce than a father supporting but not ""coordinating"" with his son. The ads provided a huge advantage. One thing that's helped Hollingsworth in the 9th District is that the only way to get real TV coverage is by making expensive and inefficient ad buys in Louisville and Indianapolis. Hollingsworth's financial edge let him run so many commercials that Jeffersonville residents soon recognized the footage of him walking their city's streets--even though no one in town seemed to have had any interaction with him in real life. Another perk of the 9th District is that it doesn't have much local media, and Hollingsworth frequently dodged what media there was. When he did agree to interviews, he often evaded, even on seemingly benign questions. He declined to release his tax returns. When someone asked him to name his three favorite Hoosiers, he declined to do that, too. One reporter asked him where he'd lived before moving to Indiana; ""I'll have to go back,"" Hollingsworth said, speaking about his own life, ""and check the record."" Pressed on when exactly he moved to Indiana, he finally answered with early summer. Another reporter tried to clarify whether that meant June or July. ""I think that's a good characterization,"" Hollingsworth said. Still, Hollingsworth eventually settled on an effective message. One of the stranger things about his congressional dreams is that Hollingsworth doesn't have much history of political interest or ideology. The Indianapolis Star found no trace of his having ever voted in a Tennessee primary, Republican or Democrat. But on the issues, he opted for standard Republican--Christian, conservative, angry at Obama. On his background, he said he moved to Jeffersonville to be closer to his wife's family in Louisville. (Of course his earlier threat to move elsewhere in the 9th District complicated that story.) He talked about the 11 years he'd spent renovating businesses in Indiana, and he never mentioned his holdings in many other states. In a crowded primary, that was enough. His Republican opponents called him a ""carpetbagger"" and ""Tennessee Trey"" and even a ""political scam artist."" But Hollingsworth won with 34 percent of the vote. As of this writing, he has given his campaign $102,072 and loaned it another $2.7 million. He is also in a dead heat with the Democratic candidate, Shelli Yoder, who grew up in Indiana, teaches at Indiana University, and is a former Miss Indiana to boot. * * * I happen to live in the 9th District, and one October day I drove to Brownstown, Indiana, to watch Hollingsworth interact with some Hoosiers. Brownstown (population 2,947) is the kind of place where you see a few signs for Hillary Clinton, a fair number for Donald Trump, and an overwhelming number for the high school football team (currently ranked ninth in 3A!). It's one of the nicest county seats in the district, with a downtown that's small but mostly full, and a big reason for all this civic spirit is Brownstown's Exchange Club. Each Tuesday, the club meets at Michie's Diner to eat breakfast, plan its latest community fundraiser, or talk with a guest. On the Tuesday I visited, there were about 15 members in attendance, most of them retired or close to it. Hollingsworth showed up early, wearing nice jeans and a smart button-down. In his TV ads he can seem a bit robotic, but in person he quickly revealed himself to be an excellent retail politician. It helped that he'd had lots of practice; according to his campaign, he's called 15,000 voters and knocked on 25,000 doors. Once it was time to start, everyone stood up. Hollingsworth hammered his hand over his heart--a bit too quickly since the sequence was actually prayer, then pledge. Those preliminaries completed, he began to talk. ""My campaign's about two things,"" he said. The first was his business background. ""I've been building and renovating businesses in Indiana for 11 years,"" he said, and he explained his frustrations with America's tax code and over-regulation. He promised he could keep jobs ""from going overseas or, God forbid, going to Illinois."" The second thing was public service. Too many in Washington were political insiders--people worried about moving to a corner office ""instead of serving Hoosiers."" It was odd to see someone who'd spent so much time and money in search of a congressional seat accusing others of careerism. But Hollingsworth also promised to push for term limits. In fact, he signed a term-limits pledge at each door he knocked on. After four terms, he said, he would ""re-engage with the private sector."" Hollingsworth agreed to take questions. At first it went as you'd expect in a small Midwestern town. The first question was on immigration. (""I believe the first step,"" Hollingsworth said, ""is securing our Southern border."") The second was on federalism and returning power to the states. (""A bureaucrat a thousand miles away doesn't know how to solve Brownstown's problems."") Before long, though, the discussion shifted. One person asked about Obamacare. ""I'm a repeal-and-replace guy,"" Hollingsworth replied. But that elicited only more responses. Another person pointed out that the law guaranteed a range of benefits, including the 80/20 rule, the ban on gender rating, and coverage for pre-existing conditions. Hollingsworth--and a couple of the club's more conservative members--offered counterpoints, including the number of insurers leaving the marketplace and the fear that doctors were facing new restrictions on what services they could provide. One man, whom everyone called simply ""pastor,"" emerged as Hollingsworth's main interlocutor. The pastor, whose name is Kevin Stiles, explained how he'd retired from Brownstown's United Methodist Church, which meant he and his wife had lost their insurance. While he'd returned to the pulpit part-time, they hadn't been able to find coverage because his wife's heart problem was considered a pre-existing condition. They'd spent a year in financial and medical terror, until Obamacare came along. Hollingsworth listened patiently but took a longer view. ""I don't believe government mandates and government monopolies will deliver the best outcome over the long term,"" he said. ""Right, now my wife is insured,"" Stiles replied. ""Before she wasn't."" ""A single instance doesn't mean it's working,"" Hollingsworth said. ""That's the instance I care about."" We were reaching some kind of philosophical limit--a place where two worldviews simply couldn't be reconciled. Still, the conversation had been civil and deep and free of cross talk. It was a nice reminder that even in place like Brownstown, a place that had gone for Romney by more than 20 points, there were still hundreds of people who'd voted for Obama and then found a way to get along with their neighbors, and their neighbors with them. There was one more lively exchange that morning. ""Would you agree that money is a corrupting influence in politics?"" another left-leaning club member asked. ""I do not know that I would say that,"" Hollingsworth said. The candidate who had seemed so crisp, talking health care and cracking jokes about Illinois, turned abstract and evasive. He started sounding a lot like he did when reporters inquired about his old addresses. Someone brought up the Koch brothers and their right to spend their money--to express their free speech. ""That's an argument that's been made,"" Hollingsworth said, ""and I have some sympathy with it."" But couldn't that kind of money buy a politician's ear, asked someone else? ""I think it's a fair point,"" Hollingsworth said, ""and there are a lot of people who are concerned."" What was striking about the conversation (and the whole morning) was that it could've taken place anywhere--in Indiana or Tennessee or South Carolina or any other state. No one asked Hollingsworth about his money corrupting politics, and no one asked about his relocation, either. I don't think this was just Hoosier politeness. Hollingsworth's biography clearly bothers some voters. After all, the race is close, and in one recent poll of the 9th District a quarter of respondents brought up the carpetbagging by themselves. But educated and passionate voters like the guys in the Exchange Club? They care more about partisan issues. Later, when I asked them about Hollingsworth's Tennessee-ness, they all admitted they'd been thinking about it at the breakfast. One guy said he'd listened for any traces of a Southern accent. (It's gone.) Another conceded that Hollingsworth's move made him uncomfortable. But then he turned defensive. ""Hillary Clinton broke the mold when she ran for Senate in New York,"" he said. ""She's a lot more of a carpetbagger than Trey."" Even the pastor said that Hollingsworth's move didn't bother him as much as his ideas. I asked if he'd vote for Yoder, the Democrat, if she were the carpetbagger. ""I'd probably do it with a guilty conscience,"" Stiles said, ""but I'd still vote on the issues."" Hollingsworth may not get his seat, but there's no question his bid was made easier by the fact that, more and more, all politics is national. There are lots of reasons for this--the gravitational pull of the presidential election, the hyperpolarization of our politics in general, Congress's post-2010 ban on earmarks. Earmarks let representatives score cash or tax breaks for pet projects, often back home in their districts. A pork-free or pork-light politics is a politics coming unmoored from the straightforward votes-for-stuff transactions at the heart of local representation. In their place we get appeals to our tribal (i.e., national) loyalties. In the Indiana 9th election, neither Yoder nor Hollingsworth has spent much time talking district-level issues. When Yoder has hit him on the carpetbagging, he's countered by linking her to Clinton and the Democrats. Joe Hollingsworth's super PAC has even given her her own alliterative nickname: ""Socialist Shelli."" At the Brownstown breakfast, Hollingsworth fielded other questions, on Social Security and Syrian refugees. But eventually he had to head to his next campaign stop. There was time for one last order of business: the weekly drawing. The Exchange Club has been doing this for years now. At the start of each breakfast, the members chip in a buck apiece, with half the pot going to charity and the other to the winner of next week's drawing. Stiles asked Hollingsworth to do the honors, and the candidate reached in and drew a name out of an old Folger's can: the club's secretary, Steve. Before anyone could congratulate him, Steve admitted that he'd skipped last week's meeting and shouldn't be eligible. He proposed they roll the prize over to the next breakfast. ""Now that,"" someone said, ""is an honest man."" Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	How to Buy a Seat in Congress
23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/talking_to_hillary_clinton_voters_in_north_carolina_about_why_they_re_voting.html	"CHAPEL HILL, North Carolina--We know what Donald Trump's voters think. Journalists have spent the past year plumbing the depths of their feelings, extracting their views of the country and where it stands. Trump backers are ""angry."" They're ""frustrated."" They're looking for a radical change to the status quo. By contrast, the press has spent less time speaking to voters for Hillary Clinton, despite the fact that she has received the most support of any candidate this year and will serve--if she wins--as the first female president of the United States. There are good reasons for this: Trump is a novel candidate, which makes him and his backers a natural locus for attention. Still, there's an oversight here. And it's with that oversight in mind that I've spent the past week in North Carolina speaking to Clinton supporters at early voting events held throughout the state. On Tuesday, for instance, a modest crowd of Clinton backers packed into a community gymnasium in Charlotte to hear Vice President Joe Biden, with introductions from Roy Cooper and Deborah Ross, the Democratic nominees for governor and Senate, respectively. Sabir Majumder is a longtime Democrat who migrated from Bangladesh to the United States 30 years ago. He voted early but came to the Biden event to talk to other Democrats and take in the boisterous atmosphere of an election-year rally. He supports Clinton, but not without familiar misgivings. ""Classified information is classified and it has to be treated really well,"" he said, speaking about Clinton's emails and recent FBI revelations. ""I don't know everything, but the way I look at it, it may be problematic. Still, I support her because of bigger issues. I might have looked at it differently if there was a better candidate, but there is none. There is none. So, I have to pick one."" Gwen Jenkins moved to North Carolina from California and has lived in the area for eight years. Like many Americans, she is dismayed by the tone and tenor of the election. ""I am very, very saddened by the degradation that has happened in the campaign, just in all of the nastiness and negativity,"" she said. Despite attending a rally for early voting, Jenkins hasn't cast a ballot yet. But she will, on Election Day proper: ""I find joy in the day of voting. I will stand in the long line with my husband and wait on the polls to open."" And it's worth saying that Jenkins, an older black woman, doesn't know a single person who voted in 2012 but who doesn't plan to vote this year. ""The people that I know are excited to vote,"" she said. On Wednesday, President Obama held a massive rally for Clinton at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. Thousands of people crowded on to the university's intramural fields to hear Obama stump for his prospective successor, in what very well may be his final visit to the state as president. He was feisty, and the crowd responded in kind, with constant clapping, cheers, and excitement. His message, however, was stark. ""All the progress we hope to make over the next eight years, all of that goes out of the window if we don't win this election. And we don't win this election, potentially, if we don't win North Carolina,"" Obama said. ""So I hate to put a little pressure on you, but the fate of the republic rests on your shoulders. The fate of the world is teetering and you, North Carolina, are going to have to make sure that we push it in the right direction."" Like Tim Kaine did during his stop in the state, Obama stressed Republican-led attacks on the voting rights of black voters. ""A federal judge said that, based on the evidence, those who voted for these laws targeted black voters with, and I'm quoting, 'surgical precision.' Here, in North Carolina,"" stressed the president. ""The list of voters the Republicans tried to purge was two-thirds black. That was not an accident,"" he said. Obama then tied this to a longer history of racism, describing poll taxes and literacy tests with the refrain ""it wasn't that long ago."" When I spoke to black voters at the event, they also emphasized the role of racism in shaping this election year. ""I think people are nervous about the direction we're heading in with so many minority groups rising up, taking on corporate positions, political positions,"" said Constance Martinez, an auditor who lives in the area. ""They think America is going to be snatched from underneath them."" Marcel Jaff is an immigrant from Cameroon who says he was motivated to vote early after seeing that President Obama had done the same. This is his third election since becoming a citizen, and he has paid close attention to every twist and turn in the race. Jaff too sees racism as the key factor. ""It just seems to me that there is some kind of a backlash,"" he said. ""And you can't deny that it has to do with race."" The popular narrative of this election is that it represents a rising nationalist tide in American politics. And that's true, although this nationalism is shaped and defined by white identity and white racism. But there's another side to that story, revealed in conversations with voters of color. For them, this election is one where they assert their place in the United States--where they say that this is their country too. ""They aren't losing anything,"" said Martinez of Trump voters. ""They are gaining so much more. As a united people we are so much more than we are divided. I hope this election shows them that they have nothing to fear. That we are one country and we are moving toward one people."" Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	For Minority Voters, a Ballot for Clinton Is a Proclamation That This Is Their Country Too
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/an_election_day_holiday_might_not_increase_turnout_studies_demonstrate.html	"Every Election Day, millions of Americans try to wrest enough time away from work to vote. And millions of them fail. According to the Census Bureau, about 28 percent of registered voters who failed to vote in 2014 said they were too busy to do so--far more than those giving any other excuse. Being busy was also the most cited reason for not voting in 2012, 2010, and 2008. A (small-sample) Pew poll from 2014 found that 35 percent of registered voters who failed to vote in 2014 specifically cited work and school conflicts as impediments. Consequently, every year many voters raise the same question: Why can't we give people a day off to do their civic duty and cast a ballot? Concern for these voters motivated a 2005 bill from Rep. John Conyers and a bill last year from Bernie Sanders that would turn Election Day into a federal holiday, Democracy Day. Neither bill has gone anywhere since introduction, but that doesn't mean the idea doesn't have popular appeal. Last year, a coalition of progressive groups launched a campaign to have President Obama give federal workers a paid day off next Tuesday. That isn't happening, but Obama did signal support for an Election Day holiday, along with other proposals aimed at boosting voter turnout such as weekend voting and automatic registration, in an interview with the Rutgers student newspaper over the summer: ""Everything we can do to make sure that we're increasing participation is something that we should promote and encourage,"" he said. He's right, of course, but it's not clear that making Election Day a federal holiday would be a desirable or effective solution to our dismal turnout record. As Inc.'s Suzanne Lucas pointed out recently, a federal holiday would actually burden many retail and service employees at the kinds of workplaces that don't shut down for federal holidays:"	Making Election Day a Holiday Might Hurt More Working-Class Voters Than It Helps
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/panic_about_the_election_it_s_worth_it.html	"Several friends and co-workers have come up to me since FBI Director James Comey sent his little letter over to Congress. They want to know if they should be ""worried."" Should I panic? they ask. I tell them they should, because the letter may not be enough to push Donald Trump over the top. Once I'm done trolling them, though, I give the real answer: Of course you should panic that Hillary Clinton might lose if you're at all concerned about Donald Trump being president. Fear should be your guiding emotion this week. Fear, panic, terror, horror, apoplexy--mmm mmm, this is the stuff. Each new poll that shows movement in Trump's direction, whether it's a good poll or a crap poll, should exponentially multiply that fear. If you're in the proper headspace right now, you're not sleeping. You're gaining weight. There will be plenty of time to feel happy and comforted later. Or there won't be. There's an opposing school of thought out there, among Democrats and perhaps anti-Trumpers in general, that finite energy is better spent on reassuring the like-minded that Clinton's still got this. David Plouffe, the 2008 Obama campaign manager and 2012 adviser, famously refers to those losing their mind about polling fluctuations as ""bed-wetters."" Anti-bed-wetting is a common mantra you still hear from Plouffe's disciples whenever Clinton's chances enter a down cycle. Plouffe himself has continued playing around with wetting-related imagery on Twitter as polling has tightened over the past few days: Plouffe's larger point is well-taken: There's no use in just sitting on your couch reading the bad news on Twitter and pissing yourself. The proper way to respond to any doubts about Clinton winning is to do something about it, like encouraging others to vote. Anti-bedwetting is a necessary posture for those working in the campaign: Staffers should not let polling fluctuations dictate panicky changes in strategy or messaging. The goal should always be the same: turning out your voters. And when Democrats turn out their voters, they win. The importance of turning out Democratic voters, though, is why all anti-Trumpers should be in an absolutely heightened state of panic through Election Day, because Democratic voters can be unreliable. Maybe some people are worried they won't look cool to their peers if they start shrieking or stress-vomiting in public about how Donald Trump could be president when the data doesn't (yet) support that. What these people should do is stress-vomit on the faces of their cooler-than-thou peers, and tell them that this a cleansing shower compared with the conditions at any one of would-be President Trump's work camps. Because even after all this time, even after all the other brushes Trump's had with approximate parity in the race, a lot of those voters who absolutely don't want Trump to be president still don't think there's any chance he could win. This underlies the whole question about whether to panic: There's still no way he could win, right? There's always been a chance he could win. As of this writing, the FiveThirtyEight average gives Trump a 31 percent chance of winning. That may rise higher by the end of the day or Thursday morning, as more state-level data showing Republicans coming home to Trump is chucked into the model. Further, the volatility, relative sparseness, and crappiness of this year's polling, plus the general loathing of each candidate, is a stew for systemic polling error. Obama outperformed his national polling average by about 3 percentage points in 2012, in a much more stable, measurable race. A few-point swing one way or another is the difference between a Clinton Electoral College landslide and a narrow Trump win. An additional few points in Trump's direction in Pennsylvania alone could tip the election. Don't ask someone else whether you should panic. Of course you should. The only legitimate argument against constructive panicking in the last week of an election is that panicking is an unpleasant feeling. People want to feel calmed and comforted. This sort of foo-foo, twee, coddled, teddy-bear garbage speak is why Trump is anywhere near the presidency in the first place. No one should feel happy in the last week of an election cycle like this. No one should feel safe. No one should expect a reasonable measure of comfort or happiness. How should you feel if you really do believe Trump's election would be a national and global disaster? Picture yourself hanging over a cliff, holding on by one hand to a skinny tree branch, slipping, staring into the bottomless chasm of death. That's a close approximation of how you should be feeling, and it should inspire you to get as many of your bum friends and family members and distant acquaintances on Facebook to vote. Lose your mind now for any hope of recovering it later. Panic, for lack of a better word, is good. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Of Course You Should Be Panicking About the Election
26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/how_donald_trump_uses_language_and_why_we_can_t_stop_listening.html	For some of us, Trump's language is incendiary garbage. It's not just that the ideas he wants to communicate are awful but that they come out as Saturnine gibberish or lewd smearing or racist gobbledygook. The man has never met a clause he couldn't embellish forever and then promptly forget about. He uses adjectives as cudgels. You and I view his word casserole as not just incoherent but representative of the evil at his heart. But it works. Vast swaths of Americans find themselves in Trump's verbal thrall, nodding along as his mind empties its baleful, inchoate contents out through his mouth and into the world. In a business in which what you say holds incredible sway with those who are going to decide whether to hire you, this rambling weirdo has overachieved to the point of being a Clinton scandal away from the presidency. Why? What's the secret to Trump's accidental brilliance? A few theories: simple component parts, weaponized unintelligibility, dark innuendo, and power signifiers. Despite the often-complicated work they do, Trump's speeches are built from basic, readily understood elements. One analysis, citing loosely woven sentences and a cramped, simplistic vocabulary, found that he talks just below a sixth-grade reading level, compared with the eighth- to 10th-grade reading levels at which his competitors speak. Another paper discovered that 78 percent of the words Trump deploys are monosyllabic. (Sad!) Trump's most avidly used term is I, followed by Trump, very, China, and money. Simple sentences and one-cent words may not win admiration from the Walter Paters of the world, but they do aid comprehension, which increases their processing fluency and makes them ring true, even when they're not. What's more, as Evan Puschak has discussed, Trump tends to place the most viscerally resonant words at the end of his statements, allowing them to vibrate in our ears. For instance, unfurling his national security vision like a nativist pennant, Trump said:	The Accidental Brilliance of Trump's Speaking Style

How did we get here? Read on. As late as last week, voters on both sides were united in the sincere belief that the candidates had litigated all relevant points of disagreement, explained their differing visions for the nation, and revealed the true measure of their characters. As we began to wrestle with our fateful decision, we believed we had all the information we needed. All that was left was the grave task--so fundamental to democracy--of weighing that information and making our fateful choice. But no! Thanks to FBI Director James Comey, we now know that there may exist additional emails of some kind that are relevant in some way to Hillary Clinton's candidacy. With just days to go, how should voters synthesize this bombshell with what we already knew about Clinton and her rival? Slate is here to help. For purposes of comparison, we present these complete accountings of the candidates' offenses and misdemeanors. Weigh them according to your personal moral compass, then print them out and take them to the polls to help you decide. Good luck.	How to Choose Between the Most Corrupt, Least Popular Candidates of All Time
28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/why_are_we_talking_about_hillary_clinton_s_emails.html	"There was a fleeting moment several weeks ago when America finally seemed to get serious. Donald Trump had coasted through the early primary season with soft press coverage and insufficient scrutiny. Even as late as this summer, he was going on late-night shows and sitting for lollipop interviews, all of which had the effect of normalizing him, of inviting him into the national living room. But then things started to change. The major newspapers, especially the Washington Post and the New York Times, began examining his finances more extensively. Typically ovine cable news anchors, either embarrassed by their past coverage or fed up with Trump's racism and misogyny, dared to challenge him. (He eventually just stopped appearing on their shows.) And the infamous Access Hollywood tape, followed by a depressing stream of women coming forward to say that Trump's sexual assault boast was a rare and grotesque moment of honesty from him, caused even many Republicans to wince. It wasn't long ago that GOP officeholders were intoning grave sentiments about what electing a man like Trump might mean for the country, its values, and its traditions. And yet, here we are just eight days from the election and Donald Trump is not even the lead story. Instead, the media--every institution from the cable news networks to the New York Times--have gone mad obsessing over the latest news about Hillary Clinton's emails. The disgrace of this is not merely that we have no idea what the latest revelation from FBI Director James Comey will or will not tell us about Clinton's behavior. It is also that the entire press corps has shifted its focus to a relatively minor issue at a time when Donald Trump remains the primary threat to American democracy. The blame for the latest scandal--and here I refer to the hyperventilating about the emails, rather than the emails themselves--can be assigned to any number of people. Hillary Clinton made the decision in the first place to use a private email server, which, however commonplace, is an affront to the Freedom of Information Act and record retention and all that boring good-government stuff that doesn't seem to come up much in any of the hootin' and hollerin' over the emails. Clinton also spent much too long equivocating over how to respond. And on Friday, after Comey's letter to Congress became public, her campaign decided that the best approach was to attack the FBI director, practically begging him to reveal more about his investigation. Maybe this was the right move, but the strategy certainly gave the story enough oxygen to last the weekend and perhaps the whole of this week. The press was already anxious for what we tiresomely insist on calling an October surprise, and the fact that large chunks of the Democratic Party decided to go to war with the FBI director only made the controversy a juicier one. Now it seems clear that the Justice Department itself is riven with internal disagreement over investigating Hillary Clinton, and these turf wars will of course play out in the press over the next few days, with volleys and return volleys of bitchcakes quotes from anonymous insiders. There are important issues in play here. The evident problems at the Justice Department are not only significant, but another sign of the great enervation of our institutions at a moment when their very legitimacy is being called into question. ThinkProgress' Judd Legum suggests Comey was overcorrecting in response to a monthslong assault by the GOP on the FBI's authority. ""Republicans worked the refs at the FBI,"" Legum tweeted, ""and it worked."" This is something like what happened to Clinton in the 1990s, when she responded to attacks of all kinds from the right by retreating into a garrison mentality, which itself became the subject of attacks of all kinds from the right (and which probably had something to do with her unfortunate decision to use a private email server). All of these things are worth covering in some fashion. But enough is enough. Journalism is about choosing what to cover as much as it is deciding how to cover something. (Jerry Seinfeld has an old joke about how incredible it is that every day on Earth the amount of news that occurs--no more, no less--always fits precisely in the newspaper.) Donald Trump's sins against every building block of good government--from hiring competent people to making any effort whatsoever at transparency to distinguishing one's self-interest from the larger interest--render Clinton's shortcomings minuscule and insignificant in comparison. We are extremely close to the most important American election since God knows when, an election whose reverberations are almost impossible to imagine, let alone measure. Let's focus on that for a change. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Trump Is on the Ballot Next Week, and We're Talking About Emails. What the Hell Are We Doing?
29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/why_the_weiner_emails_won_t_matter.html	"On the eve of the election, Slate's revisiting our best stories from the campaign. How did we get here? Read on. On Friday, Americans got their second ""October surprise"" of the presidential election. The first was the Access Hollywood tape in which Donald Trump boasted of sexual assault. This one was less evocative but still shocking: a letter from FBI Director James Comey on the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server. Initially, this looked explosive. ""In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation,"" Comey wrote to Republican congressional committee chairmen. ""I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review those emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation."" According to U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, the FBI was ""reopening"" the investigation. But this was wrong. Subsequent reporting filled in details. Having told Congress that he would keep them abreast of developments in the Clinton case, Comey was obligated to send them this letter. The emails didn't come from Clinton; there was no withholding of evidence from either Clinton or her campaign; and the emails themselves came from outside her server. Specifically, the FBI retrieved them from a device used by Anthony Weiner, as part of its investigation into his allegedly sexting an underage girl. That leaves us with the politics of the revelation. How will it affect the election? Could the mere mention of ""emails"" change perceptions toward Clinton? When the news first broke, conservative commentators were sure that this would change the shape of the election. ""This is not good for Team Clinton,"" said Josh Kraushaar of National Journal. One vocal commentator, Matt Mackowiak, insisted that this ""must be very serious"" and that the uncertainty of it all was ""politically lethal."" At this stage, we have no idea how this development will shape the last 11 days of the presidential race. Tens of millions of Americans have already voted in battleground states like North Carolina, Florida, Texas, and Nevada. Given the effect of past email news, it's possible this will turn off independent or undecided voters from Clinton. It's also possible that her negatives are already baked in and won't budge. And it's possible, perhaps likely, that it won't matter at all. Everyone agrees that American politics is more partisan and more polarized than it's ever been. But not everyone grasps why that's important. It's not just Congress and the ability of our institutions to make progress and accomplish their goals. It's also our elections. The folk theory of American democracy is that citizens deliberate on the issues and choose a candidate. That is false. The truth, as political scientists Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels describe in Democracy for Realists: Why Elections Do Not Produce Responsive Government, is that voters are tribalistic. Their political allegiances come first, and their positions and beliefs follow. We've seen this with Donald Trump. Support for free trade is a longstanding belief within the GOP, but Trump is a major opponent, slamming most of the trade deals of the past 30 years. You would think that this would depress his support among Republican voters. It didn't. Instead, those voters changed their views of trade. Their beliefs followed their affiliations, not the other way around. When it comes to elections--or at least, presidential elections--this leads to an important conclusion: What a candidate believes is less important to voters than his or her partisan affiliation. Trump has passionate supporters who believe in his message of ethnonationalism and racial exclusion. But the reason he's a stone's throw from the White House isn't because he's convinced 50 million Americans that he's right. The reason Trump is relatively close is that he's the Republican presidential nominee, and in a partisan, highly polarized country, that's enough. In the past four presidential elections, major party nominees have won the vast majority of co-partisans--upward of 90 percent. Simply having the nomination is sufficient to put anyone in firing distance of becoming president, regardless of larger circumstances or events or personality deficiencies. There are still battles to fight, but they happen on the margins and involve a small share of voters. This polarization is so strong, in fact, that it renders the gaffes and incidents of recent elections almost irrelevant. Mitt Romney's remarks on the ""47 percent"" in the 2012 election were bombshells that changed the immediate landscape of the election. But a month later, the effect had died down. In a real way, it didn't matter. Again, we've seen the same with Trump. Scandals affect his numbers, but he always recovers, as Republicans return to his camp. It's even happening now, as GOP voters look past the Access Hollywood tape to line up behind the real estate mogul. If the final week of an election is a time of mass mobilization and hyperpartisanship, then the best odds are that the Weiner emails--and the renewed focus on Clinton's email server--won't matter. Indeed, that's what it means for an electorate to be polarized. Whether pundits even begin to understand that is a separate question. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."
