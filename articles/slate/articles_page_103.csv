A final deal has yet to be struck, but Obama said the new measures ""will spur our private sector and create millions of new jobs."" Maybe so. But if the past decade of experience with the Bush tax cuts is any indicator, this new round of cuts and credits won't do much. On Meet the Press this week, David Gregory asked Sen. Mitch McConnell to defend the Bush tax cuts. ""You've had these tax rates in place since 2001,"" he said. ""What's been the impact on jobs?"" ""Imagine,"" McConnell responded, ""how much worse it would have been if we'd had the higher tax rate."" Never mind that McConnell has rejected that same argument--it could have been so much worse!--when Obama used it to defend the stimulus package. There's little evidence that the Bush tax cuts have had any significant effect on job growth over the last decade. Indeed, there's not a lot of evidence that tax cuts alone boost the economy much at all. You'd never know this from listening to Congress fight. Republicans say the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 boosted job growth, reduced unemployment, and inspired porpoises to save Dick Van Dyke from drowning. Democrats would have you believe those same cuts precipitated the slowest GDP growth since World War II, not to mention the worst recession since the Great Depression. Both sides overstate their case. The theory behind tax cuts and job growth is solid: Individuals are more likely to look for work when they can keep more of their wages, and businesses are more likely to hire people when they can keep more of their revenue. Lower taxes, more workers, more jobs--everybody wins. But in practice, tax cuts don't significantly boost jobs. ""I don't know of any convincing evidence that says these things were a huge contributor to growth over the past decade,"" says Joseph Rosenberg, a research associate at the Tax Policy Center. Bush created fewer jobs than any president since World War II except his father and Gerald Ford. GDP growth between 2001 and 2007 was also the slowest over the same period, at 2.39 percent. McConnell is right that without a counterfactual history, it's hard to pinpoint the exact effect of the Bush tax cuts. (For that reason, a 2008 report by the Congressional Research Service concluded that ""it is hard to be certain what effects the tax cuts have had on the economy."") But his premise is flawed: Economists who study the elasticity of taxable income--that is, the extent to which raising taxes makes workers work less--have found that the effect is pretty small. Same when it comes to corporate tax rates: There's just not much evidence that businesses behave differently when they're taxed at 30 percent instead of 35 percent. In other words, we're still on the near side of the Laffer Curve. Extending the Bush tax cuts will help the economy--but just barely. The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that extending the cuts through 2012 would reduce unemployment next year by between 0.1 percent and 0.3 percent and by about twice that the following year. It would also boost GNP by anywhere between 0.3 percent and about 1 percent. But that's just the first two years. If Congress continued to extend the tax cuts beyond 2012, it would soon start hurting growth, since more government borrowing would crowd out investment, and interest rates would go up. That said, the Obama tax cuts may have a better chance of stimulating the economy than Bush's did. For one thing, unemployment is a lot higher now than it was in 2001, which allows more room for improvement. Plus, Democrats have tried to cut taxes in the most stimulative way possible--that is, in a way that benefits the lower and middle classes. Hence the provisions in Monday's compromise to bump the child tax credit and earned income tax credit, plus a reduction of payroll taxes for employees from 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent. The new plan will also extend unemployment insurance. An analysis by Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics finds that extending unemployment insurance (which Congress let expire last week) would generate more economic activity than cutting taxes for people with incomes above $250,000. The logic is simple: Poor people are more likely to spend their extra money than rich people, giving more bang for each federal buck. If Republicans were serious about helping the economy--and not just their constituents--they would have been pushing to extend unemployment insurance, not just granting it as a concession. If taxes don't affect the overall economy much, why do politicians talk about cuts and hikes like they determine the fate of the earth? Because it's one of the few things they control. ""This is one of the tools that politicians have,"" says Rosenberg. ""They'd like to think it's effective, even if it maybe isn't."" That way, they can take credit if the economy improves and cast blame if it doesn't--rather than simply chalking it up to larger forces. At the very least, they can show voters that they're doing something. In which case, Obama's compromise was a smart move. ""I have no doubt everyone will find something in this compromise they don't like,"" he said on Monday. But he couldn't let the tax cuts on the middle class lapse in the new year--even if it meant extending cuts for the rich. Now, if the economy improves in the next two years, Obama can take some credit. If it doesn't, well, it probably wasn't going to anyway. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	How much will Obama's tax compromise actually help the economy?

They see it in the current fight over extending the Bush tax cuts, where they are certain the president will drop his resistance to a tax-cut extension for everyone, including those in the upper income bracket. ""Fight, Don't Cave on Tax Cuts,"" demands a new ad by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. Moveon.org is also calling on the president to fight and not let himself ""get pushed around."" This has led to questions about Obama's manhood that have taken the form of a Courtland Milloy analogy based on an injury Obama got playing ball to James Carville's inquisition into whether he had two. Liberals are angry not just because of Obama's position on tax cuts at a time of increased income inequality. They're irritated because he appears to be set on following the same strategy for the second half of his term that failed in the first half: reaching out to Republicans, getting shot down by a unified GOP, and getting no credit for trying.  Outgoing Ohio governor Ted Strickland put it this way in an interview with Sam Stein of the Huffington Post: ""I saw what CNN said after that meeting yesterday. ... The president said he should have been willing to work with the GOP earlier. What? After all of this you don't realize these people want to destroy you and your agenda? How many times do you have to be, you know, slapped in the face?""* Rep. Paul Ryan may be the featured character in the latest chapter of the liberal history of this presidency--call it How Obama Is Getting Schooled by Republicans. Paul Krugman calls Ryan a ""flimflam man"" for his ideas about balancing the budget, but last January, when Obama met with House Republicans, he called the Wisconsin lawmaker a ""pretty sincere guy"" whose ""roadmap"" for balancing the budget was a ""serious proposal."" This was seen as an attempt to kindle a little bipartisan goodwill. Today I gave Ryan, who will be chairman of the budget committee in January, an opportunity to return the favor. At a breakfast with reporters hosted by the Christian Science Monitor, I asked him whether he thought the lack of bipartisan cooperation during Obama's first two years was the president's fault alone. Debates about the past are tiresome, but as with budgets, it's instructive to measure each side's baseline view in order to measure future behavior. If they show a little give, they might have it in them to give in the big way Ryan and others say they'll have to in order to get anything done. Obama had said he could have done more to work with Republicans. Did the GOP share any of the blame? ""No, it's all the Democrats' fault,"" Ryan said. ""We're great. We have halos over our heads,"" he added sarcastically. ""How do you want me to answer that?"" he asked. I told him that truthfully would be fine. He seemed boxed-in. Even if he believed Republicans shared some blame, he couldn't admit it. ""They had to make a decision,"" he said, referring to the president and Democratic leaders. ""Do we work with these Republicans and do we meet in the middle? But we don't have to because we have all the votes. They made a choice to go it on their own, and that's when we had to protect ourselves."" He said he tried to reach out to the White House early in the administration on a health care plan. ""We sent a plan to the president, we sent them letters, we called people, we kept trying to talk to them,"" he said. ""It was just a thud."" Of the White House, he said, ""They don't talk to us."" So Republicans didn't share at all in the blame? I asked, just to be clear. Ryan repeated his answer. Now, presented with this anecdote, liberals will have a predictable--and not unreasonable--response: And you want to try to work with these people, Mr. President? Observers can disagree over how much blame Obama deserves for the ill will between the parties. But no fair-minded person can think the blame is Obama's alone. Certainly the public doesn't think that. In polls, Republican congressional leaders are more unpopular than Democrats. Ryan spoke of the need to compromise in the grand budget negotiations to come. He said he didn't want to be doctrinaire:""If you're getting an inch take the inch, even if you're not getting a mile."" He also chuckled at the idea of refusing to increase the debt ceiling, something the RNC chairman and some in the Tea Party support. But even if he feels as though he's being reasonable, he's not likely to look that way to Obama's supporters. If he and GOP leaders can't accept a speck of responsibility for the lack of cooperation, then maybe Obama's liberal critics are right. Any deal with these guys is a trap.

2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/12/dispatches.html	"""President Nazarbayev, like many of his countrymen, has a strong affinity for horses."" Thus begins a cable by an American diplomat titled ""Lifestyles of the Kazakhstani Leadership."" It goes on to introduce a cast of quirky characters, including Defense Minister Danial Akhmetov (""a self-proclaimed workaholic [who] appears to enjoy loosening up in the tried and true 'homo sovieticus' style--i.e., drinking oneself into a stupor""), the president's son-in-law (Elton John played his 41st birthday), and oligarch Aleksandr Mashkevich (""it is not clear what Mashkevich is spending his billions on, but it is certainly not culinary talent""). The cable also contains a vignette about Prime Minister Karim Masimov partying late into the night at an upscale club called Chocolat: ""His companions quickly tired but Masimov remained, dancing alone and animatedly on the stage""--the sad personification of decadent, post-Soviet nihilism. Is the Pulitzer board reading this stuff? The disclosure by WikiLeaks of 250,000 diplomatic cables this week doesn't just shed light on international issues like what to do about Iran's nuclear ambitions or a collapsing North Korea. The leaks also illustrate the art of cable-writing itself. True, most of the documents don't rise above stenography--diplomat X met with foreign leader Y to talk about Z. But at their best, these cables read like their own literary genre, with an identifiable sensibility and set of conventions. When it comes to the style of diplomatic cables, context matters. Like journalists or novelists, diplomats are writing for a market. Cables are meant to brief the diplomatic and military communities on a particular issue, whether it's Afghan power broker Ahmed Wali Karzai or Muslim unrest in France. But they're also written to impress the boss back home. State Department officials receive thousands of cables a year. If you're a foreign service officer stationed in Molvania who wants to stand out, writing a colorful cable could be your ticket. Diplomacy requires observation, intelligence, and a keen understanding of people and their motivations. Cables are an opportunity to show off. Hence the now-famous dispatch by a diplomat in Moscow who attended a wedding in Dagestan, a region in the North Caucasus. The author opens with a thesis (""The lavish display and heavy drinking concealed the deadly serious North Caucasus politics of land, ethnicity, clan, and alliance""), narrates the wedding itself (""The alcohol consumption before, during and after this Muslim wedding was stupendous""), provides dry commentary (the wedding singer ""could not make it because he was shot a few days before the wedding""), and ties it all together with a pithy analysis of how the ceremony reflects the politics of the region. Part sociology, part travel writing, the cable uses the techniques of journalism to draw conclusions about policy. Other cables read as psychological profiles straight out of John le Carre. France Ambassador Charles Rivkin presents a portrait of a ""hyperactive,"" ""mercurial"" President Nicolas Sarkozy, whose wrath his aides fear. Zimbabwe Ambassador Christopher Dell calls Robert Mugabe ""a brilliant tactician"" doomed by ""his ego and belief in his own infallibility; his obsessive focus on the past as a justification for everything in the present and future; his deep ignorance on economic issues (coupled with the belief that his 18 doctorates give him the authority to suspend the laws of economics, including supply and demand); and his essentially short-term, tactical style."" Dell predicts that Mugabe's days are numbered, but doesn't expect repentance: ""Mugabe will not wake up one morning a changed man, resolved to set right all he has wrought. ... He will cling to power at all costs and the costs be damned."" The best cables show diplomacy in action, mind games and all. A report on a meeting between American diplomats and Afghan power broker Ahmed Wali Karzai notes that Karzai is ""widely understood to be corrupt and a narcotics trafficker."" Distrust of Karzai is sometimes explicit (""he also demonstrated that he will dissemble when it suits his needs"") and sometimes implicit: An American representative ""was clear the coalition would not tolerate individuals working at odds to ISAF campaign aims. [Karzai] stated 'nobody is that stupid.' "" I double-checked, and the cable was not written by Aaron Sorkin. Even the most mundane dispatches often provide color. A Canadian intelligence officer doesn't just complain about his countrymen's view of terrorism, he ascribes to them an ""Alice in Wonderland"" worldview. Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev doesn't merely say that Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin disagree: ""We have a saying in Azeri, 'Two heads cannot be boiled in one pot,' "" he tells a diplomat, who calls this ""crude street slang suggesting that two leaders are spoiling for a fight."" A diplomat in Fiji carefully notes the wording of Commonwealth Political Director Amitav Banerji when Banerji says that Prince Charles doesn't ""command the same respect"" as the Queen. This is the jaded, worldly voice of diplomacy. Humor tends toward the ironic. For example, a dispatch by the American ambassador to Kyrgyzstan barely conceals her disdain for Prince Andrew: At a brunch with business leaders in the capital of Bishkek in 2008, the prince ""railed at British anticorruption investigators, who had had the 'idiocy' of almost scuttling"" an arms deal with Saudi Arabia. When a member of the audience suggested that operating in Kyrgyzstan means accommodating corruption, ""the Duke of York laughed uproariously, saying that: 'All of this sounds exactly like France.' "" A cable titled ""A Glimpse Into Libyan Leader Qadhafi's Eccentricities"" stops short of outright mockery, but notes that ""Qadhafi relies heavily on his long-time Ukrainian nurse, Galyna Kolotnytska, who has been described as a 'voluptuous blonde.' "" We are also told, with scornful precision, that the Libyan leader is incapable of climbing ""more than 35 steps"" at a time. Condescension is another defining feature. An American official posted in Tehran in 1979 opines that ""perhaps the single dominant aspect of the Persian psyche is an overriding egoism"" that ""leaves little room for understanding points of view other than one's own."" The diplomat in Libya notes that Qaddafi requested a tent at the United Nations, ""as it offers him a non-verbal way of communicating that he is a man close to his cultural roots."" There's a power imbalance in the cables, too. The foreigners laugh, joke, crack wise. The Americans are calm, aloof, observing but not participating. According to one cable, the Kuwaiti minister of the interior ""sardonically questioned why US NAVCENT forces had gone to the trouble of rescuing foundering Iranian hashish smugglers two weeks earlier, saying 'God meant to punish them with death and you saved them. Why?' "" The minister later suggests a method for getting rid of Guantanamo detainees: ""You picked them up in Afghanistan; you should drop them off in Afghanistan, in the middle of the war zone."" The Americans never crack a smile. Another document recounts a meeting in which Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed ""slapped his knee and said 'you'll never guess what [Pakistani General Pervez] Musharraf asked me ... he asked me whether the UAE had received approval for the Predator!' (Note: the USG's inability to meet the UAE's request for an armed Predator remains a sore point for MbZ, although he has not directly raised the issue with us for some time.)"" In the moment, the Americans probably laughed. In the dispatch, they're a giant blank. Occasionally, the clinical distance of the American narrator disappears, and the dispatches take on the personality of their authors. Kazakhstan Ambassador Richard Hoagland describes a meeting with the vice president of a large oil company ""in a nearly empty restaurant (times are still hard!) at the Radisson hotel in Astana."" The businessman ""is effusive, even theatrical, by nature,"" Hoagland writes. ""When he trusts, he spills his heart. Of course, there's no doubt he also spins his own narrative, as we all do."" Spinning narratives is an important skill for diplomats. Aside from storytelling as a social grace, they must be able to communicate how other countries fit into the American narrative and vice versa. Stories help highlight shared histories and mutual interests. That's how politicians think, too: ""Sarkozy identifies with America,"" writes Ambassador Rivkin in a cable. ""[H]e sees his own rise in the world as reflecting an American-like saga."" Stories are especially useful when dealing with hypotheticals, as diplomats constantly do. They can show that one event leads to another--how, say, Saudi Arabia might pressure Iran to back down from its nuclear ambitions. The ability to tell a convincing narrative may be the difference between strengthening an alliance and weakening it. If the WikiLeaks cables are any indicator, this job is in capable hands.

3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/get_me_assange.html	"It took no time at all for the Justice and State departments to issue condemnations of WikiLeaks for the release of 250,000-odd diplomatic cables. The first tranche of cables started rolling out on Sunday afternoon. The government's angry denunciations of the leaks started in the evening. And then came Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., the incoming chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, calling for the government to go further: He wanted WikiLeaks to be designated a terrorist organization and hunted to the ends of the earth. King knows how to get in front of a story. He scores media hits the way James Patterson sells beach reads. On Christmas Day last year, after Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab attempted to blow up a plane in Detroit and succeeded in burning his genitals, it was King who argued that the Department of Homeland Security had failed and that ""we need to do whatever we can to protect the American people."" On Sunday, he argued that ""WikiLeaks appears to meet the legal criteria for Foreign Terrorist Organization designation."" He pounded tables on MSNBC and Fox News. He got back-up from Sarah Palin. Congressional staffers say they haven't been nudged on the idea of designating WikiLeaks a terrorist organization. But King could push it today with members returning for the last days of the lame-duck session. King has a way of defining the terms of debate. The idea of prosecuting WikiLeaks as a terrorist cell and Julian Assange as its leader has been around since Marc Thiessen floated it last summer. And it's as bad an idea in November as it was in August. Designating a nonviolent group a ""terrorist"" organization is not something the government has ever tried to do. It's not something that would speed along the goal of King, Palin, and Thiessen: Assange in handcuffs or a WikiLeaks server unplugged. Why not? Start with the way Palin defined the problem. In a Facebook post, she called Assange ""an anti-American operative with blood on his hands"" and asked why WikiLeaks couldn't ""at least have had their financial assets frozen just as we do to individuals who provide material support for terrorist organizations."" That's great campaign talk. (Yes, sure, Palin hasn't decided yet whether to run in 2012.) But it doesn't really describe what WikiLeaks is doing or how the Feds see it. King, meanwhile, asked the State Department to look at going after WikiLeaks under the Immigration and Nationality Act, which has been broadly applied since 9/11 to nab suspected terrorists. As loose as it is, though, the act defines ""material support""--that handy phrase Palin used--as ""a safe house, transportation, communications, funds, transfer of funds or other material financial benefit, false documentation or identification, weapons (including chemical, biological, or radiological weapons), explosives, or training."" Yes, leaks are technically ""communications."" But a document dump of outdated information, one that can be accessed by anyone, doesn't fit the bill. ""A definition of material support which includes that would be so broad that it could include scholarly research and op-eds,"" says Emily Berman, a lawyer with the Liberty and National Security Project at NYU Law School. ""If the State Department designated WikiLeaks as a terrorist organization, a law professor working on these issues would immediately be at risk of criminal prosecution."" On Monday, the State Department showed no signs of testing this. Spokesman P.J. Crowley told reporters that the department did not consider document leaks to be assistance to terrorists. The White House was a little murkier; Robert Gibbs told the press that the White House wouldn't ""rule anything out"" in dealing with WikiLeaks, and a White House spokesman responded to my question about the terrorist designation by pointing back to the Gibbs statement. But what else could the White House do if it took King's advice? The president could employ the International Emergency Powers Act. The WikiLeaks mess would be designated a national emergency, and the Treasury Department would be directed to freeze any assets connected to WikiLeaks or Assange. What's the problem with that? Well, there's the precedent--the people currently being targeted under the act are actually terrorists, not anti-war information activists--and there's the tiny problem that nothing King or Palin want to do would shut down WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks doesn't operate with American connections and American assets. King was specific: He wants WikiLeaks classified as a terrorist organization. As Republicans come into power, they're going to explore what can be done. They can't do much. But let's be honest. The quest to find some way to define Assange's group as terrorists is not about fighting terrorism. It's about indulging the fantasy, well put by Cornell law professor William Jacobson, of Assange being hunted down like a Robert Ludlum villain and possibly ""killed while resisting arrest."" And all of this assumes there's something talismanic about declaring someone a ""terrorist."" In reality, American agents could capture any boogeyman they wanted and prosecute him in the United States. The 1992 decision in U.S. v. Alvarez-Machain affirmed that the government was within its rights when a Mexican citizen was abducted and brought to the U.S. to be tried for the murder of a Drug Enforcement Administration agent. ""We have kidnapped people to bring them to justice,"" explains David Cole, a law professor at Georgetown. ""Whether it applies in this case, I don't know."" It probably doesn't. What's being lost in the James Bond scenarios about taking down WikiLeaks is that its current, highly embarrassing leaks don't actually threaten American intelligence assets. They create problems for diplomats, and by extension they embarrass the United States. They cause the State Department to lose face. That's not terrorism as we define it. So how does King or anyone else turn Julian Assange into a terrorist? They either have to define terrorism in some real way that would eventually open up media organizations to terror charges of their own, or WikiLeaks actually has to do something materially to benefit terrorists. Neither scenario seems likely. What is likely: None of this gets past the shouting stage. Video: Julian Assange Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/unfair_share.html	"In 2004, the 9/11 commission faulted the U.S. intelligence community for failing to ""connect the dots."" Agencies need to do a better job of sharing information, the commission wrote in its report. Now, with the release of more than 250,000 diplomatic cables sent by the State Department, some of the dots are all too visible. After 9/11, ""information sharing"" was the new byword. Intelligence analysts blamed the ""stovepiping"" of information that kept important data from reaching the proper people. The  9/11 Commission Report slammed an intelligence system that disseminated information on a ""need-to-know"" basis. After all, the person who needs to know may not know he needs to know. ""Such a system implicitly assumes that the risk of inadvertent disclosure outweighs the benefits of wider sharing,"" the commission wrote. ""These Cold War assumptions are no longer appropriate."" The government learned to share. The intelligence community integrated under the new director of national intelligence. The Department of Homeland Security was created to oversee and coordinate more than 20 agencies. Most important, agencies and departments gained access to one another's databases. One of the biggest databases is the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network, or SIPRNet (pronounced ""sipper-net""), a computer network created in the 1990s and used by the State and Defense departments to share reports--including diplomatic cables--classified as ""secret"" or below. (""Secret"" is a medium level of classification, between ""confidential"" and ""top secret,"" that is defined as information that would cause ""serious damage"" to national security.) Over the last decade, access to SIPRNet has expanded. In 2002, 125 embassies were on the network. In 2005, the number was up to 180. Now about 250 embassies and consulates--almost all of them--can access SIPRNet. The network was also opened up to low-level military personnel--including Pfc. Bradley Manning, the Army intelligence analyst charged with leaking the documents. At first blush, SIPRNet is a cautionary tale of how information sharing can go awry. In the past, whenever a diplomat cabled the State Department, that cable was kept classified for years. Now it's immediately added to the SIPRNet database, where it remains classified but becomes accessible to the millions of military and civilian personnel with clearance to read ""secret"" reports. A 1993 study found that about 3 million people have ""secret"" clearance--that number is almost certainly much larger today. ""If you can get a credit card, you can get a 'secret' clearance,"" says John Pike of GlobalSecurity.org. The more eyeballs that can see a report, the more likely the wrong eyeballs will see it. Can the government fix its information-sharing problem without risking more disclosures? Yes. But the solution isn't to backtrack. If the intelligence community simply made information sharing more difficult, we'd be back to square one. Nor is the answer to raise the classification levels on diplomatic reports and other documents. Say the report that describes Afghan power broker Ahmed Wali Karzai as ""corrupt"" were labeled ""top secret"" instead of merely ""confidential."" Everyone who needed to see that report would then have to be given ""top secret"" clearance, which would allow them to access other sensitive information, which would require yet more reclassification, and so on. The only way to preserve information security without sacrificing information sharing is to limit--or at least track--any individual's access to it. Normally, a database like SIPRNet can flag unusual activity, the same way a credit-card company alerts your bank if you suddenly spend $10,000 in Tijuana. Manning's decision to download a few hundred thousand files should therefore have set off some alarms. That didn't happen. (Manning was caught only after he bragged about his exploits to a hacker who turned him in.) There may have been good reason to waive the normal security measures where Manning was stationed in Iraq. For example, military personnel may have needed quick access to the latest diplomatic and battlefield information. But downloading 1.6 gigabytes worth of files on a wide range of subjects should have tripped even the most basic security system. The WikiLeaks fiasco is not an inevitable consequence of information sharing. It's an inevitable consequence of information sharing done wrong. The scandal will probably have all kinds of chilling effects. Diplomats will be more careful about what they put in writing. Agencies will err on the side of overclassification instead of underclassification. But the only real solution is to enforce information security on the ground level--to make sure that whoever sees the dots is actually trying to connect them. Like Slate on  Facebook.

5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/life_after_russ.html	"In an upset that seemed impossible in June and inevitable by October, Sen. Russ Feingold lost his bid for re-election. Three weeks later, the disappointment lingers for some 1,020,860 Wisconsin voters and at least one ACLU lawyer in Washington. ""I'm still in denial,"" says Laura Murphy, who first met Feingold in the 1990s and is now on her second tour as director of the ACLU's Washington office. ""I have vivid memories of long conversations with him in the weeks after the 9/11 attacks. He was the only person willing to offer amendments or speak out at all against the USA Patriot Act."" In 2010, opposition to invasive government security measures is commonplace, even politically convenient. But back then, Murphy emphasizes, it wasn't. She remembers one member of Congress angrily poking his finger into an ACLU lawyer's chest. ""Do you realize they tried to kill us?"" he shouted. ""Did you forget they're attacking us?"" One of the reasons it's become more politically palatable to attack the government on civil liberties is that Feingold made it so. We sometimes forget that, as well. Most coverage of Feingold's defeat has centered on the ironic fact that it happened after his campaign-finance-reform legislation was gutted last winter by the Supreme Court. But Feingold is perhaps most famous for being the only senator to vote against the Patriot Act. With his defeat, the civil liberties community now finds itself facing a simple yet daunting task: Find another Russ Feingold. Feingold will be hard to replace not just because of his expertise but also because of his situation. In the debate over the Patriot Act, for example, Feingold was one of the few senators who seemed to have actually read the bill.  In a speech explaining his vote, Feingold argued that protecting civil liberties was critically important in wartime as well as in peace, then warned of provisions that would allow for mass arrests, abuse of material witnesses, wiretaps and warrantless searches, changes to FISA and immigration law, deportation, and indefinite detention. Moreover, because of his (seemingly) safe seat, Feingold was able to take on causes that people with serious presidential ambitions--his were not--crab-walked away from. In 2008 Feingold  fought against a provision of a bill that offered amnesty  for the telecom companies engaged in illegal spying. Civil rights and civil liberties activists now need a senator willing to go to the mat on these issues, knowing that he'll probably lose, yet hoping that he can shave off the worst bits of legislation with savvy and stubbornness. Feingold chaired the Constitution Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and was next in line to take over the Foreign Relations Committee. Just as important, he was able to command the attention of the media. (Watch him explain the implications of allowing the government to listen to your overseas phone calls.) It's not clear to the civil liberties crowd who can keep this up in the Senate. In conversations with activists and lobbyists for multiple civil liberties groups, the same small number of possible new Feingolds kept coming up. One candidate is Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota,  who has, for instance, spoken out passionately  about the civil rights implications of the Supreme Court's pro-corporate views. At a Judiciary Committee hearing last spring, Franken closely questioned Assistant Attorney for Civil Rights Tom Perez about what the Justice Department is doing to protect gay and lesbian students from harassment at school. Franken sponsored legislation that prevented private defense contractors from  enforcing mandatory arbitration clauses  for victims of sexual violence. But Franken also disappointed the civil liberties community with a  flip-flop on reauthorization of the Patriot Act in October 2009. People who are passionate on civil liberties issues still cannot explain how Franken could have spoken out so strongly about the bill, then voted to reauthorize it. And Franken--who often prefaces his legal remarks with the warning that he is not a lawyer--may lack the requisite expertise to take up Feingold's mantle. So who else? Some activists point to fellow freshman senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. He's a career attorney who has been an outspoken opponent  of Bush's  war on terror policies, including  waterboarding. He  declassified Office of Legal Counsel memos and railed against  the shoddy lawyering that supported those policies. Whitehouse first gained national attention with his lofty rule-of-law statements and razor-sharp questioning  during the U.S. Attorney scandal. Like Franken, he's been outspoken on gay and lesbian rights. He supports  gay marriage and opposes the military's DADT policy. Like Franken, however, Whitehouse ultimately voted to allow warrantless wiretapping. And neither of the would-be champions has convinced the civil liberties community that he's as willing to engage in a throwdown as Feingold was. ""I think Whitehouse has a lot of potential,"" says Nat Hentoff, the civil libertarian critic who's now a policy scholar at Cato. ""I think Al Franken is Al Franken. He's good at promoting himself. Feingold has been the only Democrat who's told the truth of what's been happening, that Obama has been asking the Congress not to reform the warrantless wiretapping that Bush put in place."" Others who may slide into Feingold's shoes include those senators who co-sponsored legislation that sought to remedy the worst civil liberties provisions of the Patriot Act. The Justice Act, for instance, was introduced by Feingold in September 2009. The bill was co-sponsored by Democrats Dick Durbin of Illinois, Jon Tester of Montana, Tom Udall and Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, Daniel Akaka of Hawaii, and Ron Wyden of Oregon, plus Independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont. For his colleagues, one of Feingold's virtues was his willingness to lead on these issues, making it easier for them to follow. Now one of them may have to take the lead. Of course, there is more than one party in the Senate. Caroline Fredrickson, executive director of the American Constitution Society, speculates that civil liberties fights in a Feingold-less Senate might depend more on Republicans like Rand Paul. That's a promising possibility right now as the sort of people who backed Paul discover a new bottomless pit of anger, this time about TSA pat-downs. But can it be the basis for Feingold-style politics in the Senate? Feingold's civil liberties record was barely an issue in his failed re-election campaign. When it came up, Feingold's opponent, Ron Johnson, an Ayn Rand devotee, said he liked the idea of reviewing the Patriot Act but his main concern about liberty was how President Obama was undermining it. ""So much of the Patriot Act exists in law, and they just put it within that law. I certainly share the concerns [about] civil liberties,"" Johnson said in June. ""Now, if you have Barack Obama in charge versus George Bush--I wasn't overly concerned with George Bush in power. I'm a little more concerned about the Patriot Act when you have Barack Obama."" What made Feingold unique, and perhaps uniquely credible, was his suspicion of government intrusions on privacy regardless of who was president. One final note as we enter the Post-Feingold Era of Civil Liberties: In 2006 Majority Leader Harry Reid put Feingold on the Senate Intelligence Committee. It was a way to hold the intelligence community's feet to the fire on issues of civil liberties and abuses of transparency and accountability. It will be interesting to see which senator is appointed to take Feingold's place. It will either provide some sense of who in the Senate might now take up Feingold's cause--or it will confirm the fact that nobody plans to try. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

When HarperCollins announced the publication of Sarah Palin's  America by Heart, six long months ago, there were signs that it might not be interesting. The book would contain ""selections from classic and contemporary readings that have moved her"" and ""portraits of some of the extraordinary men and women she admires."" If you translated this from press release-ese, it sounded like a clip job. A clip job wouldn't have amused readers who paid $5 or $6 more for this book than they paid for the deeply discounted  Going Rogue. The smart thing to do with a Palin book, if you're a reviewer or a reporter, is to skim it. Look for names that will make good headlines. Look for attack lines and anecdotes. If Barack Obama's name appears in the text, you have a story: Sarah Palin Slams President Over [Insert Subject Here]. But I read America by Heart the same way I read Sarah Palin's first No. 1 New York Times best-seller: I bought it, then tore through it. Palin's memoir, aided substantially by the ghostly talents of Lynn Vincent, was addictively readable. Tabloid-y, possibly true details on the buffoons who staffed Palin's gubernatorial office and 2008 campaign staffs were meshed with anecdotes loaned from Jack London about life on the Last Frontier. I think Joe Biden's memoir is underrated, but there's no image in Promises To Keep that sticks like Palin's  memory of her husband pulling off his mask, and with it some of the flesh on his face, after finishing an Iron Dog snowmobile * race. Keep your expectations for the new book low, and they will be met. The Palin of Going Rogue was a mystery, emerging from a quasi-hiatus in which she communicated online and in infrequent Fox News interviews to tell her life story. The Palin of America by Heart is the Palin who appears on Fox News from her home studio overlooking Lake Lucille, who gives lengthy speeches about freedom at Tea Party rallies, whose tweets get more attention than entire books by Mitt Romney. What do we learn that we didn't know before? We have a longer version of her reading list. The chapters of America by Heart consist of thoughts from Palin, excerpts from articles or speeches she likes, more thoughts from Palin, and occasionally some reminders of how she really hasn't gotten over the 2008 campaign. ""Remember the 2001 interview about the Constitution by then-Illinois state senator Barack Obama that surfaced during the 2008 campaign?"" She then rehashes an idea she's repeated on her Tea Party tour. When Obama argued that ""the Constitution is a charter of negative liberties,"" she says, he was accidentally describing why he wasn't fit to govern. ""The epitome of progressive thinking,"" writes Palin, ""was Barack Obama's promise just before the 2008 election, that 'we are five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America.' "" Palin's ""rogue"" moments that the media dismissed as weird, out-of-context attacks on Obama in 2008 are now part of the Tea Party's catechism. She even makes multiple references to ""clinging,"" in case anyone forgot that Obama once belittled guns and religion. Nothing that's happened since the campaign seems to have inspired her as much. A strange literary tic of America by Heart recurs whenever Palin starts to describe her life since leaving the governorship of Alaska. She sets a scene, describes how she got there, and then--moves on. Her run-ins with real Americans are less opportunities to tell readers what those Americans think than occasions to tell us how deeply she understands them. ""We've visited Walter Reed Hospital to meet mighty warriors,"" writes Palin, ""and I've twice visited Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, where wounded troops from Iraq and Afghanistan receive treatment."" The reader knows what's coming next. Palin, the world's most famous holder of a degree in journalism, will introduce those warriors. She pivots immediately. ""Just before my visit,"" she writes, ""my brother sent me a description of the American military man that I think is spot-on--with the exception that it doesn't include American military women."" There follow 19 paragraphs reprinting the entire letter, versions of which can be found in any number of places online. The mighty warriors retreat into the scenery, but Palin really, really appreciated them. And the whole book is like this. Palin is not living a celebrity's life, you silly liberals--she is living the life of the mind. She is reading books by conservatives on topics that interested her and giving HarperCollins the chance to reprint chunks of them. ""Reading about the faith roots of America in Matthew Spalding's book  We Still Hold These Truths,"" she writes, ""I learned that, from the very beginning, our Founders expressed a profound belief in religious tolerance."" Later, she cites Newt Gingrich's book Rediscovering God in America. She cites not just Milton Friedman, but libertarian godfather Leonard Read. If it starts to read like one of William Bennett's primers, she's got that covered, because she cites his The American Patriot's Almanac and writes that Bennett is ""a pretty great patriot himself."" This is Palin's game: She wants the lamestream media to make fun of her clip file. She remembers that during a family trip, ""all we had for entertainment was each other and a pile of Reader's Digests,"" a sparkly wink at Ronald Reagan and the way the press derided his intelligence over his love for that magazine. But did Reagan ever seem to be trying too hard? More relevant to her political hopes, does Barack Obama? Palin's publishing strategy mirrors Obama's, after all. He followed a memoir with a travelogue-cum-policy book; she's doing the same thing. The woman who rocked the Xcel Center, deriding Obama by saying ""the American presidency is not a journey of personal discovery,"" is well into her second year of a journey--and journal--of personal discovery, free of responsibility, with lots of time to collect insights that other people can use. By the end of the book, those insights work the way a John Cage composition works: You have to hear what isn't there. The few passages in which Palin expresses sympathy with Obama concern big problems that cannot be disposed of by quoting Whittaker Chambers. In discussing the BP spill--one of the few actual news events of the past year mentioned here--Palin  homes in on the press conference in which Obama said his daughter had asked him, ""Did you plug the hole yet, Daddy?""* ""Who among us hasn't had the experience of a simple question from an innocent child bringing our ego crashing back to earth?"" writes Palin. ""Of course Malia's daddy hadn't 'plugged the hole'--because doing so was beyond his capability, even as the most powerful man in the world."" At the time the spill was occurring--Obama's press conference was in May--Palin didn't say much more than this. In a famously awkward interview with Bill O'Reilly, she responded to a specific question about what the country needed to do by saying ""we need to make sure that all technology is being thrown at this problem."" Pressed by O'Reilly, she complained: ""We haven't had the assurance by the president that that has been his top priority. Instead, what his top priority is, Bill, is cap and tax."" Basically, she had nothing. She knew what she didn't like about Obama, she knew what other people didn't like, and she knew her principles, but the details of what government should do--well, that was tricky. Next question? Reading this book, which has a first run of 1 million copies, it's clear that since the wonderful experience of becoming a celebrity and the traumatic experience of losing to Obama/Biden, she hasn't had much to say. She will have plenty of time to say it. Corrections,  Nov. 24, 2010: The original version of this article referred to Todd Palin's participation in the Iditarod sled dog race.

7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/nice_posture.html	"The looming ""debate"" over whether to raise the debt ceiling beyond $14.3 trillion is not a debate in the typical sense, in which one side argues for the wisdom of a policy and the other argues against it. Rather, it's a debate like that between a hostage negotiator and a suicide bomber. Unless the negotiator agrees to the bomber's demands, the bomber will take out the negotiator and everyone else with him. The bombers, in this case, are Republican freshmen, who don't even take office until next year. Many incoming GOPers attacked their opponents during the 2010 campaign for voting to raise the debt ceiling, arguing that such a move allows out-of-control government spending. Now that stance has put them in a bind: Do they stick with their principles and vote against raising the ceiling--which could shut down the government when Uncle Sam can't pay his bills--or compromise and get labeled as flip-floppers? (A vote on raising the debt ceiling is likely in February.) Sen.-elect * Mike  Lee of Utah, for one, isn't budging. ""I'm going to vote against raising the national debt ceiling,"" he told Larry Kudlow on CNBC. ""We simply can't continue to mortgage the future of our unborn children and grandchildren."" Rep.-elect Bill Johnson of Ohio is also opposed: ""Most of us agreed that to increase the limit would be a betrayal of what we told voters we would do."" Republican Sens. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Jim DeMint of South Carolina pledge to vote against raising the ceiling unless it's coupled with a spending cut. The Republican leadership, meanwhile, isn't so hot on the idea. ""We're going to have to deal with it as adults,"" incoming Speaker of the House John Boehner told the Wall Street Journal. ""Whether we like it or not, the federal government has obligations, and we have obligations on our part."" The possible showdown between Democrats and Republicans--not to mention within the GOP--prompted Alan Simpson, co-chair of the president's bipartisan deficit commission, to gleefully predict a ""bloodbath."" Simpson said he hopes the fight forces Democrats to accept some of the commission's deficit-reducing recommendations. Why the disagreement among Republicans? Perhaps the elders have learned their lesson. In 1996, Boehner, then a freshman, led the last budget showdown between a Republican Congress and a Democratic president. When the parties came to an impasse, Boehner blamed Clinton: ""We have offered to work with the president to avert this crisis,"" he said. ""But so far, all we have gotten are excuses."" Everyone remembers the outcome of that gambit. The new Republican majority refused to raise the debt ceiling. President Clinton refused to meet GOP demands, which included eliminating the Commerce Department. The government shut down. Newt Gingrich made an unwise comment about how Clinton had once made him sit at the back of an airplane. Voters blamed Republicans for the crisis. Clinton was re-elected. What would happen if Republicans forced another shutdown? This time would be worse. The administration would have to come up with $1.4 trillion in savings to make up for the budget shortfall. With a total annual budget of $3.8 trillion, that would entail a budgetary massacre. Treasury would be unable to sell more bonds, driving the already vulnerable bond market haywire. Investors could also take it as a sign that the United States is unable to repay its debt. And as in 1996, voters could blame Republicans. Odds are we won't get there. The most likely result is a face-saving compromise. Democrats agree to a trim here, a cut there. Republicans declare victory. Everyone votes to raise the debt limit. Nothing changes. The irony is that both sides want to reduce the deficit--or at least say they do. But refusing to raise the debt ceiling is a terrible way to get there. Sure, self-appointed deficit hawks will extract a few minor budgetary concessions. But that will build up the kind of partisan resentment that makes a larger-scale, sustainable solution--like the one soon to be proposed by the Simpson-Bowles commission--impossible. If Simpson wants his reforms to pass, maybe he shouldn't be looking forward to a ""bloodbath"" but instead should be trying to avoid one.

8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/forget_tax_simplification.html	"Tax simplification is back in vogue among right-thinking people. On Nov. 10, former Sen. Alan Simpson, a Republican, and Erskine Bowles, former chief of staff to President Clinton, released a draft proposal that they're trying to sell to members of a bipartisan deficit-reduction panel created by President Obama. Chairmen Bowles and Simpson floated the idea of replacing the current six income-tax brackets with three, dropping the top marginal rate (applied to family income above $363,650) from the current 35 percent to 24 percent. Bowles and Simpson also floated a variation previously proposed by Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Judd Gregg, R-N.H., that would replace the current structure with three brackets but would keep the top rate at 35 percent. On Nov. 17 a different bipartisan deficit-reduction panel, chaired by former Sen. Pete Domenici, a Republican, and Alice Rivlin, former budget director to President Clinton, released its own report. Domenici and Rivlin propose to replace the current six brackets with two, dropping the top marginal rate to 27 percent. Perhaps you're wondering why two separate deficit commissions would choose to tackle the deficit by lowering the top tax rate (or at best maintaining it) rather than raising it. The answer has more to do with politics than economics. The idea is to con voters into thinking they're getting a tax cut when in fact they're getting a tax increase through the elimination of various ""tax expenditures"" (i.e., deductions and exemptions). All these proposals would, for instance, either limit or eliminate the popular mortgage interest deduction. Lowering tax rates to draw attention away from the elimination of tax expenditures was the strategy of the 1986 tax reform bill. That bill was also sold as tax simplification, since it replaced the existing 14 rates with five (dropping the top rate from 50 percent to 38.5 percent) and eventually with two (with a top rate of 28 percent). In the 1990s and aughts, two brackets became three, then five, and finally six.I'm all for eliminating wasteful tax expenditures. But eliminating them in exchange for lower rates and fewer brackets makes a lot less sense today than it did in 1986 because circumstances have changed in two important ways. First and most obviously, such a swap isn't nearly so good a deal when the top rate starts out pretty low. In 1986 the top rate was 50 percent. Today the top rate is 35 percent. And if the Bush tax cut is allowed to expire for top incomes (as appears unlikely, at least in the near term), the top rate will rise to 39.6 percent. Even 39.6 percent is low compared with the top rate for most of the income tax's 97-year history. The top rate stood at or above 90 percent between 1944 and 1963. President Kennedy dropped it to 77 percent and then 70 percent, where it remained until 1982, when President Reagan dropped it to 50 percent and then (under the 1986 tax reform) to the aforementioned 38.5 percent and 28 percent. (The first President Bush and President Clinton nosed it back up, first to 31 percent and then to the now-intolerable 39.6 percent, which Bush fils dropped to the present 35 percent.) Maybe you feel we should write the high rates off as an aberration of the socialist New Deal and its four-decade aftermath. But from 1920 to 1924 the top marginal rate was 73 percent, then 58 percent, then 46 percent. For most of that time the president was Republican Warren G. Harding! Today, combined U.S. taxes at the federal, state, and local level are lower than they are in virtually the entire developed world. A 2008 survey of member countries by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ranked the U.S. two notches from the bottom; only Turkey and Mexico had a lower combined tax rate. The second circumstance that's changed since 1986 is income distribution. As I pointed out in my Slate series, ""The Great Divergence,"" incomes have grown dramatically less equal since 1979. There are various reasons for this, most of which I won't get into because they're explained in the series. But one very significant reason, especially since the early 1990s, has been a stunning increase in incomes at the top of the income scale. This was first documented by economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez in 2003  (see chart above); Saez updated the figures this past July. Since 1979, the share of national income going to the top 0.1 percent (people making more than about $1 million in current dollars) has essentially quadrupled, from about 2 percent to about 8 percent. Let me say that again: About 8 percent of all the income earned in the United States goes to people making $1 million or more. These people don't need tax simplification. They need tax complication: more brackets at higher rates. The current system of tax brackets is faulty, just like the reformers say it is. But the problem isn't too many tax brackets. It's too few. The income-tax structure we have today is built on the quaint assumption that people earning in excess of $363,650 constitute a single wealthy class. But what Piketty and Saez demonstrated was that this group in fact encompasses a hierarchy of wealthy people whose incomes, like those of the general population, have grown less equal than they were 30 years ago, or even 24 years ago. Here's how James Surowiecki, using the same Piketty-Saez data (and drawing the same conclusion I am here) put it in an August column for the New Yorker: ""[A]t the same time that the rich have been pulling away from the middle class, the very rich have been pulling away from the pretty rich, and the very, very rich have been pulling away from the very rich."" We need at least a couple of new higher-percentage brackets above the current highest bracket to acknowledge this reality. It simply isn't fair to treat a family earning $363,650 the same as a family making $1 million. Such families barely live on the same planet. Which isn't to say that the family earning $363,650 deserves a tax cut. It is merely to say that the family earning $1 million should pay more than 35 or even 39.6 percent, and that a family earning $10 million should pay at an even higher tax rate. Stepping it up gradually to a maximum rate of 70 percent would probably cause mass hysteria, at least in the Fox newsroom, but under Nixon and Ford, you paid that much if you earned about $200,000 (the equivalent of somewhere between $800,000 and about $1 million in current dollars). Today that group pays a top marginal tax that's half what it was back then. By all means, let's eliminate wasteful tax expenditures from the U.S. income-tax system. I'd even favor eliminating the mortgage-interest deduction (though perhaps not at this precise moment, given the perilous state of the housing market). But please, let's hear no more talk about reducing the number of tax brackets. We need more tax brackets, and higher ones, for the rich, richer, and richest. They can afford it.

9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/bestlaid_plans.html	"While there may be a growing deficit, there's certainly no deficit of deficit commissions. The co-chairs of the president's commission unveiled a preliminary plan last week, as did the Peterson-Pew Commission on Budget Reform. Rep. Jan Schakowsky announced her own plan Tuesday. And on Wednesday, the Bipartisan Policy Center's deficit reduction ""task force,"" led by former Sen. Pete Domenici and former White House budget director Alice Rivlin, added its plan to the pile. What all these plans have in common is that none of them brings deficit reduction any closer to reality. The president's commission, co-chaired by former Clinton adviser Erskine Bowles and former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson, offered a painful mix of spending cuts and tax hikes but doesn't have the authority to bind Congress. Schakowsky's plan, which focuses mostly on tax hikes and cuts to the military, is just that: Schakowsky's plan. And while the Rivlin-Domenici task force (Rivlin is also on the presidential task force) presents some original ideas, it doesn't have a single member who currently holds elective office. ""We all know we've talked about this problem for long enough,"" said former Sen. Tom Daschle in his introductory remarks at the rollout at the Newseum in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. ""It's time for action. ... The choices will not be easy. But it can be done, as this task force shows."" Not really. What the task force shows is that 19 business leaders and former politicians without much stake in outcomes can agree on a hypothetical plan. Just because they can doesn't mean Congress can. The key to deficit reduction is finding the right balance of goodies for each side--a tax hike for you, a spending cut for you, and so on. The Rivlin-Domenici plan would start with a $650 billion stimulus in the form of a one-year payroll tax holiday. It would then impose a five-year freeze on discretionary spending and simplify the tax code, including reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 27 percent and imposing a 6.5 percent sales tax. Another chunk of savings would come from capping Medicare benefits, scrapping the tax exclusion on employer-provided health care, getting rid of the ""doc fix,"" and implementing tort reform. And instead of raising the retirement age, the plan would incentivize people to keep working by paying out greater benefits if they retire later. All of which seem like perfectly sound policy ideas. They avoid the regressive tax structure of the Simpson-Bowles plan yet acknowledge that not all savings can come from raising taxes, as Schakowsky largely proposes. The problem is in the process. Members of the committee kept reiterating that Congress and the president would have to show ""leadership."" ""This can be solved by bipartisan input if leaders want to,"" said Domenici. ""And if they decide it's better to save the country instead of saving their political future."" Rivlin emphasized that President Obama needs to make deficit reduction a priority. Frank Keating, a commission member and former Republican governor of Oklahoma, made a perfectly reasonable statement that highlighted why the plan is unlikely to become law. ""This is a consensus document, but that doesn't mean we all agree on every bit,"" he said, adding: ""For me as a conservative, I didn't win every battle, but much of this is excellent public policy."" It's hard to imagine the same statement coming from a current Republican member of Congress. Rivlin has been here before. ""Lest you feel too hopeless, I'm older than you guys, and I was around the last time we balanced the budget,"" she told a group of reporters. ""That was very contentious. We did raise taxes and held the line on spending for a very long time."" This fight will be a lot tougher than 1995, though. Back then, all Congress needed to do was bring annual revenue in line with annual spending. But now long-term deficit growth is baked into the cake. Even if Congress doesn't touch Medicare or Social Security, the debt will rise. Education is a major component of any solution, said Rivlin. ""Maybe now that we've had an election very focused on the debt and deficit problem, the public will begin to understand how serious this is,"" she said. It's true, candidates talked a lot about deficit reduction in 2010--but only in the vaguest terms. Few uttered specifics about how to reduce the deficit, lest their opponent use their words against them. Plus, many Americans seem to want deficit reduction but not any reduction in entitlements--hence the famous refrain, ""Get your government hands off my Medicare."" Deficit reduction, while popular in general terms, is unpopular in its specifics. What will it take to get politicians to risk their political futures for their country's future? Judging by Domenici's words, the answer is fear. ""The American people face a quiet killer that is eating away at the foundation of America,"" he said. ""This is a quiet killer that will eat us alive."" Americans just have to start caring enough to make politicians think that if they don't try to cut the deficit, it will eat their political careers, too. Like Slate on  Facebook.

10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/permanently_confusing.html	"The debate over extending the Bush tax cuts has entered a new phase, at least metaphorically: It used to be a hostage crisis. Now it's a game of chicken. Before the election, President Obama said Republicans were holding middle-class tax cuts hostage: Everyone gets a tax cut or no one does. It was a dramatic analogy, but it had a political flaw: Democrats were watching the windows and blocking the doors. There was enough Democratic support for the GOP position that congressional leaders didn't dare risk a vote. Now the election is over, and the expiration date for the tax cuts is weeks away. If nothing is done by the end of the year, the Bush cuts self-destruct, as they were designed to, and everyone's taxes go up. The parties are at odds on how to solve this problem. But as the cars head toward each other, at the moment only the White House looks as if it's going to swerve. It looks that way because the president has not been as definitive as the Republicans have been. Obama would like a permanent extension of the tax cuts for the middle class (defined as families making $250,000 or less per year) and would accept a temporary one for those making more than $250,000. The Republican position is that the tax cuts should be extended for everyone for the same period of time. If not, they won't vote for anything. And the Republicans have said they're willing to crash their car if they don't get what they want. Taxes would increase for everyone. Those who get a paycheck would see the first one of 2011 shrink. Why hasn't the president said the same thing? Because for months he has not been able to make Republicans pay for obstruction. No matter whose fault it is, he'll get the blame if there's an accident. The main dispute surrounds the issue of splitting the tax cuts. The White House hopes to separate the popular middle-class tax cuts, which they would like to be permanent, from the less popular ones for the wealthy, which they would like to be temporary. In the future debate over shrinking the deficit, when the hunt for budget savings is even more acute than today, it will be easier for a politician to let the temporary rate for the wealthy expire to bring in more revenue than to do so by casting a vote to increase that tax rate. Republicans, for their part, once pushed for a permanent extension of all cuts but have since come around to the idea of a temporary extension of all tax cuts. Sen. Jim DeMint has said he'd go for that if it's all he can get. This is an echo of what incoming House Speaker John Boehner said in September. What they haven't come around on, however, is the issue of separating the tax cuts into middle-class and for-the-rich versions. ""We would be foolish to fall for it,""  said the incoming chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Dave Camp. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Boehner feel the same way. That the White House is even contemplating a temporary extension of the tax breaks for those families that make more than $250,000 is something new, though you'd be forgiven if you were confused about what exactly the president believed. Last week, White House adviser David Axelrod told the Huffington Post that the president was prepared to negotiate with Republicans on tax cuts for the wealthy that he once opposed. This seemed pretty obvious from the president's news conference after the election, but saying it out loud caused an uproar. Democrats were angry at Axelrod on tactical and political grounds. Progressives wanted a fight that framed the GOP as the party that only cares about millionaires and billionaires. Tacticians wanted the president's team to take a harder line. By threatening to refuse to accept even a temporary extension of tax cuts for those making more than $250,000, Obama would be in a position to win concessions from Republicans. On Fox News Sunday this week, Axelrod sounded as if he had backed off his comments, saying the president had not changed his position. ""We cannot afford to go the additional step and permanently cut taxes primarily for millionaires and billionaires at a cost of $700 billion for the next 10 years alone,"" he said. Sounds definitive--but the word ""permanently"" gives him away. Not so long ago, the idea of extending the tax cuts to the wealthy, even temporarily, was out of bounds in the White House. In early September, former Obama budget director Peter Orszag wrote a column in the New York Times suggesting that the president should embrace a short-term extension of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy. This drew a  rebuke from the podium by Press Secretary Robert Gibbs.  Treasury Secretary Geithner also spoke against it, arguing that a temporary extension was just a ploy in advance of making the cuts permanent. A couple of months ago, when John Boehner said he would accept a two-year extension, the president  accused him of trying to hold the middle class hostage. Now that Obama has bent a little, must he buckle all the way and accept the GOP position? Not necessarily. By looking open to GOP ideas, moderating his stance on tax breaks for the wealthy, and hosting GOP leaders at the White House, the president appears chastened and accommodating. If a bill comes to the floor of the House and Senate extending the tax cuts for everyone, can Republicans really vote against that simply because they don't like the fact that the tax cuts for the rich will expire? The country is not in love with the GOP. Not taking yes for an answer would be risky. The problem for the president is the one he had before the election: He might lose Democratic senators like Evan Bayh of Indiana, Ben Nelson of Nebraska, Kent Conrad of North Dakota, or Independent Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, who will vote with Republicans. Progressive Democrats, meanwhile, are working at cross purposes with the president. They would like a fight. They already think Obama has compromised too much by even entertaining the idea of a limited extension of the tax cut for upper-income families. They've called on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to block any proposal to do so. Labor leaders are calling for a similar strategy. Senate Democratic aides say a bill that extended current rates only for the lower brackets would not pass in the Senate. Given that reality, the White House shows no appetite for this kind of symbolic fight, at least right now. The general view is that the president and Republicans will ultimately agree to extend all cuts for a few years. One administration official argues that there will be plenty of time to brawl with Republicans next year. In the meantime, the president wants to remind independent voters that he is closer to the man they voted for in 2008 and that he is at least trying to work with the other side, as they say they want him to. Two Democratic senators have tried to change the dynamic by offering a compromise approach. Chuck Schumer of New York has suggested  increasing the income level for extending the tax cuts from $250,000 to $1 million. The White House and a number of Democratic Senators don't like that idea, because at that income level, they can no longer claim that the cuts are for the middle class, a term that has some power in political fights. Mark Warner of Virginia has offered a plan that would not extend the rates for the wealthy in exchange for targeted tax cuts for business. The plan has no GOP support yet, and while some Democratic officials like it, the details are too complicated to work out in the brief lame-duck session. (Congress leaves town for the week of Thanksgiving and then comes back for only a few weeks in December before heading home for good.) The president had planned to discuss extending the Bush tax cuts when he met with Democratic and Republican Congressional leaders Thursday, but Republican leaders had scheduling conflicts. The meeting is now scheduled for Nov. 30. That would leave just a couple of weeks for the president and the GOP to make a deal before Congress is scheduled to go home.

11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/listen_to_me_barack.html	"On Friday, the Washington Post published the worst column of the year. It's been a long year, and a stupid year, so this is no light accusation. And pollster-pundits Doug Schoen and Pat Caddell write a lot of bad columns --they are good ways to spend the slow hours between Fox and Friends and Hannity, more productive than knitting or Sudoku. Still, the hackwork in their call for President Obama to retire after one term was something special. How can we judge this? A typical Post column may get a few hundred comments, a few hundred recommendations on Facebook. George Will's bitter I-told-you-so about the Chevy Volt, for example, has inspired around 700 ""likes"" on Facebook. Caddell and Schoen have inspired almost 5,000 ""likes"" and almost 2,000 comments (and counting), in what has become the paper's most-read piece of the day. Undoubtedly they've inspired some smaller number of TV producers to book ""One and Done"" segments, even though no one buys the Schoen/Caddell argument that Obama could achieve more by declaring himself a lame duck. Byron York, the Washington Examiner's chief political correspondent, makes the obvious point that an Obama retirement would broadcast ""fatal weakness,"" a surrender to an opposition party that's materially weaker than those faced by Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan at this point in their presidencies. Ah, but no editor wants columns that make obvious points! This is the paradox of the opinion industry: If it sounds stupid, it leads. If it's counterintuitive, it's surely because the columnist has found a fresh angle on a mundane problem, and this angle will produce insights. Data is unexciting, especially if it's the same data everyone else has. Discussions of fantasy scenarios that could prove your theories right? Exciting! So before anyone else tries, here are six ridiculous ideas for opinion columns on how Obama can rescue his presidency. How Obama Can Win by Leaving the Democratic PartyThe pitch: None of the Republicans who may run for president in 2012 has the personal appeal of Barack Obama. His most credible opponent, Mitt Romney, will be hamstrung by his support of a very ObamaCare-esque health care law in Massachusetts. His less credible opponents, like Sarah Palin, trail him in the polls. His biggest threat might come in the form of a Michael Bloomberg vanity campaign. (This may not seem like a threat if you are a political consultant who enjoys getting paid.) So: Cut everyone off at the pass and run as an independent, Republican, or write-in candidate. The lede: ""In 2004, Barack Obama caught the nation's attention with a speech that convinced Americans he didn't see a difference between red states and blue states. Six years later, there's a way he can prove it."" How Obama Can--and Must--Give the Presidency to Nancy PelosiThe pitch: The most successful progressive politician of the last 50 years is the outgoing speaker of the House. Liberals like her and trust her. They're told that they're going to lose the White House in two years anyway. So: Get Obama and Biden to resign their offices by January, and she takes over. The lede: ""The discussion among Democrats right now is whether to replace Nancy Pelosi with another, less liberal candidate to lead the party in the House. That's exactly the wrong discussion to have. Liberals should be asking how they can promote her.""Obama Must Cancel the KSM Trial and Kill Him With His Bare HandsThe pitch: Voters see the president as too soft on terrorism. So do our allies. Really, the rest of this column writes itself, especially if there are 700 or 800 words to get deep into the details. The lede: ""George W. Bush had his bullhorn moment. Barack Obama can have his own bullhorn moment. It could rescue his presidency--but only if he's willing to get his hands dirty."" Obama Must Relocate the White House to the HeartlandThe pitch: The president's lost touch with voters and become part of the all-absorbing swamp that voters can't stand. The solution: Move government operations to Iowa or Nebraska, preferably in sight of a state fairground and at least one Wal-Mart. The lede: ""Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign was based in Chicago, not Washington, putting his advisers' heads in the Midwest instead of in Washington. The trick to his political recovery--and ours--is figuring out how to do that permanently."" Obama Can Win in 2012 if He Changes His Last Name to DunhamThe pitch: The president's tripped up whenever he's reminded voters of his race--the Henry Louis Gates arrest, the revelation of his iPod playlists--and he's lost support with white voters who chose him in greater numbers than they chose John Kerry or Al Gore. The solution: Adopting his mother's family name and embracing whiteness, which appeals to at least 77 percent of the electorate. The lede: ""Before 2008, few people thought an African-American could be president. Maybe he can only be elected once."" Why Obama Needs a New First LadyThe pitch: To win re-election, Barack Obama must divorce his wife and find a new spouse more likely to win over the voters Democrats have started to lose. These include white voters, people over 60, and people who like Cindy McCain. The lede: ""Barack Obama doesn't have a first lady with the appeal and the immunity to gaffes of Laura Bush or Lady Bird Johnson. But he could.""

12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/the_peterson_principle.html	"You win, Pete Peterson. I'm writing about you. The $6 million you're spending on your latest campaign will not be wasted. You are getting Media Attention. This piece can be printed out and put in a binder, which can then be used to gain further Media Attention. I can't ignore this campaign because it's so obvious and pandering. It is called ""OweNo,"" with the ""o"" in ""no"" actually designed as red ""no"" symbol, as in ""No smoking"" or ""No shirts, No shoes, No service."" It's ostensibly a vehicle for the presidential campaign of Hugh Jidette, whose name is supposed to (but doesn't quite) sound like ""huge debt,"" who promises to spend lots of money without raising taxes, and who launched his campaign to a cheering crowd of fellow actors who really needed the work. And so it's a ploy to promote the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, which is scheduled to release its recommendations for a long-term debt reduction plan by Dec. 1. We are at ""a unique, historic moment in American politics,"" Peterson said today. ""I heard the voters say, enough is enough,"" said Peterson. ""Enough of the bluffing. Enough of the meaningless generalities that obscure more than they reveal."" What is OweNo about, if not generalities? Sure, discussing the national debt is more serious than, say, discussing the possible career moves of South Carolina stunt candidate Alvin Greene. But the great debt debate has been defined by big, terrifying numbers and the old reliable fear of foreigners overtaking the United States. In one of the phony ads OweNo cut for ""Jidette,"" for example, a worried-looking woman says that ""foreign lenders"" have our money. How to get it back? Beat up this strawman! Peterson is succeeding in scaring liberals with this stuff, and succeeding in the more important task of giving the small number of Democrats who want entitlement cuts some cover. At the launch Evan Bayh of Indiana, whose sense of responsibility did not prevent him from retiring from the Senate this year, contemplated the Jidette ads and mused, ""The election a week ago today would have been a lot more edifying if we had more commercials like that than the ones running in the various states."" And he briefly ignored Peterson's advice about generalities to muse a little about the debt. ""It really is an existential threat to our country,"" said Bayh. ""It's important to our very freedom. It is impossible for a country to be head over heels in debt and yet retain its independence and freedom of action."" If Peterson can't get politicians to be specific about spending cuts at his own Potemkin campaign event, when can he? Maybe when the commission issues its report he can push the political consensus toward entitlement cuts. But how is yet another round of generic bellyaching about the debt likely to make that happen? Every election cycle--and yes, we are now in the 2012 election cycle--is cursed with organizations like this. They try to manufacture the conventional wisdom by being bland and talking about the need for politicians to start doing important things, without ever saying what those things are. In the 2008 cycle, the serious organizations that just wanted dialogue were mostly liberal-leaning groups. A coalition that included the AARP, SEIU, and Business Roundtable ran Divided We Fail; the SEIU managed the Health Care for America Now project. Both organizations made their presence felt wherever they knew politicians would be. And both were gloriously, thoroughly bland. They favored solutions! They favored compromise! But Divided We Fail, especially, campaigned on ideas, not outcomes. Health Care for America Now had a set of 10 principles that candidates were encouraged to endorse, which is more than Peterson's stunt campaign is asking. The theory behind both these efforts was to put on acts bland and subtle enough that the political class eventually got behind the liberal policies they really supported. ""It was a bank shot,"" explained Eliseo Medina, secretary-treasurer of the SEIU, one of the players in both of 2008's nebulous liberal groups. ""You play pool, right? Sometimes you don't hit something directly--that's not the best way to get what you want. You educate the public and urge people to act, and then the groups that are more oriented toward the policy goals can act. If you get bogged down in details you may never get there."" The bland, do-something approach did get the liberals' big priority--health care--into the discussion. The lack of real policy demands came back to haunt them. Once the health care debate began, it was the accounts of the Congressional Budget Office and the activists with specific demands and problems--cost, mandates, premium levels--that controlled a debate that Democrats barely won. ""It was a success that we managed to get health care reform,"" said Medina, ""as imperfect as it is."" But that success cost Democrats a lot of blood. Setting up health care as an issue that good people could come together on gained the Democrats nothing; it was an issue they needed to argue the finest points on. The same goes for Peterson and debt. The people who've actually proposed unpleasant solutions for cutting the deficit and paying back the debt have always defined the debate. Ross Perot's 1992 presidential campaign, the high point of debt fear-mongering, was a cavalcade of charts and tax increases and spending cuts. Glenn Beck's current information campaign, widely misunderstood by liberals, is laying the groundwork for hard cuts to entitlement spending. He knows, and Perot knew, that no one wins this argument by simply calling for a debate. The winner shifts the Overton Window. The winner makes it possible to discuss politically painful solutions. The losers? If history is any guide, they're the ones who team up with Evan Bayh. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/miss_him_yet.html	"The two-year Democratic campaign to remind voters of the nightmare of the presidency of George W. Bush did not succeed. Need proof? Look to Arkansas. That's where the GOP took over most of the congressional delegation for the first time since 1964 and did it with a first-time candidate named Tim Griffin. If Griffin's name sparks something in your memory, it should. He spent the aughts working for Bush, for the campaign and the administration. In 2006, the Justice Department accepted the resignation of seven U.S. attorneys; the replacements were more ideologically simpatico, and people noticed. Griffin got one of the plum jobs, but he resigned after six months with a speech worthy of Jerry Maguire in its angry bridge-burning. Public service, said Griffin, was ""not worth it."" And now he's going to be a member of the House of Representatives.  He drubbed State Sen. Joyce Elliott by 20 points in what, on paper, should be the most Democratic district in Arkansas. * Elliott tried to drape Bush around Griffin's shoulders, especially his involvement--still much disputed--with the Bush re-election campaign's effort to ""cage"" voter registrations by sending first-class mail to their addresses and seeing if it bounced back. ""It was not hard to explain,"" she told me, reflecting on the race. ""It was absolutely out there. But it absolutely did not take hold with people.""  Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington dubbed Griffin one of the ""Crooked Candidates of 2010."" Griffin simply called CREW a ""fringe left-wing group,"" and newspapers thwacked Elliott for harping on her opponent's past. Elliott attacked Griffin over the ""caging"" scandal, so he said she wanted to ""make this election about defending ACORN."" She fired her guns; the bullets bounced like rubber. George W. Bush's memoir hits bookstores tomorrow morning, and there's hardly a hint of controversy about it. Two new movies dramatize the scandals of Bush's agonizing second term: the Valerie Plame/Joe Wilson drama, Fair Game, and the Jack Abramoff farce, Casino Jack. Both have marquee casts, and the first has Oscar buzz. But neither is generating much popular interest or reflection. If anything, they miss out on two trends of the midterms: Bush nostalgia and Bush denialism. The two traits are inseperable. The man left office with an approval rating stuck below 30 percent, while he'd matched the intense unpopularity of the departing Richard Nixon in 1974. Now according to a pre-election poll by Doug Schoen, the Clinton pollster who has spent the last two years jousting with Doug Rasmussen for the job of chief Obama doomsayer, 48 percent of voters feel that Bush was a better president than Obama. Only 43 percent of voters felt the opposite way. But this is not why Republicans won last week. An NBC News poll from September revealed that 62 percent of voters disliked Bush's economic policies. That was the number on which the Democrats were banking their fall campaign. That was what Barack Obama's Parable of the Slurpee, his tale of how Republicans figuratively enjoyed an iced beverage while the Democrats tried to push the economy out of a figurative ditch, was supposed to exploit. It didn't work, obviously. In that same September poll lies a clue as to why: Voters did not like Bush's economic policies, but neither did they believe Bush's party would return to them. Fifty-eight percent of voters said they believed that the new breed of Republicans (like Tim Griffin, we assume) would not go back to Bush's policies. So voters punished Democrats even though, according to the midterm national exit poll, only 23 percent of them blamed Obama for ""economic problems,"" while 29 percent blamed Bush, and 35 percent blamed Wall Street. One explanation for all this may be that Bush isn't thought of as a failed president or a misunderstood Truman-esque success. He's just not thought of, period. The defining events of his presidency--the war on terror and the economic crisis--don't really belong to him, because Obama has presided over them, and the public doesn't register much of a change in how they're being handled. The scandals, meanwhile, intrigued the public up to the moment that they were turned into screenplays, at which point they stopped mattering. Can Bush nostalgia/denial be blamed on Obama? That's a stretch--all of his problems begin, and most of them end, with the crippling unemployment rate he inherited from Bush. But as baffling as this is for liberals, it's not clear to the median voter how much he traded in when he got rid of Bush. Reagan's presidency represented open and total war on the entirety of the Carter presidency. Obama's presidency has had the trappings of conflict and the reality of continuation. Look at the anger at Bush's scandals--U.S. attorneys, Plame, all things Iraq, and the so-called ""black sites"" for interrogation. There was the war on terror and the prosecution of it. Obama's feints at a break from Bush have come as he's basically continued his predecessor's policies. (Somebody stop John Bolton and tell him.) It was Jan. 23, 2009, for example, when Obama ordered the closure of the prison at Gitmo within one year. The anger that defined Bush's final year, and the anger that sparked the Tea Party, was over his handling of the economy. As far as most Americans know, Obama didn't change direction on that. An August Pew poll had 47 percent of respondents believing that the universally despised TARP was Obama's project, to 34 percent who said it was Bush's. The Glenn Beckian cries of ""socialism"" get all the attention. The real reason that voters don't like Obama on the economy is that they think he coddles the banks, just like Bush did. But even if the anger at all of this is so dim, why don't Bush's scandals matter? Because they aren't remembered as significant scandals. Bush left office granting Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby a commutation, not a pardon, and Democrats opted not to listen to Sen. Patrick Leahy and not to obsess over the fading scandals. And so Griffin's past had no impact on his election. Clinton administration veterans, meanwhile, were less lucky. Clinton's penultimate chief of staff, Erskine Bowles, was felled in two U.S. Senate races in North Carolina for the crime of working for Bill Clinton during the Lewinsky scandal. And then there's the matter of what the Clinton scandals were about. ""There are certain aspects of the Clinton scandals, the Lewinsky story, that anyone on the street would remember,"" mused Paul Charlton, one of the ousted U.S. attorneys who is now in private practice in Arizona. ""Few remember the details of the scandals that truly caused people concern about Clinton. So maybe unless stories have that kind of appeal, they fade away after some period of time."" Is there any aspect of the Bush legacy that Democrats can use to hurt Republicans? The release of Bush's book may offer some hints. Or it may reveal that Democrats are in the same position they were in 1995, opposing and demonizing the current crop of Republicans while the old crop settles into a respectable new life. ""The Japanese have an expression,"" said Mark Green, the semiretired New York politician who co-wrote a book, published in 2004, about how bad Bush was. ""Nobody remembers anything after 30 days.""

14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/live_by_the_polls.html	"President Obama made his first big pitch under the new order yesterday. Today it was Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's turn. Whereas Obama looked for a middle ground where both parties could meet, McConnell looked for the president to come over to his side. As McConnell sees it, the election was a mandate for Obama to change course. What course will the Senate Republican leader follow? Simple: the will of the American people. ""Listening to the People Who Sent Us Here"" was the title of the speech he gave today at the Heritage Foundation. There's a problem, though: The American people don't really agree with him. McConnell is not one of the politicians who pretends not to read the polls. When he argued that Obama and Democrats were out of touch, he used polls to back up his argument. Using the McConnell standard--that is, reading the polls--the views of the people who gave the GOP such a resounding victory Tuesday do not match up with his priorities of cutting taxes, repealing health care, and reducing spending. Tax cuts: According to exit polls, only 17 percent of the country thinks tax cuts should be a priority for the new Congress. And those that do want tax cuts oppose the way McConnell wants to do it. More than half the country, 52 percent, either wants the Bush tax cuts extended for those making under $250,000 a year or doesn't want them extended at all. Only 39 percent support the McConnell position of extending the Bush tax cuts for everyone. That 52-39 split is identical to the one McConnell cited at the White House health care summit in February as proof that the American people opposed Obama's health care plan. Spending cuts: McConnell is opposed to federal spending to create jobs, but nearly as many voters want lawmakers to spend money to create jobs (37 percent) as want them to cut the deficit (39 percent). Voters in McConnell's home state of Kentucky are even more bullish on spending: They say Congress's first priority should be spending to create jobs (39 percent), reducing the deficit (35 percent), and applying tax cuts (21 percent). Health care: Voters do not list repeal of the health care as a top priority. When asked their opinion, 48 percent support McConnell's plan to repeal the law. This is hardly a mandate. Forty-seven percent want either to keep the law or to expand it. These are opinions of Tuesday's voters--the people McConnell cited in his speech today. Voter sentiment among the broader population is even more against him. In a recent USA Today/Gallup poll, a new stimulus bill is supported by 38 percent of the country. Cutting spending gets 24 percent support; repealing health care, 23 percent; and extending all income tax cuts, 8 percent. A possible response to all this, of course, is to say: Ignore the polls. That would undermine McConnell's case, but it's closer to the classic definition of leadership. None other than George W. Bush makes that case in his memoir Decision Points. Obama also made this claim when presented with polls that the country rejecting his stimulus and health care plans. In general, polls (and elections) present politicians with two choices. Either they can say they're going to follow the will of the American people as expressed in the polls (or at the ballot box) or they can say they're going to lead. They can't do both. There is a third option, of course. You can just claim that the American people agree with you regardless of whether they actually do or not. That's certainly a time-honored political technique. Unfortunately, it usually requires making things up. Polls show the American people don't like that. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter."

15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/12/the_states_that_can_say_no.html	"""How many of you know something about the Second Amendment?"" asked Randy Barnett. This was a rhetorical question. Barnett, the Georgetown law professor who has spent the last few years researching ways for states to opt out of federal mandates, was speaking to conservative state legislators gathered in Washington for the American Legislative Exchange Council's post-election meeting, and they were spending their third consecutive day boning up on federalism. In response to Barnett's question, every hand went up. No one had any questions about the right to bear arms. ""Well, the Article Five convention process is like a gun in the Constitution,"" he said. He's referring to how ""the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States"" are allowed to call conventions and propose amendments. ""It's a loaded gun, in the Constitution, put in the hands of state legislators to use for good and to use for ill."" The legislators nodded their heads and took notes. An Arizona state senator scribbled on the handout she got for the session: Art 5, 2/3 of states to propose. It wasn't a new idea, just one that has never been tried. According to Barnett, this was not because the convention was such an implausible idea. It was because the states hadn't ever been so threatened. ""Now, the question you have to ask yourself is: Are we living in a really happy, tranquil time where everything is going pretty well and we don't want to rock the boat, and therefore we don't want to pick up our guns? We want to keep them in the drawer because it's not time? Or are we living in a different time in which the federal government is coming at us with its constitutional powers as interpreted by the Supreme Court, and it's time to open up the drawer in which our Article Five powers are, and take that out, and start brandishing it to ward off the attack of the people who are trying to break into your homes? I think that time is now."" Last month, Republicans gained a majority of governorships, around 680 seats in state legislatures, and a record number of other statewide offices--attorneys general, secretaries of state. In some states, like New Hampshire, they have majorities large enough to override gubernatorial vetoes. Plenty of the new members won election on Tea Party platforms, promising to fight back against President Obama's army of Feds and their new regulations. But how can they do it? The mission of ALEC was to inform hundreds of state legislators (organizers wouldn't put a number on how many attended; there were about 50 at Barnett's workshop) what threats they were about to confront, how the Obama administration would try to slip past them, and how they could roll back or obliterate federal mandates. This was revelatory stuff for the legislators. Daniel Knodl, a second-term state assemblyman from Wisconsin, attended the conference with five of his 25 new Republican peers. The tips he was getting about how to challenge the federal government were new to all of them. Barnett's vision had been catching on, and some legislators had been aware of the law professor's proposed ""Repeal Amendment,"" but they were introduced for the first time to ideas like interstate compacts between states that refused to enforce health insurance mandates--compacts that could theoretically supersede laws passed by Congress. ""I'm not a constitutional scholar by any means,"" said Knodl. ""A lot of this is interesting to me. We're learning what power the states really have."" Are they learning about tactics that will actually work? The neo-nullification theories on display at ALEC aren't taken seriously by liberal constitutional scholars. On Friday, Ian Millhiser of the Center for American Progress rebutted the interstate-compact concept by pointing out that the Supreme Court, in  College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board, ruled that state compacts do, in fact, need the approval of Congress. That doesn't stop the conservative scholars from trying. At last week's event, Nick Dranias, director of the Center for Constitutional Government at Arizona's libertarian Goldwater Institute, told legislators to look at using local taxpayer courts to challenge federal laws. ""How many here would have liked taxpayers to get a crack at the GM bailout?"" he asked. ""I'm not promising you that cases like that are going to win, but I am saying you have better odds there than you have in state courts."" But asking whether these new ideas are feasible is almost beside the point. The first goal of the new legislators will be to do what Barnett was talking about: Make it clear, immediately, that Republican-run states won't accept subservience to the federal government. They'll do this at a time when a Republican-run House will not pass any new legislation to bail out state governments. In 2009, many Republicans in the states said they didn't want the obligations attached to stimulus or Medicare funds, but they were outnumbered and had to take it. The extra money won't be there in 2011; the old obligations will be ripe for attacking. It's not just Republicans who want to see how far this can go. At another event last week held in the bowels of another Washington hotel, Oregon's incoming Gov. John Kitzhaber was asked what, if anything, the new Tea Party-infused House of Representatives could do for Democrats. ""Now is the time for us to ask them to put their money where their mouths are,"" said Kitzhaber, flanked by other new Democratic governors, ""and provide states with some of the flexibility to innovate, without dealing with some of these antiquated regulations that don't make sense in the 21st century."" Kitzhaber is only adjusting to new terms. Barnett and the other conservative lawyers making their cases to the new class of elected Republicans are defining the terms. ""You have the ability to restrict yourselves from accepting conditional grants,"" Dranias told legislators. ""There's nothing that stops states from doing that. I'd suggest doing that in every state."" Several newly elected Republican lawmakers also wrote this down on their legal pads. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

Stepping off the stage Wednesday at a forum for candidates to replace RNC Chairman Michael Steele, Collins runs headlong into JoAnn Abbott, a Tea Party activist from Woodbridge, Va., who is sporting a hat with buttoned-on slogans like ""WAR never solved anything, except slavery, genocide, Nazism, and fascism."" Abbott pins Collins between herself and the Gadsden flag that has been put on the stage. ""About the RINOS,"" she says, referring to the members of the GOP whom conservatives consider Republicans In Name Only. ""Can we not give them as much money to run again? I mean, can we have a base, a base of funding support, and if they vote the wrong way, the next time that gets cut in half?"" ""Well--"" ""I want a litmus test!"" interrupts Abbott. ""Well,"" Collins says, restarting, ""one of the things you find--and a lot of people talk about a litmus test--is that the RNC doesn't actually fund many candidates. A lot of our donations are for party-building purposes."" He explains that her concerns about the RNC funding rotten candidates are admirable, but it's not really something the RNC does. He explains that the RNC did not fund Lisa Murkowksi's write-in bid or post-election legal actions. Abbott is placated somewhat. Collins is the former political director of the RNC who left his position, blasted Michael Steele's mismanagement, and then launched a bid to replace Steele, all in eight days. His presence at this forum--in fact, the existence of the forum itself, which is sponsored by the Tea Party group FreedomWorks--is the latest exhibit of the Tea Party's newfound power in the GOP. The thing is, neither Collins nor the seven other people who've said they're interested in this job need to win over Abbott. There are 168 voting members of the RNC, including the party chairs in all states and territories and the committeemen from those states and territories. To become chairman, a candidate just needs the support of a majority of them. That's it. Since 2008, the race for RNC chairman has become a conservative proxy fight over whatever, at the moment, is vexing conservatives. This is odd, because the RNC plays little to no role in internal debates among conservatives. It's become the fashion to blame Steele for everything--and this debate, which he didn't attend, comes the day before the release of an RNC financial report that will reveal exactly how much Republicans can blame him--so this, in part, can be blamed on him, too. After the 2008 elections, Steele announced his bid to run the RNC on an episode of Hannity & Colmes. His pitch was entirely about keeping faith with the Republican base. ""There have been countless Republicans at the grassroots levels talking about staying true to who we are, focused on the message of this party and moving forward,"" Steele said. At the time, Republicans had Mike Duncan, an efficient and low-key chairman who had nonetheless presided over an excruciating defeat. The job had other aspirants, like South Carolina GOP Chairman Katon Dawson, who could point to victories in their home states. Their supporters pointed out that Steele, while one of the most talented speakers in the party, had not revealed a talent for organization in his political days in Maryland, or in his stewardship of GOPAC, or ever. Steele got past this and won. Republicans have spent the last two years regretting it, even as the party has been successful. If Steele's value was as a fresh face for the party whom the base could trust, the base found another solution to that problem one month after Steele got his job. The solution was the Tea Party. At the FreedomWorks forum, the heads of the group's PAC, Russ Walker and Max Pappas, brought four RNC chair candidates and plenty of key members to a ballroom of the Washington Hilton to pay their respects to the movement. Respects were paid. West Virginia Tea Partier Dee Armstrong rose to inform the would-be chairmen that the RNC, if it did its work, was an auxiliary of the movement. ""They didn't do Nov. 2,"" she said. ""The Tea Party made that happen."" She got no disagreement. ""I think we, as a group, did this together,"" said Saul Anuzis, the former GOP chairman from Michigan. ""I would never claim that the Republican Party did it. I would also, with all due respect, not claim the Tea Party did it. I would claim it was regular Americans who were members of the Tea Party--good, old, mad-as-hell Americans."" ""We have to reflect the true, independent nature of these Tea Parties that are out there,"" said Ann Wagner, who chaired senator-elect Roy Blunt's campaign in Missouri this year. ""The Tea Party was the catalyst of victories this fall,"" said Mike Duncan, who showed up because he's considering another run at the job. And Duncan proved his Tea Party bona fides to the crowd by reminding them of the work he'd done for Rand Paul, Kentucky's new senator. Two years into the Tea Party movement, getting even the most establishment of Republicans to agree on their goals is not a problem. The candidates were left to distinguish themselves by explaining just how fervently they believed in the Gospel of Rick Santelli. Wagner, who spent four years as the U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg, informed the crowd that she had worked in the ""heart of Europe."" ""I left after four years of living in and around socialism,"" said Wagner. ""What it really did on a daily basis for me and my children, and my husband, who came back and forth--it deepened our love, our appreciation, and our respect for America. I believe in American exceptionalism. I believe in the soul of America and the things that make us, not better, but unique."" The keep-the-faith speechifying freed up the candidates to talk about the reason they're actually running: money. And they were blunt on this point. Before running, said Anuzis, he made calls to the biggest donors he could contact to sound them out; he was horrified that they hadn't been contacted by Steele. Collins had the same experience. Duncan boasted that his post-RNC gig running the third-party group American Crossroads had kept him plugged in to the biggest donors in the country. Afterward, I asked Duncan what role he thought the two big players of 2010 had in the GOP's win--the Tea Party, and the big donors he was channeling through American Crossroads. ""We worked very well together,"" he said. ""We tried not to go at cross purposes with the Tea Party. We did not enter a single primary. Our cost of fundraising was 5 percent, by the way, which was just a phenomenal thing. We lived the life the Tea Party talks about--we were fiscally responsible!"" I had a different question for Wagner. The Tea Party was, obviously, obsessed with the ideological purity of the candidates it backed. And yet she'd helped Roy Blunt in his easy Senate campaign in Missouri, even though as the GOP minority whip in 2008 he'd done the unforgiveable and voted for TARP. How did Blunt bring the Tea Party in line with the GOP? It was deceptively easy. ""He sat down with activists,"" she said. ""He explained where he stood. And, of course, often you'll find that people may not agree on their candidate, but they'll agree on the need to oppose the other party's candidate. We can integrate these new groups out there with some of the existing coalitions and groups that they have."" Collins' idea for making this happen is for states to bolster conservative turnout in 2012 by making sure anti-""ObamaCare"" initiatives were on the ballot. It was a successful strategy for Republicans in 2004, when conservatives turned out for anti-gay marriage initiatives. Collins was just wrapping up his conversation with Abbott when I asked him about this. ""Have a sign up that says 'Don't Feed the RINOs,' "" she suggested. ""Have that trickle down to the states. Don't feed the RINOS. Because the snow falls on us all!"" Collins went on to explain what the RNC could do to boost state initiatives. The hard work of bringing in big donors wouldn't be hampered. There would be no infighting about whether a particular candidate was too RINO-esque to deserve support or if RNC money was being spread around in a state party that was helping RINOs. It isn't unheard of for a party committee to do this. But isn't it what groups like FreedomWorks, smaller Tea Party groups, and a constellation of conservative organizations already do? ""Yes,"" he said, as the Gadsden flag was packed up. ""But we can make them work together."" Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/meeting_expectations.html	"The president and Republican congressional leaders finally came together at the White House for their first meeting after the election. Afterwards, it was clear there was no thaw on the substantive disputes--they disagree even on what issues to discuss--but both sides tried to stay positive. ""We had a very nice meeting today,"" said incoming House Speaker John Boehner. President Obama heralded ""a new dialogue."" It was dubbed the Slurpee Summit, and so it was: frozen and full of artificial coloring. No one expected much from this meeting, but it did offer another opportunity to see how both the president and Republicans in Congress view the post-election landscape. GOP leaders think they have the upper hand and acted that way. Obama sees things differently. He either recognizes he's in a weaker position or he's playing for time. He either thinks he has to accommodate the other side through bipartisan gestures to get a deal or he is giving voters what he thinks they want: another show of public attempts at bipartisanship. In the dull who-shot-John debate over whether it was the president or Republicans who killed any chance at bipartisanship in 2009, Republicans point to a single anecdote. The president, during a discussion about the stimulus bill with House Republican Whip Eric Cantor, said ""I won."" GOP leaders repeat this anecdote as proof that Obama never really had an honest interest in working with the other side. He just wanted Cantor to agree with his position. Now that Republicans have won back a share of power, it's not clear what their complaint was about that meeting. Was it that Obama was being too political--that he never really wanted to cooperate at all? Or that he was being dishonest--that he said he would cooperate in public but then never did in private? The lesson they seem to have taken is the latter. Before GOP leaders met with the president, they sent a message: ""We won,"" though they said it in a few more words. Writing in the Washington Post, Boehner and Senate Minority Leader McConnell said that Republicans were coming to the meeting as representatives of the ""message voters have been delivering for more than a year,"" and that was delivered in the election. As for Democrats, they wrote: ""The November elections represented a wholesale rejection of [their] policies."" GOP leaders matched this posture after the meeting. When they recounted their discussion, they repeatedly mentioned that Obama had conceded to them that he had not tried hard enough to work with GOP leaders during his first term. ""The president did make an important point,"" said Boehner, ""that he hadn't spent much time with us, reaching out and talking to us, and [he] committed to do so."" Given that the GOP leaders have been talking about how they hope to work with the president, you might have expected them to mention how they responded to Obama's concession. In negotiations (and marriage counseling), when one side makes a low-level admission, the other side often matches it with their own little admission. I'm sorry I never listen. I didn't really mean my first priority is to limit you to one term. Such admissions keep the tiny bubbles of goodwill afloat. The president said he had fallen short. At their press conference, GOP leaders matched him by saying ""[crickets]."" In his remarks after the meeting, the president argued that the coming tax debate is a referendum on the GOP's willingness to act in good faith. He said he thinks Republican Congressional leaders recognize the country is tired of partisan bickering and he was encouraged that they wanted to make a ""sincere effort"" to get something done. If they do, then there will be a deal. If not, then Obama hopes the GOP will look like it's playing the ""old Washington game,"" as he put it. The arc of Obama's position on extending the Bush tax cuts seems to bend toward bending. If nothing is done and the tax cuts expire, as they were designed to, everyone's taxes will go up. The president will get a larger share of the blame than the Republicans. He can't have that. He's got to have a deal. This is why the GOP isn't breaking from its view that they will only accept an extension of all rates, or they'll accept nothing at all. They're confident they can do this because, as Mitch McConnell pointed out, the president doesn't have the votes for his position on tax cuts in his own party. Obama thinks they should be extended only for the middle class. A few Democratic senators want to extend them to all income brackets. The substantive news to come out of the meeting was that the White House and congressional leaders will name a negotiating team to hash out the details of a tax-cut deal.  The White House has sent the Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and OMB Director Jack Lew. House Democrats picked Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the incoming ranking member of the House Budget Committee. Senate Democrats picked Max Baucus, chairman of the Finance Committee. This should irritate liberals. They think Baucus ruined health care reform by working for months on a bipartisan deal on health care. He never got one, and during the negotiations, the forces of opposition battered the effort nearly beyond recognition. Republicans chose a slightly tougher set of characters. Jon Kyl will represent the Republicans in the Senate. You may know him as the key Republican blocking movement on the president's START treaty. In the House, Republicans named Dave Camp, the incoming chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. He has said Republicans are likely to go home for the year with everyone getting a tax increase than treat the extension of the tax rates differently. Since the election, the script of the interaction between both sides has been so predictable it makes your teeth hurt. Whose fault is this? Both sides are showing a failure of imagination. Obama offered an exciting, challenging vision of post-partisanship as a presidential candidate, but has never quite matched those expectations. Now it's the Republicans' turn to do something mildly close to changing the way things are done in Washington. But they don't seem interested in doing anything risky. Perhaps their next set of press releases issued before a meeting in which both sides claim to be listening to the other should simply proclaim, ""We look forward to accepting the president's agreement with our position.""

18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/attention_deficit.html	"In 1990, before the age of e-mail, William Schneider called George H.W. Bush ""the in-box president."" He was a caretaker rather than an ideologue, ready to handle whatever crisis hit his desk. This was seen as a limitation. Voters, the theory went, didn't just want a good steward. They wanted a president with a vision. Twenty years later, the inbox has changed, and so has the presidency. The presidential inbox is overcrowded, misleading, and full of unwelcome surprises. In the last week alone, the president has faced three unexpected emergencies: The latest round of disclosures by WikiLeaks, a North Korean attack, and an outcry over TSA screening procedures. How should a president respond to a job that is increasingly an endless series of emergencies? He has to decide what can benefit from his attention and what's a media creation or a trick of the opposition that will waste his time. On the other hand, too much restraint is a risk: A president--and this president, in particular--must quickly reflect and answer the public mood or else face the political charge that he doesn't ""get it."" Life-hacking experts counsel us not to look at e-mail first thing in the morning. That way we can focus on what's important. A president doesn't have that luxury. He may start the day with a fixed agenda, but what he finds in the inbox almost always blows him off course. (The spam in the presidential inbox is more serious, too. Requests for money from failing countries don't just come from Nigeria, but also Greece, and Ireland, and ...) So, today, for example, President Obama delivered a planned announcement about a freeze in federal pay. But the real business of the day for him and his White House aides was emergency meetings and phone calls related to the WikiLeaks disclosures and North Korean belligerence. This never stops. The president's time is like your family budget. You can look at the last few months and say: We would have been on budget if it hadn't been for October's leaky roof and September's broken dishwasher. Both were unexpected, and because they were, you think you can continue spending according to your plan. Then you realize that there will always be something--if not a broken dishwasher, then a broken arm, or a WikiLeaks disclosure, or a North Korean artillery bombardment. You've got to sock away money every month for the unexpected development. They're always going to happen, so don't pretend you're going to have that money to spend on a flat-screen television. So a great deal of the president's time is inevitably taken up by emergencies about to happen or emergencies thwarted. What we are reminded of from the WikiLeaks disclosures is how much goes on behind the scenes that we never see--secret news that North Korea is shipping missiles to Iran, hints from the Saudis that they will help us stop Iran from building a nuclear bomb, or more proof that Pakistan's uranium is barely under lock and key. Diplomacy is complicated, requiring Obama to play a direct role in persuading foreign countries to align themselves with our interest and, now, a direct role in limiting the collateral damage from the leaks. At the same time, the public wants the president to be immediately and deeply engaged in everything from ongoing disasters to the latest flash controversy. He must show quick outrage about AIG bonuses. He's got to get down to the Gulf to watch over the BP oil spill. He must show voters that he cares about their economic pain and frustration. We see the presidency as a universal gripper, able to pick up any issue and handle it--Obama must speak to the TSA pat-downs, pardon the Thanksgiving turkey, give direction and guidance to the tax debate. But he can't do all of that effectively. In some cases he has no expertise (as in the BP oil spill). Sometimes, as in the fight over tax cuts, even those things that could benefit from his sustained help can't get it because he simply doesn't have the time. The recent TSA scanning flap is a perfect demonstration of how when the president makes the right call, he increases his political exposure. Though the scanner controversy was a media sensation, it wasn't an issue worthy of a lot of a busy president's time. The Obama White House mostly treated it that way. Aides worked behind the scenes to justify the measures, but there was not a big presidential intervention. It turned out to be a Y2K-style nonevent. But discernment can quickly turn into aloofness. If the Thanksgiving weekend had gone caddywompusbecause of a snarled transportation system, the president would have been blamed. He would have been on the hook not just for the misery, but the whole thing would have been a ready-made symbol for a larger critique about incompetent government overreach. The president should have seen this coming. That he didn't is a sign, once again, that he's just too out of touch. It is surprising that the president didn't rush into the TSA situation if only because in the wake of the 2010 election, the demands that the president pay more attention have increased. The conventional wisdom has emerged that the president has not sufficiently connected with voters in his first term. That process (if it is even possible) takes a lot of time, and yet Obama is raising expectations that despite all obligations he can add more. In his post-election self-diagnosis, he has embraced the conventional wisdom and promised to get out into the country more in order to speak to voters. When is he going to find the time? There is always going to be another WikiLeaks emergency. There is always going to be a misbehaving North Korea or a bomb plot that we never hear about but that occupies the president's time. The expectations for presidential action must be reconfigured. The president may still have to pretend that he can do everything, but in truth he has to make wise choices in a frantic world, because the president never gets to Inbox Zero."	The presidency has become one emergency after another. How should Obama handle it?
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/civil_war_what_civil_war.html	"The first day of the Foreign Policy Initiative's postelection conference had wrapped. Its attendees zoomed up the semi-private elevator to the W Hotel's deck, greeted by two open bars and cocktail-snack tables that included pita bread, sushi, and structurally innovative marshmallows that looked, from a short distance, like tofu. The crowd was fairly thin--some of the foreign-policy hawks who typically come to the event had been tied up by the ground-breaking of the George W. Bush library--which made it easy to spot FreedomWorks director of state campaigns Brendan Steinhauser. Steinhauser worked harder than almost anyone in America to power the Tea Party's takeover of the GOP. If a story was coming out of the conference that day, it was that the Tea Party was threatening the interest of the GOP's conservative wing, represented by groups like FPI. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., told his audience that he worried about Kentucky Republican Senator-elect Rand Paul's agenda, and about isolationism in the GOP. Of course, some of the people responsible for electing those ""isolationists"" were right there at FPI's event, wondering what the fuss was about. Former McCain adviser and current Sarah Palin adviser Randy Scheunemann took the stage later to dismiss ""lazy reporting"" about new Republican isolationists, with ""virtually no evidence supporting this thesis."" Steinhauser agreed with him. ""You don't see isolationism from these new members,"" he said. ""Jacksonian is the word I've been using."" The new GOP class included two dozen military veterans. Perusing their campaign speeches and Web sites, there was no evidence of any disagreements with hawks like, say, John McCain, other than disagreement over what could be cut in the defense budget. The incoming Republican majority in the House and the Tea-stained Republican caucus in the Senate are being portrayed as large and unwieldy, ready to be split by debates over foreign policy and social issues. It's an irresistible story. It's just not true yet. Not even the people who spark the debates think they're setting off a massive intraconservative battle. ""There is no real civil war,"" says Chris Barron, the chairman of the board of the publicity-savvy gay Republican group GOProud. ""The new Congress won't be focusing on social issues."" Barron can talk. After the election, Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., said ""[Y]ou can't be a fiscal conservative and not a social conservative,"" a line he'd used at gatherings of religious activists. GOProud responded with an open letter co-signed by 14 Tea Party activists asking Republicans to ""resist the urge to run down any social issue rabbit holes."" It was a shot across the bow--sort of. Today, Barron frets a little about the bad old GOP that ""wasted time on Janet Jackson's nipple and Terri Schiavo."" But neither he nor any other Tea Party activist is sounding the alarm about social conservative legislation that could split the re-fused conservative movement. ""I don't see the Republicans being dumb enough to chase social issues,"" says Andrew Ian Dodge, a Maine Tea Party leader who signed the GOProud letter. ""All we were trying to do was stiffen their backbones."" That's really all conservatives with liberal social views can do. It's true that the new GOP coalition is far more economics-focused than the last few GOP majorities. That's what a crippling recession will do to a political movement. Beyond that, the GOP coalition is as socially conservative and as hawkish on foreign policy as it ever was. The indispensable religion and politics reporter Sarah Posner has been fairly lonely in pointing out that survey data show more than half of Tea Partiers--those new Republican recruits who supposedly don't care about social issues--identifying with the religious right.  For example, at least two-thirds of Tea Partiers oppose abortion; the new, Mike Castle-less Republican majority in the House is, with a handful of exceptions, pro-life. * ""In the current reporting environment,"" wrote Posner, ""figures like [Michele] Bachmann are portrayed as tea partiers first, and then the reporter looks beneath for the religion."" In order for there to be a real split in the new GOP, something bigger than a fight for attention or some backbone-stiffening, there needs to be a disagreement on some issue big enough to distract the party from its mission. It needs to be a big enough distraction to make Republicans, Tea Partiers, libertarians, evangelicals, Bo Derek, and everyone else temporarily pause the war on Barack Obama's policies. So far, nothing is playing that role. GOProud's nagging approach to the what-should-Republicans-do debate doesn't actually demand that the party change its position on any policies. (GOProud supports ""don't ask, don't tell"" reform, for example, but that's not on the Republican agenda if it isn't passed in the lame-duck session.) Instead, it's gone after the groups that are protesting a GOProud presence at CPAC 2011, the annual conservative conference, by accusing them of being insufficiently conservative on immigration, Trojan Horsers who want amnesty. Of course, all of these debates are happening in what's supposed to be the GOP's honeymoon period. Is it possible that, in 2011, some social issue bubbles up out of nowhere, or some Republican introduces social legislation that offends those noble swing voters who gave the GOP a chance this time? Sure, that's sort of what happened with the Terri Schiavo mess. And that's mostly what the economic conservatives are worried about. But a real fight between the GOP and its new members? A split on foreign policy? A split on social issues? That's not going to happen as long as Barack Obama is president. The Tea Party isn't presenting some infinite challenge that threatens what the GOP establishment does. The Tea Party won its battles with Republicans because its beliefs and priorities were the ones most Republicans had in the first place. For example. Andrew Ian Dodge remembers a pair of meetings he came to D.C. for, to meet Tea Party activists. The first, early in the movement, was partly about social issues. ""About 10 of the questions that day were about social issues,"" he remembers. After the midterms, though, Dodge returned to D.C. for a Tea Party Patriots meeting/orientation for new members. There was only one question about social issues that time, even though there were more people in the room. When most conservatives say that they need a ""three-legged stool"" of social, foreign-policy, and economic issues, they mean it deeply enough that--once they win--they don't even need to discuss it. Correction,  Dec. 1, 2010: This article originally stated that without Rep. Mike Castle, the new House majority would be ""entirely pro-life."" A handful of representatives serving in the next Congress are pro-choice. (Return to the corrected sentence.) Like  Slate on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/turkey_tussle.html	"First a prayer: May your Thanksgiving be peaceful and loving--free of pat-downs, fowl-ups, and political debate. Seriously, you don't really want to sour another Thanksgiving with a political spat, do you? Let the only use of the phrase ""quantitative easing"" be related to a third helping, because if you bring it up with Aunt Sue, the tryptophan and the topic will put the table to sleep. Plus, simply being thankful is healthy for you. Nevertheless, I recognize that some families can't resist an argument. So at least you can plan for it. The enterprising uncle of a friend of mine distributed red-and-blue plastic cups at the start of the meal so everyone could identify each family member's party affiliation before the shouting started. If this sounds familiar, the better prayer for you may be Loudon Wainwright's Thanksgiving one: ""If I argue with a loved one, Lord, please make me the winner."" In that spirit, here's Slate's guide to this year's political arguments. TSA pat-downs. Against them: This is a perfect example of government overreach. I have two terrible options: Submit to a nude picture of myself or get a hand up the fundament. TSA is run by the government, so it's neither safe or effective. And it's never actually caught anyone. The body scanners based on millimeter wave and backscatter X-ray technology find lots of false positives and can see beneath the clothing but they can't see anything in a body cavity--please pass the drumstick?--so they're useless. ""Security theater"" may make people feel better, but it's moronic to think that searching everyone--kids, pilots, cancer patients with prosthetic breasts--is going to catch terrorists. Plus, I don't need a date. For them: It's a shame vaudeville isn't still around. I'm tempted to just send you to read this great Michael Kinsley essay and go watch the game. This is public policy by Drudge Report, where the government must respond to any manufactured outcry. First, the ""outcry"" is hardly that. Fewer than one-half of 1 percent of the 34 million passengers who traveled on airplanes in or to the United States last week were subjected to crotch-area pat-downs. Catching people at the airport is the wrong way to think about the TSA. TSA screenings have made it ever harder to sneak things onto planes. That has increased the time and expertise it requires to build bombs. That gives intelligence and law enforcement officers more time to catch the would-be bombers before they catch the Supershuttle for the airport. Unlike the stereotype of the government agency, the TSA has actually been rather receptive to suggestions from outside. Remember when they used to ask you if you packed your own bags? They've backed off the no-liquids-except-in-tiny-containers rule, too. Surely it will tweak things in this case, as it already has by exempting pilots from the screening. Extending the Bush tax cutsExtend all of them forever: If Democrats allow taxes to increase, we're going to have our next Thanksgiving at Burger King. The fluttering recovery would plummet into a freefall. You can't just extend the tax rates for ""middle income"" families as President Obama would like, because that's unfair. Plus, raising the upper rate would unfairly hit small-business owners, and small business accounts for 70 percent of the net new jobs in an economy. Having lower marginal rates means people have more money they can invest, which boosts growth, which shrinks deficits. It's win-win-win! Don't extend any of them at all: Let's remember why we are in this fix: Republicans couldn't win the tax-cut debate on the merits of the magical no-deficits argument 10 years ago, so they had to use a gimmick to pass the cuts temporarily, assuming that no one would have the guts to let them expire. Let's have the guts and stop these kinds of gimmicks. A balanced budget is important, because deficits lead to higher interest rates, which will kill growth as borrowing becomes more expensive. Ending the Bush tax cuts would bring in $ 3.3 trillion.  As for job creation and economic stimulus, CBO says extending the tax cuts would not give you much bang for the buck. We could spend some of the money saved from letting the tax cuts expire on true job-creating stimulus (which voters say they want more than tax cuts, anyway). Money could better be used on aid for the states, extending unemployment insurance benefits, or creating tax credits that favor job creation. Meanwhile, I wish that we could stop having this debate and start a real one over tax simplification, with lower rates and fewer loopholes. Extend them temporarily: Higher taxes would kill consumer spending and probably the recovery. Raising the top rates might not kill the recovery, but that's not a certainty--and it certainly wouldn't help improve things. Plus, it is politically impossible with moderate Democrats voting against only a partial extension. So, let the tax cuts stay, permanently, for everyone making under $250,000 and extend them temporarily for those in the highest bracket. Let's remember that lowering the rates for those making less than $250,000 benefits everyone, including the wealthy. And let's not buy into the small-business myth: Fewer than 2 percent of small businesses pay the higher rate for those making more than $250,000 (or $170,000 for individuals). Meanwhile, I wish that we could stop having this debate and start a real one over tax simplification, with lower rates and fewer loopholes. To make this happen we should follow Kent Conrad's proposal for tying any extension of the tax cuts to fundamental reform. If reform isn't passed in 18 months, rates start to inch up or revert to the Clinton-era levels. When politicians can't find courage to act, they should write it into law. Ratifying the START treatySenate should ratify: This treaty is not a security risk and would improve relations with Russia which is crucial. Russia is helping us in Afghanistan, and it is helping put pressure on the Iranians to slow their nuclear program. If the treaty breaks down, it weakens Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who has shown that he can work with President Obama, and it strengthens Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who hasn't. (Though it appears he can work with animals). The weapons reductions only ask each side to reduce their stockpiles by a third.The U.S. arsenal will have enough missiles to maintain the deterrent. To ensure they're working, Obama has promised $85 billion to update existing systems. Why would Henry Kissinger, James Baker, and Brent Scowcroft--Republicans all--support this if it were a bad deal? Politics is supposed to stop at the water's edge. Yet Republican Sen. Jon Kyl, the primary person blocking this deal, wants to delay the vote until the next session of Congress, when Republicans will have more votes and thus more leverage over the president. Senate should not ratify: Why rush into this? Voters spoke in the election. They want Republicans to put a brake on this president. That's what Kyl is doing by calling for more time. You'd think a president who prizes thoughtful consideration would appreciate this sentiment. (And tell both Bush presidents that politics stops at the water's edge). The Russians want this deal because they think it limits our ability to deploy missile defenses. The moment Republicans tried to ensure that it wouldn't and tried to change the language of the treaty, the Russians backed off. Just this week, North Korea shot missiles at South Korea. How are we going to defend against this kind of belligerence without a strong missile defense? As far as relations with Russia go,  Russians operate in their national interest. They're not going to suddenly decide to work--or not work--with us depending on whether we ratify this treaty. And regardless of whether $85 billion is enough money to modernize our arsenal, we learned that we need to do more to keep it ready when missiles recently went offline in Wyoming. Cutting the deficit.The liberal approach: I support Rep. Jan Schakowsky's plan. It protects the middle and lower class and realigns rates for business and the wealthy. The richest 1 percent possess more net worth than the bottom 90 percent in part because tax rates for the wealthy have  fallen steeply   over the last few decades while pretax income has increased. Tax revenue should be increased by taxing dividends and capital gains like regular income and instituting a progressive estate tax. Plus, we should eliminate tax breaks for corporations that ship jobs overseas. Cuts in discretionary spending should be smart--removing outdated defense programs and farm-subsidy programs. Health care cost increases would be contained by offering a true public option. Finally, there must be some increase in stimulative spending to produce growth, which will bring in revenue to shrink the deficit faster than tax increases or spending cuts. The conservative approach: I like Rep. Paul Ryan's plan. To reduce the rising cost of health care, a major driver of the deficit, it shifts ownership of health coverage from government and employers to individuals. Individuals buying coverage for themselves--across state lines if they want to--would seek the best bargain, and force prices down as providers compete for their dollars. Medicaid payments are made to states in block grants, which makes the spending more efficient. Social Security solvency is achieved by allowing younger workers to invest in personal accounts, which will grow faster than the current system, and there is a minimum guarantee that the return will at least match what a person would have gotten under the current system. Tax simplification would reduce the system to just two rates. Business would pay a consumption tax, which is also simpler, causes less inefficient business activity for the purposes of simply avoiding taxes, and allows expenses to be deucted immediately which encourages investment. The centrist approach: Ryan's plan is too radical even for his own caucus, which barely supports it (and I'm not even going t get into the objections of liberals like Paul Krugman, who says it ignores revenues lost from tax cuts). Schakowsky's plan, on the other hand, relies too heavily on tax increases and offers no political compromises, and as a result couldn't pass even in a Congress controlled by Democrats. A more realistic approach would be a mix of the ones offered in the Simpson-Bowles or Rivlin-Domenici plans. The key is a plan that spreads the pain around so that as a political matter no one group appears to have benefitted unfairly. On the tax side it would trade lower marginal rates for removal of tax breaks for the home mortgage interest deduction and the deduction for state and local taxes which would raise revenue but also make the system more efficient. On the spending side everything gets cut--from defense spending to NPR. But there also needs to be a focus on growth, because deficit reduction cannot be achieved by tax increases and spending cuts alone. As the CBO has said, 1 percent increase in economic growth would increase tax revenues by $2.5 trillion over 10 years. Will Palin run for president? Yes: She's said she'll run if no one else picks up the mantle. She has pledged that she can beat Obama. She has said her husband is leaning toward supporting a run. She's done everything but scream it. In the recent election, she endorsed the governors of Iowa and South Carolina, key early GOP primary states. She backed the Senate candidate in New Hampshire, another one. She's also used her Facebook page to talk about her record as governor, something you wouldn't do if you just wanted to sweeten your Fox News contract. Have you seen the gauzy Everywoman ads? Plus, no politician who bathes in the constant hymns from supporters calling on her to run can reject the call. The genes will take over control of the host. Can she win? That's a separate question. No: This flirtation with running is all about selling her new book. Palin likes the limelight but doesn't like the grind. She boasts about how being outdoors in Alaska is better than a stuffy political office. Running for president would be a mostly unpleasant experience that takes her away from home and family. She is enjoying being who she is. A presidential campaign would require compromises she doesn't want to make. Trying terrorists in federal court Bad idea: Ahmed Ghailani was responsible for the embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya, and yet he almost went free. The jury acquitted him of 284 charges, including every charge of murder (there were 224!), even though there was evidence linking him to the purchase of TNT used in the Tanzania bombing. The judge did not even allow the prosecutors to call the witness who could prove that claim. In civilian court, jurors can be forced to make a deal with a holdout in order to avoid a retrial, which appears to be what happened in this case. Al-Qaida terrorists abuse the protections they are afforded in civilian courts. A military commission would have been better. Congress and the Obama administration have approved of such commissions, which allow prosecutors greater leeway in submitting evidence and which feature juries made up of military officers, who would be less unpredictable than those made up of ordinary civilians. Good idea: It's ridiculous to judge the entire American judicial system on the vagaries of a single case. Why is it so important to have civilian trials? For the same reason so much evidence was not allowed at trial: Because American principles stand for something. The judge didn't allow the key witness in this trial because the government found out about that witness only by torturing Ghailani. This trial was a triumph considering how many principles our military is supposedly fighting for were thrown out in treatment of the defendant. As Judge Lewis Kaplan told the jury, the trial showed that ""American justice can be rendered calmly, deliberately, and fairly by ordinary people, people who are not beholden to any government, not even ours."" And let's not mischaracterize military trials. They don't allow evidence obtained by torture, either. Can Obama win in 2012? No: By his own admission, the president has had a hard time communicating what he thinks and how he feels. He's been trying for almost two years and hasn't succeeded. Bill Clinton was able to come back in 1994 because he could make those connections so easily. (I'll wait while you make your joke about how easily; meanwhile, pass the yams.) Obama can't fake that connection. Also, Clinton had a far better economy to work with. In the 2010 election, Obama couldn't turn out young voters or minorities despite an exhaustive effort. In some cases, performance among those groups was lower than in 2006. He's not going to be able to count on those groups in 2012. There are also now Republican governors in the key swing states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, New Mexico, Nevada, and Wisconsin. That gives the eventual GOP candidate a leg up on organizing. Yes: The electorate that punished Democrats in 2010 will not be the same electorate in 2012. The 2012 electorate--younger, more African-Americans, more Latinos--will favor Obama. A few years of GOP control in the House will remind depressed Democratic groups why they need to turn out in elections. Political science shows that governors don't matter as much as the pundits think. Independents and moderates who soured on Democrats in this last election will judge Obama against an opponent, not against himself. And Obama will be blessed by his opponents. Even if he doesn't get Sarah Palin, his preferred candidate, the ultimate GOP opponent will get the nomination only by courting the Tea Party faction. That will produce a nominee along the lines of Sharron Angle, Christine O'Donnell, Ken Buck, or Joe Miller--Tea Party-approved but deadly in the general election. Ground Zero Mosque Let it stay: The Islamic cultural center known as Park51 is not a threat to American values, but a representation of a key American value: religious tolerance. The stated mission of the organization behind the project, the  Cordoba Initiative, is to build ""interfaith tolerance and respect."" It is promoting the exact opposite of what the 9/11 bombers believed. Its location is serendipitous, because it shows the good that Islam does just a few blocks from the horror done in Islam's name. One of the people leading the project, Abdul Rauf, is committed to reclaiming Islam from radicals like Osama Bin Laden. Bin Laden, by contrast, is committed to purifying Islam of initiatives like the one Rauf is promoting. He is as much Bin Laden's enemy as George Bush is. Move it: Why does there need to be a mosque right there? It's a matter of respecting the pain of that place for many Americans and New Yorkers and of honoring the dead. Of course Islam does not equal violence, but the 9/11 attackers made their attack in the name of Islam. Yes, everyone should be educated about the distinctions between true Islam and their distorted version, but can't we do it somewhere else? Also, the good imam who is behind this effort is not the innocent you suggest. Just days after 9/11, Abdul Rauf  suggested  ""United States' policies were an accessory to the crime that happened"" and that ""in the most direct sense, Osama bin Laden is made in the U.S.A."" When Carmelite nuns moved into an abandoned building at the edge of Auschwitz, it created a similar tension. They had the best intentions--they wanted to pray for the dead--but Pope John Paul II gave more weight to the raw feelings of Jews and asked the nuns to move. Does the GOP have a mandate? Yes: Regardless of what voters tell pollsters about Republicans, they actually voted for Republicans. They gave them control of the House to put a block on the administration. By taking immediate measures to show that Republicans are listening to voters--by enacting a ban on earmarks, targeting wasteful government spending, and other ideas--GOP leaders will only build trust. Plus, whether they actually have a mandate or not, they have to act as if they have one because Tea Party activists have made it clear that they are on ""probation."" No: Unlike after the 1994 GOP takeover of Congress, when the ruling party had public support, polls today show that Republicans are no more popular than Democrats. This was the consistent finding of pre-election polls, and it has remained true in those taken after the election. A recent CNN poll, with 48 percent seeing both the GOP and Democrats as equally unfavorable, is typical. Republicans have claimed that they are listening to the American people, but polls show people have different priorities than GOP leaders. In election exit polls, 37 percent--a near plurality--said they wanted Congress to spend more to create jobs, something Republicans say they don't want to do. Republicans also say that tax cuts are a priority. In exit polls, only 17 percent of those asked said they should be a priority. And those voters who do want cuts want them designed differently than GOP leaders do. One recent poll showed that 57 percent of the public either wants the Bush tax cuts extended for only those families making less than $250,000 or not extended at all. So did another. So did the exit polls on Election Day. Should Obama cooperate or fight with the GOP? Fight: Obama tried the cooperation route once before, and there are now 63 new House Republicans and six new Republicans in the Senate. Mitch McConnell and John Boehner show no interest in working with him. McConnell has repeatedly said his primary goal is defeating Obama in 2012. Boehner and House leaders refuse to cooperate on extending the Bush tax cuts. They'd rather taxes go up on everyone than compromise. Plus, they can't cooperate. Any Republican who works with the White House will face a Tea Party-backed primary challenge. If Obama fights for jobs, independent voters will come along. Oh, and Obama needs liberals in 2012. They don't want to see cooperation with the enemy. Don't Fight: The president shouldn't cave, exactly, but his first job should be to show voters that he hears them. So he'll heed the polling that shows the vast majority of the public wants cooperation. This is the core of why people liked him in 2008, and if he is going to recapture that constituency, the president has to remind people why they liked him in the first place. As the president has said, Obama lost independents and moderates because he took so many emergency measures, it looked like he was bent on expanding government. If he spends some time at least looking like he's willing to work with the party associated with shrinking government, then he can help correct that perception. And then if he ultimately does have to fight more overtly, he can at least say that he tried to cooperate. Catch-all If you did not find the argument your family is having in the above list, there is one failsafe measure that you can apply to engage a dearly loved rival holding forth during the meal. ""What proof do you have,"" you might ask, after they make their strongest claim. Often you will find that towering opinions are based on nothing more than a gut feeling. You can then point out that if they want to proclaim on the strong messages they're receiving from their stomach, the best way to do so is to thank the host. .

21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/three_hurdles_for_palin.html	"Sarah Palin does things her way, whether it's finding new ways to talk to her supporters or new words to use when talking to them. She has had two notable achievements recently. First, her neologism refudiate was chosen by the editors of the New Oxford American Dictionary  as Word of the Year for 2010 and added to its official lexicon. Second, she ventured from her comfortable Facebook home to cooperate with a profile in the New York Times. She comes across well--just in time for the launch of her book  America By Heart. Palin seems to recognize that if she wants to continue her rise, she is going to have to intersect with institutions like the ""traditional media"" and their ""elite opinion-makers"" on occasion. In the Times profile, Palin says she is seriously considering a run for the presidency and recognizes that this will require her to expand her tight circle. That will also mean intersecting with the ""traditional"" political and media system more often, and more regularly, no matter how much she wants to circumvent it. How closely she follows its rules is, of course, up to her. But here are three rules that she will have to contend with if she wants to become president: Voters should like you. Palin is very well-liked among conservatives, but in the broader public, she is not well-liked. This condition is not improving with familiarity. Fifty-two percent of those polled have an unfavorable opinion of her, according to a recent Gallup poll. That was her highest negative result ever in that poll. In a recent ABC/Washington Post poll, her unfavorable rating was 54 percent. She is particularly unpopular with independents and moderates, the kinds of voters in swing states who determine elections. In 2008, Karl Rove famously tried to argue that Hillary Clinton was ""fatally flawed"" when her unfavorable rating was lower than Palin's is today. Fortunately for Palin, Rove was wrong. Unfavorable numbers are certainly not good, but they do not spell certain doom. Bill Clinton's unfavorable number was 49 percent at one point in the 1992 campaign--not much lower than Palin's today. So there's hope. For Palin to succeed, she has to benefit as Clinton did. The incumbent has to be very unpopular (George H.W. Bush's unfavorable number in 1992 was 59), and the challenger has to improve her favorability rating. The first half of this equation seems at least plausible, especially if the economy continues to flag, which could further erode President Obama's popularity (his current unfavorable rating is 44). It's the second half that presents difficulties. Part of Palin's success among her core followers is that she doesn't back down. She takes on her opponents and picks fights--with old-boy Republicans like Rove; a Wall Street Journal reporter--and questions the president's manhood. But in that time period, the more people have been exposed to her, the more they dislike her. Palin's new book comes out on a dubious anniversary. A year ago, when she published her last book, was the last time a poll showed that more people viewed her favorably than unfavorably. Since then, the trend has reversed, and the gap has widened. The average of her unfavorable ratings has increased six points to 51.1 percent. Palin's unfavorable rating could be meaningless when she's put head-to-head against potential challengers. This is what made Hillary Clinton seem plausible in 2008. While Clinton's unfavorable number was high, she still outperformed potential GOP general election challengers. Palin fans cannot take the same comfort yet. In a recent Quinnipiac University poll of potential GOP candidates, Palin tied in a hypothetical primary with Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee, but in the hypothetical general-election matchups between president Obama and potential GOP candidates, Obama scores his highest against Palin with 48 percent of the vote to her 40 percent. Voters should think you're qualified. In the recent ABC/Washington Post poll, 67 percent of voters said Palin was unqualified to be president. This means that it's not just Democrats (82 percent) and independents (70 percent) who don't think she's ready for the job. Only 47 percent of Republicans think she's qualified, though more than 70 percent have a favorable view of her. This problem is harder to dismiss as a left-wing media plot, because some of her critics are conservatives. Columnist Mona Charen recently argued that Palin shouldn't run, saying she lacked the qualifications. Barbara Bush quipped that she hoped Palin would stay in Alaska. (Her son is reported to hold a similar view.) Others who have questioned Palin's competence--from Karl Rove to Sen. Lisa Murkowski--have personal spats that may color their view, but to the undecided voter, this is opposition to her core qualifications that Palin must explain. Palin no longer holds office, which is one way for candidates to show their qualifications, so she will have to make the case that proof can be found in her record. In the Times profile, she complained that the media bias made it hard for her to get across her past achievements. That's no doubt part of it, but Palin has also made the job of explaining herself harder by leaving office before her term was over. If she runs for president, she will be asking to lead the country. Quitting isn't a characteristic associated with the quality of great leaders--whether it's George Washington on Christmas Night, George Gipp of Notre Dame, or Winston Churchill during the Battle of France. The word quit isn't in leaders' vocabularies, goes the old cliche. It will be another triumph of wordsmithing if Palin can not only explain why her achievements make her qualified but also explain why quitting doesn't disqualify her. You've got to put in the time. The best way for Palin to beat the quitter rap is to show voters how hard she works. In one sense, this shouldn't be that difficult. If she is a mama grizzly, she never hibernates. She's everywhere, posting on Facebook, appearing on TLC, giving speeches and commenting on Fox News. The Times profile makes this point several times, referring to her 20-hour days, 3 a.m. e-mail messages and recounting stories of her prodigious study habits. If Palin appears this engaged as a candidate, she will be able to point to her campaign as proof of her qualifications, much as Obama did (though she'll want to deny that association, of course). But campaigns require a different kind of hard work than the stunning brand-maintenance that Palin has been engaged in since the last election. Campaigns are not fun a lot of the time. They require candidates to do lots of things they don't want to--going to small events in out-of-the-way places, coddling local politicians, sucking up to members of the local media. Campaigns also require candidates to trust people they may not know very well because they have expertise in a state. Or not trusting people who love you but who may know nothing about Iowa. Palin will have to rewire her organization--and her personal instincts--to find this balance. Can she avoid doing a lot of these dull things? Fred Thompson tried running a different kind of campaign. He failed. So did Rudy Giuliani, with the same result. Palin is more powerful and talented than Fred Thompson. But even Hillary Clinton was stung in the Iowa primaries when she didn't court voters the way they've become accustomed to being courted. Because Palin is such a superstar, and because she left office before her term was over, she's vulnerable to the rap that she's ""taking the voters for granted."" This may be an overrated vulnerability in general or a local myth pushed by local party bosses in early primary states like New Hampshire. Still, you can bet Palin's GOP opponents will be working to push this storyline regularly. Palin has told Fox News that her husband Todd is leaning toward encouraging her to make a  White House run.* This is the latest in her book tour as presidential striptease, a form which, unlike her many other innovations, she cannot claim to have invented. President Obama did the same thing. That's part of the trick: knowing which stuff to adopt and which to refudiate. *Clarification, Nov. 23, 2010: The article originally stated that Todd Palin was ""leaning toward a White House run.""

22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/give_the_people_what_we_want.html	"If either party does half of what it says it's going to do about the budget deficit, the public is going to be furious. That's the clear message, if there is one, from all the recent public-opinion polls. The public isn't that concerned about the budget deficit--it would prefer that politicians spend money on jobs first. When asked whether they support some of the ideas that might shrink the deficit, substantial majorities say no. And yet politicians keep talking about how they're going to force this bag of unpleasantness on the unwanting public. President Obama says cutting the deficit will be his main focus for the next two years. Republicans giddy from big election wins are anxious to start carving up the bloated federal government. That said, Republicans appear to be facing a larger gap between what they're planning to do and what the public actually wants. They are promising to shrink the size of government profoundly. Incoming House Speaker John Boehner has promised an ""adult conversation"" about entitlements. This all sounds very painful, and polls suggest the public doesn't like it. In a recent Quinnipiac University poll, 45 percent said they wanted more spending to create jobs. Only 32 percent said the highest priority should be reducing the deficit. In other polls, the number was lower. A recent CBS poll showed that only 4 percent cared about the deficit. People aren't desperate to go on a diet, so they're not willing to embrace any plans to shrink the buffet. According to a recent NBC poll, 70 percent of Americans say they would rather not cut programs like Medicare, Social Security, and defense. Fifty-seven percent said they were uncomfortable with increasing the Social Security retirement age to 69 over the next 60 years. A recent CNN poll showed that people are extremely reluctant to cut any big areas of the federal budget. Faced with the choice of cutting a program to reduce the deficit or protecting the program from cuts, 79 percent opposed cuts to Medicare, and 69 percent wanted to protect Medicaid. On Social Security, the equivalent figure was 78 percent. Sixty percent or more favored protecting aid to farmers, college loans, and unemployment assistance. The country is split evenly on cutting defense spending. What do people want to cut? Government salaries, ""welfare,"" and the arts, which, depending on how you figure it, represent around 10 percent of the budget. Faced with such opposition, politicians usually get cold feet about touching the portions of the budget people favor. Former President Bush describes in Decision Points what happened when he tried to do this. Democrats opposed him only, and few in his own party supported him. ""This is not a popular issue. Taking on Social Security will cost us seats,"" a House Republican leader told him. In the end, Bush says, ""I needed strong Republican backing to get a Social Security bill through Congress. I didn't have it."" There are some popular steps Congress can take, but they don't do much to solve the problem. For example: On Thursday, the GOP voted to do away with earmarks. """"This earmark ban shows the American people we are listening,"" said Boehner. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell flipped his position and supported the measure, saying that he was listening to the voters. This is worth pausing over. Once upon a time, Mitch McConnell delighted in bucking popular opinion. He was always against the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform law, for instance. Even when limits on campaign contributions received majority support in the public, he stood proudly against the tide. Yet it took him all of 14 days after the election to change his position on earmarks. While the budget choices are only getting harder, Republicans seem to be wedding themselves increasingly to the popular will. In the House, GOP leaders are turning legislation into a reality show they call ""YouCut."" Every week, they will hold an Internet contest to select an item that should be removed from the budget. Whatever people pick, House Republicans will bring up for a vote. Today the target was funding for NPR. (It failed. Democrats are still the majority for a moment.) When politicians can't be in front of a parade of public opinion, they sometimes try to convince a reluctant public that something is a good idea. Obama tried to do this with health care, and it didn't work out. When he couldn't sell it before the legislation passed, he tried to sell it after the fact. (That's what Nancy Pelosi meant when she said people would only know what was in the bill once it had passed. Republicans used that comment to kick Pelosi around for a few months.) The public didn't buy this approach, either. Republicans' most powerful political argument against the president was that he was ignoring public opinion, which, in the Republican formulation, was a reckless and arrogant thing to do. But having used this so effectively to pin down the president--and having ceded ever more of their legislating direction to the popular will--the Republican Party now finds itself caught between the conflicting demands of an ambivalent public. One way around this dilemma is to simply assert the public is behind you whether it is or isn't. It's a neat trick, ignoring public opinion while using it to sell your positions. Rep. Mike Pence is trying to pull it off when he argues for extending the Bush tax cuts for everyone permanently. ""We've got the American people on our side,"" he says. The polls don't agree. In a recent Quinnipiac poll, 57 percent of the public either wants the Bush tax cuts extended for only those families making less than $250,000 or not extended at all. A recent NBC poll found the same result. So did the exit polls on Election Day. The more common practice for a politician in Pence's position--when he has to do something more astringent than hand out lollipops--is to get out the theme music and say he's doing it on principle. (That's what Bush did with Social Security reform). Alternatively, he can pretend he alone has some special ability to divine the will of the American people. So how will Republicans get out of the box into which they've packaged themselves? They may try to do what Obama was incapable of: convince the public to do something it doesn't want to do. They could get the president's help in this; he says he shares their goal of reducing the national debt. But the question is whether either side will be willing to show its hand. The first party to announce support for an unpopular reduction may get stuck with the blame. One way around this problem is trust: If each side trusts the other, then it matters less which side goes first. But in Washington right now, the trust deficit almost matches the fiscal one.

23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/dont_tread_on_my_junk.html	"Janet Napolitano was just three months into her tenure as secretary of Homeland Security when Matt Drudge bestowed a nickname on her: ""Big Sis."" The nickname stuck, thanks to Drudge's perseverance. Since that first story in April 2009, the Big Sis brand has been trotted out for dozens of Napolitano stories, from the scary (""BIG SIS: Napolitano to Kill Spy-Satellite Program"") to the silly (""BIG SIS: Napolitano enlists Girl Scouts in effort to combat hurricanes, pandemics, terror attacks"") to--most important--the creepy sexual stuff about the Transportation Security Administration. In January 2010, Drudge linked to a story about the government acquiring body scanners by pressing the Caps-Lock key and breaking out a photo illustration of Napolitano eying a scan of a nude: ""BIG SIS WANTS TO SEE UNDER YOUR CLOTHES."" Ten months later, there is a full-blown revolt against the TSA and body scanners (which are sold by a firm with the poetically unfortunate name of Rapiscan). The revolt will crest next Wednesday, with National Opt-Out Day on the busiest travel period of the year. The accidental guerilla heroico of the revolt is John Tyner, who refused a full-body scan at San Diego International Airport then refused to let TSA agents manually search him. ""You touch my junk,"" he said, ""and I'm going to have you arrested."" What does this have to do with Matt Drudge? The Tyner Mutiny went viral because the Drudge Report gave it the blaring-siren treatment. And the site gave it the blaring-siren treatment because conservatives have been ready for a very long time to return to a familiar and comfortable opinion of Homeland Security: It must be stopped. That opinion was in hibernation, then partial hibernation, for a long time. Before 9/11, the prevailing conservative/libertarian/Republican opinion of the national-security state--of any government effort to protect Americans at the point of a gun and the touch of a rubber glove--was mistrust. The second most common opinion was fear. And the return of those emotions is a lagging reaction to the fact that Republicans no longer have to toe the party line on homeland security. They can say what they think, which is that the state can't be trusted. It's worth remembering that the idea of a cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security came from the Democratic Party just after the 9/11 attacks. (Just after 9/11, President Bush created an Office of Homeland Security within the White House.) It wasn't until 2002 that the Republican Party latched on to the concept and took ownership of it. As they pushed DHS through the House, however, Republicans made concessions that demonstrated just how ambivalent they were about the idea of a massive new national-security bureaucracy. Plans for national ID cards and a system to inform on possible terrorists were killed by Republicans like then majority leader and current Tea Party icon Dick Armey. Certain homeland security proposals, he said, were ""not consistent with a free society."" At the time, only 12 Republicans voted against the House bill creating DHS. Most Republican candidates used their support of ""a strong DHS,"" which quickly became a byword for ""being serious about terrorism,"" to clobber Democrats who wanted the new federal workers hired to staff the new department to be unionized. This was not something conservatives believed in deeply. It was a useful--and, if you ask Max Cleland, successful--campaign issue. There were always critics of the strategy. They simply didn't have much pull while Bush was president. Angry criticism of the TSA, DHS, and the surveillance state came out of a rump of congressional Republicans, from think tanks and from talk radio hosts like Alex Jones and pundits like Andrew Napolitano. But none of this challenged Republicans' strategic thinking. The first victories of the conservative civil liberties crowd came in 2007 and 2008, when they successfully beat back a plan for a national ID card--technically, nationally compatible state IDs--that had been scrapped from the first DHS bill. Tea Party activists like to date the backlash to big government to the 2008 passage of TARP. But the backlash against the TSA started a little earlier. According to Tom Blank, the deputy administrator of TSA in the post-9/11 years, the agency was always cognizant of how unpopular scanning could be. ""I used to sit around and look at these images, dial them back, and ask myself how do I take this to Capitol Hill and not be thrown out on my head?"" said Blank. ""When [Bush's second TSA administrator] Kip Hawley came in [in 2005], he changed that. He saw the politics of it and deep-sixed the program. He deep-sixed it. It got revived after the Christmas bomber."" The point about how full-body scanning got restarted is essential--it was the Obama administration picking up an idea that Republicans had cooled on. Republicans accused the administration of degrading security by dialing back war-on-terror prosecutions in the name of human rights; the response was a security measure that would affect all travelers randomly. So maybe the Drudge Report didn't really invent a backlash against Napolitano. The backlash was inevitable. Republican trust in a sprawling and invasive security apparatus was always precarious. Its collapse leaves the TSA and the Obama administration with yet another libertarian, anti-state riot on their hands. They have the media, too, for what that's worth. Alex Altman's take on the ""hysteria"" in Time dismissed the backlash as ""tailor-made for the Internet's ephemeral obsessions"" and at odds with a Pew poll showing 81 percent of people accepting full-body scans. ""Sometimes the screams of an aggrieved minority drowns out the rest of the public,"" said Altman, ""and this may be one of those cases."" Which may be true. Or not. In 2009, the smart take on the rage against health-care reform was that it was ephemeral, tailor-made for the aggrieved minority, a bunch of anti-government yokels screaming about a policy they didn't understand. Yet that rage clearly lasted long enough to hurt the Democrats at the polls this month. And health care reform at least had a cheering section in the liberal press. That press isn't cheering on the TSA. Democrats aren't particularly fond of the way the TSA operates. Pilots aren't happy. In an age of right-wing backlashes to the state, the only surprise is that this took so long. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	How Republicans learned to hate the TSA all over again.
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/ron_wyden_dutopia.html	"Ron Wyden, the Democratic senior senator from Oregon, was never good at staying on message when he talked about health care. He had his own bipartisan reform bill, with Sen. Robert Bennett of Utah, and was always full of sideways thoughts and amendments to the bill the White House wanted. So White House senior adviser David Axelrod called him to go over talking points. Wyden listened, then made a suggestion: The White House should consider ditching this whole health care issue and talking about tax reform instead. His reasoning was simple: Some people were happy with their current health care. But no one was happy with their current tax forms. Wyden had been introducing tax reforms for years, all aimed at flattening tax rates and simplifying business taxes. Then-Rep. Rahm Emanuel had sponsored one version of his tax reform in the House. Axelrod took this in. But he also pointed out to Wyden that the Obama administration had secured a massive middle class tax cut. Tax cuts made up one-third of the cost of the 2009 economic stimulus package. Wyden had an answer for that. Nobody knew that their taxes had been cut. The stimulus tax breaks were, for political purposes, invisible. ""There was a loooooong pause after I said that,"" Wyden says. Wyden is recounting all of this as part of a media blitz for, yes, his tax reform plan. He's been pitching the legislation he co-sponsored with Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire since February, when they rolled it out and explained that the White House was amenable to it. The legislation creates three marginal tax rates of 15 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent, creates a low 24 percent corporate income tax, eliminates the Alternative Minimum Tax, and simplifies the basic tax form. ""Dick Gephardt was convinced that complexity is an even bigger issue than rates,"" says Wyden. The bill was introduced when health care looked dead, and it was submerged in the ensuing frenzy over that bill's passage. But since Election Day, it's had a bit of a comeback. It was praised by Sen. Kent Conrad, chairman of the budget committee, who's been on a tear about the deficit. It was name-checked in the draft report of the Bowles-Simpson Deficit Commission, which quickly turned Wyden into one of the few Democrats willing to say kind things about what that commission could do. ""The rest of 2010,"" Wyden says, ""and the first six months of 2011--six, eight months of 2011--are really key."" Wyden's best shot is for elite opinion to circle around the findings of the deficit commission, for the president take up his cause as a political tactic, and for Republicans in the House to see benefits for themselves in a somewhat flattened tax system. These are giant-sized ""ifs."" He has become the Senate's master at proposing bipartisan bills that win encomiums from editorial boards, collect a few co-sponsors, and are politely filed away. That's what happened with his health care bill with Bennett, and that's what happened so far on his tax-reform bill. ""One day, the Wall Street Journal had a couple of op-eds, one of them I wrote,"" says Wyden. ""You say to yourself, ohhhh, everybody in America is going to be talking about it."" He rolls his eyes. ""Who talks about it? Nobody. I write op-eds, and people say, 'Ah, he's a nice guy.' "" As he talks, Wyden leans back in his office's large sofa and shifts his weight. He puts his legs up on a table, then takes them off, leans on a chair, and rocks it back and forth. There is nothing particularly original about pointing out that Wyden is awkward, wonky, and optimistic to the point of delusion about the strength of his ideas. He's well aware of the fact that if it's left up to him, tax reform won't go anywhere. The president needs to come on board, he says, because that's the only way taxes ever get reformed--sustained attention from the president. ""George Bush essentially took his presidency and early on, before 9/11, said his mandate was all about cutting taxes,"" says Wyden. ""And early on he got a group, Republicans and Democrats, to help him. Taxes really lend themselves to the presidential bully pulpit!"" By contrast, Barack Obama has ceded the tax debate to Republicans since before he was elected. ""Ever since Dukakis,"" he says, ""there was already a sense that we were on the defensive, and we had to come up with a line, and the line was: 98 percent of people won't pay anything. "" It worked in 2008, he says, but it gave Democrats no room to debate the GOP on taxes. ""We've now gone through a campaign where we used the 98 percent line, and the other side won!"" When the Democrats were riding higher, there wasn't really an incentive for them to listen to Wyden. They could push through more progressive legislation than he was proposing. That's not the case anymore. Sensing this, Wyden frames his arguments as acknowledgments of what his party did wrong, such as the selling of the stimulus as a fix-all for the economy. ""It was a mistake,"" he says. ""This [tax reform] clearly had a better link to job creation in the private sector then where we ended up, with the sense that $800 billion was a lot of government spending. We didn't get growth in the private sector. Even now, people are talking about how you're going to stimulate the economy. You do a tax reform bill now and you put a lot of money into the pockets of middle class people without increasing the deficit."" Wyden has a few other tricks meant to make the bill less pie-in-the-sky and more attractive to political hacks. When he talks about tax deductions, he calls them ""tax earmarks,"" a neologism he hopes can catch on quickly and convince resurgent conservatives that they should sign up with him. This might be his best shot at avoiding the fate of all Wyden initiatives--mild bipartisan interest followed by demagoguery. In 2008, his health care bill was a sensible solution beloved by editorial pages. In 2009, it was what Republicans suggested, too late to make a difference, as a replacement for the Affordable Care Act. In 2010, it was a bludgeon conservatives used to oust Bennett, the co-sponsor. How does a new tax reform, reviewed pretty kindly by libertarian and conservative think tanks like Cato and Heritage, avoid being branded as yet another liberal plot to redistribute wealth? Part of the strategy is convincing Republicans that this reform can improve on the bipartisan tax reform of 1986, which no one criticizes now. ""Ronald Reagan is a revered figure in the Tea Party,"" says Wyden. ""When you mention Ronald Reagan got together with people like Dick Gephardt ... Well, it's not the end of the conversation, but it starts a conversation. Remember, a lot of the new members are already out in favor of a flat tax. Dave Camp, the new chairman of the ways and means committee, who's a Republican, has already been quoted saying he liked the Reagan approach of the '80s."" The 1986 example is Wyden's answer to the people who assume he's crafted the latest of his doomed compromises. He's talked to Camp, although he won't characterize the conversation. ""By the way, guys, we've done this before!"" He waves an imaginary flag at an imaginary and very slow-moving bull. ""Yooooo-hoooo! You know? This is where it's fundamentally different than health care--first time in 100 years, huge struggle. You can say we already did it, and here were the results: 16 million jobs created after the 1986 reforms!"" Wyden has to wrap up the conversation. He has more meetings. After that, he has dinner with Erskine Bowles. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	Ron Wyden believes his perennial tax reform legislation has a chance.
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/lend_me_your_earmarks.html	"When politicians change their minds, they usually say they're acting on principle. On Monday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell did the opposite. Breaking with his longtime pro-appropriations stance, McConnell came out in favor of a moratorium on earmarks. But he hasn't changed his mind--he's merely bowing to political pressure. ""Make no mistake,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor. ""I know the good that has come from the projects I have helped support throughout my state. But there is simply no doubt that the abuse of this practice has caused Americans to view it as a symbol of the waste and out-of-control spending that every Republican in Washington is determined to fight."" Translation: Earmarks are a good idea, but most people don't get it, so I'll oppose them. Earmarks have long been a flashpoint in the debate over cutting the deficit. Now they're becoming a litmus test. Republicans are poised to take a closed-door vote on Tuesday on whether to voluntarily ban earmarks for two years. The debate has split the caucus. Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma argues that earmark money gets spent anyway and that the Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse. Sen. Tom Coburn, his fellow Oklahoman, shoots back that Congress can lower spending by reducing earmarks and that ""[n]owhere does the Constitution give Congress the authority to do earmarks."" Coburn also says that any Republican who opposes the ban can expect a primary challenge. McConnell's switch may have been politically savvy--now is no time to cross the Tea Parties--but it doesn't make much policy sense, for several reasons: Earmarks don't cost that much. Politicians talk about earmarks not because they're big, but because they're small. Voters have trouble wrapping their heads around $3 trillion in entitlement spending. But a $2 million ""pork"" project like a fruit laboratory in West Virginia is easy to understand--and to mock. The problem is, earmarks cost only about $16 billion a year, or about 1 percent of the annual federal budget. That's not nothing. But reining in a national debt that grows by $4 billion every day will take a lot more than that. Earmarks have almost nothing to do with deficit growth. Look at deficit projections, and you'll see that the primary cause of growth is health care spending. The second biggest cause is Social Security. Discretionary spending, of which earmarks are the teeniest fraction, doesn't even make the list. And even if it did: Cutting earmarks doesn't reduce spending. Most earmarks get tacked onto large spending bills with defined budgets, like the annual appropriations bill. If you take out the quarter-million dollars for turtle observation funding, you don't save that money--it just gets spent elsewhere within the bill. ""Earmarks aren't about increasing the size of the pie,"" says Ryan Alexander of Taxpayers for Common Sense. ""They're about how you divide the pie."" Coburn pushed back today, arguing that Congress could stop the White House from reappropriating money from cut stimulus projects. ""The only reason they do it now is that we allow it,"" Coburn told my Slate colleague David Weigel. But in reality, there's no way for Congress to save that money unless it explicitly reduces the size of the bill's budget--which it could do regardless of whether the bill contains earmarks or not. ""Just saying, There are no earmarks in this bill, doesn't mean the cost will be any lower as a consequence,"" says Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution. Earmarks are actually pretty transparent. Time was, congressional appropriators would simply cut checks for their favorite local programs without any accountability until the program was under way. These days, the system is a lot more transparent. In many states, would-be earmark recipients have to go through a competitive process similar to grant-writing--fill out an application, make the case to legislative aides, and undergo vetting. Their name and that of the sponsoring member of Congress is then attached to the earmark. There are still some ""undisclosed"" earmarks, but far fewer than in the past. Earmarks are responsive to local needs. There are three ways spending decisions get made. One is by formula--states and regions receive money according to, say, population. Another method is competitive grants. This money is distributed for a specific purpose, such as flood prevention in New Orleans. The last method is earmarks--giving cash to a particular individual or organization in a way that circumvents the usual merit-based process. Earmarking may be more arbitrary, but advocates say it's faster and better suited to local needs. For example, a member of Congress might have a better sense of who can best prevent flooding in New Orleans than a formula developed on the federal level. Of course, this process can be a recipe for corruption, as one person's ""understanding of local needs"" is another person's cronyism. Earmarks are tools for compromise. Anytime you need 218 people--a majority in the House--to agree on something, you need to make compromises. Sometimes you can make trades with pieces of the legislation at hand. Other times you need to promise things that fall outside its purview. That's where earmarks come in. One lawmaker might oppose the employer mandate in the health care bill, but others will support the bill only if it includes the employer mandate. Negotiators therefore have to offer unrelated perks, like money for military research or a new football stadium. It's ugly, but that's how politics works. There are plenty of downsides to earmarks. They favor politicians with clout--particularly committee members--over less powerful ones. They reward seniority. They can be arbitrary. But those drawbacks have nothing to do with deficit reduction. If Congress spent its time discussing substantial cuts instead of tiny ones, it might have balanced the budget by now.

26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/upsetting.html	"Ken Buck's campaign for U.S. Senate in Colorado is already fading into trivia, another example of how the Tea Party screwed up a Republican win. It's being forgotten too quickly. On paper, Buck's loss to Sen. Michael Bennet made no sense. Bennet, a soft-spoken bureaucrat who had never won an election before being appointed to the Senate, never cracked 50 percent in a public poll. Hours before the election, InTrade.com gave Buck a 60 percent chance of winning it. Larry Sabato, the election calculator that walks like a man, marked down Colorado as a probable Republican gain. And so on. How did Bennet do this? Well, that's easy. He had 1,900 volunteers on Election Day, he reached out to Hispanic voters, and he raised more money than his opponent, even when you added in the $5.1 million that American Crossroads spent against him. But some of this can be said about the Democrats who went down in the wave, too. I wrote about the Senate race in Colorado in mid-October, when the White House hadn't bailed on Bennet--Bill Clinton and Michelle Obama both stumped for him--but also when Buck was stubbornly ahead in polls and handicappers had moved on to discussing California and Connecticut as the Democrats' ""firewall"" to hold the upper house. I was surprised by Bennet's win. The win prompts a question: Can Democrats learn anything from the upset victory of an incumbent in a purplish state? Can they reverse-engineer this election and use the good parts to re-elect Barack Obama? ""Huh,"" says Mike Hamrick, the chairman of the Democratic Party in Arapahoe County, part of the Denver sprawl that voted for Bush in 2004, Obama in 2008, and Bennet in 2010. ""That's a tough question. I think the president and the DNC need to toot their own horns more about what they're accomplishing. We did that here. But it's easier to manage locally."" It sure is. ""Colorado was one of many states where the Republicans nominated a fresh face who wasn't ready to have everything he said on the stump be recorded,"" says Lori Weigel (no relation), a pollster for Public Opinion Strategies in the state. ""That's helpful if you're the incumbent and you need to make the alternative to you look unacceptable. Bennet did that."" He had to. According to the exit poll, there were really no reasons that voters would re-elect their Democratic senator. Sixty-two percent of voters said that Congress' next priority should be cutting taxes or reducing the deficit. Fifty-one percent of them wanted the Affordable Care Act repealed. Fifty-one percent disapproved of the job Obama was doing. Right now, that's a good snapshot of the rest of the country that Obama, presumably, wants to win over in two years. So what can Democrats learn from Bennet? Can they copy it? Mostly, no. The ""Crazy"" card can work. The number that mattered in the Colorado exit poll was this one: 54 percent of voters called Buck's views ""too extreme."" A whole lot of money and media went into making that word, and that attack, stick to him. Bennet was so shameless and assiduous about loonifying Buck that one of his ads even clipped footage of Buck, frustrated, sarcastically asking ""I'm extreme? I'm extreme?"" Quoth the narrator: ""Ken Buck asked the right question."" But the crazy card didn't work for the Democrats in dozens of House races, including two races they lost in Colorado. What was different in this race? The diversity of the ""craziness,"" for one. Bennet's rote attacks on Buck for entertaining the ideas of privatizing Social Security and implementing a national consumption tax were added to a powerful attack on his opposition to abortion in all cases and to some forms of birth control. That, according to FreedomWorks president Matt Kibbe, ""divided and distracted"" voters. Nationwide, Republicans erased the Democrats' advantage with female voters. Buck lost female voters by 17 points. Primaries can help. Andrew Romanoff, the former speaker of Colorado's House of Representatives, wanted the Senate appointment that Bennet got. He spent a year campaigning as a Washington outsider. Romanoff's campaign forced Bennet to define himself early: an affable moderate who hated Washington just as much as you did, and who seemed to go everywhere wearing microfleece. ""The primary made Bennet a better candidate,"" says Lori Weigel. But that's not something that Democrats can count on in 2012. Apart from columnists working through slow news days, no one expects a serious primary challenge to Obama; no one is talking about primaries to toughen up any of the Democrats on the ballot in two years. They're expecting to find themselves anew by contrasting themselves with the GOP. Pray for a Republican meltdown. Compared with Sharron Angle in Nevada and Christine O'Donnell in Delaware, the patron saints of Tea Party election-throwing, Buck didn't make many mistakes. He mishandled a controversy over a woman who asked him, as Weld County district attorney, to prosecute a rape case he had passed on. ""She had buyer's remorse as a result of the relationship that she had with this young man,"" he explained on Meet the Press, in words that may as well have been calculated to alienate female voters. But it was Buck's partner at the top of the ticket who messed up the battle plan. The party's nominee for governor was hobbled by a plagiarism scandal and lost to first-time candidate Dan Maes, whose own mistakes sent the party establishment running to support Constitution Party candidate Tom Tancredo. It seemed like Tancredo was preventing a disaster, but there was no way for him to really save the GOP--the party had to keep wasting time on Maes, and the Republican Governors Association bailed on the state, denying money that could have been used to help get out the whole Republican vote. It was a mess, and it helped Bennet. But it's not a mess that Democrats can expect to keep occurring when they need one. The Hispanic vote can save you. Bennet was the beneficiary of a too-clever-by-half piece of reverse psychology from a group called ""Latinos for Reform."" The startup group wanted to run a commercial in Nevada telling Hispanic voters to stay home and skip the election. It didn't run, but got tons of free media--Democrats in Colorado say that their voters heard about that and heard about campaigns in other states to go after illegal immigration. And then there was the matter of possible Gov. Tom Tancredo. ""The Republicans had the avatar of anti-immigration sentiment at the top of their ticket,"" says David Sirota, a progressive radio host and author in Denver. In 2008, the Colorado electorate was 13 percent Hispanic; in 2010, it was 12 percent. And those votes broke for Bennet. Democrats running in two years, like the Democrats this year, like Democrats two years ago, don't need immigration reform to win over Hispanics. They just need to be Democrats. So Bennet found four winning strategies in his come-from-behind win. Only one of them--the crazy card--is likely to help all Democrats in 2012. Another, the Hispanic vote, can only help in places where the Democrats have enough potential Hispanic support to make a difference. Bennet's win may have been the most impressive Democratic upset of the cycle. But good luck to the Democrats who want to clone it. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/no_comment.html	"Sarah Palin is fighting elites: the GOP establishment, know-it-alls like Karl Rove, the mainstream media, the Federal Reserve. What unites all fronts in this battle is her conviction that people who claim to know the truth, or what's best for you, do not. Palin doesn't let people tell her to be quiet, and you shouldn't, either. It is a compelling message. It also requires the very thing Palin rails against--that is, silencing even small voices of dissent. I discovered just how small when I tried to take part in the conversation among Palin's fans on her Facebook page. Palin's brand management rivals, if not surpasses, that of marketing behemoths like Apple, Nike, or Coca-Cola, all of which are known for their control over the tiniest details of their products. On Monday, Palin rebuked a reporter on her Facebook page. ""Do Wall Street Journal reporters Read the Wall Street Journal?"" she asked. The Journal reporter, Sudeep Reddy, had asserted that Palin had gotten her facts wrong in a recent speech when she said,""Everyone who ever goes out shopping for groceries knows that prices have risen significantly over the past year or so."" Grocery prices, Reddy pointed out, ""haven't risen all that significantly, in fact""--inflation is at 0.6 percent for the first nine months of 2010.  Palin responded: ""Really? That's odd, because just last Thursday, November 4, I read an article in Mr. Reddy's own Wall Street Journal titled ""Food Sellers Grit Teeth, Raise Prices: Packagers and Supermarkets Pressured to Pass Along Rising Costs, Even as Consumers Pinch Pennies."" Palin ends her post with what is sometimes known as an end zone dance. ""Now I realize I'm just a former governor and current housewife from Alaska, but even humble folks like me can read the newspaper. I'm surprised a prestigious reporter for the Wall Street Journal doesn't."" At least she called you prestigious, Mr. Reddy! Palin seemed to have his number. But then I read Reddy's critique and the story Palin says undermines it. The story Palin cites to support her claim doesn't do that. In her speech, Palin said that ""prices have risen significantly over the past year or so."" The Journal  article says prices are only ""beginning"" to rise. The time period of ""significant"" increase Palin is talking about is referred to in the first sentence of the exculpatory article as ""the tamest year of food pricing in nearly two decades."" About an hour after Palin's post, I made this point in a few sentences and posted them on Palin's Facebook page in the space allotted for readers to participate in the conversations she starts. I wanted to see if any of the other participants would respond, as they sometimes do. They didn't--because within two minutes, my post had been deleted from the steady stream of acclaim from Palin fans congratulating her for tweaking the media and urging her to run for president. It's the first time I've been kicked out of a place of worship. Whoever administers the page for Palin had deleted me so fast I didn't even have a copy of what I'd written. I posted another similar note: I think Governor Palin and the author are talking about two different time periods. Governor Palin says ""everyone who ever goes out shopping for groceries knows that prices have risen significantly over the past year or so."" The article she cites, and quotes above, says that the ""inflationary tide is //beginning.//"" Also, Governor Palin uses the word ""significantly"" which can't apply to the first nine months of the year (since grocery prices increased at a record slow pace) and if it's just the last couple of months a term like ""moderate"" might have been more precise. Recent price increases have not been like the 6 percent increase of 2008. There are a lot of interesting questions related to food prices. Do statistics really capture what people are feeling? How do price statistics take quantity changes into account? Is monetary policy really what's causing the prices to increase? What if it's foreign demand, as the article cited by Palin argues? Once again, my attempt to kick off this conversation did not happen. My second post was also deleted. I have written about how carefully Palin's staff combs her Facebook page for any offending or controversial statement. Under constant scrutiny and assault, Palin is wise to exert extra control over the communication she can control. Still, I didn't appreciate how tight the screen was or how little she trusts her readers. My experience suggests that any challenge to Palin, no matter how mild, is not allowed. These tight clubhouse rules are an echo of the ones Palin says are trying to stop the grass-roots movement she champions. There is another possible explanation for my exile: Maybe any post from me, no matter what the content, is automatically deleted. It wasn't personal, in other words, nor was it related to the content. It was just a matter of a stray Facebook setting. I tried an even more anodyne post to test this theory, writing: ""shrinking product sizes are so irritating."" That post did survive, thankfully. I'm very proud. I believe it is the basis for a platform around which the nation can rally. At least until it's deleted. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter."

28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/what_would_pelosi_do.html	"""This is going to sound wrong,"" says Ryan Hecker. ""But Obama and Pelosi--I've got to give them credit."" Hecker, a Tea Party activist based in Texas, was the main drafter of the Contract From America. It was a user-driven 10-point pledge for candidates that was signed by dozens of this week's winners in the House and Senate, and it was typical of this year's Tea Party innovations--created at the grassroots level, adopted and promoted by every conservative group that wanted to prove its bona fides. Now, all Hecker wants is for Republicans to live up to the contract. Doing so, he says, will require them to be like President Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi--and make decisions that aren't popular. ""Pelosi, especially, was very bold,"" Hecker says. ""She knew health care reform wasn't popular after a certain point, but she kept pushing it because she believed in it. That's what we need from our guys--they have to de-fund health care. They have to take it on the chin and repeal the popular parts of it, too."" Welcome to the day after the Tea Party revolution. There's been plenty of focus on the question of whether Tea Party upsets cost Republicans a few winnable seats. (Short version: They replaced a few electable candidates with losers, but made up for it with energy and surprise wins elsewhere.) For their part, however, members of the Tea Party have already moved on. They're focusing on that lengthy list of demands that Republicans signed when they were groveling for their support. These are not things that Republicans actually think they can achieve right now, but they're mistaken if they think that gets them off the hook with the Tea Party. And so far, at least, Republicans have convinced the Tea Party that they get it. They have sworn, for example, to defund the Affordable Care Act--something that, in effect, may just mean defunding the panel that implements it. But read between the lines of the interviews incoming House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell have given so far, and you can find the first notes of compromise. ""We can and should vote on straight repeal [of the Affordable Care Act], repeatedly,"" said McConnell in a speech at the Heritage Foundation on Wednesday. Moments later, he noted that conservatives would not succeed in repealing the bill, because Barack Obama was president. And in the same speech he was bearish on one of Sen. Jim DeMint's most ballyhooed priorities, a full ban on earmarks. In his Tuesday press conference, Boehner dropped only one line that could worry the Tea Party. Asked whether Republicans would support raising the debt ceiling, Boehner would only say that it was being discussed. A real Tea Partier would have said no, possibly with an expletive prefacing it. ""How can they raise it?"" asked Robin Stublen, a Tea Party leader in Florida, where the GOP did very well Tuesday. ""The debt is the first thing we talk about. Raising the debt limit is like increasing the limit on a credit card that's already been maxed out."" But it's what parties in power sometimes have to do. Obama spent some of his first State of the Union pointing out that he ""hated"" the bailout that he voted for and implemented. He, and other Democrats, spent much of 2010 apologizing or explaining why they'd failed to deliver on what the party wanted--cap-and-trade legislation, an end to the ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy, immigration reform. Some elements of their base were more forgiving (Hispanic voters, who carried Harry Reid to victory in Nevada) and some less (gay voters, who voted less Democratic than usual). So Republicans need to do a combination of education and sleight-of-hand to convince Tea Partiers that, no, seriously, they are doing everything they can to dismantle the state. ""We focus too much on the cult of the presidency in politics, in general,"" says Phil Kerpen, the vice president for public policy for the Tea Party behemoth Americans for Prosperity. ""I view some of our job as voter education about what Congress can do and can't do. The House originates appropriations, so we can start to make meaningful spending cuts, but some of that is going to die in the Senate."" So according to the strategists, walking the Tea Party through its coming disappointments will require some education through futility. ""They need to pass the best pieces of legislation they can in the House, and let them get killed in the Senate,"" says Kerpen. ""Let the Democrats be turned into party of no. Change the whole framing--inform voters that there are substantive legislative achievements being passed on the things they voted for, but the president is saying no to them."" The problem with this is that it's exactly what Democrats told their base they were doing from 2007 through the slightly brighter days of the 111th Congress. Speaker Nancy Pelosi was passing everything the base wanted--420 bills originated there, then ran up against the spinning blades and killing floor of the Senate. The Tea Party's plan for avoiding the Democrats' fate? Be the Tea Party. Americans for Prosperity and a series of smaller, newer groups spent two years building up online and phone lists of activists for rallying and getting out voters. They can be redeployed. ""We have everything that we had two years ago,"" says Colin Hanna, president of the Tea Party affiliated conservative group Let Freedom Ring, which collaborated with Tea Party Patriots on some ad hoc get-out-the-vote efforts. ""What's new is that we have 10 to 20 million activists that we can talk to."" This is what a lot of Tea Partiers are saying: Hecker, for example, is planning to tie Republican legislation to the somewhat generic principles of the Contract, to point activists toward what to support. But I pointed out to Hanna that this talk about the enduring grassroots sounds like what Democrats said their party had in the aftermath of the 2008 elections. Obama's campaign became Organizing for America; the Democrats had more volunteers, for a while, than ever before. ""Well, we have one considerable advantage,"" says Hanna. ""Our energy is rooted in principles that are over 200 years old."" All Republicans have to live up to, then, are expectations that they can restore the Constitution. This is a promise vague and lofty enough that it can be picked up easily by a Republican candidate for president. It's going to be harder for a voting member of Congress to keep it. ""If nothing else gets passed but they defund health care reform, fine,"" says Robin Stublen. ""If it's vetoed, submit it again. If it's vetoed again, submit it again. If McConnell is saying that it won't work, then they are making excuses for future failures. Don't make excuses for failing before you start your job. Anyway, when is McConnell up for re-election again? 2012?"" Actually, it's 2014, I tell him. ""Well, I guess I can wait that long."" Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."
