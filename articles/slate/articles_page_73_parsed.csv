Perhaps if he was a different sort of person, NRA Executive Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre could have fallen to his knees, cried ""Hosannah!"" and announced his conversion to the cause of gun control. But that's not who Wayne LaPierre is, and that's not why the stagey ""press conference"" became a predictable circus. The organization, based in the D.C. suburbs, rented out a location that was far more convenient for the media. Satellite trucks from all major cable networks were parked around the downtown Willard International Hotel, clustered around the main entrance with a view of the White House. If you tried to get in another way, two guards with NRA pins were ready to politely march you out. No, you had to pass a small group of pro-gun-control protesters, mostly from the groups CREDO and Avaaz.org, waving signs at anything that looked like a camera. I had the misfortune to enter the hotel along with some aimless protesters who wanted to get in the NRA's face but hadn't thought to hide their signs. ""You shouldn't be holding this!"" muttered one protester as she was turned away. ""Children are dying because of these people."" I continued to the second press checkpoint, eyed warily by yet more guards, and I picked up my hard-copy event pass: ""NRA Press Conference, Friday, Dec. 21, Washington, D.C."" The world's leading gun rights organization had booked a room fit for a second wedding--a room that filled up fast. Cameramen who showed up late, and missed out on the press risers, ambled around the print-press seats, looking for a good view of the stage. They shot over a short barricade that had been covered with a velvet curtain, keeping the ""program""--as it was called in our two-minute warning--about 15 feet from reporters. Finally, at 11 a.m., NRA President David Keene walked onto the stage and set our rules. ""And at the end of this conference we will not be taking questions,"" he said. ""Next week we will be available to any of you who are interested in talking about these or other issues of interest to you, so contact us, please, at that point."" A rare event that had attracted top anchors was transformed into a one-way conversation. The media's questions, suddenly, were subject to a three-day waiting period. We stayed quiet as LaPierre, a 64-year-old who has spent most of his life at the NRA, took to the podium. His head sunk, as if he needed to compose himself for a confession. ""While some have tried to exploit tragedy for political gain,"" he said. ""We have remained respectably silent."" This was what the NRA said in response to every mass shooting, but it hadn't been enough this week, so LaPierre promised to ""speak for the safety of our nation's children."" America's youth were being put at risk by the lack of armed guards in schools. ""How have our nation's priorities gotten so far out of order!"" said LaPierre. ""Think about it. We care about our money, so we protect our banks with armed guards. American airports, office buildings, power plants, court houses, even sports stadiums are all protected by armed security."" Unbeknownst to LaPierre, or to any of the security guards lurking around wearing NRA pins, two members of the leftist protest troupe Code Pink had gotten into the event with media credentials. Now, one of them had a cue. He walked toward the barricade and unfurled a sign, giving photographers a perfect shot--the NRA president in the background and a pink sign in the foreground. ""Stop killing our children!"" yelled the protester. ""It's the NRA and--the assault weapons that are killing our children, not armed teachers!"" LaPierre tried at first to talk over the interruption. He gave up, sinking his head again, as the security guards slowly dragged away the distraction. When the protester was out of the room, LaPierre picked up his script: ""The truth is that our society is populated by an unknown number of genuine monsters."" The protest had only delayed a weird riff on pop culture, one that could have been frozen in Lucite from 2000, the last time LaPierre was on the defensive. ""There exists in this country, sadly, a callous, corrupt, and corrupting shadow industry that sells and stows violence against its own people,"" he said. It did this through games ""with names like Bullet Storm, Grand Theft Auto, Mortal Kombat, and Splatterhouse."" The first game was from 2011, but the rest were from 1997, 1995, and 1988--and the last two didn't even give their characters any guns. LaPierre queued up a crude first-person shooter on the TV screens behind him. ""Here's one, it's called 'Kindergarten Killers.' It's been online for 10 years. How come my research staff can find it, and all of yours couldn't?"" Hadn't he just said that the NRA was holding off on comments until it knew Adam Lanza's story? Where'd this video game stuff come from? It was a swipe at the media. LaPierre, when he's more on his game, is good at that sort of thing. But as projection goes, it's awfully lazy. LaPierre insisted that media's ""corporate owners and their stockholders"" benefit from violent sleaze, then proposed a massacre-prevention plan that would ramp up sales for the industry that funds the NRA. ""Before Congress reconvenes,"" he said, ""before we engage in any lengthy debate over legislation, regulation, or anything else, as soon as our kids return to school after the holiday break, we need to have every single school in America immediately deploy a protection program proven to work and by that I mean armed security."" This security could be drawn from the ranks of ""active, retired police, active, Reserve, and retired military, security professionals, certified firefighters, security professionals, rescue personnel, an extraordinary corps of patriotic, trained, qualified citizens."" The idea was equal parts silly and brilliant. LaPierre's hardest-fought media battles came in 1999 and 2000, in the aftermath of the massacre at Columbine High School. That school was guarded by armed sheriff's deputies, who were unable to stop the massacre. But LaPierre had to have seen this week's Gallup poll, which asked Americans for their views on a few massacre-prevention ideas. Sixty-three percent of Americans were open to a new assault weapons ban. But 64 percent wanted ""at least one person"" at every school to be armed, and 87 percent were open to more ""police presence"" at schools. As buffoonish as he looked and sounded, LaPierre was getting a captive media to talk about a popular, unexplored, gun industry-friendly master plan. He'll get to say it again this Sunday on Meet the Press. LaPierre's comments were online in full before the event had ended. He introduced former DEA Director Asa Hutchison as the man who'd lead the ""National Model School Shield Program,"" with a budget provided by the NRA, before this eventual guns-in-schools plan could be paid for by the feds. Then he vanished behind a velvet curtain, acknowledging shouted questions with a wave and a ""Thank you very much!"" The NRA couldn't be silent anymore, but it could sure try to control the press. ""This is the beginning of a serious conversation,"" said Keene. ""We won't be taking questions today."""	Why the NRA's Press Conference Was Silly and Brilliant	[]	['guns']

Republicans and Democrats are, of course, struggling to reduce the budget deficit in the long run and avoid the so-called fiscal cliff in the short run. Both sides claim to represent the preferences of the American people. Beyond the election results, however, we know relatively little about the fix favored by average Americans. A couple of years ago, the New York Times gave us ""O.K., You Fix the Budget,"" which allowed readers to plug in their own tax hikes and cuts and tinker. The enterprising readers who did so were a self-selecting bunch. We wanted to know how a broad and representative sample would fix the budget. We also wanted our sample to focus on big-ticket items, like Medicare or a national sales tax, rather than small change like foreign aid. So we created a poll (sponsored by the Oscar M. Ruebhausen Fund and conducted by YouGov) that measures support for different options to reduce the deficit. We asked a representative sample of 1,000 Americans to choose the options that were the ""least painful."" The gist: We found that on average, people want higher taxes, cuts in government services, and military downsizing--but want to preserve Medicare and Social Security. Our poll differs from other recent polls about deficit reduction, because they asked questions in a vacuum.  For example, if a poll just asks whether respondents favor cuts to Medicare or Social Security benefits, the answers don't mean much, because the people being polled probably don't know how much cutting Medicare would save, what total level of cuts to aim for, or what the alternatives are. Our poll, which you can try out here, gives our sample of Americans a specific deficit reduction goal: They must cut $900 billion from the projected deficit in 2022. We chose this amount because it would bring the projected deficit down by two-thirds, to a sustainable level in the long run. The target puts the specific options in context, and removes the luxury of avoiding painful choices. We gave 10 options for raising revenue or cutting spending--enough for real choice without being overwhelming--with cumulative savings of $2.1 trillion, and corresponding to deficit reduction options from the Congressional Budget Office. So what exactly does the people's grand bargain look like?"	We Did the Best Poll of How Americans Want to Fix the Budget	[]	[]
2	2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/12/benghazi_report_not_a_cover_up.html	"During the drive to one of Barack Obama's final campaign stops, navigating the suburbs of Columbus, Ohio, I found a dozen or so protesters standing where the media might see them. They held up handmade posters, demanding more questions and answers about the Sept. 11 attack on America's consulate in Benghazi. One sign simply named the four Americans killed that day, in letters too big to miss. The others assigned blame: Obama Said ""Stand Down"" Ask About Benghazi Tell the Truth Obama Media at the time--conservative media, especially--were reporting every possible turn, twist, and revelation about the attacks. The ""stand down"" theory originated in an October 26 Fox News EXCLUSIVE (capital letters in the original), which reported that the CIA ""chain of command"" had ""told the CIA operators twice to 'stand down' rather than help"" besieged Americans. A complementary theory, advanced by the father of the murdered Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods, suggested that the White House had a ""live feed"" of the attack and sat shiva, doing nothing. Another theory, universally shared: The White House, led by people like UN Ambassador Susan Rice, was engaged in a massive cover-up. This anger and panic added impetus to a study of the Benghazi killings, conducted by the State Department's Accountability Review Board. The grimmest tales, the fodder for outrage and fulmination, were debunked. In fact, the problems at Benghazi started months before the attack, not in a fit of on-the-spot cowardice. According to the report, the incident began around 9:42 p.m., after the day's work was over. (To simplify matters, I've converted the military time in the report to standard time.) There were seven Americans at the consulate, which consisted of several buildings, and they were guarded by four members of the February 17 Martyr's Brigade. ""Guarded"" is a lose term. A regional security officer saw, via a security camera, that ""dozens of individuals"" were marching through the compound's main gate. The guards had fled; a police car, which was supposed to be outside, was gone. The official account continues: Just prior to receiving the TDY RSO's distress call shortly after [9:42] local, the head of Annex security heard multiple explosions coming from the north in the direction of the SMC. The Annex security head immediately began to organize his team's departure and notified his superiors, who began to contact local security elements to request support. The Annex response team departed its compound in two vehicles at approximately [10:05] local. The Oct. 26 Fox News report doesn't read this way. ""Former Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods was part of a small team who was at the CIA annex about a mile from the U.S. consulate where Ambassador Chris Stevens and his team came under attack,"" reported Fox's Jennifer Griffin. ""When he and others heard the shots fired, they informed their higher-ups at the annex to tell them what they were hearing and requested permission to go to the consulate and help out. They were told to 'stand down,' according to sources familiar with the exchange. Soon after, they were again told to 'stand down.' "" The ""stand down"" line resonated. On this year's presidential campaign trail, Sen. John McCain said he was hearing from ""veterans all over the world"" about how the commander-in-chief had left men behind. ""Four brave Americans lost their lives, and they didn't have to!"" said McCain at an Oct. 30 Ohio rally for Mitt Romney. ""Beginning, during, and ending that terrible period in Benghazi, the United States president was AWOL."" This made it sound like Obama, atop the chain of command, allowed yellow-bellied bureaucrats to let men die. That's not backed up by the report. At 9:50 p.m., the main American embassy in Tripoli was talking to Stevens, who said the consulate was under attack ""before the call was cut off."" The Americans scrambled to send a security team from Tripoli to Benghazi. In the intervening hours, Stevens was killed, pronounced dead at around 2 a.m. ""by apparent smoke inhalation."" Three hours later, the security team arrived, and ""less than fifteen minutes later, the Annex came under mortar and RPG attack, with five mortar rounds impacting close together in under 90 seconds. Three rounds hit the roof of an Annex building, killing security officers Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty."" They weren't denied help. The help came too late. That doesn't alter the tragedy, but it alters the context. Back to the death of Stevens--the murder committed by ""smoke inhalation."" The report describes the start of the clash as a rampaging mob of ""armed intruders"" who ""used filled fuel cans that were stored next to new, uninstalled generators at the February 17 living quarters near the C1 entrance to burn that building,"" and ""lit on fire vehicles that were parked nearby."" Stevens had been requesting more security, but on the ground, that day, things were quiet until the mob arrived. As Erik Wemple points out, this contradicts the other damaging accusation from the scandal known as ""Benghazi-gate."" The Obama administration's first fumbling attempts to explain the killings put them in the context of ""protests"" against a viral anti-Muhammad movie. On Sept. 16, UN Ambassador Susan Rice probably talked her way out of a promotion by sticking to talking points on the event and saying a ""spontaneous"" protest was hijacked by an armed ""clusters of extremists."" McCain and other critics scoffed at the gullibility on display. ""Most people don't bring rocket-propelled grenades and heavy weapons to a demonstration,"" said McCain on CBS News, speaking immediately after Rice. The truth lay in between the talking points and the snark. The mob that crashed the consulate was attacking diplomats. But they were able to kill our ambassador, and sow confusion, by setting fires. The heavy weapons came later. So far, three State Department officials have fallen on their swords in response to this report. That was what investigators asked for, basically, blaming the circumstances in Benghazi on ""senior State Department officials"" who ""demonstrated a lack of proactive leadership and management ability."" They failed to provide security before Sept. 11. On Tuesday, describing the video he'd been able to watch of the attack, Sen. Bob Corker told reporters that the compound was so wanly protected that ""you or I could have walked right in."" That doesn't suggest a real-time campaign of cowardice. It doesn't suggest a cover-up, either. It suggests that the neglected budget for embassy security needs a harder look in 2013. When that happens--or when it doesn't happen--we'll know what politicians learned from Benghazi."

3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/12/presidential_succession_order_the_president_pro_tempore_of_the_senate_shouldn.html	"Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), who passed away on Monday, was many things--a war hero, a civil rights pioneer, an old bull of the Senate, a tireless fighter for Hawaii, a committee chairman, and both last and least, he was president pro tempore of the United States Senate. It's a title that sounds impressive--it has both ""president"" and Latin in it--but in fact it's meaningless. Inouye made a run to lead the Democratic caucus way back in 1989 but lost to then Sen. George Mitchell of Maine. The pro tempore designation is just an honorific routinely bestowed on the most senior member of the majority caucus. Before Inouye, it was Robert Byrd's gig. Before him came Ted Stevens. Before that it bounced back and forth between Byrd and Strom Thurmond. Nobody really needs to care about this as anything other than a trivia question answer except that a thoughtless provision of the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 puts its holder in line for the presidency. And not just some random place in line. Close to the front. Imagine some disastrous scenario--a terrorist attack most likely--that simultaneously kills or disabled the president, vice president, and House speaker all at once while they're negotiating the latest budget crisis. Who's next in line? The president pro tempore of the United States Senate, someone nobody intended to put in any kind of position of national leadership. Indeed, it is almost invariably someone his colleagues have passed over as caucus leader in favor of a senator who is younger and more reflective of the current spirit of politics. The president pro tempore is in the order of succession thanks to the kind of logic that makes a lot of sense in the halls of Congress and no sense outside of it. The speaker of the House got on the list, so the dignity of the Senate demands that they get someone in there, too. And if not the president pro tempore, then who? In real-world terms, of course, the Senate equivalent of the House speaker is the majority leader. But in technical terms, that's not correct. Speaker of the House of Representatives is an official federal government title. Though in practice the speaker is simply the leader of the majority party in the House, in theory he or she is the speaker of the whole House. The majority leader of the Senate, by contrast, merely holds a position in his party's caucus. The senator who holds a national office is the president pro tempore of the Senate. At the same time, the Senate is by its nature a tradition-bound and seniority-driven institution, so it sticks with the convention that the office must always be given to the most senior member of the majority party rather than to someone who anyone thinks would be a good leader of the country. The problems with this setup begin with the problems it has in common with putting the speaker in the line of succession. Most problematically, an assassin could effect a change in partisan control of the executive branch--exactly what the country doesn't need in a time of crisis. There are also odd constitutional ambiguities in the event that the president is killed while the vice president is merely rendered unconscious. At that point, the speaker would be called upon to serve as acting president. But the Constitution forbids legislators from holding executive office, so he'd have to resign his seat. That might seem like an overreaction if the vice president is expected to be lucid within a few hours, and yet it would be inopportune for the country to simply be without leadership on a day of crisis simply because a legislative leader doesn't want to quit his job. The Senate version carries all these problems but compounds them with the difficulty that the most senior senator is often quite old. Inouye's death is a sad event, but hardly a shocking one. He'd been using a wheelchair all year and was dependent for months on an oxygen concentrator to maintain breathing even before his most recent turn for the worse. Inouye's predecessor, Byrd, also died in office and for the last 18 months of his life, the extent of his deteriorating health condition was a closely held secret of his inner circle. Strom Thurmond served as president pro tempore even after voluntarily relinquishing the right to chair a committee out of recognition of his advanced age and declining capacity for work. Ted Stevens left the senate in remarkably good health for a man of 86. With Inouye dead, the honor passes to Pat Leahy of Vermont, who's unusually young for the office at the age of 72 and with no known infirmities beyond longstanding blindness in one eye. His counterpart on the GOP side, Orrin Hatch, is 78 and was just elected to a fresh six-year term. With neither man currently unable to shoulder the modest workload of a committee chairman, it's perhaps easy to be complacent about government continuity in the admittedly unlikely event of a multiple-assassination scenario. That said, the whole purpose of having a Presidential Succession Act in the first place is to ensure that some sensible contingencies are put in place. And turning the White House over to an elderly senator of the majority party is not sensible. And unlike many national problems, this one could be easily fixed even during a time of ideological polarization. Having the presidency pass directly from the vice president to the secretary of state and then down through the ranks of the cabinet officers is logical, simple, and does nothing to advantage or disadvantage either party or its vision in the long term. And what better time than the current moment of legislative gridlock to work on an issue that's off the main axis of political conflict? As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Leahy himself has the relevant jurisdiction and could do the country a huge favor by stepping up and authoring a bill to selflessly remove himself from the order of succession. Ninety-nine years out of 100 it won't make any difference, but some day it just might, and we'll thank him."	Get These Old Senators Out of the Presidential Order of Succession.	['Leahy']	[]

Maybe I spend too much time listening to politicians. Maybe I can't get past seeing my children in that line of kids holding hands as they're being led through the Sandy Hook school parking lot. But I don't want to hear President Obama talk about gun control six hours after the shooting. When he spoke this afternoon, he said there will be time to take action and then he returned the focus to where it should be, on the parents grieving over the loss of those 20 children. We're all trying to come to terms with today's tragedy and for a lot of people that means talking about gun control or fighting against it. For others it's about mental health. It's probably about both. Have at it. Light up Twitter. But the president's job today is not to get into that debate. His job is to lend some comfort to those parents who thought they were going to have family movie night tonight or whose biggest worry today was supposed to be how to beat the weekend traffic on their annual holiday trip. (You can argue that a president shouldn't play this role, but this is the one we have come to cast him in.) ""We never come out here,"" a local television reporter just said of Newtown, Conn., which was always too sleepy and calm to make the Action News. It is a horrible sucking hole of woe that has been opened up in Connecticut and the president's job today is to bear witness for those stuck in that hole. Maybe the president's words never reach those families, but he can speak to the community, to the parents who are at sea, sick to their stomachs about their neighbors and who feel guilty that they're happy they have kids they can still hug. For the rest of the nation, I'm betting more people see this as a human tragedy than a moment for political debate. If that's so, I'm guessing those people could also use a little guidance, comfort, or fellow-feeling from their president. Better that a president make some stab at giving them that solace than cheapen the moment by making a political point. Politics cheapens almost everything, why should we imagine an emergency dose right now is a good idea? Even if the president fails in all this, even if those of us in the blast radius find no comfort in connecting with his tears at the podium, he at least can keep from stirring up the big public roar. The media already skips over the families of the victims to obsess over the shooter. When Obama visited the families of the victims in Aurora, Col., they asked him to do what he could to get the media to focus on the victims, not the shooter. Why should the president help kick up a gun debate today that will give the media another topic to obsess over at the expense of the families? The gun debate will go on tonight as will the madness over the shooter (perhaps by daybreak we'll stop misidentifying him), but the president doesn't have to contribute to it. Plus, words are cheap today. If you're an advocate for gun control, shouldn't the crucial moment be in four weeks or four months when nothing has happened to prevent another day like today? The president said, ""We're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics."" OK, so hold him to that. The president is the only one who can start this debate and sustain it. Because while a president's ability to shape public opinion is more limited than we think, he does have the power to put things on the agenda and keep them there. The cycle is familiar: shock and outrage followed by inaction, whether the shootings are in a movie theater or on a street corner in Chicago. That's when the president will need to hear these voices. Those voices will be proof that there is a sustaining passion for a political solution and that today's calls for action aren't just another bout of momentary outrage that has come and gone too many times before."

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/12/paul_ryan_has_been_quiet_since_barack_obama_won_re_election_but_he_will.html	"Right after the 2012 election, when Republicans trudged glumly back to Washington, Speaker of the House John Boehner found two jobs for Paul Ryan. By Ryan's request, he would stay on as chairman of the Budget Committee--he'd be the only chairman holding on after his six-year term at the top of a committee had ended. By necessity, he would also join a working group to help Boehner negotiate a way around the ""fiscal cliff."" Ryan would partner with Ways and Means Committee chairman Dave Camp and Energy and Commerce Committee chairman Fred Upton in crafting proposals, strategizing, and calculating. If the White House wanted to talk to Ryan, congressional liaison Rob Nabors knew where to find him. It's been a month. While the White House has been talking to Boehner, Ryan hasn't been so busy. The B-team of Camp, Ryan, and Upton has stayed on the bench. Ryan hasn't recently met or talked to key negotiators. Ryan's big moment in the talks, so far, came with the three-page offer that House Republicans sent the president on Dec. 3. According to National Review, Ryan ""worked with Boehner to craft"" the document. They spent two pages explaining how proud they were of Ryan's budgets and two paragraphs offering $800 billion of unspecified revenue and $1.2 trillion of unspecified cuts. And the White House rejected that at the speed of Twitter. Paul Ryan is irrelevant, but that can't last. No one in modern times has lost a national election and returned to such a powerful role in Congress. John Kerry's consolation prize was minority status in the Senate. After his loss, George McGovern was so marginalized that he considered moving to England. The chairman of the House Budget Committee can't be marginalized. For two years, Ryan was the de facto intellectual leader of the GOP, introducing and passing spending plans that nearly every Republican supported. He's got two more years of that on the calendar, and his rank-and-file members are thrilled. ""The American people are looking to him for ideas,"" Colorado Rep. Cory Gardner told me last month. Gardner and other freshman fans of Ryan believe that the vice-presidential campaign, even if a loss, still helped him; without that, Americans ""might not have known who he was."" Ryan's absence from the ""cliff"" debate has actually helped his clout--among Republicans. They resent their current position. They passed their budgets (Ryan's budgets). The media doesn't seem to take that seriously. Obama's Democrats haven't pushed a budget through since 2009; the media doesn't care. ""Our perspective is, 'Yes, we think our budget is the way forward,' "" says Rep. Sean Duffy, a freshman from northwestern Wisconsin and a Ryan stalwart. ""The president rejected it. There was an effort to be reasonable and to meet the concerns he had, so we came off the budget a little, but the president needs to lead."" That's the polite version of the sentiment. In the Senate, utterly marginalized by the Boehner-Obama talks, Republicans resent that the ""cliff"" negotiation is so secretive. In a real budget debate, says Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, ""You have hearings on it. You have witnesses. You have a debate about what you want, then you have mark-up. That's the way this should work ... as opposed to seeing on the news: Do Speaker Boehner and President Obama get along? Is it going to be $1 for $2? For $3? That's drivel. That's meaningless."" But it's happening because neither Ryan nor the White House made any steps to work out their differences. At key moments of possible compromise--on the Simpson-Bowles commission, during the debt-limit crisis--he's kicked over the table. Ryan voted against the final Simpson-Bowles recommendation because it ""didn't address health care"" and raised taxes. In the summer of 2011, when Boehner kept bringing versions of a ""grand bargain"" back to the Hill, Ryan argued against passing anything that raised taxes. He fretted that a deal would smooth Barack Obama's path to re-election. During that campaign, Obama was able to exploit Ryan's calcified positions, hitting him for the specifics of his Medicare reform and the vagueness of his cuts. Ryan's 2012 and 2013 budgets proposed $2.2 trillion in discretionary spending cuts, but only third-party think-tank researchers bothered to calculate what would get lopped off. Ryan would show audiences a series of slides about the national debt to emphasize the need for cuts. There were no slides about his actual budget. What's changed since Obama won? Nothing, really. Ryan has given a few on-the-record interviews, mostly to local media. His longest stint in front of the camera was a speech at the Jack Kemp Foundation's leadership awards, where the main attraction was Sen. Marco Rubio. ""You know any good diners in New Hampshire or Iowa?"" asked Ryan. ""I'm sure the press won't read much into that."" Ryan's speech described the 2012 election as a ""close"" and temporary loss. ""We have a compassionate vision based on ideas that work,"" he said, ""but sometimes we don't do a good job of laying out that vision."" There are two schools of Republican thought on the election: one that believes that the party needs to shift on some issues and one that believes that all that is needed is better messaging. Ryan was walking through door No. 2. He wanted Republicans to apply ""the welfare-reform mindset with equal vigor across the spectrum of anti-poverty programs."" But he said less about how than he'd offered in his campaign speeches. And that, still, was more than he needed to do. As long as Republicans are in a horrific negotiating position, Ryan's going to be less visible. He'll be out front again in four-odd months, when he proposes his next budget. There's just no real negotiation happening between the congressman who would propose massive reforms and the president who would sign them. By ignoring him now, the White House will allow him to say that the serious work of tax and entitlement reform started with House Republicans. Until then, Ryan can lend Republicans his brand. On Thursday, Boehner held a mostly useless update on fiscal-cliff talks that featured one fresh hook. He had a new chart, provided by Ryan, labeled ""Spending Is the Problem,"" with the slogan helpfully hashtagged for maximum tweetage. The chart contrasted projected revenue from higher taxes with the projected growth of the federal budget. ""It's this issue--spending!"" said Boehner, waving his arm at the chart. ""Go back to polling--most people would agree that spending is a much bigger problem than raising taxes."" The chart and its designer weren't particularly relevant to the matter at hand. They were a preview of what, and who, would matter again next year."	Where in the World Is Paul Ryan?	['McGovern', 'Upton', 'Gardner', 'Rubio', 'Paul', 'Obama']	[]

Charles Carrico, voters can be divided into two species. The first: ""people in my district,"" which covers a swath of the state's rural southwest. These voters are real people. The second species: voters in ""metropolitan districts."" In 2012 and 2008, rural voters watched Democrats turn out that metro vote, which elected Barack Obama. That experience apparently taught Carrico and the people he represents that ""their votes don't mean anything."" Carrico's solution: Make the rural vote matter more and make the metro vote count less. His bill, SB273, would assign 11 of Virginia's electoral votes to its 11 congressional districts. The state's two remaining votes would go to whoever received the ""highest number of votes in a majority of congressional districts."" Four of those 11 districts contain huge clusters of Democrats, and voted for Obama. The next seven districts, largely rural, voted for Mitt Romney. Had the Carrico proposal gone into effect this year, Romney would have lost Virginia's popular vote by 4 points and carried nine of its 13 electors. The metro denizen's vote would have still meant something, sure. It would have meant less than the vote of the angry coal miner in Appalachia. When I heard about the Carrico proposal and called around, Democrats shrugged. Virginia Republicans control both houses of the Legislature, but they control the Senate only narrowly. Virginia voted Republican for 44 years until Barack Obama came along. Why would the party confidently tear up the map, if some 2016 savior could actually carry the whole state? It's a good question, but it wasn't supposed to be asked this quickly. Republicans took control of Pennsylvania's legislature in 2010, but not until September 2011 did they propose an electoral vote split. That failed, done in by public pressure and--probably more importantly--by Republican members of Congress worrying that it would goose the turnout against them. Republicans escaped the 2012 election with continued control of most state houses and governor's mansions. But this time the electoral vote rethink is happening more quickly. In Pennsylvania , there is a proposal to split electors by popular vote. In Ohio, Secretary of State Jon Husted has mused that dividing the electoral vote by congressional district would make the election less messy. In every state, the rationale is the same--it's just not fair for urbanites to swarm the polls and outvote everybody else. One week after the loss, Rep. Paul Ryan admitted his ""surprise"" at ""some of the turnout, especially in urban areas, which gave President Obama the big margin to win this race."" This is a totally understandable reaction to electoral tragedy. After George W. Bush won the 2004 election--literally, hours after that happened--a message board commenter presented a map of Canada and the United States reimagined as two new states. The ""United States of Canada"" brought together our northern neighbor and the states that voted for John Kerry. ""Jesusland"" represented the Bush states. It was a viral hit, especially among Americans who didn't know much about Canada. (Alberta has more in common with Texas than it has with Minnesota.) A small group of self-parodying college professors wrote proposals for possible secessions. You can still find these arguments on the left. In Better Off Without 'Em, published at the end of the summer, author Chuck Thompson argues that the fundamental and fundamentalist beliefs of white Southerners make them incompatible with enlightened democracy. ""Just as the Civil War could have easily been avoided,"" he writes, ""so, too, might have the money and virtue pit of Iraq been sidestepped had not all the Armageddon bullshit and demagogic bluster about threats to 'our freedom' yet again worked their sinister magic on the hoi polloi."" But Thompson has as much legislative power as the guy who upgrades you from cable to a satellite dish. All of the active discussions of electoral vote change-ups are coming from Republicans. They're coming after a wave of redistricting which, in Republican-run states, generally packed Democrats close together and gave running room for the home team. In Ryan's Wisconsin, the big urban vote that gave the state to Obama by 7 points didn't actually affect Republicans running in congressional, House, and Senate districts. The Republican-run remapping of 2011, which will remain in effect until 2020, minimized the power of the cities by creating safe seats for Democrats. In Wisconsin, Democrats carried only three of eight House seats, 16 of 33 Senate seats, and 43 of 99 Assembly seats. This isn't just a matter of Republican survival. To some conservatives, it's a matter of economic survival. The fear of mooching urban voters and college-town liberals is as old as Barack Obama himself. According to Stanley Kurtz, the author of Radical-in-Chief and Spreading the Wealth, Obama is using the powers of the federal government to pull people and money out of the suburbs and into the cities. ""Although it remains almost totally unknown to the public,"" writes Kurtz in the second book, ""a great deal of Obama's early political career was devoted to the goal of abolishing America's suburbs, a project he undertook in close collaboration with his Alinskyite organizing mentors."" And the people who worked hard for their estates got outvoted by people who want to loot them. I don't think the overall urban vote backlash is quite so sophisticated. That hasn't stanched its success. After the election, an AFL-CIO survey asked Obama voters and Romney voters how long they had to wait to vote. Only 9 percent of Romney's people waited for 30 minutes or more. Sixteen percent of Obama's voters had to wait that long. The reason for that, in the most closely-watched states like Ohio and Florida, was that the electoral rules and standards that worked smoothly for smaller rural precincts got clogged in busy urban precincts. On Monday, as Sen. Carrico was talking up his bill, the Pew Research Center brought together a group of secretaries of state and campaign strategists. The topic: Whether the voting snafus of 2012 could be fixed. Democrats were interested. Republicans wanted to slow down and really think about this. Did urbanites have a harder time voting? Yes. Did that hurt Democrats? Well, sure. ""I don't hold out any hope that there's going to be a bipartisan agreement,"" said Scott Tranter, who'd consulted for the Romney campaign. ""At the end of the day, we're all campaign officials, and we want to do whatever we can to help our side. Sometimes that's voter ID. Sometimes that's longer lines. Whatever it may be."""

This was predictable. The ""viral video"" should be an unpredictable beast. People like what they like, and Tumbl what they Tumbl. But there's a whole industry of people paid to schlep wacky things to Internet Thought Leaders. The Can Kicks Back--its name is meant to evoke the proverbial MacGuffin that gets ""kicked down the road""--tried video interviews and got 100-odd YouTube views. It tried a visit to the Hill by a 23-year-old staffer dressed as a giant can. That earned around 3,000 views. Last week, at last, The Can Kicks Back found a hit. Former Sen. Alan Simpson, whose quotability has made him the star of the current austerity campaigns, gave a mock-patronizing (or maybe just patronizing) lecture to America's youth, asking his viewer to ""stop Instagramming your breakfast"" and start signing up friends to this hip austerity campaign, to save their money from the entitlement-loving ""coots."" Then he and the Can Man danced along to ""Gangnam Style,"" the most viral song of modern times. ""I got a bum knee!"" said Simpson, moving with some difficulty and narrating the moves. ""The lasso again, and then the horseback. Horse, horse! Ride the cowboys, ride the cowboys."" People couldn't get enough of Dancing Simpson. The performance was ""both merry and shrewd,"" according to Peggy Noonan. Simpson, whose emeritus role chairing the president's debt commission gets him plenty of free media, got even more. In the tangled and expensive world of professional austerity campaigns, this was the first media breakthrough in months. It was a little bit sad, and a bit more revealing. For 20 years, a coalition of wealthy people--Pete Peterson chief among them--has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to build public support for austerity. They have held annual summits, then semiannual summits. They've written books. They've started up coalitions. They've partnered with MTV. It's been five weeks since Barack Obama was re-elected, and there've been two gatherings in downtown D.C., put on by Peterson-tied organizations, asking politicians to do something about that debt. But do what, exactly? Here's the current problem with Peterson-ism: As scary as it seems to liberals, as clear as it may be that Peterson wants to build momentum for entitlement cuts, the actual work of these groups has moved us no closer to those said cuts. And it's had quite some time to try. The modern era of anti-deficit pressure campaigns began in 1992. Democrats, at that time, were the party that panicked over budget deficits, warning voters that these shortfalls would bankrupt the entitlements they loved. Ross Perot's campaign for president was predicated on ""shared sacrifice"" to cut the then-$4 trillion debt. When Paul Tsongas quit the Democratic primary, he joined Peterson to found the deficit-hawkish Concord Coalition, up and running when Bill Clinton won the presidency. After the election, Greenberg-Quinlan released a complicated poll of public attitudes on deficit fixes. One thousand and one voters were given a menu of budget items and asked whether to cut them or increase them, and by how much. Voters were ready to hike taxes on pollution by 225 percent, on alcohol by 33 percent, and on corporations by 18 percent.  They wanted massive cuts to foreign aid (35 percent), nuclear weapons (27 percent), and defense (17 percent). But they wanted to increase spending on Social Security and Medicare by 1 percent. The deficit hawks' goal: Inform the public of its wrongness, and move those numbers toward balance. In Facing Up, a 1993 Concord Coalition manifesto, Peterson argued for raising the full-retirement age to 67, for an ""affluence test"" to make the wealthy pay more for Medicare, for higher Medicare premiums, and for more taxes on benefits. He argued for a bunch of programs that Democrats would like, too, but honed in on entitlements because, clearly, there could be no future if they survived intact. ""The Clinton plan doesn't come close to balancing the budget, even in the near term,"" wrote Peterson. ""Inevitably, Clinton's deficit path will mean a much larger public debt."" Five years later, Clinton was presiding over a balanced budget and a smaller public debt. The professional deficit hawks responded by switching up their messaging--instead of an immediate fix to a current crisis, they wanted a fix to a looming crisis. The permanent class of austerity campaigners evolved, and grew less relevant. By 2004, Peterson was telling Businessweek that ""the Republicans have become a far more theological, faith-directed party,"" with no concern for what they were doing to the deficit. But by February 2008, he was seeding the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a media-savvier reboot of Concord (which is still alive and kicking). Thus began a bold, big-spending new era of austerity campaigns. The Peterson Foundation joined Concord, which joined the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, whose president Maya MacGuineas had joined the New America Foundation, where she often found herself on the side of the Peterson-supported Committee for Economic Development. In 2010, the Peterson Foundation funded a national awareness tour on the need for entitlement cuts and ran ads touting a foolish phony presidential candidate who wouldn't cut anything: ""His favorite period in American history was World War II, when America's debt level reached its peak of 122% of GDP."" In 2011 and 2012, the former U.S. Comptroller General David Walker--a Peterson ally and former Peterson Foundation head--almost became a real presidential candidate. He offered his services to the theoretical supporters of Americans Elect, a $35 million effort to re-create the Perot magic by putting a third party on the ballot. There were less gimmicky ideas. Every year, starting in 2010, the Peterson Foundation gathered powerful Washingtonians for ""fiscal summits."" Starting in 2011, it appealed to left-right think tanks to come up with long-term budget plans. They diverged wildly, as you'd expect when you ask the Roosevelt Institute and the Heritage Foundation to independently solve the same problem. But in its 2011 progress report--one of the most deliriously optimistic documents of this kind--the Peterson Foundation pointed out that ""their plans showed a remarkable consensus on several key priorities,"" and that the ball had thus been moved downfield. Whether that makes any sense whatsoever, you can appreciate how much it cost. According to Ryan Grim and Paul Blumenthal, Peterson's four-year commitment to his new foundation totaled $458 million. They made those calculations before this summer, when two new Peterson-aided groups emerged--Fix the Debt and The Can Kicks Back. The latter group was actually co-founded by a veteran of the David Walker presidential campaign. The former rebooted the Concord Coalition model by signing up Democrats, like former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell and Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, to make common cause with 80 CEOs. The new-new deficit hawk campaigns managed to spook liberals anew. The Fix the Debt campaign became an immediate presence on cable news, set up meetings with the president, and scheduled a post-election conference--chaired by Maya MacGuineas. But when, exactly, was one of these ""education"" campaigns supposed to pay off? This August, nearly 20 years after that blockbuster Greenberg-Quinlan poll, the Associated Press-GfK poll asked voters how they preferred to fund Social Security. Did they want a benefit cut or a tax hike? The tax hike won out, 53 to 36 percent. I sat in on Fix the Debt's D.C. conference last week. Narrowly, I'd missed the main news of the day--a group of liberal protesters heckled the first speaker, Sen. Rob Portman, until he paused his speech to talk with them about Social Security cuts. But I did find David Walker, who quickly handed me a gift--a mocked-up $10 million bill, with Andrew Jackson's face on the front. It advertised his own deficit hawk group, the Comeback America Initiative. I asked Walker whether more panels and forums were actually moving the needle for his preferred reforms.* ""It serves to reinforce how a range of business leaders and others think it's vitally important,"" he said. ""Yes, you need a broader coalition, but it's great that business leaders are back in the game. They were largely missing in action for a number of years. It's fantastic that they're back in the game!"" Walker sat down as Sen. Max Baucus, chairman of the finance committee, rose to give his speech. Half of the text consisted of football analogies. The other half reiterated the Democrats' desire to raise the top tax rate and raise the debt limit with no strings--and to defend entitlements by attacking health care costs, not payouts. ""Shifting costs to seniors is not the solution,"" said Baucus. It sounded like Peterson et al had constructed a Trojan horse, then failed to pay attention as the Greeks piled inside. During a break, I went to grab water at the conference's breakfast table. Also grabbing a water, bypassing the complimentary coffee cake, was Alice Rivlin. The former OMB director, a veteran of the Obama era's major fiscal task forces, wanted to know whether I'd seen the protests. ""The problem is that the liberal groups think this is a plot against them, that someone's going to cannibalize Medicare tomorrow,"" she said. ""That's just not part of the conversation."" I asked her whether this umpteenth meeting of the minds was going to help at all. ""There's been an awful lot of panels,"" she laughed, ""and I feel like I've been on all of 'em.""

Why Peter Peterson and 20 Years of Anti-Deficit Campaigns Have Failed	['Tsongas', 'Clinton', 'Hill', 'Paul', 'Ross', 'Peterson', 'Simpson', 'Obama']	[]
8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/12/harvard_s_campaign_decision_makers_conference_barack_obama_and_mitt_romney.html	"You've probably moved on from the 2012 presidential election. It's clear that the Republican Party is trying to. Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio both gave high-profile speeches Tuesday in which they showed they had learned the lessons of Mitt Romney's loss. ""Both parties tend to divide Americans into 'our voters' and 'their voters,' "" said Ryan, sounding a little bit like Barack Obama circa 2008 and nothing like Mitt Romney, who was secretly recorded telling donors that 47 percent of the country wouldn't vote for him because they considered themselves victims. ""Republicans must steer far clear of that trap."" Sen. Rubio spoke at the same dinner as Ryan. Rubio mentioned the middle class 34 times in his half-hour speech, which may qualify him for a special badge of some sort.* Before you move on to 2016, though, there is one important trove of information about the last presidential race that was just made available. Harvard's Institute of Politics has released the audio of last week's Campaign Decision Makers Conference. This is the powwow of the vanquished and victorious that has taken place every four years at Harvard since 1972. The top strategists from both sides sit across vast stretches of white tablecloth and discuss the battle they just waged. Everyone was showered, shaven, and showed the benefits of sleep they had missed for the last 18 months. Most were on the cusp of long vacations in pricey locales. As a result, mostly everyone was polite (damn it!). Still, it was informative. Why revisit Thanksgiving when we've already hung half the Christmas lights? Because the shape for the final script of 2012 will determine how the participants in the 2016 conference run their races. Those of us who participated in the gathering were asked to keep our notebooks closed until Harvard posted the material. Now that it's available to all, here are the most illuminating disclosures: How Damaging Was 47 Percent? When Mitt Romney was recorded writing off the 47 percent of the electorate who planned to vote for Obama, was it a gaffe or a window into his belief system? Romney worked hard to argue during the last two months of the campaign that it was just a gaffe, but speaking to donors in a private conversation after he'd lost, Romney seemed to reaffirm the philosophy. He was recorded saying that the president had won, in part, because he had given ""gifts"" to certain constituencies. When Romney's team was asked about the famous 47 percent remarks in Cambridge, they were still spinning. They did not embrace Ryan's view that the comments were symptomatic of a political instinct that seeks to divide the country but treated them like an unfortunate slip of the tongue. ""Unfortunately campaigns are long, laborious processes at times, and there's many a fundraiser,"" said Romney's campaign manager Matt Rhoades. ""The governor was very good the second go-around to make less of these kinds of mistakes, but nobody is perfect ... [Romney] can be somewhat streaky. He is the kind of candidate who can put it out of the park ... often times his political skills are underestimated. ... He was starting to get his mojo, and this event happened, and it was unfortunate."" The Romney team wasn't the only one that noticed that their candidate was improving. Just before the video was released in September, the Obama team had noticed that Romney was starting to improve as a candidate. ""His performance improved dramatically in September,"" said Obama's chief strategist David Axelrod. ""He very clearly was more relaxed, more connecting, and his rhetoric was broader and more inclusive."" Romney's improvement was showing up in the polling and focus groups, too. The Obama team had always relied on Romney being unable to speak to the middle class and those other key constituencies both campaigns were pursuing: disillusioned 2008 Obama voters, independents, and undecided voters. In early September that was changing. ""What we began to hear in mid-September, which we had never heard before, was people referring to Romney as 'relatable,' "" said Obama's director of opinion research David Simas. ""As soon as they start saying 'that's a different guy than what I have learned,' then that becomes a moment when we all start to pay more attention."" Once the 47 percent comment came out, Rhoades said Romney showed his character under the pressure. ""There was a lot of negativity about our campaign as a whole, but he's a person who takes personal responsibility,"" Rhoades said. ""He would tell me: 'You didn't say 47 percent, Matt. Stuart [Stevens] didn't say 47 percent. I did.'"" (Unresolved, perhaps for all time, is the issue of whether Romney feels he needs to take responsibility for the underlying worldview.) Romney's improvement with voters halted. ""We saw it almost immediately in the verbatims,"" said the campaign's pollster Neil Newhouse using the shorthand term for voter quotes gleaned through polls and focus groups. ""You saw it in the numbers ... this was a challenging time for us."" The Obama campaign in Chicago saw the same nosedive. ""In focus groups we started hearing Romney's lines [from the video] repeated back: 'I don't have to be concerned with those people,' "" said Simas. ""What we started hearing in the focus groups was a recognition of the story they had been hearing about him earlier in the summer. It was reaffirming this piece that he was beginning to cure."" But while the video may have stopped Romney's ability to cure his aloof and out-of-touch image, the Obama strategists say it was not the boon that people thought at the time. ""Those people were not moving toward Obama but moving away from Romney,"" said Simas of the changing in polling in the aftermath. These were voters who would eventually move back to Romney. ""No one believed us at the time,"" says Obama deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter. ""We were saying that as this 2 percent moved away from Romney it wasn't ours. The race was closer than people thought at the time."" Immigration Regrets: Mitt Romney won only 27 percent of the Hispanic vote. Was this his fault or a sign of a larger flaw in the party that encourages its candidates to compete to be ever tougher on undocumented residents to win primaries? (False choice, you may be saying: Both can be true! Fine, but figuring out what happened in the last election will help Republicans figure out how they're going attract more Hispanic voters for the cycles to come.) Romney campaign manager Rhoades said he regretted that Romney had moved so far to the right on immigration during the primaries in order to out-flank Texas Gov. Rick Perry. ""In retrospect,"" Rhoades said, ""I believe we probably could have just beaten Perry with the Social Security hit."" It wasn't clear exactly what Rhoades regretted. It might have been simply that he wishes he'd anticipated Perry's quick implosion. Why have Romney risk doing anything that might hurt him later if the target of the attack was going to collapse so spectacularly anyway? It didn't seem that Rhoades regretted Romney's policy positions per se. Romney backed a program of ""self-deportation"" in which enforcement of immigration laws would be so onerous that the undocumented would leave the country voluntarily. That set him apart from his Republican rivals, but many believe it made it impossible for Romney to ever reach out to Hispanic voters. This immigration problem didn't begin and end with Perry. Even after Perry got out of the race, Romney vowed that he would veto the Dream Act if Congress passed it when he was president.  These were what Axelrod called Romney's ""Faustian bargains,"" positions Romney needed to take to secure the nomination but that came back to haunt him in the general election. ""When you're running for the nomination,"" Rhoades said, ""you've got to win the nomination. If you're looking beyond securing the nomination too much, you are jeopardizing your chances of winning the nomination."" Triple-Screen Polling: The Romney campaign was shocked on election night. Advisers had predicted that Romney would win decisively. That confidence was based largely on their polling, which was based on a generous interpretation of the electorate. The Obama campaign, by contrast, had several different streams of polling information coming in. This allowed Obama's camp to more accurately understand what the undecided electorate was thinking and what their voters believed, so they could hone the president's message and the scripts volunteers would use on the doorstep when canvassing. Obama's main pollster Joel Benenson would put together one round of data from the battleground states. The campaign also hired pollsters with expertise in specific battleground states to do a second poll. Then, each night, the campaign itself polled 9,000 people in battleground states. Simas also had his own little private poll of undecided voters he checked in with and rotated regularly during the campaign. (We had a group like that, too!) According to Simas, in order to test their polling methods, they then called in polling experts to deconstruct the three different sets of polls and recommend how they could do it better. Each time a new public poll came out, members of the Obama polling unit looked at its assumptions in order to determine if the public poll had a better understanding of the public than the campaign. That gave them confidence to stick with their numbers and ignore a lot of the public noise. ""It just becomes a big horse-race story,"" said Axelrod of the campaign coverage, ""and you guys don't even know where the horses are."" (Wait, this is a race of horses?) Conventions Do Matter: Discussing the Democratic convention, Romney pollster Newhouse said it had a big effect not just on the horse-race polls but on the way that people felt about the country. ""I got really tired of reading verbatim comments from voters praising the Democratic convention for weeks afterwards,"" he said. ""What their convention did, which we didn't expect, was we saw a change in mood of the country--right direction and wrong track. We saw a change in economic optimism just as result of the Democratic convention. We don't expect that. It was remarkable. There was a measurable change in the mood of the country. We were dealing with that for the first 15 days of September."" The net benefit after the two conventions was enough to give the Obama team confidence to engage heavily in Florida, a state they were not going to fully commit to until they saw how things stood in early September. ""The Florida decision was a big decision for us,"" said campaign manager Jim Messina. ""It was a $40 million decision and decided right after the convention we were going to go and go hard. That was a big moment. ... They didn't do enough to fix their Latino problem in their convention--although I thought Rubio gave a great speech. We looked at that and said, 'We're going all the way in in Florida.' "" Eastwood Disaster: Blame another problem on the weather. Clint Eastwood--who gave a rambling, distracting, and artistically sloppy performance on Romney's big night at the GOP convention--was originally scheduled to speak the night before Romney. But Hurricane Isaac cut the convention by a day and put him on the final night right before the nominee. Campaign aides expected him to reprise a speech he'd given at two fundraisers, but as has been reported, he pulled an audible at the last minute. ""You're going to talk about what you talked about at these fundraisers?"" Romney's senior adviser Russ Schriefer recalled asking Eastwood earlier that night. ""He said, 'Yup.' It's Clint Eastwood! You try arguing with him."" Facebook Friends Help: In 2008, the Obama campaign did an analysis that concluded that 99 percent of the people the campaign contacted by email voted for Obama. ""We went into this campaign with the understanding that anyone we were talking to directly, the vast preponderance were going to vote for us,"" said Teddy Goff, Obama's digital director. ""And so the question was not 'How can we serve them with content that will make them vote?' but 'How can we serve them with content and an experience and tools and resources and information that is going to make them go out and get their friends [to vote]?' ... Of Barack Obama's now 33 million Facebook fans globally, they are friends with 98 percent of the U.S.-based Facebook population."" Paul Ryan Was Good for Obama in Wisconsin: According to Jeremy Bird, the Obama team's field captain, Romney choosing Ryan as his running mate fired up the troops. ""Paul Ryan helped us in Wisconsin. Our folks in Wisconsin were totally demoralized. They had just gone through all these recalls, and we'd lost. It was the hardest state for us to mobilize our volunteers. ... Paul Ryan regalvanized all of our troops in Wisconsin in a way that no other pick would have. You saw the polling numbers say that Wisconsin was getting closer, but for our folks it was a boost ... in a way that we didn't see coming."" He was also great for the campaign's work in social media. ""He was highly meme-able,"" says Goff. Romney's ""Manhattan Project"": Romney referred to his debate preparation by the code name used for the secret project to build the atomic bomb. He knew the debates would be important long before the first debate became the key to his comeback. In September, the video of Romney writing off 47 percent of the electorate surfaced. His campaign, already under siege for lack of direction, constructed a five-part plan for revitalizing itself. The most important part of it was doing well in the first debate. Incredibly, Romney had been preparing since June. ""We knew whatever was happening that we'd need a winning jolt,"" said Beth Myers, Romney's senior adviser. In the end, Romney did 16 mock debates. ""The way he gets relaxed and loose and comfortable was being prepared,"" Myers said. During the Democratic convention, Romney participated in ""debate camp,"" five mock debates in three days. ""Then, for fun at night, we'd do white-board sessions,"" said Myers. Romney Was Always No. 1 in Obamaland: Romney campaign advisers said they knew the primary would be a long slog, but they were not prepared for each primary to be treated as a ""make or break"" moment for the candidate. That wore on the staff and made them a little frazzled by the general election. If only they could have called the Obama campaign. Every Friday pollsters and strategists in Chicago ranked the GOP candidates. Romney was always No. 1, even as Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry, Herman Cain, and Rick Santorum had their moments. That revelation was like many during last week's sessions at Harvard, where the men and women who had kept so many secrets finally let us in on a few of them. Two-thirds of the way through the fifth of a planned six sessions, the electricity went out in Cambridge. The Obama and Romney staff kept talking, while those of us who had covered the campaign tried to make out who was saying what. It was a fitting end to the campaign, where the most interesting stuff always happened in the dark. Correction, Dec. 6, 2012: This article originally misattributed a quote from Paul Ryan--""Republicans must steer far clear of that trap""--to Marco Rubio. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"	The Secret Fears That Kept Obama and Romney's Strategists Up at Night	['Perry', 'Romney', 'Rubio', 'Newhouse', 'Paul', 'Obama']	[]
9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/12/rootscamp_meet_the_hip_geeks_who_beat_mitt_romney_and_helped_barack_obama.html	"Near the end of August, when it was stubbornly behind President Obama in the polls, Mitt Romney's campaign released a TV ad about the ""gutting"" of welfare's work requirements. The killer verb came from a Richmond Times-Dispatch editorial: ""Welfare Reform GUTTED,"" adapted and splayed across the screen in a font size usually reserved for stuff like ""Nixon Resigns"" or ""Japan Surrenders."" On Saturday, I sat in one of the Washington Convention Center's dark and anonymous meeting rooms and learned just how badly that ad had failed. The lesson was part of RootsCamp, an annual post-election conference of Democratic/progressive campaigners put on by the New Organizing Institute. My teachers were media trackers from the Democratic National Committee, young quants who repeatedly, politely pleaded with reporters to keep quotes and hard numbers off the record. They did share two maps. The first one showed the media markets where the ""gutting"" ad ran--Virginia and some spillover in Maryland and North Carolina, colored in faded purple to measure the impact. The second showed the states where media coverage informed voters that the ad was false. Purple-mountained majesty spread from coast to coast, with states far outside the Romney ad zone learning of, then loathing, the Romney message. Why didn't anybody else get that at the time? The titles of the next slide answered my question. We can get outspent and still win.  Media doesn't understand how media works. So, Democrats outsmarted the Romney campaign. The Republican had more money and won plenty of news cycles. (He outspent Obama in every swing state except Ohio.) Republican super PACs raised more than their Democratic counterparts. The GOP claimed to double or triple its ""voter contacts"" in key states. Democrats won anyway, because they'd figured out whom to spend money on, and how. RootsCamp might be the first political conference I've been to where some people wore purely ironic buttons--Romney-Ryan swag, tributes to a forever-vanquished enemy. Most mega-meetings in downtown D.C. bring an alien-looking group of Americans dressed in comfy convention clothes or black suits. The RootsCamp's crowd, 2,000 strong, looked like the casting pool for a party scene on Girls. There was no glossy schedule. Activists learned of panels and breakout talks by checking a smartphone app or visiting The Wall, a monolith decorated with 8-by-11 titles and descriptions. Among them: ""Inglorious Voters,"" ""#whitepeopleproblems,"" and ""Unfuck Fostercare."" On the third floor, any victorious activist still looking for a job could meet potential employers. On the first floor, he could meet with his peers from Obama for America or MoveOn and discover what cheap tricks had bested the rich guys. On Friday, they packed the room for a panel titled ""This Shit Actually Works,"" where MoveOn revealed the results of a voter turnout experiment demo-ed in Delaware's sleepy September primary. MoveOn wanted to test what sort of generic-looking mail was most effective for getting a possible voter off the couch--a ""best practices"" appeal to their civic duty or ""social pressure"" that compared a voter with his neighbors. Daniel Mintz showed the crowd an old attempt at social pressure, a list of neighbors and their scores that ""looked like crap."" Then he revealed MoveOn's ""voter report card."" Featuring smiling stock-photo children, it revealed how often the target had voted and how often his neighbors had voted. ""Turnout for the control group was control 19.3 percent,"" Mintz revealed. ""Turnout for 'best practices' was 21.5 percent. Among people who got the 'social pressure' mail, turnout was 22.8 percent."" The point wasn't really to convince new voters to choose Obama. It was to activate the soft voters who Democrats knew were out there. In theory, Republicans could have ripped this off. My colleague Sasha Issenberg has reported, all year, about the stat-geek techniques used by Democrats to tune up the standard tricks of get-out-the-vote campaigns and voter persuasion. Plenty of the RootsCampers I talked to had stories from losing campaigns, dating back to the Kerry 2004 debacle, when there was no real science about TV ads. The left had evolved faster than the right had evolved. Jeremy Bird, the national field director for OFA, told his Saturday audience of a plan that synched up perfectly with MoveOn and labor. ""As we got to the end, there were really only two things that mattered,"" said Bird. ""How many folks are registering to vote? Who are those people, and who's turning out for the early vote? All the other stuff is inputs. Those were the two things that told us: Are we changing the electorate, and are our voters turning out?"" The organizing was valued over the ads. Meanwhile, the Romney campaign and the Super PACs were blowing wads of cash on ads that washed right over people. In the OFA session, Bird called on former volunteers--alternating the genders, boy-girl-boy-girl--to get fresh anecdotes on what worked and what would no longer work. One Iowa organizer revealed that phone calls had become nearly useless for reaching college students. Bird asked the crowd, all 20-somethings and 30-somethings, how many of them had landline phones. One woman raised her hand, in a crowd of a hundred people. The landline wasn't coming back, either, said OFA's Marlon Marshall, and that was going to be true ""in eight years, when we turn Texas blue."" Bird pointed out that the contact rate on all phones had fallen from 23 percent in 2008 to 16 percent in 2012. He derided the idea of ""massive call centers"" in central locations. I had a flashback to all the time I'd spent talking to Tea Party groups, proudly expanding their phone call outreach to voters. Standing near me, reflecting on even weightier problems, was Republican consultant Patrick Ruffini. He was one of the GOP's original digital gurus, building the 2004 Bush campaign's hub before going private. He spent the RootsCamp weekend flitting from panel to panel, finding out how his movement had lost so badly. The Legend of Ruffini spread on Twitter. Some panelists redacted their remarks when he was in the room, just as they blacked out key data when reporters were taking notes. He recorded the sessions with tweets, pointing out all the tricks that worked. The tone of these tweets alternated between the respectful and the envious. Universal takeaway: OFA state field staff are sharp. As the conference ended: Takeaway from #roots12: The socially awkward do it better. Later, he saw a report from Boston. Strategists for the Obama and Romney campaigns were there for a quadrennial, back-slapping debriefing with reporters. They ate ""chicken pot pie and mashed sweet potatoes"" and said things like ""we weren't even running in the same race."" Ruffini had to rub it in: They weren't even at RootsCamp."

Nice access to the roof. Clean escape route for caterers. More TV screens than you need unless you're brainwashing some droogs. I first visited the seventh floor in early 2010, when it was taken over for the launch of a new magazine, Fiscal Times. Funded in part by Pete Peterson, the former commerce secretary turned finger-in-every-pot austerity guru, the magazine had soft-launched with a series of pieces about the momentum for spending cuts. That night, as bartenders mixed our drinks, Peterson told us that the age of fiscal responsibility was at hand, and we'd all be there to cover it. This Tuesday, I returned to the Newseum conference rooms to watch Republicans end the austerity movement. The Foreign Policy Initiative, a think tank that has been amplifying the voices of conservative hawks since 2009, gathered friends and media to talk about the challenges of the second Obama term. First among them: defense cuts, the ones in the ""sequester"" of the 2011 debt-limit deal. Republicans needed to stop them. Sen. Jon Kyl, the retiring GOP whip from Arizona, informed us that he'd been going back over his papers and rediscovering great wisdom. ""Ronald Reagan, he had a lot of great stuff,"" said Kyl. ""And one of the things he said was: You know, I've seen a lot of wars in my life. None of them were caused because we were too strong."" And according to Kyl, America could not be strong if it allowed the sequester to bite down. The final debt deal, supported by a majority of Republicans and Democrats, offered Washington a choice between $1.2 trillion of cuts to spending and a supercommittee that would get a chance to develop smarter, less blunt cuts. The supercommittee failed, so those spending cuts--$600 billion each to defense and nondefense budgets over 10 years--are scheduled to start on Jan. 2, 2013. It's not perfect. Actually, more than that, the plan was designed to be lousy, so politicians would panic and find smarter cuts elsewhere in their budgets. But it's austerity, and for three-odd years, conservatives have been telling us we need austerity. Any less would be ""generational theft,"" the government had to balance its budget just like any household or business--and so on. You remember Glenn Beck. You heard all of this. Unfortunately, the country that conservatives want to govern can't really be austere. ""Part of the price of leadership is having an adequate defense to meet the commitments you have around the world,"" said Kyl. ""I was chatting with people in the reception room, reminiscing,"" said Bill Kristol, the Weekly Standard editor and FPI co-founder. ""I was in government 20 years ago. We could not do the first Gulf War now."" ""Right!"" said Kyl. ""Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait on Aug. 1, 1990,"" said Kristol. ""We had 500,000 troops in Saudi Arabia Maybe we didn't need 500,000, but it was a nice margin of comfort, and that war went pretty well, and it was a pretty good model. Maybe it ended a bit early, but that's another story."" We haven't heard this sort of reminiscing for a while. Since 2010, the most cited cliche about security and spending came from Adm. Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who told an Ohio audience that the national debt was the ""greatest threat to national security."" Kyl flipped that around: ""You can't have a strong economy unless you have a strong defense."" Sure, this was a retiring Republican talking. He might leave the Senate and devote himself to more lucrative campaigns for military spending, and he wouldn't be the first defense hawk to do so. But every other Republican on the stage was with him. Tom Cotton, an incoming congressman from Arkansas, said that voters ""kind of intuitively understand"" that when ""you've got to fund the government, the first priority is a real strong military."" Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois freshman, warned that America could lose wars only if Americans had ""our will defeated."" The 2007 surge into Iraq was a perfect example of a bigger, bolder military: ""It was not necessarily the addition of 20,000 troops, it was the message it sent."" Whether the sequester survives or falls, this is mainstream Republican opinion. A fiscal hawk like Rand Paul can talk about ""jettisoning some of the crap"" in the military budget, and he'll draw curious reporters into his tractor beam. But seven months ago, nearly every House Republican voted to restore all the lost defense spending, finding the cuts in welfare programs instead. It's an awkward position to be in, because it puts the lie to the whole ""fiscal cliff"" concept. The ""fiscal crisis"" of 2009 onward was, allegedly, the national debt. A ""cliff"" sounds like the sort of thing you teeter over in a major crisis. And yet ""going over the cliff"" means accepting $1.2 trillion in cuts--more than $200 billion in 2013--and bringing back tax rates that raised more revenue than the current rates. It would be, by miles, the most significant whack at the deficit in American history. It would also wreck the economy, even though Republicans said in 2010 and 2011 that a tighter budget would in itself help the economy. ""Keynesian economists believe that if the government doesn't spend money, bad times ensue,"" explained Kyl. ""I reject that. They are correct that these automatic across-the-board cuts to both the nondefense discretionary part of the budget and the defense part would be devastating. I just disagree on the reasons why."" But he didn't give an alternate reason. There really isn't one. Republicans in areas affected by defense cuts campaigned against them. The hawkish, interventionist wing of the party can't succeed if the cuts aren't stopped. The most forward-looking part of the FPI's conference came when the French philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy chatted with Sen. John McCain. They quickly agreed that America needed to intervene in Syria, setting up a partial no-fly zone and arming rebels. ""War weariness is a big factor,"" said McCain, griping about the possible opposition. ""People are very weary, and there's a fear of getting into a prolonged conflict."" But that would be overcome. So would the defense cuts. ""I know you cannot deal without that,"" said Levy after the panel. ""I know you cannot neglect this aspect of things. It is not my specialty, but I am realistic. I am pragmatic. I knew, during the Libyan war, how important it was to take into account the pragmatic aspect of things. So we cannot just make idealistic preachings--but my thought is that the cost is greater if you do not do it."" Republicans agree with the French philosopher on this one: No more cuts!"	Austerity?

11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/grover_norquist_tax_pledge_are_republicans_breaking_the_taxpayer_protection.html	"Grover Norquist is used to it by now. A reporter corners a Republican on the tax extensions/debt deal/fiscal cliff. The reporter asks: Will you break the Taxpayer Protection Pledge and consider raising taxes? The Republican waffles, and the reporter's next call is to Norquist, the president of Americans of Tax Reform, to see whether a heresy has been committed. ""Somebody answers a hypothetical--would you raise taxes a teeny bit if someone would give you a jillion dollars of entitlement reform?"" says Norquist, taking a few minutes to talk between ""some cable news things"" on Monday. ""That's the question that Sen. Lindsey Graham keeps getting."" Over the weekend, Graham had joined the latest round of the game by going on ABC News and appearing to break the pledge, which puts its signatories on record against any net tax increase. ""I think Grover is wrong when it comes to we can't cap deductions and buy down debt,"" said Graham. ""I will violate the pledge, long story short, for the good of the country, only if Democrats will do entitlement reform."" The Washington Post called this a ""break with Grover Norquist."" That wasn't how Norquist saw it. ""I've talked to Lindsey Graham on the phone after some of his pronouncements, and he's said: 'Oh, I would need 10-1 [ratio of cuts to tax hikes], and it would have to include permanent, unalterable entitlement reform.' I said: 'Lindsey, if that's what it's going to take to get you to raise taxes, I'm not going to worry about you. You are not in danger of being offered a silver unicorn, because unicorns don't exist.' "" The existence of the pledge, and of Norquist, turns coverage of big tax deals into something resembling a Brothers Grimm fairly tale. Will a Republican say the magic word and break the pledge? If he does, surely, the GOP's anti-tax edifice will tumble over. Only 212 members of the incoming Congress have signed the pledge, which means that the power is fading--which means that Republicans will soon be free. ""Everyone acts,"" writes Rich Lowry, ""as if Grover is the instrument of the party's Babylonian captivity."" This is too easy, which means that it's wrong. Republicans have mostly mastered the buzzwords of fiscal policy in general and the fiscal cliff specifically. Reporters, for all of the obvious reasons, crank up the headlines and ""Breaking News ""chyrons, when they hear those buzzwords. But as my colleague John Dickerson has pointed out, the Republicans now denouncing Norquist's pledge don't represent a critical mass of tax-hike votes. Graham has talked like this for years, as has Georgia Sen. Saxby Chambliss. And yet there hasn't been any great compromise that raised taxes. If you were a cynic, you might think that the great GOP moderates were using the pledge to play the press. And if they were doing that, how would they pull it off? Why, they'd use the sorts of words that imply a separation from GOP tax dogma, but in a way that doesn't actually worry Norquist. I asked Norquist to thumb through the key buzzwords and buzz-phrases and explain why they don't spook him. New revenue. John Boehner kicked off the latest Norquist Games on Nov. 7, when he said that Republicans were ""willing to accept new revenue, under the right conditions."" It didn't worry anti-tax activists because they understand that Boehner wants this revenue with no further tax hikes. The ""right conditions"" are, basically, Republican policies. ""If you mean revenue through growth, you should say revenue through growth, as Boehner does,"" says Norquist. ""If you mean tax increases, say tax increases."" Everything is on the table. Norquist gives Republicans a pass on this one. He doesn't hear it and assume they're going to serve themselves hot to Chuck Schumer. ""This means: 'I'm terribly reasonable and I'm not committed to anything,'"" he says. ""What the other person is supposed to hear is: I'm a cheap date."" But it's fine to treat it as a ruse. Dynamic scoring. Democrats actually try to pre-empt this one. In his post-election presser, President Obama named ""dynamic scoring"" among the ""vague"" ideas he doesn't take seriously. He had to, because Republicans like to sound gettable on a tax deal by arguing that cuts will pay for themselves--they should be ""scored"" to reflect that. ""It's usually used by conservatives to mean: Cut the capital gains tax, because every time we've done that, we've brought in more revenue,"" says Norquist. ""You should be able to score it that way. If the government went to a 25 percent corporate income tax, I believe they'd get more revenue. Democrats don't like it because it makes tax cuts on capital and mobile labor actually free."" Closing loopholes. Paul Ryan got through an entire campaign for vice president by promising to ""close tax loopholes"" without ever saying which ones he meant. It didn't really work for him, but it lets Republicans start at ground zero now and suggest that ""loopholes"" that currently lead to lower taxes for some people might be killable. ""Democrats consider the differential on capital gains to be a loophole,"" says Norquist. ""Republicans consider tax credits for favored industries to be loopholes. Sometimes they're not talking about the same things. Actually, a loophole is something you shoot at the enemy through."" And until he hears a Republican say he'll kill a loophole without getting some concession on tax rates, he doesn't worry. A Simpson-Bowles approach. Norquist spent most of a year attacking the Simpson-Bowles commission, its recommendations, and its adherents. Like Obi-Wan Kenobi, in death Simpson-Bowles has only grown stronger. On Wednesday, Erskine Bowles himself will come to Captiol Hill to meet with John Boehner and give yet more cover for a plan that--in the punditocracy's understanding--raises tax rates. Norquist doesn't sweat it. He points to the argument Paul Ryan made when he gave the thumbs-down to Simpson-Bowles: ""The revenue increases called for in this proposal are simply too high and threaten to stifle the very growth needed for economic prosperity and fiscal stability."" If ""Bowles-Simpson"" is code for ""I'm reasonable,"" the Republican is using it as cover to keep his pledge. But why would Republicans bring up Simpson-Bowles at all? They need to sound reasonable, and they can't sound like they're precipitating a crisis. According to a CNN poll, 45 percent of voters are ready to blame Republicans if there's no spending/tax deal by Dec. 31, and only 34 percent of voters expect to blame Barack Obama. This is the legacy of the debt-limit crisis. This is why Republicans now denounce the pledges and associations that make them look unreasonable. Norquist doesn't take it personally. ""The clearer you get in the wording, the less agreement there is,"" says Norquist. That's why, at the beginning of these things, they all have this huge fudge factor, and that's why they hate the pledge. If you don't want the government to get bigger, the goddamn pledge is written down, and doesn't change, and has words that mean what they say, and you can't get around a commitment against a net tax increase."""

12	12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/citizens_united_massive_political_campaign_donations_during_the_roman_republic.html	"Two years after the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United, which allowed unlimited corporate and union money into American politics, there is one line that continues to echo: ""The appearance of influence or access ... will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy."" That line lasts because it's a testable prediction. It's not a question of precedent or constitutional interpretation, but of public opinion--and as such, we all feel competent to judge it. Loss of faith, the Supreme Court allowed, is itself an argument against our increasingly unregulated campaign spending regime. Of course, democratic faith is a slippery concept. But it is always on display in an election's aftermath. In the best case, the election's winners and losers have a shared, if grudging, agreement about the fairness of the process and its outcome. In the worst case, the winner's legitimacy is just one more ""fact"" to disagree about. Does massive campaign spending move us closer to the worst case? One view of the 2012 election holds that super PACs proved far less effective than feared. ""But ultimately,"" argues Nicholas Confessore in the New York Times, ""Mr. Obama did not beat the super PACs; he joined them."" His re-election, therefore, doesn't settle the question raised by the Supreme Court; it simply postpones it. Rather than letting the Citizens United experiment in confidence play out over the next several elections, we can find evidence now, by looking to political history. How has the ""appearance of influence"" affected faith in other elected governments? History tells us that such faith is far easier to tear down than to rebuild. And one of the best examples of this faith under strain comes from one of the earliest experiments in elected government: the Roman Republic. Our political culture is saturated with historical appeals to the founders, but when the founders themselves wanted to make such appeals, they turned overwhelmingly to Rome. As inspiration and as practical example, that republic's history is written into our own. For Alexander Hamilton, the republic represented ""the utmost height of human greatness."" The authors of the Federalist Papers cited the republic as an influence on the American Constitution 14 separate times. In early America, Rome before Caesar served as the quintessential republic of virtue; its collapse was the ultimate cautionary tale of political corruption. A crucial part of that story was the corrosive influence of money in politics. To be sure, Rome was never a true democracy; its elections were always designed to heavily favor the wealthy and well-born. Further, the kind of money that consumed Roman politics--personal spending by wealthy candidates--isn't the prime source of controversy in our time. Nevertheless, the last generation of the Republic's politics was dominated by two trends: universal complaints about money's corrupting effect on politics and near universal unwillingness to do anything about it. Ancient politicians were just as skilled as modern ones at identifying and exploiting loopholes in election law. In Rome, the key loophole lay in the fuzzy distinction between ambitus (electoral bribery) and mere benignitas (generosity). Roman elections were often won on the strength of free food, drinks, entertainment, and sometimes hard cash offered directly to voters and financed by private fortunes. In fact, Roman campaign slogans were sometimes inscribed on the bottom of commemorative wine cups--you could drain the cup and find out whom to vote for. Most of the Roman elite relied on the gentleman's agreement that the line between bribery and generosity would not be strictly patrolled. At worst, rank vote-buying was something your opponents engaged in; you, on the other hand, were simply being a good neighbor. That explains the curious fact that continually rising penalties for corruption had almost no deterrent effect. Toward the republic's end, the penalty for ambitus had risen to 10 years' exile. The general Pompey, who presented himself as a clean-government advocate when he wasn't buying elections for his allies, even proposed raising the statute of limitations for corruption charges to two decades, meaning that virtually no Roman politician would be safe. Yet the money continued to flow: Politicians able to afford the massive bribes were usually able to afford protection after the fact. Worse, with no enforceable limits on spending and a heavy premium on one-upsmanship, the price of elections skyrocketed. Five years before the republic collapsed, Cicero made an astonishing claim: The wealthy had injected so much cash into election season that the interest rate in Rome temporarily doubled. Nor could the power of money be confined to election season--its influence spread throughout the republic's government. Rome had long sent politicians to govern a province after their year in office; ultimately, they felt entitled to fleece those provinces in order to recoup their election losses, a practice that spread deep resentment of the capital. The biographer Plutarch records bribery of civil servants, who were paid off to erase debts owed to the public purse. Jury verdicts, too, were regularly bought and paid for. Julius Caesar, who brought the republic to an end, walked a path to power paved by charisma and military accomplishments--and his mastery of Roman campaign-finance practices. He won his first election to Rome's highest office with the backing of a single wealthy donor (who, in exchange, planned to serve beside Caesar). And if there was a moment when civil war between Caesar and the conservative Roman Senate became inevitable, it was probably the day Caesar paid off the debts of Gaius Scribonius Curio. Curio, an up-and-coming conservative, had won election as a tribune of the people, and with it the tribune's power to veto any law. But he had heavily indebted himself along the way. Caesar satisfied his creditors, but only on the condition that Curio switch sides. From that point, Caesar, who already had an army, owned a veto in the Roman government. Political deadlock was assured. Caesar's fiercest personal enemy was also Rome's most consistent enemy of electoral corruption. Marcus Porcius Cato, a Stoic and Senate conservative, made his name denouncing the influence of money on private and public life. Yet Cato failed, just as other would-be reformers did. He obsessively cast corruption as a failing of personal morality rather than a systemic crisis, which dramatically understated both the scope of the problem and the means needed to control it. As a result, Cato's proposed remedies were usually ad hoc, and they predictably fell short. In one instance, he managed to persuade a group of candidates to appoint him as an informal election judge, with the power to investigate bribery and publicly expose any candidate he found guilty. Each pledged to forfeit money to Cato if he was caught breaking the deal. Days before the vote, an enthusiastic Cicero wrote, ""If the election proves free, as it is thought it will, Cato alone can do more than all the laws and all the judges."" On the day of the election, Cato stood before the Roman people and duly announced that one of the candidates had cheated. The rivals huddled and came to their own decision: The guilty man should be let off with no further penalty, and he should keep his money. That's how deep corruption ran in the culture of the Roman elite. Even as ambitus weakened the republic, each member of the governing class preferred a strategy of maximizing his own gains in a broken system. Vote-buying made sense for individual politicians at the same time as it undermined the elite as a whole. Cicero, for instance, passed a strong anti-corruption law and even named it after himself--and then, he secured the acquittal of the very first man charged under the law because he was a political ally. Several years later, an ex-governor was tried for extorting money from his province to finance a campaign for higher office. Six different lawyers, drawn from the cream of the Senate--the equivalent of a Roman legal Dream Team--rose to defend him. The corrupt former official was acquitted with ease. By the end, chronic election-buying had helped grind down all faith in republican government. Why was Caesar able to dissolve the republic and set Rome on a course to one-man rule? Because, in large part, enough people believed that the republic was too rotten to be worth saving. And while most classical sources dwell on the aristocracy, there's also strong evidence that ordinary Romans grew increasingly alienated from politics during the final years. Radical leaders like Catiline and Clodius drew massive followings with their attacks on a corrupt elite; their riots, in turn, helped convince much of that elite that Rome was in grave need of a strongman. Unlimited money in politics certainly doesn't guarantee riots and civil war. Nor does ""the appearance of influence"" always undermine republican government. But legitimacy matters, and it rests on a delicate understanding: the belief that those who govern have a right to govern. It's devilishly hard to measure or quantify, but (to paraphrase the Supreme Court again) we know it when we see it. How much democratic faith do Americans have today? How many liberals think George W. Bush won in 2004 because of electronic voting shenanigans in Ohio? How many conservatives think Barack Obama won in 2008 thanks to ACORN, or in 2012 because of handouts to the 47 percent? Unlimited money in politics adds one more cause for doubt, perhaps the most powerful of all, to a list that has grown in recent years. How long until we have a presidential election in which a dangerous percentage of Americans view the final result as illegitimate on account of money? On some level, Citizens United was right. It's not bought influence that's deadliest to our politics--it's the appearance of influence. We can debate dueling First Amendment readings and the real power of super PACs all we'd like; but here is a case where public opinion, on its own, should be decisive. If a loss of faith becomes wide and deep enough, the question of whether or not we are right to lose faith becomes academic. The loss is destructive either way. Just ask Rome."

David Petraeus. With that simple announcement, Obama could strike a blow for civil liberties and against the silly and destructive sexual Puritanism that has taken down so many public figures. Since Petraeus' departure both Democrats and Republicans have been mourning the loss of a public servant of extraordinary ability. So let's mourn no more. The president can say that when news of Petraeus' affair first broke he reluctantly accepted the general's resignation. But as it has become clear that the events were wholly of a private nature and national security was not breached, he is reinstating his CIA director. (OK, we probably have to wait until the CIA finishes its new investigation into whether Petraeus used agency resources to conduct the affair, but investigators have leaked that they don't expect any criminal charges.) Because Obama is a man with such a blemish-free private life, this could be a ""Nixon in China"" moment. It would be impossible for a Bill Clinton, say, to strike such a blow for sexual sanity. But given that even that insatiable sex fiend is back in the arena and much revered (by some), surely that means we have grown up enough to realize that just because you're in public life doesn't mean every aspect of your marriage is fair game. Yes, it's been titillating to read the farcical details of Petraeus' fling, and no one got more vicarious pleasure than I. But in the end the Petraeus so-called scandal is just the old story of a long-married man who strayed with a younger woman, a woman who unfortunately for all went a little nuts. I hope that for none of the participants it's a marriage ender, but it certainly should not have been a career ender. As my Slate colleague Emily Bazelon has pointed out, the real questions are not about whether Petraeus and Broadwell did it under a desk but why the FBI kept pursuing this investigation once it became clear no crime had been committed. Both Petraeus and Broadwell were interviewed by the FBI and copped to the affair. Petraeus, realizing the affair had been discovered, did not then tender his resignation. According to accounts, he didn't think he should. He must have concluded--rightly we can now see--that the matter was and should remain private and had no bearing on his ability to discharge his duties at the CIA. (Although the secret Gmail drop he set up with Broadwell does show he's not a master of spycraft.) It wasn't until some days later, according to the Washington Post, that Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. told him his behavior made him unfit for office. But does it? Now that revelations about the Tampa twins and Broadwell's mean-girl threats to her perceived romantic rival have been aired, mocked, and already forgotten, we're left wondering why we got our pants in such a twist over Petraeus dropping his. It's understandable that given the timing of this story--it broke just after the presidential election and was simultaneous with congressional investigations of the Benghazi debacle--it must have seemed prudent to not to let Petraeus become a new, possibly explosive, distraction. It probably was a good thing that Petraeus wasn't fighting for his job while testifying about Benghazi. But thanks to our ever-faster cycle of humiliation and rehabilitation, he has already been punished and paroled. It's time to let Petraeus get back to work. It would probably even please Mrs. Petraeus to see less of him around the house right now. Petraeus has already engaged the services of Robert Barnett, the Washington lawyer who gets former government officials seven-figure book deals. The word is that no book is planned, but surely Petraeus must want to tell his own version of his life. Let's hope that Obama keeps Petraeus from embarking on this next chapter by asking him to return and finish the job he started."	Obama Should Rehire Petraeus as CIA Director	['Obama']	[]

She's yet to be nominated for anything else. But the campaign to stop that nomination is chugging along from bluster to bluster, farce to farce. Peak farce seemed to come last week, when Sen. John McCain missed one of the briefings about the attack on America's consulate on Benghazi because he was in the Senate Radio-TV Gallery demanding answers on Benghazi. We topped that pretty quickly. On Sunday, McCain appeared on Face the Nation to re-re-re-demand answers from Rice. It was his sixth appearance this year on the show. Rice had hit the studio only on Sept. 16, and she hadn't called the attacks terrorism, and McCain would not let her forget it. ""I'm curious why she has not repudiated those remarks,"" McCain told Bob Schieffer. ""On this show, the Libyan national president, obviously, said it was al-Qaida."" How could she make amends, and prevent the shrunken Republican minority from filibustering a possible nomination for secretary of state? ""Maybe she could start out by publicly coming back on this show and saying, 'I was wrong, I gave the wrong information on your show some several weeks ago.' That might be a beginning."" That answer was meant to reiterate how seriously we should view the stakes in Benghazi-gate. It also revealed the munchkin size of the scandal. It is not, right now, about how Ambassador Chris Stevens warned that the consulate was ill-prepared for an attack, or how the administration didn't respond with more security, or whether help was slow to arrive on Sept. 11 when pinned-down diplomats begged for it. No. It's about the Sunday shows. Rice, who has been a future candidate for secretary of state since roughly her first lunch with Barack Obama, did all the Sept. 16 Sunday shows to deliver talking points. She claimed that the ""current best assessment"" had a protest getting ""hijacked, let us say, by some individual clusters of extremists."" Asked if it was terrorism, she dodged, even though some in the intelligence community were ready to call it that. McCain doesn't trust Rice, and he likes the idea of John Kerry--who's more respected now than he was when he lost the presidency--becoming Secretary of State. He claims that veterans are coming to him, demanding more answers on Benghazi, which sounds true. He doesn't currently control a committee that could get more answers. But he is the president-for-life of that sovereign state inside I-495: Meet the Pressistan. What better way into the story than this, a scandal that was by and for the Sunday shows? By saying that, I don't mean to minimize those shows. Meet the Press, the highest-rated of the Sunday talkfests, gets more than 3 million viewers per week. The total audience for the five shows that Rice went on--Meet the Press, Face the Nation, This Week, Fox News Sunday, State of the Union--is around 12 million, assuming that Tivo-armed viewers watch them all. At their best, these shows trip up politicians who could bolt from some less-prestigious interview that isn't intro'd by classical music. At their worst, the shows host powerful people as they spread knowing lies to further their agendas. At their most meh, they allow hacks to dispense their talking points. The Rice story has pitted a master of the genre against a dabbler. McCain hasn't just appeared on Face the Nation six times this year. He's appeared on the competing shows 14 times. In Maureen Dowd's column on the contretemps, a helpful ""administration official"" trashes Rice for trying ""to go out and close the stature gap"" as she jockeyed for State and was ""focused on the performance, not the content."" The Anonymous Official's theory: Rice should have pushed back on her talking points and been free to discuss the developing information about possible al-Qaida links to the Benghazi attack. Some analysts in the pipeline didn't want that information out there on Sept. 16. She didn't contradict them. But this is the question--and it's an uncomfortable question, if you impart great power in Sunday talk shows. So what? One theory is that Rice's ""extremists hijacked a protest"" spin was an attempt to cover up a story that could damage the president's re-election. ""The narrative was wrong,"" said Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, on Sunday's Meet the Press. ""There were some policy decisions made based on the narrative that was not consistent with the intelligence that we had."" Which policy decisions? He didn't say. McCain has insisted that the ""hijack"" talking points were a result of ""either a cover-up or incompetence."" What would a cover-up have achieved, though? Kicking the Benghazi story from mid-September, when Romney was reeling, to some uncertain time closer to the election? When the voter heard about this scandal, why would a successful terrorist attack by random extremists make him less angry than an attack by al-Qaida? The Rogers-McCain argument is that the second scenario contradicted the ""narrative,"" the Obama line that al-Qaida had been ""decimated."" But the attack had already done that job, with or without the talking points. That's the surreal part of this Sunday-morning quarterbacking. The Sept. 16 Susan Rice interviews have been compared to Condoleezza Rice's prewar interviews about Iraq. In Dowd's column (titled, naturally, ""Is Rice Cooked?""), we're told that Bush's Rice ""sold her soul"" while Obama's Rice merely ""rented"" it. But that's a little pat. The problem with Condoleezza Rice's TV interviews is that they urged along a war. ""There will always be some uncertainty about how quickly he can acquire nuclear weapons,"" said Rice in September 2002. ""But we don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud."" One month later, the House of Representatives voted for authorization of force against Iraq. That turned out to be more dangerous than a ""narrative."" But in Meet the Pressistan, all that matters is whether your talking points were skewed, and whether there's a senator ready to jump into the other chair to call you on it."

At an 11:10 a.m. press conference, held near the Capitol's statue of Will Rogers, Majority Leader Eric Cantor reintroduced the GOP's ""Plan B"" package of fiscal cliff solutions--a bill that would replace the scheduled defense cuts with cuts to social programs, and a bill that would extend the Bush tax cuts for all those with income over $1 million. A reporter asked Cantor if Republicans had the votes to push this through. ""We're going to have the votes to pass the permanent tax relief bill,"" said Cantor, ""as well as the spending reduction bill."" The roll calls were scheduled to take place seven or eight hours after the press conference. That suggested that Cantor needed more time to round up Republican support. And yet one hour later, a reporter began a question to White House spokesman Jay Carney this way: ""Majority Leader Cantor says he has enough votes to pass Speaker Boehner's plan B."" The conditional--""going to have""--had been transformed, by an inattentive observer, into the confident ""has."" The slippery, confident-but-not-certain version was true. On Thursday night, Republicans barely passed the Spending Reduction Bill of 2012--the replacement of sequestration--with 215 votes, losing 21 of their members and winning over no Democrats. That was supposed to be the popular half of Plan B. Cantor's party rushed through some meaningless bills (S. 925, ""to designate Mt. Andrea Lawrence""), then went into recess, presumably to wrangle votes. They seemed to be around 22 votes short, when 23 ""nays"" would kill the bill. When they met behind closed doors, Boehner told his members that they were done, and could go home for Christmas. Some of the ""no"" votes didn't even bother to show up, opting to attend a gumbo-themed send-off for a member who'd lost his re-election. Those who did show up heard their speaker declare defeat and recite a prayer: God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. And then it was away for Christmas. The meltdown shocked Washington, but it shouldn't have. Here are the four reasons why: This had all happened before. Boehner had failed in the exact same way just 16 months earlier. He was facing down the White House over a possible ""grand bargain"" to cut spending and raise taxes. He wanted to strengthen his hand by proving that the House could pass a compromise (but conservative-friendly) bill that raised the debt limit, and when it did, the Democratic Senate would have no ""excuses for inaction."" On July 28, 2011, Republican whip Kevin McCarthy spent hours bargaining with conservatives, adding their priorities to the plan--making it more toxic to Senate Democrats. As midnight approached, Republicans threw up their hands and postponed the vote. Hard-liners had been here before, with control of Congress, a feckless president, and a message that they wanted to sell: ""We're serious about spending cuts."" After 2011, they felt they'd traded away a good hand for nothing. They wouldn't do that twice. Republicans still don't want to raise taxes, of any kind, ever. McCarthy managed to get a narrow win on that compromise bill on July 29. That bill included no tax increases. ""Plan B"" did, and top Republicans alternately explained that 1) the increase was very small, affecting maybe 0.18 percent of Americans and 2) a worse tax hike would happen anyway, if the party did nothing, because all rates would go up on Jan. 2. ""It is not a tax increase,"" said Rep. Tom Cole to reporters, before the vote. ""It would be like saying we voted for the Bush tax cuts, and they were temporary, we voted for future tax hikes ... making them permanent is a huge victory!"" It was a clever argument that had the virtue of absolute truth. Conservatives didn't buy it. The conservative movement opposed Plan B. On Thursday morning, Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform released a statement that seemed to absolve Republicans of a pro-tax vote. Because they had ""already voted twice to prevent any tax increases on any American,"" and because this bill would ""prevent tax increases"" in January, voting for it wouldn't violate the ""no net tax increase"" pledge. Washington had spent a week or so of December casting Norquist as a conservative Merlin; now the spell was broken. But it wasn't. Norquist's outfit quickly added that this statement was ""not to be misconstrued as an endorsement of any legislation."" The feeling was contagious. FreedomWorks initially offered ""two cheers"" to the plan, congratulating Boehner for apparently abandoning fruitless talks with Obama. Later in the day, it swung back--it would oppose the vote and count ""ayes"" against Republican candidates. The Club for Growth, the group with the best record of unseating moderate Republicans, always opposed the vote. Rush Limbaugh called the plan a ""cave,"" and if the party went there, it was ""agreeing to raise taxes on the rich under the premise that the problems exist because the rich got their tax cut in the first place and therefore haven't been paying their fair share."" And Heritage Action, the campaign arm of the think tank soon to be run by Sen. Jim DeMint, warned of the same dark consequences. The Chamber of Commerce wanted Republicans to get behind Plan B. That tells you everything you need to know about who matters to House conservatives. No one fears the ""fiscal cliff."" On Sept. 29, 2008, the Democratic House failed to pass TARP. The Dow Jones Index ended the day down 777 points. On July 27, 2011, one of the days when Boehner's Republicans punted on a debt deal, the Dow plunged 199 points. The markets haven't responded to the ""fiscal cliff"" this way. Stock prices are generally up since the Nov. 6 election. On Thursday night, I asked outgoing House Rules Chairman David Dreier why that was. ""I follow the market very, very closely,"" he said. ""I follow it throughout the day. There is a sense that something is going to get done, and from people I talk to in the market, in that business. It stops being true by the end of next week. But there's a possibility we go over and we're able to come back. The market reaction wouldn't be very positive, but as long as there's an end in sight, if it happens in mid-January--it depends on the details."" Dreier, who retired this year, will be gone by then. Among the 215 ""ayes"" for the sequester replacement, the test vote that barely passed, were 25 Republicans who won't be in the next Congress. Nineteen of the 22 members who voted ""no"" or ""present"" will still be around in January. None of them fear John Boehner."

There are two ways to kill a policy idea in Washington: Broaden it to include every interested person with an opinion, or appoint a commission. If you broaden it, it quickly becomes a cacophonous mess, and everyone throws up his or her hands. Commissions, almost by design, are where action goes for a nap. So when President Obama unveiled his preliminary response to the Newtown, Conn., massacre in his news conference on Wednesday--a commission headed by Vice President Joe Biden to drum up some wide-ranging recommendations--you might have had reason to worry that Obama wasn't serious about committing himself to gun control. But not so fast. Obama might have sensed your pessimism, and he is very aware of the dreary history of Washington commissions. Indeed, he spoke directly to that point. ""This is not some Washington commission,"" he said. ""This is not something where folks are going to be studying the issue for six months and publishing a report that gets read and then pushed aside."" Instead, he called for quick action and then more action, backed up by the power of his office. Still, who wouldn't be doubtful? After all, Obama has done that before. Why won't he wimp out or drift away in frustration as he did with his promise to close Guantanamo Bay or push for comprehensive immigration reform? Of course, he might. But in the five days between the shooting and Wednesday's news conference, the president has raised the moral bar for himself. If he waffles now, he will forever stain his second term with an embarrassing show of public weakness and defeat. If a presidency has one tool that has not corroded, it is the power to set the agenda. To keep gun control from slipping away into the commission fog, Obama put forward a set of clear benchmarks. Usually he might say he doesn't want to ""pre-judge"" a group's work. Today he said he expected Congress to vote on at least three pieces of legislation: the assault-weapons ban, a ban on high-capacity ammunition clips, and background checks on all gun purchases. Public opinion supports all of these measures, and the president made clear he intends to use his office to fight for their passage. The National Rifle Association opposes all three of the measures. In the ongoing ""fiscal cliff"" negotiations, the president has leverage over Republicans, but he's still finding it difficult to wield. The NRA is a much more effective organization than the GOP. We're about to learn whether the Newtown massacre (along with all the others before it) has changed the dynamic for the NRA. Obama is squaring off against them in a policy struggle that traces back to the core of his presidential mission. He ran for office in 2008 promising to defeat the entrenched interests that had learned to work the system at the expense of the greater good. Now he has put himself to this task again, staring down what is perhaps the most entrenched interest. The president also promised to address the cluster of issues raised by the shooting in his State of the Union address next month. The speech is usually a laundry list of items, but it's hard to imagine that a brief mention will suffice now that he's talked about this issue in such strong moral terms. In retrospect, he also no doubt feels the sting of not mentioning gun control in his 2011 State of the Union just weeks after the attempted assassination of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. The president is also putting at stake his own theory of governing. It has always irritated him that the public and the press demand immediate action on complicated issues. It makes bad policy, and it forces him to act in phony ways, mostly by putting posturing ahead of things he thinks are more important. That was the thinking behind his initial response on the day of the shooting: Focus on the families, and talk about action later. Now he is fulfilling that promise to act, and again he is doing it at a pace he thinks wisest. The approach may not work, but if Obama were to ultimately do nothing or only offer half-hearted measures, he would prove that the Washington skeptics are right. ""The idea that we would say: 'This is terrible. This is a tragedy. Never again,' and we don't have the sustained attention span to be able to get this done over the next several months doesn't make sense,"" said Obama on Wednesday. ""I have more confidence in the American people than that."" He has put a lot of moral weight on this project. Friday, after the massacre, Obama rightly put the human woe at the forefront of his remarks. Now, with today's remarks, he has twice used the emotional human toll in the service of future action. He's saying he'll act in the name of the Newtown victims and families, calling on politicians to show the courage of Sandy Hook's principal and teachers. To call on those ghosts and then shrink from the fight would dishonor those memories he has purposefully conjured. Washington is stuck in the mirthless fiscal-cliff grind because lawmakers assigned themselves tough penalties to spur them to action. The thinking was that by making the spending cuts and tax increases so onerous lawmakers would be forced to find a solution.  It hasn't really worked because individual politicians can find ways to wriggle out of the political consequences. In his news conference, President Obama set himself up for a similar long-term penalty: ""I will use all the powers of this office to help advance efforts aimed at preventing more tragedies like this."" That's a bold promise, and it can be checked. Will he use executive orders, public cajoling, new legislation, and his vast campaign organization to advance the cause of gun control and level the playing field against the NRA? Obama has tools. If he doesn't use them, he told everyone today that there is only one person to blame."	Can Obama Win Against the NRA?	['Obama']	[]
17	17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/12/fiscal_cliff_negotiations_if_barack_obama_and_john_boehner_want_to_make.html	"""This is not Spielberg's Lincoln, OK? You're not going to pick these guys off one at a time,"" Republican Rep. Tom Cole said to me in a recent conversation about fiscal-cliff negotiations between President Obama and Republicans. ""We have one negotiator. His name is John Boehner."" President Lincoln passed the 13th Amendment by siphoning off enough Democrats to win passage. Cole says Obama can't do the same thing with today's House Republicans. Any deal that passes the House will do so with the majority of Republican support. ""If he comes back and tells us, 'This is a deal, I think it's the best deal I can get, it's an acceptable deal for the American people,'--the support will be there."" We may be close to that moment. In the last several days, the speaker and the president have been trading proposals at a faster and more serious rate. There could be a tentative deal announced this week. Cole got me to thinking: Would there be anything in such a deal to warrant treatment by Steven Spielberg? The agreement is shaping up to cover about $2 trillion in deficit cuts, which isn't puny. The White House will claim the president has notched more than $4 trillion in deficit reduction over the last year. Relative to the recent paltry history of bipartisan dealmaking, this is notable, but that may say more about the shriveled times we live in. To make it worthy of Spielberg, it would probably require introducing some space aliens or dinosaurs. Still, history is playing a part in this process. The specific wrangling is about the size of the tax increases, entitlement cuts, and the debt limit. How big a tax hike will Republicans have to accept? What level of entitlement cuts will the president ask Democrats to stomach? Will Republicans give up the leverage they gain through refusing to raise the debt limit without spending reductions? All of these details are still being worked out, but beyond getting the numbers right on paper, both men have historical reasons to get them to add up to a deal. For the president, a deal will be quick, tangible proof of the power that he gained with his re-election. It doesn't get much better for a Democratic president than bending Republicans to your position on taxes. In the last big negotiating fracas, the president told House Majority Leader Eric Cantor that he would take the fight over taxes to the American people. He did, and since Boehner has agreed to higher tax rates, it looks like the president is likely to win. More broadly though, a deal will start President Obama's second term on a good note. This round of fiscal-cliff fuss is the fifth stage of brinksmanship budgeting we've lived through since Obama took office. That hairball threatened to hang around into the second term. With a deal in hand, he will have a chance to focus on other issues. If the financial markets like whatever deal is struck, there's a chance the recovery will pick up, too. The president and his advisers believe that failure to get a deal will hurt business and consumer confidence, stifling an economy that is poised to recover. If the economy does start humming after a deal, that will be an important legacy item for Obama. The president (and his fellow Democrats) will be able to claim authorship of the recovery that pulled the country out of the greatest downturn since the Great Depression. John Boehner has a tougher route to history. In his office hangs a painting of Nicholas Longworth, the speaker of the House from 1925 to 1931 just before the New Deal. Longworth, who became known as a bipartisan dealmaker, was so admired they named one of the House office buildings after him. (Before Newt Gingrich, Longworth was the only Republican speaker to serve consecutive terms in the intervening 66 years.*)  Boehner hails from the same part of Ohio and aspires to be remembered as the working-class analog to the patrician Longworth. If there's a deal with the president, it won't get his name on a building, but it will elevate Boehner in the history books. At a time of intense sclerosis in Washington, he was able to work with a president many in his party despise to achieve something real. Of course, Boehner has got to pass a deal first. That's what Rep. Cole was talking about. The White House is worried that even if Boehner shakes hands with the president, he won't be able to get Republicans to vote for the final deal. They just won't tolerate the tax hike. Indeed, when the House Republican conference meets in HC-5, that's where Spielberg might want to station his cameras. Boehner will be trying to convince the members brought to power by anti-tax Tea Party activists to vote to raise taxes. The party whose aversion to taxes was so iron-clad that none of its presidential contenders this last cycle said they would vote for a budget deal that included $1 raised from tax revenue for every $10 raised through spending cuts. The ratio of tax revenue to spending revenue in this deal is likely to be 1-to-1. Voting for that will be dramatic and historical. It will be the first time Republicans have voted for a tax increase since 1991. There will be cries that Boehner has caved and sold out. George Bush's budget agreement of 1991, which broke his pledge against raising taxes, is still considered a great sin of the modern Republican Party. Disgust for that capitulation has guided Republican thinking for the last 20 years. The benefit most members got from fighting against a tax hike outweighed the benefit Bush got from supporting a bipartisan deal. Ron Brownstein argues in the National Journal that this rigid anti-tax stance has contributed to Republicans losing the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections. Will John Boehner usher in a new era--a return to the bargaining and dealmaking of Bush and Longworth? Or will there be no deal at all, leading to a New Year where Washington politicians are stuck in the same grind and history is forced to wait? One thing is certain: Spielberg doesn't do stalemates. Correction, Dec. 18, 2012: This article originally stated that before Newt Gingrich, Longworth was the only speaker to serve consecutive terms in the intervening 66 years. In fact, he was the only Republican speaker to serve consecutive terms during that period. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"	Could a Deal Between Obama and Boehner Be Worthy of Spielberg?

You might be wrong. At least once a year, and several times in bad years, reporters reach out to the NRA's Andrew Arulanandam and ask him whether the gun lobby has anything to say about the latest massacre. Arulanandam says basically the same thing, every time. After the April 16, 2007, Virginia Tech shootings that killed 32 people: ""The NRA joins the entire country in expressing our deepest condolences to the families of Virginia Tech University and everyone else affected by this horrible tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families."" After the Feb. 14, 2008, shootings at Northern Illinois University that killed six: ""We think it is poor form for a politician or a special interest group to try to push a legislative agenda on the back of any tragedy. Now is the time for the Northern Illinois University community to grieve and to heal. We believe there is adequate time down the road to debate policy and politics."" After the April 3, 2009, massacre at a Binghamton, N.Y., immigration center that killed 13: ""Now is not the time to debate politics or discuss policy. It's time for the families and communities to grieve."" After the Jan. 8, 2011, shooting spree that wounded Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and killed six: ""At this time, anything other than prayers for the victims and their families would be inappropriate."" After the July 20, 2012, massacre at an Aurora, Colo., theater that left 12 dead and 58 wounded: ""We believe that now is the time for families to grieve and for the community to heal. There will be an appropriate time down the road to engage in political and policy discussions."" The ""appropriate time"" never arrives. It's an ingenious communications strategy, one that removes the NRA from stories about the latest national outrages. When the outrage fades, the NRA returns in full flush. Just a week before the Newtown, Conn., shootings, Arulanandam told a reporter that the NRA was ""planning for the worst"" and had ""told people to plan for gun bans and a Supreme Court stacked with anti-gun judges."" This was more honest. The gun lobby hasn't faced a serious legislative defeat since the 1994 passage of the Assault Weapons Ban. At the time, 62 percent of Americans were telling the Gallup Poll that they wanted stricter laws on firearm sales, and 57 percent favored the semi-automatic gun ban. In 2011, support for both of those concepts had fallen to 43 percent. (According to a new Washington Post poll, support for these proposals has grown, but they still haven't reach 1990s levels.) The NRA hasn't lost any kind of vote on gun legislation since 1999, in the months after Columbine, when a background check bill got 50 votes in the Senate. The five Republicans who voted ""aye"" are all gone, and Al Gore's tiebreaking ""aye"" became a focus of the NRA's campaign against him. The gun lobby took two lessons from that vote. One: They couldn't lose unless a mass killing started a backlash and months-long discussion of new gun laws. Two: Gun owners fear those backlashes and respond to them by buying more guns and demanding to be permitted to carry them in more places. Those insights have resulted in more than a decade of untrammeled gun lobby influence, based on some misconceptions and fueled by all-American paranoia. The moment that gun enthusiasts become aware of a massacre, they make the leap: This is the way our firearms will be ripped from our warm, live hands. On Friday, it took only a few minutes for participants on the Indiana Gun Owners forums to speculate about a coming ban. ""Wasn't something like this the last straw in England that caused a near total ban of firearms?"" asked a poster named Mosinguy. ""Twitter is blowing up with people bashing the NRA,"" wrote Lammchop93. ""#GunControlNow is also trending. This just makes me sick that people are blaming the guns."" ""Hold on tight brothers and sisters to your guns and your gods,"" wrote hardwarhox. ""We will need them to make it thru the year."" Some gun owners skipped the sentiment and headed to the store. The pattern repeats after every massacre and after every election of a Democratic president--sales of firearms and ammunition surge before the liberals can supposedly engineer their inevitable bans. Anyone who's been to a gun show since 2008 has seen the rising prices and the religious certitude that President Obama will make a run at the Second Amendment, just like Illinois state Sen. Obama did in the 1990s. The irony of the Great Ammo Panic: Liberals have failed to restrict sales, even as the interstate and online purchase of ammo has become easier. One of the NRA's greatest legislative successes, the Firearms Owners' Protection Act, let dealers sell ammo without recording vital information about the buyers. That law eventually facilitated the online ammo market, which allows sites like CheaperThanDirt to sell 30-round extended clips for $8.99. That's a huge market, one that might come under threat if momentum for new gun-control laws builds. That's one reason why paranoia about massacres, and their possible legislative responses, has grown with every attack. Shortly after the Newtown story broke, the radio talker and Internet news pioneer Alex Jones warned listeners that it might have been a false flag attack to build anti-gun sentiment. ""They could use a drill to bring in a patsy,"" he said in a video that was linked to quickly by the Drudge Report. It would have come off as pure fringe talk, but the NRA itself has started to endorse theories that would-be gun-grabbers are creating crises to bring the public around. That was an argument made by NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre again and again in 2011, as Congress investigated the botched ""Fast and Furious"" scheme that gave illegal guns to Mexican cartels on the hope that the cartels could be tracked. Had the scheme worked, according to LaPierre, ""the attorney general and the secretary of state would all be running around going '90 percent of the guns come from America' in an attempt to seek political advantage and in an attempt to enact more gun-control laws on honest American citizens and use this whole issue politically against the Second Amendment of the United States."" LaPierre's riff was derided by every liberal with a keyboard. It probably seemed necessary. There's no easy way for the gun lobby to pre-empt the post-massacre backlash. In slow months, when the massacres have fallen out of the news, they typically roll out a spokesman--LaPierre in particular--to put the onus on the government gun-grabbers. At the 2011 Conservative Political Action conference, about a month after the Giffords shooting, LaPierre shifted the blame for gun crimes onto liberals who ""exploited"" them: At Virginia Tech, at Northern Illinois University, at Fort Hood, at a high school, and at a grade school--these were the victims of five deranged killers. And those five mass killers all had the same decisive advantage: ""Gun Free Zones"" and anti-self-defense laws that protected the safety of no one except the killers and condemned the victims to death without so much as a prayer. Let me say that again. Our own policies gave more protection to the killers than to the innocent. That was the time to talk about politics."

President Obama: Twenty-seven people are dead, 20 of them children, and you just told the nation that we're all going to have to ""extend a hand to those in need.""* ""We've endured too many of these tragedies,"" you rightly noted, clearly moved by the particular horrendousness of what took place in Connecticut today. And then, holding back your tears, you said this: I react to news like this, ""not as a president, but as a parent."" God, that is unbelievably wrong. React as a president. Earlier today, your press secretary, Jay Carney, speaking for you, said that today is not the day to talk about gun control. ""There is, I am sure, will be, rather, a day for discussion of the usual Washington policy debates, but I do not think today is that day."" Right, right, today's not the day because we wouldn't want to politicize a tragedy. That might make you look crass. And more important than stopping future elementary school students from being shot in the face and head and chest and little legs is for you to show a little tact by rising above your unseemly urge to make this country better. Also, you don't want to offend anyone directly involved in the shooting. Like the parents of the kids who were murdered this morning while learning basic addition and how to write their ABCs. I'm sure they just want you to stay out of it for the day--keep it to yourself, will ya? Because no one likes a president who would immediately and decisively stand up to stop something like this from happening again. That's just too political, and you are a statesman. Plus, the benefit of not ""capitalizing"" on the tragedy is that, in a few days, most of us will put this whole thing behind us. We have Christmas presents to buy and trees to decorate--this is a very busy time of year! So if you wait this one out, just kind of do the bare minimum of your job, our outrage will probably pass, and you can avoid any of those ""usual Washington policy debates."" Those are such a yawn, amirite? History is on your side. Just this week there was a shooting in a Portland, Ore., mall--did you hear about it? It's receded in my mind, too. Remember Aurora? Yes, the one with Batman in it! You were running for your second term when that horrific mass shooting happened, so it was definitely not the time to do anything constructive. And then there was another one in Wisconsin--details are hazy in my mind because after a while these rampages all run together. Carney had you covered then, too: The White House on Monday all but ruled out the possibility that President Barack Obama would make a push for new gun control laws in the aftermath of the shooting rampage in Oak Creek, Wis. Press secretary Jay Carney noted that Obama had called for better enforcement of existing laws in the wake of the massacre at an Aurora, Colo., movie theater last month. ""I have nothing new to announce,"" Carney said at his daily briefing. In fact, you ended up winning the election with barely a mention of gun control and got to trot out Gabrielle Giffords in a moving moment at your Democratic convention, so that worked out. I don't know what you plan to do after your presidency, but unless you are hoping to replace Wayne LaPierre, you are probably safe to go out on a limb here today. Bill Clinton was a lame-duck president at the time of Columbine, but he pushed for tougher regulations and politicized the hell out of that school shooting.  Still, that guy was never known for his political skill, so I see your point. Anyway, I know you have a very busy schedule and are really looking forward to kicking back for the weekend and hugging your kids a little tighter before bed tonight. TGIF. But could you just let us all know: When would be a better day? Update, 3:54 p.m.: This article has been updated to reflect the most recent death toll. (Return to top.)"

20	20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/12/bobby_jindal_marco_rubio_paul_ryan_and_chris_christie_are_among_the_rising.html	"Mitt Romney has gone from being the face of the Republican Party to being just another face in the crowd--at the gas station, at the pizza joint, and ringside at a boxing match. The party is looking for somebody new, and the tryouts are already well under way. The Republican National Committee announced this week that it has put together a committee to investigate the lessons of 2012 and help chart a new course for the future. GOP stars like Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Rep. Paul Ryan, and Sen. Marco Rubio appear to have already reached their own conclusions. As they and others come forward, we can see the rough outlines of a classification scheme of potential GOP party leaders begin to emerge. So far, we have the truth teller, the compassionate conservative, the coalition whisperer, and the doer. Jindal was in Washington playing the role of the truth teller on Tuesday, and he hoped he would get noticed. ""Maybe I should say some things that are not allowed to be said in public. Maybe I should say some things that folks think about but are afraid to say in polite company,"" he told a Brookings Institution audience. ""It is completely dishonest to pretend today that America provides equal opportunity in education. We do not. And if you say that we do, you are lying."" Not too many people think there is equal opportunity in education--so ""truth teller"" is a more apt label--but by trying to be provocative on the question of education, Jindal was emphasizing an issue usually associated with Democratic politicians. George W. Bush used the education issue to distinguish himself from other Republicans before his own bid for the White House. Not that long ago when a Republican leader charged someone with being ""completely dishonest,"" you knew he was probably talking about President Obama. Now these party luminaries are discussing a wider set of issues. Ryan focused on poverty in his first speech since the election. Rubio, in his first big post-election speech, focused on economic mobility. Individually these could be the idiosyncratic choices of three separate men, but taken together they are something far more intentional: a repudiation of Mitt Romney. These aspiring leaders are distancing themselves from the images Romney left us--the image of 47 percent of the American public addicted to government or voters choosing to vote for the president because of the ""gifts"" of government largesse he delivered. In their recent remarks, these three men are either speaking directly to the 47 percent or about ways to improve the lives of those who belong to it. This tack is both an effort to expand the party's base beyond a shrinking group of Southern white male voters, as well as a deliberate message of inclusion to improve the party's image with swing voters, particularly suburban women. It was Jindal who reacted most forcefully to Romney's remarks about ""gifts"" after the election: I think that's absolutely wrong ... we have got to stop dividing the American voters ... we need to continue to show how our policies help every voter out there achieve the American dream, which is to be in the middle class, which is to be able to give their children an opportunity to be able to get a great education. ... So, I absolutely reject that notion, that description. I think that's absolutely wrong. During the presidential campaign, it seemed that Romney was always struggling to find a way to make a mark for himself. It turns out this was wrong. Romney did make a mark--and his potential successors are running away from it fast. Last week Paul Ryan played the role of the compassionate conservative as he delivered the keynote speech at the Jack Kemp Foundation dinner. Perhaps, given the venue, Ryan should be labeled a ""bleeding-heart conservative."" That's what Kemp liked to call himself. He was the most prominent modern conservative to relentlessly champion conservative ideas as a way to help the poor. Ryan spoke at length about poverty. Though he was trying to fashion himself in the Kemp mold, as a vice-presidential candidate, he was never much like Kemp. In 1996, as Bob Dole's running mate, Kemp visited Watts and Harlem and spoke relentlessly about those on the lower end of the economic ladder. Ryan didn't show the same emphasis--nor is Ryan taking a leadership role on these issues in the current fight with Democrats over budget priorities. It might be hard to do that during the ""fiscal cliff"" negotiations, but that highlights a serious limitation for Ryan--he's a member of Congress. His perch doesn't let him do much besides deliver speeches. Marco Rubio is something more rare--the coalition whisperer. Party strategists are hoping he will be the man who helps Republicans improve their relationship with Hispanic voters. Unlike Ryan, who must operate in the balky political system, Rubio has public gifts of the kind on display at that same Kemp dinner. He told the crowd that night of being presented with a badge from the hotel's catering department that read, ""Rubio, Banquet Bartender,"" in honor of his father. ""It all starts with our people,"" Rubio continued. ""In the kitchens of our hotels. In the landscaping crews that work in our neighborhoods. In the late-night janitorial shifts that clean our offices. There you will find the dreams America was built on. There you will find the promise of tomorrow."" No other national Republican figure can speak like that. Some fortunate GOP rising stars get to play more than one role. Jindal was speaking to the crowd at the Brookings Institution on Tuesday because he is the governor of a state whose education system was being praised for its successful experiments with school choice. Besides trying to fashion himself as a truth teller, Jindal can also claim to be a ""doer"" who can point to actual accomplishments. This is also true of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who has been heralding his recent agreement with the Newark teachers union. Last week, Christie visited the White House and helped win more emergency aid for those hit by Hurricane Sandy. In the intraparty competition to shape the GOP's future, Christie and Jindal will have an advantage by virtue of being governors who can point to their achievements, whereas Ryan and Rubio are members of Congress, an institution where achievement goes to die. That is, as long as Christie and Jindal don't run from their accomplishments as governors as Mitt Romney did. That's another lesson they've undoubtedly learned."

21	21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/12/fiscal_cliff_why_the_stalled_negotiations_between_barack_obama_and_john.html	"If you are distracted by the holidays and not paying attention to every twist and turn of the fiscal cliff drama, the guidelines we set up several weeks ago still apply. Until House Republicans say they support a tax rate hike, you can ignore the noise and go about your life. However, if you happened to turn on C-SPAN today, you might have seen Speaker John Boehner talking about the fiscal cliff and wonder what's going on. Boehner said that the president has not offered enough spending cuts in negotiations. The only way Boehner is going to get House Republicans to sign on to a tax increase is if he can show his troops that the president has agreed to significant spending cuts. That sounds like stalemate. It is. It's also a sign of progress. At this point you might want to go back to wrapping presents. Fiscal cliff talks have this frustrating circularity to them. That's why the Wall Street Journal can claim there is progress on the same day The Chicago Tribune can say there is a stalemate. If you continue reading, we can't be responsible for putting you in a bad mood for your office party tonight. You can claim progress or standstill at almost any moment. We're at a standstill because Boehner won't agree to a rate increase or because the president won't agree to big enough spending cuts, but if the two sides are talking that's progress relative to not talking at all. To some degree, it's always going to look like both progress and stalemate until there is either a deal Boehner has to sell to his members or until the whole thing finally breaks down and we go over the ""cliff."" The final fiscal cliff deal will almost certainly contain an increase in tax rates and spending cuts large enough--or of a kind--to irritate the president's supporters. White House advisers say that in the 2011 debt ceiling negotiations, the administration named too may spending cuts on the theory that Republicans would then agree to tax revenue--but then the GOP cuts didn't follow. So they're going to let Republicans go first this time. GOP sources familiar with the talks say the White House hasn't been as forthcoming as they were during the last set of negotiations--Medicaid changes are one example. So Republicans are legitimately frustrated. That might make you think the needle is pointed toward stalemate. But if there is ever going to be a deal, it will only happen if Boehner looks like he has dragged the president somewhere President Obama doesn't want to go. Each time the speaker makes a public display, as he did today, it shows that he is fighting the good fight and holding the president's feet to the fire. Now, if there is a deal, he can say, ""I beat on the president about cutting spending, and he gave in."" Members are going to look closely at the math above the theatrics, but if Boehner were unable to point to moments of peril and stalemate, his rank-and-file will just assume he got rolled. Therefore, this statement that seems to be about frustration--which would suggest we're farther than ever from a deal--can actually be seen as a necessary prerequisite for a deal. The one trick for Boehner is that he can't appear to be too effective. He doesn't want to stir his members into such a fevered pitch that they don't accept any deal. Perhaps that's why Boehner described his meeting with the president this weekend as ""nice"" and ""cordial."" Everyone is still at the negotiating table fighting about taxes and spending, which means nothing has really changed in the underlying story. By the end of the day, we learned that Boehner made his CSPAN-televised remarks after receiving a White House offer (which he didn't mention on the House floor). The president had trimmed his proposal that $1.6 trillion be raised from taxes to $1.4 trillion. Boehner responded with his own counteroffer later in the day. Negotiations have stalled--which means they are making progress."	Why Stalled Negotiations on the Fiscal Cliff Are the Surest Sign of Progress	['Obama']	[]
22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/12/jim_demint_to_heritage_foundation_the_conservative_south_carolina_senator.html	"For quite some time, in quiet tones, the friends of Jim DeMint had been expecting him to leave the Senate and take over the Heritage Foundation. On Thursday morning, when DeMint said he'd be quitting the Senate four years early, the believers were gleeful. ""I'd secretly wished for it,"" said one staffer from the conservative think tank. ""I always thought he was going to head Heritage,"" said an alumnus of DeMint's Senate staff. At 11 a.m., outgoing Heritage President and CEO Ed Feulner introduced DeMint to most of the think tank's staff. They packed the Allison Auditorium, the seventh-floor venue that has a clear view of the nearby Capitol, and they gave the new guy a standing O. ""I feel like I just walked in the front door of my own house,"" said DeMint. ""Leaving the Senate to become president of the Heritage Foundation is a big promotion."" Senators don't typically talk like that until they've lost re-election. Heritage, like D.C.'s other think tanks, is peopled by ""fellows"" who lost their last elections and want to keep respectable toeholds in the city. DeMint will probably sextuple his salary by moving out of the Senate,  but he's giving up the ability to introduce bills, filibuster Democratic legislation, put holds on nominations, and humiliate presidential nominees on C-Span 2. Why did DeMint want to quit, and why did Heritage welcome him so warmly? DeMint-ism was never about legislating. It was about blocking legislation and unwinding current laws. DeMint figured out, correctly, that he could do more good playing the outside game as his acolytes in the Senate played the inside game. Heritage agreed. The Tea Party, as represented by DeMint, has taken over a tea-and-cookies conservative institution and readied it for guerrilla warfare. DeMint has never known anything else. In 1983, clutching his MBA from Clemson University, DeMint founded a marketing firm. Nine years later, he was approached by Rep. Bob Inglis to work on his campaign for the redrawn 1st congressional district, covering Greenville, Spartanburg, and most of upstate South Carolina. DeMint's first real political job was message-testing and marketing for a Republican trying to defeat a resilient incumbent Democrat who'd worked for the Peace Corps and Head Start. Inglis won, served three terms, then made way for his marketer, who'd been losing friends and clients because of his campaign work. ""I quickly learned that there is little glamour and a lot of suspicion in politics,"" wrote DeMint in his 2009 memoir/manifesto Saving Freedom. He was already 47 years old. In the House, DeMint quickly figured out two things: who had power, and what he wanted to stop them from doing with that power. He became the freshman class president (in a weak year for the party) and sidled up to the man Republicans thought would be speaker, Bob Livingston. ""I spent the evening [of the class dinner] bending Livingston's ear about freedom and the policy ideas I believed would inspire all Americans,"" wrote DeMint in 2009. ""He seemed really interested."" And then Livingston quit, done in by a sex scandal, and Republicans gave the gavel to the colorless Dennis Hastert. Slightly discouraged, DeMint took his oath of office. In his memoir, he focused on the text of the oath--references to the Constitution, but not to any sort of legislative goals. ""There is nothing in this oath about representing my district and state or helping the poor and downtrodden,"" he would remember. ""There was nothing about responding to the woes of the American people."" He became a reliable ""no"" vote, admiring the stances of Ron Paul (""he argued that just about everything Congress did was unconstitutional [and] he was usually right""). He was one of 34 Republicans to oppose No Child Left Behind and one of 25 to oppose Medicare Part D. DeMint's colleagues, like Paul Ryan, took the bullet on those George W. Bush initiatives.  They got clout. DeMint's clout remained nonexistent. It wasn't until 2004, when he moved up to the Senate, that DeMint found a way to influence the Congress without actually legislating. Bush spent most of 2005 campaigning for Social Security privatization, hoping that Congress would take one of the proposals that had been kicking around and turn it into a bill. It was a perfect DeMint cause, and he joined it, sponsoring a bill that would have created private ""GROW accounts,"" invested in government bonds, funded by surplus FICA taxes. It was a perfect DeMint cause because it was doomed. Beautifully branded--who doesn't like accounts that grow?--it needed pressure on Congress from outside, by a movement ready to fight a decades-long battle for entitlement reform. The movement did not exist. In the 2006 elections, Republican numbers in the Senate dropped from 55 to 49. In 2008, they dropped to 41. DeMint, like most conservatives, interpreted this as proof that the party needed to move right. ""Americans do prefer a traditional conservative government,"" he told South Carolina Republicans after the Obama win. ""They just did not believe Republicans were going to give it to them."" Four days later, in the Senate GOP's closed-door leadership meetings, DeMint proposed that the party limit members to only six years on the appropriations committee. In his second memoir, The Great American Awakening, DeMint admitted that he lost by a 36-5 margin and ""effectively entered a new phase of my Senate career."" ""I decided my work could no longer be with other senators,"" he wrote. ""I would have to find ways to work with the American people to elect a new class of senators."" And so he did. He met with Pat Toomey, who would run for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania and scare Arlen Specter into the Democratic Party. He met with Marco Rubio, who made him misty-eyed as he talked about his family's flight from Cuba's communism. He met with Rand Paul, who was challenging Mitch McConnell's anointed candidate for an open U.S. Senate seat in Kentucky. Suddenly, that movement he'd needed in 2005 had come into existence. Everything DeMint did was amplified by Tea Party activists--heckling Charlie Crist here, heckling Arlen Specter there--and promoted in the conservative media. DeMint would go anywhere to talk to Tea Partiers. ""They were hoping and praying for a few members of Congress to stand with them,"" he would write. ""Something deeply spiritual was happening in the nation."" Most of DeMint's 2010 candidates won. The media focused on the candidates who blew it, like Nevada's Sharron Angle, Colorado's Ken Buck, and Delaware's Christine O'Donnell. In the chatty, catty Senate, it was easy to find Republicans scapegoating DeMint for those losers. But he'd succeeded in his other races, and when the Senate met again in November 2010, his new recruits helped ban earmarking. In December, the Senate killed an omnibus spending bill that both sides had expected to pass. No single politician had so much influence in shifting his party toward his goals. And yet, for all that underdog success, DeMint mostly lost. By nudging out Specter, DeMint ensured a 60th Democratic vote for the Affordable Care Act. By defeating that omnibus bill, DeMint's colleagues kicked off an era of short-term spending bills, interrupted occasionally by legislative standoffs in which Republicans try (and fail) to find leverage for structural reforms. DeMint introduced 35 bills in this Congress, everything from a National Right to Work Act to a ban on future IMF bailouts for struggling countries. None of his bills became law. He was a marketer, a recruiter--not a legislator. He never pretended otherwise. What does any of this mean for Heritage? Since the 1970s, the think tank has churned out white papers, rapid responses, and smart staffers for Republican members of Congress. In 2010, it launched a 501(c)4 campaign arm, Heritage Action for America, which started scoring the votes of wayward Republicans and running ads on key issues. Some congressional Republicans complained--weren't there already enough groups giving them report cards and demanding they go the right way on ""message"" votes? DeMint hasn't been hired to change that. He's been hired to make it work, to get more Republicans singing from the hymnal. He'll fit right in. The current head of Heritage Action got there after spending 2007 and 2008 on the Hill, working with a Republican senator who wanted to keep the party pure. The senator's name was Jim DeMint."

That was sort of the point of Tim Huelskamp. In 2009, when a safe Republican seat in western Kansas opened up, State Sen. Huelskamp established himself as the mad-as-hell candidate. He told conservative bloggers of his fight to defund Planned Parenthood, ban gay marriage, and keep Kathleen Sebelius out of the Obama cabinet. In one TV ad, as the mellow-looking Huelskamp climbed into a tractor, voters were told that he ""went against his party leaders, and was kicked off his committee, for bucking the establishment and fighting wasteful spending."" He won easy. History repeats. On Tuesday, the re-elected Huelskamp walked into a luncheon at the Heritage Foundation and told conservative activists how he'd just been booted from the Budget and Agriculture Committees. It was a ""purge,"" and his crime was being exactly as conservative as he'd promised. ""We've heard from multiple sources that someone walked in with a list of votes and said, 'if you didn't [fulfill] a particular scorecard on the 'right' votes--which by the way, in most cases, were not the conservative positions--we're gonna remove you from committee."" The activists quietly chewed Chick-fil-A sandwiches as Huelskamp scorched his party leaders. ""It confirms, in my mind, Americans' deepest suspicions about Washington. It's petty, it's vindictive, and if you have any conservative principles, you will be punished for it."" If losing the 2012 election was tough for movement conservatives, the month since the loss has been even tougher. They're losing every internal power struggle that matters. On Nov. 14, conservative Rep. Tom Price lost a secret ballot election for a leadership post. The next day, the conservative Republican Study Committee gave its chairmanship to Rep. Steve Scalise, who'd been opposed by the group's former leaders--like Tom Price. Over the next two weeks, Washington bubbled with rumors of Republicans agreeing to raise taxes, and violate the pledge they'd made to Grover Norquist, if it got them a ""grand bargain"" that cut spending on entitlements. Huelskamp responded with a YouTube video in which he warned that ""a lot of my colleagues appear ready to break their word,"" but when he signed that pledge, he ""meant it."" On Dec. 3, Republican leaders sent an open letter to President Obama admitting that their ideal plan couldn't pass, but some combination of entitlement cuts and ""revenue"" enhancement could. Conservatives like Huelskamp attacked, joined by David Koch's Tea Party group Americans for Prosperity and the Heritage Foundation. This was when Huelskamp learned he'd lost the plum committee assignment. Joining him in exile were Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, who'd also been bounced from Budget, and Arizona Rep. David Schweikert, who'd lost a place on Financial Services. Huelskamp and Amash had both voted against Paul Ryan's 2013 budget when it got into the committee, on the grounds that it didn't balance fast enough. Amash arrived at Tuesday's Heritage luncheon a little after Huelskamp. He called the leadership's move an outright ""purge,"" and a disrespectful one. ""I've not a single call from anyone in leadership, not a single email,"" he said. ""I've read about this in the media."" Huelskamp placed his hand on Amash's shoulder. ""The call is coming,"" he said. Conservative activists interpret the Amash/Huelskamp/Schweikert purge as a rearguard action against the party base. There's reason to believe them. The 2011 debt limit standoff cratered public opinion of the GOP, and when it didn't recover, leaders started to criticize the new outside groups that had subjected Republicans to litmus tests, threatening them if they cast wayward votes. On Tuesday, Amash said he voted against the 2013 Ryan budget--after ""voting with our team 95 percent of the time""--because ""we did not take a strong enough stance in dealing with our debt."" That was exactly the argument made by Heritage Action, the campaign branch of the conservative think tank, which had launched in the Tea Party year of 2010. Republican leaders can't punish Heritage, but it can punish back-benchers. ""The last 24 hours are very concerning to those of us in the conservative movement who are hoping to see Republicans stand for conservative principles,"" said Tim Chapman, COO of Heritage Action.* ""We still believe principled policy is good politics. The American people are looking for leadership."" According to Chapman, and to House conservatives, the election bolstered their argument. The GOP's majority only shrunk by eight seats, and the vast majority of conservatives survived. The highest-profile Republican loser was probably Rep. Allen West, who's appeared in the lede of every ""Tea Party R.I.P."" story. But after he lost, the moderate-hunting Club for Growth noted that West voted their way only 64 percent of the time. ""Allen West is a classic example of how the main-stream media lumps together everyone who won in 2010 into a giant 'tea-party' blob based only on rhetoric,"" said Club spokesman Barney Keller, ""not their actual commitment to promoting economic freedom and limited government."" Conservatism didn't fail. People failed--the sort of scaredy-cats who passed that watered-down budget. ""What did we get for a House majority in 2010?"" asked Huelskamp. ""All I can see is a smaller majority in 2012. The response of a failed institution, when you fail, is to turn and start punishing people internally."" It was a sell-out, just as in 1995, when Republicans were ""days away"" from winning the battle over the government shutdown, then caved. According to Amash, the party leaders were blaming the wrong people. They, not libertarian-leaning Republicans like him, were the ones who spent ""$300 million on ads that didn't work."" They'd ruined the brand. ""The polling bears this out,"" said Huelskamp. ""The best electoral advantage Republicans have is that Americans don't think we're the party that will raise your taxes. If taxes go up, Obama doesn't lose. The Democrats don't lose. We lose!"" Huelskamp has been here before, of course. He told those Kansas voters that he had a way of getting kicked off of committees. Amash has been cruising toward a conflict like this for a long time. An avowed admirer of Rep. Ron Paul, whose endorsement helped Amash get to Congress, he'd established a pretty sizable network of libertarian supporters. They were waking up, telling him to be proud at what his stance had forced the leadership to do. Before he left the think tank, I asked Amash about the leadership's thinking. What explained those polls that showed most Americans blaming the GOP for a potential cliff-fall? ""The polling is bad because the messaging is bad,"" he said. ""Republicans are pitting this as entitlements versus 'tax cuts for the rich.' "" All that said, if the Republican leadership was visibly distancing itself from libertarians and Tea Partiers, what would that mean for their leverage? ""I think it makes their leverage worse,"" said Amash. ""I was one of the people on the Budget Committee trusted by Democrats, because I was a fair broker. I've been willing to stand up for Democrats when they've called for reductions in military spending. If anything, what they've created is a more uniform Republican party. There's only one message going out, and it's the message of the speaker and the leadership."" Correction, Dec. 10, 2012: This piece incorrectly described Tim Chapman as CEO if Heritage Action.

24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/filibuster_reform_and_harry_reid_four_reasons_a_democratic_plan_to_change.html	"Nobody spits out the word efficiency quite like Mitch McConnell. Every morning this week, the Republican leader has stood behind his desk in the Senate and warned of Democratic tyranny. He's pronounced the ""e"" word with contempt so thick it practically fogs his glasses. ""In the name of efficiency,"" he said on Monday, ""their plan is to use a heavy-handed tactic that would poison party relations even more. In the name of efficiency, they would prevent the very possibility of compromise, and threaten to make the disputes of the past few years look like pillow fights."" The next day, he characterized Harry Reid's position as: ""We have to make the Senate more efficient, and we have to violate the Senate's rules to do so, so that he and his colleagues in the majority can implement more easily their vision for America."" The ""heavy-handed"" tactic in question is filibuster reform. In 2013, on their third attempt in eight years, senators might actually tweak the filibuster. To understand why Democrats might actually pull this off, you have to understand what ""this"" is. Democratic aides describe a small number of connected changes, which could be voted through on Jan. 3, the day the new Senate convenes. Only 51 votes are needed to set Senate rules at the start of the year. After that, it would take 67 votes. Democrats will have 53 seats, and two independents who've announced they'll caucus with them. Currently, the motion to go to conference--to take a bill to the House-Senate committee that can pass it--can be objected. The objection delays the process by a week. Democrats want to end that. The modern filibuster is typically a threat to deny cloture--60 votes--to move ahead on a bill. Some Democrats want to make the senator denying a vote ""park his fanny on the floor"" (Dick Durbin's words) and talk--actually filibuster the filibuster. The Republican minority doesn't know, or cannot say, how it might block these reforms. So far, it's been pointing out that the Senate is supposed to be a legislation-shredding slog, and well, heck, Democrats used to defend the filibuster, so what's their problem? But there at least four reasons why this particular set of reforms might work. 1. These aren't particularly new or scary ideas. Americans, raised on Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, would hardly be horrified by a filibuster that actually forced a senator to speak. (Two years ago, after their party had lost the House and six Senate seats, New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall and Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, both Democrats, called for a ""real filibuster"" that would make senators show up and talk.) Nor does it seem ridiculous to ban filibusters on procedural votes. 2. Majority Leader Harry Reid wants reform. He didn't always. In 2005, as Republicans constantly (and fairly!) remind him, Reid opposed a potential Republican-backed rule change that would have ended the filibuster for judicial nominations. The filibuster, he said, was ""a tool that serves the long-term interest of the Senate and the American people and our country."" Cameras were recording that. He helped sandbag Udall and Merkley's 2010-11 reform campaign. Only in May 2012 did he apologize, saying that ""these two young, fine senators said it was time we changed the rules in the Senate, and we didn't. They were right. The rest of us were wrong."" Reid makes reform possible, and keeps the reformers from getting too aggressive. 3. Everybody's a hypocrite. McConnell likes to quote Reid's 2005 filibuster epistles. Democrats like to quote McConnell's. The Republican leader casts everything he can as an appeal to Constitution and tradition, and in 2005 he pointed out that a change to nomination standard would ""not be the first time a minority of senators has upset a Senate tradition or practice."" Democrats hyperventilated then, and Republicans hyperventilate now. They even use the same language. The ""nuclear option"" is a term that makes a 51-vote rule change sound terrifying. Trent Lott coined the term, Democrats picked it up, and Republicans have resurrected it. Only 45 members of the new Senate were around in 2005. The grand Democratic defenders of the filibuster tradition, like Robert Byrd, are gone. (McConnell's Tuesday speech praising the Byrd legacy got little attention.) The new members are not so bound to rules invented by previous Senates. ""I don't see the current rules as ... the inevitable product of constitutional command,"" said Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican who clerked for Sam Alito before getting to the Senate in 2011. ""Nor do I see as incompatible with constitutional demand the rule to govern how debate is brought to a close. There is nothing more directly placed at the discretion of the Senate."" (Though Lee opposes a rule change.) 4. Republicans haven't figured out a good defense. McConnell's daily speeches have shared a repeatable, bite-sized theme: Democrats want to ""break the rules to change the rules."" In their own speeches and comments to reporters, Republicans such as South Dakota's John Thune, Wyoming's John Barrasso, Alabama's Jeff Sessions are using the same phrase. Like McConnell, they sometimes warn that a post-reform Senate would become ungovernable. ""You know, so much of what we do is courteous around here,"" Sessions told me between votes. ""So much of what's done is done by unanimous consent. You don't have to give consent. If you feel like you've been run over, that the Senate is being endangered, a good senator has every right, or duty, even, to use what tools they may have to stop and even reverse that decision."" Democrats can barely stop themselves from laughing at this. How could the Senate possibly work more slowly than it works now? Why would people blame them for more logjams when they've effectively cast Republicans as the hell-no party? That Democratic confidence, and that Republican agita, is stopping most Republicans from ruling out the possibility of a deal that prevents a 51-vote rule change while tweaking some elements of the filibuster. Republicans want to reform the process of adding poison-pill amendments to a bill so that the minority can't do it. Sessions mentioned this, while saying that Republicans would ""support Mitch McConnell."" Hearing that, you can imagine McConnell dragging this out and agreeing to a compromise that reforms the filibuster in the most minor ways. Anything would be better than outright defeat--and better than efficiency."	Four Reasons the Democratic Plan To Reform the Senate Filibuster Might Actually Succeed	['Reid', 'Udall', 'McConnell']	[]

""Don't call my bluff,"" he said, according to Cantor. ""I'm going to the American people with this."" During this season's budget fight, the president is not waiting for talks to break down. He's hitting the road early. On Friday, he will highlight the damage that will be done to the middle class if the country sails over the fiscal cliff on a visit to a manufacturing operation in Hatfield, Penn. (If the Republicans were feeling fun, they'd schedule an event in McCoy.) The president's aides say he is working inside the negotiating room and outside of it, and that a president must do both. But according to one who has discussed Obama's second term with him, the president believes he spent too much time in his first term engaged with members of Congress--even members of his own party. In the second term he's going to use his office to generate outside support that puts pressure on Republicans. In this case that means one thing: agreeing to raise tax rates on the wealthy. In the president's view, that's either going to happen through agreement in the room, or after the Jan. 1 deadline has passed and public pressure forces Republicans to cave. Will the outside game work? It didn't when Obama had that confrontation with Cantor. During the 2011 debt-limit fight, the president's approval ratings dropped to their lowest levels, as he was bogged down in a battle opaque to most people. But a lot has changed since then. Most obviously, Obama has been re-elected. If a deal is not struck, the president will not suffer at the ballot box. Obama's re-election also indicates a mandate of this specific question of tax rates for the wealthy. Exit polls show 60 percent of voters support the hike. Polls also show that people are primed to blame Republicans if no deal is struck. Forty-five percent surveyed in a new CNN/ORC poll said they would blame congressional Republicans if there is no agreement. Only 34 percent said they would blame President Obama. There is a theory--argued most effectively by Brandice Canes-Wrone, in Who Leads Whom? --that presidents cannot lead the country so much as shape public opinion. Presidents are effective only when the public is already with them. Last summer the fight was unfocused. Now the lines are clearer. Though the fiscal cliff debate touches all areas of government, the immediate debate is essentially focused on raising or lowering taxes on the wealthy. This president has won battles with Congress when the topic is narrow, as he did over the extension of the payroll tax cut and holding down student loan interest rates. Republicans don't like the president taking his case to the public. ""We already know the president is a very good campaigner,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. ""What we don't know is whether he has the leadership qualities necessary to lead his party to a bipartisan agreement on a big issue likes this."" On the House side, one aide to Republican leadership said Republican members are concerned the president's public campaigning is an attempt to prepare public opinion for an eventual failure to reach a deal, and thus a possible sign that he's not really serious about a deal. For the moment, those working on a deal from the House GOP side say the White House is negotiating in good faith (though not with the level of specificity they'd like). If they start to see the White House ""slow walk"" negotiations, they'll know that Obama has decided that going over the ""cliff"" is not that big a deal and the campaign-style trip is an effort to build leverage for the post-Jan. 1, 2013 period. White House aides insist the president wants to get a deal. He thinks the post-Jan. 1 shock to the economy would be real and that the recovery is too fragile. ""Just because everyone in Washington thinks this can be worked out in three weeks if we go over the cliff, no one in the business world or families would think that way,"" says a White House official. Republicans are looking for any number of ways to take the microphone back from the president. Grover Norquist proposes that Republicans push to have the fiscal cliff negotiations televised. ""The only way for Republicans to have a chance is to have American people in there, not allow establishment press to explain to you what happened. The president has a better megaphone. Unless you focus on what's happening in the room, the press focuses on those who bend toward the TV cameras, but who aren't in the room."" If Obama is trying to take his message to the people, Norquist is trying to take the people to the negotiations. Norquist also wants to have whatever deal is struck posted online for seven days before a vote so that people can have a look at it. If these gambits sound familiar, it's because young and innocent Barack Obama of the 2008 campaign vowed to have negotiations on television and post bills online for five days. The White House is not likely to go along with either of these ideas and John Boehner might not want to either. As a skilled legislator, Boehner knows that the final deal might include lots of fudging and weasel words that can get votes but that won't be so easy to explain once Twitter, bloggers, and talk radio get to whack at them for a week. Sometimes, when you take an issue to the public you want it to be a done deal."	Will the President's Fiscal-Cliff Road Trip Rally the Public To Support Tax Hikes for the Rich?	['McConnell', 'Obama']	[]
26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/fiscal_cliff_would_house_republicans_actually_vote_for_a_deal_that_would.html	"President Obama is adamant that he will only agree to a ""fiscal cliff"" solution that raises tax rates on those making over $250,000. The Republicans in the majority in the House of Representatives are adamant that they will not vote for those tax increases--Speaker John Boehner chief among them. I asked a senior House leadership aide the what chances were that Boehner would be able to get a majority of Republicans to vote for a tax increase of any kind: ""pretty close to zero."" If you get busy mailing your holiday cards, this issue of tax rates is the only one you need to check in on from time to time to earn your citizenship merit badge. Did Republicans in the House of Representatives agree to increase marginal tax rates? That would be news indeed. Just two years ago, the anti-tax Tea Party reinvigorated the GOP, but now its members would be voting for a tax hike. Or, if you hear the president has backed off his demand that taxes must be increased, that would be worth a Facebook posting, too. This was an election that President Obama says gave him a mandate to raise this specific tax: How could he give up so easily? Of course, if there's no movement on either side, you can return to your more fruitful personal pursuits free from worry that a resolution is aborning. Using this three-part filter, we can examine recent news that Republican Sens. Saxby Chambliss and Lindsey Graham have expressed support for raising revenue through the tax code as a part of a deal that would avoid the automatic spending cuts and tax increases that will come on Jan. 1. Our model tells us that the first relevant fact is that they are senators. In this drama, being a senator is not very important. Democrats control the Senate, and the majority will go along with the president. The real action of the day is between Barack Obama and John Boehner. Is there a majority of votes for a tax increase in the House of Representatives? Senators can comment on that; they can send helpful memos; they can hand out mixed nuts during negotiations; but they are in the chorus, not on stage. A few select GOP senators --Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, conservative leader Jim DeMint--might influence House Republicans, but those men are also likely to be on the same page as House Speaker John Boehner. The second problem our model points out for us is that Graham and Chambliss are not talking about tax rates. They're talking about revenue increases, which is quite a different thing. They'd consider closing loopholes and limiting deductions, which would increase the share of taxes paid by the wealthy but would not raise their marginal tax rates. This puts them a bit to the left of anti-tax advocate Grover Norquist but still much farther to the right than Barack Obama, who wants marginal rates to increase at the end of the year for those making over $250,000 as they are scheduled to. Sen. John McCain, who has also indicated he is open to revenue increases through the tax code, has also said he would not support a tax increase. Sen. Bob Corker is in this camp, too, but he wants to cut tax rates. Still, isn't it a good sign for the president and an ultimate deal that Norquist is angry with Graham and Chambliss? Maybe, but not necessarily. Chambliss and Graham have clashed with Norquist before without corralling a host of followers in the GOP ranks. So it may not be sign of a larger movement. Plus, if a Republican says he is open to using the tax code to bring in revenue, they may very well hope that doing so helps them duck the accusation that they are ideologically immovable on taxes. Removed of that particular pressure, they can feel more free to ignore the president's entreaties to embrace the more politically painful increase in tax rates. Norquist wants any loophole closures offset with a reduction in marginal rates. That's also John Boehner's position. If you're interested in the GOP vs. Grover Norquist Civil War, this is where the action is on the House side: Will a Republican member sign up for revenue increases that are not paired with a reduction in marginal tax rates? That too would put them at war with Norquist, but it still wouldn't put that Republican in the president's camp. It's a sign of how far apart the president and House Republicans are that the mark of GOP apostasy is closing loopholes without cutting taxes. Obama wants Republicans to close loopholes and raise taxes. How is this all going to get solved? Our model tells us that House Republicans have to either get their way or be bought off. The president either has to cave, allowing the Bush-era tax cuts to stay the same for the wealthy, or offer something to sweeten the deal. House Republicans owe their majority to the Tea Party. Getting them to vote for a tax-rate increase is not going to come cheap. One solution is a promise from the president and Democrats to reduce tax rates at some future date when paired with comprehensive tax reform. (Obama wants taxes to go up on those making over $250,000 now but is open to having those rates come back down as a part of reform.) Would Republicans buy such a promise about the future? Why on earth would they trust that these lower rates would ever come to pass? One possible offering the president could make would be a major concession on Medicare and Medicaid. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the president was committed to hard choices. If he's not going to bend on tax rates and has ruled out touching Social Security (as he essentially has), then there's only one place left where the president can find real money in the budget-cutting game: health care entitlements. That would show that he was serious about shared sacrifice, and if the changes the president agrees to are large enough, they'd give Republicans cover to accept tough tax changes. It would also be pretty big news. So let's amend our model. If the president agrees to change the eligibility requirements for Medicare, that would be worth pausing during the office party. Then we'd have to see if House Republicans would buy it."	"Would House Republicans Actually Vote for a ""Fiscal Cliff"" Deal That Would Raise Tax Rates?"	['Carney', 'Corker', 'Obama']	[]

Any trip home, like the one I'm going to make on Thursday, becomes a tour of friends and family who want me to explain the inside story of the election one more time. I end up pointing these people to good articles by other people, by insiders and investigative reporters, and this usually gives me enough time to run away. You can try it, too. This may have felt like a dull election at times, but it was one of the most pointed clashes of ideologies and strategies in decades. Your own family might want to quote back Saturday Night Live or Daily Show segments; you can impress them by diving much deeper into the real story of the race. These are some of this election's must-read articles: Jim Messina, Obama's Enforcer
Ari Berman, The Nation Sometimes you write a story with a thesis that gets blown to pieces--and a lot of bread crumbs leading to the actual truth. Ari Berman's 2011 profile of Barack Obama's campaign manager revealed just how little love Messina could expect from progressives. The new guy, a veteran of Sen. Max Baucus' office, would run a ""cautious, controlling, top-down in structure"" campaign, pouring acid on the grassroots. Luckily for Obama, it didn't happen, and the article now looks like a smorgasboard of foreshadowing. After the 2010 election, Messina spoke at the winter meeting of the Democracy Alliance, a group of wealthy progressive funders. He gave two PowerPoint presentations, including one on the administration's accomplishments--the stimulus, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, healthcare and financial reform. The other was on what was still to come--immigration reform, the START treaty, repealing DADT. ""Jim, you're missing a word,"" one donor told him during the Q&A. ""What word?"" Messina responded. ""The word 'jobs,'"" the donor said. The smartass donor sounds right, but he doesn't see how Messina will use those box-checked accomplishments to excite the Democratic base, and he doesn't foresee a future in which the jobs picture might be good enough to save Obama. The Romney Economy
Benjamin Wallace-Wells, New York Long before the Obama campaign or the super PACs launched their attacks on Bain Capital, Wallace-Wells decided to tell the company's history. The result took something previously relegated to gross campaign ads and revealed that ... well, it would be hard to defend even without those gross campaign ads. Private equity seemed to provide an early warning of broader changes. In three years during the early nineties, the Princeton economist Henry Farber has found, roughly 10 percent of American white-collar male managers lost their jobs. For the first time, according to data collected through the General Social Survey, white-collar workers were nearly as worried about losing their jobs as blue-collar workers. Those white-collar workers who kept their jobs worked harder, and the compensation that had once been spread through the broader middle ranks of corporations now collected at the top. In 1980, a CEO had earned about 35 times the wages of an average worker; by 1990, it was about 80; and by 2000, it was about 300. A good companion piece: Robert Draper's look at Priorities USA, the at-first-derided pro-Obama duper PAC that focused like a UAW shop laser on Bain and drove up Romney's negatives. Protesters Raise Cloud of Sand as Romney Raises $3 million in N.Y.
Maeve Reston, Los Angeles Times Pity the poor ""embedded"" reporter. Her news organization spends at least $1,000 per day, usually more, to follow a presidential candidate. She gets on the plane, gets off the plane, gets on the plane, gets off the plane, maybe catches some time with campaign aides, almost never gets any time with the candidate. (I really felt for these embeds every time a big news network would bigfoot in and talk to Romney. They weren't schlepping from Marriott to Marriott for the privilege.) But the great reporters took their opportunities when they arrived. My favorite example: Reston hassling the people entering a high-dollar Romney fundraiser and finding out what they think. ""I don't think the common person is getting it,"" she said from the passenger seat of a Range Rover stamped with East Hampton beach permits. ""Nobody understands why Obama is hurting them. ""We've got the message,"" she added. ""But my college kid, the baby sitters, the nails ladies--everybody who's got the right to vote--they don't understand what's going on. I just think if you're lower income--one, you're not as educated, two, they don't understand how it works, they don't understand how the systems work, they don't understand the impact."" Coal Miner's Donor
Alec MacGillis, New Republic One of the best, least-bubbled reporters who covered the race, MacGillis made a series of reporting trips to Ohio that made him an early debunker of baseless ""Romney surge"" hype. He also broke plenty of news about how relaxed campaign finance laws were cracking open the dam for Republican campaigns. Robert Murray of Murray Energy, a coal magnate backer of Romney, helped inflate the size of the candidate's pro-coal crowds and donors. Internal Murray documents show just how upset Murray becomes when employees fail to join the giving. In missives, he cajoles employees to attend fund-raisers and scolds them when they or their subordinates do not. In cases of low participation, reminders from his lieutenants have included tables or spreadsheets showing how each of the eleven Murray subsidiaries was performing. And at least one note came with a list of names of employees who had not yet given. ""What is so difficult about asking a well-paid, salaried employee to give us three hours of his/her time every two months?"" Murray writes in a March 2012 letter. ""We have been insulted by every salaried employee who does not support our efforts."" He concludes: ""I do not recall ever seeing the attached list of employees ... at one of our fund-raisers."" Plenty of reporters went to an Ohio rally for Romney where these workers were used as props. They mostly just took filtered Instagrams of them and hopped back on the plane. MacGillis followed the pay stubs. Meet the Ohio Voters Who Are Killing Romney's Campaign
Molly Ball, Atlantic The campaign's most consistently wrong pundits, like the New Republic's Bill Galston, eschewed reporting for stereotypes. How could anyone explain Obama's strong poll numbers in Ohio? Wasn't he bleeding white voters? Ball, one of the great middle-to-long-form writers on the campaign, headed to Belmont County in southeastern Ohio and actually interviewed those mysterious creatures. On their lawns! ""I think Obama's more for the regular working class people, and Romney's for the big business and the well-to-do,"" said Eric Burkhead, the road and cemetery superintendent for Kirkwood Township, working on a truck in the gravel driveway of the local garage. The 66-year-old didn't like what he saw happening with coal and wasn't wild about Obamacare, but he planned to vote for Obama. On Election Day, Belmont did turn red and broke for Romney by eight points. But only 30,717 voters turned out, down nearly 2,000 from four years earlier--which sort of proved Ball's point. The Real American surge to Romney just wasn't there. The Incredibly Dumb Political Spending of 2012
Ben Smith, Buzzfeed Before it was conventional wisdom, Smith poked a few holes in the fundraiser curtains. Did mega-donors make it easier for Mitt Romney to catch up with Barack Obama? Yes. Did they know what they were doing? Not really. But strategists knew how to create that fantasy and get paid for it. What the SuperPACs are using to fill that gap is hardly the laser-focused, hard-hitting stuff of textbook campaigns. Instead it's a welter of mixed messages. One pre-convention week in August, for instance, the Romney campaign was focused on what his aides said was the most effective ad of the cycle, an attack on Obama for weakening some work requirements in the federal welfare law. But the SuperPACs were offering an array of different messages: American Crossroads was attacking Obama over the deficit; Americans for Prosperity was dwelling on a failed solar energy company, Solyndra; and Restore Our Future was talking about jobs. Beware the Crowdsmanship: When It Comes to Campaign Rallies, Does Size Matter?
Robert Mann, bobmannblog.com The Romney campaign tried and tried to convince reporters that a surge of unpollable momentum was going to tip the election their way. Their final evidence: Huge crowds in swing states, led by a crowd of as many as 30,000 people in the Cincinnati suburb of West Chester. (I was at that rally and met a decent number of out-of-staters who just wanted to see Romney.) Standing alone in a corner, with a stack of old Life and Time pieces about older doomed campaigns, was Robert Mann. All the boasting and exaggerations of campaign flacks, and the creative work of Photoshop artists, should give political reporters pause. Many of them live in a protective bubble supplied by the candidate, so it's understandable that they will occasionally be susceptible to the spin. But that makes it all the more important to be careful and resist the urge to read too much into the size of campaign crowds in the waning days of a presidential campaign. Even losing campaigns, it seems, are adept at turning out huge crowds as Election Day approaches. Why Obama Is Better at Getting Out the Vote
Sasha Issenberg, Slate The best and most consistently correct reporter on voter turnout models was my colleague at this magazine. He published one book (The Victory Lab) and a series of pieces that effectively predicted how strong the Obama-Biden ground game would be. His final pre-election take explained it all, slicing through a bunch of puffy spin about the GOP campaigns and explaining why OFA's data were so dominating. McCain's Last Laugh
Robert Costa, National Review It's hard to pick just one article by Robert Costa, an insanely industrious campaign reporter. Pick any key moment from the primary or the general or Wisconsin's two-year Ragnarok, and Costa was probably there, with solid inside sources. (See his story on Romney's debate win, filed five or six minutes after Denver.) This piece demonstrates just how haphazard and confident the Romney campaign was, while giving us, simultaneously, a glimpse at Mitt Romney's future and at the future awaiting Barack Obama when ever-more-embittered Republicans welcome him back. ""It's like the old horse that draws the milk wagon,"" McCain tells me, when I pull him aside near the Legion's noisy bar. ""I feel at home here and places like it. It's very nostalgic in some ways, especially today."" Of course, he'll always have some regrets about his presidential campaign, but to him, bitterness is a choice. ""I've watched other defeated candidates, for the presidency and other offices, and you almost feel sad,"" he says. ""They go into a shell and get angry. But you know what? Life is too short. I mean, my gosh, you can't just stay angry."" The Real Reasons You Waited Hours in Line To Vote
Richard Pildes, Atlantic The great lasting irony of the 2012 might be this: Republican governors who passed voting rights restrictions can't claim credit for flipping any election results, and that will make it easier for them to keep on passing restrictions. Wisconsin's Scott Walker is already talking about restricting same-day voter registration, even though there's zero proof it caused any problems or restricted fraudulent votes. Piles, who advised the Obama campaign on legal issues, does a good, hands-off job of explaining just how harebrained laws and incompetent officials ruin our elections. [P]oll workers now have to apply state election law for regular voters, the federal Help America Vote Act for those who are going to cast provisional ballots, and absentee-ballot laws for in-person absentee voting. Each category of voting has its own distinct set of rules to be mastered. Every additional layer of complexity creates more capacity to confuse poll workers and slow down the voting process, even if the law, such as the Help America Vote Act, is well intentioned. We have to assess the costs and benefits of these laws more fully. Absent a crisis, absent anybody talking about it, we probably won't. Here's a good way to fix that: Bring it up when you're trying to impress your wife's irritable Republican aunt. Make a convert. ""Why can't those dumb Floridians vote?"" shouldn't be the story. ""Why does anyone have to wait four hours to vote"" is the story."

28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/11/steven_spielberg_s_lincoln_can_it_teach_obama_about_how_to_handle_congress.html	"Steven Spielberg's Lincoln is so lush you feel like you're watching it in a velvet chair. The dark parlors and White House meeting rooms are full of fire and cigar smoke. The Lincoln played by Daniel Day Lewis seems so familiar it reminds you of the first time you heard him, except of course you never have. But after my wife and I watched the film, her first reaction was to say this: ""I kept thinking about health care."" She wasn't talking about the gritty scene at an Army hospital. She was talking about the Affordable Care Act. At the center of the film is Lincoln's fight to find the votes to pass the 13th Amendment, abolishing slavery, and though the bloody and muddy war scenes make the stakes quite clear, at its heart the movie is a math problem: How does Lincoln get two-thirds of the tick marks on the vote tally sheet to go his way? That's how a story about ending the enslavement of an entire race can remind you of health care reform. The math is the same in all big legislative fights: How hard do you push to get what is right when pushing too hard can spoil the whole enterprise? Not all legislative fights have the same moral weight. In much of the film, you see the tonnage in Lincoln's face and his hands and his walk, but when it comes to the legislation, while Lincoln captures the nuts and bolts, it lacks that heft. President Obama has seen Spielberg's film and is a fan of the Doris Kearns Goodwin book, Team of Rivals, upon which it is based. Screenwriter Tony Kushner has said Obama liked it. So it makes you wonder what lessons a newly re-elected president with a gift for oratory might take from it, especially when our own president faces his own fight with a lame duck Congress. The first lesson is that great oratory doesn't get you votes. The movie starts and ends with Lincoln's famous speeches. First, a hokey scene in which Union soldiers parrot the Gettysburg address back to its author  and then a final scene depicting Lincoln's second inaugural address. But the main drama--the hunt for votes--has almost nothing to do with the president's power of public persuasion. In the scenes where Lincoln tries to convince individual lawmakers, he is forgettable (an amazing achievement for Day-Lewis, who is so spectacular that even his labored footfalls seem meaningful). The next lesson is not one available to our current president: Votes are for sale. At the start of the film, Lincoln is faced with trying to secure two kinds of votes: conservative Republicans and a smaller number of Democrats who have been voted out of office in the election of 1864 but who can still vote in the lame duck session. He employs a crew of political hacks who look like Mumford and Sons session men to offer Democrats plum postings after they've left office. This is how Lincoln gets a good share of the hard votes. Vote buying is largely unavailable to the modern president, certainly when it comes to influencing members of the opposite party. Remember how quickly Obama had to back off the Cornhusker Kickback, an attempt to sweeten the health care bill for Democrat Ben Nelson.* This points out an immediate caution for anyone trying to draw lessons from this film. A lot has changed. Lincoln's careful strategy employed in this film could not have survived the first tweet. The more useful skill a modern-day president could mimic is Lincoln's careful management of his allies. He secures conservative Republican votes by stringing the lawmakers along. (This is a crucial presidential attribute also effectively used by FDR.) Lincoln's fellow Republicans will vote for the 13th amendment if he promises to entertain peace entreaties from the South. Lincoln says he will do just that and sends  Francis Preston Blair to Richmond to meet with the Confederates. But if word leaks that any conversation with the South is underway, it will sap the energy for passing the amendment, which supporters hope will help bring an end to the war. In one telling scene, a couple petitioning the president say they are for the amendment, but when asked by Secretary of State Seward if they would be for the amendment if the war were over, they lose all interest. Throughout the film, Lincoln simultaneously pushes for the vote while stalling the approach of the Confederate representatives heading North to talk peace. He never quite lies to his allies, but he manages their intake of information so that they hear what they want to hear--and stay in line. Many Democrats today find Obama's manner too timid and accommodating, a charge the radical Republicans of Lincoln's day leveled at their president. Their leader, Thaddeus Stevens, wants full rights for slaves. Lincoln, who is being mercilessly hammered by Democrats for his anti-slavery activism, wants Stevens to tone down his rhetoric--to take a pragmatic approach to passing this controversial amendment. Full rights for blacks might be the ultimate goal, but such hot rhetoric on the floor of the House will doom the vote because it will frighten off Democrats. Lincoln is repeatedly blamed for being too deliberate and slow. Leading from behind, you might call it. But what Lincoln knew was that he could not go any faster than the public allowed him. He didn't have pollsters, but at one point in the film, he puts on his coat to walk the streets for a ""public opinion bath,"" his term for his wanderings that put him in touch with people, so that he could know the country's mind. Lincoln spent more days outside the White House than in it during his last year. Alas for our own pragmatic president, this is another approach that's not readily available in the 21st century. In the end, Lincoln wins over Stevens who, while debating on the floor of the House, refuses to be pushed into declaring his more radical private beliefs. He repeats again and again that he wants nothing more than equality for blacks ""under the law."" It is an act of self-denial and lawyerly weaseling that infuriates his Democratic opposition but gives the newspapermen looking down from the gallery nothing incendiary to write. As a result, the vote coalition sticks together. Lincoln has been heralded as a great civics lesson. It is a good but not great one, and not just because there's sadly little inspiration for our own president to draw from the movie. Stevens' act of self-denial makes you want to cheer, but the power dynamics and motivations of various parties are confusing and unexplained at times. At one point, when one of Lincoln's allies in the House complains that he can't get the votes the president thunders, ""I am clothed in immense power--you will procure me these votes."" In the previous two hours of the movie Lincoln has been sweating every vote, but suddenly he's acting like he's Gandalf--as if a bold declaration will get him what he needs. The actual counting of votes is clear enough--we even see Mary Todd Lincoln's tally sheet as she watches from the gallery. But we get no sense of the inner turmoil these lawmakers are going through. Why does the gentleman from Kentucky, to whom Lincoln has appealed, change his vote? In one of several comical vote-buying scenes, one of the political hacks is nearly shot by a Democratic lawmaker he's trying to bribe. Members of the House get off some good lines as they forever yell at each other, and their play-acting and verbal sparring can feel removed from today's debates only by the old-timey language. The film is trying to show the gap between Lincoln's lofty ends and earthly means, but the debate over the amendment banning slavery should feel more weighty in the moment than today's posturing about the fiscal cliff. Members wept after the amendment was passed, but there's little in the film's portrayal of the vote hunt that makes us want to weep, too. By contrast, when, early in the movie, we see Lincoln lie down by the fire next to his sleeping son, you feel his weariness, and you ache for him. When his wife rages at the president for allowing their older boy to go to war, your shoulders tense with her rage. The personal dramas of a man who faced as much as Lincoln did are always going to outstrip the legislative fight, but when it comes to the vote, which consumes so much of the movie, in the end it often just feels like so much math.

Great Man has a Great Fall, and everything about his life gets recast through the same tawdry prism. A counterrevisionism phase will surely soon follow, then a counter to that counter ... these things often take months or years to settle. (Then again, it might take a mere six weeks.) Meanwhile, let us consider one of the most bizarre spectacles of revisionism in the annals of not just Petraeus but anybody: an op-ed in the Sunday Review section of the Sunday New York Times, ""A Phony Hero for a Phony War,"" by Lucian K. Truscott IV. I know little about Truscott except that his grandfather was a legendary World War II commander and that he himself followed the family footsteps into West Point, left the Army soon after, and wrote a highly regarded novel, Dress Gray, which caused a great stir at the time (1978) for piercing the dome of sexual scandal and secrecy at West Point in a way that no previous author had ventured. Judging from his op-ed, though, a few things are clear: Truscott romanticizes his grandfather's era, his view of the modern Army is remarkably shallow, and he seems to have no understanding of what Petraeus was trying to accomplish in Iraq. There is much to criticize about Petraeus, and even more about those wars, but Truscott paints a cartoon portrait--even characterizing its commanders as ""Dave and his merry band of Doonesbury generals""--that makes Mad magazine look like social realism by comparison. From the first line (""Fastidiousness is never a good sign in a general officer""), the piece is, at best, a head-scratcher. Truscott chortles over the ""beribboned finery"" of Petraeus' uniform and likens him to such ""strutting military peacocks"" as Douglas MacArthur and William Westmoreland--fun stuff at first glance, though on reflection, Petraeus (whatever else might be said of him) is the opposite of those other two generals in every way imaginable. Truscott then hints at a thesis. A general's job, he writes, is ""winning wars--something we and our generals stopped doing about the time that MacArthur gold-braided his way around the stalemated Korean War."" But the Korean stalemate can hardly be linked to MacArthur, who wanted to ""win"" the war by invading the north and nuking China. Surely Truscott isn't wistful about a similar notion of victory, is he? He then moans that Petraeus, in Iraq and Afghanistan, ""failed to conquer the countries we invaded, and ended up occupying undefeated nations."" But, in both those wars, Petraeus took command in the occupation phase, well after Saddam Hussein and the Taliban had fallen. By this point, the goal was hardly--nor should they have been--to ""conquer"" the nations. Then comes the deep brow-furrower: ""The genius of General Petraeus,"" Truscott writes, ""was to recognize early on that the war he had been sent to fight in Iraq wasn't a real war at all."" (Italics added.) Apparently, to Truscott, a war isn't ""a real war"" unless it's about maneuvering tanks, conquering territory, and subjugating defeated peoples. He suggests as much a bit later: ""The fact is that none of our generals have led us to a victory since men like Patton and my grandfather, Lucian King Truscott, Jr., stormed the beaches of North Africa and southern France with blood in their eyes and military murder on their minds."" Here's where Truscott gets get really confusing. He writes, ""Those generals, in my humble opinion, were nearly psychotic in their drive to kill enemy soldiers and subjugate enemy nations."" It's unclear: Is that a good thing? Apparently not, for the next sentence reads: ""Thankfully, we will probably never have cause to go back to those blood-soaked ways."" But then he denounces Petraeus for insufficient blood-soaking. ""The generals who won World War II,"" he writes, ""were the kind of men who, as it was said at the time, chewed nails for breakfast, spit tacks at lunch, and picked their teeth with their pistol barrels."" By contrast, he goes on, ""General Petraeus probably flosses."" First of all, this nail-chewing business is the stuff of pulp fiction. The stereotype might fit MacArthur, George Patton, and Truscott's grandfather (who, as Tom Ricks notes, was as preening as they come)--but not remotely the likes of George Marshall, Dwight Eisenhower, James Gavin, or many others. Second, he seems to suggest that it's bad--a sign of preciousness, maybe effeminacy--that Petraeus ""probably flosses."" Is Truscott suggesting here, in a reversal of his earlier remarks, that MacArthur and Patton are admirable in their ""psychotic"" ravages? The key to Truscott's confusion may lie in his recollection of a conversation he had with Petraeus in the fall of 2003, when the general, then commander of the 101st Airborne Division, was occupying Mosul in northern Iraq: One of the first questions I asked him was what his orders had been. Was he ordered to ""take Mosul,"" I asked. No answer. How about ""Find Mosul and report back""? No answer. Finally, I asked him if his orders were something along the lines of ""Go to Mosul!"" He gave me an almost imperceptible nod. It must have been the first time an American combat infantry division had been ordered into battle so casually. This is a fair enough portrait, but Truscott draws precisely the wrong conclusion. The American leaders at the time were clueless. President George W. Bush had no aim other than to topple Saddam Hussein; he had no idea what to do after that. Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, the top U.S. military commander in Iraq, had no strategy or campaign plan for the occupation. True, Petraeus had no orders on what to do in Mosul, but what Truscott misses is that he devised his own orders--he set up a new political system, vetted candidates, got the local economy going again, reopened the university, reopened borders with Syria: He stabilized Mosul in a way that no other division commander was stabilizing his area of operation. And he did this by more than merely ""buying the loyalties of various factions,"" as Truscott charges. Truscott then makes a claim that might be interesting if it weren't encased in so many inaccuracies--that Petraeus' methods in Mosul ""were the kinds of things that prolong wars"" rather than win them. In one sense, Truscott might be right: If Iraq's political factions were ultimately uninterested in reconciling with one another, Petraeus' strategy may indeed have merely stretched out the conflict and deferred the reckoning. But three points need to be made here. First, Petraeus had no way of knowing this at the time; both in Mosul and later, in 2007, as U.S. commander in Iraq, he saw his goal as giving the factions ""breathing space,"" creating a ""zone of security,"" where they might reach a settlement in peace. It's not his fault that the factions had no interest in reaching such a settlement. Second, for as long as he was in command, Petraeus succeeded at what he set out to do, if only tactically and in the short term. In retrospect, a case can be made that it may have been wiser to pull out after Saddam fell, to let the Iraqis find their own way. But those weren't Petraeus' orders; whatever else might be said of him, he accomplished a great deal with what he had. Finally, America's big mistake in Iraq was invading it in the first place--and neither Petraeus nor any other general had anything to do with that decision. No question, over the past decade, a mystique has shrouded David Petraeus, and its chief sculptor has been Petraeus himself. As a young officer, his key mentors--John Galvin and Marcel ""Bruno"" Bigeard, both fighting and thinking generals--instructed him in the art of myth making for the purpose of building the troops' loyalty and the population's support for the mission. The mystique cracked on Nov. 9, when revelations of the affair with Paula Broadwell forced him to resign--and it has shattered into shards, as the affair's backstory turned more and more baroquely bizarre. But not all myths are hollow. Sometimes their cores have real substance. Petraeus isn't a god, but that doesn't mean he's a devil or a clown. One bright side of his demystification might be that we can finally have a debate about foreign policy and modern warfare--the merits, limits, and drawbacks of drones; the relevance of counterinsurgency doctrine; the appropriate place of counterterrorism--unencumbered by the politics of personality. Meanwhile, Lucian Truscott IV's snarky stab at iconoclasm says more about the hankering for a black-and-white playbook of villains and heroes than about the real world of complex grays."
