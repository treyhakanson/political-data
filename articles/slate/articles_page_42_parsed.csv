Of the two parts, Republicans have had the easiest time with ""repeal."" Since winning the majority in 2010, House Republicans have held 56 votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, with the latest attempt on Tuesday, a courtesy for the new members who haven't had a chance to voice their ritual distaste for the law. If you're feeling charitable, you can treat this focus on ""repeal"" as a consequence of circumstances. House Republicans could have crafted a bill to replace Obamacare, but then they would have had to make the compromises and pay the costs of building an alternative without the benefit of bringing it to law--as soon as any bill reached the Senate, Democrats would have killed it. But now, Republicans have all of Congress. If they want to replace Obamacare, they can. And on Wednesday, they took a step in that direction. With little fanfare, Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Richard Burr of North Carolina, and Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan unveiled their blueprint for Republican health reform. Called the ""Patient Choice, Affordability, Responsibility and Empowerment Act,"" it is mostly identical to an outline released last year by Hatch, Burr, and now-retired Sen. Tom Coburn. The centerpiece of that plan was a modest cap on the employer-sponsored insurance tax break that began at 65 percent of the average comprehensive plan. For this year, they've replaced it with a tax on health benefits. ""Workers,"" notes the New York Times in its description of this year's proposal, ""would have to pay federal income tax on the value of employer-provided health benefits that exceed certain annual thresholds--$12,000 for individuals and $30,000 for families."" The remaining provisions are similar to the ones in last year's proposal. The GOP plan would allow consumers to purchase insurance regardless of pre-existing conditions, as long as they were continually insured. For Americans who don't have insurance, the plan would provide a one-time enrollment period. Like Obamacare, the replacement proposal includes subsidies for low- and middle-income Americans, but in the form of tax credits instead of a payment to the insurer. But these would be much less generous, with a threshold well below the one established by the ACA. The Republican plan eliminates the federal exchanges and ends regulation of insurance benefits, allowing--for example--an insurer to offer a comprehensive plan that didn't include maternity coverage. The largest changes come to Medicaid. Under their plan, Republicans would end the expansion, and replace it with an allotment based on the number of poor in each state. At most, states could use these new funds on pregnant women, children, and the disabled. Young adults can stay on their parents' insurance plans until they turn 26, and the ban on lifetime coverage limits remains. And for young people who purchase insurance, it's cheaper; the GOP will allow insurers to charge older customers up to five times the amount they charge for their younger counterparts. The consequences of the proposal are straightforward: By ending Obamacare in its entirety and placing limits on Medicaid, it would eliminate insurance for millions of Americans and make it harder for middle- and working-class people to purchase coverage. And while it's described as a plan to save money, the truth is that it accomplishes this by reducing care for the poor and raising costs on everyone else. In other words, this isn't a plan to achieve universal coverage. That's simply not a Republican goal, and it's part of the reason it has proven politically difficult to craft an alternative. We don't think everyone should have health insurance just isn't an appealing message. Which gets to something important about this whole enterprise: The CARE Act is a blueprint. There is no legislation to score or any bill to debate. It's just a package of ideas--one approach for when, or if, the party decides to pass a genuine alternative to Obamacare. Put differently, it's probably a dead letter. Even when there were no costs to action last year, Republicans couldn't manage to get behind a proposal. And while there's a chance the party needs to act to repair the health care system--if it takes a blow from the Supreme Court--it's not at all clear that the party is willing to agree to the trade-offs it takes to actually craft and pass a bill, and not just talk about one. The simple fact is that Democrats paid a huge electoral cost for their willingness to upend the health care system and pursue comprehensive reform. Arguably, it's the whole reason Republicans are even in a position to debate repeal and replace. The real question for Republicans isn't whether they'll have a plan--if they're serious and sincere, lawmakers will build one the party can agree to. The real question is whether they'll sacrifice their political success to the burden of reform."	Why Republicans Can't Come Up With a Real Alternative to Obamacare	['Upton', 'Hatch', 'Burr']	[]

Since then, the gun-law debate has receded in Washington. But it is flaring in the states, where advocates on both sides see more hope for action than in the gridlocked capital. And at the moment, the most remarkable fight may be the one shaping up in Pennsylvania, where the National Rifle Association is facing off not against big national gun-control groups, but against many of the state's towns and cities, in a brazen push to get them to repeal their gun-related laws. It all started about five years ago, when a group of Pennsylvania cities, frustrated with the difficulty of getting gun-law reforms passed in the Republican-controlled state legislature, started passing laws and ordinances on their own. Their highest priority was requiring gun owners to report lost or stolen guns--a law that was intended to make it harder for gun traffickers to claim, after a crime gun was traced back to them, that the gun had been lost or stolen before the crime was committed. Most of the states bordering Pennsylvania had such a law, but it was going nowhere in Harrisburg. Eventually, more than 100 towns and cities passed the requirement. ""The state was not taking any action on it and by putting together support at the grassroots level and showing that mayors and council could take action, we hoped it would compel action at the state level,"" says Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto, who was on the city council at the time. ""It's the grassroots level that brings change to state capitals and then Washington, D.C."" Such laws are anathema to the gun lobby, which argues they violate the Fifth Amendment's bar against self-incrimination, since reporting a lost or stolen gun might implicate someone for other violations. Gun-rights advocates have also been peeved over another set of ordinances passed by Pennsylvania towns, banning guns from parks or other public areas, as well as by laws passed by Philadelphia that, among other things, limit assault weapons and gun ownership for domestic-violence abusers. Gun-rights groups argue that most of the local laws are in violation of a 1974 state law that bars municipalities against passing restrictions that are pre-empted by state gun laws. But they have had trouble getting the laws overturned, because that requires finding someone who can show injury from the laws to bring a lawsuit challenging them. So the gun lobby got the state legislature to change the rules of the game. Late last year, Pennsylvania lawmakers passed a bill, loosely modeled on a Florida law, to make it possible for any state resident or any gun-rights group to which they belong to challenge local gun laws in court. The law, Act 192, is an explicit carve-out for gun-rights groups from customary legal procedures--challenges of school-prayer restrictions, for instance, are typically brought by actual students who can show that their rights have been infringed by the restrictions. Not only that, but the law requires that towns and cities pay the legal fees of any plaintiffs who successfully challenge their gun laws in court. In other words, the NRA, with its headquarters in northern Virginia and annual revenues well above $200 million, can sue towns and cities, and expect them to pay its costs if it wins. And, almost immediately, the lawsuits have arrived. The NRA has sued Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Lancaster, a town with a population of 59,325. (Lancaster probably ranked as a prime target since its mayor has served as the chairman of the state chapter of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, the group co-founded by former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg.) A Pennsylvania-based gun-rights group, Firearms Owners Against Crime, has sued Harrisburg, as has a Texas-based pro-gun rights legal outfit called U.S. Law Shield. Meanwhile, many towns and cities across the state--from Norristown and Franconia outside Philadelphia to Munhall and Clairton in the Monongahela Valley to Erie on the shores of the Great Lakes--have rushed to repeal their gun-related ordinances, worried they won't be able to afford to fend off these legal actions or, worst case, pay the NRA's legal bills, alongside their school and snow-removal budgets. ""These are risk-free lawsuits. You might get your fees covered or at the least, you get towns to drop their laws. It's a jobs program for gun-lobby lawyers and an NRA bullying tactic for local towns,"" says Shira Goodman, director of CeaseFire PA, the state's main gun-control group. ""They're giving special rights to the NRA."" The NRA and its lawyer in Pennsylvania did not respond to requests for an interview. But Kim Stolfer, chairman of the Firearms Owners Against Crime, which played a leading role in getting Act 192 passed, gave a vigorous defense of the law. He said that the local ordinances forbidding guns on public property were weaker than state laws already on the books forbidding guns on school grounds and in courthouses. The ordinances, he added, had nonetheless caused legal hassles for law-abiding gun owners, such as a man who was arrested for moving his gun from his luggage to his person in a nonsecured part of the Pittsburgh airport. Local authorities rarely press these cases, he said, likely because they know the laws are on shaky ground, but not before gun owners incur hefty legal fees. As for the laws requiring reporting of lost and stolen guns, Stolfer said, there is little evidence of their effectiveness, given how few cases local authorities bring against straw purchasers, people who buy guns and then pass them on to those who are forbidden to purchase firearms or don't want their names on record. ""They have no reason to enact local laws except to make a statement or for political demagoguery,"" he said. ""They want a collective network of laws that are so ambiguous that they create fear of prosecution and uncertainty for people that own guns as to whether they can be held liable."" And he sees nothing wrong with gun-rights groups getting the right to challenge local laws, regardless of whether they've been personally injured. It was no different, he said, than the NAACP being able to bring a case ""against a restaurant that says 'no blacks allowed.' "" ""Why should you have to violate a law and be prosecuted before you're able to challenge it?"" he said. ""Why should we take a civil right and have people have to go to jail and then challenge it?"" The cities in the sights of Stolfer's group and the NRA scoff at these arguments. State laws regarding guns on public grounds are not adequate, they say--for one thing, the rule banning guns in courthouses exposes the many government offices that are not in courthouses. (In 2013, three people were killed in a shooting at a township meeting in the Poconos.) And just because there haven't been many straw-purchasing cases brought doesn't mean the lost-and-reporting rule isn't helping the police track down some missing guns, says Lancaster Mayor Rick Gray, a Democrat who, like his Republican predecessor, has kicked in $1,000 of his own money for a local legal defense fund to take on the NRA. ""The NRA will say, 'This is just window-dressing, they haven't prosecuted anybody.' But then why are you filing a lawsuit against a law that doesn't have any effect to it?"" As for the provision giving the NRA the right to sue, he said, it's a blatant carve-out. ""Lobbies like the NRA are ... special interests,"" he said. ""They do everything they can to make sure the decisions affecting them are made by the people they have the most control over. They don't have control over mayors ... and they do have control over the General Assembly."" Lancaster, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia are not only not backing down in the face of the NRA lawsuits; they have filed one of their own against the state, arguing that Act 192 is unconstitutional because, in the legislature's rush to get it passed before Republican Gov. Tom Corbett lost his bid for re-election, they attached it to a measure having to do with the theft of scrap metals. This, the cities say, violates the state constitution's bar against passing unrelated measures in a single law. That lawsuit is now pending in the state's Commonwealth Court. Regardless of how the legal battle ends, the Pennsylvania showdown points to the essential conundrum in having the gun debate devolve to the state and local level in the face of a Washington stalemate. On the one hand, it makes sense for cities grappling with gun violence to pass laws suited to their circumstances, and to political environments where there is more support for sensible gun laws than the conventional wisdom about the NRA's power might suggest. But on the other hand, such a patchwork approach opens itself up to the argument of gun-rights groups that it causes confusion on the part of gun owners or conflicts with state laws. Not to mention that the patchwork approach is often less effective--since guns travel easily across local and state borders, lost-and-stolen reporting laws or background checks are far more effective if they're universal. This is the bind that Rep. Patrick Harkins, a Democrat from Erie County, was in when Act 192 came up last year. He said he sees why some cities would want tougher gun laws than the state's rural areas, but also worries about the legal ""hodgepodge"" this creates across the state. At the same time, he was bothered by the bill's provision giving the NRA and other gun-rights groups a special right to sue and collect legal fees. ""I don't like that,"" he said. ""The Founders would be ashamed of something like that. That's tug of war by the bully."" Yet he voted for the bill, which passed easily. Was it the pressure of the NRA? Not in his own case, he said, but plenty of his colleagues in Harrisburg are ""beholden"" to it. ""The NRA,"" he said, ""has got people here by the short and curlies."""

2	2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/conservatives_and_liberals_hold_anti_science_views_anti_vaxxers_are_a_bipartisan.html	"In the nearly 48 hours since President Obama, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul made their comments on vaccination, the issue has become a partisan sideshow. Bolstered by media critiques of Christie and Paul, Democrats gleefully accused Republicans of anti-science views. And conservatives, miffed by a perceived double standard, replied in kind. ""It is indefensible to spin this as a problem for Republicans,"" wrote Mollie Hemingway, senior editor for the Federalist, pointing to the prevalence of vaccine skeptics in liberal enclaves like Marin County, California, and the presence of the same in liberal magazines like Mother Jones, Rolling Stone, and Salon. Her colleague, fellow senior editor David Harsanyi, went further, listing ""five ways liberals ignore science,"" from anti-vaccination and anti-genetically modified foods dogma, to global warming ""alarmism,"" fracking, and a whole host of parascience beliefs. ""Among those who do believe extraterrestrials are hanging around, 69 percent are Democrats, a far higher number than Republicans,"" he writes, citing a 2013 poll from YouGov and the Huffington Post. ""Democrats were also significantly more likely than Republicans to believe in fortune telling, and about twice as likely to believe in the astrology."" I sympathize with the impulse behind both arguments. It's maddening to see thoughtful friends and smart allies tarred with the brush of ""anti-science,"" especially when the charge still stings. The fame of Neil deGrasse Tyson or the massive popularity of fictional characters like Tony Stark is a sure sign that science--or at least, a crude scientism--retains great influence in public life, even as the broad culture faces a crisis of confidence in authority. To stand against science in many places is to invite stigma and disdain. Which is to say that overall, both Hemingway and Harsanyi are right: Fairness requires an evenhanded look at the presence of anti-science beliefs on the left and the right. With that in mind, vaccine skepticism is mostly ecumenical. The Pew Research Center finds modest differences in views about vaccination--34 percent of Republicans, 33 percent of independents, and 22 percent of Democrats believe parents should have final say on vaccination--while we know from anecdotes that vaccine rejection is present in conservative religious communities (like the Amish in Ohio) as well as in crunchy college-town communes like Boulder, Colorado. In fact, the available data shows stability in anti-vaccination views across ideology--neither side is substantially more likely than the other to hold anti-vaccine beliefs. Which gets to the problem of this conversation: It is annoyingly, frustratingly imprecise. Because we see the strongest anti-vaccination beliefs among clusters of affluent, left-wing parents, we assume a one-to-one connection--it's their politics that drive their conviction. And when their conversations turn to deceitful doctors and untrustworthy pharmaceuticals companies, that's a fair assumption to make. At the same time, as Dartmouth political scientist Brendan Nyhan makes clear, ""[P]olitical liberalism is part of a correlated cluster of beliefs and lifestyles in those places and isn't seemingly the most important explanatory factor in determining who's a vaccine skeptic."" That many vaccine skeptics are liberal doesn't make vaccination skepticism a liberal belief, driven by liberal concerns. And this is true for a whole host of anti-science beliefs--like belief in astrology--that are associated with particular political teams but aren't themselves political. All of which raises a question: When is an anti-science belief political? At the risk of tautology, it's when it becomes an agenda item for the party in question. Neither vaccine skepticism nor its cousin, GMO skepticism, is a particular Republican or Democratic problem, because neither party advances policies or agendas around either concern. (Although, if either issue developed a distinct political constituency, that could happen, which is one critical reason we don't want vaccination to become part of the partisan landscape.) By contrast, something like climate skepticism is a Republican problem--distinct from other anti-science beliefs--because of its huge currency in actual Republican politics. Sure, both parties have members with anti-science beliefs. But it's the GOP that's elevated a few of those beliefs to the party platform. Are Democrats in a similar situation? Not quite. While some conservatives describe abortion rights as anti-science--citing the truth that a human life is created at the moment of fertilization--that confuses a biological question with a metaphysical one. The question for most abortion rights advocates isn't whether the fetus is human, it's whether it stands as a person with the rights and protections of an infant or a child. That's a question for religion, philosophy, and law, not science. And this is true of a whole host of political and politicized beliefs. In the quest for partisan advantage, everyone scrambles to clothe his or her beliefs in the guise of objectivity. The reality, however, is that our beliefs are nothing of the sort. We construct them outside the scope of scientific observation, with ideas that come to us through custom, experience, and education, and for which science gives little confirmation or support. ""We see what we want to see,"" writes John Dewey in Human Nature and Conduct, ""We dwell upon favoring circumstances till they become weighted with reinforcing considerations."" In that environment, honest deliberation, he says, ""needs every possible help it can get against the twisting, exaggerating, and slighting tendency of passion and habit."" Instead of trying to attack each other for our fealty to science--or lack thereof--let's acknowledge the deep subjectivity of our views but try to use the tools and methods of science to help us inform and strengthen them; to challenge them, to sharpen them, and to try to root them in our shared reality."

3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/presidential_campaigns_are_beginning_far_too_early_the_permanent_campaign.html	"Let us entertain a moment's sympathy for Mitt Romney. No, not because he couldn't so much as stick up his perfectly coiffed head last month without being ridiculed by everyone from Rupert Murdoch to Jon Stewart. But because he felt pressured to make the decision about whether he could continue taking the ridicule, and mount a third presidential campaign, a full 21 months before Election Day 2016. It's a quadrennial complaint, but I'm going to make it anyway, and make it earlier than it's been made before, because the problem has somehow managed to get even worse: It is simply insane how much we've pushed up our presidential campaigns. It seemed like it couldn't get any worse than the past couple times--Barack Obama announced his 2008 candidacy on Feb. 10, 2007, timed to coincide roughly with Abraham Lincoln's birthday. For the 2012 campaign, the Republicans started holding debates in early May of 2011--a full year and a half before the election. But this year's early start has trumped even those. There are 644 days until Nov. 8, 2016. That is longer than the Spanish-American War, the Russo-Japanese War, and the Franco-Prussian War. It is as long as the period of the Nazis' Siege of Leningrad before the Soviets finally managed to get a sliver of access to the city. It is significantly longer than the span of time during which President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, and the creation of Medicare. It is enough time for some women to conceive and bear two successive children. And yet there was Romney being told that he had better make up his mind now if he wanted to be able to hold on to enough of his major donors from the past go-round and reassemble his campaign organization in key early primary states. And there was New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie being followed on a junket to London by at least three U.S. news organizations--who, last I checked, are not all swimming in profits, yet felt the need to follow this ""presidential candidate"" across the pond to watch him take in an Arsenal game and a production of Henry V at the Globe Theatre. (Granted, this allowed them to report his eyebrow-raising comments about vaccines during a visit to a vaccine manufacturer there.) And it's not just Christie who's getting nonstop candidate coverage: A week earlier, the Washington Post dispatched a reporter to Manitoba to watch Hillary Clinton deliver a speech. And there was Cokie Roberts saying on NPR's Morning Edition on Monday that Clinton should really hurry up and get in the race already rather than postponing her official kickoff for another few months. ""It's a mistake,"" Roberts said. ""She needs to be in the fray, dealing with the politics of this explaining exactly why she wants to be president. ... She needs to get out there and talk about the future with voters."" Right, because voters know so little about Clinton and because she'll have so little time during a virtually uncontested primary season and general election to get her message out. Look, I'm as guilty of this as anyone. I have spent the better part of the past year reporting lengthy pieces on likely 2016 contenders--see here, here, and here--though I've generally tried to make those pieces at least partly about subjects that reach beyond the candidates themselves and their 2016 prospects. I know full well the temptation as a two-term presidency heads into its proverbial fourth quarter to look ahead to the next act. I also believe that coverage of the presidential-prospect cattle calls--such as the Conservative Political Action Conference or the recent ""Iowa Freedom Summit""--can be justified on the grounds that it allows the media to get a sense of the tone and direction of a given party, regardless of what point in the election cycle it is or who is or isn't running. I also get the argument that our extended campaigns serve to vet candidates for Leader of the Free World in a way that the ultra-compact campaign seasons in, say, Germany or the United Kingdom do not. Still, 21 months? We need to confront the facts that the calendar has gotten seriously out of whack and that the permanent campaign is truly on the verge of devouring us all. Some historical perspective, to remind us how much things have changed: When George Romney, Mitt's father, famously damaged his prospects for the 1968 Republican nomination with his comments about having gotten a ""brain-washing"" from American generals in Vietnam, it was very early in the nominating cycle--in late August of 1967, long before any primary votes had been cast. Still: That was seven months later in the calendar than Mitt's decision not to run in 2016. When LBJ announced his decision not to seek the Democratic nomination in 1968, it was in a speech on March 31 of that year--the election year. By contrast, it is now looking likely that the majority of states will already have awarded their delegates by that point in the GOP primary next year. And when Mario Cuomo made the fateful decision not to board the plane that was waiting for him on the tarmac in Albany to take him to New Hampshire to register for the first-in-the-nation primary in 1992, it was in December of 1991, less than two months before the primary--and nearly 11 months later than the point in the calendar this year when Mitt Romney bowed out. It's no mystery why things have shifted forward as they have. There is the aforementioned tendency in the political media to look ahead to the next presidency instead of having to bother with the dregs of this one, in which a gridlocked Washington seems unlikely to produce much of consequence. There is the need to raise the vast sums of money considered necessary to be competitive these days ($50 million to $100 million for the primaries alone). There is the imperative on the part of the parties to have the nomination wrapped up as quickly as possible to avoid costly infighting and marshal resources for the general election. (The Republicans have moved their 2016 convention all the way up to July.) But since we know what's driving the shift, there is some hope for reforming the process, at least at the margins. Campaign finance reform, which even some prominent Republicans are now talking about, could reduce the fundraising demands at least somewhat. The parties could do a better job of penalizing states that try to leapfrog earlier in the calendar, as several major Southern states are now threatening to do with their GOP primaries next year. And the media can try, just a bit, to restrain its forward-looking impulse and keep at least some of its focus on the here and now. Gridlocked as Washington is, there are major issues to be dealt with, from a huge looming trade deal to the tenuousness of Obamacare to a broken immigration policy. Out in state capitals, there are big budget battles with serious consequences for millions of taxpayers and schoolchildren, not to mention fights over water rights, shale fracking, and school curriculum standards. The Red Arrow Diner can wait--it's not going anywhere. Meanwhile, there's a whole rest of a country out there, waiting to be covered. That, too, counts as ""being in the fray."""

""You should get your kids vaccinated,"" said a blunt President Obama in an interview with NBC News, ""I understand that there are families that, in some cases, are concerned about the effect of vaccinations ... [but] the science is, you know, pretty indisputable."" On the other side, by contrast, was New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who didn't endorse anti-vaccination beliefs but left a little space for them to breathe. ""Mary Pat and I have had our children vaccinated, and we think that it's an important part of being sure we protect their health and the public health,"" said the likely Republican presidential candidate while in Cambridge, England, ""I also understand that parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well, so that's the balance that the government has to decide."" And Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, weighing in Monday, not only said that vaccination should be voluntary, but claimed outright that vaccines were tied to autism. ""I've heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines."" The president, of course, is right on this question. Public health depends on near-universal vaccinations. It's how we protect children, the elderly, and others from diseases that can easily pierce weakened immune systems. But while I support mass vaccination--and would vaccinate my children, if I had them--I can also understand the forces that drive parents to try to opt out of this particular obligation to society. Chief among them is fear. Read anti-vaccination websites or listen to anti-vaccination advocates--or just talk to the anti-vaccination believers in your life--and you'll sense the fear that permeates the movement. One father, writing for the website Modern Mom, acknowledged the risk of disease and the sometimes awful consequences of childhood contagions, but countered with this: ""[T]he same image runs through the mind of a parent who has fears about their child's 12-month [measles, mumps, and rubella] shot. 'Will my baby have an anaphylactic reaction? Could she be that 1 out of 1,000 that will have febrile convulsions?'

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/democrats_working_with_tea_party_against_obama_s_trade_deal_the_president.html	"Rep. David Young, an Iowa Republican, was recently at a Des Moines event commemorating the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. when he was buttonholed by an activist urging him to vote against giving President Obama trade-promotion authority--aka fast track--to allow him to expedite a giant new Asia-Pacific trade deal, the issue where Obama and congressional GOP leaders seem most likely to come to agreement this year. The activist, Matthew Covington, urged Young to beware of the executive overreach that Obama would be engaging in if he secured fast-track powers. ""I said, 'This is such a large trade deal and the Constitution gives Congress the authority to regulate that, not the president. This would give the authority to the president. But we elected you to give you that authority, to see what's in this trade deal, to make sure it doesn't jeopardize Iowa values,' "" recounted Covington. That sounds like a garden-variety pitch from a grass-roots constitutional conservative. Except Covington is no Tea Partier. He is an organizer with a 40-year-old progressive organization called Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement that has made its name in recent years fighting factory farming, payday lending, and wage-theft; is closely tied to labor unions; and last year hosted Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont socialist, for a barnstorming tour of Iowa. The organization, like many others on the left, is opposed to granting Obama fast-track authority, which requires Congress to vote on trade deals with an up or down vote, and to the huge new 12-nation trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Covington worries that the TPP will undermine U.S. wages and manufacturing, as many Americans believe NAFTA did, while also giving multinational corporations new powers to run roughshod over U.S. food safety and environmental regulations. To try to block fast track and the TPP, liberal groups and labor unions are not organizing only among their own but are also reaching across the spectrum to conservatives skeptical of fast track and TPP. This left-right alliance has been duly noted in recent months. What has gone underappreciated, though, is just how much the opponents of the trade deals on the left are appealing to the right very much on the right's own terms. After years of ridiculing the Tea Party movement's talk of Obama as an autocrat on issues such as immigration and health care, the left is now pushing those very buttons on trade, noting that fast track would give Obama vast powers and that the TPP would create a new international arbitration panel where corporations could challenge local, state, and national laws. Some left-leaning advocates are going so far as to link the trade issue to the conservative litany of Obama outrages: the IRS scrutiny of Tea Party groups, Benghazi, and the ""Fast and Furious"" gun-running fiasco, among others. Essentially, the left is saying to conservative Republicans: If you're worried about executive overreach and global governance, then you really had better get upset about fast track and TPP. ""I tell them I'm concerned about local communities being able to do what they want to,"" says Rep. Keith Ellison, the liberal Democrat from Minneapolis and a leading opponent of fast track and TPP, who has been reaching out to House Republicans on the issue. ""This is essentially an 'America' issue. The last thing I want is some international unelected body deciding these critical questions."" Lori Wallach, director of Global Trade Watch at Ralph Nader-founded Public Citizen, says she reminds conservatives that TPP would ""allow people to go to these extra-judicial tribunals to have the U.S. treasury give them compensation without appeal."" This cross-ideological coloring makes the trade debate the most idiosyncratic and entertaining issue in the rut that is national politics today. But whether it will be enough to block fast track and TPP is another matter. The fact is there are a striking number of conservative Republicans who normally rail against Obama's overreach and threats to national sovereignty but who are setting aside those concerns in this instance. Sens. Rand Paul and Ted Cruz have both come out for fast track and TPP, saying their desire to spur economic growth and assert American leadership abroad trump their constitutional misgivings. So have the Heritage Foundation and two of the biggest conservative activist groups, Freedom Partners and the Tea Party Express. Lining up against the trade deals are a host of other Tea Party-aligned groups and, so far, roughly 20 conservative House Republicans who have gone on the record opposing fast track. The issue has become a moment of truth for the Tea Party movement and conservative Republicans more generally: Do they mean what they've been saying all along about the need for checks and balances and constitutional restraints on the executive and global bodies like the U.N.? Or were those just handy rhetorical weapons for issues where Republicans opposed Obama, such as universal health care, weapons that can be laid aside when GOP leaders--and the business lobby--decide it's in their interest to do so? ""There's a great number of people in Congress on both sides of the aisle who are very beholden to big business--what I call the chamber of crony capitalism,"" says Jay Devereaux of Unite in Action, one of the Tea Party groups that received heightened scrutiny from the IRS. ""It's all about favors for their buddies, and the average American be damned and it's really unfortunate."" You can track the Tea Party split on the issue by following the Twitter feed of End Global Governance, the name given to an umbrella group of conservative organizations fighting against the trade deals on the Hill. The group, led by Tea Party activist Stephani Scruggs, has been visiting the offices of House Republicans and reporting its mixed results. The group reported with a distinct note of betrayal that Rep. Ken Buck, the conservative Coloradan who lost his Senate bid in 2010, was in favor of fast track, as was Rep. Tom Emmer, a new conservative House member from Minnesota. It was relieved, on the other hand, to report that it got a warmer reception in the office of Rep. Morgan Griffith, from western Virginia. (""I'm not likely to support something that gives the president so much authority,"" Griffith told me later. ""I'm not sure I have the confidence in the president and his people to get it right."") Scruggs told me that she and her allies have gotten a ""pretty good response"" overall but that it has definitely been disheartening to see so many conservative Republicans setting aside their usual wariness of Obama now. ""What comes into play here are really huge lobbies,"" she says. ""Big Ag comes in ... and they put on a lot of pressure, with compelling arguments that are really well-funded. Citizen activists like myself, we've got to work a little harder."" Meanwhile, out across the country, local Tea Party groups are agitating on the issue. Terry Batton, of the Barbour County Tea Party in Alabama, told me that fast track and TPP were hot topics at quarterly meeting of his state's Tea Party coalition. ""We're definitely against the trade agreements,"" he said. ""The long and short of it is that they're just giving away our sovereignty."" In Wisconsin, Sandi Ruggles of the state's chapter of the Eagle Forum said she and her fellow members have been sending emails and making calls on the issue. ""Obama's giving himself way too much authority--that's an authority that should go through Congress,"" she said. Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government, has been going on conservative talk shows to speak against fast track and TPP--""Obamatrade""--and senses a growing opposition. ""There's beginning to be a real awakening on the right pointing out the absurdity of doing [the trade deals] when Republican legislators are complaining about Obama seizing too much power and entrusting even more power to the president, it's absurd, and really breaks faith with the voters who elected them in 2014,"" he said. ""The bottom line is we're going to see a number of Republicans coming out and expressing opposition to trade-promotion authority."" It was hard to detect any such opposition at the House and Senate hearings on trade last week. One after another, Republicans fell over each other to flatter the Obama administration's point man on the issue, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman, distinguishing him, and the agenda he is pushing, from the rest of the administration. Few challenged Froman's assertion that passing fast track, far from handing trade authority to Obama, would put Congress in the ""driver's seat"" on the issue. Rep. Paul Ryan, who was chairing the House hearing in his new capacity as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, joked that he normally would be as likely to trust Obama with new powers as he was to ""trust the Patriots with the footballs at Lambeau Field,"" but said that fast track was different. Rep. Peter Roskam, an Illinois Republican, trumped everyone with this softball greeting to Froman: ""Thank you for what you're doing for our country,"" he said. ""If you step back, this [trade deal] could be great. ... In your opinion, how great could it be?"" Afterward, Froman told me it was highly encouraging to see such support from Republicans, including conservative ones. He chalked it up to a recognition on the GOP side that voters want to see something get done in Washington and that ""the president's trade agenda is at the top of a list of issues that a lot of people feel they can work with the president on."" But the opposition is far from giving up. With a majority of House Democrats likely to oppose fast track, it would only take a sizable minority of House Republicans to derail it when it comes up for a vote in the next month or two. And so the traditional opponents of free-trade agreements are plugging along, stoking the fires of opposition on the right. The Teamsters have retained a Republican-leaning lobbying outfit, the Keelen Group, to reach out to conservative members. And the Coalition for a Prosperous America, a group that lobbies against free-trade agreements and has ties to both industry and organized labor, is provoking conservatives' innate distrust of the GOP establishment by noting that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's promise to return the Senate to ""regular order"" conflicts with the rush and lack of transparency involved in passing trade deals via fast track. ""McConnell said, 'I'm bringing back regular order,' but in this case it's suspending regular order, passing something with no amendments before you even know what's coming from the smoky back room in the other branch--it's procedurally far worse,"" says Michael Stumo, the organization's CEO. He predicts that the trade deals are in more trouble on the right than GOP leaders and the Obama administration think. ""This is a real street fight,"" Stumo said. ""They've granted [Obama] a massive amount of authority and don't want to grant him more."""

Growing up in an immigrant household, I'd felt largely immune to class distinctions. Before high school, some of the kids I knew were somewhat worse off, and others were somewhat better off than most, but we generally all fell into the same lower-middle- or middle-middle-class milieu. So high school was a revelation. Status distinctions that had been entirely obscure to me came into focus. Everything about you--the clothes you wore, the music you listened to, the way you pronounced things--turned out to be a clear marker of where you were from and whether you were worth knowing. By the time I made it to a selective college, I found myself entirely surrounded by this upper-middle-class tribe. My fellow students and my professors were overwhelmingly drawn from comfortably affluent families hailing from an almost laughably small number of comfortably affluent neighborhoods, mostly in and around big coastal cities. Though virtually all of these polite, well-groomed people were politically liberal, I sensed that their gut political instincts were all about protecting what they had and scratching out the eyeballs of anyone who dared to suggest taking it away from them. I can't say I liked these people as a group. Yet without really reflecting on it, I felt that it was inevitable that I would live among them, and that's pretty much exactly what's happened. So allow me to unburden myself. I've had a lot of time to observe and think about the upper middle class, and though many of the upper-middle-class individuals I've come to know are good, decent people, I've come to the conclusion that upper-middle-class Americans threaten to destroy everything that is best in our country. And I want them to stop. Who counts as upper middle class? It depends. Back in 2013, one survey found that 85 percent of Americans saw themselves as part of a broad middle class, stretching from lower middle (26 percent) to middle middle (46 percent) to upper middle (12 percent). We could define it by income--say, all single adults who earn more than $100,000 a year, or all married couples that earn more than $200,000--but that's too crude. Let's just say that upper-middle-class status is a state of mind. We're talking about families that earn well into the six-figure range yet don't feel rich, either because of their student loan debt or the enormous cost of the amenities they consider nonnegotiable: living in well-above-average school districts for those with children or living in ""cool"" neighborhoods for those without. We often hear about the political muscle of the ultrarich. Billionaires like the libertarians Charles and David Koch and Tom Steyer, the California environmentalist who's been waging a one-man jihad against the Keystone XL pipeline, have become bogeymen for the left and right respectively. The influence of these machers is considerable, no doubt. Yet the upper middle class collectively wields far more influence. These are households with enough money to make modest political contributions, enough time to email their elected officials and to sign petitions, and enough influence to sway their neighbors. Upper-middle-class Americans vote at substantially higher rates than those less well-off, and though their turnout levels aren't quite as high as those even richer than they are, there are far more upper-middle-class people than there are rich people. One can easily turn the Kochs or the Steyers of the world into a big fat political target. It's harder to do the same to the lawyers, doctors, and management consultants who populate the tonier precincts of our cities and suburbs. Another thing that separates the upper middle class from the truly wealthy is that even though they're comfortable, they're less able to take the threat of tax increases or benefit cuts in stride. Take away the mortgage interest deduction from a Koch brother and he'll barely notice. Take it away from a two-earner couple living in an expensive suburb and you'll have a fight on your hands. So the upper middle class often uses its political muscle to foil the fondest wishes of egalitarian liberals. This week offered a particularly vivid reminder of how that works. In the windup to his State of the Union address, Barack Obama released a proposal to curb the tax benefits associated with 529 college savings plans, which primarily benefit upper-middle-class families, to help finance the expansion of a separate tax credit that would primarily benefit lower-middle- and middle-middle-class families. Only 3 percent of households actually make use of these accounts, and 70 percent of the tax benefits go to households earning more than $200,000, so you can see why Obama might have thought no one would get too worked up about the proposal. If anything, he might have thought, and hoped, that his critics would get more exercised about his call for big capital gains tax increases, which would have allowed him to play the part of Robin Hood--a role Obama loves to play. That's not quite how things turned out. From the get-go, the 529 plan, like the capital gains tax-hike plan, was totally politically unrealistic, as Republicans in Congress were never going to sign on. But within days of the State of the Union, the Obama administration was forced to reverse course and abandon its plan to make 529 plans less generous. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who represents San Francisco, and House Budget Committee ranking Democrat Chris Van Hollen, who represents the wealthy Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C., were the key drivers of the decision, according to a report by Rachael Bade and Allie Grasgreen in Politico. My guess is that both Pelosi and Van Hollen saw firsthand the fury of upper-middle-income voters who sensed that Obama, normally a paragon of upper-middle-class virtues, was daring to mess with one of their precious tax breaks. Paul Waldman, writing for the Washington Post, had it right when he observed that ""the 529 proposal was targeted at what may be the single most dangerous constituency to anger: the upper middle class."" Many smart people--the libertarian Peter Suderman of Reason, the neoliberal Josh Barro of the New York Times, and conservative Patrick Brennan of National Review, among others--have made the point that if Obama and his allies can't even tweak the tax treatment of this tiny little savings plan, they sure as hell can't succeed in raising other taxes enough to finance entitlement spending as the baby boomers retire in ever-larger numbers in the decades to come, let alone expand social services and public investment with an eye toward making the United States just a bit more Scandinavian. To conservatives, myself included, this is not in itself a bad thing. European social democracies finance their generous welfare states through high consumption taxes that virtually everyone pays. In America, a cross-party consensus that middle-income, including upper-middle-income, households should pay low taxes necessarily limits the growth of government. This is why Obama's plan to bring back the Clinton-era tax rates for households earning more than $250,000 was abandoned for a higher figure of $450,000 shortly after his re-election. Democratic lawmakers like Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer were terrified of angering voters who earned more than $250,000 and who insisted, despite all evidence to the contrary, that they were merely middle class, and who would have skinned them alive had they not been shielded from higher taxes. You might be wondering why I'm so down on the upper middle class when they're getting in the way of the tax hikes that will make big government even bigger. Doesn't that mean that while liberals should be bothered by the power of the upper middle class, conservatives should cheer them on? Well, part of my objection is that upper-middle-income voters only oppose tax hikes on themselves. They are generally fine with raising taxes on people richer than themselves, including taxes on the investments that rich people make in new products, services, and businesses. I find that both annoyingly self-serving and destructive. The bigger reason, however, is that upper-middle-class people don't just use their political muscle to keep their taxes low. They also use it to make life more expensive for everyone else. Take a seemingly small example--occupational licensing. In North Carolina, teeth-whiteners without expensive dental degrees would like to be allowed to sell their services but are opposed by the state's dentists, as Eduardo Porter noted in a recent New York Times column. Are the good dentists of North Carolina fighting the teeth-whiteners because they fear for the dental health of North Carolinians? It doesn't look like it. A more plausible story is that dentists don't want to compete with cut-rate practitioners, because restricting entry into the field allows them to charge higher prices. We often hear about how awesome it is that Uber is making taxi service cheaper and more accessible for ordinary consumers but how sad it is that they are making life harder for working-class drivers who drive traditional cabs. Notice that upper-middle-class credentialed professionals like dentists, lawyers, and doctors rarely get Uber'd to the same degree. Even when innovative services try to do things like, say, offer a free alternative to expensive insurance brokers, state and local governments will often step in to say, ""Oh, no you don't."" Want to offer a low-cost, high-quality education by, say, replacing expensive professors with Filipino instructors who teach calculus over streaming video? Sorry, pal, you first have to get approved by an accreditation body controlled ... by the existing schools you're trying to out-compete, which employ upper-middle-class people who don't take any crap. Or take immigration policy: Dean Baker of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research has called for increasing the number of doctors, dentists, and other professionals allowed into the U.S. while limiting the number of less-skilled people, like would-be retail clerks, custodians, and housekeepers. The reason is that high-skilled immigrants squeeze the wages of upper-middle-class professionals, who can afford to take a hit while lowering the cost of various services for poorer people by giving them the option of going to cheaper doctors and dentists. By contrast, bringing in retail clerks, custodians, and housekeepers makes life cheaper for the upper-middle-class professionals while squeezing the wages of working people, particularly immigrants who already live in the U.S. Want to guess how popular the idea of increasing the wages of nannies is with the upper-middle-class people who employ them? I'd love to know, but I'm sorry to report that upper-middle-class pollsters have yet to ask the question. You'd almost get the impression that while working- and lower-middle-class people are expected to compete, whether with the Ubers of the world or with Chinese manufacturing workers or with immigrants with modest skills, members of the upper middle class ought to be immune. The result is that all Americans have to pay more to get their teeth whitened, to get a formal education, or to do any of the other million things that we can only get through licensed providers. Even more egregious is the way that upper-middle-class NIMBY-ism pushes for strict land-use restrictions that drive working- and lower-middle-class people out of the country's most desirable and productive cities, as Timothy B. Lee of Vox reminds us. We see this most vividly in affluent suburbs, where the local public schools are just as exclusive as elite private schools, and where high home prices do the work of high private school tuitions. Sometimes exclusivity is justified on other grounds. The UCLA economist Matthew Kahn has found that in California, at least, it is liberal cities that have the most stringent zoning regulations. It seems that upper-middle-class California liberals use their supposed environmentalism to justify policies that wind up excluding the less well-off, despite the enormous environmental benefits that would flow from allowing more people to live in coastal California communities. Closer to my home in New York, I've found that upper-middle-class people are the chief culprits behind the gentrification wave that is driving many poor families out of close-in neighborhoods in Brooklyn, my hometown. Stephen Smith has done an excellent job of explaining the dynamic. Most affluent people would be just fine with living in condos in Manhattan if they could afford to do so. But rich Manhattanites fight new development with every fiber of their being, which forces slightly less rich people to move to Brooklyn. Here is where things get interesting. Early on, as gentrification first takes root, these new upper-middle-class arrivals root for development, particularly when it means things like a new Whole Foods and other amenities that make their neighborhoods seem less ""sketchy."" Once they have their fancy grocery stores and their Pilates studios and whatever else it is that floats their boat, however, they sharply shift toward absolutely hating new development, as new development means having to share their new amenities with more newcomers. These new restrictions on supply mean that homeowners who arrived at the right time, before the drawbridge was raised, see their homes get more and more valuable. Landlords can charge higher and higher rents.* The neighborhood gets less and less ""sketchy,"" which is to say less diverse and less inclusive. How convenient. What can we do to break the stranglehold of the upper middle class? I have no idea. Having spent so much time around upper-middle-class Americans, and having entered their ranks in my own ambivalent way, I've come to understand their power. The upper middle class controls the media we consume. They run our big bureaucracies, our universities, and our hospitals. Their voices drown out those of other people at almost every turn. I fear that the only way we can check the tendency of upper-middle-class people to look out for their own interests at the expense of others is to make them feel at least a little guilty about it. It's not much, but it's a start. *Correction, Jan. 31, 2015: The article originally misstated that homeowners who arrived before the drawbridge was lowered see their homes grow in value. The gentrifying homeowners raise the metaphorical drawbridge to keep their neighborhoods exclusive. (Return.)"	Forget the Rich. It's the Upper Middle Class That Is Ruining America.

7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/blaise_ingoglia_is_chairman_of_florida_s_republican_party_the_former_professional.html	"Blaise Ingoglia is a minor YouTube celebrity, a minor real estate mogul, a motivational speaker, and a tournament poker player. He's also in charge of keeping Hillary Clinton from winning Florida. Ingoglia recently became chairman of Florida Republican Party--no small gig, given the state's major implications for the 2016 presidential election--and things are already complicated. His win was a big surprise to many Florida political observers. On Jan. 17, he beat Leslie Dougher, the incumbent Republican Party chairwoman, who had the full-throated backing of newly (and narrowly) re-elected Gov. Rick Scott. Ingoglia also beat a Democrat in November to win a seat in the state House of Representatives, and he'd been party vice chairman since 2011. His win as chairman has precipitated a bit of a Tallahassee foofaraw: The committee responsible for getting Republicans elected to the state Senate ""yanked $800,000 out of the state party as soon as Ingoglia won,"" reported the Tampa Bay Times' Adam C. Smith, and one of his first moves as chairman was to put the rest of the party's finances on lockdown, ""[t]reating the party's 'George Bush Republican Center' like a potential crime scene."" A few Florida political observers said they expect Gov. Scott to stop fundraising for the state party. Some are interpreting Ingoglia's victory as a win for the state's grassroots activists, who will have more clout and be in a better position to force the party to the right. ""It's kind of a course correction to push the Republican Party a little bit more towards the conservative roots,"" said Steve Precourt, former Florida House majority leader. But that's not undisputed. One longtime Florida observer said Ingoglia is loosely in Sen. Marco Rubio's orbit. Peter Schorsch reported at SaintPetersBlog that Richard Corcoran, the next speaker of the House, ""worked furiously behind the scenes to line up votes for his House colleague [Ingoglia], who already gravitated in Corcoran's political orbit."" Corcoran was Rubio's chief of staff during his time as Florida speaker of the House. One source said Ingoglia's ascent is likely a bigger win for Rubio than for grassroots activists. That's not to suggest their interests are in conflict, the source added, but just to point out that Ingoglia's ascent shouldn't necessarily be seen as another chapter in the grassroots vs. establishment narrative. But this isn't just a local story. The success of the Florida Republican Party has major national implications. Florida just passed New York to become the third-most-populous state, and since 1996, the presidential candidate who's won Florida has also won the White House. And though the state's demographics look increasingly favorable to Democrats, Republicans hold every nonfederal statewide office, and control both chambers of the state legislature. So the Florida Republican Party punches above its weight, and its ability to keep on doing so is vital for the success of the national Republican Party. Enter Blaise Ingoglia. Heading up the Florida Republican Party is one of the less interesting parts of his resume. You might know him from the World Poker Tour, where he won more than $300,000 from 2005 to 2007. One of his rivals for party chairman tipped off the Tampa Bay Times to this video of him playing in a World Poker Tour game and sporting an unfortunate greenish-brown button-down and a gold necklace. ""I can assure you my wardrobe has gotten a lot better,"" he told the paper. You also might know him from Donald Trump's 2007 Real Estate and Wealth Expo in Los Angeles. That's where, according to the Tampa Bay Times' Dan DeWitt, the future GOP power broker pitched attendees on get-rich-quick real estate investment strategies that cost some people a lot of money. But you're most likely to have encountered Ingoglia through one of his Government Gone Wild! viral videos, where he offered a different pitch on wealth creation. ""We are now at the point where the best investment isn't gold, it's not the stock market,"" he said in a 2011 video called ""Land of The Freebies, Home of the Enslaved."" ""It's being poor. For every $1 in taxes the lowest-income families pay, they will receive an average of $10 back in federal spending benefits, a tenfold return."" That video has more than 1.1 million views. Another, called ""Brother, Can You Spare a Trillion?,"" has 5.2 million and was one of the five most watched political videos on YouTube in 2011. His rhetoric is showy and dramatic. He traveled the state giving Government Gone Wild! seminars that touched on the same themes as his videos, and wrote in an April 2012 column that Obama's re-election would be ""the end of America as we know it."" He also stirred a brief controversy in 2008 when he said that Obama's face would be on food stamps instead of dollar bills. He later defended the comment from criticisms that it was racially insensitive. ""Race had nothing to do with that joke,"" he said, per the Tampa Bay Times. ""I'm offended somebody would think it was a racial comment."" None of this has hindered his rapid ascent to the top of the Florida Republican Party. Indeed, a number of the Republicans I spoke with offered unqualified praise for the poker player-turned-Grand Old Party animal. Will Weatherford, former speaker of the House who's often listed as a potential Senate candidate if Rubio's seat opens up, said he's happy about Ingoglia's new role. ""He's got a high motor,"" said Weatherford. ""He's very good on his feet."" Ingoglia has plenty of fans outside Tallahassee, too. Radio host Burnie Thompson said he thinks Ingoglia's win means activists will have more say in the party's direction. ""He's a very compelling guy,"" Thompson said. ""When you talk to him, he just is very, very convincing."" Whether he can convince Florida to vote for a Republican presidential candidate for the first time since 2004 is still an open question."

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/hillary_clinton_needs_to_campaign_in_iowa_she_needs_to_hone_her_message.html	"DES MOINES, Iowa--Covering the frantic Republican caucus in Iowa while simultaneously covering the drowsy Democratic contest is like stepping off of a moving walkway. You swing your arms and legs at the same quick pace, but you're not moving fast anymore. The Republican candidates are scrambling for organizers, planning visits, and zooming around the country collecting money, while Hillary Clinton is the most dominant nonincumbent ever. Democrats like Gov. Martin O'Malley and Sen. Bernie Sanders are making moves, but few local activists even pretend that they are serious challengers to Clinton. Ready for Hillary is in the state and organizing all 99 counties, but all of that activity without any real competition is the difference between running in place and running for your life. Nevertheless, there is a feeling in Iowa that Clinton needs to campaign as if she had a real challenger. A pause for an important Iowa caveat: Not all the advice coming out of Iowa is driven by what's best for Hillary Clinton. Activists in the state like to be courted and are used to getting attention. They like the phone calls they can dine out on. They like it when the candidate visits the state because they can raise money off the visit and build their local political networks. So it's not surprising that Iowa Democratic activists want Clinton in the state early and often. That's one reason why Clinton might be tempted to ignore the advice coming out of the state to make a big commitment. The other is that she has a lot of commitments all across the country. She's got to raise money, and there are perhaps easier places where she can campaign to tighten her message and buff her image. After all, Iowa has the bad memories of the 2008 race, where Barack Obama beat her, and it's not like she is in danger of losing the caucus. But the best argument for a strong Clinton campaign in Iowa isn't based on her being in danger of losing the caucus. The argument for Clinton to play hard in Iowa is rooted in the general election to come. In my time in Iowa, a few Democrats compared Clinton to Bruce Braley, the failed Democratic Senate candidate. The consensus view is that Braley waited too long to present himself, and as a result he was defined by his opponent. Also, as a campaigner, he lacked the ability to make a strong connection with voters. In short, he was late and out of touch. The comparison isn't entirely fair. Clinton is a better candidate than Braley, but those general critiques are familiar ones that attach to her. Of course, there are benefits to waiting as long as possible before launching a campaign. A late start diminishes the chance for stumbles and the onset of Clinton fatigue in the electorate. The counterargument is that Clinton needs a sparring partner. She was a better candidate in 2008 after Barack Obama toughened her up. Even those who have her self-interest at heart think that she would benefit from having an opponent. ""She would be a much better candidate if she had a challenger,"" said one veteran Democratic politician. ""It would sharpen her ideas and help her reaction time."" (Since the Democratic field looks so weak at the moment, perhaps a wealthy donor should step in and hire a populist bruiser.) Plus, Republicans are already running against her like she's an announced candidate anyway. Why let them define her first? The second reason to run hard is that Iowa is a general-election battleground state. If Clinton looks like she's willing to fight for the vote now and give Iowans the attention that they have come to expect, they will remember that when she's fighting for those six electoral votes. Finally, Iowa is well-designed for the precise kind of personal campaigning Clinton needs to do. The knocks against Clinton are that she thinks she's owed the presidency and that she has no message other than her inevitability. If she campaigned hard in Iowa, it would show that despite her Olympian position in the polls, she's willing to fight hard and take no vote for granted. She has grit and isn't going to duck a state that has been unkind to her in the past, even though that would be easy for her. ""It would show people that she was willing to earn it,"" says a veteran Democratic strategist who isn't based in Iowa. At the moment, Clinton's image conjures visions of wealth and black SUVs. The frequent fundraising trips she will take will add photos and datelines like New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco to this storyline. If the general election turns on a conversation about which candidate cares most about the life of the regular voter and the challenges he faces, Clinton needs to show she can participate in that conversation. There's no better place than a house in Dubuque, Iowa. ""When she comes to Iowa she can sit in someone's living room and talk about her vision for the country,"" says Bonnie Campbell, former Iowa Attorney General and a former Democratic gubernatorial candidate. ""When people see her personality, they change their mind about her. The more practice she can get, the better."""	Why Hillary Clinton Needs to Fight Hard for Iowa	['Sanders', 'Clinton', 'Obama']	[]
9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/history_of_the_pocket_constitution_these_miniature_versions_of_america_s.html	"Protesters waving pocket constitutions were escorted out of a Donald Trump rally on Thursday. The constitutions were a nod to Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim-American soldier killed in Iraq, who challenged Donald Trump to read the Constitution in an impassioned speech at the Democratic National Convention. In 2015, Betsy Woodruff wrote on the history of the pocket Constitution. Forget apple pie. Forget the Statue of Liberty, Chuck Norris, Daisy Dukes, cowboy boots, and hot dogs on the Fourth of July. The most American thing that has ever existed landed on my desk a few weeks ago in an unsolicited mailing from a libertarian-leaning think tank: a snappy new Cato Institute pocket Constitution, one of millions printed since the booklets first started streaming off printing presses decades ago. Conservative activists' sometimes-histrionic devotion to the text of the Constitution might suggest that the document's most animated defenders live on the right end of the political spectrum. The Tea Party's ascendance in recent years did bring a renewed interest in some of the nation's founding documents like the Federalist Papers, the Declaration of Independence, and--naturally--the Constitution. And with that came a steep uptick in demand for the slim, often burgundy volumes. Thus, the tiny booklets are often associated with unflattering stereotypes of angry, unlettered grassroots conservatives who sport tri-corner hats and wave signs calling on House Speaker John Boehner to ""Try Growen' a Pair!!"" But the rise of pocket Constitutions isn't an arcane outgrowth from some right-wing conservative phenomenon. Indeed, these miniaturized versions of our founding charter are neither new nor a conservative creation. The history of the pocket Constitution is a notably non-ideological one, as is the controversy that these documents have sometimes engendered. It's not entirely clear--at least to your amateur historian--where the story of the pocket Constitution begins. The earliest date I could find was 1965. The Congressional Record shows resolutions to print copies of the Constitution in 1962, 1963, and 1964. But there's no reference to the documents' size. On May 10, 1965, however, there's a resolution from ""Mr. Hays, from the House Committee on Administration"" calling for the printing of a ""pocket-sized edition"" of the Constitution. The estimated cost was $2,811. The resolution didn't offer a rationale for why a smaller-sized Constitution was suddenly necessary or how many copies could be printed for that precise sum, but it appears to have been the handiwork of an Ohio Democrat named Wayne Hays. Rep. Hays chaired the House Committee on House Administration, and is remembered mainly for resigning from his perch as chair--and then from Congress altogether--after news broke that he had an affair with the committee's secretary and kept her on staff even though she said she couldn't type, file, or answer the telephone. But though Hays' dalliances may have curtailed his congressional career, they shouldn't overshadow what looks like his lasting contribution to American political culture: getting Congress to print the first fun-size copies of the Constitution. And that printing came none too soon. Before the Tea Party rallied against perceived government corruption and abuse, there was Watergate. Susan Herman, president of the ACLU, said the first instance she knows of when prominent politicians used pocket Constitutions for effect was during the Watergate hearings. Sen. Sam Ervin, a North Carolina Democrat, chaired the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Campaign Practices--also known as the Watergate Committee (or even the Ervin Committee)--and the hearings were televised. Ervin used to pull out his pocket copy of the Constitution during the hearings, and it made a powerful visual impact. ""That was really important, because Watergate was so much a moment of paying attention to the Constitution,"" Herman said. ""The fact that there was this visual and personal symbol of somebody who was paying very careful attention to exactly what the Constitution said I think was really important in the history of the Watergate hearings."" Pocket Constitutions are the perfect prop because they're easy to tote around and whip out of your pocket to make a point. Pound for pound, you won't do much better. Nobody was more aware of that than Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd. One long-time Senate staffer told me that in his later days, the West Virginian senator would roll around the Capitol Building in his wheelchair hollering ""Make way for liberty!"" while waving his pocket Constitution in the air. Byrd and Michigan Democratic Sen. Carl Levin had their constitutions handy for a photo-op in 1998 when the Supreme Court struck down the president's line-item veto. The executive power had been granted to President Clinton in 1996 in an effort to curb reckless spending, which is a Tea Party-friendly goal if there's ever been one. But Congress' most famous pocket Constitution fan wasn't having it. At a press conference after the decision, according to Ray Smock at the Robert C. Byrd Center for Legislative Studies, Byrd cried, ""God save this honorable court!"" as he hoisted his personal copy over his head. When I asked Sen. Joe Manchin, the junior senator from West Virginia, if he carried one, he whipped it out of his coat pocket and waved it at me. Rep. Kristi Noem, a South Dakota Republican, says she prefers to keep hers in her purse. ""A lot of folks will give them to you as you're traveling around the state of South Dakota,"" she said. ""I've had quite a few handed to me over the last several months."" Its ubiquitousness is probably explained, in part, by its strong bipartisan support. The ACLU prints them en masse, as well as the conservative Heritage Foundation and the libertarian Cato Institute. When it comes to constitutional interpretation, these groups often have substantial and sometimes ugly disagreements. But they all believe the Constitution is on their side. It's the same with many of the members and top political leaders who carry the little booklets. David Addington was Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff for three years, an influential legal mind in the Bush administration, and a devoted supporter of the NSA's warrantless wiretapping program. PBS called him ""Cheney's powerful, one-man legal office,"" and noted that the pair worked closely to consolidate the president's power. The New Yorker cited an anonymous source who claimed that Secretary of State Colin Powell once said Addington ""doesn't care about the Constitution."" Maybe, but he carried one. In Days of Fire, journalist Peter Baker wrote that the controversial lawyer always had one on his person. It may be the only thing Addington shares with the ACLU--and Dennis Kucinich. Kucinich, a former Ohio Democratic congressman and ill-fated presidential candidate, never left his Constitution at home either. In a 2007 Democratic presidential primary debate, Brian Williams asked the candidates if they backed Kucinich's efforts to impeach Addington's boss, Dick Cheney. None did. ""Is this a proper use of congressional time and energy?"" Williams asked Kucinich. The congressman reached for his pocket Constitution and tore into Cheney and President Bush's decision to go to war in Iraq. ""Now, we have to stand for this Constitution, we have to protect and defend this Constitution,"" he said. ""And this vice president has violated this Constitution."" The pocket Constitution's mass production--and the devotion it inspires on left and right--is reminiscent of the treatment that another widely distributed book gets: the Bible. Members of the Gideons have been handing out the volumes for more than a century. There's a shared sola scriptura ethic between the Gideons and the political groups that disburse little Constitutions: The basic premise seems to be that a text that's complicated, controversial, and historically fraught can be accessible and useful to people who don't have any advanced theological or legal training. That sentiment is as populist as they come. The Tea Party's devotion to the Constitution recalls early Protestants' devotion to Scripture. William Tyndale, who translated the Bible into English, once told a scornful clergyman, ""If God spare my life, ere many years pass, I will cause a boy that driveth the plow shall know more of the Scripture than thou dost."" Sounds familiar. But sometimes devotion to the Constitution is self-defeating. Roger Pilon, who directs the Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies and helped launch its program of printing and distributing pocket Constitutions, said he admired Byrd's devotion to the product. But there was one hiccup. The West Virginian pushed for the passage of a law that required all federally-funded schools to hold events marking Constitution Day on Sept. 17. ""Here's the irony: There is no constitutional authority for Congress doing that,"" said Pilon, laughing. ""Robert Byrd may have been the constitutional conscience of the Congress, but he didn't really understand it."" Like those tiny New Testaments, pocket Constitutions don't come with catechisms. They can symbolize just about whatever their bearers want. But just like there are plenty of Christians who don't pass out copies of pocket-sized Gideons New Testaments, there are plenty of members of Congress who don't see an advantage in carrying the text of the Constitution with them everywhere they go. Former Rep. Henry Waxman, a California Democrat, was one of them. ""I've never felt the need to carry around anything,"" he said. ""I have a pretty good recollection of most of what's in the Constitution, and if I didn't have clarity about a certain provision, I could Google it on my iPhone."" He headed off, and then abruptly wheeled around. ""Oh, by the way, I do have the Ten Commandments!"""

But that was then. For 2016, the pioneers of that kind of politics--conservative billionaires Charles G. and David H. Koch--have found a new summit. According to the New York Times, the siblings plan to spend close to $900 million on next year's campaign, with incursions into the Republican presidential primary. At more than double the roughly $400 million the Koch brothers spent in 2012, this money would go to polling, analytics, advertising, grassroots campaigns, single-issue advocacy groups, and more. For comparison's sake, in the last presidential election, the Republican National Committee--along with the National Republican Congressional Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee--spent a total of $657 million. It's Democratic counterparts, likewise, spent a total of $647 million. The committees spent somewhat smaller amounts in the 2008 election and are likely to spend similarly larger amounts next year. In its description of the Koch creation, the Times notes that it involves roughly 300 other donors and ""includes groups like Freedom Partners, a trade organization overseen by Koch advisers that plans the retreat and helps corral contributions; Americans for Prosperity, a national grassroots group; and Concerned Veterans for America, which organizes conservative veterans."" Another way to put this is that the organization is something of a joint effort on behalf of the kinds of people who already participate in Republican politics. In the same way that a person who collects 100 votes is more valuable to the party than someone who just votes, these donors and activists strengthen their position by operating under a single umbrella. Specifically, they make themselves a powerful force in the fight to pick a presidential nominee. For the candidate, a huge part of running for president is building consensus. To have a chance at winning, you need to at least satisfy the constituent groups of the party, and in particular, those groups with the greatest resources. In practice, this means that the traditional factions of the Republican Party--Wall Street managers, longtime regulars, elected leaders, political pundits, and assorted business people--hold a lot of sway over the outcome. Challenge the interests of bankers, and you might have to find new donors for your campaign. Attack military interventions, and you might miss an important endorsement from a prominent magazine. In 2016, you can add another step to this dance: Cross the Koch brothers--on climate change or economic regulations or any of their other pet issues--and you risk losing an important source for help and money. Indeed, there's a chance this Koch organization will stand as an institutional base (a counter-establishment of sorts) for a viable candidate who doesn't have general appeal or is competing with other candidates in the same position. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has broad appeal within the Republican Party. An evangelical Christian, he defeated public-sector unions in a fight over collective bargaining, survived a recall pushed by his opponents, and won re-election while pushing conservative reforms in a liberal state. He excites the kinds of party activists who dominate primaries and caucuses but has the polished appearance of a traditional nominee. His main problem is that there are other candidates who satisfy key concerns for large parts of the party and who also bring substantial financial backing. When you can have a familiar name like Jeb Bush or are a quasi-icon like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, why would you go for Walker? But the huge presence of David and Charles Koch changes that calculation. They give Walker better ground to stand on. He can run an insurgent campaign, and unlike Mike Huckabee in the 2008 race, he won't run out of cash. Suddenly, there's a real alternative to the original consensus candidate, and the two are forced into serious competition, which can reveal hidden strength or highlight unnoticed weakness. And if Walker loses the nomination, then at least the Kochs have made themselves an even stronger force in Republican politics--a fourth leg to the GOP coalition. For liberal observers, there's a certain irony to these moves and machinations. In Democratic politics, the Koch brothers are real-life bogeymen, avatars of rapacious greed and a dangerous threat to our public institutions. But in Republican politics, the Koch brothers may become a new tool for accountability: a way for less powerful parts of the party to ignore the usual gatekeepers and exert their will. And if we see something different from the Kochs in the next year, then this is still a fascinating development in American politics, if not an entirely unprecedented one. In the industrializing America of the late 19th century, business leaders spent huge sums to keep politicians from regulating industry and taming their activities. If this marriage of extreme wealth and mass politics was the norm for the first Gilded Age, then there's no reason it should be different for the second one."

""And when they're released they have to start from scratch all over again and figure out another way to be self-sufficient and to take care of themselves and their families."" It's an important point. The terrifying reality of stop-and-frisk wasn't just the risk of violence or humiliating treatment--it was the chance that a police stop could upend your life. ""They arrest you and build up all these little, petty things ... and after a certain time, now OK, you have three of these, it's a felony,"" explained another interviewee. ""When you put a felony on somebody you're telling a person basically you're just a hard-core criminal. You can't get [a] job. If you want to work in a bank, well you can forget that."" For many Americans, an arrest for marijuana possession--a minor crime that isn't even punished in parts of the country (read: college campuses)--can ruin your life In New York, stop-and-frisk wasn't just a criminal justice issue--a question of equal treatment under the law--it was an economic one, too. Which is why then-candidate Bill de Blasio found success with his message of economic equality and criminal justice reform. For him and his supporters, they were two sides of the same coin. All of this is apropos a recent column in the New York Times from Noam Scheiber, a liberal writer and former editor at the New Republic. Pointing to the mayor's middling approval ratings--49 percent, according to the latest survey from Quinnipiac--and in particular his flagging support from the city's whites, Scheiber argues that de Blasio has misstepped in his focus on stop-and-frisk and the city's police. Specifically, Scheiber sees de Blasio as abandoning a key strand of his campaign that could have bolstered his standing with the city as a whole, instead of dividing it along racial lines:"	Why de Blasio Was Right to Take On Criminal Justice Reform	[]	[]
12	12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/senate_keystone_votes_republicans_gave_democrats_and_the_climate_an_even.html	"Since the Senate began debate on fast-tracking the Keystone XL pipeline earlier this month, things have gone from bad to worse to downright miserable for anyone who believes in the reality of man-made climate change. President Obama has promised to veto the Keystone legislation once it arrives at his desk, so the political maneuvering on the floor, not unlike the bill itself, is largely symbolic. But messages matter in this fight--particularly ahead of this year's U.N. climate conference in Paris, where the president will have to convince the rest of the world that the United States is serious about combatting global warming. That was always going to be a tough sales pitch with the GOP forcing the Keystone issue at home, but what happened in the Senate last week will make it all the more difficult. The upper chamber voted not once, but four separate times to reject amendments acknowledging that humans are contributing to climate change. Bonne chance in France, Mr. President! Adding insult to considerable injury for the climate crowd was how the whole thing played out. Heading into the floor debate, there was a popular line of thinking in Washington that Democrats could scratch out a handful of small but significant political points by shaming Republicans over their unscientific opinions about climate science. The problem with that logic, as last week made painfully clear, is that it's all but impossible to embarrass someone about something they're publicly proud of. Even the Democrats' small political victories look a whole lot more like large, soul-crushing defeats. For proof, look no farther than the chief target of Democrats' shame game: James Inhofe, the Senate's most vocal denier of climate science and, not incidentally, the new chairman of the powerful Environment and Public Works Committee. In a not-so-veiled dig at the 2012 book Inhofe wrote about his climate views--title: The Greatest Hoax--Democrats offered an amendment to the Keystone bill that declared simply, ""Climate change is real and not a hoax."" Not only did Inhofe vote in favor of the amendment, he even signed on as a co-sponsor. ""Climate is changing, and climate has always changed,"" the Oklahoma Republican said, alluding to the bible. ""The hoax is that there are some people who are so arrogant to think that they are so powerful they can change climate. Man can't change climate."" The amendment passed 98 to 1, handing Democrats a victory so empty that it was an embarrassment even without the climate science-rejecting votes that followed, in which the Democrats put up a trio of amendments that declared man-made climate change to be real and devastating, to which Republicans, to varying degrees, said no. Making matters worse still on a global scale was a separate resolution, penned by Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt and co-sponsored by Inhofe, that took direct aim at the historic climate deal that the United States and China struck this past November, an agreement seen as a crucial precursor to a larger international deal. The Blunt amendment garnered 51 votes, less than the 60 it needed but more than enough to remind U.N. negotiators why they'll have to aim for a nonbinding climate agreement and not a binding treaty that the Senate would need to ratify. The Senate opposition to an international deal--with China in specific or the world at large--is hardly a surprise; since the institution is now on record that it doesn't think man is contributing to climate change, it has little reason to act to slow it. (Also: Saubhagya in India this week, Mr. President!) Senate Republicans are on pace to send the underlying Keystone bill to the president's desk later this week. While Obama's veto will soothe liberals' wounds, it won't repair all of the damage inflicted by Republicans this month. The president also appears unwilling to do everything he can to help: To date he's been careful to make his opposition about the process of Congress approving the pipeline, not to the pipeline itself. If the president keeps taking bureaucratic cover, he'll miss a golden opportunity for a climate victory of his own. Climate advocates willing to squint can find a silver lining in the president's veto and in the individual vote tallies for the failed climate science amendments. Five GOP senators--Lindsey Graham, Susan Collins, Lamar Alexander, Kelly Ayotte, and Mark Kirk--voted for an amendment that declared ""human activity contributes significantly to climate change,"" and another ten--including Rand Paul--were willing to do so for a second, watered-down version authored by Republicans that said the same thing minus the word significantly. There wasn't enough bipartisan support for either amendment to reach the 60 votes needed for approval, but it was promising news nonetheless, particularly paired with recent comments from Republican presidential hopefuls outside of the Senate acknowledging the reality of climate change. Still, those developments can only be viewed as long-term progress through a narrow lens. Less than a decade ago--the last time Republicans controlled the Senate--Sen. John McCain was vowing to do everything he could to combat climate change. As David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council pointed out last week, McCain and nine of his Republican colleagues crossed the aisle to vote with Democrats in 2005 on a resolution that acknowledged not only mankind's role in climate change but also called for the government to actually do something about it. Flash-forward to last week: McCain cast a vote for the most watered-down climate amendment--but not the stronger version that included the word significantly--and also backed Blunt's effort to derail the China deal. Democrats hope that putting Senate Republicans on the record now as rejecting climate science will pay political dividends in 2016 and beyond. Climate advocates, meanwhile, must hope that those political victories will then turn into legislative gains in short order. Both of those things may very well happen--but certainly not during the remainder of this GOP-controlled Congress. Republicans are more than willing to keep arguing against the science, since doing so frees them from the responsibility of finding a solution."

13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/wendell_ford_s_greatest_accomplishment_the_former_kentucky_senator_who_defied.html	"Wendell Ford, a Kentucky Democrat who served 24 years in the Senate after three years as governor, died on Thursday at the age of 90 after a battle with lung cancer. On Friday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who served opposite Ford as Kentucky's other senator for 14 years and surpassed him as the state's longest-serving senator in 2009 eulogized him as a ""workhorse of the Senate"" who shaped Kentucky ""in ways few others had before him,"" but ""never forgot the lessons about hard work he learned while milking cows or tending to chores on the family farm."" Left unmentioned was McConnell's long-running clash with his fellow Kentucky senator. In fact, McConnell had tried--and failed--to block what became one of Ford's greatest accomplishments as a senator, the motor voter law of 1993, making it easier for Americans to register to vote. The battle is worth briefly revisiting on the occasion of Ford's passing because it not only speaks to Ford's legacy but also sheds light on the Senate's new majority leader and foreshadows our current era's bitter fight over voting laws. A native of Owensboro who initially went to work alongside his father in the insurance business, Ford was a textbook Kentucky Democrat, better known for his staunch defense of the state's interests--in tobacco, coal, and whiskey--than he was for writing big legislation. But in the early 1990s, he joined with Sen. Mark Hatfield, a moderate Republican from Oregon, to tackle one of America's great civic weaknesses, low voter participation. They drafted the legislation that became known as the motor voter bill, which made it more convenient to vote by instituting automatic sign-up at motor-vehicle registration, as well as allowing voter registration by mail and at a wide array of state and local government offices. It would seem like a difficult measure to oppose. But McConnell, then heading into his second term in the Senate, made it his mission to try to block his fellow Kentuckian's initiative. He argued that the bill was an unfunded mandate that gave the states new responsibilities without paying for them. In a preview of the voting wars to come a decade later, he warned that the bill would open the door to voter fraud. And he admitted, with the impressive candor that he occasionally flashes, that his opposition was not exactly free of personal and partisan motivations. McConnell spoke often in those years about the disadvantage that he and other Republicans were at in Kentucky, where at the time registered Democrats still heavily outnumbered Republicans. (As I note in my new book on McConnell, it was this disadvantage that he initially invoked to justify his opposition to restrictions on campaign spending, arguing that he and other Republicans needed to be able to spend heavily to level the playing field.) In opposing the motor voter bill, McConnell made plain that he believed expanded registration would help Democrats, the party of the teeming masses. He mocked Ford's ""handwringing about low voter-turnout,"" as quoted by John David Dyche in his authorized 2008 biography of McConnell. And he freely admitted that in his mind, low voter participation was not necessarily a bad thing because it meant that elections would be decided by a more rarefied electorate, rather than by the less-informed (Democratic-leaning) hoi polloi. ""It is a sign of the health of our democracy that people feel secure enough about the health of the country and its leaders that people don't have to obsess about politics all the time,"" he said. Or as he put it at another point: ""People vote because they care--and no voter registration requirement will stop them, even if it is slightly burdensome."" It was a classic articulation of the small-R republican model of American government--representative government by the more serious and civic-minded members of society, shielded from the whims of the mob--as opposed to the small-D democratic vision of mass participation. The leader of an advocacy group that formed to oppose motor voter framed this argument very bluntly by deploring that the bill would allow ""unresponsible citizens"" to vote: ""The legislation is a travesty both on the ballot and the intent of our Founders--self-government by a patriotic citizenry; strong, responsible, willing and committed enough to maintain control over state and federal governments. [The bill] would bring into the electoral system millions who are not."" McConnell and his fellow Republicans mustered enough opposition to the bill to block it via filibuster in September 1990. But Ford and his allies kept pushing it, year after year. As they inched closer to a filibuster-proof majority, McConnell's arguments against it became harsher. At a March 1991 hearing, he declared, ""This bill wants to turn every agency, bureau, and office of state government into a vast voter registration machine. Motor voter registration, hunting permit voter registration, marriage license voter registration, welfare voter registration--even drug rehab voter registration."" In March 1993, he attacked Ford for refusing to drop the provision that allowed welfare and unemployment agencies to register voters. By letting social service agencies register voters, he said, the bill ""discriminates against taxpayers in favor of welfare recipients."" It was not hard to miss the signals that McConnell was sending about the bill and who would benefit from it. McConnell tried to weaken or sabotage the bill with clever amendments, including one that would make voter fraud or corrupt acts by officials at any level--federal, state, or local--a federal crime with a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, and one that would have nullified the registration law in any state where it did not increase voter turnout by at least 2 percent. His efforts finally came to naught. The bill passed in May of 1993 and was signed into law by President Clinton. But that didn't stop McConnell.  A year later he introduced an amendment to the reauthorization of the supplemental nutrition program for poor pregnant women and mothers of young children (WIC), seeking to bar the program's offices from offering voter registration. Doing so, he said, was distracting from the program's primary purpose. The amendment failed, and motor voter has since become enshrined as an accepted part of the landscape, a tribute to Ford's persistence. But McConnell's crusade against an overabundance of voting carried on. After the Florida election debacle of 2000, McConnell led the Republican side in crafting the bipartisan election reform law of 2002, and his emphasis in those negotiations was guarding against ""voter fraud,"" which would become his party's watchword for the decade to come. Ford had left the Senate by then, having retired in 1999. But it's not hard to imagine his reaction to McConnell's subsequent efforts to justify his party's push to limit voting. ""If it's not one thing one day,"" Ford said during his battles with McConnell in 1993, ""it's another another day."""

14	14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/republicans_are_discussing_poverty_and_inequality_democrats_should_engage.html	"The economy is growing, a presidential election is on the horizon, and Republicans are finally tackling income inequality as a national problem. Earlier this month former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush launched his new PAC with a message geared toward economic insecurity: ""While the last eight years have been pretty good ones for top earners, they've been a lost decade for the rest of America."" Last Friday former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney talked up inequality, telling a Republican audience in San Diego, ""Under President Obama, the rich have gotten richer, income inequality has gotten worse, and there are more people in poverty than ever before."" For as odd as it is to hear Romney (of ""47 percent"" fame) disdain the plutocratic economy, it's also a welcome change. After 15 years of bad economic news--from sluggish growth and wage stagnation to a world-historical recession--we are finally at a point of real progress. Now is the time to talk frankly about what we need to further our gains and ensure broad prosperity. And, sincere or not, it's good that Republicans want to be part of that conversation. At its best, conservative thinking on inequality puts a laser focus on the particular problems of families. ""Perhaps the most basic challenge facing middle-class families,"" said Utah Sen. Mike Lee in an expansive speech to the Heritage Foundation in October 2013, ""is how expensive it has become for couples to simply start and grow their families."" And while liberals will not agree with Republican prescriptions, there's real value in their critiques and counterproposals. For example, one of the smarter conservative criticisms of President Obama's plan for larger child and child care tax credits is that they penalize stay-at-home parents. Specifically, Obama's plan would give new tax credits to dual-income families as well as provide larger credits to parents who need child care to do paid work. But if a family chooses to forgo market income by having a parent stay home, it loses these credits. Now, this might be the right move. While leaving the market lowers family income, it's also true that it gives certain benefits--free child care--that aren't taxed. The value of those benefits might be equal to the credits available to a two-income family. Which is to say that, in a final accounting, both kinds of families might end up in the same place. Still, for liberals who want to support a variety of family types, this is a serious oversight, and it's good that Republicans are there to highlight the blind spot. Likewise, in engaging the inequality question, there are places where the GOP could stand to rethink its approach. One of the worst features of Republican tax reform on the state level is the reliance on sales and excise taxes to make up for cuts elsewhere. Before he shelved it, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal's tax plan would have phased out state income and corporate taxes and replaced them with higher and broader sales taxes. Likewise, in Kansas, Gov. Sam Brownback has pursued tax reform that does the same. The problem is that this shifts the tax burden from the top to the bottom. In other words, it's upward redistribution of wealth that harms the least well-off. And while the vast majority of states have tax systems that hit low-income Americans the hardest, these effects are worst in conservative states, where the highest tax burdens are on the poorest residents. Of the 10 states with the highest taxes on the poor, according to a recent study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, eight--Florida, Texas, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Arizona, Kansas, and Indiana--have had unified Republican control in the last six years. It's true that many liberal states--like Washington, Maryland, and Massachusetts--have high tax burdens on the poor. But they couple these with generous social services. The same isn't true in conservative states, which combine regressive taxes with sparse benefits, leaving low-income residents with high taxes and little to show for it. None of this causes inequality. But it certainly doesn't help, and it wouldn't be hard for Republicans (and Democrats, too) to either move away from sales taxes or increase benefits for low-income residents to compensate for disproportionate tax burdens. At the least, it needs to be on the radar. Tax systems are statements of our priorities as much as they're ways to raise revenue, and judging from the taxes we impose on the poor, we're not too interested in providing a path out of poverty. If it does anything, a national debate over inequality might bring this particular problem into focus. Indeed, genuine debate might bring a whole host of problems to the forefront: things we've ignored, downplayed, or treated as nonissues. And while Republicans are a little late to the inequality conversation, their growing presence is a sign that action could happen. For liberals who have long engaged these problems, and who are fighting on friendly territory, this is a good thing."

That won't end the partisan bickering over the pipeline, which has been raging for the past six years and counting, but it will largely freeze the fight in place. The GOP lacks the votes it needs for an override, and the State Department is refusing to say when it will make a final recommendation on the project, which is what the president says he's waiting on. Republicans, then, will have done all they can--and Obama all he has to. But with the Keystone fight losing steam, another high-profile energy battle is bubbling back up: the decades-old debate over Nevada's Yucca Mountain, the proposed site of a massive federal repository for America's nuclear waste. The project, which dates back to the Reagan administration, has long been a top priority for the nuclear industry and its Republican allies, but it was more or less left for dead after the 2008 election. Obama promised on the campaign trail that he would block the project and, with the help of then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, the president effectively did just that shortly after he took office. Now that Republicans control both chambers of Congress, however, Yucca appears destined to return to the national stage. Industry officials have said that GOP leaders assured them privately that jump-starting Yucca is one of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's top priorities for this year. And, Rep. John Shimkus, the Illinois Republican who chairs that panel's Environment and Economy Subcommittee, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal last month that he is working on just such a bill that he hopes the House will then vote on this summer. Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and James Inhofe of Oklahoma, both of whom lead key energy-themed committees in the upper chamber, have also suggested nuclear waste is on their agendas. Republicans and Democrats are sure to clash on a whole host of energy issues in a post-Keystone world, but a singular project like Yucca seems poised to draw the type of attention that made Keystone a polarizing staple of stump speeches, fundraising pitches, and attack ads during the past two elections. The two projects are, of course, vastly different. One is a 1,700-mile pipeline that would move tar sands oil from Canada to the Gulf Coast, the other amounts to a high-tech underground garbage dump that would house 77,000 tons of spent nuclear reactor fuel, as well as the detritus that remains from the nation's bomb-building binge during the Cold War. Politically speaking, though, the two projects share more than enough in common for the fight over Yucca to pretty seamlessly pick up where the fight over Keystone left off. Both are individual projects that have become de facto litmus tests in the larger fight over the nation's energy future. Support and opposition both fall largely--but not completely--along party lines. And, most important of all given the existing tensions in the nation's capital, both have been wrapped in bureaucratic red tape by a White House that would prefer to block each project on procedural grounds than on their merits alone. The long-stalled Yucca project began to inch forward again in 2013 when a federal appeals court forced the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to restart the process of evaluating whether the site could safely serve as the nation's nuclear dump, and rebuked the panel for ""flouting the law"" for abandoning its review in 2010. (Then-NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko--a former Reid aide whom Obama appointed to lead the panel--cited a lack of federal funding as the reason the panel pulled the plug on the evaluation. In reality, while Jaczko's old Senate boss had managed to cut future funding for Yucca, the commission still had $11 million left to spend.) The panel has now finished that long-delayed review, releasing the final two volumes of the five-part safety evaluation late last month. The NRC report--not unlike the State Department's preliminary evaluation of Keystone--has proved to be a Rorschach test inside the Beltway, with both sides seeing only what they want. Supporters tout the fact that the panel concluded the design would be capable of safely isolating the high-level radioactive waste for 1 million years as required. (And here I'll pause briefly to channel my former colleague Timothy Noah when I shout in disbelief: One million years is a long time!) Critics, meanwhile, point to another important finding, one that has more to do with the practicality of building Yucca than with its theoretical performance: that the project can't proceed without the government acquiring crucial land and water rights, something that appears all but impossible given Nevada's steadfast opposition to the project. The gridlock, meanwhile, is proving costly. Right now, our nuclear waste is spread out among 70-odd commercial nuclear power plants around the country. Burying the waste deep underground--whether in the Nevada desert or somewhere else--is currently considered the nation's best bet for permanent (or, more accurately, permanent-as-possible) disposal. The Energy Department has been collecting tens of billions of dollars in fees from reactor owners since the 1980s with the promise of taking the spent reactor fuel off their hands. But without Yucca or an alternative in place--or even in the works--courts have assessed billions of dollars in damages against the government for failing to live up to its end of the deal. According to the New York Times, the Energy Department's potential liability is now upward of $20 billion. The Yucca stalemate also serves as a proxy for the larger debate over what role nuclear power will play in America's energy future. The GOP--which it should be noted isn't ready to admit man is a cause of climate change--has called nuclear power ""the most reliable zero-carbon-emissions source of energy that we have."" The climate crowd has a more complicated relationship with nuclear. James Hansen and several other leading climate scientists see it as essential in the fight against global warming, while others in the field point to the long-term unknowns and the shorter-term carbon costs involved in the mining and transportation of uranium, and the construction and operation of reactors. Heavyweight environmental groups like Greenpeace and the Sierra Club, meanwhile, are steadfast in their opposition, arguing that nuclear is too expensive, dangerous, and time-consuming to be worth the effort. For his part, Obama has paid lip service to nuclear power but has done little to spur the nuclear renaissance the industry was dreaming of a decade ago. In his latest budget, the president proposes creating an interim storage site for the nuclear waste at a cost of $5.7 billion over the next decade. In the past, Yucca proponents have fought similar plans, fearing that short-term consolidation would weaken the case for long-term action. The NRC's final safety evaluation, meanwhile, begins to clear the way for the panel to begin holding licensing hearings, which officials have suggested could take three years or more once they finally kick off. Given that, don't be surprised if the Yucca fight that starts in Congress later this year sticks around through the next election and beyond--just like Keystone before it."

Sen. Marco Rubio devoted a significant portion of his new book on economic opportunity to the issue. Sen. Rand Paul has explained that he is ""spending a lot of time going to areas of big cities where people live in poverty, and there is high unemployment, and there is this sort of despair, and I'm saying, 'You know what? Give Republicans another chance.' "" And Wednesday, Jeb Bush gave the first in a series of speeches devoted to inequality, which he says is the No. 1 issue of our time. His message was encapsulated by the Detroit Free Press headline: ""Jeb Bush in Detroit: Americans have right to rise out of poverty."" Is the Republican Party about to have a battle of ideas over poverty? There are several ways we'll know whether this new interest is real or simply a mark of political positioning. Of course, there are the policies the candidates will put forward, which will be evaluated on their merits. But perhaps even more important is the measurement of how a candidate spends his or her time. In a political campaign, there is nothing more valuable than a candidate's time. Where he or she goes tells us what the candidate really cares about. There hasn't been a robust effort to talk about poverty in the GOP nominating process since George Romney ran for president in 1967. During that campaign, he embarked on a 17-city tour of the ""ghettos,"" engaging in often confrontational exchanges with people who were never likely to vote for him. The level of risk-taking, candor, and general fearlessness in Romney's tour would put today's timid politicians in traction. ""We must rouse ourselves from our comfort, pleasure, and preoccupations and listen to the voices from the ghetto,"" Romney said in one speech. In August 2012, Paul Tough outlined President Obama's nonexistent public remarks on the issue in the New York Times. ""Obama hasn't made a single speech devoted to poverty as president, and if you visit barackobama.com these days, you would be hard-pressed to find any reference to the subject whatsoever."" When Rep. Paul Ryan asked Mitt Romney's campaign to highlight the issue on the campaign trail, he was told that it was off-message, according to one source familiar with his thinking. After the campaign, Ryan embarked on a concentrated self-education effort, traveling through poor neighborhoods. It became the backbone of his recent book The Way Forward. (Bob Dole's campaign strategists told Jack Kemp, Dole's running mate in 1996, that he was wasting his time campaigning in the poor neighborhoods of Harlem and the South Side of Chicago. Incidentally, Kemp was Paul Ryan's mentor.) In his remarks in Detroit on Wednesday, Jeb Bush outlined how a candidate builds legitimacy on an issue. In an answer to how he distinguishes himself from his brother and father, Bush said he did it as a gubernatorial candidate by hitting the streets. ""I knew I had to share my heart,"" he said. ""You've got to care for people before you get their vote."" Bush said he visited 250 schools. ""By the end of that journey, people knew I wasn't just the brother of George W. Bush,"" he said. ""I earned it by working hard to connect with people in a way that truly mattered."" Bush wasn't just connecting with people he met on his visits; he used the hard work to prove that he was going beyond offering rhetoric about education. So one measure of seriousness would be whether the candidates actually put themselves in the presence of the poor. While that may show seriousness of commitment, there are downsides to making such public forays. When Robert Woodson, president of the Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, took Paul Ryan on his yearlong tour of hard-hit neighborhoods, he and Ryan agreed to do it silently to keep it from being a circus show. Woodson praises Ryan for his deep commitment to the issue, which he says he hasn't seen yet from the other conservatives talking about poverty. ""I have watched how some of them have done it and so far I haven't seen the level of sincerity, it comes across as a gimmick,"" he says. ""It has been about themselves. None of these people seem to be able to get themselves out of the way and connected with people the way Paul did."" In the modern campaign, candidates in both parties spend much of their time at the other end of the income scale tending to the needs of wealthy financial backers and pleading for contributions from their wallets. As fundraising has become more important, time spent in close quarters with people who have little has decreased. Now the GOP's candidates are raising the stakes: The more they talk about poverty, the more it will highlight if there is a poverty of effort."

17	17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/republicans_hope_for_the_supreme_court_to_kill_obamacare_if_the_court_rules.html	"By the end of Tuesday, House Republicans will have held their 56th vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. At this point it's a ritual, meant to satisfy new members who promised their constituents they'd vote for Obamacare's repeal. And like the other votes, it won't succeed--the Senate won't act, and neither chamber has a veto-proof majority. But just because the vote is routine doesn't make it insincere; Republicans still want to scrap the ACA and they'll take any chance to do it. It's to their good fortune, then, that the Supreme Court might grant them an opening. If the court rules in favor of the challengers in King vs. Burwell, it will strip subsidies from the millions of Americans who purchase insurance through the federal health exchanges. If left to fester, this wound will likely destroy Obamacare and plunge the whole system into chaos, as insurance companies scramble to prevent a death spiral of sick patients and high costs. Thankfully, however, there's a way to treat the injury. With a simple patch--just a few lines of legislative language--lawmakers could stitch the damage and restore subsidies to the federal exchanges, precluding a disaster and actually saving lives in the process. But this won't happen, since for many Republicans, a Supreme Court blow to the Obamacare is an opportunity, not a problem. ""[King] alone is enough to bring down the health care law,"" said Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, noting the effect on the ACA if the court strikes subsidies from the federal health exchanges. ""We're going to continue to try to one, repeal; two, strip out the worst parts of the law; and three, look to the courts."" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky had a similar take. ""Who may ultimately take it down is the Supreme Court of the United States. ... [Y]ou could have a mulligan here, a major do-over of the whole thing--that opportunity presented to us by the Supreme Court, as opposed to actually getting the president to sign a full repeal, which is not likely to happen."" The honesty is refreshing. Why would you fix Obamacare when the court has handed you a final victory? And why would you save it when its forced collapse would vindicate your rhetoric? It's not as if Republicans have been generous with praise; despite rising rates of insurance and slower growth in health care costs, Republicans still insist the law has been a failure, and refuse to give credit for any improvements in the health care system. Indeed, if the court rules for the challengers, King vs. Burwell gives Republicans a chance to say I told you so and blame the collapse of the ACA on Democratic ineptitude, obscuring the extent to which the challenge was a deliberate attempt to sabotage the law. For an ideological team trying to win, this is smart strategy. But for a political party trying to prove its mettle ahead of the next election, it's terrible, irresponsible behavior. It's also self-defeating. Thirty-six states don't run exchanges and they're mostly led by Republican governors and statehouses. And of the 5.4 million middle- and working-class people who buy insurance on those exchanges, 87 percent receive subsidies. In other words, even if Congress doesn't act, Republicans will still be responsible for cleaning up the mess. This is one reason why some Republicans are beginning to wonder what the party does if the King challengers win. ""We've got a number of Republican senators who are talking,"" says Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander, who chairs the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. ""We are talking with Reps. [Paul] Ryan and [Fred] Upton in the House. We want to be responsible about repairing any damage that Obamacare does. If it creates a shock to the system by causing 5 million Americans suddenly to put their insurance and their subsidies at risk, then we need to think if there's anything we need to do."" Then again, Alexander continues, ""Maybe there's not."" Maybe there's not. That, I think, is the nut of the issue. For as much as there's some Republican concern for the consequences of King vs. Burwell--even as they cheer the challengers--there are many more in the party who don't care enough to bother with an alternative. All that matters for them is the win. Or, as North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr told Politico (in a voice that sounds flippant on the page), ""As far as I'm concerned, if King vs. Burwell is struck down, the White House is the one responsible to say what they're going to do next. ... They're the ones between a rock and a hard place because this is their plan."""	The GOP's Cynical Plan to Kill Obamacare	['Alexander', 'Upton', 'Barrasso', 'McConnell', 'Burr']	[]
18	18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/scott_walker_and_grassroots_conservatives_why_the_wisconsin_governor_isn.html	"Scott Walker is having a moment. After speaking at an event for conservative activists in Iowa last month, he's been riding high. The event featured nearly every potential Republican 2016 contender, and the general consensus was that the Wisconsin governor won the day. In fact, he came out on top in a Des Moines Register poll of likely Iowa Republican caucus-goers released Sunday, and Matt Drudge has dubbed him the ""clear frontrunner"" based on an unscientific poll of readers. In Walker World, things are looking good. Part of the reason he's risen so quickly is that he's been able to tout his executive experience. But this approach brings unique vulnerabilities, and some conservative activists in Iowa are starting to express doubts about whether Walker's gubernatorial record is as conservative as it sounds. That Des Moines Register poll may offer a little insight: Walker was the No. 2 choice for those looking for an establishment nominee and for those looking for an anti-establishment one. ""He's in a sweet spot,"" pollster J. Ann Selzer told the paper. ""People who don't want an ultra-conservative think he's OK. People who don't want a moderate think he's OK."" So at the moment, Walker is all things to all men. That may not last. On two of the issues nearest and dearest to the conservative base, Walker's positions are a little blurry. His record shows there could be openings for primary contenders running to his right--think Sens. Rand Paul and Ted Cruz--to try to peg him as a squishy RINO-surrender-caucus member. Immigration is the first potential problem area. In a 2013 interview with the Daily Herald Media editorial board of Wisconsin (which Daniel Strauss wrote up for the Hill here), Walker said he was comfortable with immigration reform that would provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. ""I think it makes sense,"" he said. Cue the red flags. Walker has repeatedly said he opposes amnesty for undocumented immigrants (he noted as much on Sunday on ABC's This Week), but as we've discussed here before, the definition of ""amnesty"" can vary widely from Republican to Republican. As a result, immigration hardliners on the right are often unforgiving of anyone perceived as soft on the issue. ""Anybody who is arguing right now about what's best for the people breaking the law, as opposed to what's best for the people obeying it, is going to lose,"" said Steve Deace, a conservative Iowa radio talk show host. (On Deace's website Monday, Todd Erzen told conservatives, ""Slow your roll."")  ""That sends a signal to conservatives you probably don't want to send if you're running for president."" The Common Core education standards could be another challenge for the governor. Their implementation has drawn passionate criticism from many conservative grass-roots and Tea Party activists around the country, and the Republican 2016 contenders--with the glaring exceptions of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie--have fallen all over each other to denounce them. Walker has also been a vocal opponent of the standards, and made the case for their repeal during his 2014 re-election bid. But since then, some on the right argue he's going soft. The Blaze, a news site that's part of Glenn Beck's media empire and that has substantial sway among grass-roots conservatives, ran a December headline that blared ""Scott Walker Is Dialing Back His Common Core Opposition."" That story reported that the governor had shifted his stance on the issue, favoring legislation that would let school districts decide to opt out instead of a tougher move to get rid of the standards. But on Jan. 17, Fox 11 reported that he reiterated his wholesale opposition to the standards. Shane Vander Hart, an Iowa organizer and activist who opposes the standards, said the jury is still out on whether Walker's stance on the issue is acceptable. ""Iowa voters care about action,"" he said. ""If he says repeal but signs into law a bill that accomplishes nothing to get rid of Common Core in his state, that's going to hurt him."" Conservative opponents of Common Core are no small constituency. A recent Bloomberg Politics/Des Moines Register poll showed that just 32 percent of likely Republican caucus-goers had no problem with Jeb Bush's stance on Common Core. That means it's an important issue to conservatives in the state, and it means that if Walker doesn't deliver, he could have some explaining to do. In this sense, Walker's greatest asset--his executive experience--could also become a significant vulnerability. ""I think he has a rather unique challenge in that there's a level of expectation for him that there may not be for some other people, because he actually has a trophy on his mantle,"" said Deace, referring to Walker's success in implementing legislation that cracked down on public sector unions. Walker's greatest advantage is probably that he's seen as a lawmaker willing to take on ""big-government special interests"" (a phrase he uses often) and fight for conservative policy priorities. If he doesn't break out that same fighting spirit for other issues conservatives care about, it could be a problem. ""If he doesn't do that on issues of Common Core and amnesty, people think, 'it's not because he can't; it's because he won't,' "" said Deace. The coming months will give Walker plenty of opportunities to put to bed conservative concerns about what he will and won't do."

19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/02/chris_christie_and_scott_walker_stumbles_why_what_matters.html	"Chris Christie and Scott Walker have had some minor stumbles in recent days. When New Jersey's governor was asked about President Obama's statement that parents should have their children vaccinated for measles, Christie's first reaction was to call for ""balance,"" seeming to weigh parental preference as much as public health. Soon after, his office issued a clarification that more forcefully advocated in favor of vaccinations. Walker, on ABC's This Week called for an ""aggressive response to ISIS,"" but when the Wisconsin governor was pressed on what that meant in Syria, his response was vague. Some may consider these disqualifying moments for two candidates auditioning for the presidency. The criticism was that Christie--who once said people who refused to evacuate during Hurricane Sandy were ""stupid and selfish""--was now calling for balance in public health only to appease the big-government skeptics in his party. An aide to one of Walker's Republican opponents said the governor's translucent answers on ISIS showed that while he may know about public sector unions, he has no understanding of foreign policy. But for that vast majority who might still be considering these candidates--or have yet to learn that they are even running for president--these early-round stumbles and threadbare answers should be welcomed. They offer a chance to learn something far more important about the candidate than their positions on the issues at hand. They offer us the chance to watch them learn on the job, a skill all presidents must have. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates was asked on Meet the Press this Sunday which quality he looked for in a presidential candidate. He said temperament, as he did a year ago when I asked him that question, but he also suggested voters should examine the people a president hires. Great presidents ""never considered themselves the smartest guy in the room,"" said Gates, ""but they wanted the smartest people around them. And then they could take their advice, shape it based on their own instincts and their own views. So I think the kind of people that a candidate wants advising him or her is critically important."" With both Christie and Walker, their answers were shaped more by wanting to present themselves in opposition to President Obama than they were by any informed worldview. But now both governors will presumably go to school on the subject of vaccinations and ISIS. They have to find the right people to talk to, ask the right questions, and formulate better answers. That is what a president does. In a few months they should be asked if their views have changed in the intervening period. If campaigns took place under laboratory conditions, then candidates wouldn't be allowed to blow off the question, saying it had been asked and answered long ago or that a past ""gaffe"" was a misinterpretation of their views. In their answers they would not only have to demonstrate a more considered response, but whether they have come to understand the related issues at play. Candidates can't be clueless on all issues obviously, but since the presidency is one surprise after another, it's as important to know how a president learns about what he doesn't know, as it is to find out what a president actually knows."

20	20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/public_apathy_has_helped_criminal_justice_reform_republicans_and_democrats.html	"A defining feature of the Obama era--or at least one of them--is polarization. Voters, and especially activists, are more uncompromising than they've ever been. This isn't a bad thing. Activist intensity--backed by public interest--can force action and make parties more responsive to their voters. Intensity, for example, is one reason President Obama made his executive move on immigration, and it's one reason Republicans are trying to push back with condemnation and countermeasures. Likewise, intensity is what pushed Democrats to pass health care reform despite the huge political costs, and it's why--nearly five years later--Republicans are still trying to repeal the law and its benefits. But, for as much as intensity contributes to politics, we shouldn't give short shrift to its sibling: public apathy. Apathy gets a bad rap, but when you look at its full place in the world of public policy, it's underrated. To be clear, apathy's reputation isn't undeserved. Politicians have long used voter disinterest as cover for corrupt behavior. And on issues toward which voters aren't attentive--but interest groups are--the public can get shafted. But the same shadows that cloak the worst of our lawmakers can also shield the best of them. On issues with which the problems are severe and about which voters are indifferent, politicians have a chance to act effectively for the public good without watching their rears. The best example is criminal justice reform. During the last decade, lawmakers across the country have pushed bold experiments in shrinking prisons and reducing incarcerated populations, unscathed by any kind of public backlash. In 2010, after two decades of ceaseless prison growth, Texas officials--supported by Gov. Rick Perry--moved to counter increasing costs of prison construction and incarceration with a new regime of treatment and mental health programs to give prosecutors and judges a third option besides jail or parole. It worked. The Texas inmate population has dropped from its peak of 173,000 in 2010 to 168,000 in 2013, without any increase in violent or property crime. Recidivism is down, and the state has saved an estimated $3 billion. You see a similar story in Georgia, where Gov. Nathan Deal has led the state to drastically change its approach to criminal justice. In 2012, lawmakers passed reforms that gave prosecutors non-prison options for adults arrested for minor crimes, and that gave judges more options for drug offenses, with a goal of reserving prison beds for violent offenders. And in 2013 the state passed reforms that would place minor juvenile offenders in social service programs, skipping the criminal justice system entirely. Likewise last year, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant signed a package with a similar set of reforms, including priority prison space for violent and career offenders, alternatives to incarceration for low-level offenders, and direct efforts to improve integration and reduce recidivism. And in Congress, a burgeoning coalition of Republicans and Democrats is working to reform several areas of the criminal justice system, from mandatory minimum punishments to asset forfeiture. On Tuesday, for instance, Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison--co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus--joined Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul in reintroducing the Fifth Amendment Integrity Restoration Act, which would limit federal, state, and local ability to seize property from criminal suspects. These changes are long overdue. As early as 15 years ago, we knew there were diminishing returns to incarceration. The steady growth of prisons and prison populations brought few additional gains to public safety. But 15 years ago, these reforms would have been impossible. Then, crime topped the list of concerns for the public. And while most Americans still believe crime is getting worse--a persistent feature of opinion polling on the question--actual criminal victimization is at its lowest level in a generation, and crime barely registers as an issue of national concern. (To that point, Sen. Paul and Rep. Ellison held a press conference for their bill. Six reporters came to the event.) On crime, in other words, the broad public just isn't that interested. And as such, there isn't a strong incentive for ""tough on crime"" rhetoric, crime-focused politicians, or punitive anti-crime policies. But for those on the other side of the issue--for politicians who want fewer prisons and less incarceration--there's an opportunity to push reform without fear of attack. And slowly, lawmakers are taking it. Thanks in part to public apathy, the country is beginning to make progress on one of our most important problems. But we shouldn't get too optimistic. Bills against asset forfeiture or for flexibility in sentencing are like the first few boards in a game of Ms. Pac-Man--easy to clear if you know what to do. To tackle the larger problems--overcriminalization, disinvestment in prison alternatives, and robust reintegration for former offenders--you need more: more will, more skill, and more support. You also need more money beyond the savings you gain from reform. And in politics, the moment you ask for cash is the moment the public starts to pay attention."

21	21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/indiana_s_medicaid_compromise_gov_mike_pence_s_deal_with_the_obama_administration.html	"Seen from a purely political vantage, this hasn't been the greatest week for Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, who is often mentioned as a potential dark horse for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. For one thing, the 2016 aspirant whose profile most closely resembles Pence's, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, is riding a boomlet following his strong performance at a conservative cattle call in Iowa last weekend. For another thing, Pence's launch of a new government-run news service, ""Just IN,"" ran into so much ridicule that it was shut down well before the first issue of the Pence Pravda could hit the newsstands. But Pence can take solace in the fact that he has this week achieved something far more consequential than these fleeting tribulations. His agreement with the Obama administration to expand Medicaid in Indiana on the state's own terms may very likely come to be seen as a major turning point in the central battle in the implementation of Obamacare. More than that, the staunchly conservative Pence may have taken a big step toward fundamentally reshaping one of the country's biggest safety-net programs--so much so that many liberals who generally cheer any expansion of coverage are feeling deeply ambivalent about this development. Their ambivalence is understandable. But in the context of the extraordinarily toxic political environment around Obamacare, the Indiana news should be viewed as a step forward. Some background: Half of the expansion of health coverage under Obamacare was supposed to come through raising the eligibility threshold for Medicaid, which varied greatly from state to state, to a uniform level of 138 percent of the poverty level--about $32,000 for a family of four or $16,000 for a childless adult. But in its 2012 ruling upholding the Affordable Care Act as constitutional, the Supreme Court also declared the Medicaid expansion optional. And many states--including most of those with the highest levels of uninsured, such as Texas, Georgia, and Florida--have rejected the expansion, even though the federal government would cover virtually the entire cost. This means that millions of low-income people remain uninsured--even as middle-class people across the country qualify for federal subsidies to help them buy private coverage--thus greatly undermining the central purpose of the law. The Obama administration has been so eager to close this coverage gap among the neediest Americans that it has cut deals with several states--notably Arkansas, Iowa, Michigan, and Pennsylvania--to allow them to expand Medicaid in ways that differ from the traditional program. But the concessions it made to Pence and Indiana go far beyond what it has agreed to previously. The expansion will cover 350,000 people in Indiana, which previously had very stringent eligibility levels--adults qualified only if they had young children and were virtually indigent, making less than a quarter of the poverty level. But under the plan, Hoosiers above the poverty level will have to pay a monthly premium of 2 percent of their income--as much as $25 a month for a single childless adult--for coverage. Those under the poverty level won't have to pay the premium to get basic coverage, but they won't qualify for dental and vision benefits unless they do pay the premium. The rule will effectively create a waiting period before people get coverage, as the state determines whether they're paying their premiums and what level of coverage they qualify for. And, in a first for Medicaid, Indiana will lock out people earning above the poverty level from their coverage for six months if they fail to pay their monthly premiums. Hoosiers on Medicaid will also need to make copayments--including, in an another first for Medicaid, paying $25 for an emergency room visit if they've previously made what are deemed to be needless visits to the emergency room. These may not sound like big sums or onerous requirements. But advocates for universal health coverage are worried that they'll deter Hoosiers from actually seeking coverage and care, because studies have found premiums and copays, even small ones, have a highly deterrent effect on the poor, which is why Medicaid has generally steered clear of requiring them. ""Medicaid was designed to make this coverage work for low-income people,"" says Leonardo Cuello, director of health reform for the National Health Law Program. Judy Solomon, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, worries that the sheer complexity of the plan--which also includes a health savings account where people are supposed to save for health costs--will keep many Hoosiers away. It's ironic that in making Medicaid more conservative, Pence has made it much more complicated and bureaucratic: ""They're going to have thousands making these tiny contributions, and then [the state] makes tiny payments to lots of providers. The transaction costs have got to be enormous,"" says John Holahan of the Urban Institute. Most of all, some advocates worry that the Indiana model will become the model for the other 20-odd states that have yet to expand Medicaid--or worse, the starting point, as even deeper red states seek bigger concessions for themselves, perhaps by insisting on bigger premiums and copays for people further down the income ladder. Sara Rosenbaum, of Georgetown Law School, worries that the Indiana plan could even become the model for congressional Republicans if they seek a major nationwide overhaul of Medicaid--which now insures 68 million Americans--as part of some future post-Obamacare realignment of health care. Cuello invokes the battles that followed the creation of Medicaid in 1965, when many states were also initially resistant to the program--Arizona did not accept it until 1982. What if the federal government had allowed reluctant states to chip away at Medicaid back then, instead of waiting them out on the assumption that they'd eventually join? ""My concern is that over the next decade, if we're rushing to get states in ... then what we're really doing is sacrificing the quality of what is there,"" says Cuello. ""Every time you make one of these concessions, you shift the goal posts. ... It's not just, was this a good decision for the residents of Indiana, but was it good for the entirety of the Medicaid program, and how it works over time and how these exceptions may be geared down the road to reduce the value of the program."" It's a valid concern, but the 1965 comparison assumes that the politics around the issue today are roughly the same as they were then, when the evidence suggests otherwise. The deal that many states are presented with today is, in purely economic terms, far more generous because of the near-total federal coverage of the cost of expansion. Yet so toxic has Obamacare become among Republicans that more than 20 states, including giants like Texas and Florida, are still resisting the expansion. One of the rationales for that resistance has been a classic anti-welfare distaste for giveaways: Why should people at this income level get free care when people further up the ladder are paying their fair share? This sentiment has deep and not entirely felicitous roots in many of these states, which Obamacare was intended to overcome by making coverage expansion a nationwide policy. But the Supreme Court blew up that nationwide approach. And now the Obama administration is left looking for ways to reckon with that anti-welfare mindset. Perhaps the best that can be done for now is to meet that rhetoric on its own terms and find ways, as was done in Indiana, to make beneficiaries ""pay their share,"" even if those requirements do nothing but create bureaucratic hassles for the state. In effect, the Indiana plan is a way to call the bluff of holdout states such as Texas and Florida, and say: If you're so worried about freeloaders, what about this? ""One of the real sources of optimism is that some Republican governors and the Obama administration are actually negotiating and finding a dignified path for both sides so that people can actually get covered,"" says Harold Pollack, a health policy expert at the University of Chicago. ""The slippery slope aspect to it is concerning, and it has ratcheted up the bargaining power of other Republican governors. But a lot of people are going to be covered, and it has legitimacy from the citizens of Indiana that the Obama administration cannot provide on its own."" He added: ""If someone came and said, 'Should we do this in Florida?' I would say yes in a heartbeat."" Or in Tennessee, which has been in its own negotiations with the Obama administration. Back in 2012, I visited a free weekend health clinic for the uninsured in the hills of eastern Tennessee and was truly stunned by the extent of the need on display.

22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/scott_walker_s_divisive_message_the_wisconsin_governor_doesn_t_think_he.html	"By the somewhat tamer standards of the Midwest, Scott Walker's speech to the Iowa Freedom Summit last Saturday was a smorgasbord of red meat. In just 20 minutes, the Wisconsin governor shed the persona that brought him to the stage--the stern but affable accountant--and re-emerged as a conservative warrior who defeated the unions, defunded the abortionists, and beat back the liberals to win three statewide elections for governor. His message, in short, was that he was effective, unwavering, and uncompromising. There was no need for outreach or a ""big tent."" With the right conservative message, Republicans could win elections--and win them in blue states--on their own. You could call this the Walker Way--victory through polarization. As my colleague Alec MacGillis described last year in the New Republic, it's how the former county executive became governor, survived a recall attempt, and won re-election. And if Walker can capture the nomination, it's how he might win the White House, too. Before heading there however, we should step back and look where the GOP stands in national politics. Even with its midterm success last November, the Republican Party still has two challenges to meet before 2016. First, it has to learn to speak to fears over income inequality without committing to a specific agenda and limiting its course of action once in office. And second, it has to find some way to deal with the party's pitiful showing with minority voters in the last presidential race. No, Republicans don't need to win Latinos, Asians, or black Americans (the latter is probably impossible), but a better margin makes the White House an easier reach. One path to both ends is to either move your policies away from the usual orthodoxy of upper-income tax cuts and deregulation, or at least graft a new branch to your existing agenda, set toward middle- and low-income Americans. Cut taxes for the rich and make a new refundable child tax credit; deregulate the financial industry and expand the Earned Income Tax Credit; slash welfare spending and help families migrate from high poverty neighborhoods. Take these policies (and the right rhetoric) to communities that don't normally vote Republican, and you might make inroads. You can call this the reformist approach. The other path is to question the challenges altogether. Do Republicans need to address inequality? Presidential elections turn on macroconditions more than anything else, and the fundamentals of 2016--like economic growth and the president's approval rating--slightly favor the Republican Party. A fresher message wouldn't hurt, but it might be stretching the case to say it's a challenge for the party. The same is true for expanding the coalition. It's an exaggeration to say Republicans need to win more minorities, since at present it's still possible for the GOP to win the White House on the strength of white voters. After the 2012 presidential election, the conventional wisdom was that Republicans needed to win over a greater percentage of nonwhite voters. But at Real Clear Politics, senior election analyst Sean Trende argued the opposite. For him, ""the most salient demographic change from 2008 to 2012 was the drop in white voters,"" and specifically, ""downscale, Northern, rural whites."" It's unlikely that these voters were liberal, and if they were in the electorate, there's a good chance they would have broken for Romney in large numbers. More importantly, Trende argues that the floor for Democrats' share of the white vote is lower--and the Republican ceiling higher--than is commonly understood. If that's true, then the GOP has an alternative strategy to broadening the base--it can deepen its support with its existing coalition. Or as he writes:"	Scott Walker's Strategy for Winning the White House: Divide and Conquer	['Romney']	[]
23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/jeb_bush_and_bill_belichick_at_andover_the_presidential_candidate_and_patriots.html	"There were some chuckles when New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick showed up at his press conference this past weekend to discuss Deflategate, aka Ballghazi, wearing a button-down collared shirt instead of his usual hoodie--a veritably preppy look for the surly football gnome. But really, no one should have been surprised, because Belichick in fact has deep preppy roots. How deep? He was at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, at the same time as John Ellis Bush, scion of America's preppiest leading family. And what a time it was. Now that John Ellis (you may know him better as Jeb) is all but officially running for president and Belichick is seeking to win his fourth Super Bowl amid one of the most delightful sports scandals of all time, it's worth revisiting the moment when the two men both walked the rarefied campus in northeastern Massachusetts, not just for the coincidence of their overlap there, but because it represented a quite remarkable locus of American cultural transformation. Jeb arrived at Andover in 1967 as a distinctly reluctant freshman. He had, earlier that year, been granted permission to stay in Houston with family friends to finish his eighth-grade year rather than accompany his family to Washington, where his father had just been elected to Congress. But that fall, he was shipped off to Andover, just as his father and older brother, George, had been before him. George's struggles to conform to family expectations are by now the stuff of national lore, but Jeb was also not keen on following the straight and narrow path laid out for him. He ""was experimenting and trying to figure out his role,"" his cousin John Ellis told Peter and Rochelle Schweizer for their 2004 book, The Bushes. At first glance, Andover would have seemed an oppressive environment for a teenager grappling with living up to his paternal example: Photographs of his father, a baseball standout in his time at Andover (and later a World War II hero), lined the school's walls. Jeb rebelled against that aura, albeit in quieter ways than his more extroverted older brother had done: Jeb was more likely to get high than go carousing, he grew his hair long, and he joined the Socialist Club. Yet as time went on, these small acts of insurrection were not so much breaking with the Andover mold as adapting to it. Jeb had arrived on the campus in the midst of a period of astonishing flux: Andover itself was experiencing its own countercultural coming-of-age moment as the upheaval underway on not-so-distant university campuses rippled outward. Where the prep schoolers' natural aspiration to be like their elder collegiate siblings had once meant mimicking their sports jackets and nicknames, it now meant copying their protest pose--a shift that the younger Andover faculty only encouraged. ""It was like a college campus in so many ways--there was very little supervision, and many of the faculty were themselves fully into the '60s,"" George Church, a Harvard geneticist who was one class behind Jeb, tells me. ""We were all much more grown up than we should have been, trying to be like our revolutionary colleagues at colleges."" In this context, he said, Jeb's sampling of mind-altering substances--touched on recently by Vanity Fair--was par for the course. ""There were a lot of experiences to be had in the '60s in this high school that was like a college, and Jeb availed himself of them, as we all did,"" Church says. The biggest cultural break came at the end of the school year in 1969, halfway through Jeb's tenure at the school. After much self-searching, Andover resolved to scrap its strict dress code, which had previously called for a coat and tie to be worn pretty much at all times, even when going to check one's mail, and a full suit for twice-weekly chapel. The school went beyond that to jettison the vast majority of its code of behavior. ""We got together and would sit together in these little groups and say, 'What should the rules be?' And the response was, 'No rules,' "" says Church. ""The rulebook shrank by a factor of five. The next year, we were just a campus of hippies."" There to witness this transformation, along with Jeb, were his fellow members of the Class of '71, a group that also included Lincoln Chafee, who would eventually assume his father's seat in the U.S. Senate, and Tom Foley, who would to go on to become a successful venture capitalist and George W. Bush's ambassador to Ireland before twice losing bids to become Connecticut's governor, in 2010 and 2014. (Just one and two years behind them, respectively, were authors Buzz Bissinger and Michael Beschloss.) And at the start of their senior year, they were joined by Belichick, who had come north for a postgraduate year after attending high school in Annapolis, where his father was working as a talent scout for the Naval Academy's football team, to improve his odds of getting into a premier college. The imagination reels at the thought of young Jeb and Bill engaged in marijuana-infused late-night bull sessions. Alas, such bonding would have been limited, because Jeb absented himself for three months of that school year for what was, essentially, the apotheosis of his adolescent walk on the wild side. That fall, he signed up for an experimental anthropology course with the expansive title of ""Man and Society."" Students read Octavio Paz and Beyond the Melting Pot, Nathan Glazer's new book on ethnic integration in New York. With this preparation, they headed off for a three-month immersion in an exotic locale--either the Irish working-class bastion of South Boston or the only slightly more foreign destination of Leon, a shoemaking hub in central Mexico. Jeb chose the latter, along with a dozen classmates and an irreverent young Andover teacher who served as the nominal chaperone. ""It was this kind of incredible junket that the school wanted us to spend a winter in Mexico,"" classmate Peter Halley, now an artist in New York, tells me. ""The atmosphere was like the TV show MASH."" Jeb lived with a local family and taught English. (Some accounts have him helping out with school-building as well.) More crucially, he fell in love with a local girl named Columba, a pretty, petite, devoutly Catholic 16-year-old who had been raised by her grandfather after her father abandoned her mother when she was young. Jeb decided to attend the University of Texas instead of Yale, the usual destination for Bush men, which allowed him to be closer to her, and proposed to her at a Mexico City restaurant before he'd even graduated--and before he'd introduced her to his parents. But his countercultural rebellion lasted only so long: After graduating, he got a job with Texas Commerce Bank, which had been founded by the family of his father's political ally (and future Secretary of State) James A. Baker III. And with that, Jeb was off to the races, as I describe in last week's New Yorker. Back in New England, Belichick took the more conventional preppy route, heading to Wesleyan, where he played lacrosse and squash. After graduating, he took an entry-level job with the Baltimore Colts, the first in a series of postings with seven different teams that would lead to the Patriots (where he hired as his ""research director"" another Andover Class of '71 graduate, his longtime friend Ernie Adams, who was implicated in the Patriots' spying scandal of a few years back.) Have Belichick and Bush kept up at Class of '71 get-togethers? Doubtful. Bush is less than fond of his Andover years--""I was a cynical little turd in a cynical school,"" he told the Miami Herald in 1986. So the reunion may have to wait. Perhaps until the White House in 2017, when America's third President Bush welcomes Belichick and the Patriots for their umpteenth trophy celebration? Presumably, Belichick would for that occasion revert to the Andover dress code--the pre-1969 one, that is."	When Jeb Bush and Bill Belichick Were High School Classmates	['Baker']	[]
24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/george_pataki_in_2016_the_former_new_york_governor_may_be_running_the_saddest.html	"When discussing presidential candidates, people who do so for a living usually refer to a number of amorphously defined tiers. There's the top tier (those likely to launch competitive bids, like Sen. Rand Paul and Jeb Bush), the second tier (candidates who could be competitive if they hit their stride, like Sen. Marco Rubio and Gov. Scott Walker), and bottom-tier jokesters who seem primarily interested in selling books (Newt Gingrich) and basking in the CPAC love (Donald Trump). This year, though, there's another tier: the Pataki tier. ""Who's George Pataki?"" you might ask, if you're under 30. Don't let anyone hold your ignorance against you. George Pataki, a moderate Republican who favored stricter gun control laws and abortion rights, served three terms as governor of New York. Since then, he has busied himself with pondering White House bids and launching the George E. Pataki Leadership and Learning Center. He also joined the Chadbourne and Parke law firm, and co-founded a consulting practice, the Pataki-Cahill Group. Every four years, the former governor floats that he might answer the call to serve his country if such a call comes, and every four years people sort of squint and shrug. His overtures fail to inspire the hair-pulling rage that Sarah Palin's name generates, and he's never had the cartoon-twirly-eyed devotion that Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul managed to snag. This hasn't kept him from looking for ways to flex his GOP-cred before early-primary state notables, which is what he would have done in New Hampshire this week had the blizzard not forced him to cancel his travel plans. Past efforts have been comparably lackluster, starting with his eponymous monument to his leadership. The New York Times reported that the George E. Pataki Leadership and Learning Center recently closed its brick-and-mortar location in Peekskill, N.Y., due to lack of interest. Despite that, the Pataki Center still fights the good fight in cyberspace, where its website optimistically proclaims, ""TODAY, WE ARE MAKING HISTORY."" It's a bit light on original content. One page features pictures of all the New York governors. If you click on one of the images, you'll go to a page with a short paragraph on when that governor served. Until Tuesday afternoon--when I contacted Pataki's spokesman David Catalfamo--these paragraphs were copy-and-pasted, without attribution, from the New York Hall of Governors website. For instance, you can compare Pataki's page on Gov. DeWitt Clinton with the New York State Hall of Governors' page. The site appears to have copied the entries for all 56 governors. The Hall of Governors did not respond to a request for comment. After I reached out to Pataki's spokesman, the site added attributions. Besides the plagiarized mini-bios of the state's 56 governors, the site also includes a short page encouraging people to give money to the center (there is no link where one can do so, if you were wondering), two short paragraphs explaining how the center aims ""to make the American dream a reality for the next generation of young New York leaders,"" a ""Memorable Speeches"" page that only includes one speech, and a ""Remembering September 11"" page that includes brief remarks the governor gave on the day of the 9/11 attacks. This is unfortunate, as is much of Pataki's online presence. In 2010, he helped create a group called Revere America that aimed to capitalize on the nascent Tea Party to push back against the Affordable Care Act. He left the group 10 months later, and it shuttered shortly after his egress. Its website boldly soldiers on, though, despite being partially cannibalized by ads for Internet bingo. On the site's front page, posts titled ""Rick Santorum's take on the Middle East crisis"" and "" 'I'm Not Concerned About The Very Poor' says Mitt Romney"" peacefully co-mingle with entries titled ""Bingo Bash - the number 1 android bingo game"" and ""Go shopping in New York, courtesy We Want Bingo."" There may be an upside here; bingo appears to be a popular pastime in Iowa. The former governor hasn't visited Iowa for this election cycle, but he has been to New Hampshire and South Carolina. And he's started a political action committee called We the People Not Washington. On the Media section of the PAC's site is posted the text to a curious article titled ""GEORGE PATAKI--QUIETLY CONNECTING WITH CONSERVATIVES UNDER RADAR: 'National Media Clueless.' "" Though the media section doesn't link to the article or give its origin, it appears to have first been published on a site called Conservative Base. It reads like a protracted Internet comment. ""Sorry Hillary, once they see and hear George Pataki, most Americans will want him answering the 3AM phone call [sic],"" says the article. ""Yep, the national media and political elites sure didn't see this one coming."" It is technically possible that Pataki will surprise the national media and political elites once the American people see and hear him. It is much more likely that--despite all the bingo-riddled websites in the world--Pataki won't be heard from for another four years."

On Saturday, instead of basketball, I watched as a man lay with his face pressed against the floor, for half an hour. Robin May, a photographer standing next to me in the press area, asked the security guard if the man was OK. ""He's just praying,"" the guard said, ""he must have a lot of people to pray for."" We were at The Response, an evangelical prayer revival organized by the American Family Association, a known hate group. More than 3,000 people had gathered to save America, through prayer and fasting, from the threats of Sharia, homosexuality, pornography, and abortion. Materials promoting the event described natural disasters including Hurricane Katrina, as well as the national debt, as the just result of America's sins, punishments akin to the biblical wave of locusts. People cried as they sang along to Christian rock. A woman wearing a blue T-shirt with the word ""Life"" stood in front of TV cameras and raised her arms. One preacher, as if he were speaking to a classroom, exhorted the audience to pray together, saying, ""Get in your groups."" He specified, ""Small groups."" I watched as young men huddled together, a few speaking in tongues. One of them, Jesse, told me, ""We don't want revival, we need revival."" Me? Instead of fasting, I sinned and snuck in a root beer float from Frostop, a Baton Rouge institution. The headline speaker of The Response was Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. He provided personal testimony about his conversion to Christianity while he was a student at Baton Rouge Magnet High School, which is also my alma mater. The event was supposed to be apolitical in nature, but it was widely viewed as part of the rollout for Jindal's inevitable run for president. New Orleans' Gambit described Jindal's presidential ambitions as the ""worst-kept secret in Louisiana politics."" In 2011, Rick Perry, then Texas governor, held his own gathering of The Response in Houston's Reliant Stadium. Perry announced his campaign for the presidency five days later. The promotional materials for Jindal's event were the exact same ones Perry used. Someone even forgot to change the dates. Before they were taken down, prayer guides for The Response said Hurricane Katrina happened six years ago (it has been almost a decade). Jindal's staff and political allies have insisted The Response was a religious gathering rather than a political one, in an attempt to avoid the appearance of exploiting faith. Timmy Teepell, Jindal's former chief of staff and his most important political adviser, attended the rally with his family. When I asked Teepell about the politics of the event, he told me that there were ""no political implications, just spiritual"" ones. Still, the political overtones of Jindal's participation in the event were obvious. On letterhead from the governor's office, Jindal invited the 49 other governors to attend the event. None did. Jindal's current chief of staff, Kyle Plotkin, was darting around the event, ensuring it went off without hiccups. Even Jindal's giant belt buckle declared, ""Bobby Jindal State of Louisiana."" Jindal and other speakers prayed for the different branches of government and for President Obama. Louisiana state Sen. Jonathan Perry called for more ""born-again Christians"" to be elected to political office. Another speaker said, ""When our government sanctions [abortion], it brings reproach upon our land."" She insisted that ""the right to abort will be overturned,"" but in the meantime, the ""payment for bloodshed is blood."" Pastor Bob Phillips announced that a group of pastors was ""rising up"" against ""America's pestilence"" and fighting against people who wanted to ""silence the voice of those who would make biblical application"" to politics. He said that pastors were ignoring requirements of their churches' tax-exempt status that they not make political speeches from the pulpit, and they were sending the IRS videos of themselves endorsing political candidates in their sermons. The event was so political that the Louisiana Conference of Catholic Bishops, despite participating in a pro-life march nearby, declined to take part. Rob Tasman, the LCCB director, said, ""The event was viewed more as an evangelical event with a political tone to it, and the bishops don't participate in such events."" In the crowded GOP field for 2016, Jindal needed this event to be a political kick-starter. Congressman Steve King held a summit in Iowa at the same time as The Response, and Jindal missed out on the opportunity to meet with crucial Iowa voters and reporters covering the race. So The Response needed to pay for itself politically. But while Perry brought out 35,000 people to listen to him in 2011, Jindal's rally was about as crowded as my high school graduation ceremony, which was also held in the PMAC. By the time Jindal spoke in the afternoon, hundreds of people had already left, and entire sections of the bottom ring of bleachers were empty. It was a bust. Even among the 3,000 attendees who were there, there wasn't much excitement about Jindal 2016. The attendee named Jesse told me, ""We gotta put all that denominational, all that political junk aside."" The couple running the intercessory prayer room (when evangelicals throw an event, they have volunteers not just as ushers and security but also volunteers who pray for the event itself) explained that it would be wrong for Jindal to use this event to run for president. The Response kept reminding me of high school. Jindal's story of his conversion was couched entirely in his high school experience, including a pivotal moment in which he talks with a ""pretty girl,"" whom he had a crush on, about her dream of becoming a Supreme Court justice and overturning Roe v. Wade. Everything was superficial and black and white, in the way adolescents see the world. Jindal didn't want to look deeper than this: ""In the end, our God wins."" Another feature of high school was prominent at the event: bullies. In recent days, Jindal has expressed support for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage and claimed that Europe has Islamic ""no-go zones"" ruled by Sharia law. Another bully present was the organizer itself: the American Family Association. Bryan Fischer, the AFA's director of issue analysis, has made statements such as: ""Homosexuality gave us Adolf Hitler, and homosexuals in the military gave us the Brown Shirts, the Nazi war machine and six million dead Jews."" Fisher made some particularly offensive statements in a blog post about Pocahontas: ""She not only recognized the superiority of the God whom the colonists worshipped over the gods of her native people, she recognized the superiority (not the perfection) of their culture and adopted its patterns and language as her own. ... Had the other indigenous people followed her example, their assimilation into what became America could have been seamless and bloodless."" This sort of nastiness was on full display Saturday. Hundreds of LSU students and professors showed up to protest Jindal and the AFA. One of them, Majdal Ismail, was speaking about her family's experience with Islamophobia, when one of the attendees of The Response harassed her and shouted: ""Why aren't you wearing a burqa?"" It took police intervention to make him stop. Jindal may say, ""our God wins,"" but, thankfully, in the end he almost certainly won't do so by making Bobby Jindal the next U.S. president."

26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/scott_walker_performs_well_at_iowa_freedom_summit_the_wisconsin_governor.html	"Before the Iowa Freedom Summit on Saturday, one Republican activist summed up Gov. Scott Walker's challenge this way: ""He doesn't make the flashbulbs go off."" But at the end of the marathon day of speeches before conservatives, the Wisconsin governor emerged as the leading light. There were plenty of well-received speeches during the day from Sen. Ted Cruz and Ben Carson, but it was their home turf. The Freedom Summit, put on by Rep. Steve King and Citizens United, was a gathering of the base of the Republican base. But it was a bit of a SkyMall event--while there were lots of offerings it wasn't clear if there was a place for the most exotic ones. Donald Trump, for example, may say he's considering running for president, but it's as hard to believe that he will be president as it is to understand the need for an Eye of the Dragon Mystical Safe Box. Walker did the most to help himself politically, elevating his stature as a candidate who might achieve the elusive synthesis of pleasing the party base while also attracting a general election audience. ""Wow he's good,"" said Jane Hodoly, as Walker spoke. Later, in an interview, the Tea Party member from Ottumwa, Iowa said, ""We need a warrior in the presidential office."" Walker, who retold the story of his battle with the unions (along with the death threats he faced) and what it took to win three elections in four years (including becoming the first governor to survive a recall) appealed to this desire. ""If you are not afraid to go big and bold, you can actually get results,"" Walker told the audience. Pat Scanlon, another Tea Party member, from Oskaloosa, Iowa said: ""I wish he were our governor."" Walker took the stage with a handheld microphone and walked across it as he spoke--making sure the audience got the point by saying he was causing trouble for the photographers trying to keep up with him. Stagecraft matters because while conservative hero Ronald Reagan perfected the use of the teleprompter, that speech aid is now seen as villainous because Obama relies on it so heavily. (The theory is that his trickery is laid bare when he has to speak extemporaneously.) Trump, whose role is to represent the id of a certain kind of anti-Obama voter, received big applause when he suggested that the teleprompter be banned. Stagecraft also matters for Walker because in conversation with Iowa voters and organizers they mention again and again how they want to be excited by a candidate. When some have talked about Walker, they unfavorably compare him to Gov. Tim Pawlenty, another nice, neighborly Republican who was considered too tepid. But as Walker spoke you could almost hear the political boxes being checked off. He thanked the conservative voters of Iowa, and the country, for supporting him in his fight against unions with money and prayers. This wasn't only good form--it highlighted that he has a national fundraising base (i.e. he can go the distance) and that he is a man of faith (i.e. he's just like you). Perhaps the best moment was when Walker made an analogy about taxes by talking about buying a sweater at a discount at Kohl's department store. He talked at length about cobbling together so many coupons and store rewards until ""the next thing you know they are paying me to buy that shirt!"" As an analogy it was confusing, but that wasn't the point. The message was: I'm one of you. For a party competing over how to talk to middle-class voters while fashioning a response to President Obama's appeal to them, this wasn't a bad way to connect with voters who often care most about whether a candidate understands their lives. The best any candidate can hope for at an event that appeals to such a narrow but influential audience is if the activists leave the hall talking about you. Still, the candidates don't want to say anything to the faithful that turns off the broader class of voters. Essentially, they are aiming to do the opposite of what Sarah Palin does. If Walker offered a strong showing, Christie helped himself by just showing up. Several in the audience said the New Jersey governor was too moderate to be worthy even of their consideration, but for Christie the goal isn't winning over the hall; he is just trying not to stir up enmity the way Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney do. Throughout the day Romney and Bush were poked and lampooned by various speakers. There were many specific critiques, but former Speaker of the New Hampshire House Bill O'Brien captured the overriding political feeling when he said: ""We lose when we nominate RINOs."" Winning the approval of conservatives--or at least avoiding overt hostility--is just one of the many tests a candidate must pass. They've also got to raise money, develop a general election message, and hire staff. Jeb Bush wasn't in Iowa, but in San Francisco, where he gave his first major speech since declaring in mid-December that he's seriously considering a presidential run. He talked about the ""academic and political hacks"" in Washington with ""hard-core ideology,"" saying, ""they're basically Maytag repairmen ... Nothing gets done. It is time to challenge every aspect of how government works--how it taxes, how it regulates, how it spends--to open up economic opportunity for all."" His words were an implicit critique of the audience that had gathered in Iowa, which wants more ideological fealty from its Washington representatives.

As I talked to people working for the major GOP presidential candidacies, I asked who had signed up the organizers and super-volunteers crucial to turning out the vote in the first contest in the GOP nominating process. Everyone had a list of commitments. In the Jeb Bush and Chris Christie camps, they think they're being supported by some of the same people. The 2016 election may seem like a distant prospect for many people. It is, after all, almost two years from now. In Iowa, where the voting takes place in 12 months, activity is already clicking along at a brisk pace. Some Republicans in the state are saying that candidates, like Bush, haven't started soon enough. Whether a candidate is actually behind in Iowa must be considered in context. Most people in Iowa's political class have an interest in getting things started early. They want the state to be the first robust contest of the nominating process. They covet the visits and the personal calls from the candidates. Some want to get paid. The earlier that candidates start, the more they need pricey strategists and paid organizers. So lots of people have an incentive to push a hurry-up message. The upside of starting early is obvious. ""This isn't like a normal election, where you convince people,"" says Craig Robinson, the founder of the Iowa Republican website. ""You have to convince them and keep them convinced."" That takes skill, and that skill is getting snapped up by other campaigns. The argument for waiting is that you can focus on other elements of your campaign (like raising money) and that a strong message or money (or both) can jump-start a slow organizational pace in the state. Plus, Iowa can be a graveyard for candidates who get in too early. The famous flameouts include Lamar Alexander in 2000, Mitt Romney in 2008, and Tim Pawlenty in 2012. All put considerable energy into the state, and when voters didn't rally to their banner, their campaigns either ended or were crippled. The message there is don't put all your chips on Iowa. But the state has also boosted campaigns: See Lamar Alexander 1996, Barack Obama 2008, and Rick Santorum 2012. Those campaigns have followed the old formula: Organize, organize, organize, and get hot at the end. Organizations are usually staffed with operatives who have well-established networks from working previous election cycles. Robinson calls them tribes. David Kochel, who oversaw Mitt Romney's Iowa operation and who helped get Sen. Joni Ernst elected in November, leads one tribe. A.J. Spiker and Steve Grubbs, who are backing Sen. Rand Paul, each represent their own tribes. Christie's backer Jeff Boeyink represents a tribe, too.* The allegiances to the tribe are sometimes closer than the allegiances to the candidates. This came through clearly in a conversation with one operative who said of a talented volunteer, ""He's not with Bush, he's with me."" Jeb Bush is setting the pace of the national GOP contest by launching a massive fundraising operation to intimidate his rivals. On the ground in Iowa, though, his footprint is light. Romney has his team from last time, though Kochel has not said if he will support the former Massachusetts governor again. Christie has a gang built up from all his visits to Iowa as head of the Republican Governors Association. Christie visited the state several times, purportedly to help Gov. Terry Branstad's re-election, despite the fact that Brandstad was one of the least vulnerable incumbents running. Paul has his dad's organization, though for some he is not sufficiently pure. Santorum and Gov. Rick Perry also have roots. Bush doesn't have any organization from the past, which leads some to wonder if he'll even try to compete hard in the caucuses. This week he called the Iowa Republican chairman, Jeff Kaufmann, to tamp down any speculation that he will overlook the state. It's amazing how quickly that message was digested; almost everyone I talked to mentioned that one phone call. What such a call does--or what Bush hopes it does--is keep some slice of organizers from signing up with other campaigns. Apparently, those awkward conversations will come a little later. *Correction, Jan. 24, 2015, 2:48 p.m.: This article originally misstated that Chuck Larson was backing Chris Christie. Larson has not picked a candidate. (Return.)"

Just 33 days before the midterm elections, the Republican National Committee Chairman headed to George Washington University to give a speech on the issues that bring Republicans together. Priebus ticked off a lengthy list of policy proposals that all the party's candidates could highlight, noting that they could work for anyone, ""whether you're running for governor in New England or Congress in the South or statehouse in the West."" The speech was highly detailed. The chairman praised specific pieces of legislation and touted the construction of the Keystone Pipeline and the passage of a Balanced Budget Amendment as issues that could unite GOP politicians. On these points and many others, Priebus was clear as glass. But on one enormous issue, the chairman was oddly opaque. ""As Republicans we're pro-family; and we're also pro-life,"" he said, according to the transcript of his prepared remarks. ""So when a woman faces an unplanned pregnancy, society should offer our support and compassion. She should know that adoption is possible. Our laws should be improved to make adoption an easier path for families who want to open their homes to children."" And that was it. The GOP is pro-life, the chairman said, so the GOP supports making adoption easier. Priebus didn't add anything beyond that. He couldn't have, given the reference to the party's New England gubernatorial candidates, almost all of whom are pro-choice. As the last 24 hours have shown, anti-abortion votes are a dicey prospect for some Hill Republicans. And the Keystone Pipeline just might have broader support among Washington Republicans than the pro-life movement. That's not to suggest that GOP is about to become pro-choice. (That would be ludicrous.) When it comes to American politicking, the GOP is unquestionably the best hope of the pro-life movement. Priebus wrote an op-ed for LifeSiteNews that appeared on Thursday--the same day as the March for Life--that celebrated the GOP's support for legislation restricting abortion. ""We must do everything we can to protect life and defend the rights of those who can't yet defend themselves,"" he wrote. And he described himself as ""a pro-life chairman of a pro-life party."" That's true. But it's also complicated. When it comes to abortion, the party's platform is unequivocal. ""We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children,"" it reads. But here's the thing: Plenty of prominent, powerful Republicans don't buy that. A few weeks after Priebus's George Washington University speech, pro-choice Republicans had a strong showing in the midterm elections. Charlie Baker, for example, won the governor's race in royal blue Massachusetts by two points. And Bruce Rauner, a pro-choice, Romney-esque gubernatorial candidate, walloped Democratic incumbent Pat Quinn by nearly 5 percentage points in Illinois. In Nevada, pro-choice Gov. Brian Sandoval sailed to re-election and would likely win warm backing from national Republicans if he challenged Sen. Harry Reid. In the Senate, two Republicans--Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Mark Kirk of Illinois--have the same score of 40 percent on the National Right to Life scorecard as Reid. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, is just 10 points ahead of them. It's instructive to contrast the Republican Party's inclusivity on the issue with the Democrats'. There's a steady trickle of Democratic state legislators joining the GOP because of the issue--see Washington state Sen. Mark Miloscia and Missouri state Rep. Linda Black--while national Republicans went out of their way to make pro-choice midterm candidates like Massachusetts' Richard Tisei and Oregon's Monica Wehby feel welcome in the party. It is almost as if Republicans are taking the advice that Sen. John McCain dished out shortly after the party got spanked in the 2012 elections. The Arizona Republican went on Fox News Sunday and said that the party should ""leave the issue alone"" because it hurts them with young voters and women. His basic point was that Republicans should talk about how they're pro-life, but avoid actually doing anything about it. At the moment, this seems to be the House Republican leadership's strategy. National Journal reported that Rep. Renee Ellmers told her colleagues that voting for the 20-week ban could hurt them with millennials. They proceeded to pull the bill at the last minute, and House leadership is currently scrambling to rewrite the language of the 20-week ban in a way more amenable to some members. Some Hill Democrats praised the decision to scuttle the bill. Rep. Loretta Sanchez, a California Democrat, said she thinks the move is a sign the party is changing. ""I believe that they're coming to a realization that America is a pro-choice country, that the majority of Americans realize that Roe v. Wade should stand,"" she said. ""So I think they're having a conflict within their own Republican conference."" ""There are two parties within the GOP,"" she added. Rep. Trent Franks, the Arizona Republican who sponsored the bill, sounded chagrined. ""There's no animosity or anger on my part, whatsoever, toward anyone,"" he said. ""I only hope now that all of us, especially on the pro-life side, will come together and do what's necessary to move forward to affect this critically important goal of protecting pain-capable babies and their mothers from this atrocity of very late-term abortion on demand."" He added that he was sure the bill would have passed overwhelmingly if it had gotten a vote. That's probably true, but it never got that far."

29	29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/republican_convene_hearing_attacking_obamacare_the_affordable_care_act_is.html	"Now that Republicans are in control of both chambers of Congress, the push to slay Obamacare by a thousand cuts is officially underway. But if the first stab is any indication, Republicans are going to need some sharper knives. On Thursday, Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander, the new chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, convened a hearing on one of the measures Republicans have been championing as a means to undermine the Affordable Care Act: changing the way it defines full-time work. Under the law, any employer with 50 or more full-time workers must provide them with decent health coverage or pay a per-worker fine of $3,000. To expand coverage as broadly as possible, the law's Democratic authors defined full-time employees as anyone working 30 or more hours per week. Since then, Republicans have been invoking anecdotal reports of employers cutting back the hours of workers who are just over the 30-hour threshold to keep from having to provide them with coverage--even though the mandate was postponed until this year for large companies and next year for smaller ones. GOP lawmakers say the solution is to define full-time workers as those putting in 40 hours. Thirty hours ""is a strange definition--one that sounds more like France than the United States,"" said Alexander as he kicked off the hearing. It was a good line, but the hearing went downhill for Republicans after that. Instead of leading the charge in eviscerating Obamacare, the 40-hour workweek bill is showing just how messy and politically fraught the business of gutting the law is going to be. For starters, there is the basic problem that President Obama has made clear that he'll veto the 40-hour measure. If he does, Republicans could still seek to use the proposal as a cudgel to attack the law politically, but even here there are problems. The Congressional Budget Office has given the measure a decidedly unfavorable review. It estimates that the bill would result in as many as 1 million workers having their hours cut to put them under the new 40-hour limit and thereby losing their employer coverage; about 500,000 workers being left without any health coverage at all; and the deficit increasing by more than $50 billion as a result of fewer employers paying the $3,000 fine, as well as more people turning to Medicaid and federal subsidies to purchase their own insurance after being denied employer coverage. Even worse, perhaps, several prominent conservatives have come out against the revision--notably Yuval Levin, one of the right's most influential policy wonks, who wrote in National Review that changing to 40 hours would inevitably cause more Americans to lose hours than the 30-hour rule does, because there are far more workers just at or above that threshold than at the 30-hour threshold. ""By setting the definition lower, Obamacare's architects were trying to mitigate the damaging effects of the employer mandate some,"" Levin wrote in a burst of intellectual honesty, ""and by setting it higher Republicans would be worsening those effects."" Alexander forged on Thursday despite this inauspicious context. He and Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins, one of the co-sponsors of the 40-hour measure, invited a trio of witnesses to testify for their side: Doug Holtz-Eakin, the former CBO director and economic adviser to John McCain's 2012 campaign; Andrew Puzder, the CEO of CKE Restaurants (Hardee's and Carl's Jr.), and Betsy Webb, the school superintendent in Bangor, Maine. Puzder and Webb were in a tough spot: They were there to talk about how onerous the 30-hour workweek definition was for their enterprises, but what that really meant was having to explain why they were not providing health coverage to so many of their workers. This task was made more difficult by the contrast with the Democrats' lone witness--Joe Fugere, the owner of a small pizzeria chain in Seattle who has, even before the passage of Obamacare, offered generous benefits to any of his employees working more than 24 hours a week. Puzder said that CKE had offered coverage to more than 5,000 hourly employees who work more than 30 hours, but that fewer than 500 had taken the company up on it. Furthermore, many of their Hardee's and Carl's Jr. franchisees simply could not afford to provide coverage to part-timers. ""Our franchisees are always trying to keep costs down--that's the way American businessmen and women succeed,"" he said. Unmentioned in Puzder's discussion of the fast-food industry's tight margins was his own compensation: $4.48 million in 2012. Webb, the school superintendent, had a more sympathetic case to make, but it, too, had its dissonance. The 30-hour rule, she said, was causing Bangor problems with its substitute teachers. They do not receive health coverage, but some of the substitutes whom the district relies on the most bump up against the 30-hour limit. To avoid that, the district will need to scatter hours among more subs, thus creating more instability in its classrooms--if a teacher is out sick for a week, the district will need to retain two different subs in that classroom rather than just one. ""I worry about students on free and reduced lunch status, with at-risk factors,"" she said. ""The consistency of the person they have in that room has a great impact."" It was a fair point, but left unspoken was the obvious follow-up: If these core substitute teachers were so integral to the district, shouldn't they be getting health benefits? The Democrats on the panel, in the minority for the first time in eight years, relished cross-examining the Republicans' witnesses. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the panel's top Democrat, noted that Puzder's claim--that Hardee's and Carl's Jr. workers who did not get coverage at work could get Obamacare coverage instead--did not hold up in the many states that have rejected the law's Medicaid expansion. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts quoted Yuval Levin's criticism of the 40-hour change and noted the irony that Republicans were pushing a measure that would both raise the deficit and make more people reliant on Obamacare. ""This bill is corporate welfare,"" she said. ""Big corporations would be able to cut their coverage, and taxpayers would get stuck with the tab. I'm against adding $53 billion to the deficit so corporations can push their responsibilities onto the government."" This provoked Puzder, the CEO, into taking a shot at the CBO's deficit estimate. ""I love the CBO, but have they ever estimated anything that is accurate? I mean, really?"" This off-message outburst--delivered with former CBO director Holtz-Eakin sitting right next to him--in turn earned Puzder a rebuke from his putative ally, Alexander, who reminded him that it was the CBO that had done the fast-food industry a big favor with its estimate of high job losses under a minimum-wage increase. Not that there weren't some awkward moments for Democrats, too. For all their warnings about employers dropping coverage if the mandate is switched to 40 hours, the fact is there are plenty of liberals who believe that the employer mandate should be repealed, period--that everyone would be better off if more people got coverage on their own, with government help as needed, rather than getting it through their jobs. When Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont socialist, made this point, the discomfort on his side of the table was palpable. The Democrats also seemed unwilling to reckon with Holtz-Eakin's main argument: that it was unclear why employers would drop people to under 40 hours to avoid covering them, when the fact is that employers had until now been choosing to cover those people even without a mandate. But the Democrats likely would have been more willing to address his point if they had more faith that Holtz-Eakin and Republicans were genuinely trying to improve the law's workings and reduce its undesired side effects. As it is, as Minnesota Sen. Al Franken noted, Holtz-Eakin's current employer, the American Action Forum, asks visitors to its affiliated website to ""help us stop Obamacare."" And Republicans have been distinctly unwilling to make obviously necessary tweaks to the law, such as fixing the wording glitch that has resulted in a Supreme Court challenge to it. Not to mention that Republicans on the health committee had ample opportunity to negotiate the language they preferred on questions like the employer mandate back in 2009, when Democrats were desperate to get some bipartisan buy-in for the legislation. Now that they're in control of the hearing room that Ted Kennedy once presided over as chairman, Republicans are trying to undo what was done without them. But their hearts don't really seem in it. At one point halfway through the hearing, Alexander and Collins were the only Republicans in the room, while nearly all the Democratic chairs were full. By the end, it was hard to miss which side thought it had come out on top. ""This,"" said Murray, the committee's top Democrat, ""was a very good hearing.""
