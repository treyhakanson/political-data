Here are the 66 scenarios that could hurt Clinton that I am most worried about:	The 66 Things I Am Worried Will Go Wrong for Hillary Clinton in the Debates
1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/the_truth_about_the_clintons_and_haiti.html	"Last week, during a swing through Miami, Donald Trump stopped by a community center in Little Haiti. Trump has never held much interest in Haiti or Haitian Americans, and it showed. Instead of the usual bluster, the reality TV star tentatively read some vague, prepared remarks off a sheet of paper, then sat back on a stool ""to listen and to learn"" for a few minutes from the small crowd of mostly middle-aged, upper- and middle-class Haitian Americans in dark suits and print dresses, scattered among a few rows of folding chairs. Not long ago, Trump's team glommed onto the possibility that Haitian Americans--generally black, generally Democratic-leaning voters who make up roughly 2 percent of the population of Florida, where Trump and Hillary Clinton are separated by less than a point--might be persuaded to vote against the former secretary of state. The irony of a nativist pandering to thousands of immigrants and refugees aside, there was a logic to this. Many people rightly identify Clinton with failures of humanitarianism and development in Haiti. The Trump team has folded that perception into a half-true narrative in which Haiti--like Whitewater and Benghazi before it--becomes a synecdoche for all the ills, real and imagined, of the Clintons themselves. There are good reasons the world's first black republic has been an island-sized headache for Clinton as she seeks the presidency. Haiti is a place where some of the darkest suppositions that lurk on the left and right about her and her husband take form. Here is an island country of 10 million people where America's ultimate power couple invested considerable time and reputation. Here is a fragile state where each took turns implementing destructive policies whose highlights include overthrowing a presidential election. Bill Clinton in particular mixed personal relationships, business, and unaccountable power in ways that, if never exactly criminal, arouse the kind of suspicion that erodes public trust. No two individuals, including Haiti's own leaders, enjoyed more power and influence than the Clintons in the morass of the failed reconstruction following the deadly Jan. 12, 2010, earthquake, when a troubled country managed to go from catastrophe to worse. The Clintons compounded the resulting political problem the way they usually do, by saying as little as possible while letting their enemies fill in the blanks. A year before he became Trump's campaign ""CEO,"" Breitbart News chairman Steve Bannon began pushing facile theories of corruption and malfeasance in the book Clinton Cash, written by Peter Schweizer under the aegis of Bannon's Orwellianly named Government Accountability Institute. It was later turned into a film. Both versions of Clinton Cash tell a kaleidoscopic version of Haiti's post-quake story, remixed and more than occasionally fudged to push the Clintons into the center. Those flawed but relatively measured accounts in turn inspired whack-job theories that have become articles of faith in the anti-Clinton fever swamps, such as the fantasy that Hillary and Bill just straight up stole billions of dollars in post-quake relief money--an impossible claim so unmoored from reality that even Peter Schweitzer didn't bother making it. The reality is a lot more complicated (and interesting) than that. The United States and Haiti were the first two independent republics in the Americas, and our often blood-soaked relationship goes back a lot further than the meeting of a silky Arkansan and an ambitious Illinoisan at Yale Law School. Trump, probably unwittingly, submerged himself in some relatively recent chapters of that history at the Little Haiti Cultural Center. His host was Georges Saati, a wealthy Lebanese-Haitian industrialist whose family backed the brutal 20th-century dictatorships of Francois and Jean-Claude Duvalier and whose far-right faction helped foment the violent overthrow of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 2004. Trump was also treated to a speech by Bernard Sansaricq, a radical right-wing ex-Haitian legislator whom the Los Angeles Times once called the ""self-proclaimed president of Haiti's Senate"" and who collaborated with the military junta that ruled during Aristide's first exile in the 1990s, following a coup carried out during the George H.W. Bush administration by former Duvalierists on the CIA payroll. Trump was so moved that this week, his staff published another statement by Sansaricq on its website. Both wealthy Haitians openly loathe Bill Clinton, who ordered the U.S. invasion that put down the junta and restored Aristide to power, for a time. Sansaricq, who long ago left Haiti and ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Congress as a Republican in 2010 and 2012, repeated nonsensical, Breitbart-esque claims about ""the whole world"" having given ""billions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation for the Haitians"" (false: The Clinton Foundation has raised about $30 million in connection with Haiti and was at no point a general clearinghouse for post-quake relief money) and promising Trump the Haitian American community's support if he will ""ask Hillary Clinton to disclose the audit of all the money they have stolen from Haiti."" Trump nodded thoughtfully. ""I didn't understand,"" he said, ""now I understand it."" He didn't. I know, because I've spent years looking into what's really gone on in Haiti. I was the Associated Press correspondent in Port-au-Prince from 2007 to 2011 and survived the earthquake in 2010. I've spent years digging into the details of the response and recovery, much of which I put in a book. I've also done extensive, critical reporting on the Clintons' roles in particular, which is why my name appears halfway through the Clinton Cash documentary, misleadingly implying that I was some sort of corroborating source. In all that time, neither I nor anyone else has found the coveted evidence of either Clinton making off with vast sums of money from Haiti or the relief effort. And while America's foremost power couple may be as culpable as anyone for the disastrous results of the earthquake response, it is fundamentally misleading to say that they are singularly responsible for it, much less for America's long and abusive history with its oldest and poorest neighbor. I wish things were that simple. * * * There's a real case to be made against Hillary Clinton in Haiti. From her first days as secretary of state, Clinton saw the island republic as a place to ""road-test"" a central piece of her foreign policy vision of ""elevating development alongside diplomacy and defense as core pillars of American power."" Haiti would be a major example of ""economic statecraft,"" as she called it, where business and government partner to address natural disasters, poverty, and disease, neutralizing threats while generating money and power for the United States--what her husband would call a ""win-win-win."" Clinton has gotten grief in this election for that kind of thinking, exemplified elsewhere by a 2011 speech in which she pitched reconstruction in Iraq, eight years after the U.S. invasion, as a ""business opportunity."" In reality, what she is pushing has been standard U.S. foreign policy for more than a century. (In Iraq, she was very late to the party.) It's no less true when it comes to ""humanitarianism."" The U.S. government devotes less than 1 percent of its budget to ""foreign aid,"" most of which goes to vendors based in the United States. For instance, nearly half a billion dollars of U.S. government relief aid ""for Haiti"" following the 2010 earthquake went to the Defense Department. The vast majority of U.S. government contracts went to American firms; almost no cash ever went, or was intended to go, to Haitians or the Haitian government. The same is true for nearly all nongovernmental organizations and charities, including the American Red Cross. Despite promises to change this way of doing aid, both Clintons rode herd on business as usual--Hillary as head of the State Department (which effectively includes the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID), and Bill in his panoply of roles, including co-chairing the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission (IHRC), a nominally Haitian government agency charged with overseeing the allocation of reconstruction money donated by foreign governments to a World Bank-managed fund for 18 months after the earthquake.* USAID, ignoring recommendations to hire Haitian contractors, brought in several U.S. firms (and one Mexican firm) to build a housing development. The added cost of flights, hotels, cars, food allowances, living expenses, and ""danger pay"" ballooned the cost per house from $8,000 to $33,000, investigative reporter Jake Johnston found. Ultimately two of the American contractors were suspended from receiving future government contracts. ""Out of ignorance, there was much arrogance,"" a Haitian official told Johnston. But when the right isn't beating the Clintons over the head about it, this pattern--keeping the money close to home--is how most conservatives, and a lot of other Americans, want foreign aid to work. Clinton's insistence that relief and development efforts yield benefits for American businesses and consumers is aimed mostly at critics who don't understand that this is how U.S. aid and intervention always operate. (That includes Trump himself, who told a Fox News town hall in April: ""We have many, many countries that we give a lot of money to, and we get absolutely nothing in return, and that's going to stop fast."") Before and after the earthquake, the State Department openly and enthusiastically pushed a vision of prosperity for Haiti through foreign investment in tourism, construction, and low-wage garment factories. In its view, this would save Haitians from poverty and prevent future refugee crises while making money for American and multinational corporations. That idea is badly flawed--among other things, the low wages and sweeping tax exemptions investors demand mean little money flows into the local economy--but it's the program every single U.S. presidential administration has backed in Haiti since at least the 1960s. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Haiti produced huge quantities of cheap clothes, toys--and at one point all the baseballs used in the U.S. major leagues--earning it the nickname the ""Taiwan of the Caribbean."" It's a bipartisan effort: Clinton's vision of ""economic statecraft"" isn't all that different from the policies Ronald Reagan was pushing when his administration created the Caribbean Basin Initiative. But efforts to resurrect the assembly sector, which collapsed in the turmoil following the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship 1986, got ugly. A few months before the quake, U.S. embassy officials pressured the then-Haitian president, Rene Preval, to nix a legislative proposal to raise the minimum wage for garment factory workers from roughly 22 cents an hour to 62 cents an hour, arguing that higher wages would discourage investment. Preval and legislators compromised at 38 cents an hour. (It has since gone up.) Bill used his newly minted position as U.N. special envoy to promote the economic agenda. ""In the end all of our efforts will have to be judged by how many jobs we create, how much we swell the middle class, and whether we perform for the investors and make them a profit for doing the right thing,"" he said at the time. Once the disaster struck, the U.S. government focused its reconstruction efforts on pushing this vision. That resulted in the construction of Caracol Industrial Park, a $300 million, 600-acre industrial development built to house garment factories in northern Haiti. The project was financed through U.S. tax money via USAID, as well as the Washington-based Inter-American Development Bank. The Clinton Foundation helped promote the project to investors. Bill and George W. Bush teamed up to lobby Congress together to expand trade preferences for Haiti-sewn apparel. Bill also used his position with the IHRC to direct further funds to the project. With the help of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, a former South Korean trade minister, the organizers recruited Sae-A Trading Co. Ltd., a South Korea-based global garment giant that supplies many of the clothes you buy at Target, Walmart, Gap, Old Navy, and other stores, to be the anchor tenant. All that was at stake when, 11 months after the earthquake, Haiti held a presidential election. Millions were still displaced and polling places in rubble, but the United States and its allies were paying for the election and insisted it go on. The process fell into chaos in the first round, with riots in the streets and candidates accusing each other of manipulation and fraud. The electoral mess increased the Americans' frustrations with Preval; they blamed his recalcitrance and skepticism about foreign intervention for the slow pace of reconstruction. The U.S. embassy openly fanned the flames by saying the official electoral results conflicted with a European Union-sponsored poll. U.S. officials then pushed Preval to throw his party's candidate out of the second-round runoff and replace him with Michel ""Sweet Micky"" Martelly, a raunchy pop singer who enthusiastically backed foreign investment projects including Caracol. (Martelly had also proved receptive to guidance from foreign political hands.) Clinton's State Department played hardball behind the scenes, revoking the visas of Preval's inner circle and banding with France, Brazil, Canada, and the United Nations leadership to pressure the president into stepping down. Then, on Jan. 30, 2011, the secretary personally flew to Port-au-Prince. The night before, she had traded emails with her chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, as well as the Clinton Foundation's chief operating officer, Laura Graham, who also served as Bill's chief of staff on the IHRC. In one email, Graham said resistance was building against the U.S. plan and that the secretary had been ""specifically criticized today for imposing this solution."" Mills suggested that Clinton emphasize a message in response: ""The voices of the people of Haiti must be heard. The votes of the people of Haiti must be counted fairly. And the outcome of this process must reflect the true will of the Haitian people. That is the only interest of the United States."" Hillary delivered that message almost word for word to the Haitian and foreign press the next day. Behind closed doors, she sweet-talked Preval, convincing him that accepting the U.S.-backed candidate would secure his legacy. Martelly became president in May. In his inaugural speech he declared, in English: ""This is a new Haiti open for business, now!"" Bill was in the audience. Initially, Martelly accepted Garry Conille--Bill Clinton's chief of staff at the U.N. Office of the Special Envoy--as his first prime minister. But sensing a babysitter, Martelly quickly booted him out and replaced him with his own business partner. ""The situation cannot afford Washington to sit on sidelines. They elected him and they need [sic] pressure him,"" Graham grumbled to Mills in an unusually candid email. The earthquake recovery foundered, inflation spiraled, and violence spiked. Martelly left office earlier this year amid an unfinished, fraud-wracked election; for a week, the country had no president. Haiti is now struggling with a weak, transitional government. Demonstrations loom, as do strikes and threats of takeover by armed militants. Caracol opened in 2012 with both Clintons joining Martelly (and an acquiescent Preval) at the opening ceremony. The project has been a disappointment by any measure. Sae-A brought in a fraction of the jobs it promised. Its employees grumble about the long hours, tough conditions, and low pay. The project has had little positive impact on Haiti's economy so far. * * * Trump has criticized Caracol on the stump, referring in a recent speech to the time that ""Hillary Clinton set aside environmental and labor rules to help a South Korean company with a record of violating workers' rights set up what amounts to a sweatshop in Haiti."" It's a hypocritical complaint for a mogul who employs his own sweatshop labor in China and Central America. Small wonder that he dropped that line of criticism at the Little Haiti event, where his hosts were wealthy industrialists whose opposition to Aristide (and Bill Clinton) was rooted in large part in the former Haitian leader's resistance to garment-factory owners and foreign investment schemes. Still, it's only a bit overstated--while Hillary built nothing alone, her State Department pushed hard to get the park up quickly, over the objections of other administration departments. But what the shallower critics of the Clintons miss is whom this fundamentally unjust system is designed to benefit. Despite cherry-picked, half-understood stories about permits for nonexistent gold mines and isolated instances of naked (and duly punished) fraud that account for rounding errors in the actual billions raised and spent after the earthquake, there is simply no evidence that the intent was to line the Clintons' pockets. The system isn't designed for them; it's for us. The low wages that the U.S. embassy helped suppress are the reason we can enjoy a steady stream of $9 Mossimo camisoles and $12.99 six-packs of Hanes T-shirts. Even U.S. military uniform parts get made in Haitian sweatshops. As America moves further away from its producer past and deeper into its consumer present, we will want cheaper and cheaper smartphones and cheaper and cheaper clothes that we can afford on our stagnant service wages, and we will demand our leaders find us alternatives to sourcing from rivals like China. Places like Caracol are the result. Some Americans say they want production jobs to come back home, but few are ready to pay twice as much for their clothes or $100 extra for their iPhones, most of which would still have to be sourced from overseas. To get the things we want, the United States has been in the business of overturning elections and toppling governments for more than a century. Clinton's trip to Haiti in 2011 represents the softer end of a long tradition of U.S. invasions, coups, and usurpations: Panama in 1903 to Iran, 1953; Guatemala, 1954, to Congo, 1961; Vietnam, 1963, to Chile, 1973, to Iraq 2003, and on and on. The U.S. Marines occupied Haiti from 1915 to 1934, helping foster the overcentralization--whereby American-run businesses and breaks on custom duties were concentrated in the capital--that made the 2010 earthquake so deadly.  And we have been meddling ever since--ferrying leaders out and in and out again. As Trump was reminded in Little Haiti, Bill Clinton ordered the 1994 U.S. invasion. George W. Bush ordered his in 2004. The U.N. peacekeeping mission that dumped cholera into Haiti's waterways a few months after the quake had nothing to do with Clinton's U.N. Office of the Special Envoy; it was created years earlier, during the Bush administration, to take over from his U.S.-led force and has been kept there and aggressively defended by administrations through Barack Obama's in large part because it is cheaper than sending U.S. troops back again. That military might is used, explicitly, to keep things from deteriorating to the point that thousands of Haitians flee toward Florida, as they did in the 1980s and 1990s. Why? Because as it turns out, a lot of Americans aren't fond of refugees. None of this gets the Clintons off the hook for the actions they are personally responsible for in Haiti. I've asked Hillary's spokesman many times to comment on how things have turned out there and what if anything she would do differently as president. He said once that she'd comment ""when the time comes to do so."" That was back in April 2015. I'm still waiting. Bill continues to mix his post-presidential fame and Haiti business matchmaking in ways that set off alarm bells--often in conjunction with his trademark quarter-million-dollar speaking fees. In the reconstruction effort, he often partnered with Irish cell phone company Digicel and its head, Denis O'Brien. The company helped arrange at least one lucrative speaking engagement for the former president, while the Clinton Foundation ""facilitated introductions"" to help O'Brien build a luxurious new Marriott hotel next to Digicel's Port-au-Prince headquarters. USAID has directed about $1.3 million to Digicel since 2008, along with private grant money. Digicel has donated tens of millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation. It's hard to say how, or even if, any of those parts fit together: Digicel was dominating Haiti's cell phone market and doing development work there long before the Clintons re-engaged with the country in 2009. USAID money started going to Digicel while George W. Bush and Condoleezza Rice were running U.S. foreign policy, and most has been paid out since Clinton left the State Department. An indirect speaking fee is hardly proof of a kickback scheme. Still, the relationship is clearly an example of the many ways money and celebrity combine and strengthen each other at the highest levels of power. But it ignores all history and logic to pin the whole sordid tale of Haiti's relief and reconstruction disasters on one couple, no matter how powerful they have been. Turning legitimate criticisms about U.S. intervention into a question about one candidate's personality is a way of avoiding harder questions. The Clintons didn't create the world we live in; they just know how to navigate it better than most of us do. If we want it to change, we have to change it.  And it seems clear that electing a strongman leader who turns to putschists for advice on the developing world and who has never shied away from making money by working with corrupt regimes isn't the answer. Changing a system that operates with millions of people and trillions of dollars will take more than shunting all the evils of empire onto one or two personalities--not when we benefit from them so eagerly and almost never change ourselves when it counts. Pretending otherwise is just a way to let ourselves off the hook, too.

It's even stranger to watch four different people tell the same lie, all within hours of each other. The first was Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, sitting in an interview with Martha Raddatz of ABC News. Raddatz conducted the interview on Saturday, but it aired on Sunday morning. Her first question was simple and pointed. ""On Friday, for the very first time, Mr. Trump said that Barack Obama was born in the U.S.,"" said Raddatz. ""Why did it take him so long?"" Pence demurred and Raddatz asked again, pressing the Republican vice presidential nominee on Trump's long obsession with the question of President Obama's birthplace. ""We counted since April of 2011, the year that Barack Obama gave his long-form birth certificate from Hawaii. We counted 67 times where Donald Trump tweeted or retweeted messages questioning his birthplace,"" she said. Facing clear evidence that Donald Trump had been a leader in the ""birther"" movement, Pence made a pivot. ""Well, and I know there's news reports that trace this birther movement all the way back to Hillary Clinton's campaign back in 2008,"" he said. Raddatz was incredulous. ""You believe that Hillary Clinton started the birther movement?"" she asked. ""Look, I'll let the facts speak for themselves,"" replied Pence. The facts do speak for themselves. Team Trump insists otherwise, but there is no evidence that Hillary Clinton is responsible for the ""birtherism"" myth. At most, the Clinton campaign (shamefully) attacked Obama for his so-called ""foreign"" background. It never questioned his birth or citizenship. According to James Asher, former Washington bureau chief for McClatchy, Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal pushed the birther theory to journalists. Blumenthal has denied the accusation, and there's no evidence--no documents, no notes, no corroborating stories--to support Asher's claim. At best, Pence is misstating the facts. At worst, he's lying as part of a deliberate strategy from the Trump campaign. That sounds far-fetched, until you realize that other surrogates were saying the same thing on different networks. On Monday, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie sat for an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper. After a brief discussion of the bombing in New York City, Tapper turned the conversation to Friday's press conference. ""You have been clear for a long time that Barack Obama was born in the United States. Donald Trump, by contrast, he clung to the birther lie for years. He still isn't apologetic about it,"" said Tapper. ""Do you understand why so many people, including African Americans, are upset with him over the issue?"" Christie went down the same path as Pence, blaming Clinton for spreading birtherism and applauding Trump for settling the issue. ""Donald has now made his position on it clear, which is that, after the president presented his birth certificate, Donald has said he was born in the United States, and that's the end of the issue,"" said Christie. Tapper pushed back. ""Well, just as a point of fact, again, Donald Trump did not accept when Barack Obama released his birth certificate in 2011. He kept up this whole birther thing until Friday. That's five years."" And without skipping a beat, Christie denied the charge. ""No, that's just not true. It's not true that he kept it up for five years,"" said the New Jersey governor. ""It is simply not true."" Except, again, it is true. On Twitter and on television, Trump constantly questioned President Obama's origins, even raising the issue at the beginning of this year, ahead of the Iowa caucuses. Either Christie doesn't know this, or he's simply lying. The case for ""lying"" gets stronger when you consider the conversation on CBS's Face the Nation, just an hour after Christie gave his performance. There, in an interview with John Dickerson, campaign manager Kellyanne Conway made the same, roundly debunked arguments as her colleagues: that Hillary Clinton is responsible for birtherism, and that Trump somehow resolved this issue. ""And so this started with Hillary Clinton's campaign, number one,"" said Conway. ""Number two, it was Donald Trump who put the issue to rest when he got President Obama to release his birth certificate years later."" Dickerson corrected her on both counts, but she wouldn't budge. Neither would Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, who also spoke on Face the Nation. ""[B]y the preponderance of the evidence before us, Hillary Clinton or her campaign were definitely involved in this issue,"" said Priebus. ""So, we can't keep saying it's not true. That's ridiculous."" That Priebus would follow suit moves this from a strategy of casual lying--both to the press and to the public--to something more ominous. Priebus is the leader of one of the largest and most influential Republican institutions. By giving his assent to this neo-birther conspiracy, he makes it official--a talking point for any Republican who wants to use it. A certified defense for the fact that the party's nominee spread a racist conspiracy theory for five years, in an effort to delegitimize the first black president of the United States. On Monday evening, at a rally in Miami, Donald Trump used the occasion of the recent bombing in New York City to rail against immigrants, describing them as snakes that will inevitably attack the United States. It is a message of outright ethnic exclusion, the centerpiece of Trump's campaign of white nationalism. And it reflects the same attitudes that brought us birtherism. Once, those attitudes lived on the fringe of the Republican Party. Now, like Trump himself, they are the Republican Party. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Republicans Aren't Done Lying About Birtherism
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/donald_trump_is_still_a_birther.html	"Donald Trump is still a birther. It's true that, at a press conference Friday morning, the Republican presidential nominee told an audience, ""President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period."" And it's true that the New York Times declared a little while later that Trump had elected to ""surrender to reality"" on the question of Obama's birth, ending a ""remarkable campaign of relentless deception that tried to undermine the legitimacy of the nation's first black president."" But this is overly generous. We are talking about a candidate whose campaign is defined by its unbridled contempt for truth and accuracy. Take the tenor of the event. The press conference was slated for 10 a.m. but didn't begin for another hour. When Trump arrived, he delivered an infomercial spiel for his new Washington hotel, then ceded the stage to several veterans, all of whom praised Trump for his leadership and resolve. One of those military figures, retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney, is himself a birther. In 2010, he wrote an affidavit on behalf of a lieutenant colonel who was refusing to deploy to Afghanistan on the grounds that Obama was foreign-born and thus an illegitimate president. The affidavit likewise questioned Obama's authority, citing ""widespread and legitimate concerns"" about his place of birth. ""He is the one single person in the Chain of Command that the Constitution demands proof of natural born citizenship,"" wrote McInerney. It takes a certain audacity to open a press conference about birtherism with a supporter who backs the very conspiracy supposedly being renounced. And although Trump mouthed the words that affirmed Obama's citizenship, he ignored his role in fanning the conspiracy by pointing the finger at the Democratic presidential nominee. ""Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy,"" he said. ""I finished it."" This is false. The Clinton campaign wasn't clean; strategist Mark Penn proposed attacking Obama for his alleged ""lack of American roots,"" and photos were circulated of the then-Illinois senator in traditional Muslim garb, which sparked waves of condemnation from Obama supporters and the media. But, as detailed by the Washington Post's Dave Weigel in a piece last year, there's no direct link between the birther conspiracy and Clinton, other than rumors spun by her most recalcitrant supporters in the closing days and weeks of the Democratic primary. Birtherism only entered widespread consciousness after Trump adopted it as a cause, revitalizing the conspiracy. Indeed, birtherism was the catapult that launched Trump into conservative fame, giving him a platform that culminated this year in his nomination by the Republican Party for president of the United States. (Vox offers a helpful timeline of Trump's birther advocacy.) In a February 2011 speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference, the reality television star voiced his suspicions about Obama. ""Our current president came out of nowhere. Came out of nowhere,"" he told the crowd. ""In fact, I'll go a step further: The people that went to school with him, they never saw him, they don't know who he is. It's crazy."" The next month, speaking on the View, Trump demanded to see the president's birth certificate. ""I want him to show his birth certificate. I want him to show his birth. ... There's something on that birth certificate that he doesn't like."" The innuendo continued, this time on cable news. ""If you are going to be president of the United States, you have to be born in this country. And there is a doubt as to whether or not he was,"" said Trump on the O'Reilly Factor at the end of March that year. ""He doesn't have a birth certificate. He may have one, but there's something on that, maybe religion, maybe it says he is a Muslim. I don't know. Maybe he doesn't want that. Or he may not have one. But I will tell you this. If he wasn't born in this country, it's one of the great scams of all time."" Trump continued this line through April of that year, when President Obama released his original long-form birth certificate. At which point, Trump simply changed focus, demanding to see the president's college transcripts. ""The word is, according to what I've read, that he was a terrible student when he went to Occidental. He then gets to Columbia; he then gets to Harvard,"" Trump said. ""Maybe that's right, or maybe it's wrong. But I don't know why he doesn't release his records."" In his statement on Friday, Trump says he ""ended"" the birther controversy. Not only does this depend on the false idea that Clinton had started it, but it's also false in its own right. Obama's actual birthplace remained an obsession for the real estate mogul, a perennial subject of his tweets and interviews. ""An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama's birth certificate is a fraud,"" tweeted Trump in August 2012. ""Attention all hackers: You are hacking everything else so please hack Obama's college records (destroyed?) and check 'place of birth,' "" he tweeted in September 2014. And that came after he defended his birtherism in an interview on Irish TV. ""The president should come clean,"" Trump said. When the host said that Obama had produced a birth certificate, Trump cast further doubts. ""Well, a lot of people don't agree with you, and a lot of people feel it wasn't a proper certificate,"" Trump said. Trump spread birther ideas in 2015--""a lot of people question it,"" he said in a question-and-answer session with Fox News' Sean Hannity at CPAC--and he pushed it as recently as this January, in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, where he also cast doubts on Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's citizenship. Donald Trump came to national political prominence as an advocate for this racist conspiracy theory. For five years afterward, he worked to delegitimize the president as a foreign outsider. Until today, he still refused to answer the question of Obama's birth, denouncing the question in a recent interview with the Washington Post. Birtherism isn't a lark for Trump. It isn't an eccentricity or something to look past. It's the core of his political identity--the thing that gives coherence to his attacks on Mexican and Muslim immigrants and figures such as Judge Gonzalo Curiel. It is the original expression of his belief that citizenship is ultimately tied to blood and ethnicity and that some Americans are inherently more suspect than others.

Bush embarked on a pan-Asia trip that included a stop in Japan. The nominal goal was to reach an agreement addressing America's trade deficit. But all anyone remembers of the visit is that Bush, stricken with the stomach flu, tipped over during a state dinner and vomited in Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's lap. How did the coverage of that incident compare with the reporting on Hillary Clinton's wobble on Sunday? The New York Times offered reassurance. Bush had succumbed to a ""Benign, but Sometimes Scary, Illness,"" it comforted readers in a gastroenteritis explainer. This was the prevailing tone of all the coverage of Bush's hurling, despite the widely aired and alarming footage of the president appearing to lose consciousness at the dinner table. Where was the panic? Where was the speculation? Clinton wobbled, and the media freaked. Bush ralphed, and the media cooed. He was 67 years old on the day he puked all over the Japanese premier. There'd been a health scare the year before when Bush was hospitalized with an irregular heartbeat, later diagnosed as a symptom of Graves' disease, a thyroid condition. Last year, Bush biographer Jon Meacham revealed that the president suffered a second, unpublicized cardiac episode, also attributable to Graves', in July 1992, and that the condition and his medications for it kept him under the weather for the rest of the year. But Bush, running for re-election in 1992, managed to avoid having his health become a matter of significant political concern, even after fainting face-first into Miyazawa's pants. This was partly because Bush, unlike Clinton, lacked partisan enemies willing to whip wild conspiracy theories about his well-being into a national frenzy and partly because Bush had cultivated an impression of vigor in the political press. It was his reflexive concern for appearing healthy, as Andy Card--then Bush's acting chief of staff--recalled recently to Politico, that prevented him from taking the ambulance offered after leaving the dinner, even though he was sick enough to continue vomiting in the presidential limo all the way back to his hotel. That impression of good health was built on less dramatic days, photograph by photograph and video clip by video clip: Bush hunting, Bush fishing, Bush golfing, Bush running, Bush playing tennis. In fact, just hours before the dinner, he and the U.S. ambassador to Japan, Michael Armacost, had played two doubles sets with the Japanese emperor and crown prince, which doctors suggested to the media might have aggravated his fatigue and illness. As it happened, the day of the dinner was among the lighter ones on the president's schedule during the trip, which, as Reuters breathlessly reported, spanned 10 days and nearly 20,000 miles:"	In 1992, Bush 41 Puked in the Japanese Prime Minister's Lap.

5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/propublica/2016/09/trump_s_home_school_voucher_plan_a_dumb_idea_that_no_one_wants.html	"A version of this story was originally published by ProPublica. GOP nominee Donald Trump has said he plans to spend billions of dollars on so-called school choice programs. The $20 billion in federal funds would be available only to what he says are 11 million children living in poverty who are also ""trapped in failing schools."" Families will be eligible for vouchers to send their children to charter, magnet, or even private religious schools. On Friday, he announced the policy would include home schooling as well. ""School choice is at the center of this civil rights agenda, and my goal is to provide every single inner-city child in America that is trapped in a failing government school the freedom to attend the school of their choice,"" he said at a conservative voters conference. ""School choice also means that parents can home-school their children. Hundred percent."" But there's one problem with Trump's home-schooling plan: Impoverished home-schoolers mostly don't exist. ""Ideologically speaking, this is significant, but practically very few students will use this money to home-school,"" said Milton Gaither, an education professor at Messiah College. Gaither saw the announcement as a gesture to conservative Christians instead of an actual plan for poor families. ""I don't see a mass movement of the nation's poor applying for federal funding so they can educate their children themselves."" The National Center of Education Statistics paints a clear picture of who home-schools-- and it isn't poor inner-city families. In 2012, only 5 percent of home-schooling families made less than $20,000 per year--which is just under the poverty line for a family of four. The survey also shows that 83 percent of home-schooled children are white, and almost 85 percent belong to two-parent households. Home-schooling parents are also far better educated than average--about three-fourths of them have completed at least some higher education. By comparison, all of the 11 million children his plan targets are in poverty. Two-thirds of children in poverty are nonwhite. Only a third of poor children live with married parents, and more than 60 percent of parents of low-income children have no higher education. Christopher Lubienski, an education professor at Indiana University who studies home schooling, said these families are unlikely to take up home schooling because of the ""huge opportunity costs"" involved even if the federal money might soften some of the blow. Single working parents, for example, are unlikely to give up their full-time jobs to stay home and educate their children in exchange for a few thousand dollars via Trump's vouchers. Trump has not given any details about how his plan would work--other than to say that states would have leeway in spending the money. The campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In addition to the $20 billion in federal spending--which adds up to one-third of the Education Department's total current budget--Trump has asked states to kick in another $110 billion. It is quite unlikely that states would spend anything like that. Almost identical voucher proposals for impoverished students have failed at both the state and federal levels, and Trump offers no reason why his plan would not meet a similar fate. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, proposed a $24 billion bill in 2015 that would have given poor families vouchers for private schools. The bill failed in a Republican-controlled Congress. Several state governments have also failed to pass voucher programs, including conservative states like Texas and South Carolina. ""If it's coming out of other school budgets, state legislators have been very hesitant to pass voucher bills even if they like the idea in general,"" Lubienski said. Another reason vouchers for home schooling haven't been successful is because current home-schoolers actually oppose them. They see them as a vehicle for more government regulation. Government, after all, isn't in the business of handing out money with no strings attached. The Home School Legal Defense Association, which has long fought against home-schooling regulations, is opposed to vouchers. ""HSLDA opposes vouchers as they are not a free hand-out from the government and will regulate parental freedoms,"" the group says on its website. The organization has successfully lobbied against bills in Nevada and New Jersey that would have given home-schoolers money. It even called out then-presidential candidate Ben Carson when he hinted at his support for vouchers. The group, interestingly, has not come out swinging against Trump's proposal. ""Usually when the government is offering free money, there are strings attached, but we don't know enough about Mr. Trump's plan to make any comment one way or the other,"" said Michael Farris Jr., the HSLDA media relations representative, who said they'll continue to monitor legislation introduced in Congress next year ""to make sure home-school freedom is protected.""

6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/poll_says_trump_s_up_five_points_in_ohio_should_we_freak_out.html	"These are not the best days for Hillary Clinton. Some Democrats, as well as certain professional Republicans who want Clinton to beat Trump but can't say so, are beginning to get nervous about the closeness of the election. Is Clinton still a comfortable favorite, and we're just in the midst of a down moment? Or is the race officially settling into toss-up territory? Slate's Jim Newell and Jamelle Bouie discussed this over Slack on Wednesday morning. Jamelle Bouie: So it's the middle of September and depending on where you look, this presidential race is either a toss-up (FiveThirtyEight) or one where Clinton holds a varying lead. Sometimes it ebbs and sometimes it flows. I just looked at the averages, and her average lead varies from plus-2 (RealClearPolitics) to plus-4 (HuffPo). Right now I'd say we are at an ebb for Clinton. Jim Newell: Yeah, I think we're in for a bad wave of polling news for Clinton. The Bloomberg Ohio poll--which gives Trump a five-point lead in that battleground state--is one. (It was taken Friday through Monday, which means that ""basket of deplorables"" and the 9/11 wobble are factored in.) The LA Times tracker poll is mostly useless in terms of the actual numbers, but it does seem to pick up well on meaningful overall trends--Trump's and Clinton's respective convention bumps, for example. And if you look at it the past couple of days, it's blowing up for Trump. No single snapshot should be treated as the way it's going to end, but I do wonder where this bottoms out and where the equilibrium is. I do think that the consensus posture that this race is Clinton's should be ... reconsidered. Bouie: I'd say that the posture that Clinton is guaranteed to win--or that it's not worth focusing on the possibility of a Trump win--is bad. But if someone said, ""All things equal Clinton should be considered a moderate to heavy favorite to win,"" I think that would be right. Which gets to where I think the equilibrium in this race is. Right after Trump won the nomination but before the Democratic primary fight got genuinely ugly, Clinton held a lead of four points. That's where I think things may ultimately fall. Newell: What I'm doing now is white-knuckling my desk until more polls of Pennsylvania come out. Clinton doesn't need Ohio or Florida. If she wins either of those, it's over. But she's maintained real strength in Pennsylvania. I want to see how well that holds up if indeed there's a bad wave coming. What are you looking at most, statewise? Bouie: I guess I'm looking most at Florida. If that begins to decisively move in her favor, that's probably the ballgame. What's a bit hard about this election is that the state polls show competitive races in places like Arizona and Georgia. And if those races are competitive, then Clinton is probably doing decently nationally. I kind of think that, at this moment, we are witnessing a cratering of Democratic enthusiasm. Which is probably why the Obamas will stay on the trail nonstop until November. Newell: We need more Georgia and Arizona numbers, though. Those halcyon days for the HRC campaign, when she was in striking distance in places like Kansas or South Carolina, are now long gone, and the latest figures there have her trailing by double-digits. She was never going to win those states and those polls may have been outliers, but I think the race is starting to look more traditional. Uncomfortably traditional. Also: Trump's favorability numbers seem to be meaningfully improving! He's minus-7 in that Bloomberg poll, and Clinton's minus-17. Are people really buying this relatively more disciplined Trump? Bouie: I honestly have no idea on that score. This might just be Republicans warming up to him. I find it hard to believe that undecided or more marginal voters would conclude now that Trump isn't so bad. But then, this election has reminded me of the degree to which I just don't get some voters. Newell: In sum: Should Clinton supporters, or more generally people who are terrified of a Trump presidency, feel sanguine now or start to sweat? My view is that people who are terrified of a Trump presidency should feel fully terrified at all times, no matter what the polls say, and work from that posture. Bouie: They should feel ... neither? I don't know. I don't see the utility in panicking, although I understand that things are too close for comfort. I just don't think anyone ever felt better after panicking. But if you are worried about Trump winning, go volunteer to do something that makes that possibility less likely. Newell: Yes. Constructive panicking. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/trump_s_campaign_against_clinton_is_an_exercise_in_projection.html	"""She is trigger-happy and very unstable, whether we like it or not, that's what's going on,"" said Donald Trump of Hillary Clinton during a speech on foreign policy last week. She's ""also reckless, so reckless, in fact, that she put her emails on an illegal server that our enemies could easily hack and probably have."" ""Trigger-happy."" ""Unstable."" ""Reckless."" All of this coming from a candidate who recently said this about tensions with Iran: ""With Iran, when they circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats and they make gestures at our people that they shouldn't be allowed to make, they will be shot out of the water."" Trump isn't making an argument about his opponent; he's projecting, and in the race against Clinton, it is a defining aspect of Donald Trump's rhetoric. Rather than challenge the Democratic presidential nominee on substance, Trump takes an approach familiar to anyone who has spent time on an elementary school playground. I know you are, but what am I? Take this response to the hosts of Fox and Friends, from an August discussion of Clinton's email practices: ""Well, look, she's a liar. I mean, she lies. She lied about the email. She lied about Colin Powell. I saw that. He was not happy and it's--the whole thing is a scam with them. Everything is a scam, like grifters."" As with most Trump rhetoric, this is worth a fact-check. Few politicians are completely honest, but compared with her peers, Clinton is less likely to make false statements, as judged by Politifact. And to that point, the FBI investigation of Clinton's private server--as well as documentary evidence such as the correspondence between Clinton and Powell--supports the Democratic nominee's version of events. Trump, put simply, is wrong. But that's not the projection. The projection is the claim that, with Bill and Hillary Clinton, ""Everything is a scam, like grifters."" At present, at least three of Trump's endeavors are under investigation or serious scrutiny--Trump University, Trump Institute, and the Trump Foundation. All of them have the makings of scams, from dishonest business practices to the use of ostensibly charitable dollars for personal expenses. And this doesn't include Trump's real estate career, rife with stories of exploitation, wage theft, and borderline fraud. Trump has projected more than just behavior onto his opponent; he's projected his entire approach to politics. After Clinton detailed Trump's ties to white nationalists and other hate groups, Trump gave a response, essentially turning her claim on its head. ""She is a bigot because you look at what's happening to the inner cities, you look at what's happening to African Americans and Hispanics in this country where she talks all the time,"" Trump said to CNN's Anderson Cooper. Asked if he thinks Clinton is ""personally"" prejudiced, Trump replied: ""Well, she is, of course she is. Her policies--they're her policies, she comes out with the policies and others that believe like she does also. ... This is over the years, a long time. She's totally bigoted, there's no question about that."" Keep in mind that this comes from a candidate who began his campaigns suggesting that some number of Mexican immigrants were ""rapists,"" whose signature policies are a wall on the Mexican border and a ban on Muslim immigration, and whose ""outreach"" to black voters involves grossly exaggerated depictions of black life that rely on racist tropes about black criminality. One especially egregious instance of this projection came on Monday, during a rally in Asheville, North Carolina. Responding to Clinton's claim that ""half of Trump supporters"" are in a ""basket of deplorables,"" the Republican presidential nominee said this:"	"""Unstable,"" ""Bigoted,"" ""Grifter.""

8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/clinton_trump_and_the_issue_of_false_balance.html	"In her latest column, New York Times public editor Liz Spayd discussed the threat of ""false balance"" in media coverage of this year's presidential election, and the accusations that the paper engages in it. False balance, or false equivalence, is generally understood in this year's campaign to mean the practice of journalists, in Spayd's words, ""unfairly equating a minor failing of Hillary Clinton's to a major failing of Donald Trump's."" In a recent Trumpcast, Slate's Jacob Weisberg (who is quoted in Spayd's piece) and Michelle Goldberg discussed the issue of false balance and the challenges journalists face in covering Clinton aggressively but fairly in the age of Trump. Here's an excerpt from their conversation, which took place amid reporting on the Trump Foundation's $25,000 contribution to Florida attorney general Pam Bondi just before she decided not to launch an investigation into Trump University: Jacob Weisberg: So I was on CNN's Reliable Sources over the weekend, talking about whether Trump is the beneficiary of false equivalence. Does the media inflate issues and scandals about Hillary Clinton and grade Trump on a curve, to try to seem fair and make the race closer? Well, duh, yes. That's what the press does! Can you say Corey Lewandowski? Anyhow, when Brian [Stelter] asked me what I thought, I said the problem was that the usual structure of campaign coverage was an apple versus an orange. You know, they're both fruits, they're both different, take your pick. And the problem was that this one, is sort of like an apple versus rancid meat. And that the press didn't really have a way of pointing that out while still being fair. Michelle Goldberg: I mean it's amazing that after many days of the appearance-of-impropriety stories about Hillary Clinton, or stories about something the Clinton Foundation did that quote-unquote raises questions, here we have something that looks a lot like a genuine quid pro quo [the Pam Bondi contribution story]. And I think when you look at how the two of them are covered, it seems like their misdeeds just sort of expand to fit the available space, but the space is kind of the same with both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, so you just get a lot more things competing for attention on his side. And with Clinton you just have a couple of things occurring over and over again because there's kind of nothing else to compete with them. Weisberg: One thing a thousand times versus a thousand things one time. But I mean, talk about diabolical brilliance, I mean, to have a new scandal every seven hours ensures that no scandal will go very deep because it's just gonna be, you turn the page and you're on to the next one. How do you not have a double standard but be fair as a reporter in this campaign? I mean, I was sort of thinking over the weekend, there are real investigative stories to do about the Clinton Foundation. There's some sleaziness around the Clinton Foundation. Adam Davidson was describing on the Political Gabfest a couple of weeks ago how he participated in this Clinton global summit event, and the whole thing just felt gross. There was all this sort of sleaziness about it. My feeling is, look, we don't have that luxury right now. In a normal campaign, you would focus on it. Here, it's beside the point because you have another candidate who is massively sleazy and corrupt and awful and dangerous in every way, that who cares about the little Clinton Foundation scandal. But the press can't--the kind of neutral press kind of can't do that. Goldberg: Right, especially if you're on the Clinton beat, you're on the Clinton beat. And you have to kind of go chase these leads wherever they take you. And that seems perfectly legitimate. I think where I wish there was more self-reflection, is not that they should go easy on Hillary Clinton because she's running against this diabolical lunatic, but just--that they should just be conscious of not repeating the same kind of mistakes that always seem to dog coverage of the Clintons, which is, getting into this dynamic where any hint of impropriety is blown up out of all proportion. The Clintons react by shutting down and becoming really paranoid and secretive. And then that secretiveness is itself taken as further confirmation of wrongdoing. So you have these huge, kind of pseudo-scandals that, when you actually deconstruct them, there's nothing at the center of them. I mean, that was Whitewater, that's been so many of the Clinton scandals. And it seems like a lot of that is the foundation. There's a lot of raising questions, there's a lot of appearance of impropriety, but when you dig down to it, there's never any there there. And with so much at stake in this election, you know, go after Hillary Clinton for things that are fair, but it seems like they should be being extra careful about this sort of habitual pattern that straight journalists fall into when covering the Clintons. Weisberg: Well, with the Clinton Foundation, I think if you really look into it, you'll find mismanagement, you'll find conflict of interest, you'll find a lot of stuff that is deplorable. Goldberg: I mean, what mismanagement? Didn't they get an A from what is the big charity-rating agency? [Editor's note: Charity Watch gave it an A.] They're rated higher than the Red Cross in terms of their actual functioning as a charity. Weisberg: They've done a tremendous amount of good, and they support good causes. But anyway, I'm just sort of positing that there's something there. And then you have on the Trump side, you know trying to corrupt the attorney general of Florida, an actual kind of quid pro quo corruption scandal, if you are the AP or some press organization doing your best to be fair. What should you do? Should you give every one of these things kind of a 1-to-10 rating and do the Trump 9s before you get to the Clinton 3s and 4s? I mean what's a fair way to cover them both? Goldberg: God, I mean, I don't know. Do you know? It seems like on the one hand, the very structure of even the physical product of a newspaper, or the kind of physical length of a newscast mitigates against the proper proportions. You know what I mean? You can't have 20 articles about Trump's misdeeds for every one article about Clinton's, or 20 articles about Trump's things that disqualify him for every one article raising questions about Clinton's record. But the disproportion between the two candidates would suggest that that's what a kind of properly weighted investigation of both of them would look like. Weisberg: The structure of coverage is that there are two choices to be made, and they're not the same, but generally they're both valid choices. Goldberg: Right, and this is one of the reasons Donald Trump is such a challenge. He's kind of like an epistemological challenge. By its very nature, the Republican nominee for president, you don't have a way to treat that as not being a valid choice. Weisberg: Exactly. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	How to Cover Hillary Clinton Aggressively in the Age of Trump
9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/trump_s_basket_of_deplorables_hillary_clinton_was_right.html	"On the eve of the election, Slate's revisiting our best stories from the campaign. How did we get here? Read on. On Friday, offering remarks at a fundraiser in Manhattan, Hillary Clinton gave her view of Donald Trump's supporters and caused a scandal by telling the truth. ""To just be grossly generalistic,"" said Clinton, ""you could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic--you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up."" She continued: ""But the other basket--and I know this because I see friends from all over America here ... but that other basket are people who feel that the government has let them down, the economy has let them down, nobody cares about them, nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures--they're just desperate for change. Those are people we have to understand and empathize with as well."" Some members of the political press were swift with their judgment. ""No. 1 rule of presidential politics. Okay to mock your opponent. Never a good idea to mock the electorate,"" said Michael Barbaro of the New York Times on Twitter. ""Any more appropriate place for Clinton to make her 'basket of deplorables' comment than at a fundraiser with Barbra Streisand?"" asked Aaron Blake of the Washington Post. ""Memo to candidates: Stop generalizing and psychoanalyzing your opponents' supporters. It never works out well for you,"" wrote Domenico Montanaro of NPR. Most of this amounts to theater criticism--an analysis of how the remarks look, how they might play with a broader audience. In his take on Clinton's riff, Montanaro at least begins to broach this question of whether any of it was true. ""There's no data to support such a specific number,"" he wrote, taking issue with Clinton's view that ""half"" of Trump's supporters fall into a ""basket of deplorables."" And in her response to the criticism, Clinton walked back from that number. ""Last night I was 'grossly generalistic,' and that's never a good idea. I regret saying 'half'--that was wrong,"" she said in a statement from the campaign. But ""half"" wasn't wrong. ""Half"" wasn't a gross generalization at all. ""Half"" was by all indications close to the truth. When pollsters and researchers want to measure racial bias, they don't ask if respondents are ""racist""; the stigma of being a racist is strong enough that most people won't answer honestly, to say nothing of the fact that racial prejudice exists on a continuum. A binary answer doesn't capture the complexity of bias and bigotry. Instead, they ask proxy questions that try to capture attitudes associated with racism. One such question--asked in multiple surveys by Public Policy Polling, a Democratic polling firm--is whether respondents believe President Obama was born in the United States and whether they believe he's a Muslim. These questions begin to scratch the surface of racial bias. And what are the results? In one survey, two-thirds of Republicans with a favorable opinion of Donald Trump said that Obama is a Muslim, and 59 percent said he wasn't born in the United States. There's other data too. In June, Reuters measured the racial attitudes of Clinton, Trump, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich supporters. A significant number of supporters for each candidate voiced negative attitudes about black Americans. But Trump backers stood out in their animus. Nearly 50 percent said blacks were ""more violent"" than whites; almost as many said that blacks were ""more criminal than whites."" More than 40 percent said that blacks were ""more rude"" than whites, and more than 30 percent said that blacks were ""lazier"" than whites. Perhaps the best data on questions of race and Trump comes from political scientist Jason McDaniel of San Francisco State University and Sean McElwee, a research associate at Demos, a left-leaning think tank. Using the 2016 pilot of the American National Election Study, conducted in January, they drill down on racial attitudes among Trump supporters. Given what we already know, their results shouldn't come as a shock. More than 40 percent of all Republicans and more than 60 percent of Trump supporters say that Barack Obama is a Muslim. Compared with those who backed other candidates in the GOP primary, Trump supporters have cooler feelings toward blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, and LGBTQ Americans, and warmer feelings toward whites. By sizable margins, according to McElwee's analysis of ANES, Trump supporters are more likely than non-Trump supporters to believe that blacks, Hispanics, and Muslims are lazier and more violent than whites. More than 60 percent of Trump supporters believe black people are more violent than whites; nearly 50 percent of non-Trump Republicans say this. More than 70 percent of Trump supporters believe Muslim people are more violent than whites; roughly 60 percent of non-Trump Republicans say this. These are deplorable views, and they represent the consensus opinion not just of Trump supporters but of all Republicans in the survey. If the study is at all reflective of the population at large on this score, we're going to need a bigger basket. Despite this readily available information, many reporters and pundits are still skeptical that any large number of Americans could hold explicitly racist views. ""Saying racists are racists isn't bigoted. Calling a quarter of the country racist is [obviously] discriminatory,"" tweeted Josh Kraushaar of National Journal, overstating the percentage of Trump backers in the general population. (In the RealClearPolitics average of the presidential race, Trump takes support from 42.9 percent of registered or likely voters. Half of that, given more than 146 million registered voters, is about 31 million people--right around 13 percent of all voting-age adults.) We can debate whether this is blindness or denial, but the data is clear: Large numbers of white Americans hold anti-black or racially resentful views, and for a substantial portion, those views are politically salient. They drive decisions about voting and party identification. Donald Trump did not win the Republican presidential primary because he out-organized or out-campaigned his competitors; he won because he played directly to those views, and Republican elites refused to challenge him. Which gets to a larger truth: The Republican Party of the Obama years is an ethno-nationalist formation of white Americans. The ideological conservatism of its elites is less important than the raw resentment of its base. Trump has harnessed that and given voice to more virulent forms, to the point where key members of his campaign share neo-Nazi memes on social media. The dismay over Clinton's comments--the insistence that it represents some kind of insult and not a statement of truth--reflects the degree to which many of our reporters and observers still shy away from these facts. But this moment demands clarity. Readers don't need to know whether Clinton made a ""gaffe."" They need to know whether she was right. Do millions of Americans hold explicitly racist views? Yes. Do roughly half of Donald Trump's supporters fall into a so-called ""basket of deplorables?"" Yes. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/why_donald_trump_loves_vladimir_putin.html	"Donald Trump admires authoritarians. It's one of the clearest and most consistent lines in his rhetoric and thought. In a 1990 interview with Playboy, he praised the Chinese government for its handling of the student protesters at Tiananmen Square, a massacre that claimed at least hundreds of lives. ""They put it down with strength,"" said Trump. ""That shows you the power of strength. Our country is right now perceived as weak."" Even as he runs for president of the United States--a liberal democracy of individual rights and constitutional government--Trump can't hide how impressed he is with dictators. ""He was a bad guy, really bad guy. But you know what he did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so good,"" said Trump of the late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein during a July campaign event in Raleigh, North Carolina. ""They didn't read them the rights,"" he continued. ""They didn't talk, they were a terrorist, it was over."" Likewise, in January, Trump expressed respect for North Korea's Kim Jong-un. ""[Y]ou have to give him credit,"" he said, while granting that the dictator was a ""maniac."" ""How many young guys--he was like 26 or 25 when his father died--take over these tough generals, and all of a sudden--you know, it's pretty amazing when you think of it. How does he do that? Even though it is a culture and it's a cultural thing, he goes in, he takes over, and he's the boss. It's incredible. He wiped out the uncle. He wiped out this one, that one. I mean, this guy doesn't play games."" But of all the world's authoritarians, Trump has had the most to say about Vladimir Putin, whom he respects as a strong leader. Stronger, in fact, than President Obama. ""I've already said, he is really very much of a leader. I mean, you can say, oh, isn't that a terrible thing--the man has very strong control over a country,"" said Trump this week at NBC News' forum on national security. ""Now, it's a very different system, and I don't happen to like the system. But certainly, in that system, he's been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader."" (It is worth a moment here to say that, by any reasonable measure, Putin has been a failure for Russia, which is mired in international conflicts, struggling with a stagnant, failing economy; repression; and corruption.). We don't have a firm answer to why Trump is so taken with authoritarians. At most, we know that he is preoccupied with dominance and ""strength,"" is obsessed with opulence and projected wealth, and sees life as a contest defined by ""winners"" and ""losers."" But this edges into speculation and amateur psychoanalysis. What we can say for certain is that Trump's personal admiration for Putin, at least, sits side by side with his material ties to Putin and assorted Russian oligarchs, from former campaign manager Paul Manafort--who worked to elect a Putin ally in Ukraine--to the strong evidence that Trump's businesses received substantial funding from Russian elites. Still, you don't need to spin a web of connections between the Trump campaign and Vladimir Putin to get why Trump sees some advantage in praising the latter. To start, there's already a language of Putin admiration on the mainstream right, where the Russian president is contrasted as a supposedly masculine alternative to the presumably effete Barack Obama. Take Sarah Palin's slam from a few years ago. ""Look, people are looking at Putin as one who wrestles bears and drills for oil. They look at our president as one who wears mom jeans and equivocates and bloviates."" From there, it is just a short step to the more aggressive Trump campaign admiration of Putin, especially with Trump's relationship to white nationalism. Trump and his team swim in the fever swamps of the racist right. Trump's ""campaign CEO,"" Stephen Bannon, ran a website that acts as a haven for the youngest generation of white supremacists. Trump's oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., often tweets and retweets voices from the conspiratorial and white nationalist right, voicing a hard line on undocumented immigrants and the Muslim ban. Within those fever swamps, there is real admiration for Putin as a ""defender"" of ""Western civilization"" against Muslims and multiculturalism. It's no coincidence that Trump's counterpart in anti-immigrant demagoguery, Nigel Farage of the U.K. Independence Party, also praises Putin as a talented ""operator."" When you place Trump and his long admiration for authoritarian leaders into the current of modern-day white nationalism and far-right thinking, you end up with what we've seen from his campaign--outright praise for a figure who siphons national resources for personal gain, jails dissidents, and is linked to the murder of journalists. Trump's praise for Putin raises important questions about what, exactly, the Republican presidential nominee means when he says ""Make America Great Again."" Under Vladimir Putin, Russia has slid toward right-wing autocracy, with crackdowns on key political liberties. In recent years, Putin's eye has turned toward ethnic and religious minorities--as well as the Russian LGBTQ community--as a scapegoat for declining economic fortunes and unsuccessful wars. With Trump's attacks on immigrants and Muslims, his belligerence, and his long history of poor management and aggressive scapegoating, it seems that this is what we can look forward to under a Trump administration: a ""great"" America, under a new regime of kleptocratic authoritarian nationalism.

I believe I have the skill and ability to lead this nation. I believe I am the person who is the most qualified for this job, and if I win, I'll treat the task with the respect it deserves and the seriousness it requires. This is one reason we have presidential debates. We need to see, for ourselves, that the nominees have prepared for the White House; that they are diligent and dedicated and ready to shoulder the responsibility of the office. Wednesday's Commander-in-Chief Forum--hosted by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, Matt Lauer, and NBC News--wasn't a debate, but it carried the same weight. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump would sit down to discuss foreign policy, the military, and veterans issues, demonstrating their interest and expertise. Clinton has had better nights, if only because she's still answering questions about her email. ""First of all, as I have said repeatedly, it was a mistake to have a personal account. I would certainly not do it again. I make no excuses for it. It was something that should not have been done,"" she said in response to Lauer, who opened the forum with eight minutes of prodding on her use of a private email server. Audience members also pressed her on the issue: ""Secretary Clinton, how can you expect those such as myself who were and are entrusted with America's most sensitive information to have any confidence in your leadership as president when you clearly corrupted our national security?"" asked one veteran. Clinton gave an able answer, but at this point, there's no upside to the discussion. The email exchange set the tone for Clinton's time onstage. Under aggressive questioning from Lauer and the audience of service members and veterans, the former secretary of state defended her ability to handle classified information, answered for her vote for the war in Iraq, explained her push to intervene in Libya, and gave a detailed sketch of her plans to help those who serve or have served in America's armed forces. This was a typical exchange:"	Donald Trump's Proud Ignorance Reveals His Contempt for the Presidency and His Supporters

Serious conservative constitutionalist freedom-enhancing solutions, and adult governance: That's what's they'll want you to remember about this September. And they'll get to that, right after punching some refugees. It's the first week after Labor Day, and our autumnal rites are upon us. The school year restarts, swimming pools close up for the season, football resumes, and the U.S. Congress returns to pass a short-term continuing resolution before government funding expires only to be stymied by a bloc of conservative House members who have the leverage to disrupt their chamber temporarily but not really get anything passed into law. The smell of apple cider is in the air, or not. When House Speaker Paul Ryan assumed his role last fall, he pledged a return to regular order, which meant in part the timely consideration and passage of 12 individual appropriations bills. This was to be in contrast to the usual state of affairs the past few years, in which Congress would buy more time at the end of the fiscal year via a temporary funding measure that runs into December to complete appropriations bills, pack them all into one large ""omnibus"" spending bill, and then jam through the whole trillion-dollar-plus package while members are itching to fly home for the holidays. Here we are, almost one year into Ryan's speakership, which has afforded him full rein over the FY 2017 funding process. What's the goal? It's to pass a temporary funding measure that runs into December and then jam through an omnibus funding deal in the lame-duck session. It is what it is, and what it is is an election year. It's also precisely what John Boehner, or anyone else with this responsibility, would be doing if he were in charge. The House Freedom Caucus--the group of 40 or so conservatives behind Boehner's ouster who have the numbers to defeat bills from the Republican leadership--is calling for a longer funding extension into 2017 that would allow the next president and Congress to fund the government. They're probably not going to get that and erase a year's worth of appropriators' work. And though they fancy playing government shutdown chicken, they're not likely to pull that stuff a month before the election. They need some sort of face-saving sop from leadership so Freedom Caucus members can show they ""got something."" So what could that sop be? Politico reports that it may involve some good old-fashioned refugee fearmongering. The Freedom Caucus is ""planning to tell leadership they will back a short-term funding package if they can tuck in a bill by Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.) to stop the resettlement program until the administration 'can assure no terrorists or individuals with radical sympathies or views will be admitted,' according to a summary of the bill,"" Politico reports. That bill would be the American Security Against Foreign Enemies (SAFE) Act, introduced last year in the chaos following the Paris attacks. It passed the House of Representatives, with a decent number of Democratic votes, before being killed by Senate Democrats. As I wrote last year, the bill cleverly masks what's effectively a total freeze on Syrian or Iraqi refugee resettlement as another layer of vetting. It's not evidence-based. It's demagogic. It's Trumpish in its essence. No House Republicans voted against it, and if it's attached to this temporary spending bill, then I doubt any Republicans will vote against it this time, either. (It would then either be blocked in the Senate or vetoed, and we'd be back to the drawing board, so whatever.) Remember this moment. House conservatives are considering whether to make this their big ask on a must-pass spending bill. Remember this the next time someone on the right tries to say Trump's nomination was an anomaly. Though Freedom Caucus members mostly support Trump now, thanks to constituent pressure and hatred of Clinton, they expressed their reservations about doing so earlier in the year. ""A lot of us are really nervous,"" Arizona Rep. Matt Salmon told Talking Points Memo in March. ""We feel Obama's a tyrant. A lot of people are worried about trading their tyrant for our tyrant."" Colorado Rep. Ken Buck explained that ""[w]e want to create economic opportunity for people, and Trump has been more vicious in his language than any of the other Republican candidates when it comes to demeaning people."" Arizona Rep. Trent Franks said, ""I have been asked on many occasions what I would do if this race comes down to a one on one contest between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton. Each time, I have responded that as a conservative, I cannot trust Mr. Trump to do the right thing."" These figures largely classified themselves as Sen. Ted Cruz-type constitutional movement conservatives, rather than Trumpish nationalists. But Cruz himself, back when he was drafting off Trump, called for a religious test as part of the refugee vetting process. And earlier this year, he called for both a freeze on Syrian refugee resettlement and the ""need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized."" The reason these Republicans got behind such measures is that they rate highly with their most vocal constituents, whose fear is readily harnessed into political energy. All of this has made it, and continues to make it, quite difficult to believe these conservatives when they distance themselves from Trump's most bigoted proposals, such as the Muslim ban. Trump is just tapping into the same energy source with more efficiency. Responding to terrorist attacks that Syrian refugees have not committed with an effective ban on their resettlement is not brilliant, responsible constitutionalist conservative policymaking. It's demagoguery from a party that's feasted on it since well before Donald Trump converted it into a presidential nomination. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/trump_clinton_is_defined_by_an_educational_gap_among_white_voters.html	"The presidential race is tightening, and now at least one nonludicrous pollster has shown Donald Trump to be in the lead. A national survey from CNN/ORC released Tuesday, and conducted Sept. 1-4, shows Trump leading Clinton by 2 percentage points, 45 to 43, among likely voters in a four-way race. (Among registered voters, Clinton leads 44 to 41.) The poll shows Trump's favorability rating and support from independents improving, and his support among Republicans consolidating. It is just one poll. An NBC News/Survey Monkey poll also released Tuesday shows Clinton leading by 4 percentage points, while her list of battleground paths to 270 is significantly longer than Donald Trump's. The race may revert to a blowout, but it's probably going to be closer than the Clinton partisans who were calling ""LANDSLIDE!"" a couple of weeks ago would care to acknowledge. President Obama beat Mitt Romney by 4 percentage points nationally in 2012. Sounds about right. And beyond that, the margins among broad racial demographics will look roughly the same as what they were in 2012. Clinton will win black, Hispanic, and Asian voters by astounding margins. Trump will carry white voters comfortably. It's the makeup of which white voters go to whom, though, that makes this election something new entirely. The hinge point in this election is education levels among white voters. In 2012, according to exit polls, Romney won whites overall, with 59 percent to Obama's 39 percent. Education levels didn't make much of a difference: Romney won 61 percent of noncollege whites and 56 percent of college-educated whites. Now look at the CNN/ORC poll, which, caveats aside, shows what a winning Trump coalition would look like. Like Romney, Trump is winning whites by about 20 percentage points, 54 to 33 percent, and he's in the teens among nonwhite voters. Look under the hood a little more, though, and that breakdown of white voters is split. Trump has 66 percent of whites without college degrees to Hillary Clinton's 23 percent. Meanwhile, Clinton leads among white college graduates, 49 percent to 35 percent. Democrats haven't won white college graduates in decades--not even in their 1964 landslide!--and here Clinton is poised to take them comfortably ... while losing noncollege whites by an absolutely disastrous 43 percentage points. The gap between Romney's support from college-educated whites and noncollege whites was 5 percentage points. It is now, in this poll, 31 points. Overall, according to 2012 exits, Obama won college graduates by 2 percentage points, 50 to 48 percent, and nongraduates by 4 percentage points, 51 to 47. According to this poll, Clinton is leading among college graduates by 27 percentage points, 56 to 29 percent and losing among nongraduates by 15 percent points, 36 to 51 percent. This, right here, is the election. And it puts campaign strategies in a useful frame of reference heading into the post-Labor Day stretch. Donald Trump, for example, has to continue cranking out red meat that appeals to his white working-class base while trying to stop the bleeding among white college graduates. This is why he gave a harshly anti-immigration speech last week but also took the time for photo-ops with a world leader and black people--not out of some newfound ecumenism and broad-mindedness, but because he wanted to give college-educated whites a reason to believe he is something other than an insane bigot. There's no way of knowing right now how permanent any of the coalitional shifts marking this election will be. But it's troubling to think about which lessons the winning party draws from an election split along lines like this. If Hillary Clinton wins pretty much entirely without noncollege whites, Democrats might get the idea that they can now win presidential elections pretty much entirely without noncollege whites. That would continue to hurt the party in midterm elections if there's no cyclical messaging adjustment. More importantly: Noncollege whites are Americans who, like everyone else, deserve targeted answers for their problems beyond the blustery affect Donald Trump is using, successfully, to lure them. If Donald Trump wins without minorities or college-educated whites, meanwhile, Republicans might get the idea that they can now win the White House by continuing the same crazy, narrowly targeted routine that's worked for them in midterms. Here the casualty would be responsible governance. It's not a sign of a healthy republic when the college-educated and the unmatriculated have such starkly different views about the future of the country, but here we are. And whatever the outcome in November, the winner will feel confirmed in its own most pain-free assumptions about how best to carve up the electorate. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	The Surprising Split in the Electorate That Has Come to Define Trump-Clinton
14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/how_trump_made_a_fool_out_of_mexico.html	"This article is part of a series published in cooperation with the Mexican magazine Letras Libres. It was a theatrical work with two simultaneous performances. One was staged against the scenery of the American campaign for president; the other unfolded within the Mexican political arena. There were two actors: candidate Donald Trump and President Enrique Pena Nieto. Trump was trying to soften his image with undecided American voters and perhaps persuade some Latino Americans to support him, to see him as presidential and friendly toward Mexicans, all without alienating his committed followers and all while not yielding an inch on his wall and deportation agenda. Pena Nieto, more unpopular in his country than Trump is in his, was trying to ""protect"" Mexicans in Mexico itself and in the United States. There was only one winner, Donald Trump, and one loser, Pena Nieto. Or, more precisely, Pena Nieto and the people of Mexico. Trump calls himself a great negotiator. On this particular occasion, he was. He chose the moment, the script, the terminology, even the questions. And, as usual, falsehood and fakery were his weapons. He spent 10 hours with Mexico (including his flight time) and secured the appearance of support from the country's president (not explicit but, for Trump, usefully symbolic). Having fitted himself for a halo as a friend of Mexico, Trump could then return to euphorically address his faithful supporters in Arizona, reiterating word for word his racist and anti-immigrant proposals, beginning with the construction of ""a big, fat, beautiful wall"" that Mexico will pay for. After all, hadn't he just shaken hands, that very afternoon, with his ""friend,"" the president of Mexico? Pena Nieto, onstage with Trump, delivered a sober speech about commerce and emigration, a factual discourse that neither convinced nor made a minimal emotional impression on Trump, who is a post-factual politician. For him, objective truth does not exist. Truth for him is whatever he happens to be saying at that particular moment. Pena Nieto should have demanded a public apology for Trump's insults against Mexico and Mexicans, for his repeatedly characterizing us as rapists and criminals. Not only did the elected president of Mexico fail to do so, but he referred to Trump's ignorant allegations as ""misunderstandings"" due to differences of ""perception."" Pena Nieto should have publicly expressed his absolute refusal to pay for Trump's absurd wall. In a tweet after the fact--fortunately picked up by the American press--Pena Nieto stated that he had, at the beginning of Trump's visit, told him in private that Mexico would never pay for a wall. (A revelation of yet another one of Trump's endless lies, since he claimed in their joint appearance afterward that there had been no discussion at all of how his pet wall would be financed.) But why did the Mexican president not bravely affirm his position in public? And why did he agree to this meeting at all, on the day before the presidential informe (a state-of-the country address), delivered on Sept. 1 , a key date in Mexico going back to 1917. Why did he have to schedule this meeting in the afternoon preceding Trump's anti-immigrant tirade in Arizona? We Mexicans are raised to value a kind of public courtesy, often pro forma and sometimes florid, surely the genesis of a statement like Pena Nieto's calling Trump a friend. Did he really think that traditional (in this case banal) Mexican courtesy would soften Trump's message directed at the most bigoted of his supporters? Trump came to Mexico to offer some supposedly laudatory words about we Mexicans whom he has spent his whole campaign insulting. Now we were ""tremendous people."" And in exchange for these miserable crumbs of vacuous content, he was given a presidential treatment, incidentally alienating Hillary Clinton, a candidate who does understand and respect Mexico, who in her phrase wants to build bridges not walls (and whose husband literally saved Mexico from bankruptcy in 1995). Donald Trump is a sociopath drunk on himself. His religion is hatred. His god is Donald Trump. He is also addicted to empty adjectives. He is not a man of his word or of words as markers of truth. If he wins the presidency (which seems improbable), the Mexican government will have to weigh the dimensions of this historic error, widely denounced in Mexico all across the political spectrum. From Trump, Mexico received only words, words worth no more than the paper they were scribbled on. In exchange, Mexico, filling the sad role of the useful idiot, gave a bigot the pat on the back that he required. Translated by Hank Heifetz"	How Trump Made a Fool out of Mexico
15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/09/how_to_beat_trump_in_a_debate.html	"Successfully debating Donald Trump is the hardest thing that should be an easy thing in our world today, right up there with beating Donald Trump in an election with adult voters. In debate after debate after debate during the Republican primaries, Trump showed little understanding of or curiosity about public policy, instigated childish fights with his rivals, and disappeared from the conversation altogether when it bored him. He skipped one debate because he didn't like Fox News' sass. In another that he did attend, he bragged about the size of his penis. Never forget that he bragged about the size of his penis in a debate among candidates vying for the United States presidency. And never forget that, either in spite or because of all this, he won the Republican nomination for said presidency and is now polling neck-and-neck with his Democratic competitor, Hillary Clinton. During the primaries Trump was able to get away with being his unvarnished self. In creating his primary plurality, he hardened for himself a national majority in opposition to him. The gains he's seen in polling during September have come from both Clinton missteps and a more disciplined operation under new Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who has tamed her candidate's feral impulses at the margins. There are even murmurs that Trump is preparing for Monday's first debate at Hofstra University, which might have less to do with his domestication than with the fact that he is about to go in front of the biggest television audience he's ever had. What keeps the Clinton campaign awake at night must be the possibility of Trump passing through this first debate with a calm and poise for which he is not known. The Trump campaign's hope is to trick people, white-collar white people in particular, into believing that he is indeed calm and poised. Once Trump is onstage and under duress, though, he will be tempted to revert to his nature. Clinton's goal will be to induce such behavior--to coax out the real Trump, the one who ""won"" in the primary by losing the majority of the country. Here's how she can do that. Ask him to explain pretty much anything. The large Republican primary field didn't just help Trump by allowing him to cruise to early victories with relatively modest pluralities. It also helped him in the minute-to-minute unfolding of the early debates. He could get in his insults against Jeb Bush or Rand Paul or some other foil, and then, as the conversation--as it occasionally did--ventured into more substantive policy grounds, he could go into hiding for tens of minutes at a time as, say, Paul and Chris Christie argued about surveillance programs or medical marijuana. The stage will be smaller Monday night, as Trump competes in the first one-on-one presidential debate of his life. There will be no hiding. It's not necessarily in Clinton's interest to turn this into a patronizing quiz show. Voters don't cast their ballots based on which candidates best trill the rhotic consonants in foreign leaders' names. But there are things that people expect their presidents to know, and on this count Trump tripped up a few times during the primary debates. In the Dec. 15 debate held in Las Vegas, CNN guest questioner Hugh Hewitt asked Trump which element of the aging nuclear triad he felt was most urgently in need of an upgrade. Trump's response was a jumble of nonsense about Iraq and Syria that made clear he had never heard the term, which refers to land-, air-, or sea-based systems for delivering nuclear weapons. That's not great. But it's deeper than terminology: It was clear that he had never considered the question of nuclear arsenal maintenance. He did, however, say that, ""I think, for me, nuclear is just the power, the devastation, is very important to me."" Indeed, big bomb go boom. Trump is running strongly against the Trans-Pacific Partnership. (Hillary Clinton claims to be against TPP, too, though no one really believes her.) When asked for even modest details of the trade pact, though, Trump tends to stumble. In the Nov. 10 debate, Trump went on about how ""It's a deal that was designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door, and totally take advantage of everyone."" For all of the trade deal's opacity and complexity, it is indeed not ""designed"" to allow China to do that. It is designed to corner China into reforming its economy. Rand Paul chimed in after Trump's spiel to point out that China is not a signatory to the deal, and Trump had little to say in response. The next day Trump and his team retrofitted their version of the exchange to make it sound as if he knew exactly what he was saying and what he meant. This explanation, too, was lacking. Clinton doesn't need Trump to name the presidents and prime ministers of foreign countries. What she--or the moderators--could do, though, is ask him to explain the details of any of the policy proposals other people have written up on his behalf. How many weeks of paid leave are offered in Trump's child care plans? Who would and wouldn't be covered? Trump could be asked the cost of either his tax or education plan. Even better: What are his tax and education plans? One of the most effective versions of this model in the primary was when Sen. Marco Rubio, during the Feb. 25 debate, asked Trump to explain his health care plan. This is where Trump went on about ""the lines,"" referring to selling insurance across state lines, but had little else to offer beyond repetition. Clinton doesn't just need to ask him about his own plans. She could ask him to explain anything. How does Medicaid work and how would he change it? What does he dislike most about the Iranian nuclear deal? What's the latest from Syria? Don't wander too far in the weeds, but try to find some way to get him to move past the few superficialities he'll have memorized. Remember: Trump does not know what he's talking about. Ever. This fact gets obscured from time to time whenever we start talking about Trump pivots and message discipline and the like, as if the problem simply were a lack of grace. And we should be careful to avoid the fallacy so common on the left that politics is about knowing more stuff than the other guy. But the simple truth is that Trump does not understand the basic grammar of the job he's seeking. Get him to say something incredibly sexist. An observation: Hillary Clinton has faced sexist criticisms in her career. You may have noticed this. A twin observation: Donald Trump has dished out a lot of sexism in his career. You may have noticed this, too. One dynamic of the debate, then, is whether Trump will be able to stop himself from making some outward expression of his sexism--a remark, a gesture, anything. There was one woman in the field of 16 competitors dispatched by Trump en route to the nomination. Though Carly Fiorina posed little threat, Trump was unable to control himself against her. He was unable, as reported by Rolling Stone, to prevent himself from saying about Fiorina: ""Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!"" This was something that he had to say. Trump did not acquit himself well when that quote was brought up in the (interminably long) Sept. 16 debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. Trump had claimed that by ""face,"" he meant her persona. Moderator Jake Tapper asked Fiorina to respond to it all. With great poise, she said, ""I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said,"" to roaring applause. Trump, to groans, replied: ""I think she's got a beautiful face, and I think she's a beautiful woman."" Fiorina did shoot up in the polls after this debate, before the usual combination of additional scrutiny and unsustainable media oxygen sent her back down to the realm of also-rans. Hillary Clinton has experience in one-on-one debates with male counterparts who express fatally boorish behavior. It will be the test of a lifetime for Trump to make it through one debate without patronizing her similarly; he needs to, though, if he's to recover some of his numbers among suburban college-educated women, the traditionally Republican demographic that Trump has bled from his wherevers. Don't let him. Mention some of his sexist remarks. Maybe he'll keep it together during the debate, and wait until the next day to say something terrible. Draw out his childishness. Trump needs more voters coming out of the debate thinking that he's a properly matured adult, rather than a child. One common trait among children is their inability to manage their passing rages. The proper response here is not for Clinton to respond in kind. She's not a natural heckler, and when people who aren't natural hecklers try to meet Trump on his level, they get mauled. Trump is the only candidate who can pull off his brand of childishness. That's not a compliment. Sen. Ted Cruz, the best debater in the Republican primary field, demonstrated the best way of managing Trump's puerility. It was the Mar. 3 debate. Cruz prodded Trump by bringing up a piece of unwelcome information, in this case the pending lawsuit against Trump University, and how he might be on the stand for a ""fraud trial"" during the general election campaign. This had the instant effect of agitating Trump into sputtering interruption. Cruz was ready."	The Secrets to Beating Trump in a Debate
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/terrorism_doesn_t_help_trump_just_look_at_the_polls.html	"Many supporters of Hillary Clinton fear--and many fans of Donald Trump hope--that a terror attack in the United States, such as those that struck New York, New Jersey, and Minnesota over the weekend, will decide the election. The assumption on both sides is that Trump, as the anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, law-and-order candidate, would benefit. But is that true? Three recent attacks--in Paris on Nov. 13, in San Bernardino, California, on Dec. 2, and in Orlando, Florida, on June 12--have tested this assumption. Trump has not gained ground, and in some ways he has suffered, for several reasons. Here's what the polls show. 1. No freakouts. After Paris, public concern about terrorism rose significantly. In a Quinnipiac University survey taken shortly before the attack, 32 percent of Americans said it was very likely that ""in the near future there will be a terrorist attack in the United States causing large numbers of lives to be lost."" When Quinnipiac repeated that question after Paris, the percentage who said ""very likely"" had climbed to 44 percent. But the subsequent attack in San Bernardino--an actual terror strike in the United States--made little difference. The percentage who said ""very likely"" barely increased, and the overall percentage who expected future attacks marginally declined. In ABC News/Washington Post surveys, the proportion of respondents who said terrorism was their top presidential voting issue also marginally declined. You might also expect such attacks to undermine public confidence in government. But they haven't. In a May 2015 Fox News poll, 65 percent of Americans expressed confidence that intelligence agencies could detect and prevent terror plots against the United States. In December 2015, after Paris and San Bernardino, that number didn't fall. It rose slightly, to 67 percent. Likewise, in a series of Quinnipiac surveys taken before Paris, after Paris, and after San Bernardino, the percentage of Americans who said we were ""losing the fight against ISIS"" steadily declined, from 66 percent to 62 percent to 57 percent. 2. No increase in support for sending troops. In the same sequence of Quinnipiac polls, the percentage of Americans who supported ""sending ground troops to fight ISIS in Iraq and Syria"" held steady and then marginally declined, from 54 percent to 52 percent. In Fox News surveys taken before and after San Bernardino, the percentage who favored sending ""a significant number"" of troops to Iraq and Syria also declined, from 42 percent to 38 percent. 3. No sudden increase in appetite for surveillance. Since the 9/11 attacks, public support for domestic surveillance has risen or fallen in response to threats, such as the rise of ISIS. From the beginning of 2014 to the days just after Paris, there was a big shift from concern about civil liberties to concern that the government should do more to monitor potential terrorists. But San Bernardino had no effect. In Quinnipiac polls taken before and after San Bernardino, the numbers moved slightly the other way, from worry about insufficient protection to worry about civil liberties. 4. Concern about Islam but rejection of Trump's response. Americans slightly prefer Trump's language to President Obama's. In an ABC/Post poll taken shortly after Orlando, 48 percent said leaders should use the term radical Islam in describing such attacks. Only 40 percent chose the alternative answer: that leaders should avoid that phrase ""because it lends legitimacy to terrorists by falsely suggesting that their actions are supported by Islamic teachings."" But Americans don't support Trump's anti-Muslim policies. In a Monmouth University poll taken after the San Bernardino attack, 65 percent opposed ""banning all Muslims from entering the U.S."" After Orlando, that number rose to 70 percent. When the ban is phrased as temporary, opposition is lower, but attacks still don't help Trump. In May, Americans opposed a temporary ban on Muslims, 50 percent to 43 percent. In June, after Orlando, they still opposed it, 52 percent to 43 percent. 5. More fear of radicalization than of refugees. After Paris, polls showed a big drop in Americans' willingness to accept Syrian refugees. San Bernardino had no such effect. In Quinnipiac surveys taken before and after San Bernardino, Americans narrowly shared Trump's reluctance to take refugees, but most said they were more concerned about homegrown jihadists than about refugees or other visitors. Likewise, after Orlando, a Monmouth survey found a shift toward concern about domestic radicalization rather than foreign infiltration. So when Trump responds to such attacks by talking about refugee vetting and Clinton responds by talking about monitoring online radicalization, it's not clear that his message resonates more strongly. 6. No enthusiasm for gun control. The deadly use of guns in Paris, San Bernardino, and Orlando didn't increase support for stricter gun laws. People seem to view these attacks more as terrorism than as crimes involving firearms. In NBC/Journal surveys between October and December 2015--the period of the Paris and San Bernardino attacks--the percentage of Americans who were very worried about being directly hit by a terror attack increased, while the percentage who were very worried about being directly hit by gun violence did not change. In fact, Quinnipiac polls found a loss of support for gun control: Shortly before Paris, Americans favored stricter gun laws by a 7-point margin, but after San Bernardino, they opposed such laws by a 3-point margin. Before Paris, 24 percent said recent mass shootings in the United States made them more likely to purchase a gun. After San Bernardino, that number rose to 33 percent. Economist/YouGov surveys in May and June found no change in support for stricter gun laws after Orlando. 7. Trump is a turnoff. After San Bernardino, Trump proposed his ban on foreign Muslims. After Orlando, he ratcheted up his rhetoric against refugees, immigrants, and American-born Muslims. These responses didn't go over well. After San Bernardino, a Monmouth survey asked: ""Do you think Trump is saying things that need to be said or is he making things worse?"" A plurality, 48 percent to 39 percent, said he was making things worse. In a YouGov survey, Americans approved of Obama's response to the attack in Orlando, and they marginally approved of Clinton's response, but they disapproved of Trump's, 47 percent to 32 percent. In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll taken after Orlando, Clinton trounced Trump on every question: Which candidate did a better job of responding to the attack, which showed a better temperament, which offered the better proposals, and which earned more confidence that he or she could handle such attacks? How do all these factors add up? Do they help either candidate? The best evidence comes from three pollsters who took samples in May, shortly before the Orlando attack, and then in June, shortly afterward. In ABC/Post surveys, Clinton gained ground on the question of which candidate would handle terrorism better, increasing her margin from 3 percentage points to 11. In NBC/Journal surveys, Clinton marginally gained ground on standing up for America, uniting the country, and performance as commander in chief. In Quinnipiac surveys, Clinton gained ground on which candidate was better prepared to be president, but Trump gained ground on other questions: Which candidate was a stronger leader, which was better at handling immigration, which was better at responding to an international crisis, and which was more effective against ISIS? It's hard to tell whether these shifts, even when they overlap with terror attacks, are caused by the attacks. It's equally hard to tell whether other factors, such as Trump's slurs against a Mexican American judge in early June, counteract and mask pro-Trump effects of the attacks. But some combination of factors--unease about war, distaste for Trump's reactions, the irrelevance of refugees, and the public's failure to lose its cool--has limited his ability to capitalize on these incidents. In the wake of this week's attacks, he's likely to fail again. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Terrorism Doesn't Help Trump. Just Look at the Polls.
17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/hillary_makes_her_case_to_millennnials.html	"""Politics can be discouraging,"" Hillary Clinton said in a speech addressed to millennial voters in Philadelphia on Monday. ""This election in particular can be downright depressing sometimes."" It sure can. And for a lot of millennial voters, that's not just because Donald Trump's in the race. Hillary Clinton is running on the most progressive platform in Democratic Party history. And yet the young liberals and Bernie Sanders supporters are far from ready to support her. In four-way polling of late, Clinton's running neck-and-neck with Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson among millennial voters and losing plenty more potential youth votes to Green candidate Jill Stein. This situates her dozens of percentage points behind the pace Obama set among young voters in either of his wins. ""Even if you are totally opposed to Donald Trump,"" she acknowledged today, ""you may still have some questions about me. I get that."" When intra-party reconciliation was the most imminent priority earlier in the summer, the Clinton campaign made a big show of waving around the platform and its proposals on climate change, debt-free college, health reform, criminal justice reform, pay equity, and so on. But with the nomination firmly in grasp, the post-convention target of her persuasions became moderate, suburban Republican-leaners, and the platform seemed to slink back into the archives collecting dust. So it's hard to blame those young Sanders voters for not falling into line. Monday's speech, plus an op-ed in Mic, was in part an effort to tell those voters: Yes, I'm still running on those things, and yes, they're in line with the sorts of policies I've fought for my entire career. But running through this targeted demographic's laundry list isn't enough. It doesn't get to the core of the problem, which is: character, and Clinton as the embodiment of a political insider. It's on this fundamental question of trustworthiness where Clinton faces the steepest climb among young voters. Both she and her team were wise enough to understand that in crafting the speech. A Quinnipiac national poll released last week asked likely voters if they believed Clinton was honest or not. Overall, 32 percent said she was, compared to 65 percent who said she was not. That ugly picture was bad across all age groups, but worst among young voters: Only 21 percent of 18-to-34-year-olds said she was honest, compared to 77 percent who did not. By contrast, 27 percent of those 18 to 34 said Donald Trump was honest. (Which is not to say they all view this as an asset in him.) Another question asked whether Clinton ""bases her policies on a set of core values"" or ""does whatever is politically convenient."" Thirty-nine percent of likely voters overall said ""based on core values,"" but only 25 percent of 18-to-34-year-olds did. Clinton's poll numbers suggest she's outperforming her character numbers among these demographics--i.e., she's still earning the votes of many young people who believe she's wholly dishonest. But she needs to repair this image if she's going to get much further, and there are only 50 days left to do so. It never would have worked for Clinton to come out and promise millennials she's something she's not. She's not a good-government, authentic transparency diehard who promises to cleanse the nation's capital of corruption or transform the system. She's not selling revolution. She's a mainstream Democrat, a liberal with caveats, and she harbors no illusions about changing Washington. Instead what her speech sought to do in its most, dare we say, authentic moment was to persuade young people (and anyone else with the same concerns) of her view: that politics is a slog and always will be, and one that requires the work of both insiders and outsiders working mutually, over lifetimes, to make change. ""I've learned in a democracy,"" she said, ""if you want to help the greatest number of people, you have to push for reform from both the outside in and the inside out. We need activists and advocates, entrepreneurs and innovators, teachers and mentors, people who change lives every day in a million quiet ways."" ""We also need strong principled leaders,"" she continued, ""who can win votes, write laws, allocate resources, and do the slow, hard business of governing."" This is any honest person's acknowledgement of how American politics works, barring the drafting of a new constitution. Activists organize coalitions to push insiders roughly aligned with them into action, and it doesn't happen overnight. You vote for the candidate closest to your views who has a chance of winning and then pressure that person into action. That person then does the best he or she can within the confines of checks-and-balances, and sure, the insider might have to shiv you if the energy or political necessity or emergency priority is elsewhere. This is exactly how Donald Trump, Gary Johnson, Jill Stein, or Hillary Clinton would operate if he or she became that insider, because it's what the office is. Of the four, Clinton is viewed as the least authentic by the voters to whom authenticity is so critical, but she's by far the most honest candidate about the way change happens. Monday's speech was an effort to show these reluctant voters that they mostly share the same policy views--and to shift their understanding of authenticity so that Clinton can make the case that she's one of the most authentic politicians around.

18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/how_trump_played_the_media.html	"On the eve of the election, Slate's revisiting our best stories from the campaign. How did we get here? Read on. It was about 10 minutes in, after two or three introductory speakers and an enthusiastic plug from Donald Trump for his new downtown property, that the cry of Admiral Ackbar began sounding in the core of my being. It's a trap. I'm an extra in a bad commercial. We were sitting in the ballroom of the new downtown property, four blocks down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. Like most of the new downtown property, the color scheme in the room relies heavily on gold, but here the camera-facing portion was dulled to an appropriately muted motif, with a blue backdrop and six American flags near the dais. About half of the ballroom was blocked off for reporters and cameras. So many cameras. The Trump campaign hinted to news organizations that he would be holding a press conference at his new downtown property in Washington, D.C., on Friday morning after delivering a statement. The subject was intended to be some sort of ""major announcement"" about his half-decade-long refusal to say that President Obama was born in the United States. This is the ""issue"" that catapulted Trump to the top of the preliminary 2012 Republican presidential primary polls, before he collapsed and opted not to run. He made this nonsensical, racist argument because, in his words, as recalled by former Mitt Romney personal aide Garrett Jackson, ""rightwing crazies will believe it."" At some point in the past month, some figure in his campaign--presumably new campaign manager Kellyanne Conway--finally got him to understand that he's no longer running in the Republican primary and needs to mitigate his active appeals to racism if he's to recover among suburban whites. Trump has had various surrogates and campaign spokespeople aver that he believes President Obama was born in the United States, but until Friday, he was too proud to admit it himself. Friday's event was his opportunity to fess up, whereupon the press would pepper him with follow-up questions about why he promoted the birther conspiracy in the first place, whether he really sent investigators to Hawaii to look into it and what exactly were the unbelievable things they were finding, why he was saying it Friday when he refused to say it as soon as Thursday, and most importantly, why he spent years following Obama's longform birth certificate reveal in 2011--which a campaign statement sent Thursday evening described as the ""conclusion"" of the episode--still promoting the theories in interviews and on social media. Things went very differently. The press conference proved instead to be Trump's troll of the media, a rick-roll--as everyone called it later--on the grand scale. It was effortlessly brought off and all it required was a manipulation of media incentives and cable news control-room politics, plus a carefully arranged use of space and taxpayer-funded security detail. You can have all your earnest thinkpieces about false balance and the like; Trump's event on Friday was enacted media criticism. Here's how you pull off such a feat, step by step. 1. Wink to news organizations that you're finally going to eat crow on your most prominent political lie of the past six years, in the form of a press conference. They will send all of their cameras and reporters, and they will clear their broadcast schedules for the entire morning. In his Washington Post interview on Thursday,  Trump declined to admit Obama's domestic birth, ""because then everyone is going to be talking about it."" On Friday morning, Trump told Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo that she would have to wait for the press conference to hear the announcement. ""We have to keep the suspense going,"" he said. 2. Hold the event in a ballroom where you've made sure to separate the press filing area from the podium by approximately 10 rows of seating for various lobbyists, operatives, supporters, and--most importantly--veterans. Rope it off. Make veterans and war heroes both the subject of and the speakers at the event, so as to discourage rude intrusions from the press corps during introductory speeches. 3. Make brief introductory comments yourself just to ensure the cameras are rolling. If the introducers had spoken from the beginning without a word from Trump, cable networks might've held their coverage of the event on standby until Trump had taken the microphone. By making a few remarks at the beginning before introducing a couple of supporters, Trump forced the hand of the networks, who let the feed run, surely assuming Trump would get to the meat of the matter after a few minutes. Instead, he just yammered on about his new downtown property before giving way to his compatriots. 4. Allow veterans to sing patriotic hosannas to Trump for roughly 30 minutes, unfiltered, to cable news audiences and other networks live-streaming the event, creating what is effectively a free half-hour infomercial. 5. Now comes the important part: At some point, the networks will get hip to the ruse and decide to cut away. When they do, that's when to jump in and give them what they were waiting for. On Friday, this happened after about a half-hour, with CNN cutting away to the studio and the anchors shamefacedly acknowledging that they'd been had. I am certain the flattering introductions would have continued straight through Election Day if the networks hadn't pulled the plug. They did, and very soon after Trump returned to the podium and got to the point. 6. Declare that Obama was born in the United States, only after reciting a lie about Hillary Clinton. 7. Pretend not to hear the reporters screaming from a good distance back in their cordoned-off pen. I have never seen such a hostile press reaction as what ensued when Trump concluded his remarks and began to walk out. Things had gotten feral. MSNBC's Katy Tur was standing on her chair in the front row screaming questions. 8. Escape to do a tour of the new downtown property with the camera crew pool, but without any producers or reporters in tow. Literally keep the reporters locked inside the ballroom until you're safely away from them while using television cameras to record footage of your new downtown property. Use the Secret Service to bar anyone from using side doors into your new downtown property's atrium, even though it's now supposedly open to the public. Voila. You have successfully played the national media. It was not subtle. It was as subtle as the gold trim on the new downtown property's urinals. This was a Trump initiative, after all. Everyone in that ballroom on Friday knew early on that we were being trolled. Afterward, the networks reportedly held an emergency conference call on which they agreed to erase the camera pool footage of the property tour, since no editorial figure had been allowed to join. It was a small measure of revenge. Meanwhile, in the ballroom, the blue backdrop was collapsing, taking out all but one of the Old Glories in its path. Trump's ruse was physically falling apart, but the man himself was long gone from the room. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	How Donald Trump Played the National Media, in Eight Simple Steps
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/gary_johnson_is_not_worth_any_liberal_s_protest_vote.html	"On the eve of the election, Slate's revisiting our best stories from the campaign. How did we get here? Read on. Do the youngs know anything about Gary Johnson, the Libertarian nominee for president? Recent polls suggest that a good number of them sure seem to like him, or at least consider him a worthy receptacle for a protest vote. And at first glance, it's not hard to see why. Johnson's fun. He's a fun, funny dude. I personally liked him when he was asked about Aleppo and was all, What in the hell are you even talking about? Ha! The exposure probably made it a net-plus for him in the end. He likes #extreme outdoor sports and thinks weed is great. He mostly supports abortion rights, LGBT rights, and rolling back America's global military footprint. He has a responsible adult politician as his running mate. And he's real. America's young people, we're constantly told, value honesty and authenticity. They certainly see Hillary Clinton as inauthentic and dishonest, while Donald Trump, on the other end, is a walking reminder of the wisdom of employing scripts, political calculation, and simple discretion as bulwarks against unleashing one's full self to the public. Gary Johnson? He's just Gary Johnson. There's a lot more to Gary Johnson, though, that these young, liberal voters may want to consider before pulling the lever. First, the polls: In the 2012 election, President Obama won 18- to 29-year-olds by 23 percentage points, 60 to 37 percent, according to exit polls. That was a decline from 2008, when he carried the same cohort by 34 percentage points, but in the same ballpark. The breakdown of the 2016 electorate looks to be roughly the same in some areas--Hispanics, blacks, and Asian Americans are breaking lopsidedly for Clinton, while white men are firmly in Trump's camp--though Clinton is making big gains in college-educated whites, while Trump crushes her in whites without a college degree. But among young voters this cycle, according to recent polls, Clinton is struggling to match those in Obama's two victories. It's not that young voters are going to Donald Trump. He properly repels them. A decent number are going to Green Party candidate Jill Stein, but she's not the major beneficiary, either. It's Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate, who's not only picking up a huge share of young voters, but is actually neck-and-neck with Clinton among them. In the Quinnipiac national poll released Wednesday, Clinton leads Trump among voters ages 18 to 34 by a 21-point margin, 55 to 34 percent. This is in the head-to-head poll, though, where Clinton's overall lead is 5 percentage points. In the four-way poll, Clinton's overall lead over Trump drops to 2 percentage points--and her support among 18- to 34-year-olds collapses by 24 percentage points, to 31 percent. Trump's support among the youngs falls a more modest 8 percentage points, to 26 percent. And sitting right there in the middle is Johnson, earning 29 percent of 18- to 34-years-olds. Stein, meanwhile, comes in fourth with a not-insignificant 15 percent of the 18-to-34 crowd. The story's the same in Thursday's fresh new New York Times/CBS News national poll, in which Clinton and Trump are tied at 42 percent apiece in a four-way race. ""The third-party candidates draw their strongest support from younger voters,"" the Times writes. ""Twenty-six percent of voters ages 18 to 29 say they plan to vote for Mr. Johnson, and another 10 percent back Ms. Stein. A little more than one in five political independents say they will vote for one of the third-party candidates."" Two-way polling is useful as a measure of what would happen if those voters dabbling with third-party candidates ultimately fall in line behind a major-party candidate by election day, as they typically do. But 46 states are going to feature four-way races on the ballot--Libertarians will make all 50 ballots, while Greens will make 46--and support for minor-party candidates has shown no signs of ebbing the way it usually does by now. That makes sense in a race with two historically disliked major-party candidates. What's unusual, though, is that the young, liberal voters more aligned with Clinton are falling for Johnson. That's strange, because aside from a few issues, he is a small-government, free-market ideologue. When Johnson ran for president in 2012, he proposed a 43 percent, across-the-board, single-year federal spending cut, the worst idea proposed by any candidate running for president that year. Even the most ardent balanced-budget fetishists propose doing so over the course of five or 10 years. Johnson's goal is to do it in one fiscal year, indiscriminately. The single-year spending cut he's proposing in this year's run is around 20 percent, in line with lower annual deficit projections. A 20 percent single-year cut in federal spending would still be an absolute disaster--and yes, he would bring the budget into balance entirely through spending cuts, as he's barred any tax increases. (Consider, too, what it would mean in the likely event of a recession to have a president who will refuse to enact anything but a balanced budget.) His tax reform plan, meanwhile, is much like Mike Huckabee's beloved Fair Tax: replace the income tax and payroll taxes with a consumption tax. This would sharply reduce revenue and make the tax code more regressive-- ""simplify"" it, as they like to say. Since we're talking about young voters here, too, don't ask Johnson for much help on college tuition. Same goes for your union drive. One response of liberals who look fondly on Johnson goes something like this: Well, there's no way Congress would allow him to implement his fiscal plans, so vote for him for his foreign policy, over which he has more latitude. Johnson would certainly be loath to launch new overseas wars--although, as Obama has shown, it's not easy to entirely resist the Pentagon, CIA, congressional hawks, and the entirety of D.C. foreign-policy groupthink once you're in office. But the idea that Congress wouldn't allow him to implement his fiscal plans seems only half true, and not for the policy priorities that young liberal voters would consider the good half. Republicans will hold the House in November, and their chances of retaining Senate control are improving by the day. (And in any case, if they were to lose the Senate in 2016, they'd probably pick it back up in 2018.) Which parts of Johnson's agenda get through a Republican Congress? Cuts to Medicare and Medicaid would would seem to be on the agenda. Johnson, who believes ""the government should not be involved in health care,"" would also cheerily sign on to a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, and his replacement would not be a single-payer health system. Already-cut discretionary spending programs would learn a new meaning of cut. Congressional Republicans (and plenty of Democrats), meanwhile, would look much less kindly upon Pentagon spending cuts, of either bases or plants in their own districts or bases abroad. Relying on Senate Democrats to block all of this with the filibuster both assumes that the legislative filibuster in its present state is long for this world and ignores how much deficit reduction can be achieved through the filibuster-proof budget reconciliation process. Johnson supports criminal justice reform, mainly by curtailing the war on drugs. Like a lot of politicians who had their heyday in the '90s, Johnson has undergone a transformation on this issue. I can believe that much of the conversion is genuine and the regret is real. But it's worth noting, for example, that during his 1998 campaign for governor of New Mexico, he ran tough-on-crime ads promising to make criminals serve ""every lousy second"" of their terms. This approach mingled with his free-market absolutism to bring about a governorship that was all too friendly to the private prison industry, a position he still defends. On net, from the perspective of the consensus, young, liberal voter, Johnson over Clinton means a marginally slimmer chance of a hypothetical ground war that Clinton--though more hawkish by instinct--has shown no interest in pursuing. More substantively, he would be more likely to curtail the use of drone strikes overseas. Clinton over Johnson, on net, means an entire fiscal, economic, and regulatory agenda that--while stymied in Congress in terms of large-scale expansions--would at least prevent things from getting actively, aggressively worse. Under Johnson, rich people would be richer, poor people would be poorer, and sick people would be sicker. Our only hope would be that the country could get too baked to notice.

21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/donald_trump_s_family_leave_plan_and_the_gop_s_ideological_civil_war.html	"Donald Trump has just unveiled a new set of proposals designed to help working parents meet their child care needs. Yes, you've read that right. Under the svengali-like influence of his daughter Ivanka--""Daddy, daddy, we have to do this,"" Trump claims she told him--the Republican presidential candidate has decided to take a brief respite from saying whatever outrageous things pop into his head to instead outline what he intends to do for stressed-out mothers and fathers. The centerpiece of Trump's child care plan is a federal guarantee of at least six weeks of paid maternity leave, which he'd finance by finding savings in the unemployment insurance program. But that's not all! Trump has included something in his plan for almost everyone: new deductions to help defray child care costs and the costs involved in looking after elderly relatives, spending rebates for low-income families eligible for the earned-income tax credit, and much more. Given that Donald Trump is making these promises, it would be advisable to take a wait-and-see approach, as he'll likely announce tomorrow that the media has twisted his words around and what he actually said is that he's going to build a big, beautiful wall. What I can say with more certainty is that, whether he's sincere or not, Trump's championing of these proposals is a significant moment in the history of the modern Republican Party. Over the course of his presidential campaign, Trump has repudiated many aspects of Republican economic orthodoxy. Unlike Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and the vast majority of conservative and libertarian economists, Trump opposes large-scale, less-skilled immigration and free trade. He has railed against Medicare and Social Security reforms designed to curb the growth of these programs, to the dismay of most conservative wonks, including many of those who are sympathetic to his restrictionist views on immigration. But Trump hasn't ever come out in favor of expanding the social safety net. If you're a small-government conservative who reluctantly backs Trump, the fact he has generally shied away from promising entirely new government programs is something you could just barely cling to. Until now. On the surface--and again, the surface is all we have right now--Trump's paid maternity leave proposal bears a close resemblance to a very good one advanced by domestic policy analyst Abby M. McCloskey in National Affairs last year. McCloskey, a conservative in good standing, has served as an adviser to the presidential campaigns of former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Donald Trump's mortal enemy, the famously low-energy former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Her proposed maternity-leave program is simple, cheap, pro-growth, and business-friendly. Right now, paid leave is a perk that enlightened employers use to retain talent. But it's fairly rare among the businesses that employ most of America's low-wage workers, despite the fact that it is low-wage workers who need paid leave the most. Instead of requiring all employers to pay new mothers their full salaries while they're on maternity leave--an approach that might have the perverse effect of discouraging employers from hiring women--McCloskey proposed a modest, taxpayer-funded maternity-leave benefit that would serve as a safety net for those currently without paid leave. Given the popularity of maternity-leave benefits, you'd think Republican candidates would jump at something like McCloskey's proposal. Nevertheless, it landed with a thud. Neither Perry nor Bush made paid maternity-leave benefits a part of their presidential campaigns, despite the fact that it was an easy way to communicate to voters, and in particular to working- and middle-class parents, that they were looking out for their best interests, not just those of well-heeled donors. Only Trump was willing to take her idea seriously. Were Republicans right to ignore paid leave? As McCloskey acknowledged in National Affairs, ""conservatives traditionally have opposed passing laws providing or mandating maternity benefits under the belief that, in a free market, the private sector and its employees would work out a mutually beneficial leave arrangement."" And as Robert Costa and Sean Sullivan delicately put it in a Washington Post write-up of Trump's child-care agenda, ""conservative Republicans, in particular, have long seen a mandated expansion of the social safety net as anathema to their attempts to shrink government spending and give companies more control over their leave policies."" So it should come as no surprise that conservatives have been quick to denounce Trump for embracing what looks like a big-government spending plan.

He wants to ""build the wall."" He wants Mexico to ""pay for it."" He wants to do something ""for the veterans."" He wants to ""take care of our people."" He wants to ""win so much your head will spin,"" and he wants to deport ""illegal immigrants."" What Trump doesn't have are policies. We don't know how he'll build a wall on our border with Mexico or how he'll force the Mexican government to pay for it. He doesn't have details for what he'll do to improve the Department of Veterans Affairs or how he'll implement his ideas for health care or trade reform. Go to his website, and you're met with vague assertions and broad rhetoric. There's little detail on what Trump plans to spend, how he plans to pay for it, and what he thinks his programs will look like. There is no Team Trump policy shop translating his feelings and ideas into actual plans. Or at least not anymore. It was disbanded. His rhetoric is even more remarkable. Trump evinces little knowledge of the details of public policy, stumbling over the basics of American governance and frequently demonstrating his ignorance of key challenges and issues in policymaking. On Monday morning, for instance, Trump accused President Obama of keeping interest rates down, oblivious to the fact that the White House isn't responsible for interest rates--the Federal Reserve is. Trump, simply put, doesn't know anything, and we don't know anything about him. He is a political cipher who exists outside traditional performance standards for presidential candidates, and as a result he has dictated the terms on which the political press judges him. Think of this as Trump's first public works project: He has built the curve on which he is being graded. This makes for a real contrast with Hillary Clinton, who is known for the depth and breadth of her policy knowledge. And regardless of where you stand on Clinton and her priorities, you know what they are. Go to the issues page of Clinton's campaign website, and you're bombarded with policies. Want to know Clinton's plan for criminal justice reform? Just click the widget. Want to see what she'll do about addiction and substance abuse? There's a four-point plan and a full fact sheet for her proposals. Curious what Clinton thinks about environmental conservation? There's a full plan, ready for your consumption. Overall, her website has policy statements available for 38 different issue areas. Clinton has given enough detail that we can begin to speculate about what she would do as president. For Trump, we have to guess at his agenda--or at least, anything beyond ""build the wall"" and ""make Mexico pay for it""--and at how he would behave as president. This dynamic goes beyond questions of policy. It is one of the defining features of this campaign. Clinton behaves like a normal politician, albeit one on the secretive side, and Trump is a radical outlier, revealing nothing about his health, his taxes, or his business dealings. On Sunday, the political press was consumed with the story of Clinton's apparent illness at a 9/11 memorial event in New York City. A video, captured by a bystander, shows Clinton collapsing as she entered a vehicle. The Clinton campaign refused to inform its press pool and stonewalled on the event until persistent criticism forced a response. Clinton has been battling allergies and is sick with pneumonia. She was dehydrated and exhausted, and she went wobbly as a result. The reaction to this, from the press, is that Clinton should have been more transparent. And they're right. Team Clinton should have revealed the candidate's illness. And after the incident in New York, the Clinton campaign should have immediately informed the press of the situation. Team Clinton seems to have learned its lessons; this week, the candidate will release more detailed medical records to the public. Even if they won't tell us much, it's a victory for campaign transparency. But lost in the controversy is this fact: Insofar that we can even speculate about Clinton's health, it's because she released a detailed doctor's note to the public, shortly after announcing her campaign. Other than a bizarre statement from his alleged doctor, we know little about Trump's health. Indeed, despite his ubiquity on television and cable news, we know little about Trump as a candidate. He refuses to release his tax returns (you can read every one of Clinton's going back to 1990); refuses to say what he'll do with his businesses and assets if elected president, despite unsavory associations and real conflicts of interest; and refuses to answer questions about his foundation. None of this makes Clinton a model citizen. From her private email server at the State Department to her speeches to banks and other institutions, Clinton has been opaque and unwilling to divulge details. She is secretive, even when the truth is far from scandalous, as with her illness this past weekend. Given this, we should press her for more transparency. We should demand more disclosure from her campaign and more time with reporters. But in making those demands, we should neither forget nor neglect the extent to which Trump is unprecedented in his contempt for transparency. Given the tenor of coverage in this election, it is fair to say that there is a double standard at work. Clinton is covered like a presidential nominee, while Trump is still treated like a sideshow, as if he'll never be president. We saw this last week, at NBC News' Commander-in-Chief Forum. Clinton was questioned like someone who might soon sit in the Oval Office, while Trump enjoyed the soft bigotry of low expectations. That may make sense--the polls are still in Clinton's favor. But the more Trump isn't scrutinized for his unusual disdain for disclosure, the more likely it is that we find ourselves in a world where Donald Trump is president, and we know nothing about him or how he intends to lead the country. This is how the sideshow wins. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Trump Isn't Transparent About Anything. Why Do We Only Hear About Clinton's Secrecy?

He was 76 and the bravest man I knew. The night before I met Timberg in 2011, I flipped through my father's 1964 copy of Lucky Bag, the United States Naval Academy's yearbook. I found Timberg's photograph, a handsome man with a strong jaw and intense eyes. We met the next day at an Annapolis restaurant, a few hundred yards from the academy's gates. The man in the photograph wasn't there. A Viet Cong grenade blew that midshipman's visage away when he was 26, 13 days before he was due home. His future was bright, as Timberg said later, until it wasn't. He endured dozens of surgeries including one without anesthesia that was so traumatic that he swears the doctor aged before his eyes during the operation. What were left almost a half-century later were layers of scar tissue, but he still had the fierce green eyes of his youth. Timberg didn't really know my father--Bob was set for the Marines; my dad wanted to be a pilot--but he had set aside a day to show me around the academy. I was in the middle of doing some heartbreaking research on my father, who was killed in an EA-6B crash off the USS Kitty Hawk when I was 13, hoping I could make sense out of it all in a book. Timberg had the easy-to-confide-in manner that all good reporters possess, and we were soon trading stories about our lives. He returned stateside after many surgeries and set upon finding something that mattered to him as much as being a Marine. His first wife told him he wrote beautiful letters from Vietnam, and on that flimsy detail he became a journalist. Through a quirk of the job market he found himself in the shadow of the academy at the Annapolis Capital and then working in the Washington bureau of the Baltimore Sun. Timberg often told himself that he didn't want his life defined by his Vietnam year or his disfigurement, but it was there every day. When kids would gawk and shriek at his face, he'd yell and scold their parents. He tried to put Vietnam away, but after he wrote a piece for Esquire about an academy boxing match between Oliver North and James Webb, he turned to The Nightingale's Song, an account of the academy's five most famous, or notorious, 1960s graduates--John McCain, North, Webb, Bud McFarlane, and John Poindexter--following their lives from Annapolis to Vietnam and then onto Washington. Two of them became senators and the other three were indicted, but all five had something in common with Timberg: They all engaged in clumsy, sometimes heroic, sometimes criminal attempts to rewrite American life after the fall of Saigon. Timberg spent more than a decade working on The Nightingale's Song, begging his bosses at the Sun for multiple extensions as he essentially wrote five book-quality profiles of his chosen men. He had ambivalent feelings about the actual mission in Vietnam but not about the dedication of the Nightingale Five. He attended journalism school at Stanford and his problem with the liberal students wasn't their opposition to the war, but their refusal to put anything on the line. He had more respect for the conscientious objectors than for those lounging on endless student deferments. He was fascinated by the quintet, disillusioned and scarred from Vietnam, who returned to service after hearing the ""nightingale song"" of Ronald Reagan's ""Morning in America."" If the book has a fault, it's Timberg going light on the excesses of Poindexter, McFarlane, and North, whom he didn't think was all that bright. But these were Timberg's brothers, in a sense; complete objectivity would have been impossible."	His Face Was Blown Off by a Viet Cong Grenade. Years Later, Writer Bob Timberg Held Up a Mirror...

""Well, the time has come,"" John Chancellor said to his desk mate, Tom Brokaw, on the NBC Election Central set that the network had erected at Rockefeller Center. It was 8:15 p.m. Eastern time on Nov. 4, 1980, and Chancellor was ready to deliver an ""NBC News projection"" that Ronald Reagan would be the next president of the United States. Chancellor showed his math on a large analog map behind him: Exit polls indicated enough states going for Reagan--in the fashion of the time, Republican states went blue--that he was ensured of 270 electoral votes even though polls had yet to close in Western time zones. By the time CBS's Walter Cronkite declared Reagan the victor, about two hours later, President Jimmy Carter had already delivered a concession speech. ""The three networks invested a record $7 million in covering last Tuesday's political super bowl,"" Newsweek crowed in its next issue. ""While the game's suspense may have suffered from an early whistle, the prestige reaped by getting a scoop on the score was, for NBC, well worth the price."" Everything about election-night journalism has gotten flashier over the generation since--except the scoops. The networks' early calls prompted a congressional inquiry into whether they had depressed West Coast turnout. The three broadcast networks rejected demands that they wait until everyone in the country had voted to report or forecast any results. (There was scant evidence that NBC's early call had exerted any influence on voter behavior or outcomes.) As a concession, however, the networks promised not to use their exit polls to project the race in a given state until polls had closed there. In the years that followed, other news organizations that had not been subject to the same political pressure--radio stations, newspapers, wire services, cable networks, and websites--nonetheless accepted it as a controlling precedent. Now a de-facto self-imposed gag order hangs over the daylight hours of the year's biggest news event, sequestering the civic exercise of Election Day from the media spectacle of election night. This distinction is enforced only by the pieties of good-government advocates who, in the wake of the 1980 episode, paternalistically argued that voters cannot be trusted with live information. Now newsrooms show long lines, interview people with ""I voted"" stickers, speculate about the impact of the weather--but refuse to tell the public who is winning and who is losing. Once the polls close, there is intense competition for their decision desks to call states, but up until that point news organizations enforce what amounts to a cartel of silence. To pick up Newsweek's metaphor, on the biggest news day of the year, news organizations offer an interminable pregame show and then flip to the final score, skipping the Super Bowl itself. Campaigns, however, do know who is winning the game as it is being played. They have never relied on exit polls, which were designed to illuminate who voted and why, for the benefit of postelection analysis, not to predict results in real time. Instead, candidates, parties, and super PACs use a combination of analytics and active tracking of turnout across preselected precincts to produce rolling projections of how many votes they have won as the ballots are cast. They have found this method to be uncannily accurate at matching the ultimate vote count. Voters have never had access to such analytics, but there is no reason that journalists can't apply the same methods as the campaigns--and there are very good reasons why doing so is in the public interest. A group of election veterans has therefore come together to form a new company called VoteCastr, in which I am a partner, and we are building our own version of that Election Day data apparatus. In partnership with Slate, VoteCastr will publicly debut its system on Nov. 8. From the moment that polls open on the East Coast, Slate readers will know as much about how many votes Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have accumulated across the battleground states as Hillary and Donald and their teams do. Our goal is not to beat the networks and wire services to declaring winners and losers--election night will still belong to their analysts and their magic walls--but to guarantee that citizens who have been entrusted with a vote also have access to as much information as possible about how their fellow citizens are voting. * * * Just after Labor Day in 2008, a team within Barack Obama's Chicago headquarters began laying the groundwork for what on Election Day would become the ""national boiler room."" The campaign planned to dispatch poll-watchers to more than 50,000 precincts across 17 battleground states. At three-hour increments throughout the voting day, the watchers would call a dedicated phone number and punch in the total number of voters who had cast ballots at the precinct they were observing. The campaign's data team had been running large-scale surveys throughout the year, so it already had a clear idea of just how much support it could expect in key areas. By combining its survey data with the real-time turnout reports from the field on Election Day, analysts could assess how Obama-friendly precincts were performing relative to McCain-friendly ones and make more than an educated guess about which states the campaign would carry. As political analytics have grown more sophisticated in the years since, the speed and quality of Election Day projections have only increased. In states with extensive early voting programs, it is now possible to know which citizens have returned ballots--local authorities typically release a list of voter names each day during an early voting period--and match those to statistical models predicting how each individual will vote. Even before the polls opened in Ohio on Election Day 2012, Obama's analytics staff predicted that the president was getting 56.4 percent of the early vote in Hamilton County, which contains Cincinnati. The guess was just two-tenths of a percent away from the actual tally released by county officials as soon as polls closed. When campaigns assemble such systems, they can turn to existing assets: reams of granular data about the electorate, statistical models to sift through that data, and an expansive field operation that can track activity levels at individual polling places. As a startup unaffiliated with any political organization, VoteCastr has had to develop those assets from scratch. Its bipartisan team includes experts who were responsible for the turnout-tracking operations used by the last two successful presidential candidates. Blaise Hazelwood was the political director for the Republican National Committee and managed Election Day reporting for George W. Bush's re-election in 2004. Ken Strasma was the chief of microtargeting for the Obama team in 2008 and engineered the data infrastructure for the boiler room. (Hazelwood's Grassroots Targeting worked for a super PAC supporting Bobby Jindal during the primaries, and Strasma's HaystaqDNA worked for Bernie Sanders' campaign, but neither is involved in the presidential race any longer.) Strasma and Hazelwood will be conducting large-sample surveys--many more respondents than typical media polls, each answering far fewer questions--that will allow them to assess support for presidential and statewide candidates at the level of individual precincts. At the same time, VoteCastr is training an army of hundreds of turnout trackers, each assigned to preselected polling places across battleground states. (The specific states will be determined closer to Election Day, depending on public interest and competitiveness, for both the presidency and Senate control.) The survey data will predict how exactly support in, say, Cleveland's precinct 14D should break down between Clinton and Trump, and between Sen. Rob Portman and his challenger, Ted Strickland. So when a tracker visits Denison Elementary School and reports via a smartphone app that 78 people have voted by 11:15 am, VoteCastr can determine how well each candidate is faring. By blending this information with reports from dozens of other precincts across the state, VoteCastr's statistical models can predict who is, at that very moment, winning Ohio and by what margin. Over the course of the day, each candidate's vote share will move, as turnout surges in some areas and wanes in others. All of this information will be presented to Slate readers in real time as the day unfolds and new data comes in. In those states where a large share of the electorate votes early--like Florida, North Carolina, Colorado, and Nevada--we will know which candidate is ahead before dawn has even broken and whether that lead appears insurmountable. The accuracy of these projections will be reliant on the underlying polling and susceptible to some of the same vulnerabilities as other efforts to measure public opinion through surveys. If voters are systematically underreporting their support for one candidate, or if there is an abnormally late swing toward a candidate, VoteCastr's models will probably fail to accurately forecast support levels. But by late October the debate we are likeliest to be having about the accuracy of polls is how much the poll sample looks like the group of people who will end up actually voting. The benefit of the VoteCastr method is that it is continually correcting its sample by feeding in new information about who has already voted, as opposed to relying on guesses based on people who say they will (or who pollsters have decided are most likely to do so). In the end, the results of this election will all come down to turnout, and ours is the only way to track turnout in real time. * * * In 2008, Obama's national boiler room circulated regular turnout reports to senior staff at headquarters, but there is only so much campaigns can do on Election Day itself. Their television buys and direct-mail programs are complete, and they can't realistically move staff or redirect the candidate's plane to another part of the country to boost turnout. Ultimately what is left to do is to tinker most efficiently at the margins: to redirect get-out-the-vote phone calls or digital contact (like text messages) toward underperforming areas or to prioritize the candidate's satellite or radio interviews into markets that need a boost. Some campaigns will physically redeploy surrogates and canvassers, but usually only within states, not across them. (A more ambitious form of turnout reporting, in which campaigns track which individual voters have cast ballots, has led to colossal technical failures--both when the Obama campaign code-named its program Houdini in 2008 and when Mitt Romney's staff called his ORCA four years later.) Campaign managers don't build such boiler rooms because they think what they can do on Election Day will necessarily tip the election, but because they want as much information as they can possibly get in order to avoid surprises when the polls close and prepare to explain the outcome. Why shouldn't voters have access to the same information used to profile and sort them, information that can help make sense of the way that candidates market to them through the election's final hours? At least since the 1970s, journalists have worked to generate reasonable simulacra of the tools campaigns themselves use internally to inform strategy and guide tactics. Media surveys, especially tracking polls, enable the press to monitor horse-race movement the way a political strategist would. Simulations like those popularized by Nate Silver help the public weigh a range of potential electoral college outcomes the way national campaigns do when deciding how to shift resources around the map. Televised focus groups allow viewers to feel the texture of voter sentiment. In this election cycle, several broadcast networks and national newspapers have wisely signed contracts with political data vendors providing access to the voter files that campaigners use to triage the electorate. These investments by media organizations serve to shrink the distance between public and private information. This is not purely to indulge the fetish with campaign mechanics that Joan Didion dismissed as ""insider baseball"" or to pursue transparency for its own sake. There is at stake a crucial democratic principle: Only by trying to replicate the lens through which politicians view the electorate can citizens begin to recognize how their leaders see them. The stories that candidates tell themselves about the result of an election often begin while the polls are still open and endure throughout their time in office: A candidate who is sworn in thinking he won by turning out a party base is likely to govern differently than one who credits a last-minute swing from late-deciding independents. By midafternoon on Nov. 7, 2000, Karl Rove had already internalized the notion that if George W. Bush were to win the presidency, he would have done so despite failing to mobilize large numbers of social conservatives. That analysis hung over the White House for all of Bush's first term, but the media did not fully process it as a guiding principle of his presidency for nearly a year--in part because they were unable to see each side's base vote come in at the same pace that Bush's team did. Journalists know that people who work in politics have access to proprietary information that can give form to our vague speculation about how a strong ground game or voting-machine problems or weather patterns are affecting turnout in different places. And yet no news organization has brought the ideal of letting voters know what the campaigns know to its coverage of Election Day itself. Instead, we spend all day calling (and now texting and direct-messaging) our sources inside the campaigns to ask what they are seeing and hearing--and usually end up with little more than self-serving summaries that have rattled down the consultant grapevine. This information occasionally informs coverage, although in ways so coded or cherry-picked that readers and viewers would probably be better served to receive none of it at all. With nearly one-third of Americans now voting early--potentially filling out a ballot at a dining room table with CNN on in the background and an open tablet displaying FiveThirtyEight--the Election Day distinction is also pathetically out of date. For those who do still vote on that day, the news void is predicated on a condescending fiction. Do we really believe that after months of being perpetually subjected to assessments of the horse race--polls, averages of polls, forecasts synthesizing the poll averages--the slate can be wiped clean and voters restored to a state of decision-making innocence in some kind of hushed democratic idyll? In many parts of the world, the blackout is enforced by federal law. A 2012 study by the University of Hong Kong Public Opinion Programme found 38 countries (out of 83 surveyed) with legal limits on the release or coverage of pre-election polls. (In Honduras, the ban stretched over 45 days prior to the vote.) In the United States, however, there has never been any threat to regulate news coverage more serious than the brief congressional inquest instigated by embittered West Coast legislators who lost their seats in 1980 and blamed the networks for discouraging their supporters from turning out. League of Women Voters President Ruth J. Hinerfeld told a Senate Rules Committee hearing that ""the race to project victories may increase network ratings, but it may also have serious and harmful effects on voter confidence in the integrity of the election system and in the value of an individual vote."" California Sen. S.I. Hayakawa, who proposed a full ban on reporting election results until all Americans had voted, said his constituents ""had been disenfranchised by a system that allowed an election to be called while the polls were still open."" But little beyond superstition supports the claim that exposing those who haven't yet voted to information about the state of the race will discourage them from exercising their franchise. Research in the wake of the 1980 election--and another similar episode, in 1964, when CBS declared Lyndon Johnson the winner at 6:03 p.m. Pacific time--yielded unconvincing evidence that the early calls had had an impact on Western turnout. (It was hard to disentangle the fact that Carter, likely informed by his own private data, did not wait until polls had closed to concede.) In fact, recent experiments have shown some of the most effective techniques to mobilize nonvoters involve increasing awareness of the rate at which their peers and neighbors are voting. It seems as reasonable to hypothesize that reports of turnout levels and public attention to the shared experience of the ballot box would be more likely to motivate citizens to participate than to discourage them. Slate has never put much stock in the idea that citizens must be protected from information about how an election is unfolding. The magazine was a leader in a movement by nonlegacy news organizations to undermine the cartel of Election Day silence. In both 2000 and 2004, Slate was among several websites that chose--at the expense of public scoldings and at least one cease-and-desist order--to violate an embargo on exit polls compiled by the Voter News Service and its successor, National Election Pool. As Slate's then-editor Jacob Weisberg argued to the New York Times in 2004, ""the big news organizations withhold this data on the totally unproven theory that exit polls reduce turnout."" (That year, turnout hit its highest level in nearly four decades, but the exit polls proved useless as a forecasting device: They showed John Kerry ahead of Bush in key states he would eventually lose.) Today, the obligation on an independent press is no longer to challenge the information monopoly of television networks and wire services, which now share exit poll data under newly effective quarantine, but to produce for the public good the same type of private information that political insiders have long taken for granted and will use until the last available moment to try to win your vote. The time has come to level the playing field and to trust that the democratic process is always better when citizens are informed, not cosseted, by the free press--especially on the day it matters most.

25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/the_media_s_coverage_of_nbc_s_trump_clinton_forum_was_a_disaster.html	"On Wednesday night, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump sat for back-to-back interviews with NBC's Matt Lauer at the same place, which allowed the network to bill it as a sort of proto-debate and for news organizations to cover it as such. Much of the criticism of the event has focused on how Lauer was rougher with Clinton than he was with Trump. Well, fine. But if you looked at each segment from a higher vantage point, you would've seen what you've been seeing every day of this campaign: One candidate, loathsome though you may find her, is qualified to be president; the other, entertaining as he may be, is not. One candidate is aware of and has informed opinions on issues of public policy. The other does not. One way to handle the asymmetry would be to point it out at every turn. Another way would be to not point it out at all, and in fact to grade the two candidates on different metrics altogether. Like, say, ""style"" versus ""substance."" But who would be that shallow? Bloomberg's Mark Halperin described the affair as a ""really discouraging moment for the country"" on the Thursday morning edition of chat show Morning Joe. ""Neither of them rose to the occasion of what we need in the next president, I don't think. I hope they do going forward, but they didn't last night."" OK. What did Trump do wrong? ""Substance matters, issues matter, intelligence, knowledge, these matter most of all,"" Halperin said, ""and his performance on those points should be a real caution for his people."" OK, so Trump didn't demonstrate any substance, intelligence, or knowledge. That's suboptimal. But what did Clinton do that was equally discouraging and shameful for the republic? ""I thought her stylistic performance--if I were involved in her debate preparation, I'd be terrified if she replicates that in the debates."" Trump had absolutely no idea what he was talking about, because he doesn't know anything. Clinton, meanwhile, did not ... she wasn't ... she seemed kinda ... why can't she just chill out, sometimes, sorta thing, right? Both Trump and Clinton are equal affronts to America, Western Civilization, and God. This equally weighted, ""he doesn't know anything whatsoever, but she isn't fun,"" substance-versus-style breakdown wasn't strictly the domain of Halperin. ""Donald Trump Uninformed,"" his network declared elsewhere, ""Hillary Clinton Imperiled."" And neither Clinton nor Trump ""appeared ready for the brightest lights of 2016 as they flashed the very liabilities that make their backers uneasy,"" Politico wrote. ""Clinton wobbled on style. Trump stumbled on substance."" The ensuing on-the-one-hand-on-the-other here needs a little space to breathe."	On the One Hand, the Media's Coverage of the Trump-Clinton Forum Was a Disaster
26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/nbc_s_commander_in_chief_forum_was_an_authoritarian_farce.html	"Wednesday night's ""Commander-in-Chief Forum,"" presented by NBC News and MSNBC, was a debacle. Every network that's hosting a presidential debate in the next seven weeks should study the video to learn how not to interrogate Donald Trump. But Trump still managed, through boastful indifference, to reveal the most important thing about his presidency: He would make the United States an authoritarian country. Trump played his usual tricks. When he was quizzed about foreign policy, he changed the subject to trade. When he was pressed for solutions, he talked instead about President Obama's failures. When he was asked about a tweet in which he had blamed military sexual assaults on the integration of women, he acted as though he had always believed the problem was insufficient prosecution. He also claimed, contrary to fact--and undisputed by moderator Matt Lauer--that he had been ""totally against the war in Iraq."" Trump said at least two newsworthy things. First, he bragged that Mexico's finance minister had just been ousted for setting up Trump's meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. ""The people that arranged the trip to Mexico have been forced out of government,"" Trump said. ""That's how well we did. And that's how well we're going to have to do."" This boast tells you two things about Trump. It tells you that he measures success by the discord he sows in countries he visits. And it tells you that he likes to humiliate these countries. Second, Trump claimed that in the classified intelligence briefing he received on Aug. 17, he learned ""that our leadership, Barack Obama, did not follow what our experts"" had recommended ""in almost every instance."" That's quite a claim, since the briefing was prepared by James Clapper, Obama's director of national intelligence. The session was classified, so Clapper and his briefers can't rebut Trump in public. This tells you how Trump would treat classified information as president: He would lie about it for political gain and dare the intelligence community to violate the law by exposing him. But the most important moments in this forum weren't the ones in which Trump made news. They were moments in which he proudly underscored his authoritarian ambitions. First came his answer to a question about ISIS. ""I've always said [we] shouldn't be there,"" Trump said. ""But if we're going to get out, take the oil."" When Lauer asked him how we would take Iraq's oil, Trump replied: ""You would leave a certain group behind, and you would take various sections where they have the oil."" We got ""nothing"" for the money we spent invading Iraq, Trump complained. ""It used to be, 'To the victor belong the spoils.' ... I always said, 'Take the oil.' "" This is a policy of explicit theft. Trump has stated this policy many times. He has been applauded for it by crowds and has not been morally challenged by Lauer or other interviewers. Now Trump is repeating it in the run-up to the fall debates. He's betting that Americans will embrace--and the media will accept--plunder as foreign policy. So far, he has not been proved wrong. Second, Trump continued to pretend that he has a secret plan to destroy ISIS--but that he can't divulge it because he has to be ""unpredictable."" ""I have a plan,"" he told Lauer, but ""I don't want to broadcast to the enemy what my plan is."" This was a forum expressly designed to help Americans understand, before voting, how the candidates would address national security and foreign policy. Instead, Trump refused to say what he would do, on the grounds that the revelation would help ISIS. Third, Trump expanded on his admiration of Russian President Vladimir Putin. When Lauer noted that Trump had called Putin a ""highly respected"" leader, Trump pointed to Russian polls: ""Well, he does have an 82 percent approval rating."" The exchange continued:"	NBC's Commander in Chief Forum Was an Authoritarian Farce
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/how_the_iraq_war_set_the_stage_for_the_hurricane_katrina_disaster.html	"The research for this project was sponsored by a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting. Something about walking naked through the ruins of St. Bernard Parish at 2 in the morning helped Tech Sgt. Mickey Giovingo leave Iraq. Since returning from war, he had slept in his car in the driveway of his smashed, cream-colored ranch house, in his uniform--the only clothing he had. He remembers sitting out there at night, thinking, ""There are more noises at night in the desert than here."" He was hypervigilant, startling at the smallest sounds. Sometimes, he went out on patrol. He'd hear a car pull up and head over to confront the driver; copper thieves were ransacking abandoned houses, tearing out their plumbing. He says he never threatened them but told the invaders to leave or he'd call the police. He always took along the gun he'd bought as soon as he arrived home, tucked behind his back. ""A combat-mode kind of thing,"" he said. One night, the isolation felt unbearable, and he had an idea. He took off his clothes, put on his tennis shoes, and went out into the devastation. He'd been subject to military discipline for months. He'd lost everything. Walking up the street stripped bare, he at last felt under his own command. When else could he do this without getting thrown in jail? ""It was freeing,"" he said. Giovingo deployed to Iraq on Aug. 29, 2005, the same day Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana. Raised in midcity, he had a gift for electronics and had entered the Air Guard's engineering and installation unit, wiring military facilities in Louisiana and then in the Middle East. He had been in Al-Udeid, Qatar, the night the storm neared shore. He flew to a base in Kirkuk the next morning. Over the next awful days, he and other guardsmen from the Gulf Coast kept close to the projection TVs in the dining hall. They saw the storm strike and the levees crumble and listened to reports of looting and chaos. ""I knew my house was gone,"" he recalled. Giovingo had served as the Guard's liaison to St. Bernard and knew its telecom system well; communication lines out of the parish had gone silent. It took him nearly a month, jockeying with others for internet time, to confirm that his family was safe. Meanwhile, he continued the dangerous work of laying cable along a trench in the base's airstrip with his team. ""You're worried about rockets and mortars coming in ... "" he said, ""and then at night, you're like, 'What am I going to do when I get back?' "" Giovingo faced a hard choice. The soldiers of the 256th, an infantry brigade of the Louisiana National Guard, had been scheduled to rotate out at the end of September, and the guard decided to speed them home, to reunite them with their families and allow them to be on hand for recovery work. Giovingo was part of a separate unit, but the guard found seats for him and four members of his team on the return flight. He asked his colleagues if they should take the offer; his colleagues deferred to him. He decided to stay. He was committed to finishing what he'd started, and he'd need combat pay--$225 extra per month--to help him rebuild in New Orleans. His sister told him about a Federal Emergency Management Agency aid program, and he got through to the agency despite his tight phone time allotment. You're deployed? Not eligible. ""How far do I have to deploy, I mean evacuate, to get money?"" he asked himself. ""I felt like I was in no-man's land and forgotten."" * * * Wars and storms have a way of getting ensnared. Nobody knew this better than the National Guard. It had long held a portfolio of tasks crammed with unlike things: storms, protests, fires, uprisings, wars. At the start of the Iraq war, the Defense Department had mobilized guard forces on a scale not seen since World War II. ""The day of [the] National Guard standing back and concerning itself with riots and natural disasters is a thing of the past,"" said Brig. Gen. Glenn K. Rieth, adjutant general of the New Jersey Guard, a month prior to the invasion. As of September 2005, about 175,000 National Guardsmen had been called to active duty, about 40 percent of the guard's total forces; they made up about 15 percent of the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Their mission took its toll at home. Guardsmen anticipated six-month stints--maybe a year--but sometimes found their missions drawn out further, in a few cases as long as 20 months. Spc. John Blanchett of the Illinois Guard told a reporter his platoon had been about to return home after a 447-day deployment when the Pentagon decided abruptly, at midnight on Easter Sunday, to keep them in-country. Most of their belongings had already been shipped home. ""Don't get me wrong,"" Blanchett said, ""we're all doing our job for the country. We're just tired as hell."" Administration officials offered assurances that the wars were not impairing Americans' safety. To the contrary, they were the only way to protect the country. ""We're taking the fight to the terrorists abroad so we don't have to face them here at home,"" declared President Bush. The idea of overseas war as the guarantor of security at home sidestepped the question of trade-offs between a nation's wars and its welfare, but it was logical-sounding, and comforting, to many at the time. Even so, a year into the Iraq war, guard leaders and governors across the political spectrum were warning that state guard units had been dangerously thinned out by overseas deployment. Officials feared being ""caught short-handed if an emergency flares up,"" according to the Associated Press. The bland bureaucratese of an April 2004 report by the General Accounting Office did not hide harsh conclusions: Overseas missions were draining the guard of its troops, particularly in expert specialties. Fifteen states had 40 percent or more of their Army National Guard soldiers mobilized or deployed, and some as many as one-third of their Air National Guard units. With 59 percent of its guard alerted, mobilized, or deployed, hurricane-prone Louisiana had the third-highest rate in the country. Personnel transfers could build up numbers, but only 68 percent of the guard's required service members were qualified in the specialties to which they were assigned. Absent equipment also posed intractable problems. The guard had already transferred materiel from domestic units to underequipped units being sent to Iraq. Mississippi's 223rd Engineer Battalion, for example, tasked with repairing hurricane damage, returned home from Iraq, but its equipment stayed abroad, inherited by newly arriving troops. Only five of its 26 helicopters remained in the state for rescue, relief, and security operations. The guard's answer was to share resources. Through interstate arrangements called emergency management assistance compacts, state governments asked one another for aid. But lengthy deployments strained the system in ways that officials did not always acknowledge. Brig. Gen. Frank Grass, deputy director of the Army National Guard, assured journalist Tom Ricks that if Montana were short on helicopters during a crisis, it could borrow from Wyoming or other states ""with just a phone call or two."" Ricks checked with Wyoming's guard and learned that four of its eight Black Hawks were overseas. * * * If wars and storms often collide, they also share something in common: They are unpredictable once loosed in the world. President George H.W. Bush had learned this the hard way. A year and a half after his popularity had soared with Saddam Hussein's defeat in the Persian Gulf war, Hurricane Andrew struck Florida. In the heat of a presidential race, Bush's delayed response led to charges ""that he's more skilled at addressing foreign crises than domestic ones,"" as George Stephanopoulos, Bill Clinton's communications director, put it. Barney Bishop, the Florida Democratic Party's executive director, was blunter. ""We can do something for the Shiites, we can do something for Somalia, but doggone it, you try to do something in the 50 states,"" he said. Some had suggested transferring emergency management from a failing FEMA to the military, but according to the agency's director, it would ""pose problems for the armed forces if a natural disaster struck at home while troops and equipment were engaged in a conflict like the Persian Gulf War."" The push and pull between natural hazards and national security goes back to the federal government's first concentrated efforts to prepare for nature's emergencies. Created by a March 1979 executive order, FEMA adopted what its first director, John Macy, called the ""all-hazards approach,"" preparing for fires, floods, tornadoes, and nuclear meltdowns, which required a common toolbox of rescue, relief, and recovery skills. Things changed rapidly with the election of Ronald Reagan, whose aspirations for FEMA mirrored his militarized foreign policy. To run the agency, he selected Louis O. Giuffrida, his security adviser in California and head of a counterterrorism training center. As FEMA's director, Giuffrida securitized the agency, stressing the threat of a Soviet nuclear attack and shrouding FEMA's costly doomsday programs in secrecy. Within four years, the agency's budget for security-related programs was 12 times that for natural disasters. Giuffrida's reign came to an abrupt end when it turned out he was planning to withstand Soviet nukes from the luxury kitchen of a private home built at taxpayer expense. His departure alone did not right the ship, and FEMA's reputation plummeted in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It had proved effective in sheltering political cronies from the hazards of unemployment but spectacularly ineffective when it came to conventional disasters. A 1993 study by the National Academy of Public Administration called on the agency to demilitarize, step into the light of public scrutiny, and embrace an all-hazards approach. The conditions for demilitarization were ripe in the early 1990s: the end of the Soviet Union, the rise of emergency management as a profession, and a chief executive aware that disasters could make or break presidencies. President Bill Clinton's appointment of his Arkansas emergency manager, the politically adept technocrat James Lee Witt, as FEMA director signaled a major shift. Witt professionalized FEMA's staff, transferred its civil defense budget to all-hazards work, and developed innovative mitigation programs to blunt the impact of foreseeable disasters before they struck. It helped that Clinton elevated FEMA's director to a Cabinet-level post and that Witt enjoyed unusual access to the Oval Office. By the late 1990s, the agency was hailed by Congress and local emergency managers. But Witt's energized FEMA soon faced political hazards it could not mitigate. Taking office in early 2001, George W. Bush asked Witt to continue at FEMA, but he declined, and Bush appointed his former chief of staff and campaign manager Joseph Allbaugh. With his lack of disaster expertise, abrasive style, enthusiasm for private contracting, propensity for political back-scratching, and preoccupation with cutting government programs, Allbaugh set out to shrink or eliminate FEMA's mitigation programs. The earth itself seemed displeased. The day after the administration proposed that Witt's successful Project Impact be cut, a 6.8-magnitude earthquake shook Washington state, where its grants had retrofitted schools, bridges, and houses to withstand shocks. Then came 9/11. What counted as risk constricted with great force: All-hazards was crushed in the vortex of terror. The administration had little use for threats that were not enemies. As first documented by Robert Block and Christopher Cooper in Disaster: Hurricane Katrina and the Failure of Homeland Security, the newly securitized environment corroded federal and state capacities for natural disaster preparation, mitigation, and response. FEMA lost Cabinet-level status and a direct line to the president and was folded into a gigantic new Department of Homeland Security, one of 22 agencies in a sprawling administrative edifice. While critics of the reorganization, including members of the House Judiciary and Transportation and Infrastructure committees, warned that it might bring, according to the Washington Post, ""serious unintended and probably unwelcome consequences,"" it moved forward. Even FEMA's name was eliminated--its functions were to be reassigned to a new ""Emergency Preparedness and Response Directorate""--until its new director, Michael Brown, convinced his superiors that the agency's well-respected ""brand"" would benefit the fledgling behemoth busy digesting it. ""There are three priorities at the moment,"" lamented Daryl Lee Spiewak, president of the International Association of Emergency Managers in March 2004: ""Terrorism, terrorism, terrorism."" One indicator was DHS's transfer of preparedness grants previously managed by FEMA to the Office of Defense Preparedness, a law-enforcement agency in the Justice Department. Facing the loss of critical funds, Spiewak's home department learned to milk the new menace. Needing a grant for flood training, he and his colleagues staged an exercise involving a terrorist attack on a dam. * * * The ascendancy of anti-terrorism can be told simply enough by following the money. Between 9/11 and August 2004, federal grants for anti-terrorism multiplied by a factor of more than 13, surging from $221 million to $3 billion, while FEMA's main grants for state and local emergency management shrank from $270 million to $180 million; funds for disaster mitigation were chopped in half. By mid-2005, $77.9 million had been shifted from FEMA's budget to other DHS programs; officials discovered entire functions and budget lines had vanished without warning. Officials at the National Emergency Management Agency, the managers' professional association, noted with alarm that the budgets for state emergency agencies were declining, requiring cuts that hit poor states, many of them disaster-prone, the hardest. The shift played out in painful ways across America's varied landscape of natural hazard. When flooding in Northeast Iowa in May 2004 devastated more than 200 homes and businesses, there was not enough money for postdisaster mitigation, even as large checks were being cut to fight shadowy enemies in unlikely places. Don Greene, an emergency manager in Alabama, received $250,000 for chemical warfare suits but was denied funds for an emergency operations center that would streamline communications during tornados. ""I really don't think Osama Bin Laden wants to attack Shelby County,"" he said. The sidelining of natural hazards was easiest to see where they were ostensibly the focus. Take, for example, the report by 35 experts from intelligence, industry, the military, and academia who convened on Sept. 16, 2003, to study, as they put it, ""How Terrorists Might Exploit a Hurricane."" They concluded that although hurricanes represented imperfect terrorist instruments, lone actors or small splinter groups could use them to scrutinize security responses, target evacuation routes and shelters, wage cyberattacks, or as ""a diversion or a way to capitalize on the concentration of Federal resources of the country while an attack is staged."" In the aftermath, they might foment ""public panic"" by disseminating alarming rumors. If Washington were struck, religious extremists might use it ""as a signal to attack"" or claim that it was ""a sign of God condemning the United States."" * * * Emergency managers pushed back. Speaking before a House committee in April 2005, David Liebersbach, NEMA's president, warned that ""changing the focus of preparedness to weigh so heavily on terrorism could severely hamper the ability of state and local government capabilities to respond to a wide range of events with a higher likelihood of occurrence, such as natural disasters."" On July 27, 2005, he wrote Sens. Susan Collins and Joseph Lieberman, heads of the Senate subcommittee overseeing Homeland Security, that FEMA's ""long-standing mission of preparedness for all types of disasters"" had been ""forgotten."" Three weeks later--two weeks before Katrina--he and a NEMA delegation told DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff and his top deputies in Washington that ""they were weakening emergency management with potentially disastrous consequences."" One improbable guardian of the all-hazards principle was Michael Brown. Brown's appointment as FEMA's director was pure gravy-train: He was a college friend of Joseph Allbaugh, and his previous job as commissioner of the International Arabian Horse Association was easy shorthand for incompetence and nepotism. Brown was inexperienced at managing disasters; inflexible when confronted with political realities he didn't like; and inclined to happy-talk, overpromise, and exercise an undue faith in the power of positive thinking, especially in front of cameras. But he was also an avid student and defender of the all-hazards principle that DHS was undermining, with a strong sense that FEMA's mandate should remain broad. Brown told higher-ups, albeit in muted tones, of his worries about the toll FEMA's securitizing host was taking on the agency's budget, staff, and mission. Just two months before Katrina, in June 2005, he wrote to Michael P. Jackson, DHS's deputy director, arguing that law enforcement, while important, was ""separate from the planning, training and exercises preparing for the disaster that occurs when Mother Nature sends four hurricanes across Florida in a six week period."" The loss of FEMA's preparedness functions would ""destroy the emergency management cycle and lead to failure,"" he wrote. But Brown kept his frustrations from public view. Invited to give the keynote at the 2005 National Hurricane Conference, he delivered sunny prepared remarks on how the merger with DHS had left FEMA ""stronger,"" then introduced James Lee Witt, who, he told his audience, could ""say things that I can't."" Witt did not disappoint. ""I am extremely concerned that the ability of our nation to prepare [and] respond to disasters has been sharply eroded,"" he told attendees, who rose to their feet, applauding. In one small, important instance, the emergency planners won, almost. Their victory was Hurricane Pam, a planning exercise involving 250 officials from more than 50 local, state, and federal agencies over eight days in July 2004. The simulated, hypothetical Category 3 hurricane provided 120 mph winds and a massive storm surge, pressed 20 feet of water over New Orleans' levees, inundated the city, and damaged 80 percent of its buildings. In its wake, disaster experts coordinated plans for search and rescue, short-term shelter, floodwater removal, debris disposal, temporary medical care, and school rebuilding. Asked how many could die in such a storm, FEMA spokesman David Passey was grim. ""We would see casualties not seen in the United States in the last century,"" he said. Everyone knew that follow-up sessions were needed to finalize a plan, but FEMA and DHS had other priorities. Budget shortfalls led to delays, and by the start of the 2005 hurricane season, participants knew that they were ""less than 10 percent done with transportation planning when you consider the buses and the people."" The planners also had difficulty getting key federal officials to take their bracing conclusions seriously. Ivor van Heerden, the Louisiana State University researcher who ran the Pam exercise, recalled how ""those Corps of Engineers people giggled in the back of the room when we tried to present information."" When, for example, he proposed tent cities to house those left homeless, ""[t]heir response to me was: 'Americans don't live in tents' ... "" In April 2005, while planners were struggling, and failing, to find funds to complete their hurricane planning, DHS carried out TOPOFF3, the largest terrorism drill ever staged in the United States, at the cost of $16 million. In it, something called the Universal Adversary unleashed two imaginary terrorist strikes. New Jersey hospitals were flooded with thousands of mock patients complaining of flulike symptoms caused by a biological agent. New London, Connecticut, hosted a car bombing and mock chemical attack in which 500 screaming actor-victims sprawled on the ground. To test their media skills, officials simulated a news conference with ""Video News Network."" Actual news agencies were held at arm's length. ""It was hard to gauge how the government officials comported themselves,"" wrote Marc Santora in the New York Times, ""since Homeland Security did not allow real reporters to watch the fake reporters and their broadcasts."" The managers' defeat was most visible in the National Response Plan, launched by DHS in January 2005. Its press release boasted that it represented ""a bold step forward in bringing unity in our response to disasters and terrorist threats and attacks."" However, in developing it, DHS Secretary Tom Ridge had turned not to FEMA, which had already begun to develop ideas, but to the Rand Corporation, better known for military consultation. Governors, emergency managers, and first responders who reviewed a draft of the plan in May 2003 rejected it as needlessly complex, bureaucratic, and muddled. It didn't address evacuation plans, the provisioning of electric power, or assistance for people with special needs, for example. Fifteen months later, Ridge issued a 426-page second draft that, while advertised as all-hazards, skewed toward post-9/11 preoccupations. A fact sheet stated that it established ""protocols to help protect the nation from terrorist attacks and other natural and manmade hazards,"" subordinating common natural disasters to unlikely unnatural ones. A quick search of the plan brings up the word terror and its cognates in 377 places, hurricane in five. By summer 2005, waves of cronyism, privatization, and securitzation had demoralized FEMA's once-proud staffers, who resigned in droves. Departures and retirements sapped the agency's expertise, while budget cuts prevented new hires. Among the myriad places that saw rescue and mitigation funding siphoned off by anti-terrorism was the city of New Orleans. On the eve of the 2005 hurricane season, Col. Terry J. Ebbert, its homeland security manager, told a House committee that a request to fund urban search-and-rescue water training for its police, fire, and emergency medical personnel had been refused ""because the curriculum ... did not include a WMD component."" The city had also been denied funds to purchase inexpensive aluminum boats that would enable fire and police departments to rescue people trapped by floodwaters. * * * It had been a raw year for the Louisiana National Guard's 256th Infantry Brigade Combat Team. Based in Western Baghdad, its soldiers had guarded convoys and bases, secured elections, and shielded the Abu Ghraib prison. By October 2005, two months after Hurricane Katrina, it had lost 22 of its 4,000 soldiers over the previous year; only New York's guards suffered more deaths. Then came the storm. Some 6,000 guardsmen from Louisiana and Mississippi looked on from Iraq as Katrina twisted through the Gulf, 7,000 miles and nine time zones away. ""With each minute that passed, we gathered around the televisions ... and we watched Katrina do her work,"" recalled Brian McDow, a guardsman with Louisiana's 141st Field Artillery Regiment. The stabilizing map of risk--threats are here, safety is over there--was upended. ""I had always worried about me not coming home,"" said Lt. William Besselman, ""never that my family could be in danger."" As it happened, the 256th was only weeks away from the end of its yearlong deployment, and guard officials and soldiers advocated to rush them home. Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco appealed directly to President Bush for their ""expeditious return."" Emergency flights were arranged. Military logistics, however, did not favor the Mississippi National Guard's 155th Armored Brigade Combat Team, whose soldiers were not scheduled to return until January. Of the 600 soldiers from the hardest-hit areas, only 80 were granted 15-day emergency leaves. One guardsman told his family that, when it came to replacements, they'd been informed that all other forward operating bases were ""tapped out and cannot send troops."" In Katrina's aftermath, many commentators asked pointedly, ""Where was the guard?"" Critics held that guard forces had been overmatched in the Gulf and rescued by federal soldiers. But in important ways, these charges were misguided. The guard had been everywhere, doing its best with war-stretched personnel and resources. Blanco had declared a state of emergency and activated the state's guard as early as Aug. 26. More than 50,000 guardsmen from all 50 states, three territories, and the District of Columbia participated in post-Katrina rescue, relief, and security efforts, comprising the majority of the more than 66,000 troops participating the largest postdisaster military deployment on U.S. soil. Guard forces evacuated thousands of residents by boat and helicopter; delivered emergency medical care; and distributed water, food, and ice. They pumped out floodwater, cleared roads, and hauled debris; they fixed water treatment plants and hooked together severed phone lines. They also staffed checkpoints, policed the Superdome, and enforced the city's mandatory evacuation. The guardsmen were driven, exhausted, and anguished. They were also proud. ""In Iraq and Kuwait, we were helping America,"" said Maj. Mike Kitchens. ""But it changes the dynamics when you are here and trying to help Americans."" From another angle, the guard had been missing. According to National Guard data, 5,804 Louisiana guardsmen had been activated in the disaster zone as of 10 a.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 30, the day after landfall. Other states' forces were arriving, but the total number of guardsmen in Louisiana did not reach 10,000, the state guard's number of troops, until sometime between Thursday morning and Friday morning--that is, between the third and fourth days of the crisis. By then, 45,000 people were trapped in the Superdome and convention center. When the troops did arrive, some brought the war with them. The administration's expansive campaign against terrorism had ingested FEMA and carried away critical segments of the guard, but it also infused rescue and relief operations with war sensibilities. To be sure, the United States' long-standing reliance on guardsmen to respond to natural disasters already blurred these lines. But approaching the post-Katrina catastrophe as a sudden, new war front within also came reflexively to the Bush White House. Even before the storm landed, administration officials were seeking ways to deploy federally controlled forces in the Gulf without running afoul of the Posse Comitatus Act, which barred these troops from engaging in domestic law enforcement. Toward this end, the vice president's counsel, David Addington, began invoking the specter of ""insurgents,"" whose existence would permit the president to send in military force under the Insurrection Act; the act allowed federal military forces to be deployed domestically in the case of ""unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellions against the authority of the United States."" Given ""the potential massive size of the problem,"" Addington speculated to the Defense Department counsel, ""there could be civil unrest during the aftermath""; it might be a good idea to have Insurrection Act orders ""in the can."" Ultimately, officials decided against the rapid deployment of federal troops; they were worried, according to the New York Times, about the ""political fallout if federal officials were forced to shoot looters."" Even if the insurgency Addington had anticipated never materialized, a tendency to approach post-Katrina operations as an extension of the United States' wars abroad could be witnessed among military personnel and in military media. ""Troops Begin Combat Operations in New Orleans,"" ran a headline in the Sept. 3 Army Times. The piece described preparations for urban warfare, with dozens of military trucks and up-armored Humvees leaving a staging area, while hundreds of troops flew in by Black Hawk and Chinook helicopters. ""We're going to go out and take the city back,"" Brig. Gen. Gary Jones, commander of the Louisiana National Guard's Joint Task Force, told a reporter. Staff Sgt. Roland Spano of the 769th Engineer Battalion, on the lookout for gunmen in New Orleans, told a newspaper that he saw similarities between his current mission and a recent deployment to Afghanistan. ""They're just animals over there, and they are animals here,"" he said. ""They're just bolder animals here."" Tasked with both control and rescue, troops could approach flood victims as adversaries, mistaking unauthorized self-rescue for enemy behavior. Daring fleets of rescuers, paddling between rooftops, were sometimes rounded up as flood-borne looters. Under orders, troops went house to house, forcing holdouts to evacuate, even where their homes were dry. ""It is surreal,"" said Fred Bible of the Oklahoma National Guard. ""You just never expect to do this in your own country."" They set up a system of checkpoints and curfews that prevented residents from re-entering the city or walking around at night. And there was the moment, around noon on Sept. 2, that a contingent of more than a thousand heavily armed National Guard troops advanced on the Morial Convention Center, weapons drawn. Thousands of people had fled there, but officials didn't know their numbers or intentions; rumors swirled of beatings, shootings, robberies, rapes, and murders inside. Once the forces were gathered, Lt. Gen. Steven Blum, chief of the National Guard Bureau, told reporters, they ""stormed the convention center, for lack of a better term."" The only thing missing were insurgents. Instead, the troops found nearly 20,000 flood victims who had desperately needed water, food, and medicine for three days. What had taken the troops so long? ""We waited until we had enough force in place to do an overwhelming force,"" Blum said. Otherwise ""innocents may have been caught in a fight between the Guard military policy and those who did not want to be processed or apprehended."" The center was taken within a half-hour; no shots were fired. Col. Jacques Thibodeaux, who commanded the operation, recalled driving down Convention Center Boulevard and smelling barbecued chicken. ""I realized right away that we're not going to have any problems here,"" he said. Blum congratulated the guard for its capture of the facility, which had been ""superbly executed with great military precision."" It would be difficult to make the same claim of the strange arrest of James A. Terry Jr. by men claiming to be from the Iowa National Guard. Terry, a 32-year-old black man, had been an honor roll, chess club, science club kid and served four years in the Army infantry. When Katrina hit, he was staying at the St. Vincent's Guest House on Magazine Street.  ""I had already survived the storm,"" he recalled. ""I thought the hard part was already past."" Then, while standing on his second-floor balcony checking for roof damage, he was spotted by uniformed men on patrol. They climbed over the 10-foot metal fence. Terry was inside his room when he heard glass breaking and the lock open. ""They were on a mission,"" he said. Here and elsewhere, military and police power blurred together. The men called in the New Orleans Police Department, who arrested him. Terry was never told why. Police officers took him to ""Camp Greyhound,"" a city bus station turned into makeshift prison, where he slept for two days on oil-soaked concrete with his shoes for a pillow. Terry was then transferred to Hunt Correctional Center, where he was held in a maximum-security cellblock with an insect infestation and one toilet for 65 men. Denied a formal charge or access to a lawyer, he was sure he'd be released, but the holidays came and went. He had been barred from obtaining legal materials, but he managed to get his hands on sample motions by trading items from the prison store, and he wrote to every official whose address he could find. He looked into hunger strikes. Then he got the address for the local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union from another prisoner. An attorney, Katie Schwartzmann, contacted the prison to say she was on her way. Terry was suddenly released, without explanation. He had been imprisoned for nearly seven months. He had never been charged, appointed an attorney, or afforded a court hearing. ""New Orleans was like a police state,"" said Schwartzmann. Terry had been ""arrested in his own house for looting."" In January 2007, he sued the mayor, police officers, and prison officials for monetary damages, but not the guard. No one could determine who the men in military uniform had been. They had left no written record; the police had apparently seen their military outfits and taken Terry into custody, no questions asked. The Iowa Guard denied involvement, claiming the men had been from a militia; Terry, who had been in the military, insisted they were the real thing. In a June 2010 decision, a judge for the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Terry's detention, claiming that he had not been denied legal access and that the ""delay"" in his release had not violated his due process rights. Invoking the storm, the judge spoke of ""context[s] in which the normal operating rules must yield, because of necessity, to improvisation."" Schwartzmann found the decision outrageous: The burden of proof had not been on arresting officers--whoever they had been--to show they had justifiably detained Terry, but on Terry to prove he had deserved freedom. * * * One clear sign that post-Katrina operations were becoming suffused with war was the dangerous rumor of martial law. It did not help that the city itself reminded many of a war zone. On Sept. 5, a Washington Post reporter caught up with Spc. Frank Atkinson of Arkansas, wearing desert fatigues from his recent Iraq deployment, driving a Humvee through New Orleans streets and holding suspected looters at gunpoint with an M-4 rile. ""It's just so much like Iraq, it's not funny,"" he said, ""except for all the water, and they speak English."" But Gov. Kathleen Blanco had not declared martial law; she knew the Louisiana state Constitution had no provision for the temporary suspension of civilian control. On Aug. 26, three days before Katrina struck, she had declared a state of emergency under the 1993 Louisiana Disaster Act, which granted the governor wide powers to mandate evacuations, seize private property, and deploy the National Guard--powers associated with martial law but nonetheless exercised under civilian authority. Some local officials were less circumspect. Actual and imagined attacks on police officers and racist hearsay about looting, gang violence, and assaults convinced key figures that more stringent measures were necessary. The turning point came on Aug. 30. Deputy Chief Warren Riley, the police department's second in command, passed along to Mayor Ray Nagin a desperate request he'd picked up over police radio: ""We need more ammo."" ""That's what you see in a war movie,"" he recalled later. ""That's not what you hear in urban policing."" (The request would prove to be false.) Later that day, Nagin received word that police officer Kevin Thomas had been shot in the head during a pat-down search of four suspects at a gas station in New Orleans' Algiers neighborhood. ""[I]t made the mayor furious,"" said his aide, Sally Forman. ""And that's when he said, 'We need to declare martial law.' "" Nagin issued the announcement off-handedly in a local radio interview two days later. Would he request martial law as way to bring in federal assets? ""We did that a few days ago,"" he said. State officials quickly stepped in to clarify. On Aug. 30, the state's attorney general issued a statement that martial law had not been declared, since no such term existed in Louisiana law. But some local officials doubled down. Jefferson Parish President Aaron Broussard described his district as ""under martial law, and there's only one marshal: me."" Television news ran with it. ""Tonight,"" CNN pronounced, ""in a rare move, practically unheard of in the United States, martial law declared."" Blanco had been careful to act within the law but contributed to the charged atmosphere with bellicose rhetoric that invoked the threat of war against looters, hoodlums, and other unruly elements. ""[The] National Guard have landed in the city of New Orleans,"" she declared at a press conference on Sept. 1, referring to the arrival of 300 Arkansas guardsmen. ""These troops are fresh back from Iraq, well-trained, experienced, battle-tested, and under my orders to restore order in the streets."" They had M-16s, and the guns were ""locked and loaded."" They knew ""how to shoot and kill"" and were ""more than willing to do so if necessary, and I expect they will."" Word of Blanco's warning ripped through police and guard circles. According to an investigation by ProPublica and the New Orleans Times-Picayune, at one police station, First District Capt. James Scott instructed officers: ""We have authority by martial law to shoot looters."" Rumors of martial law had consequences. The day after what some called Blanco's ""shoot-to-kill"" speech, officers Daniel Warren and Linda Howard were at a police substation on the second floor of an Algiers strip mall. As Howard later testified in Warren's trial, the rookie had armed himself with a semi-automatic rifle from home. She asked him why. ""Do you know we're under martial law?"" he had replied. Two black men, Henry Glover and Bernard Calloway, pulled into the mall's parking lot in a white pickup truck. According to Calloway, Glover was there to pick up goods taken from a department store--candles, pots and pans, baby clothes--that had been left for him in a suitcase. When they got out to retrieve it, Calloway heard someone shout: ""Leave now."" Then came the shot. According to his police report, Warren had opened fire because he felt threatened by what he ""perceived was a weapon"" in Glover's right hand. After Glover was hit, Calloway and Edward King, Glover's brother, gathered around him, and a stranger, Will Tanner, appeared on the scene and offered help. Hoping to get him medical attention, Tanner drove Glover and the others to a nearby elementary school that had been commandeered by police as a base. There, according to an appeals court opinion, they were ""impolitely ordered at gunpoint to exit the car"" by police. A ""verbal and physical altercation"" ensued, ending with Tanner, King, and Calloway in handcuffs, sitting on the ground; Tanner and King testified that the officers assaulted them and used degrading racist slurs. ""The police officers, to the extent that it was on their minds, apparently thought that Glover was dead,"" the court found. ""He may have been.""  Capt. Jeff Winn, the base's commanding officer who had arrived after the men had driven up, assessed the situation, and ordered Officers Dwayne Scheuermann and Greg McRae to remove Glover's body ""to a more secure location away from the school,"" the river side of the levee, located behind the NOPD's Fourth District Police Station. The two men drove Glover's body out. As McRae would testify later, he lit a flare, threw it into the car, and torched it. * * * The storm had struck during a busy week for President Bush. Speaking on the morning of Aug. 28, as waters roiled in the Gulf, Bush briefly thanked government officials ""who have taken this storm seriously"" before quickly pivoting to his main theme, the completion of an Iraqi constitution. On the morning of Aug. 30, the day after Katrina made landfall, he promoted the increasingly controversial war at a naval air station in San Diego. After a brief preamble--Americans' ""hearts and prayers"" went out to Katrina's victims--he segued awkwardly away from those imperiled at home: ""As we deliver relief to our citizens to the South, our troops are defending all our citizens from threats abroad."" On the ground in the Gulf, the previous three years' tensions over disaster preparedness broke into the open. Its staff pummeled by cuts, FEMA failed to deliver on its promises to state and local governments. Emergency managers at all levels of government scrambled to piece together their scattered materials from the Hurricane Pam exercise, which guided local responders but, due to budget deficits, were still full of holes. Chaos erupted over the new National Response Plan; the framework's Catastrophic Incident Annex was never invoked, stifling the federal government's response, and confusions over its new staffing designations tangled rescue and relief efforts. Rationalizing the administration's response, Chertoff told reporters on Sept. 3 that the disaster had ""exceeded the foresight of the planners, and maybe anybody's foresight."" For observers critical of the Bush administration, the destruction of an American city spoke of incompetence and neglect, but also of strained resources and misplaced priorities. Many blamed the federal government's spectacular failure on the administration's boundless war. Bush had had it backward: He hadn't protected the United States by waging war against enemies everywhere; he'd undermined the country's capacity to protect itself against completely predictable risks. ""From Iraq to New Orleans, fund human needs, not the war machine,"" chanted protesters in Washington the night of Sept. 7. At the large demonstration that marched past the White House on Sept. 24, activists held aloft signs reading ""Make Levees, Not War."" It was a first-ever anti-war protest for Leslie Darling, a 60-year-old woman from Cleveland who marched with four friends. The government's negligence, she told a reporter, had ""made clear that while we spend all this money trying to impose our will on other countries, here at home in our own country, we can't take care of each other."" At the same time, reporters began disclosing the ways an all-consuming anti-terrorism agenda had undercut disaster preparedness. ""Changing Structure of FEMA, Emphasis on Terrorism Contributed to Problems,"" ran a Sept. 6 headline in the Wall Street Journal. Faced with these charges, the war's defenders rolled out underequipped responses. Appearing with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in a news conference at the Pentagon on Sept. 7, Gen. Richard B. Myers confronted the accusation of Iraq-related delays. ""Not only was there no delay,"" said Myers, ""I think we anticipated in most cases--not in all cases, but in most cases--the support that was required."" On Sept. 2, ABC's Terry Moran grilled President Bush himself on a storm-torn Biloxi, Mississippi, street: ""What do you say to the people who say there's too much money being spent on Iraq and it's time to bring it home?"" Bush drew parallels between the two crises, even as he tried to neutralize talk of diverted resources. ""We've got a job to defend this country in the war on terror, and we've got a job to bring aid and comfort to the people of the Gulf Coast, and we'll do both,"" he said. ""We've got plenty of resources to do both."" No trade-offs. As investigators dug in, the official story buckled. National Guard Bureau chief Blum conceded that ""arguably"" the guard had been delayed--a day at most, he said--because large segments of Mississippi's 155th Armored Brigade and Louisiana's 256th Infantry Brigade were abroad. But government and media investigations exposed more widespread and significant ways the war had compromised rescue efforts at home. The Bush administration had looked into deploying federal troops as the storm approached, but when the moment came, many of these forces had more distant commitments. The Congressional Research Service revealed that the 101st Airborne Division based at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, with the Army's largest number of transport helicopters, had not been sent to the disaster zone because it was preparing to deploy to Iraq. A senior Army official said the military had been ""reluctant"" to send the 4th Brigade Combat Team of the 10th Mountain Division because it was preparing to deploy to Afghanistan in January. The Pentagon instead sent about 7,500 soldiers from the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Texas, and the 82nd Airborne Division from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, along with Marines from California and North Carolina. But Bush had not ordered federal troops in until Sept. 3, five days after Katrina's landfall in Louisiana. ""If the 1st Cav. and 82nd Airborne had gotten there on time, I think we would have saved some lives,"" said Gen. Julius Becton Jr., a former FEMA director. According to the Congressional Research Service, the problem may have been as much, or more, about scarcities of equipment than personnel. When Katrina hit, the guard had less than 35 percent of its required equipment at hand. More than 101,000 items had been shipped overseas: Shortages included satellite technology, tactical radios, medical equipment, military trucks, and utility helicopters. According to one postmortem, the absence of communications gear hurt most. Deployed guard units had single-channel ground and airborne radio systems, or SINCGARS, used universally among active-duty forces but had turned them over to follow-on forces. With cellphone towers and telephone lines downed in the Gulf, guardsmen had only their tactical radios, which could not talk with SINCGARS. Guardsmen and police had resorted to an improvised system of runners. As Blum insisted to the House Appropriations subcommittee on defense: ""We have to be ready to do homeland defense."" * * * The private contractors were ready. The firms circling the post-Katrina Gulf would have been at home at any bomb-rattled cocktail bar in the Green Zone. As in Iraq, and in line with its broader policy approach, the administration stressed that the private sector would pick up the slack left by dismantled government, avoiding trade-offs by paying corporations to accomplish public ends: clearing trees, removing debris, providing trailer housing, restoring transportation systems, and policing. Familiarly, officials issued most of these contracts with limited or no competitive bidding on the grounds of ""urgent and compelling circumstances."" CH2M and Bechtel, global engineering companies tasked with restoring Iraq's electricity and water, secured new contracts to repair Gulf infrastructure. Just a week after the storm, another company, Fluor, scored a $100 million FEMA contract and positioned about 400 employees on the ground--including its former senior project manager for Iraq--procuring mobile homes and prefab housing. According to Alan Boeckmann, Fluor's chief, ""Our rebuilding work [in Iraq] is slowing down, and this has made some people available to respond to our work in Louisiana."" Asked by the Wall Street Journal, Bechtel and Fluor officials ""declined to discuss comparisons between their work in Iraq and in the Gulf Coast."" Caution made strategic sense. By this point, U.S. contracting in Iraq had become synonymous with graft, fraud, and corruption, and watchdog groups feared similar abuses following Katrina. Danielle Brian, director of Project on Government Oversight, admitted that ""you are likely to see the equivalent of war profiteering--disaster profiteering."" Less than a month after the storm, Richard L. Skinner, DHS's inspector general, had 60 of his staff scrutinizing Katrina contracts. ""We are very apprehensive about what we are seeing,"" he said. The administration, reported the Wall Street Journal, was ""importing many of the contracting practices that were blamed for spending abuses in Iraq."" No stranger to Baghdad streets, but newer to New Orleans, were private security forces. Blackwater sent a helicopter crew to assist the Coast Guard and soon had a lucrative contract guarding FEMA personnel, including those at its disaster recovery center, located in what was likely the most securitized Walmart parking lot in the world. Within weeks, according to the Washington Post, hoteliers, business owners, and wealthy neighborhoods were hiring companies that had thrived ""where war, not nature, has undermined the rule of law."" Texas-based DynCorp International, one of the biggest security contractors in Iraq, had provided Afghan President Hamid Karzai's security detail. The disembarking of private armies in the Gulf raised some alarms. ""Ask any American if they want thugs from a private, for-profit company with no official law-enforcement training roaming the streets of their neighborhoods,"" said Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois congresswoman. Some flagged the impracticality of hiring expensive private security forces--Blackwater charged $950 per day per contractor--in a region teeming with nonprivatized troops and police. ""It strikes me ... that that may not be the best use of money,"" said Illinois Sen. Barack Obama. Corporate guards, distinguished by polo shirts and khakis, SUVs with tinted windows, and assault weapons, quickly became a fixture of the New Orleans landscape. Some local officials imagined more sustained, boundary-blurring tasks for them. In the spring of 2006, after most of St. Bernard Parish police force was furloughed, Sheriff Pete Tufaro applied for a $70 million FEMA grant to employ a hundred DynCorp contractors as police officers. They would bring in significantly more pay than entry-level policemen but would live alongside regular officers and wear identical uniforms. ""You wouldn't be able to tell the difference between us and them,"" he said. While some officials, businessmen, and homeowners had little difficulty conceiving of Karzai's bodyguards cruising St. Bernard streets, some private-sector guards found the assignment disorienting, at least at first. During an interview with Blackwater contractors in New Orleans, investigative reporter Jeremy Scahill noticed that one of them wore a company ID badge around his neck in a case with ""Operation Iraqi Freedom"" printed on it. ""When they told me [I'm going to] New Orleans,"" the contractor related, ""I said, 'What country is that in?' "" * * * The war outlasted the storm. It was February 2007, nearly a year and a half since the drowning of New Orleans, and guardsmen were still patrolling the city streets. When her house was broken into, Fay Kaufman of New Orleans' Gentilly neighborhood was happy to see them: They investigated, canvassed the area, even lingered to help her feel safe. But it was also unsettling. ""It's a little eerie, I guess, at this point in time, to have to depend on the National Guard,"" she said. The New Orleans Police Department had imploded during the storm. Many of its officers had fled and been fired for desertion. Recruiting and training new officers had gone slowly. Following a surge of violence in June 2006, Nagin asked Blanco to reassign 300 guardsmen and 60 state troopers to the city. On June 20, the first soldiers of Task Force Gator arrived downtown, under the command of Brig. Gen. Ben Soileau, who had led no-fly zone operations over Iraq. They were assigned to the worst-hit, least populated parts of the city, allowing police officers to concentrate elsewhere. They had the power to detain suspects but required city police officers to make formal arrests. Guard troops worked hard to convey to city residents that they came in peace, to protect rather than harm. The guard tried where possible to assign troops with experience as military or civilian police and applied techniques common to counterinsurgency manuals: win hearts and minds, gather intelligence, isolate threats. Soldiers unloaded groceries, fixed lawn mowers, and gave children soccer balls emblazoned with the insignia for the Army's 1st Cavalry Division, just as they had done in Iraq. Speaking with active-duty guardsmen in June 2007, the Times-Picayune noted that they saw ""no end in sight to the deployment."" It spoke to both the guard's efforts and the NOPD's reputation as corrupt, racist, and violent that, given few options, many returnees to the city preferred the military. ""We were welcomed with open arms,"" recalled Master Sgt. Chris Ahner of the Louisiana Air National Guard. Guardsmen would be patrolling devastated neighborhoods, and people would offer them grilled meat from open-pit barbecues on their front lawns. ""When they were eating, we were eating,"" he said. Rapper and documentarian Kimberly Rivers-Roberts said the guard had better intentions than the NOPD--""it couldn't get worse."" ""[R]ight away they weren't treating us like we were so, you know ... in Iraq and we were the enemy."" Still, over time, she said, the police had managed to turn well-meaning guardsmen away from what she called the ""U.S. citizen approach"" and toward the ""you're-the-enemy approach"": Shakedowns and intimidation recalled the bad old days. According to guard records, Task Force Gator assisted the NOPD in arresting approximately 9,000 people, many of them nonviolent offenders, funneling them into a criminal justice system notorious for its overcrowded jails, procedural jam-ups, neglect of prisoner health, and exploitative work-release programs. Nearly two years after Katrina, New Orleans had the highest incarceration rate of any major American city, more than twice the national average. Blanco initially agreed to retain the force through the end of the 2007 hurricane season, but the program was renewed through February 2009. By then, the NOPD had been rebuilt, Louisiana faced a $341 million budget deficit, and state legislators outside the city bristled at the huge outlay for the military policing of New Orleans; Task Force Gator's first installment alone had cost $35 million. The program was canceled. But military and police power would remain joined. In the summer of 2007, state lawmakers passed House Bill 441, which allowed the governor to call out the National Guard ""to assist civil authorities"" without declaring a state of emergency. Praising the guard's work that June, the Times-Picayune wrote that it had made ""a huge contribution to New Orleans' recovery, bringing stability and a sense of security when we needed it most."" Terry Burton's family did not agree. The 53-year-old black man had resided in the Lower 9th Ward, where his family had lived since the 1940s. To neighbors, he was a generous, outgoing man with a booming laugh who would help you plant your garden and seemed able to fix anything. Mental illness had kept Burton from holding down regular work, and he'd survived on a monthly disability check and the support of relatives. He'd had run-ins with the law. In December 2006, he was arrested for drug possession. Unable to post bond, he had spent two months in jail but was never charged. At around 1 a.m. on March 8, 2007, troops on patrol saw Burton riding a bicycle in front of his home, holding a hacksaw and ""behaving oddly."" According to their account, they climbed out of their vehicle to speak to him, and he brandished a knife and hurled a piece of broken glass, which cut one sergeant's arm. Burton ran into his home, and they followed him with police backup. Inside, he pointed what the authorities thought was a rifle. A guardsman shot Burton several times in the chest, killing him. It turned out to be a rusted BB gun. Citing Burton's ""bizarre"" behavior, guard and police officials decided the shooting was justified. Family members didn't believe police accounts. They maintained Burton had never been violent or carried weapons. Critics emphasized Burton's abandonment by the city's shuttered mental health system. They pointed out that funds had somehow been made available to keep a small army on the streets but not to reopen clinics. The night after Burton's death, his relatives held a candlelight vigil outside his home and demanded a full investigation. Ada Burns, his niece, insisted the community needed help. ""We need services, not weapons,"" she said. There were trade-offs."	The Untold Story of the Iraq War's Disastrous Toll on the City of New Orleans
28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/a_leaked_script_reveals_what_trump_s_black_church_event_is_really_about.html	"On Saturday, Donald Trump will visit a black church in Detroit, his first stop at a black venue in this campaign. But he won't hold a rally or a freewheeling discussion. Instead, he'll sit down for a question-and-answer session with Bishop Wayne T. Jackson of the church Great Faith Ministries International. The questions won't come as a surprise. Team Trump requested them ahead of time, which isn't uncommon for events like this one. What is unusual, however, is that Trump also has a script. As Yamiche Alcindor reports for the New York Times, Trump's campaign ""prepared lengthy answers for the submitted questions, consulting black Republicans to make sure he says the right things."" The Times has the script, and for something tailored to Trump, it's tame. The Trump on paper there is sedate and milquetoast, with answers that are unresponsive to black American's broad concerns. This is because he's not talking to black Americans. ""What would your administration do to bring down the racial tension that is in our country?"" asks Jackson in the excerpt provided by the Times, prefacing his question with a reference to the 2015 shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, where a white gunman killed nine black worshippers at Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. The response from ""Trump""? ""Our best hope for erasing racial tensions in America is to work toward a color-blind society. In business, we hire, retain and award based on merit. In society, however, we have divisions that can only be eliminated if we have equal opportunity and then equal access to programs and institutions that will lift all people in the country."" None of this speaks to the worries and anxieties held by millions of black Americans, which are intimately tied to race. Seventy percent of blacks point to racial discrimination as an obstacle to getting ahead, according to a recent survey from the Pew Research Center. When asked about dealings with the police, with banks, and on the job, large majorities of blacks say they receive worse treatment on account of racism. To these Americans, Trump's call for ""colorblindness"" is a nonanswer. The same goes for his response to a later question from Jackson: ""Mr. Trump what is your vision for America? And specifically Black America? If you repeal Obama care what is your plan to provide health care and medicine to those who can't afford it, yet need it the most?"" ""If we are to Make America Great Again,"" says ""Trump"" in his scripted response, ""we must reduce, rather than highlight, issues of race in this country. I want to make race disappear as a factor in government and governance."" Again, this is just unresponsive to the fact that race is indeed a factor, often to the detriment of black Americans. Addressing that fact requires a government that is cognizant of ongoing racial discrimination and the legacy of past racism. Trump's formulation is a nonstarter, albeit a familiar one, that shares DNA with Chief Justice John Roberts' 2007 declaration, ""The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.""* But the most revealing part of the script lies in one of Jackson's questions, not Trump's answers. Before asking about perceptions of the Republican Party among black voters, Jackson says this: ""In 2008 and 2012 we had two Republican Candidates John McCain and Mitt Romney and neither one of them came to Detroit, or any urban area that I can remember to even address the concerns of our community. First, I would like to commend you for coming to our community as a Republican Candidate."" In Jackson's statement you see the point of this exercise. The goal isn't genuine outreach--Trump has few answers for black voters. He doesn't speak to their concerns or address past controversies, like his ""birtherism,"" which he continues to indulge at rallies with a sly stress of Barack Obama's middle name. No, Trump's goal is to look tolerant, to look patient and gracious while he takes praise from a black religious leader and gives boilerplate about ""equal opportunity."" Once again, Trump's ""black outreach"" isn't outreach to actual black voters. The same message of colorblindness and race-neutrality that falls flat with black voters does gangbusters with white ones. It's white Republicans who say too much attention is paid to race (59 percent, according to Pew), and it's white conservatives (71 percent) who say Obama has made race relations worse. Trump's prejudiced rhetoric has harmed him with some percentage of Republican-leaning voters. What better way to address this gap than to travel to a black church to give a message amenable to those white Republicans? Trump may not convince Americans writ large that he's a racial liberal. But he can mimic the language of a typical Republican on race and racism. And that's the plan. *Correction, Sept. 2, 2016: This article originally misidentified Chief Justice John Roberts as John Robert. (Return.) Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	A Leaked Script Reveals What Trump's Black Church Appearance Is Really About
29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/how_trump_sucks_up_to_minorities.html	"Donald Trump says he loves minorities. ""Nothing means more to me than working to make our party the home of the African-American vote,"" he told a white crowd in Iowa over the weekend. As evidence, he cited ""what's been happening over the last two weeks and three weeks with me""--a series of speeches in which Trump, according to himself, has been reaching out to blacks and Hispanics. I've watched these speeches. They're a perfect encapsulation of who Trump is. While mouthing platitudes about inclusiveness, he systematically courts certain minorities--or, rather, courts white voters who are skittish about supporting a racist--by pledging to protect them from other minorities. Even when he poses as the candidate of love and unity, Trump reveals himself as the candidate of hostility and division. Trump's suck-up to minorities began on Aug. 16, when Kellyanne Conway, a pollster who wanted to make him more broadly palatable, became his campaign manager. That day, speaking in Wisconsin, Trump pledged to ""reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its many ugly forms."" But one form of bigotry became the centerpiece of his pitch to minorities: blaming their troubles on immigrants. ""No community in this country has been hurt worse by Hillary Clinton's immigration and all of her policies than the African-American community,"" Trump told the crowd. He warned that Clinton would allow ""millions of illegal immigrants to come in and take everybody's job, including low-income African Americans."" Trump pretended that he wasn't appealing to prejudice, since he was targeting ""illegal immigrants,"" not immigrants in general. But two days later, speaking in North Carolina, he went after legal immigrants. He blasted Clinton for proposing to allow ""Syrian refugees"" into the United States, flooding the country with Sharia lovers ""who believe in oppressing women, gays, Hispanics, African Americans, and people of different faiths."" To women offended by his past sexist comments, and to gays alarmed by his opposition to same-sex marriage, Trump offered this consolation: At least I'll save you from the Muslims. The next day, Aug. 19, Trump spoke in Michigan. ""The era of division will be replaced with a future of unity, total unity. We will love each other,"" he promised. He contrasted his vision of love with ""the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, who sees communities of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future. Hillary Clinton would rather provide a job to a refugee from overseas than to give that job to unemployed African-American youth."" To Trump, communities of color are more than votes. They are bogeymen and scapegoats. Each community can be played off against others as a criminal menace, a threat to jobs, or a drain on public funds. ""Hillary Clinton's plan would bring in an estimated 620,000 refugees in her first term at a lifetime-benefit cost of some $400 billion,"" Trump told the audience in Michigan. He pledged to ""save countless billions of dollars"" by barring refugees--and to ""invest a portion of the money saved in a jobs program for inner-city youth."" Trump--the man who had blamed President Obama for failing to control black ""thugs,"" and who just two months ago opposed apologizing for a sportscaster's explicitly anti-black statements--professed love for black Americans. ""I'd like to address an issue of great and very deep personal importance to me,"" he declared at a rally in Virginia on Aug. 20. He assured blacks that he would make America ""a totally inclusive country""--unlike Clinton, who, Trump said, would give their jobs to immigrants. But Trump seemed to forget which group he had planned to vilify that day. He condemned Virginia's governor, Terry McAuliffe, for trying to restore voting rights to felons who had served their sentences and had been released from parole or probationary supervision. McAuliffe said the restoration would rectify a century-old Virginia policy designed to disenfranchise blacks. Trump, however, denounced the governor's proposal. ""Hillary Clinton is banking ... on getting thousands of violent felons to the voting booths,"" Trump alleged, eliciting boos from the crowd. ""They are letting people vote in your Virginia election that should not be allowed to vote."" Speaking in Ohio, Texas, and Florida over the next four days, Trump expanded on his indictment. He claimed to be fighting for women, gays, and Latinos, as well as blacks. He pledged to defend these Americans against ""Barack Hussein Obama,"" rich Muslim countries that supported the Clinton Foundation, and troubled Muslim countries that were sending refugees. He also pledged to protect American jobs from ""broken visa programs,"" which sounded like an attack on another avenue of legal immigration. In the past week, Trump has escalated his rhetoric, framing his crackdown on immigration as a civil rights issue. Last Thursday in New Hampshire, he claimed that Clinton ""supports open borders that violate the civil rights of African Americans by giving their jobs to people here unlawfully."" On Saturday in Iowa, he added:"	How Does Trump Suck Up to Minorities? By Scaring Them About Other Minorities.
