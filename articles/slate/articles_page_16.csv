""This fevered pipe dream of Washington, that at the convention they will parachute in some white knight who will save the Washington establishment: It is nothing less than a pipe dream,"" the senator said Monday. ""It ain't gonna happen. If it did, the people would quite rightly revolt."" It's interesting that Cruz is still arguing against the establishment. In recent days, after all, heading into the Wisconsin primary, he has taken to bragging about the breadth of his Republican support. He is quite aware that he's the anti-Trumpers' last best chance, even if some of those anti-Trumpers don't like him. ""Of those 17 original [Republican presidential candidates],"" Cruz told reporters on Monday before taping a Fox News town hall with Megyn Kelly, ""five are supporting this campaign: Rick Perry, Lindsey Graham, Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina, and Wisconsin's own Gov. Scott Walker. When you add to that Sen. Mike Lee and [radio host] Mark Levin, you've got the full spectrum of the Republican Party."" And if you've got the full spectrum of the Republican Party in your pocket, that's going to include the establishment. This does not mean, however, that Cruz is willing to abandon the anti-establishment rhetoric that's gotten him so far. Though the Cruz campaign has repeatedly called for John Kasich to drop out of the race, the Ohio governor provides a useful foil for Cruz. Kasich's continued candidacy represents the treacherous possibility of a moderate, establishment candidate taking over at the convention. Arguing against such a coup is useful to Cruz rhetorically--even when he claims that Kasich's name will never make it to the convention floor. ""There are only two candidates whose names will appear on the ballot [at the convention]: Donald Trump and myself,"" Cruz said. ""Under the rules you have to have won eight states; there are only two candidates who will have met that threshold."" He's referring to Rule 40 of the convention rules, established ahead of the 2012 convention to block Ron Paul's name from being considered. The Cruz and Trump camps will control a vast majority of allocated delegates going into the convention--80 percent, Cruz estimates--and, thus, a vast majority of the delegates on the rules committee. Both campaigns have said they would try to keep the rule on the books to block consideration of Kasich or a Paul Ryan-esque ""white knight"" candidate. ""The nice thing is, Washington doesn't control what happens,"" Cruz said, ""the delegates control what happens, and the delegates are elected by the people."" The 2012 rules shouldn't be changed ""because Washington has been unhappy with how the people are voting."" ""Now that the rule is viewed as inconvenient to the Washington establishment, they want to get rid of it,"" he added. ""But you know what? What's good for the goose is good for the gander. If you want to win, win at the ballot box."" And during the town hall with Kelly, he made the criticism against Kasich, at least, more explicit: ""If you lose 49 states, you cannot be the nominee."" The problem with Cruz portraying himself as the main outsider, man-of-the-people candidate whom the establishment would be angling to screw over at the convention is that he's not. That would be Donald Trump. Here there is some conflict in Cruz's position. When the idea of Kasich or a ""white knight"" being considered at the convention comes up, Cruz says that would be a ridiculous rejection of the people's will. But when he's asked about whether the leading vote-, state-, and delegate-winner of the contest should have the inside track to the nomination, Cruz demurs, saying the delegates can do whatever they want. Since Cruz's and Trump's loyalists will control the rules committee, it's likely that they will have the ability to keep the race as a contest between himself and Trump. In that case, Cruz will officially be the establishment preference, and his competition will be the leading delegate-getter of the primaries. The ""people"" might ""quite likely revolt"" over that, too. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 Republican primary."	Ted Cruz Can't Decide if He's the Anti-Establishment Candidate or Not

Consider the humble shipping container, which allows importers and exporters to transport standardized loads from trucks and railcars onto mammoth ocean-going vessels. In The Box, Marc Levinson describes how this seemingly unremarkable innovation made global economic integration possible. But at the dawn of containerized shipping, in the mid-1950s, people were a lot more excited about Sputnik, and the tantalizing prospect of human colonies on the moon. No one gave much thought to the possibility that a bunch of boxes would drive a massive, decades-long economic boom in East Asia, or would hasten the decline of manufacturing employment in the United States. Are there any technological innovations in our own time that might have a similarly enormous effect, for better or for worse? There is reason to be skeptical. Robert J. Gordon, a Northwestern University economist legendary for his brilliance and crankiness, argues that the era of robust American economic growth has come to an end. Gordon's view, in very simplified terms, is that today's technologists are giving us new chat software, immersive video games, and all manner of cold-pressed juices rather than truly growth-enhancing innovations like, say, the internal-combustion engine or penicillin. I happen to believe that Gordon is being too hard on cold-pressed juices. What's not to like? But he does have a point. Smartphones have made Apple's biggest shareholders fabulously rich, but have they done as much to boost our productivity as, say, electric lighting or the automobile? Productivity growth is the ultimate source of the increases in our collective prosperity, and productivity growth has been maddeningly sluggish for years. But before we give in to despair, with only a wide variety of delicious juices to soothe us, there is one technology on the horizon that has at least as much potential as containerized shipping. It's called, rather embarrassingly, ""holoportation."" Over the coming decades, I suspect it will do to trade in services what containerized shipping has done to trade in manufactured goods. What is holoportation? Basically, the mad scientists at Microsoft Research have cooked up a way to transmit pretty convincing three-dimensional holograms of friends, family, and (here's the important part) co-workers in real time across vast distances. Most impressively, you can interact with these holographic projections, almost as though you were physically in the same place. If I were capable of explaining it any better than that, I would be in a garage building my own holoportation device. The video below gives you some sense of the technology's potential, and how it works in practice. Lest I be accused of pro-Microsoft propaganda, there are a number of companies driving innovation in virtual reality. Oculus, Samsung, and HTC are all releasing commercial VR products that are getting better and cheaper all the time. Though virtual-reality technology has been centered around gaming thus far, it is only a matter of time before other, more prosaic applications gain ground. Last summer, Christopher Mims of the Wall Street Journal waxed lyrical on VR's potential, going so far as to anticipate a time when we'll use holoportation-style tech ""not because it's an adequate replacement for meeting someone face to face, but because it's actually better."" Mims interviewed Stanford University's Virtual Human Interaction Lab's Jeremy Bailenson, who told him that the goal of his work was ""ending unnecessary travel that you feel like you had to do for some implicit cultural reason."" In other words, Bailenson hoped to use VR technology to bring about what journalist Frances Cairncross dubbed ""the death of distance"" in her 1997 book of the same name. Yes, I know that techno-enthusiasts have been anticipating the death of distance for decades, going back to the telegraph and the telephone. And yet, even as we load our pockets with ever more fantastical gewgaws, we travel as much if not more than we did when the only way to talk to someone was to open your mouth a reasonable distance from her ears. Despite the proliferation of Internet-enabled communication, dense cities--places where people gather to share ideas--have grown more attractive rather than less. So the death of distance is just a myth, is it not? Not quite. The advent of new communications technologies has drastically lowered the costs associated with collaborating with people living elsewhere. If you're working in Los Angeles, you might want to visit your colleagues in Kansas City a few times a year. But instantaneous communication via Skype or Slack allows you to sustain connections in between those visits, and to get meaningful work done. The promise of VR is that it can offer an experience a bit better and more immersive than the communications technologies we now consider run of the mill, and that it will allow you to get away with flying just a little bit less. Given growing concerns about the dangers posed by climate change, it's not hard to imagine a world in which constant travel will be seen as scandalously irresponsible on environmental grounds alone, not to mention the fact that it can be exhausting and dispiriting. But VR technology isn't just going to shape the lives of the global jetset. In the years to come, it may well transform our immigration debate. Advocates of large-scale immigration argue that U.S. workers and consumers benefit from it in a number of ways, and they're right. Less-skilled migrant workers often fill jobs that native-born workers would only take on for relatively high wages, thus making a wide array of services more available to working- and middle-class consumers. Skilled immigrant workers, meanwhile, can collaborate with skilled native workers in ways that bring substantial benefits to both. But immigrant workers aren't simply economic cogs, as George Borjas argues in his forthcoming We Wanted Workers. They are also human beings who fall ill, and who need to meet their own basic needs and those of their families. While consumers might welcome the prospect of paying less for restaurant meals, tutoring, or other services that immigrant workers can provide, we might be concerned when the low incomes that immigrant-headed households earn aren't enough to provide them with a decent standard of living. Virtual reality technology provides a potential solution: What if VR allows consumers in affluent countries to enjoy all of the benefits associated with a low-wage immigrant workforce while freeing them from bearing the costs associated with providing immigrant workers and their families with Medicaid, SNAP, and the earned-income tax credit? If that all sounds rather sinister, keep in mind that the wages one can earn in the world's rich countries will go much further in the world's poor ones. That is why so many citizens of poor countries seek their fortunes abroad: Many of them simply want to send money to their families back home. The World Bank has found that the remittances that immigrants in rich countries send to their relatives dwarf the sum total of foreign aid. What if it were possible to earn in a rich country, where the costs of housing and medical care and other necessities tend to be quite high, while spending in a poor one, where these costs tend to be far lower? That is the strategy of rich-country expats who take savings accumulated in England or Arizona to finance lavish lifestyles in Costa Rica or Thailand. And of course there are many migrants who spend a few years in Dubai or Dallas and then return home to build more prosperous lives. VR technology could greatly increase opportunities for people, including those who live in the world's poorest countries, to engage in this kind of geographical arbitrage. If this sounds too kooky to be true, you might want to take a look at the much-ballyhooed education start-up Udacity. For $299 per month, you can sign up for Udacity's Nanodegree Plus program, which will train you to be learn the tools of a particular software programming trade at your own pace. If you don't land a job within six months of graduating, Udacity will refund 100 percent of your tuition. How can Udacity afford to pull this off? The company employs paid graders around the world, who do the labor-intensive work of evaluating projects submitted by students. People with the skills and know-how to grade these projects are in high demand, and Udacity couldn't offer such low prices if it hired only Americans to do this work. By global standards, the U.S. is a high-productivity, high-wage society, and people who know software have many other lucrative employment opportunities. So Udacity hires people in India and other foreign workers with roughly the same skills. Indians who work for Udacity while remaining in India find that wages that are low by U.S. standards can provide them with quite comfortable incomes, not to mention the fact that staying home means they can remain close to their families. Udacity employs many highly skilled Americans, and its services help many more Americans get good middle-class jobs. But just as the iPhone is the product of American designers and Chinese assembly-line workers, Udacity is globalizing the supply chain of education. It's not the first company to do so and it certainly won't be the last. If VR proves to be as big a deal as containerized shipping, we'll soon be living in a very different world. Brainy people in poor countries will no longer have to abandon their homelands to improve their standard of living, as they can do the jobs of the future wherever they can set up their VR rigs. Consumers in rich countries will gain access to cheaper medical care and educational services, among many other things, as foreign doctors and teachers start offering their services via VR. All of our debates over occupational licensing and teachers unions will seem pretty quaint when Piotr from Gdansk can use holoportation to remodel our house by remotely controlling a man-sized Constructionbot. Naturally, the advent of what we might call ""virtual immigration"" will put pressure on workers competing with these virtual immigrants, just as automation and the offshoring of manufacturing has put pressure on domestic manufacturing workers, and just as non-virtual immigration puts pressure on native and foreign-born U.S. workers. But VR is advancing at breakneck speed, and all the regulatory barriers in the world aren't going to keep consumers from making use of service workers in other countries who are willing to do the same jobs for less. The real question is whether we will embrace virtual immigration as an opportunity or see it as a threat."

The truth about these dysfunctional, downscale communities is that they deserve to die."" His colleague David French echoed the assessment. ""Simply put, Americans are killing themselves and destroying their families at an alarming rate. No one is making them do it. The economy isn't putting a bottle in their hand."" In the past, this is how conservatives have talked about struggling blacks. If inner cities and rural black communities were poor and dysfunctional, it was because of cultural deficiencies, not broad economic problems. With more effort, went the argument, they could overcome economic isolation and social stigma. And the evidence was success among low-income white Americans who'd overcome their station. But now, more whites than ever are sinking toward the bottom, living in the same conditions that have faced black Americans for decades. And suddenly, conservatives are talking about them in the same way. We've seen this dynamic before. ""The chief characteristic of Rag Tag and Bobtail, however, is laziness. They are about the laziest two-clogged animals that walk erect on the face of the Earth,"" wrote Alabama lawyer and secessionist Daniel R. Hundley in Social Relations in Our Southern States, a widely cited volume published on the eve of the Civil War. ""Rag Tag and Bobtail"" is Hundley's moniker for the poor whites of the South, whom he also calls ""poor white trash."" He describes them as ""working habitually in company with Negroes,"" and in some sense as being black themselves. ""Even their motions are slow, and their speech is a sickening drawl, worse a deal sight than the most down-eastern of all the Down-Easters while their thoughts and ideas seem likewise to creep along at a snail's pace. All they seem to care for, is, to live from hand to mouth; to get drunk, provided they can do so without having to trudge too far after their liquor,"" Hundley wrote. ""We do not believe the worthless ragamuffins would put themselves to much extra locomotion to get out of a shower of rain; and we know they would shiver all day with cold, with wood all around them, before they would trouble themselves to pick it up and build a fire."" Hundley is just one man, but there's no question these attitudes were common among the Southern fancy class. In one euphemism-rich passage in an 1854 treatise, Henry Hughes, a Confederate colonel and sociologist, wrote in aspirational terms of a system of American slavery in which all races participate, a sort of ""I Have a Dream"" speech in reverse: ""Warranteeism without the ethnical qualification is that to which every society of one race must progress."" Among members of the elite, the teetering of the social structure established by slavery was understood in part as a sort of blackening of poor white people. There was something inherent in this class of white people, the thinking went, that accounted for--and justified--their lowly station and their ""dysfunctional, downscale communities."" Class anxieties had been racialized. The fear among white laborers--North and South--had less to do with a flattening of the lower social strata than it did with their outright inversion. This was put to vivid political use. In the lead-up to the 1864 presidential election, the New York World--one of the most pro-Southern papers in a generally pro-Southern city--published a series of anti-Lincoln stories, editorials, and lithographs. One of them was titled ""Miscegenation Ball."" In the top right corner of the illustration was a banner that read ""Universal Freedom. One Constitution. One Destiny."" In the background, illustrators placed a portrait of Abraham Lincoln. And in the foreground, a mixed-race group of white men and black women danced and celebrated. The message was simple: If you re-elect Lincoln, you'll make miscegenation the law. A later lithograph, titled ""Miscegenation or the Millennium of Abolition,"" was more explicit. Viewed from left to right, it depicted President Lincoln bowing to a mixed-race couple (a black woman in dress and a white man in formal wear), a black man and his black wife riding a carriage drawn by a white man, and two black men, each embracing a white woman. Again, there's no question of the message: Under President Lincoln, this is America's future. It's clear that, with these cartoons, the New York World was playing on the disgust of its white readers. But it was also playing on an old fear. Fear that America would become Saint-Domingue writ large. Fear that abolition would bring a world turned upside down, as the hierarchy that placed whites on the top and blacks at the bottom collapsed under the strain of war and emancipation. Lincoln won re-election (thanks to a massive margin with Union soldiers that required no small amount of coercion and intimidation), but this racist fear would remain, grow, and curdle into violent anger. Lincoln's assassin, John Wilkes Booth, was a Confederate sympathizer throughout the war. But he made his fateful choice upon hearing Lincoln voice support for black suffrage. ""That means nigger citizenship. Now, by God, I'll put him through,"" cursed Booth as he stood in the audience. ""That is the last speech he will ever make."" In the aftermath of the Civil War, this fear of racial inversion would drive ex-Confederates to form anti-black militias and vigilante groups, devoted to terrorizing emancipated black Americans and re-establishing the old hierarchy. What Southern whites called ""Redemption"" in the 1870s and 1880s, blacks understood as an attempt to re-enslave them, or at least to keep them in conditions akin to slavery. All of this gets at one of the key ideas in my look at Barack Obama and the rise of Donald Trump. The ascension of a black American to the nation's most prestigious office--coupled with the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression--produced a jolt of material and racial anxieties for millions of working white Americans. In the past, whiteness brought a measure of social stability. Even when poor, whites would never be at the bottom of America's hierarchy--they would never be niggers. Suddenly, that wasn't as true, as the downturn destroyed jobs and brought ""inner-city"" social ills to white rural and suburban enclaves. Moreover, the visible rise of a nonwhite elite (both black and Latino) challenged notions of any kind of social superiority. Now, perhaps, they were at the bottom, or close to it. This isn't the same fear and anger that put Lincoln in the grave and stopped Reconstruction from reaching its potential, but it's related. It rhymes. And while our period of economic crisis and rapid racial change is different from previous ones, it has--like its forebears--sparked a similar movement of the anxious and resentful, drawn from working- and middle-class whites who view themselves as a bulwark against the seemingly idle and dependent, even as conservative elites begin to view them in the same way. We had Redemption. We had the second Ku Klux Klan. We had George Wallace. Now we have Trump. The difference now is that this group of whites isn't as large as it was. And if the GOP weren't so reliant on white voters--that is, if it weren't such a dysfunctional party--Trump might have stayed at the margins. But the GOP's extreme conservatism--inculcated and heightened in the state houses and governors' mansions where it has complete control--and contempt for basic norms of politics has given Trump (and Trump-like figures) space to grow and flourish. And while Trump is still a long shot for the presidency--the larger American electorate is different from the Republican Party base--that doesn't mean he can't do real damage to our political institutions. With the outbreak of violence at Trump events around the country--spurred on by the candidate himself--it's already happening. It's hard to know where this leads. But if the past is any guide, this backlash of anger and nativism will get fiercer before it burns out--if it ever does. One thing is clear, however: These voters aren't entirely wrong. The inversion of status, or at least a dramatic decline in status, is happening. National Review did us the service of making that explicit. The big question--perhaps the single largest question of American history--is whether this will inspire empathy and fellow feeling with minorities or just become tinder for the ongoing racial reaction.

3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/cnn_s_anderson_cooper_was_cranky_and_donald_trump_was_a_disaster.html	"""My greatest failing is sometimes I don't follow up,"" Anderson Cooper said during CNN's town hall in Milwaukee on Tuesday night, a week before the state's primary. Cooper was jokily alluding to an earlier question from an audience member who had asked Ted Cruz about the candidate's biggest weakness. But Cooper's coverage of the 2016 GOP primary has indeed been a fine example of not following up, one of many journalistic sins that he and his network have committed in their pursuit of Donald Trump and the ratings he brings. But Tuesday night was different: Cooper found--it would be too generous to say recovered--his footing, and the network delivered a pretty solid event. After months of softball interviews, Cooper went after Ted Cruz and (especially) Donald Trump with forensic skill. In response, Trump flailed and crumbled, the bigot and misogynist in him laid bare. Will it matter? Probably not. But at the very least, at a moment when his colleagues in the political media have been fitted for hair shirts over their alleged enabling of Trump, Cooper was able to elicit from the Republican front-runner his most disastrous performance of the campaign. Cooper started by asking Cruz, the first interviewee, about the battery charge filed against Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. Cooper bird-dogged Cruz on the subject of his obscene proposal to ""patrol"" Muslim neighborhoods. And Cooper didn't let Cruz off the hook for the hypocrisy of his anti-Trump stance, pointing out that Cruz did nothing but cozy up to Trump for months. When the audience took over the questioning, Cooper kept interrupting Cruz's filibustering, noting that the Texas senator had called for the ""carpet-bombing"" of ISIS and trying to pin him down on an answer about whether he wanted ground troops to fight the extremist group. Trump came out second, and Cooper began by challenging him about his campaign's shifting story on Lewandowski. Cooper could have badgered him a little more thoroughly--Trump's people initially said that nothing had happened at all, only later settling on the story that the reporter had actually posed a threat to Trump(!)--but Cooper was able to coax from the candidate an honest portrayal of a dishonest bully. Trump seemed surprisingly ill at ease, sputtering and interrupting Cooper. Cooper then turned to Trump's retweet of an unflattering photo of Ted Cruz's wife. When Trump responded that ""he started it,"" referring to Cruz, Cooper shot back that this was a 5-year-old's answer. Trump seemed taken aback by the ferocity of Cooper's questioning, changing his story uncomfortably. Trump was also asked by an audience member about stigmatizing minority groups after terrorist attacks. When Trump ignored the question (going off about Iraq, among other things), Cooper pressed him, something he did with the other candidates as well. (There were exceptions to the good questions: One Trump supporter more or less asked the candidate to talk about how rich he was.) Who knows why Cooper changed his tune Tuesday night, but he was sharp and pointed and on his game. Asked by an audience member for the three most important functions of the federal government, Trump cited education. Cooper pounced, asking how that fit with Trump's previous condemnation of Common Core. Cooper also pressed Trump several times on something he has so far received a free ride on: his constant claim that he funds his own campaign, despite having a large ""donate"" button on the campaign's website. The endless commentary in recent days about the amount of blame the press should shoulder for Trump's rise has tended to focus too much on the media's impact and less on its proper, adversarial role. Cooper's fine performance Tuesday night may not be a sign that anything is going to change, nor is it likely to bring down or even dent Trump's campaign. But Cooper did his job well, and he did it irascibly, and Trump's awful performance was more likely a consequence than a coincidence. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 presidential election."	CNN's Anderson Cooper Was Cranky, and Donald Trump Was a Disaster
4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/does_bernie_sanders_have_momentum_now.html	"After a very good weekend in which fortune fell upon Bernie Sanders like a bird alighting on a podium, you could be forgiven for thinking the Sanders campaign has momentum. On Saturday, he won Washington state's caucus with 72 percent of the vote. He won Hawaii's with 70 percent of the vote. And he won Alaska's with a whopping 82 percent of the vote. This follows victories in Idaho and Utah, where Sanders beat Hillary Clinton with 60-point margins. And if the past is any indication, the Sanders campaign will turn those wins into massive cash donations, fueling his efforts in Wisconsin (which votes next week), New York, and California. Given his success, his fundraising, and the sheer enthusiasm for his campaign, it's easy to look at the past week and believe that Sanders is on the cusp of a new dawn--that soon he'll turn a corner toward victory. ""Don't let anybody tell you we can't win the nomination or win the general election,"" he told supporters. ""We're going to do both of those things."" In a conference call with reporters on Monday, Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver echoed this point. ""We have had overwhelming wins in six of the last primaries,"" he said. ""We are on the path to victory and there is a path to do so,"" he continued, emphasizing the campaign's strong fundraising. Likewise, said senior strategist Tad Devine, ""Where we compete with [Clinton], we have a very good chance of beating her."" Sanders' victories are impressive, but to repeat myself, you don't win the primary with states; you win it with delegates. And even after Saturday, Sanders trails behind Clinton in ""pledged"" delegates awarded through voting. Before Saturday, the former secretary of state led Sanders by 294 pledged delegates. After Saturday, she led by 259. With just under 2,000 pledged delegates left in the contest, Sanders needs 55 percent of remaining delegates to win a majority. If you add ""superdelegates"" (Democratic lawmakers and officials) to the total, then Sanders needs 66 percent of remaining delegates to score a majority. What about his momentum? you say. Forward movement and the sense of impending victory is a powerful force for raising money and winning coverage. But barring something extraordinary, it doesn't change the landscape. Sanders had tremendous momentum after his surprise win in Michigan, but it didn't change the outcomes in Ohio, Missouri, Florida, North Carolina, and Illinois, where Clinton won--as largely expected--on the strength of her ties to black and Latino Democrats. In turn, this didn't shift the outcome in either Idaho or Utah, contests where Sanders held the advantage. Not only does Sanders perform well in states like Washington, where the Democratic electorate is whiter than average; he also does best in caucuses, which reward the enthusiasm he generates in spades. The next fight is in Wisconsin, where, momentum or not, it's a pick 'em. With its colleges and universities and its long history of left-wing politics and labor organizing, Sanders is a natural fit for the state that rose in mass protest after Republican Gov. Scott Walker ended collective bargaining for public-sector employees. On the other side, Clinton is still strong with black voters, who constitute a significant portion of the state's Democratic electorate. And if her performance in other Midwestern states is any indication, Clinton should do well with moderates as well as partisan Democrats. After Wisconsin, the race takes on a familiar pattern. There are caucuses in Wyoming and North Dakota, where Sanders should do well. And there are primaries in New York, California, and New Jersey, where voters will allocate most of the remaining delegates. These states have larger than average black and Latino populations, which is to say that--like Florida and Illinois--they look like Clinton territory. If Sanders has had an impressive run of wins in the last two weeks of March, Clinton will likely have a similar run in April and May. The difference is that it will deliver a critical burst of delegates, further padding her margin over Sanders. None of this is to dismiss Sanders or his support. But at this stage, the primary is static. There are states that favor Sanders, and there are states that favor Clinton. The latter hold more pledged delegates than the former. After Nevada, the Sanders campaign pursued a ""state-win strategy,"" designed to score as many states as possible. But they didn't need states; they needed delegates. Now, they face a hill that's almost too steep to climb. Read more Slate coverage of the Democratic primary."	Does Bernie Sanders Have Momentum Now?
5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/what_do_trump_supporters_think_about_climate_change_i_went_to_a_rally_and.html	"At the end of his hourlong dialogue Monday with the Washington Post's editorial board, Donald Trump said ""our biggest form of climate change we should worry about is nuclear weapons."" As Trumpish climate change howlers go, this was relatively informed and sober-minded. In the past, he has repeatedly called human-caused global warming a ""myth"" and a ""hoax."" He once suggested that ""global warming was created by and for the Chinese,"" which he now says was just a joke. Trump lives in an unreality of his own making. But what about his supporters? On Saturday, the Republican front-runner visited my town, Tucson, Arizona, so I decided to go out and chat with folks waiting in line to see him. In a dozen or so interviews--which are obviously in no way representative of the national electorate or even of Trump supporters in general--I found many Trump fans who disagree with him on climate. If there's one thing I learned from the experience, it's that you absolutely cannot guess a person's views on climate change unless you ask him or her. About half of the respondents in my small sample size seemed to accept mainstream climate science--the climate is changing, and human activity is the primary cause. That might dismay some, but it's more than I was expecting. This was a Trump rally, remember. My micro-sample accords with the gradually escalating alarm with which Americans view the issue. A recent Gallup poll found 65 percent of Americans now view human activity as the primary cause of global warming, the highest in Gallup's 16-year history of asking this question, with 40 percent of Republicans now saying they're worried a ""great deal/fair amount"" about the issue. Take the response of a man in Tucson wearing oversized Mardi Gras beads, flashing sunglasses, and an Uncle Sam hat with a turkey on it. I'd asked him, ""What are your thoughts on climate change?"" His quick response: ""It sucks."" His companion, Karina Roberts, who was wearing a European football-style scarf with ""UNITED STATES"" in bold letters, went on to give a several-minute-long disquisition on why climate change deserved to be ""up there"" in the national conversation. ""In some ways, [Trump] may not be in line with climate change, which is just so important, but we can only hope that any of the candidates would put that ... on the top of the list, but there's so many things that need to be addressed as well,"" Roberts told me. ""At least, at a minimum, Mr. Trump is being able to do a lot of things without being bought."" Still, if given the choice between a candidate who was in favor of climate action and one who wasn't, Roberts allowed that it could make the difference on whom to vote for. Another attendee, John, seemed to support Trump specifically because he might take bold action on climate change. John told me ""climate change is obviously a topic we need to take incredibly seriously. If we don't take it incredibly seriously, the human race is going to find out really quickly what can happen."" When asked where Trump fits in, he said, ""Well, Trump just seems like the kind of guy that once he decides what it is that needs to be done, then he'll put his best foot forward and try to accomplish it."" One Trump supporter, Wayne, said climate change has ""definitely been going on for a long time ... we caused it"" and was dismayed that the candidate is ""not as informed as he should be"" on climate. ""The enlightenment of the whole political agenda has to happen,"" he said, before we can expect leaders to break away from their connections to the oil industry that may be steering their views on climate. One man, Eric, said he supports Trump for military reasons but seemed resigned to the issue of climate change: ""I don't really know, honestly, that there is much that we can do about that specifically--we've already had so much effect."" Others were more typically in line with views you might expect to encounter at a Trump rally. One man, Craig, when asked his thoughts on climate change, said ""there is none"" and then launched into claims that Al Gore created the threat as a hoax--not to mention that Gore still flies on airplanes. Another man, Ted, told me he thought there was a conspiracy among those who think humans have a strong role in climate change: ""It's questionable if it's even happening. I'm not saying it's not, but I've seen some things that it looks like it might be, but I don't know if it is or not. I like to make my own choices and see things and go from there."" But he was clear that he didn't think humans were responsible. ""God is in charge of all of this stuff. We can do anything we can, but he could have destroyed us many times around. ... We have to have a balance of the environment and business."" One woman, Nancy, dressed in a neon-yellow shirt with hand-painted letters spelling ""Trump"" on it, was obviously a supporter. She confirmed this to me, interjecting, ""And I'm educated!"" When asked for her thoughts on climate change, she sighed and said, ""You really want to know? It's BS. I don't believe in it. I'm sorry. I just don't. It's been proven it's a bunch of hooey--that's my opinion."" Feeling adventurous, I decided to follow up, asking if she agreed with Trump's past statements suggesting climate change was a hoax perpetrated by China to wreck our economy. ""Yes, they maneuver the currency, absolutely, 100 percent--and if anyone can deal with them, he's the guy."" Despite these examples, most people I talked to seemed to be attending the rally out of a genuine desire to learn more about Trump's positions, though there were some that, of course, already had their minds made up. Take two friends, Lloyd and Nick, who were wearing ""Make America Great Again"" hats but said they were still ""on the fence"" as to whether they support Trump. ""We're here to see where the Trump supporters are at, we're middle ground right now,"" said Lloyd. On climate change, though, Lloyd was more certain: ""I think it's a big money grab, personally."" His friend agreed: ""There's probably some kind of climate change that's happening, as far as the heat numbers and everything, but I do also agree that some people are taking advantage of that. ... I'm all about saving the environment and recycling and everything, but I feel like some people are really taking advantage of it."" The responses I encountered, even the more scientifically grounded ones, all seemed to reflect some element of the Trumpish mindset. There was the paranoia and the fear that someone foreign is getting one over on America. There was also the notion that, even if Trump says now that climate change is a hoax, he'll come around and fix everything eventually because he's a smart guy who Gets Things Done. Still, I came away from the experience with a gently buoyed faith in humanity. It was comforting in a weird way to find that Trump's appeal on this issue seems mostly a matter of affect, not policy. At least some of America is still in touch with reality.  Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 presidential election."	What Do Trump Supporters Think About Climate Change?

Before he entered the scene, many of us assumed our politics were in the gutter. We'd passed through Nixon, Gary Hart, Willie Horton, and Bill Clinton's impeachment. We saw the 2000 whisper campaign about John McCain fathering a black child and the spectacle of vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin whipping crowds into a volkisch frenzy. Trump, however, reminds us that even in the midst of all this debasement, certain norms remained in place, invisible and taken for granted until he started going after them with a sledgehammer. See, for example, the trashing of Heidi Cruz at the hands of Trump and his supporters. I'm not just talking about Trump's Twitter mockery of Ted Cruz for not having a hot trophy wife, though that's also a new low in modern political life. I mean the Trump-inspired Twitter pile on over Heidi Cruz's mental health. In the past, candidates' psychiatric histories have come under scrutiny--the paradigmatic case was Thomas Eagleton, who briefly served as George McGovern's running mate--but the mental health of spouses generally has not. No one, after all, benefits from a situation in which all politicians' relatives are subject to a reputational free-for-all. No one, that is, except Trump. This latest romp through the mud began, to be fair, with a scummy attack on Trump's wife, Melania. As you probably know by now, an anti-Trump super PAC put out an online ad, targeted to Mormons, attempting to shame Melania for posing nude for British GQ. Trump responded with a Twitter threat to ""spill the beans"" on Ted Cruz's wife. It's not clear whether Trump was actually talking about Heidi Cruz's history of depression, or whether he was just trolling for dirt. Whatever he intended, his tweet ensured that his rabid online followers would go after her. Heidi Cruz's depressive history was hardly a secret; BuzzFeed reported on it last year. On the night of Aug. 22, 2005, police found her sitting, head in hands, on the grass near an Austin, Texas, freeway. She wasn't intoxicated, but an officer on the scene concluded that she was a danger to herself, apparently because she was so close to traffic. ""About a decade ago, when Mrs. Cruz returned from D.C. to Texas and faced a significant professional transition, she experienced a brief bout of depression,"" an adviser to Ted Cruz told BuzzFeed's McKay Coppins and Megan Apper. ""Like millions of Americans, she came through that struggle with prayer, Christian counseling, and the love and support of her husband and family."" If you're a normal person, it's easy to sympathize with Heidi Cruz's misery, and not just because Ted Cruz is her husband. As BuzzFeed reported, she'd been a rising star in George W. Bush's White House before walking away from a job she loved so that Ted could pursue his career in Texas. She ended up at Goldman Sachs' Houston office, where she was the only woman. ""She ... quickly found that Houston's finance scene was considerably less accommodating to high-powered women than those of Washington or Manhattan,"" wrote Coppins and Apper. (Her culture shock recalls that of Hillary Clinton, who gave up her promising career in D.C. to follow her husband to Arkansas, where she felt marooned.) The Cruzes knew Heidi's brief breakdown was going to come out during the course of the campaign, but they had no reason to suspect that their opponents would make much of it. After all, anyone who smeared Cruz for his wife's mental illness would be subject to widespread opprobrium. Further, Cruz's greatest weakness is his repulsive personality. His apparent loyalty to his intelligent, complicated wife may be his lone redeeming quality; highlighting her struggles only humanizes him. But Trump doesn't think in terms of ordinary political strategy. His thuggery is blunter. He seeks to intimidate, hurt, and humiliate his opponents in any way he can, even if it costs him personally. Besides, the Voldemort-like power he derives from publicity, even bad publicity, immunizes him from public shame. This is awful for Heidi Cruz, whose marriage to Ted Cruz has already cost her quite a lot emotionally. It's also terrible for Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, and anyone Bill Clinton has slept with since leaving office. Before Trump, the conventional wisdom was that Bill Clinton has probably continued having affairs in his post-presidential years but that it wasn't in the interests of Hillary's enemies to publicize them. Doing so would leave them looking tawdry and create sympathy for Hillary, whose approval ratings hit a high point during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Trump doesn't appear to care about approval ratings. He seeks to destroy people who stand in his way, especially women, even if he looks disgusting doing it. Trump's attacks on Heidi Cruz are unlikely to hurt her husband politically, but they're surely painful personally. And when he rips into the Clintons' marriage, it probably won't help him win the election. But it will make Hillary suffer, and that, for Trump, might be its own reward.

There are at least some Americans saying the same thing. In a recent Fox News interview, Donald Trump warned that Tuesday's violence in Brussels was ""just the beginning"" and that ""at this point, we cannot allow these people to come into our country."" One complicating factor here is that it appears that the perpetrators of this attack, as well as the recent terror attack in Paris, are by and large not Muslim migrants. Rather, they are the children of Muslim migrants, born and raised in Europe. Defenders of large-scale Muslim migration will insist that barring new migrants would have absolutely no effect on the native-born women and men living in Europe's impoverished Muslim ghettos. But is that really true? How you feel about Muslim migration depends, to a large degree, on your moral instincts. Consider one of Trump's more cutting remarks in his Fox interview: ""That's the problem with the liberal policies of this country and this world, it's acting like it's our fault. It's not our fault, OK, it's not our fault. It's their fault."" Those who believe Europe ought to welcome Muslim migrants in large numbers might reply that it is our fault, at least in part. You could reasonably argue that the chaos spreading throughout the Arab world is a consequence of the Iraq invasion and the bloody conflicts that have followed or that the market democracies that have profited from capitalist exploitation are to blame for poverty and violence everywhere. It all depends on your particular ideological bent. Whether or not you believe that the miseries that have been visited upon people in Syria and elsewhere are our fault, realistically our willingness to do the ""right thing""--let's leave aside for now what ""the right thing"" is--depends on how easy it is to do the right thing. That is why advocates of mass refugee migration often downplay how difficult and expensive it is to integrate impoverished people from very different cultures into modern urban societies. If you tell people that accepting refugees will cost nothing because the Vietnamese boat people were quite successful in the 1970s and 1980s, you will have many takers. Tell them that today's refugees from Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere in the Muslim world will need a lot more help than those of earlier eras, in large part because the global economy has been really hard on people with limited skills, and the prospect sounds less appealing. What if you then added the possibility that the native-born children of these migrants would themselves have a desperately hard time in the decades to come and that some number of them would come to resent the countries that offered their parents refuge? The more realistic we are about these costs, the more people are likely to balk. Back in October, Daniel Byman, a leading expert on counterterrorism and a Slate contributor, wrote one of the smartest, sanest articles I've come across on the relationship between Muslim migration and Europe's terrorism problem. I should stress that Byman believes that European democracies ought to accept Muslim migrants in large numbers. But what I appreciate most about his article is that he offers a balanced account of what it will take to do so successfully. According to Byman, Europe's terrorism problem stems from the fact that large numbers of European Muslims feel a deep sense of anger and disaffection, which has created the conditions for radicalization. New refugees arriving in Europe are often grateful to have been offered sanctuary. But if European governments fail to provide them with the resources they need to flourish, there is a danger they will fall prey to radicals. ""If they cannot be integrated into local communities,"" Byman writes, ""then they risk perpetuating, or even exacerbating, the tensions between Muslim and non-Muslim communities in Europe."" Essentially, Byman is arguing that if Europeans accept large numbers of Muslim refugees, they'd better be prepared to provide Muslim communities with the services they need, from policing to language instruction to medical care, to ensure that these immigrants become full members of their host societies. If they don't make a full commitment to integrating these new residents and their native-born offspring, they'll be in for trouble. There's more to integrating refugees than just providing them with services, as Byman would acknowledge. Ordinary Europeans must welcome their new Muslim neighbors with open arms and not discriminate against them or otherwise make them feel ill at ease. If we can guarantee that your average white Belgian will treat your average brown Belgian with respect and affection and that Brussels will become a wonderland of interethnic harmony, all will (hopefully) be well. Byman is telling us that if European societies are warm and welcoming to traumatized Muslim migrants and provide them with various services, there is a good chance that these migrants will not grow dangerously resentful. Fair enough. But at some point you have to wonder: What's in it for the Europeans? Is there some positive case for welcoming large numbers of people who are at risk of becoming radicalized? Keep in mind that services like policing, education, and medical care are labor-intensive. That is, they require large numbers of skilled professionals to devote a great deal of time and effort to doing difficult jobs, and skilled professionals command far higher wages in affluent countries like Belgium than they do in poorer countries, like Syria or Iraq. Working migrants pay taxes, but many migrants find it difficult to work, particularly those who are not literate in the language of their host countries. Those who are literate often lack the skills and the social networks they need to find remunerative employment. This doesn't make them bad people, of course. It does mean that many migrants receive a great deal of expensive taxpayer-financed assistance while at the same time paying relatively little in taxes. Recently, Joakim Ruist, a research fellow at the University of Gothenburg, analyzed the fiscal cost of refugee migrants in Sweden. He carefully compared the revenues generated by refugee migrants in 2007, before the recent migrant crisis, and the fiscal costs of providing them with various services. That year, refugee migrants represented 5.1 percent of Sweden's population, accounted for 5.6 percent of total public spending, and contributed 3.4 percent of total public revenue. This is hardly surprising, given that refugee migrants earn such low incomes when they earn any income at all. Overall, Ruist finds that Sweden's nonrefugee population redistributed 1 percent of gross domestic product to its refugee population in 2007, four-fifths of which reflects lower revenue levels from refugees, and one-fifth of which reflects higher per capita costs for providing for refugees. Ruist estimates that the cost of Sweden's refugee population has now increased to 1.35 percent of GDP. Other analysts, like Tino Sanandaji of the Stockholm School of Economics, have suggested that the net cost is substantially higher than Ruist believes it be. But let's assume for now that Ruist is correct. He argues that this net cost is pretty modest, and that the economic burden of providing for refugees should not deter Europeans from welcoming more of them. There's another way of looking at this fiscal cost, however. As small as it sounds, 1.35 percent of GDP is a huge amount of money in an affluent country--approximately $8.1 billion in Sweden. That brings us back to the question of how large-scale migration affects local populations, including second-generation immigrants. That level of spending could finance a dramatic increase in overseas development assistance or services for the second-generation children of migrants, who often find themselves living in bleak, underfinanced housing estates and attending substandard schools. What if Belgium and other European democracies decided to do more to integrate their large second-generation Muslim populations before deciding to bring in large new refugee populations? Or to put it another way: What if these societies decided to deal with the problems they already have at home before inviting new people through the door? Earlier this month, Foreign Policy's Sumi Somaskanda reported that established immigrant communities in Germany--among them second- and third-generation Germans of Turkish, Arab, or African origin--are in many cases quite skeptical about the wisdom of admitting refugees in large numbers. The descendants of Turkish migrants who came to Germany to work menial jobs often find themselves on the bottom rungs of German society, and many of them see new arrivals as competition for a dwindling number of low-skill jobs, subsidized housing, and the other benefits that they depend on to lead dignified lives. These ethnic Germans understand that life on the margins of one of Europe's richest democracies can be brutal and that even the most progressive government can't make discrimination vanish. We'd all like for people to be open-minded, loving, and tolerant toward people who look and sound different from them. But if stamping out bigotry from every European heart is the only way to ensure that today's Muslim migrants don't give rise to alienated second-generation communities, we're in for a rude awakening. I do not believe that Europe's democracies, or for that matter the U.S., ought to shut down all Muslim migration. But if we don't want today's Muslim migrants to raise the next generation's native-born radicals, we ought to limit migration to those who are most likely to flourish in Western societies: people with the language skills, the education, and the experiences that will allow them to integrate successfully, even if these societies don't become discrimination-free utopias. This is not because migrants who don't have these qualities aren't good people. It is because Belgium and other Western democracies are not enlightened, generous, or otherwise perfect enough to behave in such a saintly manner.

8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/don_t_drop_out_bernie.html	"No Democrat would ever insist Bernie Sanders drop out of the race, Sen. Sherrod Brown told Politico this week. ""I don't think any Democrat should call on him to get out,"" he said. ""Almost no Democrat I know would say that. And shouldn't."" The Democrats won't force him out of the race, no; they'll just smother him with smarmy condescension. Sen. Claire McCaskill, for instance, tells Politico that ""what's important is not whether or not he gets out, but how he campaigns. If the contrast is now about what separates us from Donald Trump, then I think it's fine."" Did you hear that, Sanders? You have McCaskill's permission to continue campaigning as long as you only speak about how Democrats are better than Donald Trump. ""It's good [for Sanders] to continue to raise the concerns that people have,"" Sen. Jeanne Shaheen says, similarly, ""but I think it ought to be in the context of, 'This is the difference between the Democrats and Republicans in this race.' "" It's unclear where either McCaskill or Shaheen got the perception that Sanders is campaigning to be the rapid-response director of the Democratic National Committee. And it's also not as if Sanders has been especially vicious with Clinton this race. Sanders isn't going anywhere, and since he's still in the race, he's going to keep trying to win states. He won two of them Tuesday night. Though Hillary Clinton took the big catch--Arizona--Sanders was able to net the most delegates on the night. Clinton's 58 percent to 40 percent victory in Arizona netted her 15 delegates over Sanders, while Sanders' blowouts in Utah and Idaho netted him 31. Net the nets and Sanders trimmed into Clinton's delegate lead by 16. Sanders' good night, however, makes him only 5 percent less finished than he was before the night began--which was pretty finished. He still trails Clinton by 303 pledged delegates, per the Associated Press, and he's running out of states. His extremely narrow chance for besting Clinton in the final pledged count still rests on thumping her in large contests such as New York, Pennsylvania, and California. In the short term, he can continue making gains--and maintaining a pulse in the media narrative--with favorable upcoming contests in Alaska, Hawaii, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Sanders needs a medium- to large-sized miracle to overcome Clinton. But as long as he's not mathematically eliminated and his campaign still has money, there's no reason for Sanders to drop out--not this far into a process that no one figured he'd survive past Super Tuesday. Sanders has earned the right to finish out his candidacy, just as Clinton had in 2008. The question within the Democratic Party is more about how he should campaign for the remainder of the primary season. This is where the problems come in. Sanders and his supporters, of course, would like to continue campaigning aggressively in order to win or at least to keep the heat on Clinton. Clinton and her supporters, which include the vast majority of the Democratic Party apparatus, would like Sanders to back the hell off and not put her in any uncomfortable positions. Putting Clinton in uncomfortable positions is exactly what Sanders wants to do. His continued presence in the race performs the valuable service of cornering her into commitments she otherwise may not feel comfortable making. In other words: He pulls her to the left. This is simultaneously why Sanders won't stop competing against Clinton one second before he's required to and why the Democratic Party apparatus would like him to stop competing with her altogether. Consider what would have happened had Sanders dropped out before the last debate in Miami. There would have been no debate, duh. And if there hadn't been a debate, Clinton would never have been cornered into pledging not to deport any children or any adults without criminal records. That was an extremely important moment for progressive immigration reform activists and not a commitment she would have made in a vacuum. Two Democratic debates remain. These are the sorts of positions that begin to give Democratic leaders the willies. Sure, the entire party has moved leftward on immigration in recent years. Not every elected Democrat, though, will be pleased to defend his or her party standard-bearer's position that only criminal adults should be deported. And party operatives will worry that this position veers too far from the center. This is why the likes of McCaskill and Shaheen would like Sanders to spend the remainder of his time speaking exclusively about how Trump is a jerk rather than pressuring Clinton into making more commitments with which the center may be uncomfortable. They're asking Sanders to continue running for the nomination without really running for the nomination. It doesn't work that way. See more of Slate's Democratic primary coverage."

Tuesday night, Republicans and Democrats will vote and caucus in contests in Arizona and Utah. Democrats will also caucus in Idaho. The polling is sparse, but the numbers we have suggest that Donald Trump will win Arizona and Ted Cruz will win Utah. The exact breakdown in Utah will matter: If Cruz wins a majority, he'll get all of the state's delegates, but if he wins only a plurality, the delegates will be split proportionally, with many going to Trump. Cruz is currently polling at 50 percent. Hillary Clinton has a solid lead over Bernie Sanders in Arizona. The two Democratic candidates are neck and neck in Utah, and we know very little about Idaho. As Josh Voorhees observes, Sanders could win two out of these three contests and still receive fewer delegates tonight than Hillary. At this point, she's the presumptive nominee. (Sorry.)

It soon became clear that neither of us had spent much time watching the network. We were familiar with it, certainly--I'm a fan of Fox News Sunday, and I've caught a few episodes of Special Report while idly channel-surfing. As a close follower of conservative media, I also know a fair bit about its intrigues, and about the quirks of its various personalities. Yet it's rare that I'd ever sit down to actually watch the channel. Honestly, I'd rather put on Seinfeld reruns or the Fung Bros on YouTube than take a load off and settle in for some Sean Hannity. Is that weird, given that right-wingery is a pretty central part of my life? After all, Fox News is the supposed media mecca of movement conservatism. My lack of interest in Fox News makes sense, though, when you realize that it isn't a channel for Republicans. It's a network for old people. As of the end of last year, the primetime median age of Fox News viewers was 68. Mind you, I'm not particularly young. I'm deep into my 30s, and I'm profoundly unhip. My favorite thing to do is to hang out with my parents over heaping plates of steamed broccoli. Like many elderly Americans, I am suspicious of communism, and I often fret that the country is going to hell. While I wouldn't describe myself as a doomsday prepper, I don't find the idea of prepping for doomsday totally absurd. Why not stockpile MREs in the basement? Add it all up, and I'm about as likely to watch Fox News as anyone born since the Johnson administration. But I don't watch Fox News, because it's not really meant for me. It is meant for aging conservative baby boomers, which is why the network is so fixated on the particular concerns and tastes of aging conservative baby boomers. Night after night, you get nonstop coverage of left-wing protesters run amok and ISIS recruiting America's grandchildren, delivered by perky blondes and square-jawed anchormen. I bring this all up not to poke fun at Fox News, which employs a number of excellent, hardworking journalists. Rather, I'm struck by the parallels between the demographics of Fox News viewers and the demographics of Republican voters. The Grand Old Party circa 2016 is the Grand Old People Party. The advanced age of the Fox News audience tells you everything you need to know about the topics it covers, the look of its most prominent personalities, and its many advertisements for pharmaceutical solutions for older gentlemen who still like to get it on. Similarly, the advanced age of Republican voters explains the contours of the GOP agenda. Democrats have a substantial edge with voters under 35 while Republicans are more likely to be on the older side of middle age and septuagenarians. The beauty of the over-65 set is that they are reliable voters. The bad news about them is that they are not long for this Earth, and they are not always in tune with the fears, hopes, and dreams of voters who will be around for decades to come. How does the age profile of the Republican base shape the party? Back in 2012, I had the good fortune to attend the Republican National Convention in Tampa, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was hobnobbing with the exact same people that had cheered on Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984. One friend, a left-wing essayist, told me about a delegate he had met--a single mother who'd been in her late 20s at the tail end of Reagan's first term, and who capitalized on the economic recovery by going into the then-booming office-furniture business. Companies were starting to revamp their offices to install cubicles and computers, and she was there to sell them swivel chairs and desks. The Reagan years were the best years of her life. She was making money, she found love, lost it, and found it again. America was in full bloom. How could she not be nostalgic for those years? It's hardly surprising that she'd contrast the Obama years unfavorably with a time when she was healthy and happy, and when life seemed full of promise. So why wouldn't she want the party to keep preaching that old-time Reagan religion of supply-side tax cuts? Is it any surprise that even youngish Republicans like Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio sing the virtues of Saint Ronald, even though they were still in short pants when he first came into office? Or consider Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination. Trump is not a conventional conservative, but by promising to ""Make America Great Again,"" his campaign is making an emotional appeal to older Americans who very viscerally miss the good old days. To be sure, Trump appears to have done about as well with young GOP primary voters as he does with older ones--it's just that there aren't all that many young GOP primary voters. A new USA Today/Rock the Vote survey finds that among voters under 35, Hillary Clinton would defeat Trump by a margin of 52 percent to 19 percent. One doesn't want to be too hard on Trump: I can easily imagine other candidates who'd do worse among the youth, e.g. past-his-prime 1980s spokesdog Spuds MacKenzie. But if you're a human Republican hoping to woo the voters of the future, you'd have reason to be disappointed by this 19 percent figure. When mainstream conservatives fret about how Trump is wrecking the GOP, I nod along with them. I'm not a fan either. Among the less-than-ancient, however, the GOP brand has already been wrecked by the less-than-dizzyingly-successful Bush years, which saw a bloody quagmire in Iraq, the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina, and a catastrophic financial crisis that scarred the lives of tens of millions of young people, and from which roughly half of the country hasn't fully recovered. What have Republicans done in the Obama years? They've said precious little about youth unemployment and student loan debt while attacking Obamacare subsidies out of a fear that they might threaten Medicare benefits for retirees. Trump is promising to bring back manufacturing jobs from China and Mexico which have mostly been lost to machines while saying virtually nothing about where the jobs of the future will come from. If Donald Trump is the Republican nominee and Hillary Clinton wins the general election in a landslide, as seems increasingly likely, Democrats will be in a triumphal mood, at least for a while. But I believe that a new, younger conservative party will emerge in the aftermath of 2016. There are tensions within a bigger, more diverse Democratic Party--between urban socialists and centrist suburbanites, for instance, and between middle-class black Americans and working-class Hispanics--that will inevitably grow more pronounced. A new opposition party will arise, and chances are that it will be to the right of the party of Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren. And though members of this party will probably call themselves Republicans, we can safely say that it won't look like your grandfather's GOP, because your grandfather will be dead.

That, of course, isn't how they've framed the effort. ""A secretive group of Republican operatives and conservative leaders convened Thursday morning for more than three hours to discuss ways to unite the right against Donald Trump,"" reports Robert Costa for the Washington Post, ""with a presentation about the feasibility of mounting a third-party challenge as well as extensive deliberations about whether a coalition of anti-Trump forces could prevent the billionaire mogul from securing the party's presidential nomination at the convention in Cleveland."" Costa describes a conversation focused on boosting Sen. Ted Cruz, the most viable anti-Trump Republican left in the primary, and brainstorming candidates for a late-entry contender to the presidential race. But this is just a long way of saying that conservatives--or at least, an elite group of them--are preparing to sacrifice the election to save their movement. That's because the practical consequences of forming a ""true conservative"" third party would be to split the GOP vote and preclude either Trump or a conservative alternative from winning 270 Electoral College votes. They would be handing the White House to Hillary Clinton. For the right, it's hard to overstate the damage that comes with losing the White House for another four years. Not only would President Clinton preserve (and possibly strengthen) the Obama legacy, but she'd also entrench liberal policymaking in the executive branch and further reshape the federal judiciary with four years of nominations. Likewise, she stands a strong chance of replacing several justices on the Supreme Court, potentially transforming American jurisprudence and putting conservatives on the defensive for the long term. And when a Republican presidency eventually comes, whether in 2020 or 2024, conservatives will have fewer people with executive-branch experience--a real bottleneck for first-term presidents. Conservatives might deal themselves a generational setback by forfeiting the election to stop Trump. But that doesn't mean it's not worth the sacrifice. First, a step back. Presidential elections aren't just close because of a polarized electorate; they're also close because both sides are almost evenly matched. Both parties raise massive sums of money and build campaigns of comparable size and complexity; they field candidates of similar skill and competence, and they saturate airwaves in almost equal measure. As such, presidential elections turn less on campaigns or candidates than they do on ""fundamental"" factors such as economic growth, presidential approval, war, and scandal. But when one side is demonstrably weaker than the other, the board shifts. In that environment, big wins are suddenly possible. And that's what we're looking at with Trump. Yes, Trump is winning the Republican primary. But outside his constituency, millions of people--including many Republicans--dislike and even despise him. There's an obvious rejoinder here: What about Hillary Clinton? And it's true that Clinton is unpopular; her 12.5 percent net unfavorable puts her among the most unpopular presidential candidates of the past 25 years. But Trump is less popular by an enormous margin, with a net unfavorable of 28.5 percent, the highest recorded in recent memory. At minimum Trump will enter a general election with a party that isn't united behind him. This would be catastrophic in an environment where winning requires a full-court press. A nominee without complete party support is a nominee who can't rely on a full bench of surrogates, can't utilize party organizations in key states and counties, can't tap into critical fundraising networks, and can't fully defend himself from attacks. Trump will face fierce blows from the Democratic Party, and as he withers under the strain, millions of Republicans will watch without pity. If he dies, they'll say, he dies. A third-party conservative candidate makes matters even worse. Presidential elections are winner-takes-all--if conservatives split the Republican Party vote, then Hillary Clinton doesn't need a majority to win states such as North Carolina, or even Indiana, Georgia, Arizona, and Missouri--states where the 2012 margin between Republicans and Democrats was at or fewer than 10 points. On Nov. 9, the electoral map might be a deep shade of blue. But there's a difference between the two scenarios. Under the first, demoralized, anti-Trump Republicans stay home. They don't vote for president, and they also don't vote for down-ballot races. Not only do Republicans lose the presidency, but they also lose the Senate, and--if Trump falls below 45 percent of the two-party vote--they put their hold on the House of Representatives at risk, too. A conservative third party doesn't eliminate that risk--some Republicans might still stay home--but it reduces it. It becomes a rallying point for anti-Trump conservatives, who can register a presidential vote against the real estate mogul without backing Clinton, and they can support Senate, House, and other down-ballot candidates. Where the alternative is tying party fortunes to Trump and watching them crash on the rocks of his candidacy, splitting the Republican presidential vote might be the only way to save a Republican majority in Congress and save conservatism as a movement. The only flaw in this plan is it doesn't account for the Democratic Party. Against Trump, Democrats will be unified. They'll have a sitting president and a former one on the trail, stumping for their nominee, in addition to a whole suite of high-profile Democrats, including Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker. They'll have anti-Trump enthusiasm and a billion-dollar (or more) campaign, designed to tie Trump to the Republican Party and vice versa. Congressional candidates will try to escape their nominee, but Democrats will work hard to keep them in place, lashed to the racist demagogue that captured the party nomination. ""Donald Trump is a very unconventional candidate, to be sure,"" said chief Clinton strategist Joel Benenson in an interview with Greg Sargent of the Washington Post. ""But when you come down to the big issues that we're debating, every one of these Republicans is aligned with the most extreme policies of the Republican Party economically."" As much as conservative Republicans want to believe they can separate themselves from Trump, they can't.  They're trapped with him, and right now, there's no way out.

12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/why_ted_cruz_could_win_the_gop_nomination_in_2020.html	"Donald Trump is halfway to the Republican presidential nomination. Sen. Ted Cruz is the only rival who can catch him. Many Republicans think either candidate would be a disastrous nominee, but they aren't sure which is worse. Trump is volatile and incendiary. Cruz is dogmatic and abrasive. Choosing between them, in the words of Sen. Lindsey Graham, is like choosing between ""being shot or poisoned."" The good news, these Republicans figure, is that neither injury would be fatal. With Trump or Cruz at the top of the ticket, 2016 will be a bad year. But the loss will sober Republican voters. They'll learn that rejecting the establishment candidate, and nominating an angry outsider or a zealot instead, just surrenders more votes and more power to the Democrats. The GOP's fever will break, and in 2020 Republicans will choose a more mainstream candidate. It's a comforting story, and it sounds plausible no matter which man, Trump or Cruz, is the nominee. But what if it's both? What if Trump wins the nomination this year, and Cruz wins it in 2020? As things stand, that's exactly what's likely to happen. First the GOP will be poisoned. Then it will be shot. In the past 30 years, Republicans have held six presidential nomination fights that were truly open--that is, primaries that didn't include a sitting president. Five of those six races were won by the candidate who came in second in the previous open contest. Ronald Reagan lost the 1976 nomination to Gerald Ford and returned as the nominee in 1980. George H.W. Bush, who lost in 1980 to Reagan, became Reagan's vice president and won the next open nomination fight in 1988. Bob Dole lost the 1988 battle to Bush and won the next open race in 1996. John McCain lost to George W. Bush in 2000 and won the next open contest in 2008. Mitt Romney lost to McCain in 2008 and became the nominee in 2012. The only exception during this stretch was Pat Buchanan, who came in second in 1996 and switched to the Reform Party in 1999. This year will be another exception: former Sen. Rick Santorum, who came in second in 2012, fizzled this time and won't be the nominee. But neither of those candidates performed nearly as well as Cruz has this year. In 1996, according to the Associated Press, Buchanan won only 145 delegates. In 2012, Santorum won 245 delegates. Cruz already has about 400 delegates, and we're only halfway through. Cruz has an impressive money machine. By the end of January, he had raised $54 million, about $20 million more than Trump, Jeb Bush, or Sen. Marco Rubio. Pro-Cruz super PACs had raised another $50 million. Last month, Cruz reported an additional $12 million. That gives him about three times as much money as Buchanan and Santorum raised in their entire campaigns. And Cruz has built a far more extensive network than they did, with well-organized field operations in every state. He has a powerful constituency on the religious right and a second base in the Tea Party. He would start 2020 with the same advantages, if not more. The argument against Cruz is that he's obnoxious. His colleagues don't like him, and exit polls show he doesn't do nearly as well among moderate and somewhat conservative voters as he does among hardcore conservatives. Rubio strikes most people as the more attractive candidate. That's why, when my colleague Jamelle Bouie was betting on Cruz, I put my money on Rubio. Four months later, I stand refuted. Cruz hasn't overcome the Trump wave, but he has proved that in an angry party, his organization, discipline, and message can beat a broadly appealing rival. Republicans who vote for Trump in 2016, only to see him abandoned by elements of their party and defeated in the general election, would be at least as angry in 2020. The notion that his loss would teach them not to support Cruz has two glaring flaws. One flaw is that the desertion of Trump by the GOP establishment, or at least part of it, would confound the equation. A Trump rout wouldn't prove that Republicans are better off nominating a candidate like George W. Bush, because the right would be able to point to a difference between 2000 and 2016: the establishment's betrayal of Trump. The other problem is that Cruz isn't Trump. Trump's conservatism is visceral and stylistic. He's more interested in waterboarding, cracking down on China and Mexico, and beating the hell out of ISIS and protesters than he is in free-market orthodoxy. Cruz's conservatism is ideological. He cares about tax cuts, deregulation, and social-issue litmus tests. Many of Cruz's supporters see Trump as a left-leaning apostate. If Trump loses the general election, they won't conclude that their brand of conservatism has been refuted. They'll conclude, with some justice, that their brand of conservatism hasn't been tried. Cruz has been making this argument for months. In speeches, debates, interviews, and ads, he has painted Trump as a donor to liberals, a socialist on health care, and a squish on Planned Parenthood. Presumably, Cruz will hammer these differences all the way to the convention. And then, if Trump loses the election, Cruz will take up where he left off. He'll raise more money, build out his field organization, and lock up support in the Tea Party and on the religious right. He'll tell hardline Republican audiences what they want to hear: that Trump lost because he wasn't a ""consistent conservative."" That's a tired excuse for every Republican defeat. But it's an accurate description of Trump. In that scenario, four years from now, the GOP will be facing President Hillary Clinton. Democrats will be trying to win their fourth consecutive presidential election, a feat no party has accomplished since 1948. Voters will be restless. There could be a recession, an unpopular war, or a catastrophic terror attack. The last time a party held the White House for 12 years, the opposition party--the Democrats--wised up. They nominated an attractive centrist: Bill Clinton. Unlike Walter Mondale, Clinton wasn't steeped in liberal orthodoxy. Unlike Michael Dukakis, he understood conservative cultural anxieties. And unlike Trump and Cruz, he was more interested in collaboration than in conflict. All of these differences contributed to his election and his presidency. Eventually, Republicans will learn the same lesson. But they haven't learned it yet, and it's not clear that they'll get the message even if Trump leads them to a landslide defeat. Losing a fourth straight election to the Democrats, and a fourth to the Clintons in three decades, would be difficult. But Cruz, with his sanctimony and his hard-right agenda, might be up to the job. That would be a cruel fate for Lindsey Graham. On Thursday, Graham endorsed Cruz, calling Trump ""a disaster for our party."" It gets worse, Lindsey. There are two disasters, and you can have both.

13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/don_t_confuse_donald_trump_s_slim_margins_with_a_sign_of_weakness.html	"A bit of conventional wisdom was settling in on Wednesday morning that though Donald Trump enjoyed a good ""Super Tuesday II,"" with victories in the Northern Mariana Islands, Florida, North Carolina, Illinois, and--tentatively--Missouri, he may not have done well enough to ward off a contested convention. John Kasich's win in his home state, Ohio, deprived Trump of a juicy 66 delegates, and he has still not shown that he can claim a state with anything greater than a plurality of the popular vote. By the Associated Press' latest estimate, he'll need to win 54 percent of the remaining delegates to secure the nomination by the end of primary season on June 7. As the AP notes, Trump has won ""only"" 47 percent of the delegates allocated so far. ""That's not good enough,"" the story continues, since ""it takes a majority of delegates to win the nomination, according to party rules."" This doubtful forecast--that Trump's state performances will have to improve--was also posited by NBC News' Chuck Todd on Tuesday night: This line of thinking seems to conflate a majority of votes in any given state with a majority of that state's delegates--something that might make more sense in the early stage of the primary and its many proportionally allocated delegate contests. With a few exceptions, those contests are over. Though there aren't too many ""pure"" winner-take-all contests like Ohio and Florida remaining--those are the primaries in which the state's popular vote winner takes all of the state's delegates--there are still some, including Arizona, Delaware, Nebraska, Montana, New Jersey, and South Dakota. And there are plenty of ""hybrid"" winner-take-all states that award some delegates to the overall state winner and others to the congressional-district winners. In these states, a candidate can rack up most of a state's delegates with thin but consistent pluralities, especially if he or she can draw support from a broad geographical base. Significant states like Wisconsin, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and California--each with its own set of quirks--award on a hybrid basis. There are 380 delegates in all to be had in those five primaries. Consider the results of two of these hybrid contests held Tuesday: Illinois and Missouri. Cruz hoped to be competitive in these two states, and he was--but not competitive enough. That makes all the difference. Trump won Illinois with a 39 percent plurality to Cruz's 30, but Trump is going to come away with considerably more than 39 percent of the state's 69 delegates. (Although since Illinois selects its congressional-district winners by direct election of delegates, there's room in the final count for some, let us say, twists.) But as of Wednesday afternoon, Trump had won 51 of Illinois' delegates to Cruz's nine and Kasich's five. That's already 74 percent of the state's delegation in Trump's favor--again, with only a 39 percent statewide popular vote plurality. The results in Missouri haven't been officially called yet given Trump's slight lead statewide, which right now rests at a mere 1,726 votes. Trump has a 40.9 percent popular vote plurality to Cruz's 40.7 percent. If that result holds, Trump will get the state's 12 statewide-winner delegates and then five per congressional-district win--and he will win most congressional districts. He has already been awarded five districts to Cruz's one, with two outstanding. That amounts, already, to 37 delegates--or 71 percent of the total delegation. With a 41 percent statewide popular vote plurality. What makes Trump so strong in these hybrid contests is the strength of his pluralities across the map. In Illinois, he built up wide pluralities in Chicago and its suburbs, while also performing well in more rural counties in the eastern, western, and southern parts of the state. Cruz had him beat only in the central parts of the state surrounding Springfield and Peoria. Missouri's map was similar. Cruz took the areas surrounding Kansas City, Columbia, and (Missouri's) Springfield. But Trump crushed in rural counties and also took pluralities in St. Louis City, which has a negligible number of Republican votes, and its surrounding counties, which have many Republican votes. If you're winning pluralities in both large rural expanses and urban areas, you're going to win a lot of congressional districts' winner-take-all delegates, even if the margins are slim. Kasich's Ohio win, in the long run, may turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to Trump. It keeps Kasich in the race and prevents the anti-Trump vote from coalescing around Cruz, the only candidate with the slightest chance of catching up to Trump. In red states, this makes it easier for Trump to win his pluralities in over Ted Cruz; in blue states, he'll be able to do the same over Kasich. Trump is in decent shape to reach 1,237 before the convention as long as the field remains split and he can keep taking his statewide and congressional-level pluralities. We know, we know, it would be fun to start daydreaming about a contested convention right now. But the race is still in Trump's tiny hands."

14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/what_hillary_clinton_learned_from_losing_to_obama.html	"After last week's primaries, the story was Bernie Sanders' massive upset in Michigan. Facing a Hillary Clinton victory in a state where he badly needed his message to resonate, he overcame a 20-point deficit in the polls to upend the narrative of the Democratic race. Suddenly, Clinton looked fragile against Sanders' ability to bring thousands and thousands of young voters and independents to the polls. But missing from most coverage was a simple fact: Yes, Clinton lost Michigan, but she grew her delegate lead that day with a huge win in Mississippi. We are primed to see national elections as a race for states--if you win the most, you win the election. That's generally true of the race for president, where electoral votes are winner-take-all, and winning the most states translates to winning the contest. But the presidential nomination is different. It's a race for delegates under a complex (and often inconsistent) set of rules. And it rewards candidates who can understand and game the playbook to their advantage. We saw that in the 2008 Democratic primary--not with Clinton but with Barack Obama, who lost large states like Florida, California, and Texas, and either tied or lost the national popular vote (depending on how you count the Michigan primary). But the Obama campaign was less interested in winning states than in maximizing delegates in every contest. Where he had an advantage, Team Obama worked for landslides; where he was losing, Team Obama tried to fight to a draw or modest defeat. The result, after two months of voting, was a structural advantage. Unless Clinton won the lion's share of delegates going forward (or his campaign imploded under some hypothetical crisis), Obama couldn't lose. Which brings us back to 2016. Bernie Sanders has a strong campaign. He's dominated contests like New Hampshire and kept margins close in states like Massachusetts and Nevada. But Hillary Clinton, having learned lessons from her last campaign, is running a race for delegates. And like Obama before her, she's run up the score in favorable states and held tight in contested ones. Up until Tuesday's primaries, this gave her an advantage. And now, with lopsided victories in Florida and North Carolina, she enjoys a structural lead that dwarfs the one Obama held at this point in 2008. Clinton is ahead by more than 300 delegates, which is to say that even if she had lost to Sanders on Tuesday in Ohio, Illinois, and Missouri, her large delegate lead would've been safe. As it stands, Clinton didn't win only in the South, once considered her sole stronghold in the primary; she captured the Midwest, too, finishing the night with Ohio and Illinois in her corner. (At press time, Missouri was still counting.) With these wins, her delegate lead leaves Sanders in a tight spot even after you bracket ""superdelegates"" from the equation. Post Tuesday, there are just six states that award more than 100 delegates: California, Maryland, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Washington. To win a pledged-delegate lead, Sanders would have to score upset after upset after upset, by unprecedented margins. And that's with similarly large wins in smaller states. None of this is an impossibility, but I wouldn't bet on any of it.* Clinton still has a long slog to the nomination--it takes time to accumulate the delegates she needs--but it's a clear one, without major obstacles. In a sense, she and her team have reverse-engineered Obama's 2008 effort, bringing ""establishment"" resources--huge fundraising and tremendous party support--to bear on an insurgent-style campaign that focused on voter contacts and organizing instead of paid media and massive events. Clinton has made mistakes, and she will continue to make them, but her present campaign is durable enough to survive them. *This sentence has been updated for clarity.

15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/for_bernie_and_trump_the_media_is_just_another_elite_institution_that_s.html	"LOS ANGELES--Rosario Dawson, the actress, was introducing Bernie Sanders to a packed crowd of supporters at Los Angeles' Wiltern Theatre last week when her speech rounded into familiar themes, and suddenly she began to sound like AM radio. ""I think we see what's going on in the corporate media of late,"" Dawson said, drawing sustained and instant boos at the words corporate and media. ""The media has given Trump""--more boos--""almost $1.9 billion worth of free media."" More boos still. ""They've given Bernie Sanders 16 percent of that."" A lot more boos. ""And mostly to say that he should just give up""--lots of boos--""how the entire country shouldn't even bother voting."" Additional boos. ""Considering what people had to do in this country for our right to vote, I find that reprehensible."" Wild applause. Everyone loves to boo the media. There's nothing new about that. But Dawson's line of attack wasn't the usual vague discontent with the trivializing tendencies of the political press. Her criticism, echoing not only the candidate for whom she's stumping but even the bellowing front-runner for the Republican nomination whom she opposes, was more pointed. ""The corporate media is afraid of losing their jobs,"" she went on to say. ""They are being told--believe me ... anyone who's a part of that culture understands, there's an unspoken little hashtag going around that's saying, 'Loyalty will be rewarded.' "" Saying that mainstream journalists are venal and corrupt in this way isn't all that different from Trump calling them ""lying, disgusting people"" or ""bloodsuckers."" The Sanders camp generalizes in these sorts of anti-media statements, preferring to point at systemic failures; Trump, meanwhile, personalizes. But both candidates are working from a similar premise here: that the media is another crooked elite institution whose authority has crumbled. Their supporters love this stuff. In the case of Sanders and his backers, the substance of their critique is based on a number of misperceptions, chief among them that journalists are out to get the Vermont senator because they want Hillary Clinton to be president and maintain a corporatist status quo. This is a fundamental misreading of the news media for a number of reasons. First, the rise of Sanders has been good for campaign journalists, who prefer close political races and have even been prone to hyping such races where they do not exist because excitement is good copy and good business. Second, the political press has no particular love for Clinton--you can see this in the negative coverage of her campaign for large swaths of 2015 (which may have even contributed to Sanders' rise), not to mention the general schadenfreude floating in the wake of her failure during the 2008 election. Finally, this worldview imputes motives to the media that just aren't there. Yes, individual journalists tilt toward specific candidates and ideologies just like everyone else, but the overriding biases are toward either a good story or not sounding dumb. If the Sandernistas have a point, it's related to that latter bias. There is indeed a cult of savviness, as press critic Jay Rosen terms it. Among other things it prevented many in the media from taking either Trump's or Sanders' candidacies seriously at first, lest they be seen as naifs not in on the joke. You could see the cult at work, too, in some of the tut-tutting over the supposed callowness of the Sanders platform, as if Clinton's proposal for criminal justice reform, say, was anything but an aspirational document. But the wish to appear politically hard-edged and shrewd has little to do with a corporate ideology. It's a matter of self-preservation. The misunderstanding by Bernie backers--that journalists are stooges opposed to his candidacy because they are beholden to corporate overlords and that supporting Sanders is a good way to throw mud in their eyes--is fostered by the candidate himself, to his great benefit. ""What you have is a corporate media which by definition has conflicts of interest,"" Sanders told the Young Turks host Cenk Uygur last week, citing a list of corporate control of major television networks. ""The media is an arm of the ruling class of this country. And they want to talk about everything in the world except the most important issues."" When I asked Sanders communications director Michael Briggs for specific examples of nefarious corporate influence, he mentioned Ed Schultz's show being pulled from Comcast-owned MSNBC last summer, which he attributed to Schultz's criticism of free trade. ""I'm not being a conspiracy theorist here. I'm not saying that there's some memo that came down from network brass to tell the reporters to cover this, don't cover that,"" Briggs told me. ""But reporters want to get on the air. They realize what gets on the air. And what gets on the air is not a discussion of the serious issues facing our country. What gets on the air is the horse-race, soap-opera kind of view of politics in this country."" This critique of the media is in keeping with Sanders' wider anti-elitist campaign themes. But as Trump has also found, there are political benefits to attacking the press that you don't get from attacking other establishment bogeyman such as Wall Street millionaires and billionaires or ""stupid"" politicians. Namely that when things go bad for either Trump or Sanders, there is a readymade alibi that will bind supporters closer to the candidate and explain away any actual problems the campaign might have. At the Los Angeles event, Sanders field organizer Juan Ayon told the crowd: ""The truth is that this campaign is on the path to victory. Don't worry about what the corporate media tells you. They want you to lose hope. They want you to lose faith. But trust me we will win."" The previous speaker, pastor and Carson City Councilman Jawane Hilton, had suggested that the media was ignoring Sanders' March 22 victories in Idaho and Utah in an effort to ""sweep that under the rug."" Sanders himself got in on the act. Before praising Rosario Dawson's ""very important points"" about the media, he opened his speech by echoing her idea that the media was spreading lies about his campaign. ""Let me get right to the point and pick up where Rosario left off,"" he said. ""There's some mythology going on out there that we cannot win this election--that is mythology."" This is mythology. The media has treated Sanders' campaign as a long-shot candidacy throughout, because that's what it has been throughout. That it is still one was even acknowledged by the candidate himself in an interview with the Los Angeles Times editorial board just the previous day. ""I would fully concede that we have a narrow path to victory,"" he told the Times. That negative assessment of Bernie Sanders' chances by corporate media shill Bernie Sanders is backed up by math. Even after Sanders' dominating performance in this past Saturday's caucuses, his delegate deficit is enormous. What he needs to do to achieve victory is nearly impossible considering the remaining electoral map. Again, this is not because the evil media is out to get him, but rather because of fundamental issues Sanders has had winning core segments of the Democratic primary electorate. ""Secretary Clinton did very well in the South. We're out of the South. We're in the West now,"" Sanders boasted to his Los Angeles supporters to loud cheers. That description made it sound as if geography itself were biased against Sanders. The real reason is that older minority voters made up a large portion of the electorate in those Southern states, and they swept Clinton to victory there. Sanders has done exceptionally well in smaller caucus states with fewer minority voters. (His Saturday victory in Hawaii, a small caucus state with minority voters who are not as represented in the rest of the Democratic electorate, is an exception, as was his surprise win in the Michigan primary with its fairly diverse electorate.) But many of the remaining contests he needs to win are bigger primary states with large populations of black and Hispanic voters. Even in liberal California, where Sanders is banking a considerable portion of his hopes for an overall victory, he trails Clinton by a considerable margin thanks to these voters. The last two major California polls had Clinton leading by 7 points and 10 points respectively, attributing a good amount of that margin to heavy support from black and Hispanic voters. When confronted with these facts, Sanders supporters tend to return to the media issue. At the Sanders rally, I asked 25-year-old writer Jenna Steckel about his long odds, and she immediately cited ""media bias."" While this idea is being stoked by the candidate, among his supporters it comes from a place much deeper than pure disbelief that Sanders might lose an election. ""My generation grew up during the war on terror and skyrocketing unemployment rates,"" Steckel said. ""We've seen a lot of things, and the collapse of our trust is pretty shaky in a lot of institutions."" Other young Sanders supporters I spoke with echoed this sentiment. David Green, a black 33-year-old musician who voted for Obama twice and sees racism as one reason for the level of Republican obstruction during his presidency, cited MSNBC as being particularly ""out of touch"" in its coverage of Sanders. ""Them saying he should cash in early is just an emphasis on how bad the news media is approaching this,"" Green said. Last year, a Harvard survey of 18- to 29-year-olds showed trust in the media among young people had reached an all-time low of 11 percent. This erosion of faith in the media tracked with the population at large, which explains why Sanders' themes of a corrupt ""corporate media"" are similar in ways to Trump's populist tirades against reporters. When asked about the difference between Trump's posture toward the media and Sanders', Briggs, the communications director for Sanders, said that Trump was a ""master media manipulator,"" whereas ""I think the way that we talk about the media is in a helpful critique that they'll pay more attention to important issues."" But both sides are playing the same card to similar effect. In fact, at the Los Angeles rally, Dawson seemed to praise Trump implicitly for taking advantage of anti-elitist, anti-media sentiment. ""The media and the establishment are afraid of Trump because he has a groundswell--despite the media bias--of people who are behind him because he is not establishment,"" she said. ""And he is pointing at the establishment and the corporate media and saying, 'You're fired.' "" At this, there were loud cheers and laughter. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump Have One Thing in Common: They Hate the Media
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/donald_trump_s_polling_collapse_in_wisconsin.html	"The April 5 Republican primary in Wisconsin is looking less like a toss-up between Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz and more like a probable win for Cruz. This would be a fairly grave problem for Trump in his effort to reach 1,237 delegates ahead of the convention. Further, a new Wisconsin poll from a well-respected outfit shows horrific favorability ratings for Trump in the state among all voters, mirroring his recent national downturn. If he can't reach enough delegates ahead of the convention, and his support shows signs of erosion in the final contests--all while his overall favorability rating dives from pretty terrible to comically toxic--it's going to be that much harder for him to convince delegates to stick with him in Cleveland. The just-released Marquette Law School poll for March finds Cruz at 40 percent in the state, with Trump at 30 percent and John Kasich at 21 percent. Trump's 30 percent is actually stable from the February version of the poll ... when there were three more candidates still in the race. Cruz's support, meanwhile, has shot up 21 points in a month, while Kasich's has increased 13. The once dearly held theory of the Trump ceiling--that his support would never exceed one-third of the primary electorate and thus would not grow even once the field had consolidated--has been shattered in some states. If this poll holds, though, the theory appears to apply to Wisconsin. One reason that Trump may be struggling in Wisconsin is that likely voters in Wisconsin despise him. The new Marquette poll finds his favorability rating at 22 percent, compared with a 70 percent unfavorability rating. That is ... bad? No. It would be an insult to the quiet dignity of the word ""bad"" to call that spread bad. A 22-70 favorability spread is in the mid- to high ""holy shits."" Sure, that number includes all voters, not just Republicans. But if Trump has a 22 percent overall favorability and 30 percent of the Republican vote, that means there aren't a whole lot of Republican primary voters out there for him to sway. The Marquette results are the latest to show the state slipping away from Trump as the contest approaches. And it's not a write-off state for him, either, in the way that perhaps Utah was. Trump's leads in the scattered Wisconsin polls conducted earlier this year factor critically into rough estimates of how he would reach a 1,237-delegate majority heading into the convention. A FiveThirtyEight delegate projection for Trump last week, compiled as an average of each staffer's projections, showed him accumulating 1,208 before the convention--i.e., just short of the mark. And even there, staffers projected that Trump had to earn 25 delegates out of Wisconsin's 42. Another comprehensive projection from the University of Virginia's Center for Politics this past week put Trump's final number just over the top at 1,239. In that projection, Trump earned 30 out of 42 delegates in Wisconsin. If results like those in the Marquette poll hold, Trump would pick up delegates in the single digits, at best. Wisconsin effectively offers 18 delegates to the statewide winner and another three for each of its eight congressional districts. The reason Trump was able to win the vast majority of delegates in states like Missouri and Illinois, even with modest plurality support, was the breadth of his support: He led in both rural areas and voter-rich concentrations around cities, a consistency that ensured pluralities in a lot of congressional districts. In Wisconsin, Cruz would flip the script. Trump is despised in the populous and very conservative Republican counties surrounding Milwaukee, an area from which several congressional districts draw their votes. The new Marquette poll finds Cruz with 53 percent support in Milwaukee City and County to Kasich's 22 and Trump's 15. Cruz leads Trump 43-27 in the rest of the Milwaukee media market. In the Madison market further west, meanwhile, Trump's main opponent is Kasich--and Kasich leads Trump 37-33.* The only area where Trump leads is in the northwestern part of the state. That's a lot of geographical area, but basically only one congressional district--or three total delegates, out of 42, that he'd have a strong chance of banking. If Cruz can take most or all of Wisconsin's delegates, Trump will have to pull off a surprise win or two of his own--or an absolutely dominant performance in the June 7 California primary--to make up for it. Otherwise, let's just say it's a good idea that he's finally seriously developing a convention delegate strategy. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 Republican primary.

17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/the_gop_loyalty_only_helped_donald_trump.html	"In September, the Republican National Committee bound itself to Donald Trump in a transparently desperate effort to keep the real estate mogul from bolting the GOP to make an independent run for president. ""I [name] affirm that if I do not win the 2016 Republican nomination for president of the United States I will endorse the 2016 Republican presidential nominee regardless of who it is,"" read the RNC's loyalty pledge, circulated to all the candidates in the race. ""I further pledge that I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate nor will I seek or accept the nomination for president of any other party."" Donald Trump never left the party. Instead, he bent it to his will, spurning the Republican establishment to score a long string of victories on the strength of his nativism, bigotry, and naked authoritarianism. Today, he is the front-runner in the Republican presidential primary, the guy with the most delegates, the most votes, and the clearest shot at the nomination. And on Tuesday, facing his two remaining rivals, he broke the pledge that was supposed to keep him from damaging the GOP. ""I don't anymore,"" said Trump at a CNN town hall when moderator Anderson Cooper asked him if he stood by the pledge. ""I have been treated very unfairly,"" he explained. This, thus far, is the least surprising thing to have happened in the Republican primary. RNC chairman Reince Priebus conceived the pledge as a way to protect Republicans from a potentially wild and untamable Trump. But in practice, it tied the party to Trump's fortunes, not theirs. And with Trump on the verge of victory, it's clear that this pledge was an important assist on his path to dominance. Before Trump signed the pledge, he had two major problems. First, as a recent convert to the Republican Party, he lacked a measure of legitimacy, which his rivals exploited for attacks. And second, the leverage of a third-party run was undercut by the problem of ballot access in the primary itself. As long as Trump refused to stand with the GOP, state party organizations had every right to keep his name off of their ballots. By signing the pledge, Trump made himself official with little cost to himself. That is the crucial point. The RNC pledge wasn't legally binding and didn't require anything of the real estate mogul. He even retained a small amount of leverage. ""I just wanted fairness from the Republican Party,"" Trump said at the time. ""I will be totally pledging my allegiance to the Republican Party and the conservative principles for which it stands."" Unspoken, but understood, was this: If fairness didn't come, the deal wouldn't hold. This changed the dynamic of the primary. On paper, at least, Trump was a Republican. Rivals couldn't fully disavow him; they'd signed the pledge, too, committing their support to Trump if he won the nomination. Which meant that at every turn, traditional candidates such as Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush were affirming Trump's qualifications for the presidency, even as they blasted his positions, his temperament, and his profound ignorance of public affairs. The pledge, in other words, gave Trump legitimacy. Today, Trump holds almost 50 percent support among Republicans nationwide. For millions of GOP voters, he is the most legitimate person in the party. Given that support, Trump doesn't need the pledge anymore--it has served its purpose. As such, he has discarded it in a mocking rebuke to a party establishment that thought it could corral Trump and now wants to maneuver around him. But just as the pledge failed, those maneuvers won't work either. Republican elites have no way out. If Trump stands for election in the fall, the party will lose. His popularity within the GOP obscures the extent to which he is the least popular figure in American politics, with negative ratings that exceed any ever recorded. Trump is so unpopular that Democratic strategists are beginning to plan for doing the once unthinkable--winning a majority in the House of Representatives. If Republican elites try to knock Trump off of the ticket through arcane convention rules and procedures, they will alienate his supporters, who form a large plurality of the party. Whether they stay home or join Trump in a write-in bid for the presidency--it's almost too late to make an independent run--the Republican Party loses. To be fair to Republican leaders, the pledge isn't the reason Trump is close to winning the party nomination. It merely helped. But Priebus and his allies had a choice. They didn't have to try to accommodate Trump and his movement. They could have disavowed him and his rhetoric, even if it risked a third-party candidacy. They could have said, ""Never Trump"" when a stiff repudiation from the usual gatekeepers might have stopped him cold. Instead, they have to watch a strongman unleash the ugliness and hate that has simmered under the surface of the party for years. As for what that looks like? Hours before Trump broke the RNC pledge, he held a rally in Janesville, Wisconsin, home to Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. There, supporters attacked a 15-year-old protester. One man allegedly groped her, another hit her with pepper spray, and yet another egged them on. ""You goddamn communist nigger-lover,"" said someone in the crowd, ""get the hell out of here.""

18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/why_donald_trump_won_t_fire_corey_lewandowski.html	"A normal presidential candidate, or congressional candidate, or person running for dogcatcher would treat the arrest of a top campaign official for battering a female reporter as a headline from which to run. But Donald Trump is not a normal anything, and he's not backing down from his defense of his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who was charged on Tuesday with simple battery. This refusal to ever say he was wrong about anything horrible he or his team have done is a big part of Trump's appeal among his core group of supporters. It will also, eventually, be his electoral end. Let's consider how Trump could get out of this particular latest horrible incident in a way that helped his campaign in the long run and demonstrated a baseline level of ethical maturity, were he so inclined, which he isn't. On Tuesday morning, Lewandowski, was charged in Jupiter, Florida over the March 8 incident when he grabbed (now former) Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields hard enough to bruise her. Newly released security-camera footage provides the latest unambiguous evidence that Lewandowski was lying when he said he didn't touch her. One thing that Trump could do, and any conventional campaign would have done a while ago, is fire Lewandowski. (Actually, were this a conventional campaign, Lewandowski would have immediately offered his resignation in recognition of the need to protect the candidate.) Trump could do this in a way that doesn't completely throw Lewandowski into the jaws of the law, too. He could say that while he doesn't think the incident in question amounts to a crime--or he believes that Lewandowski was just trying to protect him from the very dangerous Michelle Fields--the offense was that he lied about it. This is what a presidential candidate who (a) possessed an iota of decency and (b) hoped to be elected president might do. It would work for him in several ways. The media at large is salivating over the opportunity to launch a ""Trump is acting presidential"" narrative and has been sending smoke signals that it will set a very low bar for acceptable entries. A story such as ""Trump Fires Campaign Manager Charged With Battering Reporter"" would be such an entry. Firing a campaign manager charged specifically with battering a female reporter might also mark an opportunity to begin making repairs with the 70 percent of women who hate him, which is not to discount the many men who also find Lewandowski's behavior deplorable. And, of course, firing Lewandowski might be seen as a way for Trump to demonstrate his supposedly excellent leadership ability. An excellent leader or ""business manager,"" or what have you, would likely feel compelled to fire a subordinate who lied to him about battering a female reporter and thus embarrassed the entire enterprise. Trump could even go on camera and employ that popular television catchphrase of his, the one in which he tersely severs a contract of at-will employment. Judging by Trump's initial response to the charges, though--along with everything we know about him--it seems very much as though he will not pursue this strategy. For now, Trump is standing by Lewandowski and was still, somehow, calling into question Fields' credibility on Twitter on Tuesday. Like most of the words from Trump and his campaign, neither of these tweets make any sense. Yet--despite spewing this type of nonsensical fact-denying obfuscation as a matter of course--he stills retains a plurality of support from Republican primary voters and is the only candidate realistically capable of securing a majority of delegates. The path of his campaign is so strewn with incidents that would have buried a mere mortal, but with which he's gotten away, that his ability to get away with things has itself become a meta source of support. It implies dominance over his rivals--on the campaign trail, in the media, and in the world at large--and a certain segment of the Republican voter base appears to crave that above all in its presidential candidate. The nefarious phantasm against whom Trump is constantly pushing back --""this politically correct crap,"" as he might call it--tried to finish off Trump following his supposed ""gaffes"" regarding John McCain and Megyn Kelly last summer. But Trump didn't apologize--and continued to prosper. It's been the same pattern ever since, and it just encourages Trump to continue acting similarly. And it's the pattern that's going to be his ultimate undoing--if not at a contested convention, then almost certainly in a general-election matchup. Trump has backed himself into a corner. He has mastered the means of securing a plurality in a Republican primary by bullying and bluster, followed by refusal to back down and portraying that refusal as much-needed strength. But taking steps to ease concerns among Republican voters who aren't his base, much less with the general electorate, would require running a different campaign--one that might begin with, say, the firing of a campaign manager who lied about battering a female reporter and now faces criminal charges over the incident. Running a different campaign might have meant that he would have never gotten this far in the first place, but it's what he needs to do if he wants to become president. It would probably require being a different person, perhaps one with a barely sound moral compass. We've seen enough to rule out the possibility of that.

19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/why_did_ted_cruz_spend_seven_months_sucking_up_to_donald_trump.html	"""If you look at a number of the candidates that took on Donald Trump early on,"" Sen. Ted Cruz told Wisconsin radio host Charlie Sykes on Wednesday, ""they ended up as roadkill."" These comments mark the first public occasion of Cruz describing the rationale behind his roughly seven-month strategy of kissing Donald Trump's ass. Seven months ago seems like a quaint and gentler time in American politics, considering that Trump and his allies are now, for example, pushing the message that Heidi Cruz is Thomas Eagleton without the looks. These garbage attacks, which are really happening, worked the usually self-possessed Cruz into a lather on Thursday, culminating in Cruz calling Trump a ""sniveling coward."" (He was not so enraged, however, as to rule out supporting Trump should he become the nominee. Country comes first.) ""Our objective was simple from the beginning,"" Cruz continued in his conversation with Sykes. ""It is to win this race, to win the nomination, and then beat Hillary Clinton and turn this country around."" ""And not be roadkill,"" Sykes said. ""And not be roadkill,"" Cruz added. ""I am very strongly committed on the anti-roadkill approach."" This gets some recent history wrong. More importantly, it doesn't cut it as a morally exculpatory explanation for his behavior last year. Cruz is a smart, calculating politician, and surely from the beginning he recognized that Trump was a nightmarish fraud. The reasoning here that he didn't go after his principal rival for the nomination because he was worried about Trump trouncing him confirms cowardice on his part. It also promotes a causal myth about why those other candidates who did go after Trump became ""roadkill."" Worst of all, it portrays the relationship that Cruz sought with Trump too innocently. He wasn't making an end-run around Trump so much as he was using Trump as a tackle to clear his own lane through the field. To whom is Cruz referring with the flattering metaphor of ""roadkill""? Let us survey the dead. Dig deep into your memory and you might recall that former Texas Gov. Rick Perry not only ran for president this cycle but was the first candidate to take a hard swing at Trump. ""Donald Trump's candidacy is a cancer on conservatism,"" Perry said in a July anti-Trump speech, ""and it must be clearly diagnosed, excised, and discarded."" Then-governor of Louisiana Bobby Jindal similarly assaulted Trump in early September, calling him a ""narcissist"" and an ""egomaniac"" who ""has no understanding of policy"" and ""lacks the intellectual curiosity to even learn,"" among other (accurate) things. ""I think [Trump]'s a wrecking ball for the future of the Republican Party with the Hispanic community and we need to push back,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham told CNN in July. ""This is a defining moment for the Republican Party. We need to reject this."" The following day Trump displayed Graham's cellphone number at a public event. These candidates were among the first to drop out of the race. But contrary to popular myth, it wasn't the omnipotent Trump who took them out in single combat. Their candidacies were dead on arrival, and their efforts to go after Trump were desperate eleventh-hour maneuvers to win national publicity and earn slots on the main debating stage. This doesn't mean that they were making up their hatred of Trump, but the reason they felt so compelled to voice it then was because he was the channel through which media coverage flowed. They didn't lose because they were attacking Trump; they were attacking Trump because they were losing. Where was Cruz during all of this? He wasn't just keeping his distance from Trump in the campaign's early stages, as you could argue Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio were. He was actively courting and boosting Trump. The two had met in person ""at least five times"" by late August, the Daily Beast reported. One of those meetings, which produced a cheery thumbs-up photo op, went down at Trump Tower--by Cruz's request. ""I'm a big fan of Donald Trump. I think Donald Trump is bringing a bold, brash voice to this presidential race,"" Cruz said before the meeting. ""One of the reasons you're seeing so many 2016 candidates go out of their way to smack Donald Trump is they don't like a politician that speaks directly about the challenges of illegal immigration."" That gets to the heart of Cruz's ""bear hug"" of Trump in these months--to use the more apt term that Cruz himself offered last December, in private, to describe the relationship. Cruz was encouraging Trump's immigration talk because it exposed the main primary weakness of Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, whom he considered the real front-runners. Trump would tilt the electorate away from the ""establishment candidates""; Trump himself would eventually fade; and all of his supporters would migrate to Cruz. Trump reshaped the field, all right. But he didn't collapse. What's most inexcusable and morally shameful about Cruz during this time--and he would probably agree--is the way he stood down during some of Trump's vilest moments. When Trump insulted Sen. John McCain's war record in July, Cruz refused to criticize Trump and instead blamed the media for trying to incite ""Republican-on-Republican violence."" When Trump, following the first Fox News debate in August, said that moderator Megyn Kelly had ""blood coming out of her--wherever,"" Cruz again refused to take a stand. ""I'm not going to engage in the back-and-forth on personalities,"" he said. ""I get the media loves that. That's what you want to cover, is the soap opera of back-and-forth."" Now Trump is facing near-universal condemnation for his personal smears against Cruz's family. Cruz should consider himself lucky that others have a stronger sense of decency than he could ever muster during Trump's rise. Read more Slate coverage of the GOP primary."	Why Did Ted Cruz Spend Seven Months Sucking Up to Donald Trump?
20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/john_kasich_is_trying_to_destroy_the_gop_primary_process.html	"In Tuesday night's Arizona Republican presidential primary, Ohio Gov. John Kasich finished in fourth place to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who had suspended his campaign the previous week. Between the contests in Arizona and Utah, Kasich picked up zero delegates. Such an abysmal showing this late in the process, which dug his delegate hole to nearly 600 behind front-runner Donald Trump and about 300 behind Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, should have marked the end of his campaign. But according to Kasich's strategy for winning the nomination, these latest punishing losses were immaterial. There's something very, very wrong with this. His only remaining chance of winning the nomination, by taking his case to the convention, doesn't hinge on winning more states or delegates for himself prior to it. Even if he were to finish with 250 or 300 delegates as compared to his current total of 143, or win two or three states instead of his current one, it wouldn't mean anything; he'll end in a distant third place either way. It's true that Kasich's continued participation is of some use to the GOP's efforts to topple Trump, who is still very much headed for a plurality of delegates but can be blocked from getting a majority: Kasich can compete with Trump in Northeastern states like Pennsylvania where Cruz cannot. But Kasich has already been mathematically eliminated from reaching his own first-ballot delegate majority. His ""campaign"" now is about swaying delegates at the convention toward casting votes that are far different from the ones they were sent to Cleveland, by actual voters, to cast. These primary voters are themselves irrelevant to Kasich's grand scheme. If that sounds like the old days when state primaries weren't determinative of the nominee and party officials sorted everything out at the convention, that's because it would be. The precedent of a Kasich nomination at this point would be to establish that presidential primaries only matter when the voters go along with the preferences of a party's establishment. Actually, the plural preferences here may be incorrect. The party establishment really only has one preference: electability, since getting one party's candidate elected over the other party's is the purpose of a political party establishment. November electability is the entirety of Kasich's pitch to convention delegates, since he cannot argue in good faith that he represents Republican voters' will. When he says that ""neither Cruz nor Trump can win the general election [but I can],"" though, Kasich makes a strong argument. The latest poll from Bloomberg pins Trump's favorability at 29 percent versus 68 percent who view him unfavorably. Cruz is similarly stuck at 32 percent favorable to 55 percent unfavorable. Meanwhile, Kasich scores a positive favorability rating at 46 percent to 32 percent. In head-to-head matchups with likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton--also an unpopular politician, with a 44 percent favorable to 53 percent unfavorable score--Trump and Cruz lose to the former secretary of state by 18 and 9 points, respectively. Kasich beats her by four. Kasich may be correct about electability, but it's an argument Republican voters have been unresponsive to this cycle, as evidenced by Trump and Cruz's success. We went along with moderates Mitt Romney and John McCain when they told us to, and how did that turn out? is a sentiment that members of the Republican base express with great frequency at campaign events, conservative confabs, and on talk radio call-in shows. McCain and Romney were each probably the most electable Republican candidates in 2008 and 2012, respectively, even if they didn't win their general elections. But no matter. Their failures, plus Republican voters' hatred of their party establishment, have reflexively led base voters to do the opposite of what the establishment tells them to do this time around. Though that may be irrational, it is what the voters have chosen to do, and that is supposed to count for something. Since this cycle's (remaining) electable candidate, Kasich, isn't gaining much traction among voters with his case, he's planning to take it straight to convention attendees to whom voters' nominating powers are delegated. Delegates tend to be Republican activists or officials in local, state and federal parties, the thinking goes, so they might be more receptive to the idea of nominating based on electability. That would run counter to delegates' interest in staying true to Republican voters' stated preferences, of course, and perhaps not causing riots. But the only things bounding them to do so after the first ballot are ethical norms, which in American public life are rapidly being torched to nothingness. If Kasich wins the nomination after effectively determining that primary voters' preferences needn't count, then that establishes primary voters' preferences needn't count. At least a Cruz nomination at the convention after a strong second-place primary finish would acknowledge and respect the anti-establishment signal voters have been sending the GOP. Nominating Kasich would be a middle finger to primary voters. They didn't want to play along this time? Well, here's what happens. Then the GOP will have to ask itself: Once the cat's out of the bag that voters can signal one preference and convention delegates can do something else entirely, why bother hosting primaries?"	If John Kasich Gets His Way, It Would Effectively Destroy the GOP Primary Process
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/trump_democrats_are_a_myth.html	"Donald Trump is wily, unpredictable, unprincipled, and opportunistic. And for some observers, this makes him a formidable prospect in a general election. ""To be successful as a Republican candidate you have to be the equivalent of a neutron bomb,"" said Republican strategist Steve Schmidt to the Washington Post. ""He's a neutron bomb. Donald Trump has been disruptive in the way Uber has been disruptive in the taxi industry."" ""I think there's a lot of Reagan Democrats waiting to vote for him,"" said Chris Matthews during a January broadcast of his MSNBC show Hardball. ""I think Pennsylvania might well be in play if he's the nominee because he's unpredictable."" Because Trump isn't a doctrinaire conservative--because he appeals on emotion and not policy--the theory is that he can win white working-class Democrats and other disaffected voters in the Democratic coalition. Trump, incidentally, agrees. ""I have a chance of winning New York. You know, you look at these politicians [and] they always talk about the six states--you've got to win this one, that one. You have to win Ohio, you have to win Florida,"" he said last month. ""I can change the game because I really have a chance of New York, I'm going to win Virginia. I'm going to win Michigan, as an example."" But there's a big problem with this theory, which also underlies a cottage industry of fan fiction about the presidential election: There's no evidence. At this stage of the election, there is nothing that points to any Democratic support or enthusiasm for Trump. Instead, it's just the opposite. Trump is deeply unpopular with Democratic voters. Even white ones. According to the Reuters tracking poll, which follows responses over time to measure changes in support or opinion, more than 73 percent of whites who voted for President Obama in the last presidential election hold a negative opinion of Trump, versus 27 percent who hold a favorable opinion. It's difficult to do a direct comparison, but this is in line with Mitt Romney's standing among white self-identified liberals in the September before the 2012 election. Better is an apples-to-apples comparison between Trump and his nearest rival, Ted Cruz. Whites who voted for Obama like Cruz--a doctrinaire conservative ideologue--about as much as they like Trump, 28 percent favorable to 72 percent unfavorable. What about working-class whites? As it stands, the real estate mogul breaks even among whites with a high school degree (a rough measure of ""working class""), 52 percent favorable to 48 percent unfavorable. Among those who voted for Obama, this drops to 27 percent favorable to 73 percent unfavorable, tying Cruz on both scores. Trump, in other words, is about as liked among working-class Democratic whites as the least-popular Republican politician left in the field. This is in line with a focus group of white working-class voters conducted by Working America, an affiliate of the AFL-CIO, which canvassed neighborhoods outside of Cleveland and Pittsburgh. Ninety percent of respondents voted in 2012, and among ""decided"" Democrats, 25 percent backed Trump. But when you counted all Democrats--those without a candidate choice as well as those with one--just 11 percent backed Trump. None of this should be shocking. Missing in the discussion of working-class whites and the Democratic Party is the degree to which Democrats have already lost much of the white working class. Just 36 percent of whites without college degrees voted for Obama in 2012, when he won the election by a 4-point margin in the popular vote, picking up 26 states (and the District of Columbia) and 330 electoral college votes. Democrats don't need to win working-class whites or even to come close--they just need to stem their losses. And even that's less acute than it's been. A growing Hispanic and Asian electorate, along with steady black voting, has tilted the electoral board a little more in the Democrats' favor, giving them a greater cushion with white voters. On the other side, without an influx of minority voters--which isn't happening--Republicans need supermajorities of all white voters to win, even in Rust Belt states where Trump allegedly has his greatest appeal. And as Greg Sargent points out for the Washington Post, this is a huge reach. To win Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Ohio on the strength of working-class whites, Trump would have to beat Romney's totals by an average of 12 points, assuming he doesn't lose any college-educated whites or see worse performance with nonwhites. If you broaden the analysis to all whites, Trump has to improve on Romney by an average of 8 points--a difficult challenge, even before you consider the Democratic campaign against him. The basic truth is that Donald Trump is one of the most unpopular figures in national politics. He's disliked (or despised) by a large majority of Americans. This isn't because the public doesn't know him. With nearly $2 billion in free coverage from news networks--dwarfing Hillary Clinton's $746 million--the public knows him well. And they don't like what they see. Far from scrambling political alliances in his favor, Trump may be the key to further gains for Democrats, from solidifying an advantage with Hispanics to making inroads with college-educated whites. If Trump upends the fall presidential race, it likely won't be because he's gamed the system or discovered a new, unprecedented path to a majority. It will be because, like Ozymandias' creature, he united a divided electorate against him, in a broad effort to save the country from its worse impulses. See more of Slate's 2016 election coverage."	The Myth of the Trump Democrat
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/donald_trump_has_one_core_philosophy_misogyny.html	"On the eve of the election, Slate's revisiting our best stories from the campaign. How did we get here? Read on. Donald Trump holds one core belief. It's not limited government. He favored a state takeover of health care before he was against it. Nor is it economic populism. Despite many years of arguing the necessity of taxing the rich, he now wants to slice their rates to bits. Trump has claimed his nonlinear approach to policy is a virtue. Closing deals is what matters in the end, he says, not unbleached allegiance to conviction. But there's one ideology that he does hold with sincerity and practices with unwavering fervor: misogyny. We have been collectively blithe about this fact. On its face, Donald Trump's hateful musings about women and his boastful claims of sexual dominance should be reason alone to drive him from polite society and certainly to blockade him from the West Wing. Yet somehow his misogyny has instead propelled his campaign to the brink of the Republican nomination. Each demonstration of his caveman views--about Megyn Kelly's menstruation, about Carly Fiorina's face, about the size of his member--produces a show of mock-horror before Trump resumes his march to the nomination. It fits a familiar pattern. Trump rose to fame on the basis of our prurient interest in his caddishness and amusement at his vulgar provocations. Trump wants us to know all about his sex life. He doesn't regard sex as a private activity. It's something he broadcasts to demonstrate his dominance, of both women and men. In his view, treating women like meat is a necessary precondition for winning, and winning is all that matters in his world. By winning, Trump means asserting superiority. And since life is a zero-sum game, superiority can only be achieved at someone else's expense. This was a view etched in Trump from an early age. He was the archetypal brat. His father, himself a successful real estate developer, endlessly expressed a belief in his son's greatness. ""You are a king,"" his father would tell Donald, according to his biographer Michael D'Antonio. His son took that to mean he could set his own rules. In elementary school, he gave one teacher he didn't like a black eye; others were pelted with erasers. At birthday parties, he would fling cake. Not even Trump's father's wealth, nor his father's faith in his son's destiny, could save Trump from incessant discipline. At the age of 13, he was shipped off to the New York Military Academy, which employed brutal tactics for the remaking of delinquent character, even resorting to violence to assert control over the boys. ""In those days they'd smack the hell out of you. It was not like today where you smack somebody and you go to jail,"" Trump has recalled. The struggle for domination permeated the culture of the place, especially the manner in which boys treated one another. According to one NPR report, Trump would tear off the sheets of boys who didn't make their beds properly; he would laugh while his classmates spoke, putting them in their place. But Trump's primary method for asserting dominance was sex. The school's yearbook--the perfectly named Shrapnel--anointed him the official ""ladies man"" of the class. He began his lifelong practice of advertising his bedroom exploits as a means of demonstrating his authority over the rest of the locker room. Decades later, he's still trumpeting his sexual exploits. When Tucker Carlson once mocked him on air, Trump called the pundit and left a voicemail: ""It's true you have better hair than I do. But I get more pussy than you do."" Such boasting is an essential part of his patter. In 2001, he phoned into The Howard Stern Show to discuss his feats of cuckoldry. The occasion for the call was the guest appearance of a gossip columnist from the Daily News named A.J. Benza, who was shilling for his book, Fame, Ain't It a Bitch. The tome included the admission that Benza's girlfriend had left him for Trump. Most men who would go on to become major-party nominees would have run in the other direction from such a spectacle; Trump couldn't resist. ""I've been successful with your girlfriend, I'll tell you that,"" Trump told Stern's audience. ""While you were getting onto the plane to go to California thinking that she was your girlfriend, she was some place that you wouldn't have been very happy with."" It was characteristic bit of braggadocio. As he wrote in The Art of the Comeback: ""If I told the real stories of my experiences with women, often seemingly very happily married and important women, this book would be a guaranteed best-seller.""* It's an entirely Darwinian view, where the alpha male has his pick of females, both as a perk and a means of flexing his power over lesser men. It's the mindset that made his assertion of his penis size in a national debate almost an imperative--if he let the attack on his manhood slide, his entire edifice might crumble. Trump considers himself such a virile example of masculinity that he's qualified to serve as the ultimate arbiter of femininity. He relishes judging women on the basis of their looks, which he seems to believe amounts to the sum of their character. Walking out of his meeting with the Washington Post editorial board this week, he paused to pronounce editor Karen Attiah ""beautiful."" When he owned the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants, he would screen all the contestants. His nominal reason for taking on this role was to make sure that his lackeys weren't neglecting any beauties. His real motive was to humiliate the women. He would ask a contestant to name which of her competitors she found ""hot."" If he didn't consider a woman up to his standards, he would direct her to stand with her fellow ""discards."" One of the contestants, Carrie Prejean, wrote about this in her book, Still Standing: ""Some of the girls were sobbing backstage after [Trump] left, devastated to have failed even before the competition really began ... even those of us who were among the chosen couldn't feel very good about it--it was as though we had been stripped bare."" Humiliating women by decrying their ugliness is an almost recreational pastime for Trump. When the New York Times columnist Gail Collins described him as a ""financially embittered thousandaire,"" he sent her a copy of the column with her picture circled. ""The Face of a Dog!"" he scrawled over her visage. This is the tack he took with Carly Fiorina, when he described her facial appearance as essentially disqualifying her from the presidency. It's the method he's used to denounce Cher, Bette Midler, Angelina Jolie, and Rosie O'Donnell--""fat ass,"" ""slob, ""extremely unattractive,"" etc.--when they had the temerity to criticize him. The joy he takes in humiliating women is not something he even bothers to disguise. He told the journalist Timothy L. O'Brien, ""My favorite part [of the movie Pulp Fiction] is when Sam has his gun out in the diner and he tells the guy to tell his girlfriend to shut up. Tell that bitch to be cool. Say: 'Bitch be cool.' I love those lines."" Or as he elegantly summed up his view to New York magazine in the early '90s, ""Women, you have to treat them like shit."" When presented with the long list of his demeaning comments, Trump has responded, ""I respect women, I love women, I cherish women."" Indeed, he has hired and promoted women within his companies. ""They've been among my best people,"" he wrote in The Art of the Deal.* The line reveals more than he intends. He's perfectly comfortable with female underlings, his people--less so when women question him sharply, as Megyn Kelly has, or compete against him, as Carly Fiorina did. He's perfectly blunt about this power dynamic. In a 1994 interview with ABC News, he explained, ""I have really given a lot of women great opportunity. Unfortunately, after they are a star, the fun is over for me."" He means it. He brought along one of his deputies, Carolyn Kepcher, to appear on The Apprentice. But he couldn't stand her growing fame, and fired her for becoming a ""prima donna."" Women labor under a cloud of Trump's distrust. ""I have seen women manipulate men with just a twitch of their eye--or perhaps another body part,"" he wrote in Trump: The Art of the Comeback. Working moms are particularly lacking in loyalty, he believes, and thus do not make for good employees. ""She's not giving me 100 percent. She's giving me 84 percent, and 16 percent is going towards taking care of children,"" he told Mika Brzezinski. (Further evidence of his dim view of working moms: Trump once notoriously blurted that the pumping of breast milk in the office is ""disgusting."") This is one reason that evangelicals, both men and women, gravitate to Trump, despite his obvious lack of interest in religion and blatantly loose morals. He represents the possibility of a return to patriarchy, to a time when men were men, and didn't have to apologize for it. While he celebrates his own sexuality, he believes that female sexuality has spun out of control and needs to be contained. The best example of this view is a reality show called Lady or a Tramp, which Trump developed for Fox but never aired. The premise of the show was that Trump would take ""girls in love with the party life"" and send them off for a ""stern course"" on manners. ""We are all sick and tired of the glamorization of these out-of-control young women,"" he told Variety, ""so I have taken it upon myself to do something about it."" How will Trump cope with a general-election race against a woman? We've seen hints. Describing Hillary Clinton's 2008 primary loss, he resorted to a crude metaphor--she'd been schlonged by then-Sen. Obama. As always in Trump's world, sex is power. When Clinton suggested that Trump has ""demonstrated a penchant for sexism,"" he fired back by invoking the sins of her husband: ""She's got one of the great women-abusers of all time sitting in her house, waiting for her to come home to dinner."" There's a case for subjecting Bill Clinton to far harsher scrutiny, but Donald Trump is the last person with the moral standing to make it. The former Newsweek reporter Harry Hurt III described Trump's history of assault in his book, The Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump. In 1989, Trump had returned home from a painful scalp-reduction surgery, intended to remove a bald spot. His ex-wife Ivana had suggested the doctor--and he blamed her for his suffering. He held her arms and began pulling hair from her scalp, then tore off her clothes. Hurt writes: ""Then he jams his penis inside her for the first time in more than sixteen months. Ivana is terrified ... It is a violent assault. According to versions she repeats to some of her closest confidantes, 'he raped me.' "" When the story resurfaced last summer, Trump's campaign disavowed it. When Hurt was writing his book, Trump's lawyers forced the author to include a statement from Ivana in the book, ""A Note to Readers,"" which softens the account but doesn't disavow it: ""As a woman, I felt violated, as the love and tenderness, which he normally exhibited towards me, was absent. I referred to this as a 'rape,' but I do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense."" The scene offers a graphic summation of Trump's retrograde beliefs and real brutality. What's worse, the same spirit informs his politics--the rampant cruelty, the violent impulses, the thirst for revenge, the absence of compassion. Misogyny isn't an incidental part of Donald Trump. It's who he is. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign. *Correction, March 25, 2016: This article originally misstated that the ""If I told the real stories of my experiences with women ...

23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/values_vs_tribalism_what_kind_of_foreign_policy_does_america_want.html	"Beirut, Paris, San Bernardino, Ankara, Brussels. We can't escape terrorism, but we can decide how to deal with it. In this year's election, we face a choice between two ways of responding. One is tribalism. The other is values. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton presented these alternatives in their remarks on Monday to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. AIPAC is the biggest pro-Israel lobby in the United States. Its membership is overwhelmingly Jewish, and that's the angle Trump chose to play. He pointed out, as he has in debates and in a previous speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition, that his daughter married a Jew and converted. He kvelled over his Jewish grandkids. Trump often mentions the ""massive contributions"" he has made to Israel and to Jewish organizations, the awards he has received in thanks, and a pro-Israel parade in which he served as grand marshal. He says his father was a big Israel backer, too. Jews are his people. It's a family thing. This pitch works not just on many Jews, but also on conservative Christians who think of Israel as, in Trump's words, a ""cultural brother."" As Ben Carson put it last month: ""We have a Judeo-Christian foundation, and the last thing we need to do is to reject Israel. ... It's like when you have a child. You know, you want to be fair to all the children around, but you have a special attention for your own child."" From this point of view, outreach to other faiths is treachery. Sen. Marco Rubio, for instance, says President Obama ""betrayed Israel, because he believes that if we create separation from Israel, it will help our relations in the Islamic world."" Trump, too, casts Obama as disloyal. ""Radical Islamic terrorism,"" the GOP front-runner complained in his speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition. ""We have a president who refuses to use the term. He refuses to say it. There's something going on with him that we don't know about."" In a question-and-answer session at the RJC, Trump was asked whether Clinton was ""a friend of Israel."" He replied that she ""doesn't have the strength"" to help the Jewish state. Israel is up against ""dirty fighters,"" Trump explained. To defeat that enemy, he argued, ""We need tough. We need Gen. George Patton. We need Gen. MacArthur."" He praised Patton as a ""vicious, horrible, brilliant"" general and pledged to ""knock the crap out of"" the enemy. When tribalism is your only guide, reluctance to use extreme measures is weakness. Clinton, in her speech to AIPAC, offered a different approach. She described a U.S.-Israeli friendship based on ""shared democratic values,"" not kinship. ""We are both nations built by immigrants and exiles seeking to live and worship in freedom--nations built on principles of equality, tolerance, and pluralism,"" she argued. Clinton cited Israel's free-wheeling political debates and its gay pride parade. She concluded: ""Let's defend the shared values that already make America and Israel great."" In a shared-values framework, foreign peoples and faith traditions aren't necessarily your enemies. They can be objects of empathy. Clinton drew an analogy between Trump's proposed ban on Muslims and an infamous U.S. exclusion of Jewish refugees: ""We remember the nearly 1,000 Jews aboard the St. Louis who were refused entry in 1939 and sent back to Europe. ... If you see bigotry, oppose it. If you see violence, condemn it. If you see a bully, stand up to him."" In a shared-values framework, everyone, including you and your cultural brother, has to meet moral standards. ""Today, Americans and Israelis face currents of intolerance and extremism that threaten the moral foundations of our societies,"" Clinton warned. Without using Trump's name, she condemned his behavior: ""encouraging violence, playing coy with white supremacists, calling for 12 million immigrants to be rounded up and deported, demanding we turn away refugees because of their religion, and proposing a ban on all Muslims entering the United States."" The values approach requires tough love. If we support Israel for its democracy, not for its Judaism, we have to speak up when it threatens to become undemocratic. A two-state solution is ""the only way to guarantee Israel's long-term survival as a strong Jewish and democratic state,"" Clinton told AIPAC. To facilitate peace, she added, ""Everyone has to do their part by avoiding damaging actions, including with respect to settlements."" She portrayed outreach to the Palestinians as strength, not weakness: ""America needs an Israel strong enough to deter and defend against its enemies, strong enough to work with us to tackle shared challenges, and strong enough to take bold steps in the pursuit of peace."" The argument against a foreign policy of shared values is that it can blind you to personal loyalty and the importance of alliances. That's what Trump, in his remarks to AIPAC, said of Obama: ""He constantly applies pressure to our friends and rewards our enemies."" But a foreign policy of tribalism carries a more insidious risk: The real enemy is barbarism, and it can infiltrate your soul. Trump is a chilling illustration of this corruption. He says we should relax our human rights protections and military ethics ""so that we can better compete with a vicious group of animals."" He advocates retributive torture and the deliberate targeting of family members of terrorists. To defeat religious conflict, he would ban a particular religion. To punish protesters at his rallies, he encourages violence against them. The barbarism infection has spread well beyond Trump. At AIPAC, he denounced Iran for ""offering Palestinians $7,000 per terror attack and $30,000 for every Palestinian terrorist's home that's been destroyed--a deplorable, deplorable situation."" Thousands of well-dressed people applauded this line, apparently oblivious to--or untroubled by--the distinction between subsidizing terrorism and compensating families whose homes are destroyed by Israel when a family member is arrested on a terrorism charge. Israel's demolition policy is explicitly based on collective punishment: the idea that a potential terrorist ""should know that his criminal acts will not only hurt him, but are apt to cause great suffering to his family."" It is Trumpism in practice. In France, Belgium, Israel, and California, you can see the war of tribes: Muslim terrorists are targeting and killing non-Muslim Westerners. But you can also see the war of values: Some of us are choosing Clinton's ethics, and some are choosing Trump's. Look at the survey of Israelis released by the Pew Research Center two weeks ago. More than three-quarters of Israel's religious and ultra-Orthodox Jews believe that halakha, the Jewish counterpart to Sharia, should be state law. Three-quarters believe that if halakha conflicts with ""democratic principles,"" the country should choose halakha. Nearly two-thirds believe that ""Arabs should be expelled or transferred from Israel."" Polls taken in Israel by the Israel Democracy Institute show how tribalism has eroded Jewish values. Thirty-six percent of Israeli Jews, including a majority of Jews who vote for the two major ultra-Orthodox parties, agree that ""the interrogation of Jews suspected of terror attacks should be done with less harsh methods than those used in interrogating Palestinians suspected of terror attacks."" Thirty percent, including most Jews who vote for the ultra-Orthodox parties, agree that ""the punishment the court imposes on Jews found guilty of terror attacks against Palestinians should be lighter than the punishment it imposes on Palestinians found guilty of terror attacks against Jews."" Eighty percent of Israeli Jews agree that ""the home of the family of a Palestinian who has murdered Jews for nationalistic reasons should be destroyed,"" but only 41 percent agree that ""the home of the family of a Jew who has murdered Palestinians for nationalistic reasons should be destroyed."" Fifty-three percent affirm that ""any Palestinian who has perpetrated a terror attack against Jews should be killed on the spot, even if he has been apprehended and no longer poses a threat."" This erosion of values isn't a Jewish disease, any more than terrorism is inherently a Muslim disease. It can happen to any of us. Israel simply faces more terrorism than the United States does, and therefore greater pressure on its morals and laws. It's a warning of where we're headed. In an ABC News/Washington Post poll taken a little more than a year ago, 58 percent of Americans said that ""torture of suspected terrorists"" was often or sometimes justified. One of every three conservative Republicans said torture was often justified. And in an ABC/Post poll taken earlier this month, one-third of Americans, including a majority of Republicans and Republican-leaning voters, endorsed ""a ban on Muslims entering the United States."" To protect your values, you have to remember why your allies are your allies. ""America can't ever be neutral when it comes to Israel's security or survival,"" Clinton told AIPAC. ""We can't be neutral when rockets rain down on residential neighborhoods, when civilians are stabbed in the street, when suicide bombers target the innocent."" Ultimately, that's not a commitment to Israel. It's a commitment to the principle of innocence. Israel has to live up to that principle, and so do we. The problem with Trump, Clinton explained, is that he thinks ""everything's negotiable."" She's right about that. But Trump's flaw isn't an indifference to Israel. It's an indifference to rules. Toward the end of her remarks, Clinton quoted Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel: ""Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim."" That kind of neutrality--moral neutrality--is the most dangerous of all. ""Let us never be neutral or silent in the face of bigotry,"" she concluded. It's hard to remember that warning as we watch the carnage in Brussels. So Clinton, in a statement on Tuesday morning, repeated it. ""These terrorists seek to undermine the democratic values that are the foundation of our alliance and our way of life,"" she declared. ""But they will never succeed."" Unless we surrender."	Values vs. Tribalism: What Kind of Foreign Policy Does America Want?
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/why_terrorism_doesn_t_help_donald_trump.html	"Americans who read outlets like the New York Times woke up to detailed and largely accurate information about Tuesday's attacks in Brussels, which killed and wounded dozens. Americans who watched cable news, on the other hand, woke up to Donald Trump, who presented these attacks--like the ones in Paris--as a boon for his campaign. ""This is a subject that is very dear and near to my heart, because I've been talking about it much more than anybody else,"" he said. ""And it's probably why I'm No. 1 in the polls. Because of the fact that I say we have to have strong borders. We have to be very vigilant and careful who we allow into our country."" Meanwhile, some journalists were frustrated with the networks' choice to give attention to Trump and essentially let him campaign on the destruction in Brussels before the bodies had even been counted. "" 'Terrorist attacks help Trump' isn't a thing that just happens. It happens because after attacks, voters see his face on every TV network,"" wrote Jill Filipovic, a columnist for the Guardian. ""America may be one major terrorist attack from Donald Trump as president,"" said Blake Hounshell, editorial director at Politico. Both Trump and his critics are operating from the belief that terrorism, even abroad, helps the most reactionary and illiberal candidates in an election. Trump was the chief GOP beneficiary of the Paris attacks, which helped him build a larger lead over his rivals. In an apparently anti-establishment year, with many Americans driven variously by economic anxiety, racism, and deep fears of external threat, it's easy to believe that Trump could ride the Brussels attack to more votes and a shorter path to the White House. At the same time, there's reason to think this just isn't true. Americans do become more conservative in the face of physical threat. Fears over terrorism, for example, helped George W. Bush win a second term. But Bush was a sitting president who led the national response after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. For millions of Americans, he was a credible voice on the subject. The same is not true of Donald Trump. As evidenced by his almost absurdist dialogue with the editorial board of the Washington Post, Trump doesn't know anything about terrorism or national security. When asked about his proposed ban on Muslims, for example, Trump gave the Post's Fred Hiatt a stream of words that carried no actual meaning: ""Well look, there's many exceptions. There's many--everything, you're going to go through a process. But we have to be very careful. And I was really referring in particular, you know, to migrations--Syrians, the whole migration, where we're going to take in thousands. And I heard in the Democrat debate, I heard 55,000, okay. 55,000."" He spoke this way throughout the interview, and in fact one thing we've learned from the constant coverage of the candidate is that he always speaks this way. The ignorance, demonstrated daily, even hourly, has had an effect among Americans writ large. According to the most recent Washington Post national poll, just 40 percent of Americans trust that Trump can handle terrorism better than Hillary Clinton. Just 37 percent say the same for immigration issues, and just 32 percent say the same for an international crisis. Indeed, as Nate Silver shows for FiveThirtyEight, not even GOP voters are thrilled with Trump's ability to handle crisis, or even terrorism. And in a YouGov survey from earlier this month, 60 percent of Americans say that Trump is not ready to serve as ""commander-in-chief."" Republican voters didn't flock to Trump after the Paris attacks because they trusted his leadership; they flocked to him because he leveraged the attacks into a larger anti-Muslim message that attracted the substantial portion of Republican primary voters with strong anti-Muslim views and deep concern over immigration. It's possible that this could carry over to a general election, as a foreign or domestic terror attack activates anti-Muslim attitudes among the general public. And it's true that in the aftermath of the attacks in San Bernardino, California, Obama's approval rating dipped, suggesting just that kind of response. But it's also true that Obama's approval quickly resumed its upward climb, as Americans moved on to other issues and concerns. The broad picture, however, is easy to see and understand. Americans as a whole don't see Trump as ready to defend the country. There, thanks to a long (and accurate) reputation for hawkishness, Hillary Clinton has the advantage. But Trump's rhetoric on terrorism and national security matters in a larger sense. After Paris, the real estate mogul called for a ban on Muslim entry to the United States, staking out and in the process normalizing an extreme position. In turn, other candidates have tried to outbid him. ""We need to immediately halt the flow of refugees from countries with a significant al Qaida or ISIS presence,"" said Ted Cruz in a statement from his campaign. ""We need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized."" One Republican presidential candidate wants to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. His immediate rival wants to put Muslim Americans under constant surveillance. Trump may not ride fear to the White House, but he can use it to continue to erode our basic norms and ideals. Read more of Slate's coverage of the Brussels terror attacks."	Why Terrorism Doesn't Help Donald Trump
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/hillary_clinton_s_aipac_speech_was_a_symphony_of_craven_delusional_pandering.html	"Any presidential candidate speaking to AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, during an election year is going to bow to the hawkish elements of the Israel lobby. Hillary Clinton's keynote speech at AIPAC's annual meeting Monday, however, was more debased than it needed to be, promising that under her administration, Israel will be spared even the mild rebukes it has suffered under President Obama. A symphony of pandering, it attempted to outflank Donald Trump on the right and will end up outraging a large chunk of the left. As Joe Biden acknowledged in his AIPAC speech on Sunday, Israel's ""steady and systematic process of expanding settlements, legalizing outposts, seizing land"" is making a two-state solution impossible. The settlements are pushing Israel toward a one-state reality, in which Jews rule over the Arabs with whom they are geographically intermingled. Clinton's speech, however, barely nodded toward this reality, and when it did, it was with a promise to protect Israel from the consequences of flouting international law. Here is the entirety of Clinton's remarks about settlements: ""Everyone has to do their part by avoiding damaging actions, including with respect to settlements. Now, America has an important role to play in supporting peace efforts. And as president, I would continue the pursuit of direct negotiations. And let me be clear--I would vigorously oppose any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution, including by the U.N. Security Council."" She spent significantly more time railing against the ""alarming"" Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement, which is gaining traction on college campuses nationwide. Pledging to ""take our alliance to the next level,"" Clinton said that one of the first things she'd do in office is invite the Israeli prime minister to the White House. That was a barely veiled rebuke to Obama, who never treated Benjamin Netanyahu with the deference the prime minister felt entitled to. Before the speech, some had hoped that Clinton might offer a word of solidarity or encouragement to beleaguered progressives in Israel. She gave them nothing. It's understandable that Clinton would want to widen the gulf between AIPAC and Donald Trump, the likely Republican nominee. ""We need steady hands, not a president who says he's neutral on Monday, pro-Israel on Tuesday, and who knows what on Wednesday, because everything is negotiable,"" she said to applause, out-hawking the man who is running on a platform of Middle Eastern war crimes. In doing so, she offered a bridge to #NeverTrump neoconservatives like Max Boot and Robert Kagan, who has already written that, should Trump be the nominee, ""the only choice will be to vote for Hillary Clinton. The party cannot be saved, but the country still can be."" Anti-Trump neoconservatives, however, are a minuscule group of people. And in seeking their approval, Clinton has further alienated left-wing voters, particularly young ones. Polls show that Americans under 30 are far more critical of Israel than are older voters. Liberal Democrats sympathize more with the Palestinians than they do with Israel. There is already deep suspicion of Clinton's foreign-policy instincts among Bernie Sanders' supporters; Clinton doesn't need to give them new reasons to distrust her. This year of all years, Clinton could have afforded to show a bit of courage before AIPAC. Jews will vote Democratic no matter what. Sixty-nine percent of them voted for Obama in 2012, despite the well-known tension between him and Netanyahu. Unlike Obama, Clinton is going to be running against a demagogue with German roots who plays footsie with white supremacists and reportedly kept a volume of Hitler's speeches beside his bed. She'll have all the Jewish support she needs without sucking up to the Likud. So why is she doing it? Her correspondence with adviser Sid Blumenthal--a man loathed by the Israel lobby for not disavowing his anti-Zionist son, Max--suggests that she's aware of the damage Netanyahu is doing to the cause of peace in the Middle East. But if she is, she doesn't care about it enough to take even a tiny political risk, to tell a crowd something other than exactly what it wants to hear. Either Clinton's AIPAC speech was driven by belief, or it was driven by cynicism. It's hard to say which is worse."	Hillary Clinton's Speech to AIPAC Was a Symphony of Craven, Delusional Pandering
26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/03/on_the_trail_with_donald_trump_s_disgusting_press_corps.html	"On the eve of the election, Slate's revisiting our best stories from the campaign. How did we get here? Read on. On March 11, an hour before the scheduled start of a Donald Trump rally in Chicago, I checked into the venue's media pen--a rectangle of metal bike racks corralling the press--and introduced myself to a few of the journalists there. I was talking to Sopan Deb, a CBS News reporter who's been following the Trump campaign for months, when the first protest erupted in the crowd. Trump supporters had encircled some guys wearing ""Muslims United Against Donald Trump"" T-shirts. Deb excused himself, hoisted his video camera onto his shoulder, and sprinted out of the pen for a better angle on the hubbub. When he returned, he set down his camera and resumed chatting with me as though nothing had happened. A newspaper writer sidled over to join our pleasant conversation. Within a minute or two, another protester was yelling. My new pals swiveled their heads, quickly pinpointed the disturbance, and raced back into the crowd. Was this the normal gig? ""Totally normal,"" said Deb, safely in the pen once more, unfazed by the brewing rancor. ""People think it's new, but this has been going on at Trump rallies since at least November. There'll be 10 more of those tonight."" As the planned start time for the event drew near, a pair of men with Trump pins on the lapels of their suits sealed the media pen's exit. ""They're not allowed to leave anymore,"" I overheard one suit instruct the other. ""Not until he""--the ""he"" being Trump--""has left the building."" The flare-ups continued and intensified. Police swarmed into the stands. Everyone was on their feet, shouting and pointing. When a PA announcement informed us that the event had been canceled, the place detonated. Reporters scurried to edges of the media pen, still hemmed in, and leaned their cameras over the barricades. Realizing this was folly, they soon mounted a jailbreak. I followed them and found myself amid a churning mob on the arena floor--scuffles everywhere, people shrieking at each other, ripping signs from hands, knocking hats from heads, shoving, stumbling. The cameras raced from one brawl to the next. When the bedlam flowed outside, I went to a spot where protesters were screaming at people trying to exit the parking garage in their cars. Trump supporters on the garage's upper levels were jeering at the protesters below, throwing popcorn. ""Oh, you're gonna spit on us now?"" said an angry protester, looking up into what did appear to be a hail of expectoration. I saw a newspaper reporter I'd just met inside wading into the fray with her notebook in hand, trying to gather quotes. The next morning, scanning news about the rally, I learned that Deb--while attempting to film the ruckus in the streets--had been thrown to the ground by Chicago cops, handcuffed, arrested, and detained in jail.* * * * Jeb Bush rallies were not like this. Covering a Jeb event meant freely mingling with 40 people sitting calmly on folding chairs. Covering a Trump event is like watching a 1970s Black Flag concert from inside a shark cage. What's it like to be on the Trump beat all the time? To have enlisted for the noble civic duty of election reportage, only to find yourself smack at the center of tinderbox crowds and pro-wrestling atmospherics? Is it tough to endure the troubling, media-bashing behavior of the Trump campaign itself? I followed the circus from Chicago to Cleveland and then down to Florida for a series of rallies, hanging out with Trump's press pack along the way to find out. When they weren't busy darting from one skirmish to the next, several Trump reporters (who spoke anonymously because they were not willing or permitted by their news organizations to go on the record) described their experiences out on the trail. The first thing they all said about Trump's press operation was that ""there is no Trump press operation."" There's just Hope Hicks, a twentysomething former Ralph Lauren model who's never previously worked in politics. She functions more like a celebrity PR shop than a political communications team. And she remains a remote figure. On other campaigns, the press operatives develop chummy relationships with the press corps. ""There's no collegiality,"" said one reporter. ""No one's getting dinner with Hope."" While Hicks writes up the emails and press releases, Trump is his own media strategist. And in some ways he's the most accessible candidate of all--as long as you're a TV host like CNN's Don Lemon or MSNBC's Joe Scarborough. But there's no behind-the-scenes information coming from his campaign, no one else but Trump (and occasionally his campaign manager) to talk to. Where other candidates might have a dozen aides a journalist can develop as sources, along with donors and pollsters and ad-makers who'll leak inside scoop, with Trump there's none of that. Maybe you get some state-level operatives on the phone, but it doesn't matter because they never know anything. ""You don't get sourced up like you normally would,"" one reporter told me. ""It all happens on the surface. You just try to interpret it."" Asking policy questions is like throwing a rock down a bottomless well. ""If I have a question about women's issues, or Hispanic issues,"" said one reporter, ""it's not like they point me to specific press liaisons who handle those. There aren't any such people."" Most policy queries simply go unanswered. When a response does come back, it's rarely sufficient. ""There's no point anyway,"" said another reporter. ""You might get a response to a question about immigration policy, but the next day on TV, Trump will contradict it."" And of course there are the lies. Politico Magazine tallied more than 60 in a week of Trump appearances. At a rally in Boca Raton, Florida, on March 13, I heard him utter at least two bald untruths in the first two minutes of his speech (he said there were 25,000 people at his Chicago rally when the arena holds fewer than 10,000, and then he repeated the falsehood that no one had been injured at the event). But journalists I talked to who continue to report the lies as such don't feel their efforts have much effect. ""How many times can you write that the same statement is untrue?"" mused one reporter. ""At some point, the lie stops being news."" And debunking a claim doesn't stop Trump from making it again. The hokum washes over you after a while. A reporter sitting next to me at the Saturday rally in Cleveland chuckled when Trump bragged there were 29,000 people in the room. ""That can't be remotely possible,"" she said, lifting her head for a moment to assess the crowd, then giving up and returning her gaze to her laptop. A fire marshal later announced the attendance had been about 7,000. The lie, though, never made it into her piece. Why bother to spend the time and column space to correct a silly exaggeration, when this same man has said he might want to summarily execute enemy combatants and defile their bodies? You need to pick your battles. ""We used to fact-check everything, every day,"" another reporter told me, ""but it gets hard to keep up."" For a writer filing on deadline an hour after a rally ends, there's not enough time to thoroughly fact-check the dozens of fabrications that spilled from the stage. It's also hard to know who the fact-checking is for. At this point, anyone who hates Trump has ample evidence he's a liar. And anyone who loves Trump doesn't care. * * * The more time I spent with the Trump press pack, the more sympathy I had for them. They display equanimity in the face of outrageous behavior. They display physical courage in the face of near rumbles. Perhaps I'm a fragile soul--Trump would no doubt come up with a snappy epithet to encapsulate my wuss-itude--but I'm not sure that I could handle the emotional rigors of their workplace. The Thunderdome vibe at Trump events set my teeth on edge. Each time the mood tautened, I'd wonder: Is this the day a truly tragic thing happens? I found it unsettling that the loudest cheers at these rallies--the moments when the crowd would unleash pure glee and actual fist pumps--came when Trump would direct his security team to eject a protester by shouting, ""OK, get him out!"" The press isn't allowed to exit or enter the designated pen while the rallies are happening, which means you can either stay inside to get separation from the crowds (and a usable workspace) or stay outside to get close-up footage of altercations happening amid the throngs (unless, as in the case of a Sun-Sentinel reporter, you're threatened with arrest for doing so). I also could not abide large, repeated doses of in-person Trump. It infuriated me when he'd pause between telling blatant whoppers to point at the media pen and say, ""Those are very dishonest people, I have to tell you."" On cue, his minions would spin around and boo us. Sometimes, he gets personal with the press. At one rally, Trump referred to NBC News reporter Katy Tur as ""little Katy, third-rate journalist"" while she was in the pen, surrounded by his riled-up groupies. In February, Tur tweeted about another special moment on the trail: ""Sometimes we get tense,"" another journalist told me. ""I'm surprised there hasn't been an incident of someone throwing a blunt object and hitting a reporter in the head. I wouldn't be shocked if it happened."" The longtime Trump embeds are a close-knit group. They gossip and commiserate. After Deb's arrest, there was a flurry of texts coordinating ways to help, checking on the latest updates. They have to remind themselves not to get inured to their surroundings. Things that a year ago might have seemed monumentally loony, or off-the-charts unacceptable, now barely raise an eyebrow. ""I think we need troop rotations for the embedded reporters,"" suggested one writer. ""You need a fresh set of eyes to say, 'I can't believe what I just saw.' "" Despite the heavy adjectives getting thrown around--fascist, demagogue, authoritarian--the beat reporters I spoke to mostly felt they couldn't use that kind of language. Opinion writers, sure. But straight news journalists felt the best they could do was catalog the madness and let the American citizenry decide. Some writers objected to the idea that they were giving Trump too much coverage--after all, he's the GOP front-runner, and this campaign is something we've never seen before. At least one writer did, however, feel the situation was different when it comes to cable news, where Trump's thirst for airtime and the networks' thirst for ratings can profoundly skew the calculus. As the Trump campaign has accrued power, its treatment of the media has grown ever more worrisome. Reporters told me that Trump is incredibly attuned to his coverage in a way that other presidential candidates aren't. The campaign will sometimes single out specific outlets for vindictive treatment. The Des Moines Register, the New York Times, BuzzFeed, and Univision were all denied access to Trump events in the wake of running negative coverage. Both the National Press Club and the White House Correspondents' Association have already felt compelled to fire their first meek shots over Trump's bow. Trump's campaign manager, former New Hampshire state police officer Corey Lewandowski, was recently accused of physically accosting a female Breitbart reporter. Whatever the severity of the manhandling, the campaign's response in the aftermath has been, to use a favorite Trump word, ""disgusting."" Despite photographic evidence and an immediate eyewitness report from a trustworthy Washington Post writer, the campaign continues to deny that the incident ever happened. Hicks attacked the Breitbart reporter's integrity, releasing a statement including this line: ""We leave to others whether this is part of a larger pattern of exaggerating incidents, but on multiple occasions she has become part of the news story as opposed to reporting it."" Lewandowski tweeted that the Breitbart reporter was ""delusional."" There's no shame, no accountability, no decency. ""Trump surrounds himself with a bunch of dicks,"" shrugged one writer, referring to Lewandowski, and other reporters I spoke to tended to agree. On Saturday, Lewandowski was again caught getting rough on camera, this time with a protester in Arizona, and again the campaign denied it despite visual evidence. A couple of journalists on the Trump beat were already beginning to express concern about how the media might fare under a Trump presidency, if he should win. The previous two presidents have been imperfect in their treatment of the press--both Bush and Obama closed ranks and tightened access in ways that previous administrations hadn't--but basic norms pertained. Would Trump honor quaint traditions regarding White House press coverage? No one knows. ""It's occurring to me that it's a really fucking slippery slope,"" said one reporter. ""I've been assuming the White House Correspondents' Association would negotiate for traditional access and protocols. But I'm applying a rational schema to this. What's to prevent Donald Trump from just getting rid of the WHCA? Trump doesn't let the press pack on his plane now, something that other candidates all do. Would President Trump let reporters on Air Force One?"" Campaigns can provide a window into how an administration will be run. The vast machinery of American governance might in many ways keep an outlandish President Trump in check. But there's not much to prevent Trump's White House press shop from resembling his press shop now: capricious, inscrutable, vindictive, insulated. I'm imagining President Trump communicating solely via tweets and phone-ins to cable news shows. I'm imagining the New York Times--a paper that Trump says ""allows dishonest reporters to totally fabricate stories""--getting barred on a whim from the White House briefing room. I'm imagining journalists emailing policy questions to press secretary Hope Hicks and receiving no response. (Hicks did not respond to emailed questions for this story.) * * * On Tuesday night, as the primary returns rolled in, reporters flocked to the luxurious confines of Mar-a-Lago, Trump's personal residence in Palm Beach, Florida. Some of us had dressed more formally than out on the trail, to match the surroundings. The balmy, scented air wafted over us as we strolled across the lawns and proceeded through the Secret Service security check at the door. Once inside, we mingled beneath the gaudy chandeliers of the enormous Donald J. Trump Ballroom, waiting for the man to appear. As we were enjoying Mr. Trump's hospitality, another reporter was being turned away at the Mar-a-Lago gates. Politico writer Ben Schreckinger had been previously approved for credentials, only to have them revoked after he wrote a negative piece about Lewandowski. He was told to leave the grounds. Later that evening, Trump would call Schreckinger ""a dishonest, third-rate reporter with a failing outlet that will soon be out of business, hopefully."" Sopan Deb had made it past the door. He was sporting a new abrasion beneath his chin, where he'd made contact with Chicago pavement four days before. The police would later drop the charges against him, and he seemed to be taking the whole thing in stride. But getting arrested wasn't even the first unfortunate personal incident Deb had endured while on the Trump trail. At a January rally in Reno, Nevada, a Trump supporter asked Deb if he was taking pictures for ISIS (adding, ""Yeah, I'm talking to you"" when Deb looked at him in shock). I asked him if, given the unique nature of this campaign and his experiences covering it, he feels any special responsibility to raise alarms in his work. ""All I can do is my job,"" he said. ""Whether my reporting makes any difference is out of my control."" Trump had taken questions from the press during his previous election night celebrations at Mar-a-Lago. The first time, a reporter told me, he'd seated his rich friends and Mar-a-Lago Club members in the front two rows and put the press behind them. The next time, Trump's friends had been given the front seven rows, pushing the press farther back. But Tuesday night, as Trump basked in victory, there were a full 16 rows of rich pals--500 or so elegantly dressed Palm Beach dandies--banishing reporters to the rear of the ballroom, about 40 yards away from Trump's podium. I asked my press pack friends how they were going to ask him questions from this distance. They weren't sure. They guessed they might be given microphones. One print reporter assured me she had a really big voice. It turned out not to matter. Though the event had been labeled a ""press conference,"" and we'd all obtained credentials on that basis, Trump gave a short speech--Lewandowski grinning at his side--called reporters ""disgusting,"" and then exited the room without fielding a single question. My friend with the big voice shouted, ""This is supposed to be a press conference! Aren't you going to talk to us?!"" We could hear her loud and clear. But Trump strolled past without acknowledging her. If you want a picture of a future Trump presidency, imagine a reporter shouting questions into an empty void. *Correction, March 21, 2016: This piece originally misstated that reporter Sopan Deb had been detained in jail overnight. He was detained for several hours, but not overnight. (Return.)"	"A Week on the Trail With the ""Disgusting Reporters"" Covering Donald Trump"
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/the_simple_question_the_pentagon_can_t_answer_unless_you_have_660_million.html	"The Pentagon dashed any hopes that it might soon be able to pass a simple audit, when it provided a surprisingly unhelpful response late last month to a simple question about how many widgets of a particular kind that it had in stock. Understanding the worrying significance of the Pentagon's statement that it essentially had no idea what the number is requires a bit of detail. The widget that was being asked about has a narrow purpose: It's basically a portable power station that looks like a small, plastic toolbox. Dubbed the HotPlug, it was invented to allow government investigators to transfer suspects' computers to their laboratories for forensic analysis, without first shutting the computers down. And so an Oregon-based software developer, Martin Peck, who worries about privacy issues and government secrecy, in July 2015 sent the Defense Department a Freedom of Information Act request, asking how many such devices it had in its possession. Answering this simple question, the Pentagon said, would take the department--hold your breath now--15 million labor hours. Doing so would cost--no, don't breathe yet--$660 million, the Pentagon said. While this sum is essentially chump change at the Pentagon--a bit more than one-tenth of one percent of its annual budget--in the world outside the five-sided building it's enough to buy the Washington Nationals baseball team, a 600-acre island off the coast of Australia, twelve of the most expensive Ferrari racecars, or about as much as the Pentagon is currently spending to train Iraqi soldiers in combat. Critics, including those who study modern business practices, say the reply spoke volumes about how poorly the Pentagon keeps track of its own purchasing and contracting. That issue lies at the core of persistent criticisms that the department cannot meet modern accounting standards, a circumstance that critics say opens the door widely for waste, fraud, and abuse in military expenditures. Why does the Pentagon have so much trouble determining how many specific widgets it has in its possession? In a two-page response to Peck, the department's FOIA office said Robert Jarrett, the Pentagon's director of operations, defense procurement and acquisition policy, had explained that although the Pentagon maintains a database of all its contracts--in something called the Electronic Documents Access, or EDA, system--it cannot be comprehensively searched. The Electronic Documents Access system was switched on 18 years ago after being constructed at a cost of millions of dollars, and it now includes an estimated 30 million contracts. But the FOIA officer, signing the letter to Peck on behalf of FOIA chief Stephanie L. Carr, wrote in the response: ""No method exists for a complete text search of EDA, as some documents are scans of paper copies."" The estimate that someone would need 15 million hours, or about 1,712 years, to come up with an answer--including any redactions required to keep company secrets out of the public domain--was based on the department's presumption that the person doing the searching would have to read all of the contracts and spend 20 minutes on each one. ""It makes me want to cry as a taxpayer and a citizen that DOD still doesn't have working accounting systems,"" says Rafael DeGennaro, a former congressional staff member who now directs the nonprofit Audit the Pentagon initiative, which presses for legislation to force better accounting of how the military spends its $580 billion annual budget. ""They need this information to manage the place, and they need this information to justify the burden of taxes we pay into the black box that is Pentagon accounting."" It's not the first time that the Pentagon's inability to say what it's got in its possession has been under a spotlight. It's clear--even to top Pentagon officials--that one consequence is that a lot of money gets wasted buying things the Pentagon does not actually need to buy. Because the Pentagon did not know how many spare parts it already had for a military transport airplane, called the C-130, it spent $6.6 million between July 2012 and June 2014 on parts that it did not need, according to a June 2015 Department of Defense Inspector General's report. Similarly, partly because the Pentagon didn't know how many useful spare parts it had on hand for its V-22 Osprey military hybrid aircraft, it spent $8.7 million between August 2014 and May 2015 on parts it did not need, according to a separate Inspector General report.* It predicted that storing those extra parts would cost $700,000 over the next five years. Paul Bracken, a professor of management at Yale University, said in an interview that nearly all successful organizations have searchable parts databases. ""All businesses keep meticulous control of inventory, what the product is, what it costs, how long it's been on the shelf,"" he said. ""A private corporation would have that information literally at their fingertips because they have relational databases to store it all. A relational database means you can search by any criteria you want."" A 1990 law requires federal agencies to pass an annual audit, which requires among other things that they be able to account for all their possessions. But the Pentagon has never complied--it is the sole outlier, responsible for roughly half of all federal discretionary spending--and its deadline for passing such an audit keeps extending. When Peck made a similar FOIA request to the Drug Enforcement Agency, for example, asking how many Harris Kingfish systems it had bought to track phone calls, the DEA replied within a month that it had two. A press spokeswoman for the DEA, Barbara Carreno, said in an emailed statement that the agency uses a Department of Justice database called the Unified Financial Management System to track ""contracts and accountable property."" The database does have a search function. Presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders don't agree on much, but bringing the Pentagon's self-awareness up to modern accounting standards is one topic they both feel is urgent. A bill they have co-sponsored with six other senators would impose a series of graduated punishments if the Pentagon fails to pass an audit soon. These punishments include changing financial management positions if the department fails to pass an audit for fiscal year 2016 and blocking the Defense Department from upgrading or acquiring certain new weapons if it fails to obtain an audit for fiscal year 2017. The bill has been referred to a committee, but no hearing about it has been scheduled. This story was published by the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative news organization in Washington, D.C.

28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/03/merrick_garland_is_obama_s_rope_a_dope_nominee.html	"Merrick Garland, the appellate chief judge whom President Obama has nominated to the Supreme Court, is not going to become a Supreme Court justice before the election or probably ever. One imagines that both he and Obama are aware of this. He is a prop, chosen to spend the next eight months as a prop. The proof is in the basic description: Garland is a 63-year-old white man with a centrist inclination. If Obama were selecting a Supreme Court justice whom he genuinely expected to be confirmed, Garland's nomination would constitute political malpractice. He is too old, too unreliable, too much a creature of the statist center, and he brings no diversity to the bench. No offense to him, of course. But he knows this, and he knows that his nomination exists largely as a political lever against Republicans. He is someone about whom Senate Republicans have said nice things in the past, and his selection allows Democrats to wield those statements against Republicans as evidence of hypocrisy. Obama ""could easily name Merrick Garland, who is a fine man,"" Sen. Orrin Hatch said in a recent Newsmax interview, to give just one example. ""He probably won't do that because this appointment is about the election. So I'm pretty sure he'll name someone the [liberal Democratic base] wants."" It will be genuinely amusing for the remainder of the year to watch Hatch defend himself against this and other quotes as he refuses to consider Garland's nomination. Hatch had a point about how Garland is not, however, a great pick to rally the liberal Democratic base. This points to the quandary Obama was facing in selecting his prop nominee: Should he pick a boring centrist whom Republicans would tie themselves into knots trying to portray as unacceptably left-wing or a younger, nonwhite, perhaps female rising star around whom the Democratic base could rally? He chose the former. Though Garland's selection may make Republicans look especially foolish in their obstructionism, Democratic interest groups won't be all that exercised by Republican obstruction in this instance. The National Organization for Women, for example, released one of the first statements following Garland's nomination. It referred to Garland a ""real nowhere man"" on issues of women's rights. What Garland does--and he should be commended for doing it--is take the bullet for whichever candidates-in-waiting Democrats really hope to get on the Supreme Court one day, whether that's Sri Srinivasan, Paul Watford, Jane Kelly, or whoever. Had any of those candidates been nominated, Republicans would have deemed them radically liberal from the start and drawn the bad-faith argument backward from there, just as they're going to attempt with Garland now. Their names would have been shot by the time would-be President Hillary Clinton got to make a nomination for real. (Clinton could, of course, re-nominate Garland in 2017, but she would likely want her own pick--and Republicans will have made Garland toxic to themselves by then.) We can reasonably ascertain that those nominees-in-waiting are privately thankful not to have been selected. If Garland is mostly a player in Obama's rope-a-dope strategy, though, that itself represents an interesting shift in Obama's thinking from his first term to his second. Garland was not always considered as a prop. In 2010, following Justice John Paul Stevens' retirement, Garland was on Obama's shortlist for the position that ultimately went to Justice Elena Kagan. Neither Garland nor Kagan was a candidate about whom liberals were all too thrilled. They were products of the Obama administration's first-term, reach-across-the-aisle thinking that liberals considered excruciatingly naive. Obama would go out of his way making overtures to Republicans for a bipartisan consensus that was never coming. Kagan and Garland were perfect manifestations of that. Six years later, Obama has been disabused of those instincts. We don't want to get too cynical: Obama surely believes that Garland is a good man and a perfectly qualified judge who by any measure would constitute a stark improvement over Justice Antonin Scalia; the president and his nominee seem to share certain heterodoxies from the left on matters related to civil liberties. But Obama is not so ungrounded as to believe that Garland will end up in Scalia's chair or that Republicans will see the light and confirm him before his tenure ends. A centrist like Garland was someone that first-term Obama thought might earn Republicans' respect. Now he is someone that second-term Obama knows will earn their irrational enmity.

Republicans have 358 delegates up for grabs across fives states, and two of them, Florida and Ohio, are winner-take-all. Front-runner Donald Trump leads in polls in all but Ohio, where he and John Kasich are virtually tied. A Trump victory in Florida could prove a fatal blow to Marco Rubio's campaign. Meanwhile, Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are vying for 792 delegates across the same states. Clinton has cozy leads in Florida, Ohio, and North Carolina, but she's tied with Sanders in Illinois and Missouri. Will Bernie Sanders surprise the country with another huge upset like the one he pulled off in Michigan earlier this month? Pundits and politicos will be watching closely to find out.
