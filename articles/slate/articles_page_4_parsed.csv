While his odds have been deteriorating steadily since his disastrous performance in the first presidential debate, Friday's bombshell recording of him casually ""joking"" about groping women during a private conversation that was picked up by a hot mic in 2005 has almost certainly cooked the Republican nominee's goose. Still: While it seems extraordinarily unlikely that Trump will become the most powerful person in the world, he can continue to do an unprecedented amount of damage to our democracy, and he could turn Sunday night's second presidential debate into a spectacle the likes of which modern American politics has never seen. If he responds to questions about his own allegedly abusive sexual history by going after Bill Clinton--as he did when he was first approached about the groping recording--then our presidential cycle could devolve to a new low. As always, pundits and politicos will be watching closely. Below are their live tweets, drawn from a list of top accounts curated by Slate. Those who lean left are on the left; those who lean right are on the right. Enjoy the instant spin. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."	What Twitter's Smartest Liberals and Conservatives Are Saying About the Second Debate	['Trump']	[]
1	1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/why_mormons_led_the_revolt_against_donald_trump.html	"The latest Dump Trump movement may have gone national, but ground zero was Utah. Rep. Jason Chaffetz and the state's current governor, Gary Herbert, were among the first to pull their tepid endorsements of Trump in the wake of the ""grab them by the pussy"" videotape leak.* Sen. Mike Lee, who had refused to back Trump, along with former Utah governor and onetime presidential candidate Jon Huntsman Jr., who had endorsed Trump, both called on their party's presidential nominee to drop out. Rep. Mia Love, who never backed Trump, also urged him to ""step aside,"" while for now Sen. Orrin Hatch and Rep. Rob Bishop still support Trump. Elsewhere in the Latter-day Saints diaspora, Idaho's Mike Crapo, a Mormon, was the first Republican senator to withdraw his endorsement. As I've written before, Trump's much-discussed ""Mormon problem"" is largely rooted in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' past as a persecuted religious community and its present as a church with a growing international--especially Mexican--membership. Mormon politicians, and to a certain extent the Mormon people writ large, have been turned off by Trump's political platform built on scapegoating Muslims and Mexicans. Earlier this year one poll indicated that Utah--home to the GOP's most consistent voting bloc--might actually be a swing state. But since the summer, polls showed Utah's electorate reverting to the mean and rejoining evangelical Christian ""cultural war"" voters to back Trump, if only reluctantly. As Mormon historian Benjamin Park explained to me, ""Mormonism's attachment to the Republican Party has largely been centered on the conservative values of the religious right."" As long as Trump (and his running mate, Mike Pence) paid lip service to protecting religious liberty and opposing abortion, ""They could mostly escape censure on more questionable opinions"" on immigrants and minorities. Yet on Friday, the swift and definitive Mormon defection from Trump reflected an even more intimate (and particularly male) Mormon impulse than to care for the religious and racial ""other""--it was the urge to honor and protect Mormon wives, mothers, and daughters. Chaffetz announced that he could no longer back Trump because he and his wife ""have a 15-year old daughter, and if I can't look her in the eye and tell her these things, I can't endorse this person."" Likewise, Mitt Romney, the leading Mormon Never Trumper, tweeted, ""Hitting on married women? Condoning assault? Such vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America's face to the world."" On Saturday, even the Mormon-owned Deseret News broke with an 80-year tradition of not entering ""the troubled waters of presidential endorsement"" and called on Trump ""to step down from his pursuit of the American presidency."" Trump is unfit for the highest office in the land, the paper explained, because he used his power to sexually abuse women and did so while also espousing the belief that these women actually wanted it. To be sure, there is something gallant about these Mormon men coming to the defense of women and girls everywhere. Yet it would be wrong to read these denunciations of Trump as simple and laudable acts of chivalry. They are also rooted in a Mormon culture of patriarchy, which prescribes strict gender roles in the Mormon church and in the Mormon home. In the LDS Church, only men are ordained to the lay priesthood. This means that starting at the age of 12, Mormon boys outrank their mothers and older sisters in church. By speaking out now against Trump's misogyny, Mormon politicians who had previously backed Trump are unintentionally highlighting how they had previously silenced the very women they claim to be protecting. As Kate Kelly, who was excommunicated from the LDS Church because of her leadership in the Ordain Women movement, explained to me, ""The male-only priesthood structure in the LDS Church conditions Mormons not to actually believe the words of the multiplicity of women who have already come out to denounce the Republican nominee as a predator."" Testimonies from the women Trump abused weren't authoritative enough. (Earlier this week, the Associated Press published details from Trump's Apprentice days of the real estate mogul allegedly demanding that female contestants show more cleavage, twirl for his amusement and inspection, and endure talk about which contestant he'd like to bed.) ""These Mormon leaders had to hear a recording of Trump's own voice confessing his vulgar personality and acts before they turned against him,"" Kelly said. To see the pernicious results of this culture in which male voices are valued over female voices, one need only look at the recent spate of stories of female students at the Mormon-owned Brigham Young University who sought support from the school after being sexually assaulted, only to be disciplined for breaking the school's ""honor code"" against premarital sex and alcohol use. And relatedly, one need only look at the case of Elizabeth Smart to see how the Mormon culture of sexual modesty creates a particularly strong ""Madonna-whore"" complex. After being abducted at the age of 14 from her Salt Lake City home, Smart was raped almost daily during her nine months in captivity. Smart, now an advocate for sexual abuse victims, has explained that despite having many chances to run away, she remained with her captures. Her abstinence-only Mormon upbringing taught her that because she had already had sex, no future husband would want her. She remembered a schoolteacher comparing girls who engage in premarital sex to a used piece of chewing gum. ""Oh, my gosh, I'm that chewed up piece of gum,"" Smart explained in 2013 at conference on human trafficking at Johns Hopkins University. She recalled thinking: ""Why would it even make a difference if you are rescued? Your life has no value."" Of course, like the Mormons, conservative American evangelicals advocate for upholding strict gender roles, abstinence before marriage, and traditional marriage. But prominent evangelicals, including ""value vote"" leaders Ralph Reed and Tony Perkins, are sticking with Trump, even after these recent revelations. They have even framed Trump's character failings in biblical terms. King David was a sinner who committed adultery and murder, Franklin Graham told to a group of evangelicals gathered last June to reassure them that a Trump presidency was in their best voting interest. After all, the Supreme Court, the sanctity of the border, and the safety of the American streets from the predations of Black Lives Matter rioters and Islamic terrorists all hang in the balance. By wedding themselves to Trump, these evangelicals risk reducing American conservative evangelicalism to white, populist nationalism. But this also presents an opportunity for the Mormons. By rejecting Trumpism, the Mormons, whose religion the Republican Party was founded in part to destroy, have begun to replace white evangelicals as the self-anointed defenders of Republican ""American"" values. In 2016, Utah has become a symbol for America, something that Donald Trump seems to intuitively understand. This is why his failure to win support in that reddest of red states has bothered him so much. Hillary Clinton, who in August set up a campaign office in Salt Lake City, also understands Utah's newfound symbolism. And it's increasingly possible that, with a four-way split of the vote among Clinton; Trump; Libertarian Gary Johnson; and Evan McMullin, the BYU grad, former CIA agent, and devout Mormon who presents himself as the true conservative alternative to Trump, Utah just might turn blue in 2016. More plausible is that, with much of the rest of the Republican establishment tainted by its support for Trump, Mormon Republicans of Utah will be called upon to rebuild their party.

2	2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/the_horror_is_everything_the_gop_could_tolerate_about_trump.html	"On Friday, Donald Trump said two things that should disqualify him from the presidency, if not American public life in general. The second one, you know. The first, you probably didn't hear. How Republicans have responded to the two statements tells you everything you need to know about how the GOP conjured a creature like Trump. Hours before we learned of Trump's boasts about grabbing women ""by the pussy,"" the Republican nominee affirmed his false belief that the Central Park 5--five teenagers, four of them black and one Latino, convicted on charges of attacking and raping a 28-year-old white woman, all five since exonerated by DNA evidence--were guilty.* ""They admitted they were guilty,"" Trump said. ""The police doing the original investigation say they were guilty. The fact that that case was settled with so much evidence against them is outrageous. And the woman, so badly injured, will never be the same."" The same Republican leaders who rushed to condemn Trump for his remarks on a hot mic were silent about his continued attacks on these men, which stretch back to the original event in 1989, when he placed an incendiary ad in New York City newspapers against the then-teenagers. ""Bring back the death penalty. Bring back our police!"" said Trump. ""[M]uggers and murderers ... should be forced to suffer and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes. They must serve as examples so that others will think long and hard before committing a crime or an act of violence."" Republicans didn't say anything because Trump wasn't attacking Republicans. The ground didn't shift for the GOP nominee until he did. His ""grab them by the pussy"" comments don't just threaten his own bid at the White House; they threaten the whole Republican political apparatus. They undermine party enthusiasm. They give millions of Republican-voting women a reason to stay home. And what happens if they do? Suddenly, the House and Senate are at risk. Suddenly, Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell are leaders of a minority party. But of course the GOP could tolerate his place at the top of the ticket so long as he restricted his threats to groups outside the party. President Trump, after all, would nominate their judges, sign their tax cuts, and affirm their plans to gut the social safety net. Ryan, the House speaker, said as much in his endorsement. ""For me, it's a question of how to move ahead on the ideas that I--and my House colleagues--have invested so much in through the years,"" he wrote in June. ""It's not just a choice of two people, but of two visions for America. And House Republicans are helping shape that Republican vision by offering a bold policy agenda, by offering a better way ahead. Donald Trump can help us make it a reality."" For him and many Republicans, Trump's frank advocacy of racial repression is a small price to pay for their expansive reversal of liberal social policy. It's hardly even a price. In fact, we now have a list of all the things the Republican Party will tolerate solely for the sake of the White House and a continued congressional majority. It's a long list. The Republican Party will tolerate racist condemnation of Mexican immigrants and Latino Americans at large. It will tolerate the same racist condemnation of Muslims, even as both attacks feed an atmosphere of paranoia, distrust, and violence. It will tolerate a policy platform that treats these groups--and Syrian refugees to the United States--as a dangerous fifth column. In Trump's vision of America, Latino immigrants, when they aren't ""stealing jobs,"" are the vector for crime and disorder, plunging towns and cities into lawlessness. It's why Trump wants to root them out with a new ""deportation force,"" home by home, person by person. And it's why he wants a wall on the Mexican border--a concrete prophylactic to keep those dark-skinned migrants from reaching our borders. It will tolerate the same racist policies for Muslim Americans. In Trump's world, Muslims are a ""Trojan horse,"" a foreign intrusion that threatens American security. It's why he wants to ban their entry to the country, why he wants new surveillance of Muslim communities, why he wants to reject refugees, and why he's accused Muslim Americans of condoning terrorist violence. ""They know what's going on,"" Trump said after a shooter killed 49 people at a nightclub in Orlando. ""They know that he was bad. They knew the people in San Bernardino were bad. But you know what? They didn't turn them in. And you know what? We had death, and destruction."" The Republican Party and its leaders--Reince Priebus, Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, and hundreds of federal and state office-holders--will tolerate attacks on veterans and prisoners of war. It will tolerate blatant racism toward a federal judge and a Gold Star family, whose son died fighting for this country. It will tolerate Trump's call for war crimes (""take their oil""), his zeal for torture, and his support for renewed nuclear proliferation. It will tolerate his rhetoric toward black Americans, treating them as helpless brutes leading disordered, degenerate lives. It will even tolerate his drive to make the Republican Party a more comfortable home for white nationalists, a vehicle for ethno-nationalism and herrenvolk democracy. Ryan, praised for his principle and integrity, said nothing when Trump hired Steve Bannon to coordinate his campaign, despite Bannon's ties to white nationalists through his website, Breitbart. He said nothing when Trump promised to deport American citizens whose parents came to the country illegally, a violation of the 14th Amendment. And even when Ryan condemned Trump--as in the case of Trump's attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel and the Khan family--he still backed him for president of the United States. For more than a year, Trump has preached state repression of nonwhites. And for more than a year, Republican leaders have tip-toed around him, even praised him. They've defended him, rallied behind him, and touted him as the right man to lead the country. ""Donald Trump is committed to cut taxes, curb spending, and get our national debt under control,"" said Florida Sen. Marco Rubio in his video endorsement of Trump at the Republican National Convention in July. ""Unlike Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump takes seriously the threats from Islamic radicals and is committed to rebuilding our military."" Rubio joined the recent chorus against Trump, even as he continues to back the real estate mogul's bid for the White House. There's a logic here, and it's not hard to see. When it comes to voting, it doesn't matter to Republicans that Trump is anathema to nonwhites and religious minorities. Neither black Americans nor Latinos nor Muslim Americans are going to vote for the GOP in significant numbers, and the party as a result is unresponsive to those communities, if not openly contemptuous of their concerns. Few Republicans, for example, want to restore the Voting Rights Act, and even fewer have challenged the drive to restrict and disenfranchise voters. We can see this dynamic in real time. That's why they distance and condemn. That's why they place a wall between themselves and their nominee, hoping no one notices their endorsements and continued support. Anything to protect their congressional majorities from anger and disenchantment. ""Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified. I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests,"" Ryan said in a statement. ""No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever,"" said Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus. ""As the father of three daughters, I strongly believe that Trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full responsibility for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his comments on that tape,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. These are strong statements, but they fall flat. Ryan and Priebus and McConnell all still think Trump should be president. Of Republicans who attacked Trump after the leak, just a handful have withdrawn their endorsements, distancing themselves from their party's nominee. ""I'm out. I can no longer in good conscience endorse this person for president. It is some of the most abhorrent and offensive comments that you can possibly imagine,"" said Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz. His governor, Gary Herbert, had a similar take. ""Donald Trump's statements are beyond offensive & despicable,"" he said on Twitter. ""While I cannot vote for Hillary Clinton, I will not vote for Trump."" For all the press they attract, however, their condemnations don't hide the facts of the matter. Those are still plain to see. For the last year, through Donald Trump, Republicans have shown what they can live with. And what they can live with is a nominee whose chief appeal is his overt, unapologetic racism, and whose plans would remake America into a whites-only country, with suspicion and hostility for those on the other side of the color divide.

3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/our_degrading_election_gets_the_catchphrase_it_deserves.html	"Earlier this week, Donald Trump tried to explain away his long history of outrageously misogynist comments by saying, ""A lot of that was done for the purpose of entertainment."" It was obvious at the time that this was not true, and now we have conclusive proof. The Washington Post's indefatigable David Fahrenthold has obtained a 2005 recording of Trump talking about women with Access Hollywood's Billy Bush on a hot mic. In it, he boasts of how, when he sees a beautiful woman, he likes to start kissing her without preliminaries. ""I don't even wait,"" Trump, said, as Bush eggs him on. ""And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy."" This is how Trump talks privately, which is at once shocking and entirely unsurprising. In an election in which no individual outrage seems to matter, it's possible that this one might. It's not just that we have further evidence of what sort of person Trump is. Trump's words sounded an awful lot like cavalier boasts about sexual assault. They're particularly disturbing when you consider that Jill Harth, the makeup artist who accused Trump of attempted rape in a 1997 lawsuit, said that Trump grabbed her sexually. Ivanka Trump defended her father by insisting that the man she knows is ""not a groper."" Now we know that Trump himself says otherwise. It is thus not just legitimate but imperative that journalists ask Trump what he meant by ""Grab them by the pussy."" Luckily, there is a debate on Sunday. The exchange is relevant to the debate in other ways as well. Ever since his disgraceful performance in his last faceoff with Clinton, Trump and his surrogates have been threatening to bring up Bill Clinton's affairs. If he does, Hillary Clinton has every reason to discuss Trump's unapologetic talk about pursuing a married woman. ""I did try and fuck her,"" Trump said on the Bush tape. (It's not clear whom he was talking about, and if the attempted fucking was before or after his 2005 marriage to Melania Trump.) ""She was married,"" he continued. ""I moved on her very heavily. ... I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn't get there. ... Then all of a sudden I see her, she's now got the big phony tits and everything."" It's worth noting that Harth also described Trump pursuing her relentlessly even though she had a boyfriend, George Houraney. In her lawsuit, she quotes Trump demanding that she ""cheat on George."" Indeed, the man she describes in that suit sounds a lot like the man on the Billy Bush recording. Her story becomes more credible when we have Trump himself on tape describing his M.O. We might come to remember ""Grab them by the pussy"" as an analogue to Mitt Romney's 47 percent speech. If so, it will be an appropriate catchphrase for the most degrading election in American history. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

4	4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/why_town_halls_are_better.html	"It did not take moderator Elaine Quijano long to lose control of Tuesday night's vice presidential debate. It began right off the bat, really, when she asked Sen. Tim Kaine, ""What about your qualities, your skills, and your temperament equip you to step into that role at a moment's notice?"" and he responded with a memorized opening speech. Not long after Mike Pence began answering questions, Kaine was annoyingly interrupting him, and Pence, whenever he got a free minute to speak, was whistling past Donald Trump's 16 months of embarrassing and offensive comments. Controlling a situation in which debaters are determined to just yammer out their oppo for 90 minutes is never easy--especially in a country where the news media has a worse net approval rating than even Trump. Ignoring some slick moderator's diktats, if not outright insulting the moderator, is a means of proving oneself in touch with the electorate. Yet in doing so, they give the electorate a crappy, disorderly argument about nothing. What's the best way to get out of this quandary and to have a comprehensible discussion that allows the country to press forward with some shred of dignity? You can't just get rid of the moderators entirely. A pure state of nature is still worse than playground restlessness. What you can do is just allow the moderator to serve as a direct pass-through for the questions of ordinary people, whose concerns the candidates will be less eager to blow off. Sunday's town hall debate in St. Louis is the last best opportunity in this horrifically dumb election to foster a meaningful conversation between the two candidates, at least to the extent that meaningful conversation could ever be had between one person who is not Trump and one person who is. The format transfers power from a necessarily ineffectual moderator to those are known in campaignese as ""average people,"" or human voters. Having average people do the asking alleviates the problem of candidates hearing the questions and then just saying whatever they want. They will have to address the person's question or look like a jerk in front of 50 million-plus viewers. Having average people ask the questions also allows those people to relate personal stories about problems that they're facing. The news anchors who moderate and select the questions are cossetted from the country's economic problems. They are rich people. If news anchors were to tap into the problems they're facing in today's fierce economy, we would hear about shiftless Park Avenue doormen and the like. So when they try to channel the economic concerns of average people, we get questions, like, I don't know ... Quijano: Sen. Kaine, on the issue of Social Security, in 18 years, when the Social Security trust funds run out of money, you'll be 76. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates your benefits could be cut by as much as $7,500 per year. What would your administration do to prevent this cut? The framing here is that of a deficit scold--Social Security's not going to be around anymore! Boogity boogity boo!--that implies the program is doomed. It directly cites a Pete Peterson operation! It is the sort of question one asks when one wants to appear savvy about politics. It's right out of the Serious Adult Beltway Debate starter kit. Now let's consider another hypothetical Social Security question that a moderator might ask: ""Do you support expanding, and not cutting, Social Security's modest benefits?"" This is not my question. It is the question submitted by Ellen P. from North Carolina, who submitted it at the Presidential Open Questions forum. This site, put forth by the bipartisan Open Debate Coalition, allows people to submit their own questions, have them voted on, and vote on others; they'll be submitted to debate moderators Martha Raddatz and Anderson Cooper, who have said they'll consider using them on Sunday. As of 11 a.m. Friday, Ellen P.'s question was the third most popular on the site out of 12,226 submissions, with more than 35,000 votes since it was submitted on Sept. 28. If you look at the related popular questions that were ""merged"" into this, most ask about restoring cost-of-living increases and lifting the cap on Federal Insurance Contributions Act. They take as a given, in ways that network moderators' questions typically don't, the notion that maintaining and perhaps enhancing Social Security is necessary in this precarious economy. ""I have paid into Social Security for over 40 years and my son has paid in for 25 years and will continue to pay,"" Susie C. from Texas asks in a related question that's garnered more than 27,560 votes. ""How are you going to keep our money safe for all people that have contributed?"" It's personal narratives like that that turn something like Social Security from an accounting issue to a moral question that's harder to dodge--or harder, still, to convert into a cheap, unrelated #slam on your opponent. Consider the No. 1 question on the forum. ""Would you support requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales?"" Richard M. from California asks. ""My son was murdered by someone who should have never had a gun. Gaps in our current system make it easy for felons & other dangerous people to buy guns online & at gun shows, no questions asked."" I have a hard time seeing Hillary Clinton convert that one into one of her awful zingers against Trump or Trump leaping from that into a line about how Bill Clinton did sex things with Gennifer Flowers and Monica Lewinsky. The first two debates have gone off the rails because they reflect the spectacle of what politicos call ""the process"": isolated, detached, surreal, overproduced, overcaffeinated, and hollow. The town hall, done right, allows voters to grab this bizarre process from the parallel plane on which it's been conducted and return it for a moment to something like reality.

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/implicit_bias_is_real_don_t_be_so_defensive_mike_pence.html	"Dear white people: We need to have a talk. We need to discuss something that keeps coming up in this year's presidential and vice presidential debates: implicit bias. On Tuesday night, Mike Pence took offense at the whole idea. He framed it as an attack on the integrity of police officers and white people in general. That's a natural reaction, but it's a mistake. And it perpetuates the problem. Every day, in one city or another, black and brown parents sit their kids down and talk to them about bias. They explain that at some point, based on the color of your skin, you might be suspected of doing something wrong. Don't go to certain places, don't wear certain clothes, and don't move in any way that might be construed as a threat. Play it safe. White people don't have to talk to our kids this way, because our color doesn't attract suspicion. We need to have a different talk, not about suffering implicit bias but about practicing it. Here's the first ground rule: ""Implicit bias"" isn't an accusation. It doesn't mean you're bad. It means you're normal. Animals prejudge one another based on appearance. Human beings are naturally tribal. So implicit bias, as a disposition, isn't something you learn. It's something you learn to overcome. Here's the second rule: When somebody brings up implicit bias, don't freak out. Don't get defensive and shut down the discussion. This has happened twice in the past nine days. It started in the first presidential debate, when moderator Lester Holt quoted remarks by Hillary Clinton and asked her: ""Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people?"" Clinton answered him this way:"	Implicit Bias Is Real. Don't Be So Defensive.	['Pence', 'Clinton']	[]
6	6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/mike_pence_did_his_job.html	"Zingers: End them. If there was one response that seemed to really speak to the however many millions of people who were watching the vice presidential debate, presumably because of a lost bet, it was Mike Pence's, mocking Tim Kaine for his ""pre-done"" lines. Because, to the misfortune of the West, Kaine and his preppers did appear to think that ""lines"" would be a wise tactic to employ--again. Just as Hillary Clinton, in her poor first segment of last week's debate, used ""Trumped-up trickle down,"" Kaine inexplicably had his own: referring to Pence as Trump's ""apprentice""--just like the teevee show!--and an unclever contrast between Trump as the ""you're fired"" president and Clinton as the ""you're hired"" president. God, stop. Interruptions also didn't suit Kaine. Though he would calm down as the night wore on, the tenor of the debate was something of an inverse of the first Trump-Clinton matchup: The Democrat seemed less in control of himself, while the Republican was an immoveable object. There was no need for so many interruptions; Kaine came across as overeager where he didn't need to be. He's not a rude person in real life. There was no need to play one on television. Like Clinton, Kaine's best points came when speaking in paragraphs and responding to the paragraphs of others. He made a strong point about Pence's record in support of Social Security privatization, to which Pence's best response was a rehashed Reagan line. Kaine took an elegant stance on criminal justice reform and hung Trump's desire to expand ""stop-and-frisk"" around Pence's neck. Later in the debate--again, when not interrupting Pence!--he crisply delivered a cool denunciation of Trump's unseemly admiration for Vladimir Putin. Kaine's best moment, though, may have been this effort to stuff Trump's rhetoric in Pence's face and force an answer:"	Mike Pence Stabilized the GOP Ticket, at Least Until Donald Trump Gets His Phone Back	['Pence', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Kaine']	[]
7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/where_is_tim_kaine.html	"Last Wednesday morning, Sen. Tim Kaine was scheduled to hold a campaign event in Alexandria, Virginia, about a 15- or 20-minute drive from downtown Washington. This was the same Tim Kaine who is narrowly favored to win election to the second-highest office in the country in about five weeks. His debate with his Republican counterpart, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, was just six days away. I expected the Alexandria event to be mobbed with political reporters, all trying to squeeze in a question about the next mass television spectacle. I did not expect a nothingburger. I did not expect a few congressional reporters and some Virginia local media milling around a rec center for an event that had all the pomp and circumstance of an alderman's ribbon-cutting ceremony. Former Sen. John Warner, the commonwealth's longtime Republican legislator, was endorsing the Clinton-Kaine ticket; John Warner's Senate successor, Sen. Mark Warner (no relation), also came to speak. Also there was the traveling Kaine press pool, members of which--even by the standards of a traveling press pool late in an election season--looked unhappy. Kaine didn't hold any reporter gaggle at the event, and there were no opportunities to shout questions in his general direction. Maybe the rest of the media was wise to stay away. But the near-total lack of interest in Kaine's event ahead of his star turn at Tuesday's debate in Farmville, Virginia, reflected another strange dynamic in an election season that has no shortage of strange dynamics: the near-total lack of interest in Kaine at all. By the post-Palin standards of running mate selection--i.e., since the ""Do No Harm"" admonition became ""No, Goddammit, I Mean It. Do. No. Harm!""--Kaine is thus a successful pick. He is qualified. He doesn't screw up. He may help on the margins with college-educated suburban white voters, the demographic Clinton most needs to offset her losses among noncollege whites, since Tim Kaine is exactly them. Maybe he ices Virginia for the ticket; maybe Virginia was already iced. But beyond Virginia, all the positive attributes you bring to the ticket don't matter if voters never see them, or you, for that matter. Have voters seen Tim Kaine? Behold, the anti-Clinton: Unseen, unknown, Kaine arouses no strong feelings in either direction. He is the Steve Miller Band. He is NPR discussing tennis. He is the sensation produced by the drumming of one's fingers on one's desk. The HuffPollster average rates his national approval rating as relatively poor at 29.9 percent favorable to 30.3 percent unfavorable, the numerical equivalent of meh. Pence, by contrast, is viewed positively by 36.4 percent and unfavorably by 30.9 percent. What's more interesting than the net rating, though, is the difference in undecideds. Thirty-three percent of voters don't have an opinion of Pence, while 42 percent of voters don't have one of Kaine. He's just not as visible. We can understand why. The stakes are much higher for Pence, who exists now to reassure the religious right that God has a supporting presence on the ticket. His would-be boss is unqualified for the presidency, so Pence will necessarily be a stronger vice president. That means greater scrutiny and attention. There's also more interest in Pence because, well, when are vice presidential candidates most in demand from media bookers? When their respective presidential candidates screw up. In this sense Pence finds himself on cleanup duty far more often, whether it's over Trump's insults of the Khans, his temporary non-endorsements of Rep. Paul Ryan or Sen. John McCain, his refusal (until recently) to state that President Obama was born in the United States, or whatever else. Hillary Clinton is generally disliked but doesn't commit as many acute gaffes. When she does, though--i.e., following the ""basket of deplorables"" comment--that's when Kaine is the most visible. He can be effective in that role. He doesn't have to be perpetually on guard the way Clinton has during her public career; it's not going to be a world-historical event if he uses an imprecise adjective or two. He hasn't been burned enough, and until he does get burned, his lack of a national presence makes him an underutilized asset for the Clinton campaign. Kaine shares Clinton's exact brand of nonthreatening, center-left politics, but because he lacks the baked-in national distrust, he is just the ambassador the campaign needs to keep Republican leaners from congealing around Trump. Consider the line he walked in an NPR interview the week after Clinton's ""deplorables"" comment. Host Steve Inskeep asked him what he thinks about ""people around the country who aren't David Duke but are in some way anxious about the demographic change in this country? Are they racists? What do you call them?"" He gave a history of how changing demographics and social liberalization in Virginia, for example, was met with what he called a ""transitional anxiety""--reasonable fears of the unknown--but then people get over it. And like a proper centrist, he pointed out that immigration to Virginia (""One out of 9 Virginians was born in another country"") has been an economic boon: ""We went from bottom 15 per capita income to top 10. By being exclusive and keeping people out, we were hurting ourselves."" Moderate suburban voters love hearing about how changing demographics make everyone rich, whether that's the full story or not. The gains that Pence has made for his ticket are more fully realized. He was the movement conservative plucked to bring movement conservatives in line. That blunt message either got across, or it didn't. Either it has made conservatives feel comfortable casting their vote for an unqualified vulgarian who nevertheless will have some Supreme Court picks in his pocket, or it hasn't. Kaine's is a subtler message, and subtler messages don't get covered as much. He is Clinton politics without the Clinton baggage. Unless he screws up on Tuesday, the debate is the Clinton-Kaine campaign's sole opportunity to draw attention to its undercard before he disappears again.

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/trump_s_no_taxation_representation.html	"Donald Trump likes to denounce other people for not paying taxes. Four years ago, he tweeted, ""HALF of Americans don't pay income tax despite crippling govt debt."" He complained that President Obama ""only pays 20.5% on $790k salary. ... Do as I say not as I do."" Last year, Trump groused that hedge fund managers ""make a fortune, they pay no tax. It's ridiculous ... They're making a tremendous amount of money. They have to pay taxes."" Now it turns out that Trump himself may have sidestepped the IRS. Excerpts from his 1995 returns, leaked to the New York Times, show that he claimed a loss of nearly $1 billion, enough to cancel out many years of future earnings. We don't know what he paid for sure, because Trump--unlike every other major-party presidential nominee since 1980--hasn't released his returns. But the leaked documents create a presumption that for some time after 1995, as he raked in hundreds of millions of dollars, he paid no income tax. Most politicians would be embarrassed by such a disclosure. Not Trump. He and his surrogates are out in force, spinning his tax avoidance as a virtue. Here are their rationalizations. 1. It's legal. Trump and his advisers point out that the Times didn't say his write-offs were unlawful. In a Sunday morning interview on ABC's This Week, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani proclaimed: ""This man has been audited every year. Never once has a criminal charge been brought against him. Never once has he been accused of violating the law."" Well, there are those pesky suits alleging fraud and racial discrimination. But as to criminal charges, the statement is correct. It's also hypocritical. According to Trump, the government's failure to indict Hillary Clinton over her emails shows that the system is rigged. But its failure to indict Trump is vindication. 2. There's no proof he didn't pay taxes. ""All the story said was that kind of loss can be used for up to 18 years,"" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie pointed out on Fox News Sunday. ""The New York Times does not have any information in that story that says Mr. Trump did not pay taxes."" Again, this is technically true. But it's odd to hear such a lawyerly excuse from Trump's campaign, which could settle the matter by releasing his returns. 3. This justifies our refusal to release his returns. The Times article illustrates ""why releasing tax returns is so bad,"" Giuliani complained on Meet the Press. ""Somewhere around paragraph 18 they point out there was no wrongdoing. ... And that's why maybe somebody doesn't want to put out their tax returns, because somebody will distort it that way."" The leaked pages from Trump's tax returns were out of context. Therefore, Trump will continue to hide the context. 4. He paid other taxes. Giuliani claims Trump paid ""hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes: state taxes, local taxes, excise taxes."" When Chuck Todd asked how voters could be sure of this, given Trump's refusal to release his returns, Giuliani replied: ""Because if he didn't, he'd be in jail."" Trump's lack of convictions, in a criminal sense, serves as his standard of ethics. And his payment of some taxes excuses his circumvention of others. 5. Everybody does it. According to Trump's spokesmen, using loopholes to avoid taxes is a fine American tradition. ""Forty-four percent, 45 percent of America doesn't pay income tax,"" Giuliani boasted on CNN's State of the Union. That figure is down slightly from four years ago, when Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney complained that ""47 percent of Americans pay no income tax"" (which led Giuliani to agree ""that too high a percentage of Americans are not paying taxes""). Romney saw these people as freeloaders. Trump sees them as excuses for his own freeloading. 6. Trump is a genius. In their Sunday interviews, Christie and Giuliani used this word 14 times. ""The man is a genius. He knows how to operate the tax code for the benefit of the people he's serving,"" Giuliani told CNN. On ABC, the former mayor effused: ""He's a genius at how to take advantage of legal remedies that can help your company survive and grow."" Gaming the system isn't a vice. It's a talent. 7. Losses are a sign of business acumen. CNN's Jake Tapper asked Giuliani how Trump could be such a genius if he lost nearly $1 billion in a year. Giuliani explained that Tapper was naive for focusing on the loss rather than on Trump's use of the loss as a tax ploy. ""There are not very many smart businessmen who don't take advantage of the legal tax laws that are there. And if they are, then they are not very good businessmen,"" Giuliani argued. ""They don't have very good lawyers, and they don't have very good accountants."" Anyone can make money. To be great, you have to lose money and parlay the loss, through your lawyers and accountants, into a gain. 8. Failure is a step toward success. On NBC, Giuliani portrayed Trump's 1995 losses as a sign that he could turn America around. Trump ""did something we admire in America: He came back,"" said Giuliani. ""So did Steve Jobs. So did Winston Churchill. ... Great men have big failures. And then they take those failures and they turn them into great results."" If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. Unless you're Obama or Clinton, in which case you should be fired. 9. Only an abuser can fix the system. ""I know our complex tax laws better than anyone who has ever run for president and am the only one who can fix them,"" Trump tweeted in response to the Times story. As president, Trump would continue to apply his intricate knowledge of the system. He would not, however, continue to exploit that knowledge. Believe me. 10. Trump did it for others. Trump's campaign says he had ""a fiduciary responsibility to his business, his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required."" When Tapper pointed out that the document in question was Trump's personal tax return, not a corporate filing, Giuliani expanded this argument, insisting that anyone connected to Trump's finances--investors, partners, lenders--could sue him for failing to use tax loopholes. Such a failure wouldn't just be a business mistake, Giuliani argued. It would be a ""breach"" of ""fiduciary duty"" and might cost employees their jobs. Essentially, this is trickle-down altruism. No matter how self-serving Trump's chicanery was, he had to do it for the little guy. 11. To pay the taxes would have been selfish. On ABC, Giuliani said a businessman would rightly be sued by investors if he refused to exploit tax loopholes ""because it may make me look bad when I'm running for president."" Doing what's best for the country, on the grounds that you might be held publicly accountable for your conduct, is a sin. Resist that temptation, and do the right thing: take the money. 12. Trump will use his trickery for our benefit. ""You've got to figure out who you're working for,"" Giuliani told NBC. In his exploitation of tax loopholes, Trump ""was working for private interests,"" the former mayor explained. But as president, Trump would work for America. The tax story ""shows you what a genius he is,"" Giuliani told ABC. ""I want that working for me. I want to see if he can produce these kinds of results for us."" Sure, Trump played Uncle Sam for nearly $1 billion in tax breaks. But if we pay Trump a $400,000 salary, he'll be on our side. 13. Trump is a hero for promising to stop people from doing what he did. On Fox News, Christie offered ""no apologies"" for Trump's tax maneuvers. In fact, Christie said the campaign was ""taking a bow"" for Trump's having pledged to reform tax laws like those he exploited. ""Donald Trump has been the one person who, against his own personal interests, has said that he wants to change those tax laws,"" said the governor. Trump should be praised for sheltering his earnings, not condemned, because it shows how much future income he might have to give up if he reforms the tax code. 14. There's no proof that Americans pay their taxes. ""Most Americans pay their federal income taxes,"" Tapper told Giuliani. But Giuliani wasn't buying it: ""Well, I don't know. You don't know most Americans, and I don't know most Americans."" Trump withholds his returns and says you can't prove he hasn't paid up. But you don't get the same presumption of innocence. Together, these arguments paint a portrait of nihilism. In Trump's campaign, the standard of moral conduct is staying out of jail. Hypocrisy is a boast. Gamesmanship and freeloading are virtues. Capitalism is about fielding the best lawyers, not the best products. And the best way for rich people to help the poor and the middle class is to stiff the government. How much money has Trump paid in taxes? Without his returns, we can't know. But from what he and his surrogates have said since the Times story came out, we know what's in his soul and the souls of his henchmen: nothing. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	The Trump Campaign's Tax Defense Is a 14-Point Study in Nihilism	['Romney', 'Obama', 'Clinton', 'Christie', 'Trump']	[]
9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/hillary_clinton_s_reverse_sister_souljah_moment.html	"On the eve of the election, Slate's revisiting our best stories from the campaign. How did we get here? Read on. The day after the first presidential debate, all anyone wanted to talk about was the coup de grace: Alicia Machado, ""Miss Housekeeping,"" ""Where did you find this? Where did you find this?"" But the most remarkable exchange of that night had come earlier, when with a few blunt words Hillary Clinton reduced Donald Trump to peevish incoherence and, remarkably, conveyed the distance her party has traveled in the past quarter-century. If you listened carefully, you would have heard a kind of Sister Souljah moment, in reverse. It happened after moderator Lester Holt pressed Trump on his birtherism. ""Mr. Trump,"" he said, ""for five years you perpetuated a false claim of the nation's first black president was not a natural-born citizen. You questioned his legitimacy. In the last couple weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years: the president was born in the United States. Can you tell us what took you so long?"" Trump tried to shift blame, pinning birtherism on the Clinton camp and its conduct during the 2008 Democratic primary. This is false. But more interesting than Trump's answer was Clinton's response. She didn't just dismiss his claim. She pushed back in the strongest way possible. Trump ""has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen,"" Clinton said. ""There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted."" She continued, tying the birtherism to a larger critique: ""[R]emember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination, because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department. So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior."" Clinton's message was simple: From the beginning of his business career to the launch of his political one, Trump swam in a rank pool of prejudice and racist insinuation. And then, with Trump established as both a beneficiary and catalyst of American bigotry, she dropped the story of Machado, a former Miss Universe, on his head. ""[O]ne of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest,"" Clinton said. ""He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman 'Miss Piggy.' Then he called her 'Miss Housekeeping,' because she was Latina."" In the narrative of this election, Donald Trump is the ""politically incorrect"" one in the race. He says what ""people are thinking"" and isn't afraid of the reaction. For the most part this is nonsense. Trump's political incorrectness is just a cover for run-of-the-mill prejudice. If people don't blame Mexico for ""sending rapists"" over the border, it's not because they're cowed; it's because it isn't true. If there's an actual norm restricting honest discussion for fear of giving offense, it's around white racism. Hence the storm of criticism for Clinton's ""basket of deplorables"" comment, condemned because it violated political custom--don't attack the other side's voters--not because it was untrue. ""No. 1 rule of presidential politics. Okay to mock your opponent. Never a good idea to mock the electorate,"" said Michael Barbaro of the New York Times on Twitter. Clinton's gaffe was to talk about bigotry plainly, without euphemism.  And what's striking, given that backlash, is that she's continued to name and shame Trump's racism. It's no small thing to call birtherism a ""racist lie"" in front of the largest-ever debate audience. Presidential candidates slam opponents for almost everything under the sun. But not racism. Not because it isn't present, but because it risks alienating white voters who aren't comfortable with accusations of racial prejudice or racist intent. But last week, facing an estimated 85 million viewers, Clinton did just that, in a way that wasn't imaginable four years ago (when Barack Obama ran against Mitt Romney and his veiled racial appeals), eight years ago (when Sarah Palin fueled her nascent celebrity with raw white resentment), and certainly 30 years ago, when George H.W. Bush and the Republican Party stoked white fears of black crime for political gain, crushing Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis in the process. What changed to make Clinton--a woman of profound political caution, the virtual avatar of modern-day Democratic centrism--willing to name racism when she sees it? To describe millions of voters as ""deplorables"" with racist and misogynistic views?  To call the things what they are, even if it alienates voters? The answer is straightforward. Clinton may represent the middle way of Democratic politics, but that middle way is substantively and electorally different from the middle way of the 1990s, when her husband was in office. Clinton can talk openly about white racism because she doesn't need the old Democratic electorate. In the 1990s, Democrats needed white voters and struggled to pull them into the fold, in part because of the party's liberalism and its strong identification with black Americans and black political interests. The closing months of the 1988 presidential campaign were a testament to this challenge. Using the case of Willie Horton, a convicted murderer who, on a furlough from prison, abducted and assaulted a white couple in their home, the Republican Party and the George H.W. Bush campaign portrayed the Democratic Party and its nominee Michael Dukakis as dramatically and disastrously ""soft on crime."" What's key is that, implicitly, this also meant ""soft on blacks."" Horton was a young black man, and as political scientist Tali Mendelberg writes in The Race Card, ""news coverage of the message was highly visual, conveying the story with racially stereotypic imagery, such as Horton's glowering mug shot."" In a nation still rocked by violent crime, Horton evoked potent stereotypes of black criminality and stood as a symbol of alleged liberal leniency for black criminals. Dukakis lost. Badly. Bush captured more than 53 percent of the popular vote and earned 426 Electoral College votes from 40 states. It was a drubbing, among the worst in American political history. And in the aftermath of Dukakis' defeat, the next Democratic nominee for president, Bill Clinton, watched, learned, and vowed that neither he nor his party would get Willie Horton'd--or, in the old George Wallace phrase, ""out-niggered""--by the GOP again. Running in 1992, Clinton danced a two-step. He tied himself to black voters and black communities, winning huge support through deft use of cultural affinity. He emphasized his Southern heritage: Here was a poor boy from Arkansas who could relate, personally, to the lives of many black Americans. At the same time, however, Clinton made a direct play to the cultural anxieties and political resentments of those whites who'd abandoned Dukakis for Bush. Midway through the campaign, he flew to Arkansas to oversee the execution of Ricky Ray Rector. Rector had killed two people--including a police officer--and then tried to kill himself, suffering severe mental impairment in the process. Rector did not and could not understand his eventual fate, but Clinton would not pardon him. ""I can be nicked for a lot,"" the Arkansas governor reportedly said after the execution, ""but no one can say I'm soft on crime."" His most infamous move in this two-step came later, when Clinton agreed to speak at Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition conference that summer. In addition to Clinton, Jackson had also invited Sister Souljah, a rapper and activist then in the news for her heated remarks about the riots in Los Angeles. ""If black people kill black people every day, why not have a week and kill white people?"" she said in an interview with the Washington Post. Her music featured similar sentiments, all the more controversial given larger public concern with the rise of hip-hop as a mainstream cultural product. Clinton used the conference to condemn Souljah and distance himself from Jackson, in a direct play for white moderates. ""If you took the words white and black, and you reversed them, you might think David Duke was giving that speech,"" said Clinton of Souljah's rhetoric. Both moves would help Clinton win skeptical white workers and professionals, who worried that the Democratic Party was beholden to black voters. And in office, Clinton would continue the dance, pushing a controversial anti-crime bill and signing welfare reform in an effort to end ""dependency"" among low-income blacks. It was a politics indexed to white anxiety. The Democratic Party of Bill Clinton relied on voters who were unfriendly--even hostile--to racial liberalism. And it moved accordingly. Bolstered by the economy as well as these cultural moves, Clinton would claim the center of American politics, winning an easy re-election and eventually ending his term as one of the most popular presidents in recent memory, despite scandal and an impeachment attempt. But that was then. Today, those voters--among them millions of working-class white men--are lost to the Democratic Party, in a shift that began under George W. Bush but accelerated under the presidency of Barack Obama. Democrats today win a smaller share of white voters--and the white workers in particular--than ever before. The home for those voters is in the GOP, under Trump, who turned a substantial majority with working-class whites into an overwhelming one, enough to win Ohio and Iowa and possibly other Midwestern states. But there's been a backlash to this backlash. Trump's success with working-class whites has come at the expense of the Republican Party's historic advantage with college-educated and professional whites, who now favor Hillary Clinton. Increasingly, the Democratic electorate is shorn of those voters who are skeptical of racial and cultural liberalism or who vote on that skepticism. Bill Clinton distanced himself from anything that smacked of identity politics or traditional liberalism. Hillary Clinton has not. This speaks to a larger reality in American politics. Racism--either virulent or implicit--is the enemy of progressive political coalitions. It's either an obstacle to building those coalitions in the first place, or it's a part of the process that unravels them. White departure from the Democratic Party cost it the Oval Office for nearly 20 years, and the effort to win those whites back yielded a disappointing and myopic centrism. But now those whites aren't as central to Democratic presidential fortunes, and it has given many in the party the space they need to move in a more liberal direction. And looking at the tenor of Democratic policy debates over the past year--debates over how the welfare state should expand, not if it should--they have. Which is to say that the great upside of this shift is for the blacks, Latinos, and young people who form a critical part of the Democratic Party's national electorate. Their demands for criminal justice reform, immigration reform, and broader economic reform--as channeled through the primary campaign of Bernie Sanders--aren't a deal-breaker for national Democratic politicians. The danger, as we see in this election, is that this imperils valuable electoral real estate. And in nonpresidential elections, it puts Democrats at a distinct disadvantage. It is hard to win back the House of Representatives, for instance, when you have little traction with working-class whites in the Midwest. At the same time, there's an opportunity. A Democratic Party that doesn't need to win more than a modest minority of working-class white men is one that can lean further toward racial liberalism, to mobilize its black and Latino supporters and to win over those culturally liberal whites. It can embrace comprehensive immigration reform, champion LGBTQ rights, and assail implicit bias without threatening its ability to win national elections. National Democrats can even dance a different kind of two-step, baiting prejudiced opponents into expressing that prejudice and condemning them for all the world to see. Not just to slam their opponents, but to mobilize their supporters. To show which side they're on, and that they aren't pandering to the wrong voters. It's what Clinton did with ""deplorables,"" and it's what she did a week ago, demonstrating for nonwhite voters her distance from the racist corners of the electorate just as surely as her husband, in 1992, used Sister Souljah to demonstrate his independence from black interests. And it's only possible because the Democratic Party of President Clinton is gone, replaced by the one built by President Obama and his allies. It's a more liberal and more cosmopolitan Democratic Party, one that doesn't see a national future in winning white workers from the GOP. Hillary Clinton is still on track to win this presidential election. And barring an extraordinary--and unlikely--collapse in Trump's support, she will do so with a revamped Obama coalition, comprising nonwhites; young voters; and an unprecedented number of moderate, suburban whites. She will have claimed the center of American politics, not by pandering to popular prejudices, but by rejecting them. But the rhetorical freedom afforded by this racial and generational shift in Democratic politics has its costs. Broad coalitions are often shallow ones, and that's especially true here. The Obama/Clinton coalition isn't large enough or deep enough to win the House of Representatives, and it seems, increasingly, that it isn't large enough to win the Senate either. A President Hillary Clinton will enter office without the majorities she needs to pursue her agenda. If she can't pursue her agenda, she can't deliver promised benefits to her supporters. And as we've seen in the Republican Party, with this year's presidential primary, leaders who can't deliver are leaders who are vulnerable to backlash. Democrats have crafted a new center over which a different Clinton will preside. How long it will hold is a question of enormous consequence to the progressive agenda.

10	10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/dilbert_creator_scott_adams_gets_trump_like_no_one_else.html	"""I'm healthy, single, rich, and totally free to do what I want, whenever I want. My personal life is extraordinary."" So says Scott Adams, creator of Dilbert, graphomaniacal blogger, and (if he does say so himself), ""the best political predictor in the history of Earth."" Adams--who is 59 and lives in Northern California--has lately gotten a good deal of attention for having foreseen the rise of Donald Trump. That the creator of an anodyne and highly successful comic strip about office culture should have a minor role in this election is not quite as surprising as it seems. Dilbert seems to function largely as a business endeavor for Adams. His true calling is advocating on behalf of his own colossal brilliance. Trump vs. Clinton is merely the latest and largest forum in which Adams has sought to prove his case. He arrived on the pundit scene with a splash: He announced way back in the summer of 2015 that Trump was going to win the Republican nomination. He came to this knowledge not via fancy polling models or sophisticated political science analyses, but just by watching the election unfold through what he calls his ""Master Persuader lens."" Adams is a trained hypnotist, and as such he can't help but recognize the mesmeric brilliance of nearly everything that Trump says and does. Here he is after Trump's call for a ban on Muslims: ""By the 2D filter, where people use logic and reason to make decisions, Trump is dead and done. ... But in the 3D world of emotion, where Trump exclusively plays, he has set the world up for the most clever persuasion you will ever see."" We mortals supposed that the election would play out as a contest of ideas. Adams, like Trump, recognized that it would instead play out at the limbic level of primal furies and genital anxieties. This past year, Adams has been taking to his keyboard as often as 10 times a week to remind the world of the scale of his accomplishment. He has not (until just this past week, anyway) been carrying on like this out of any desire to see Trump win. Far from it. He merely sees in Trump a Master Persuader of world-historical significance, and what with Adams being a Master Persuader himself, well, greatness can't help but recognize greatness. On Sunday, driven largely by concerns about estate taxes and about Hillary Clinton's health, Adams did finally endorse Trump, but again, this was a matter not of partisanship but of helplessly superior perception. As a hypnotist, Adams has been taught to read ""subtle bodily changes,"" and he could no longer ignore what Clinton's eyes and complexion were telling him. Adams may be burdened with precognition, but he is not, as you may have surmised, burdened with humility. He is the possessor of both ""six-pack abs"" and ""perfectly functioning knees."" He is, at this moment, very likely seated ""next to the fireplace in [his] mansion."" He is prone to typing sentences like this: ""My language skills activate your sex drive, and you know it."" To read his blog--and I recently spent a week mainlining the 1,000-plus pages that he's published in the 15 months since Trump declared his candidacy--is to overdose on a custom blend of testosterone, paranoia, and self-celebration. Here he is explaining that in the event of a Trump victory, he, Adams, ""would be a top-ten assassination target."" Here he is lamenting the ""humiliation of the American male,"" as evidenced by a dishwasher detergent ad. Here he is unforgettably (I've tried) attempting to hypnotize his readers into having the best orgasms of their lives (""I want you wet, or hard, and especially obedient ...""). I embarked on my week of Adams immersion in the hopes that it might help me gauge the proper degree of alarm to feel regarding his prediction of a Trump landslide (after a brief and uncharacteristic period of wobbling this summer, he has lately resumed giving his posts titles like ""How to Know an Election Is Over""). Was Adams a crank who'd gotten lucky? Or was he a ""super-wizard"" (his term) to whom the future was no more inscrutable than a movie marquee? I have, after all my reading, come to be skeptical of Adams' predictive powers. He guessed that Trump would win the Iowa caucus, and then when he didn't, Adams spent 1,000-plus words laying out the case for its having been rigged. He predicted that the Democratic Convention, due to its testosterone-dampening effects, would lead to history's first post-convention anti-bounce. Adams may well be right that Trump will win in November, but his predictions thus far have tended to bear a suspicious resemblance to his desires: that henpecked husbands should rise up in rebellion, that Adams' particular skill set should prove to be unbeatable. This isn't to say, though, that his blog is without value. I believe, in fact, that I've found in it something even rarer and more precious than a crystal ball: I've found a portal into Donald Trump's head. It's a truism, by this point, that Trump's inner life is a mystery. We've learned in the course of this campaign what it's like to be Trump's butler, and his ghostwriter, and his doctor, and his daughter; we've read whole forests' worth of newsprint about what it's like to be one of his supporters. But what it's like to be Trump himself--what goes on inside that very good brain--has remained stubbornly unknowable. Megyn Kelly imagined him, in the privacy of his apartment, padding around in a smoking jacket and slippers. Mark Singer, probably the best Trump profiler, could only conclude that Trump has cast off the burden of having an inner life like he has cast off the burden of flying commercial, that he is ""untroubled by the rumblings of a soul."" I am here to report that he has done no such thing and that the rumblings of his soul are in fact being recorded, with seismographic precision and stupefying regularity, on a Tumblr maintained out of Pleasanton, California.* The notion of a Trump-Adams nexus is not original with me; as with most viable ideas, Adams got there first. ""When I observe Trump,"" writes Adams, ""I can see the scaffolding of his thinking process because it is close enough to my own that the patterns are obvious."" A bit later he adds, incredulously: ""Do you know what flaws people most often accuse me of? Lack of empathy. And narcissism, obviously."" (He goes on to explain that, having sated all conceivable material desires, he, like Trump, is in fact driven merely by the knowledge that his ""unique skill set can produce an outsized benefit for the rest of you."") And lest we should mistake Adams for a titan of a lesser order than Trump, he addresses the question on everyone's mind: ""You might be wondering if I could use my wizard powers to become president someday myself. The quick answer is yes ..."" But Adams and Trump are not just characterological twins. Throughout Adams' blog they are also, thanks to their shared stake in the election, riding side by side on the same psychic roller coaster. First came the audacious early confidence (""Trump will win Iowa and run the table""). Then the months of trench warfare (""I see that Trump is bringing a flamethrower to a stick fight, but most of you only see a stick in his hand ...""). Finally the endless, orgiastically affirming victories (""The Master Persuader filter continues to predict with spooky accuracy""). Every time Trump wins, Adams wins, too--Trump is the giant crushing his rivals one by one; Adams is the genius who saw that he would do it. But Adams' blog is more than just the lesser-known cousin of Trump's Twitter feed. Adams has actual expressive gifts and the inclination to use them. He is Trump injected with truth serum, Trump without the need of a ghostwriter. By going on for thousands of words where Trump uses a dozen, Adams can't help but make visible--in a way that Trump would never dare--the costs of keeping such a massive ego machine running, the places where the gears grind and stall. Last October, in a post defending both himself and Trump from the charge of narcissism, Adams wrote: ""I'm a big fan of being admired, assuming I did something worthy. ... I also work continuously to keep my sense of importance as high as possible, for health reasons, for happiness reasons, and for career reasons. ... I consider my self-inflated sense of importance an asset."" Adams is revealing something genuinely touching here: that his braggadocio is partly an act, a means of psyching himself up. He was once, as he says, a man with ""no obvious artistic talent and no training whatsoever,"" and he has, by harnessing narcissism, achieved great and indisputable success. But the rest of his blog demonstrates, with the clarity of a fable, how dangerous it is to set an ego machine loose in one's inner command center. As his rightness about Trump became more apparent throughout last summer and fall, Adams' blog changed--posts started getting longer and more frequent. His updates began to multiply. More and more of his blog was devoted to things that other people had written about him, or to praise he'd gotten, or to people he'd humiliated. The dreary repetitiousness of compulsion crept in. His ego worked very well for him, in other words--it earned him the freedom to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants--until the only thing it let him want was to be right about something, and to be praised for it. Which brings me back, of course, to Trump. One way to think of him--and the way I've always thought of him--is as a narcissistic and spectacularly un-self-aware ogre. But another, and possibly truer, way to think of him is as a man who at some point discovered the singular force of the ego engine (look at those buildings! look at those wives!) but who now, though it may yet bring him a job for which he is ruinously unfit or humiliation on a scale he can't fathom, doesn't know how to switch it off. So there's one more, grubby truth with which I emerged from my week spent waist-deep in Adams' psyche: that I'd already known what it's like to be Trump--that in fact I've got a little Trump buzzing away in me even now. It's the part of me that, more than a few times, has daydreamed about what it would be like to visit Adams' blog on the day after a Clinton victory, that little inner end zone dance. And it's the part of me that would experience a Trump win less as a historic disaster than as a personal humiliation. It's the part, in other words, that thinks of the election's global implications as mere packing peanuts around the real prize: having been right all along. *Correction, Oct. 4, 2016: This story misidentified Scott Adams' blog as a WordPress blog.

11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_next_20/2016/09/how_the_iraq_war_wrecked_the_gop.html	In 1995, when Michael Kinsley approached Microsoft with the idea that would become Slate, the Republican Party had occupied the White House for all but two of the previous 14 years. The Soviet Union was dead. Foreign policy was a national afterthought. Violent crime was at a peak, a staple of Republican campaigns. The country had just suffered its worst terror attack, a bombing in Oklahoma City by white extremists. In the 1994 elections, the GOP had picked up 10 governorships, eight Senate seats, and 54 House seats, seizing control of Congress. When people talked about a war in Iraq, they meant the Persian Gulf War of 1990-91, led by President George H.W. Bush and hailed as a triumph of international law enforcement. Two decades later, that landscape is unrecognizable. Democrats are likely to retain the presidency for a third consecutive term, a feat unseen since the GOP reign of 1981 to 1993. Russia is a resurgent predator. Republicans in Congress talk more about criminal justice reform than they do about crime. Several of this year's Republican presidential candidates campaigned against the National Security Agency, and most recoiled from the idea of sending troops to the Middle East. The party's nominee, Donald Trump, brags that he opposed the Iraq war, a lie that reflects how far the political winds have shifted. Many events contributed to these changes. A few obvious examples are 9/11, the great recession, and the Arab Spring. But one story overshadows them all: the Iraq war. Its direct consequences are obvious: a regime toppled, lives lost, money spent, and an aftermath of strife, chaos, and terror. What's less well-understood are its political ramifications. The war left two political vacuums. One is in Iraq, where the post-Saddam government can barely hold its own against ISIS and other sectarian forces. The other is in the United States. The war discredited Republican management of the presidency. George W. Bush devoted six years to a massive policing and nation-building project, and he failed. His failure destroyed the GOP's self-confidence and led many Americans to turn away, embracing alternatives on the left and right. I supported the resolution that gave Bush the authority to go to war. I can bore you with lots of excuses about how Bush didn't use that authority the way I thought he should. They're the same excuses you've heard from Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, John Kerry, and all the other Democrats who voted for the resolution. But the bottom line, 14 years later, is that people like me still have to make excuses. We're embarrassed and chastened. And even for supporters of the war who aren't chastened, it's a wound that never heals. Iraq is a mess they'll always have to defend. Not many people, even on the right, praise Bush today. Budget hawks wince at the deficits he piled up by cutting taxes while failing to tackle entitlements. Republican politicians pretend their party had nothing to do with the financial crash. Conservatives are still choking on the bailouts. But the party's biggest black eye is Iraq. In every Gallup Poll for the past 10 years, most Americans have said the war was a mistake. Two years ago, in an Economist/YouGov survey, 69 percent of Republicans said Iraq probably would never become a stable democracy. A plurality of Republicans, 47 percent to 34 percent, said the United States had failed to accomplish its objectives. Before the war, Vice President Dick Cheney assured Americans that Iraqis, fed up with Saddam Hussein, would embrace our troops as liberators. That prediction proved naive. But Cheney wasn't wrong about pent-up rage in Iraq. It's the same rage that later erupted in Egypt, Libya, and Syria. When dictators suppress dissent, eventually the dissent explodes. The same thing can happen in democracies. The explosion is weaker because the suppression is weaker. But it can happen in a country like ours--and as the war dragged on, it did. Bush and Cheney made the 2004 election a referendum on Iraq. They attacked the patriotism of anyone who criticized their conduct of the war. This ruthless strategy secured their re-election, but it came at a price. As the occupation soured and the body bags piled up, public unease turned to unrest and anger. Were Iraqis better off than they had been under Saddam? Was America safer? Where were the weapons of mass destruction? Why had we invaded a country that had nothing to do with 9/11? How had a party that ridiculed the competence of government at home led us into a bloody, multi-trillion-dollar nation-building project abroad? In 2006, voters stripped the Republican Party of its majorities in Congress. In 2008, they evicted it from the White House. Today, the GOP is a failed state. It failed at fiscal management, economic stewardship, and military judgment. Then, when sectarian forces rose up on the right, GOP leaders failed to confront them. Anti-government, anti-gun control, and anti-immigrant zealots seized control of Republican primaries and cowed Republican lawmakers.* Now these militants have put their own warlord, Trump, on the throne. He spurns everything the establishment stood for: internationalism, free trade, migrant labor, decorum, expertise. To his critics in the Republican elite, Trump has a one-word answer: Iraq. These are the geniuses who wrecked our country, he says. Ignore them. Iraq shook the Democratic establishment, too. It cost Hillary Clinton her party's nomination for president in 2008. Eight years later, it nearly cost her the nomination again, this time to a socialist. While Trump ridiculed Jeb Bush and other hawks for having supported the war, Bernie Sanders hammered the same point against Clinton. Months after Sanders left the race, Trump still quotes one of the Vermont senator's most damning lines: that Clinton's vote to authorize the use of force showed bad judgment. Trump also rebukes Clinton for the 2011 military intervention in Libya, in which she and President Obama tried and failed to avoid the creation of another breeding ground for terrorism. Clinton hasn't sworn off another Libya-style air campaign, but she's pledging not to send troops back to the Middle East. No more Iraqs. Trump and Sanders are right to criticize the politicians who led us into war. But the sins of the old order don't validate the new disorder. That's obvious in Iraq, where Saddam's dictatorship has been replaced by ethnic and religious violence. It's also true in the United States. The establishment's collapse hasn't spawned an enlightenment. It has accelerated our ideological segregation. The GOP has become a party of denunciations and show votes, disowning not just the war but any role in governing the country. The Democratic Party, sick of war and wage stagnation, remains in Clinton's grip but is increasingly dominated by people who have lost patience with fiscal restraint and the role of global policeman. Many of us, Slate included, are drifting into echo chambers on the left or right. There won't be another war like Iraq for a long time. That's because it's the mistake we just made. Instead, we'll repeat one of the mistakes we made before Iraq. Maybe it will be a humanitarian mission gone bad, like Somalia. Or a lapse of vigilance, like 9/11. Or passivity in the face of genocide, like Rwanda. When our descendants reproach us, it won't be just for what we did in Iraq. It will be for what we didn't do in Syria, where roughly 430,000 people have died in the past five years. We're always fighting the last war. Or, in this case, not fighting it. *Correction, Sept. 28, 2016: This article originally misstated that the sectarian forces that seized control of the GOP primaries were anti-gun.

It's good to cheat. It's good to steal. Trump has campaigned on his business savvy all along. He says he'll do for America what he's done for his companies: make a killing. In the debate, he bragged that he had racked up nearly $700 million in income in the past year. ""That's the kind of thinking that our country needs,"" he declared. ""When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country ... it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money."" But Trump doesn't just talk about beating the Mexicans and the Chinese. He talks about beating Americans. Fifteen minutes into the debate, Hillary Clinton brought up the financial crisis of 2007-08 and the ensuing recession that wiped out jobs, homes, and savings. ""Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis,"" she recalled. ""He said back in 2006, 'Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.' "" At this point, Trump interrupted Clinton--not to deny the quote, but to defend it. ""That's called business,"" he retorted. Twenty minutes later, Clinton pressed Trump about his refusal to release his tax returns. ""Maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes,"" she said. ""The only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license. And they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax."" Again, Trump butted in, not to dispute the charge, but to flaunt it. ""That makes me smart,"" he gloated. Trump asserted that the country ""needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas."" Clinton, in reply, said one reason for the budget squeeze might be that ""you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years."" Trump didn't blanch.

And in the post-debate spin room at Hofstra University, his campaign's answer wasn't much better. The segment over Trump's tax returns was among the sharpest of the debate, due to the uncharacteristic aggressiveness of Hillary Clinton's insinuations and the lackadaisical nature of Trump's responses. Clinton, after a dicey early segment on trade--in which she seemed jarred by either Trump's combative demeanor or her own spotty record on NAFTA and TPP--seized the offensive when the question turned to Trump's tax returns. Clinton suggested that one reason he may not be releasing them is because ""he's paid nothing in federal taxes,"" as he didn't in some of the years we know about. ""That makes me smart,"" Trump interjected. When the subject turned to infrastructure spending, Trump said to Clinton that ""we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas."" ""And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years,"" Clinton said, before Trump interrupted again: ""It would be squandered too, believe me."" Maybe Trump was just making one of his ""jokes"" here, but since Clinton didn't press further about what ""would be squandered"" meant, we don't know whether that was an admission that he doesn't pay any federal income taxes or... ? Fortunately, at debates, one can turn to the spin room for immediate illumination from campaign staffers. Unless they, too, have no clear answers.

15	15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/rudy_giuliani_compared_donald_trump_to_a_saint_and_then_things_got_silly.html	"On Sunday, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani went on five political talk shows to answer questions about Donald Trump. The questions concerned a 2005 videotape, released Friday, that showed Trump boasting in crude language--on a microphone he didn't know was live--about using his financial and celebrity power to make unwanted, physically aggressive sexual advances toward women. Most people don't have the stomach to defend a sexual predator. Indeed, the Trump campaign canceled the networks' scheduled interviews with its other surrogates. But Giuliani, who presents himself as a prosecutor with no tolerance for lawbreaking, filled in admirably as a defense attorney. In fact, he spun the tape as a reason to vote for, not against, his boss. Here's what the former mayor said. 1. That's not the real Trump. Giuliani insisted that Trump had always been a ""gentleman"" and had never spoken such vulgarities in his presence. On Meet the Press, Giuliani claimed that on Friday, when Trump was ""confronted"" with the evidence, ""he was pretty darn shocked that he had said such terrible things."" The real Trump, the gentleman, had no acquaintance with the cad in the video. At one point, Giuliani suggested that Trump ""didn't remember"" having said what was on the tape. Which means that if a witness had described what Trump said in the 2005 conversation, absent the tape, Trump would have denied it and gotten away with it. The Sunday morning moderators threw more evidence at Giuliani. Chuck Todd played a tape of Trump bragging, in a 2008 episode of Howard Stern's radio show, about going backstage at a beauty pageant and ogling naked women ""because I'm the owner of the pageant."" Giuliani shrugged off the quote as a fiction. ""On that show, a lot of things are said that aren't true, he told Todd. ""You just say them because they're funny."" Todd cited the case of Temple Taggart, a beauty contestant who accused Trump of kissing her on the lips without invitation. Giuliani insisted that Trump's statements on the tape didn't validate such stories: ""I don't know how much he was exaggerating,"" said Giuliani. Chris Wallace cited the ""long history of Trump making aggressive moves on women. He's been sued for sexual harassment, and there are decades of insults of women."" Again, Giuliani shrugged it off. ""I know Donald Trump for almost 30 years,"" he said. ""Doesn't reflect the man that I know."" So the public Trump, when he's well-behaved, is the real one. The private, filthy Trump, even when he's caught on tape, is the fake one. But in Hillary Clinton's case, it's just the opposite. Clinton's speeches to Wall Street executives, disclosed in a WikiLeaks dump on Friday, show she's ""one person in private and another person in public,"" Giuliani told John Dickerson. To Wallace, he added: ""We have two Hillary Clintons--which says we have a person who's a liar."" 2. We're all sinners. On several shows, Giuliani whipped out Catholic theology. He pleaded that all of us sin and that Trump has repented. Giuliani swore that Trump was ""contrite"" about his 2005 remarks, even though Trump, in a video statement, displayed no such contrition. Therefore, Giuliani concluded, Trump should be forgiven. He added that Trump shouldn't be singled out for the things he said on the tape, because ""this is unfortunately the kind of talk that goes on among a lot of people."" Everybody does it. But the former mayor didn't stop there. He claimed that Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, her attempts to cover up and excuse it, her speeches to Wall Street executives, and her family foundation's acceptance of money from people with business before the State Department were ""equal or worse than"" than anything in the tapes. Giuliani also tried to shame as a hypocrite anyone who might criticize Trump. ""He who hasn't sinned should cast the first stone,"" said Giuliani. When he was asked about Republican officeholders who had denounced Trump after seeing the tape, Giuliani scoffed: ""Maybe a lot of them are perfect people."" On Face the Nation, he played the God card, suggesting that only Jesus Christ was innocent enough to criticize Trump. 3. Running for president has made Trump a better man. Giuliani, like Trump, argued that Clinton's years in politics have corrupted her. But he claimed that running for office has done just the opposite for Trump: It has cleansed him. In the 2005 tape, Trump was just an ""entertainment star,"" said Giuliani. ""He wasn't thinking of office."" As a non-politician, he wasn't thinking or speaking seriously. That's a complete inversion of what Trump has told us. For the past year and a half, Trump has claimed that politicians lie and that only a nonpolitician can tell the truth. But Giuliani, as he pulled this 180, didn't even blink. He described politics as a religious experience, preaching that Trump"	Rudy Giuliani Compared Donald Trump to a Saint. Then Things Got Silly.

16	16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/donald_trump_could_have_been_president_don_t_forget_it.html	Donald Trump is never going to be the president of the United States. As we sit and digest each successive leak of damaging material, each un-endorsement, each Trump threat to attack Hillary Clinton in the most personal terms imaginable, the fact remains that Trump has almost surely destroyed his chance of ever becoming the most powerful man on Earth. The discussion will now slowly shift to Republican hopes of shoring up down-ballot races and (just wait) the creation of Trump TV. But we cannot and should not forget: A couple days ago it was still fathomable that America could have voted into office the biggest threat to the country in decades. The danger of Donald Trump is, and always was, twofold. He leads a movement that is bigoted and racist and plays to people's worst impulses. He promises policies--many of which are bigoted and racist--that would be extraordinarily dangerous for America. He has brought into the public dialogue a level of vitriol that shows no signs of abating. His contempt for the truth--for science, for common sense, for honesty about anything, really--are astonishing to behold, even after nearly 18 months. His authoritarianism, however emphasized to cement his tough-guy image, is real and frightening. If Donald Trump disappears from public life tomorrow, many of these things (and the support they inspired), which together we might call Trumpism, will remain. And so, even if he drops out tomorrow, we have a lot to reckon with going forward. But there has always been another side to the prospect of a Trump presidency, beyond any calculation of Trump's policies or undemocratic nature. And that is, simply, that Donald Trump would become president. Thin-skinned, corrupt, incompetent, bullying, immature, mentally fragile, full of rage: all of these qualities have been in ample abundance for well over a year, and in office they would promise to be catastrophic. It was no exaggeration to say Trump could potentially have made horrific errors of judgment as president and that his lack of stability could threaten the stability of the world. Even assuming Trumpism survives, this part of Trump's rise--Donald Trump, the man--will not. A vile and dangerous person who should never run a nuclear-armed country with the most powerful military in human history will not do so. The problem with treating Trump's candidacy as being so deathly serious, however, was always that, in addition to being a racist demagogue, Trump is also a buffoonish jerk who tweets at 3 a.m. and loves nothing more than to put on a show. So even when he gained in the polls and ticked up past 40 percent on some forecasting sites, to many, he was still a joke. The leak of Trump's disgusting remarks on Friday, although putting a near end to his chances, in a way also reinforced this idea. Just look at how ridiculous and gross he is, I heard more than one person say. Today, it might feel inevitable that he would crash and burn, and it was always likely. But it wasn't a sure thing. We could have elected him. To say that American society is currently divided (and damaged) is a cliche, but also correct. To note that Hillary Clinton shares many of the establishment's worst traits and promises to oversee an ethically challenged and inevitably unpopular administration goes without saying. To worry that what Donald Trump has unleashed will stay unleashed is sensible. But for a moment, we should pause to reflect on the fact that he will not be president and that America and the world have probably avoided a catastrophe of unknown proportions.

17	17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/what_happens_if_donald_trump_withdraws.html	"By all accounts, Donald Trump's Republican presidential campaign is imploding, with the latest revelations from a leaked 2005 Access Hollywood taping showing not only Trump's disrespect for women but a boast about what amounts to a sexual assault. (Why anyone should be surprised by this given Trump's previous statements and actions is hard to fathom; take the latest expressions of shock with a huge grain of salt). Hillary Clinton, who was already leading in the polls and seemed likely to continue her lead despite new leaked revelations that she supports free trade and is cozier with banks and big business than she's admitted (again, no surprise there for anyone paying attention), now seems even more likely to prevail. Trump has run the worst presidential campaign in modern history, judged only by the week after his poor debate performance featuring comments taking on a former beauty contestant as too fat, complaining about his microphone, supporting the convictions of the exonerated Central Park 5, and making new irresponsible claims about vote-rigging and Mexicans coming across the border to vote. And all of that came before the ""grab them by the pussy"" comments came out. Now, as many members of the Republican establishment issue condemnations of him but still say they will vote for him and support his choice for the Supreme Court, a few are starting to break ranks, calling on him to withdraw. What happens if Trump withdraws? Back in August, I wrote about how Republicans could name a substitute for Trump if his spot on the ticket was vacant and that courts should bend over backward to allow Republicans to list a replacement on the ballot so voters would have a meaningful choice. But now that option comes too late. Not only are absentee ballots out, but many people have already voted. Election Day has passed for hundreds of thousands of people already. (That's no reason to oppose early voting; most early voters are committed partisans, and few who voted for Trump would likely have second thoughts now.) But if Trump withdraws, and in fact even if he doesn't, there is one other possible way out: the Electoral College. When we cast our votes for president, they are actually cast for electors from each state (based roughly on population size) who then cast ballots for president. If Trump is chosen in some states, those electors could vote for Mike Pence, or Mitt Romney, or John Kasich, or whoever. There are some laws that bar ""faithless"" electors from casting votes for anyone who did not win the popular vote in a state, but I have a hard time believing either the Republican-controlled House or a court (because it raises a political question) would stop the actions of a faithless elector. Ned Foley games out how conflicts would work under the 12th Amendment; the bottom line is that if Trump got more votes than Clinton and Republicans retained control, we could well end up with a President Pence. (When no one gets a majority in the Electoral College, the House votes on a one-state-delegation-one-vote rule.) The reason this is such a Hail Mary is because it depends on a huge number of unlikely contingencies: Trump withdraws, or the Republican leadership abandons him yet still get voters to choose Trump on the ballot; the ""Trump"" campaign gets more Electoral College votes than the Clinton campaign (requiring a lot of thinking and effort on the part of battered voters); electors chosen by the Trump campaign to serve the Republican ticket (some of whom love Donald Trump) would act faithlessly and vote for Pence or someone else; and Republicans control the Senate. All of this is possible but not bloody likely. That's why the more plausible scenario is the following: After Sunday's debate, when Trump does not do well, more members of the Republican leadership start withdrawing their endorsements. Watch Paul Ryan move before Mitch McConnell, because Ryan has presidential aspirations of his own. Trump is essentially left twisting in the wind. The big message from Republicans is to vote for Republicans in the U.S. Senate to block Hillary Clinton from getting her agenda passed. More money from the Koch brothers, Sheldon Adelson, and other plutocrats floods into the Senate races, which right now are very close on the question of control. And the more that Republican Senate candidates can distance themselves from Trump, the more likely it is that swing voters split their tickets and vote for the Republican Senate candidate. The end game now is about denying Clinton control of the Senate, and with that comes loss of a free hand to choose a Supreme Court nominee (because if Democrats take even one seat of control, I expect they will nuke the filibuster to put in whomever they want for the Supreme Court). As I argued a year ago, the Supreme Court is the most important civil rights issue of our time: ""It is more important than racial justice, marriage equality, voting rights, money in politics, abortion rights, gun rights, or managing climate change. It matters more because the ability to move forward in these other civil rights struggles depends first and foremost upon control of the Court. And control for the next generation is about to be up for grabs, likely in the next presidential election, a point many on the right but few on the left seem to have recognized."" There's so much at stake even if, as expected, Trump continues to implode. Originally published in slightly different form on Election Law Blog. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

A handful of (Gallup-selected) citizens will be in the room, posing questions to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The candidates will mosey about and interact directly with these undecided voters. The town hall concept was introduced at the presidential level in 1992. Bill Clinton requested it, and watching clips now, it's easy to see why. He had an ease and empathy with people one on one, assuring them he was present and listening. By contrast, George H.W. Bush was so aloof (or bored, or antsy to get off the stage) that he at one point, disastrously, glanced at his watch on camera.

How did we get here? Read on. Donald Trump spins so many tales--and goes after so many different groups and individuals--that it's sometimes easy to miss his most invidious rhetoric. For months, the Republican presidential nominee has undermined confidence in our electoral system, warning his supporters that this election will be ""rigged"" and stolen through ""voter fraud."" Trump first told his supporters of this conspiracy theory at an Ohio rally in August and followed up the claim in an interview with Sean Hannity: ""I'm telling you, Nov. 8, we'd better be careful because that election is going to be rigged. And I hope the Republicans are watching closely, or it's going to be taken away from us."" This was in line with comments from his surrogates, like longtime adviser Roger Stone, who told Breitbart that Trump would begin to talk ""constantly"" about voter fraud. ""He needs to say for example, today would be a perfect example: 'I am leading in Florida. The polls all show it. If I lose Florida, we will know that there's voter fraud.' "" Stone continued: ""'If there's voter fraud, this election will be illegitimate, the election of the winner will be illegitimate, we will have a constitutional crisis, widespread civil disobedience, and the government will no longer be the government.'"" The implication is clear: If Trump loses, he should foment this ""civil disobedience."" And he should start preparing his supporters for it now. He seems to be doing just that. ""The only way we can lose, in my opinion ... is if cheating goes on,"" said Trump during another August rally in Pennsylvania. In Wilmington, North Carolina--where more than a century earlier, white terrorists toppled a black-led city government in a violent insurrection--Trump warned his supporters that without strict voter identification laws, people would be ""voting 15 times for Hillary."" These are rhetorical time bombs, statements that cast doubt on our democracy, planted with growing frequency as Trump tries to rationalize the fact that he's losing. There's a chance this is harmless, that Trump will resign himself to defeat if he loses to Hillary Clinton and bring his supporters with him--during the first presidential debate moderator Lester Holt asked him whether he would ""accept the outcome [of the election] as the will of the voters,"" and he said unequivocally ""the answer is that if she wins I will absolutely support her."" But that was before he lashed out against the media for his poor performance, before the polls began to tilt back in Clinton's favor. Now that he's behind, Trump has returned to questioning the legitimacy of the election. More critically, the idea that he would respect the results of the election, full stop, ignores the hatred that's come to characterize Trump's campaign, the violence he's condoned against protesters and other vocal opponents, the virulent prejudice he's brought to mainstream politics, and the apocalypticism of his message, where he stands as the final hope for an embattled minority of resentful whites. These rhetorical time bombs, in other words, could be the catalyst for actual intimidation and violence, before and after Election Day. And if that violence and intimidation strikes, it will be against the chief targets of Trump's campaign: people of color. To that point, Trump has gone beyond his attacks on the integrity of the ballot. Now, he wants his supporters to monitor the polls in places where, he says, ""fraud"" is likely. ""You've gotta go out, and you've gotta get your friends, and you've gotta get everyone you know and you've gotta watch your polling booths, because I hear too many stories about Pennsylvania, certain areas,"" said Trump at a recent rally. ""I hear too many bad stories and we can't lose an election because of you know what I'm talking about. So go and vote and go check out areas, because a lot of bad things happen and we don't wanna lose for that reason."" What does Trump mean by ""areas?"" It's simple: He means places where black people live and vote, a dog whistle calibrated to an audience of voters who have lived off of a decade of conspiracymongering, from breathless theorizing over the obscure New Black Panthers to hysteria over groups that register voters and bring them to the polls, such as ACORN. And in particular, Trump is speaking to the idea--propagated through conservative media--that Barack Obama stole the 2008 and 2012 elections by using fraud and other nefarious tactics in cities like Philadelphia. The ""evidence"" for this is Obama's high support in a handful of inner-city areas. In 2012, for instance, there were precincts in Philadelphia and Cleveland where Obama won as much as 100 percent of the vote. These predominantly black neighborhoods backed the president with overwhelming support, as they had in the previous race against John McCain. This wasn't unusual. Given the size of the country, the number of voters, and the extent of residential and political segregation, these unanimous areas--in Philadelphia, 59 divisions of several hundred voters each--were inevitable. Indeed, it happens for Republicans too. In 2008, McCain won 80 percent or more of ballots cast in counties across the interior South, despite losing the general election by 7 percentage points. But this dynamic was more pronounced in hyper-segregated communities of black Americans, an electorate that--according to exit polls--backed Obama with average support of 94 percent in his two elections. Statistically, there was a decent chance that one nearly all-black precinct or another was going to vote unanimously for the president. But to many conservatives, this was suspect. On his syndicated radio show, Hannity said that it was ""mathematically impossible"" that no one had voted for Mitt Romney in these areas and that therefore, it ""means we've got cheating going on in our elections."" Hannity's disbelief echoed across right-wing media, where outlets like Breitbart and Townhall ran with the claim that voter fraud skewed the results in cities like Philadelphia and Cleveland. When considered in the elaborate canon of right-wing media, where marginal groups like the New Black Panthers stood as a threat to the voting rights of white Americans, the message was clear: Black voters had broken the rules and stolen the election from Romney for a black president. This wasn't just a conspiracy conservatives could believe in; it was one they were primed for. The allegation that Obama ""rigged"" his election to the White House goes back to the 2008 race, when Republicans went on a crusade against the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN, an organizing group that worked to register voters and advocate for low-income families. A blitzkrieg of anti-ACORN rhetoric swept conservative media, driven by doctored and misleading videos from far-right provocateurs. In the wake of the frenzy, 52 percent of Republicans believed the ludicrous claim that the group had ""stolen the election"" for Barack Obama, comparable to the 51 percent of GOP voters who said that Obama was born outside of the United States. Today, Trump's rhetoric is having a similar effect. According to a recent poll from the Associated Press, 58 percent of his supporters believe there is voter fraud, and half say that they have ""little to no confidence in the integrity of the vote count."" Whether he realizes it or not, Trump's attack on the election process grows out of years of mainstream Republican behavior and rhetoric that revved an engine of paranoia and fear among conservative voters. In addition to its strict requirements for identification, for example, North Carolina's GOP-backed (and unconstitutional) voting law expanded the reach and authority of poll observers, allowing them to challenge any voter without cause, as long as they themselves were registered residents of the county (instead of the precinct). The provision was a boon to outfits like True the Vote, an anti-voter fraud group that essentially works to intimidate would-be voters. But this effort is also more than a tactic to try to ensure one side gets more votes than the other. The mania over voter fraud has everything to do with the election of Obama, America's first black president, who won that contest--and re-election--on the power of his performance with people of color, and black voters in particular. In response, Republicans have begun a crusade against ""fraud,"" meaning anything that enhances access to the polls, and brings these voters to the voting booth. (Actual in-person voter fraud is infinitesimally rare.) It's how we get the situation in North Carolina, where the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that those GOP lawmakers intentionally and illegally targeted black voters, searching for any measure under the sun that would limit their access to the polls. And it's how we get the one in Wisconsin, which--according to a 2014 federal ruling (since superseded)--produced a ""unique burden"" that ""disproportionately impacts black and Latino voters."" Along with Trump himself, these measures represent and channel the rage of an angry plurality of white voters that sees Obama--and the cosmopolitan America he represents--as an existential threat to their perceived place in national life. This dynamic has a history in America. White backlash to black progress--from Reconstruction to the civil rights movement--is a potent part of our past, and whenever it strikes, black voters and black voting are always the first target. On the eve of the 1868 presidential election, white vigilantes and Klansmen in the South terrorized newly enfranchised freedmen and killed black lawmakers, including state representatives in South Carolina and Arkansas. ""In Camilla, Georgia,"" writes historian Douglas Egerton in The Wars of Reconstruction: The Brief, Violent History of America's Most Progressive Era, ""Democrats opened fire on a Republican parade, killing or wounding twenty black marchers, and a black Georgia assemblyman was dragged from his home and nearly beaten to death."" In Louisiana, following the 1872 presidential election, ""Republicans charged that more than two thousand supporters had been 'killed, wounded, or otherwise injured' in the final weeks leading up to [Ulysses S.] Grant's reelection."" Authorities in one parish of the state stumbled upon the bodies of more than two dozen black Republicans. According to one account, survivors of the massacre were forced by Klansmen to march to the polls and cast a Democratic ballot. Just as common as outright violence was intimidation at the voting booth. During New Jersey's 1871 state and local elections, for example, mobs of white Democrats arrived at the polls in Camden to intimidate blacks out of casting ballots for Republican candidates. Some of this anger was pure partisanship, an effort to win by any means necessary. But the larger source was rage at the very idea of black voting, part of a broader belief that black Americans were illegitimate citizens: that they were ignorant, dependent, unworthy, and undeserving. And so it continued through American history. In 1900, after taking North Carolina's government back from a coalition of Populists and black Republicans using violence and intimidation, Democrats established Jim Crow, eliminating black voters from the state's voter rolls. Sixty years later, racial reactionaries would fight a rear-guard action against the movement for voting rights, using violence, intimidation, and as much legal chicanery as they could muster. This didn't just happen in the South. ""From 1960 to 1964 [future Chief Justice William] Rehnquist directed 'ballot security operations' for the Maricopa County Republican Party in Phoenix, known as 'Operation Eagle Eye,' which was designed to challenge the eligibility of Democratic voters at the polls,"" writes journalist Ari Berman in Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America. ""Civil rights activists with the NAACP in Arizona testified that Rehnquist had personally administered literacy tests to black and Hispanic voters at Democratic precincts in Phoenix, questioning their qualifications by asking them to read portions of the Constitution."" If we are living in the midst of another white backlash--and Trump's ethno-nationalist campaign for the White House suggests that we are--then it's only fitting that we've seen a new push against full access at the ballot box, spearheaded by a political party enthralled to a recalcitrant movement of white revanchists. Likewise, it's fitting that its symbol and head, Trump, is now channeling a sesqui-century of racial reaction. The difference between now and the past is that these new racial reactionaries are losing. For all their rage and anger, they are far short of a majority. Their primal scream isn't enough to close the electoral gap. Donald Trump is on track to lose this presidential race, shut down by a strong--if somewhat silent--majority of blacks, Latinos, Asian Americans, and young people, along with liberal and moderate whites. Still, Trump's anti-democratic conspiracymongering is unprecedented in modern elections. And we can begin to guess at the consequences of this rhetoric.  Angry people, stirred by demagoguery and convinced they've been robbed of their rightful power, are a real threat to the already-frayed fabric of our democracy. Donald Trump thinks the election is rigged. He says we need to watch ""areas."" Despite what he said at the debate, he's also said that, should he lose, he doesn't know that he will concede: ""We're going to have to see. We're going to see what happens. We're going to have to see."" And if he doesn't? If he loses and pushes his base to reject the outcome? Then we could see protests, we could see mobs--we could even see violence, all directed against the people supposedly stealing the election. It wouldn't be the first time.

20	20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/mike_pence_won_because_he_was_shameless_about_denying_reality.html	"The vice presidential debate does not move votes, and will not move votes. People commit to parties, and then they commit to the top of the ticket. Almost no one backs a ticket (or switches sides) because of the running mate. This fact--that these debates, in a real sense, don't matter--makes it tempting to treat them as pure political theater, judged on style and poise. By that standard, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence won the vice presidential debate with Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, full stop. Pence, who worked in conservative talk radio before moving to electoral politics, was calm, smooth, and steady. He was an effective advocate for conservative ideology, a polished voice for lower taxes, less redistribution, a more aggressive posture on the global stage (against Russia especially), and new restrictions on abortion. Against Kaine--who interrupted, cross-talked, and spoke in a rapid, hurried clip--Pence looked commanding, almost presidential. And on Twitter, pundits and observers began immediate speculation about the vice presidential nominee's prospects for 2020, should Donald Trump lose the election for president. But politics isn't pure theater, and we shouldn't use that standard. Who performed better is less important than whether the candidates were honest and truthful. Whether Kaine or Pence was polished and polite matters less than whether they gave a fair and good-faith accounting of themselves and their politics to the public. And by that standard, Mike Pence was a clear and abysmal failure. That is not to say that Kaine was a paragon of virtue. The Virginia senator is a long-time politician, accustomed to high political pressure. When pressed by the moderator, CBS News anchor Elaine Quijano, on certain specifics about Hillary Clinton--from her emails to her policies for the Middle East and South Asia--Kaine demurred or changed the subject or offered half an answer. He demagogued on the issue of Trump's tax avoidance, a clean attack around which Kaine tied a yellow ribbon. (""It was a fight to avoid paying taxes so that he wouldn't support the fight against terror,"" Kaine said. ""He wouldn't support troops."") But that's typical. That's ordinary behavior from a normal political figure. Pence, by contrast, was extraordinary. Most vice presidential nominees are eager to defend their running mates, to put their reputations on the line as advocates for the men (and now women) who would elevate them into the second highest office in American government. Not Mike Pence. Rather than demur or decline when confronted with Donald Trump's rhetoric and ideas, Pence denied that any of it happened. ""I can't imagine,"" said Kaine at the opening of the debate, ""how Gov. Pence can defend the insult-driven selfish 'me first' style of Donald Trump."" Pence had a simple reply. ""Let me say first and foremost that, senator, you and Hillary Clinton would know a lot about an insult-driven campaign. It really is remarkable,"" he said, before accusing Kaine of launching an ""avalanche of insults."" These insults? These insults were quotes. Kaine was quoting Donald Trump, telling viewers that Trump had called Mexicans ""rapists and criminals"" (true); that he had called women ""slobs, pigs, dogs, and disgusting"" (true); and that he had attacked an Indiana-born federal judge ""and said he was unqualified to hear a federal lawsuit because his parents were Mexican"" (also true). Despite the obvious truth of everything on display, Pence's response was to call these quotes--taken almost verbatim from Trump--a kind of ""insult"" against the Republican ticket. And so it continued for the next 90 minutes. When Kaine accused Trump of praising Russian president Vladimir Putin, asking Pence to defend his running mate, the Indiana governor denied it, shaking his head at the idea that Trump would say something positive about a ""small and bullying leader."" But it happened. Just last month, at a national security forum hosted by NBC News, Trump defended Putin by citing his popularity (""Well, he does have an 82 percent approval rating"") and giving him credit for his position in the country. ""Now, it's a very different system, and I don't happen to like the system,"" said Trump, just a month ago, on live television. ""But certainly, in that system, he's been a leader, far more than our president has been a leader."" When asked about this the next day, Mike Pence agreed. ""I think it's inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country,"" he said. When Kaine pushed Pence to defend Trump's comment that more nations should have nuclear weapons, Pence shook his head (again) and protested: ""He never said that."" But again, the record shows that Trump said exactly that. This past March, during a CNN-televised town hall in Milwaukee, Trump questioned the wisdom of nuclear nonproliferation. ""You have so many countries--China, Pakistan, you have so many countries, Russia--you have so many countries right now that have them,"" he said, ""Now, wouldn't you rather, in a certain sense, have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?"" To repeat: This happened. It was broadcast to millions of people. But Mike Pence denied it. When Kaine said that Trump wants a ""deportation force"" to round up unauthorized immigrants, Pence denied that as well, despite the fact that--during a televised interview on MSNBC's Morning Joe--Trump said exactly that. ""You're going to have a deportation force, and you're going to do it humanely,"" said the Republican presidential nominee, of removing immigrants from the country. And when Kaine hit Trump for backing punishment against women who have abortions, Mike Pence widened his eyes in disbelief, denying that this was on the table for the GOP leader. ""Donald Trump and I would never support legislation that punished women who made the heartbreaking choice to end a pregnancy."" Again, Trump said this. On television. ""Do you believe in punishment for abortion, yes or no as a principle?"" Chris Matthews asked of Trump during a town hall with voters in Green Bay, Wisconsin. ""The answer is that there has to be some form of punishment."" Again and again and again, Tim Kaine confronted Mike Pence on statements from his running mate, and again and again, Pence either ignored them or denied them outright, shaking his head and giving the audience a look of smarmy incredulity, as if Kaine were reading couplets from the Necronomicon. At a certain point, Pence even doubled down on the idea that Hillary Clinton had run an offensive, insult-driven campaign. ""I mean, to be honest with you, if Donald Trump had said all of the things that you've said he said in the way you said he said them,"" Pence said, ""he still wouldn't have a fraction of the insults that Hillary Clinton leveled when she said that half of our supporters were a 'basket of deplorables.' "" We don't know Pence's mental state. Maybe he wasn't lying. Maybe he had never heard Trump's words or statements. But we do know that Pence is a living, breathing person with a vested stake in this presidential election. And we know that, since the summer, he has been an intimate part of the Republican campaign, following Trump's behavior and accounting for his missteps. We know that, before he was picked for the ticket, Pence criticized Trump for some of the rhetoric he now denies (specifically, the ban on Muslim entry to the United States), and we know that Pence himself said words that he later denied to Tim Kaine and the debate audience. Mike Pence was better at this debate. He was smoother, more polished. More confident. And for 90 minutes, he used that polish and confidence to deny Trump's rhetoric and behavior and gaslight the country that has borne witness to them. To call this winning is to act as if nothing matters. But vice presidents stand a real chance of sitting in the Oval Office. It matters. If Pence ""won,"" it's because he denied the truth even existed. Maybe this was a preview of what will happen if the Republican nominee loses his race for the presidency. There won't be recriminations or questions. The GOP won't have to answer for anything. Instead, Republican leaders like Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz--and even Mike Pence--will shake their heads and give looks of smarmy incredulity and pretend as if nothing happened, as if they didn't support a white nationalist's bid for the world's most important elected office.

I guess you're interested in the vice presidential debate between Tim Kaine and Mike Pence, which airs Tuesday night. Are you sure you wouldn't rather go out and see Storks, which stars the voices of Jennifer Aniston, Ty Burrell, Katie Crown, Stephen Kramer Glickman, Kelsey Grammer, Keegan-Michael Key, Jordan Peele, Andy Samberg, and Danny Trejo? OK, we won't judge. This debate is not likely to matter very much--it's not going to change anyone's mind--but it could be interesting. Kaine and Pence are both men of faith, and they may end up discussing some of the cultural issues (abortion, gay marriage, Storks) that were passed over at the first presidential debate. Kaine has been quiet on the campaign trail; for many voters, this will be the only time they spend more than 30 seconds thinking about him. Pence is likely tasked with making Trump's outrageous behavior seem palatable to grown-ups. Pundits and politicos will be watching closely. Below are their live tweets, drawn from a list of top accounts curated by Slate. Those who lean left are on the left; those who lean right are on the right. Enjoy the instant spin.

22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/stop_pining_for_joe_biden.html	"As someone who believes that Hillary Clinton still has the capacity to lose the 2016 election to an off-balance demagogue, I am sympathetic to the view that almost any other Democratic nominee, from Elizabeth Warren to possibly even Bernie Sanders, would be doing better in the polls. This would certainly be the case had Vice President Joe Biden decided to run and had he won the Democratic nomination. And yet every time I think about Biden as the nominee, and then presumably as the president of the United States, I wince. There is something absurd about the idea of Joe Biden being the most powerful person on Earth, an absurdity that cannot be wished away no matter how hard you try. There are really two Joe Bidens, and it can be difficult to reconcile them. The first is the Biden most voters recognize, the ""Uncle Joe"" figure who tells stories about his mother, talks endlessly about riding the train from Delaware to Washington, and delights in what he would surely call the ""nitty-gritty"" of politics. He is liable to lightly curse, and to tell the same anecdote more than once, in both cases due to a surplus of enthusiasm many find charming. Biden is so routinely off-message, and so demonstratively emotional, that this side of his personality may well be genuine. Then there is the other side of Biden, the calculating politician who has been a player in Washington for decades and has very different values than the average Joes to whom he pitches his appeal. (Like Biden, I am assuming that average, hardworking Americans--to coin a phrase--are entirely noble and decent.) Joe Biden is a man who plagiarized numerous politicians in speeches back in the 1980s. He is someone who claimed the personal details from the British politician Neil Kinnock's life story as his own, including tales of relatives who would play football after a long day working in a coal mine. (How fortunate for Biden that the English also play a game called ""football."") More recently, Biden leaked his son's deathbed words to Maureen Dowd, in the service of giving steam to his political ambitions, which revolved around a possible run for the Democratic nomination against Clinton. As the latest example of the apparent contradiction between Biden the everyman and Biden the blindly ambitious pol, look no further than Jason Zengerle's highly enjoyable interview with him in the latest edition of New York. The Q&A has some of the typical Biden trademarks that people profess to find attractive: There's a story about having some dubious bit of Senate wisdom passed down to him by an old hand. (""Joe, it's always appropriate to question another man or woman's judgment. It's never appropriate to question their motive, because you simply don't know what their motive is."") There's cliched wisdom he delivers as if it's his own insight. (""By the way, my view is, all politics is personal."") There is his Trump-like faith in his own ability to negotiate, particularly with former colleagues on the Hill. (I urge people to read Noam Scheiber's account of Biden's willingness to give away too much during the ""fiscal cliff"" negotiations for a corrective to this view.) And, finally, there are his warm words for opponents across the aisle. (Biden may be the only person in Washington who ""misses"" Eric Cantor.) Then along comes Biden the aggrandizer and burnisher of his own image. He seems to want to bask in the glow of Obama's legacy--""The great advantage I had with the president is, substantively, we've agreed on everything,"" he tells Zengerle--and at the same time to carve out for himself a healthy measure of the glory. A little later in the interview, he allows that he and the president didn't quite agree on everything: ""When I had strong disagreements, I reserved that for the Oval Office. We have raised our voice with one another, we have had real disagreements, and I must say, I believe that we'll see what he writes, but the record will show I had a lot more influence on getting the position I wanted. I strongly opposed going into Libya. I strongly opposed the moving from counterterrorism and counterinsurgency under Petraeus in Afghanistan. It turned out that, if you look, I think I've been right."" What's particularly laughable about such claims is that he is citing as evidence of his influence ... debates he lost. He wants credit both for reserving his opinion for the president, and for telling us those opinions now and saying he was right and the president was wrong. What loyalty! It's hard to avoid the sense that Biden's addiction to homespun notions of loyalty--not to mention his penchant for any sort of tired, received wisdom--is something he uses in the service of his persona, not as a guiding political philosophy. Biden must have some awareness of the contradiction; he's self-conscious enough, in the interview, to speak of his ""brand,"" which, apparently, is straight-talk. The gap between reputation and behavior is a familiar, and persistent, one with Biden: This is the reputed foreign policy expert who opposed the Gulf War, supported the Iraq invasion, opposed the surge, and then convinced the White House, calamitously, to back Nouri al-Maliki's government during Obama's first term. And this is his record on one of his pet issues! None of this is to say Biden is any worse than most politicians. He probably isn't. But the adulation he receives from Democrats is unearned, and the unthinking way in which the party faithful buy into his straight-talker brand is undeserved. Yes, Biden would probably be crushing Trump in polls today, but it is far from a tragedy that he will never be president, even if he is a heckuva guy."

23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/are_things_really_as_bad_as_trump_and_clinton_make_it_seem.html	"This article appears in slightly different form in the Financial Times. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton agreed about almost nothing in their first presidential debate, but on one point their views seemed strangely harmonious. Neither of them chose to describe anything resembling a bright future for the U.S. Trump's pessimism is calculated and demagogic rather than visceral. His first statement in the debate was about jobs ""fleeing the country"" for Mexico. As many real-time fact-checkers were quick to point out, the U.S economy has added 14.9 million jobs since the bottom of the recession in 2010. For the rest of the evening, the truth squads were kept busy by Trump's grim blend of the untrue and the unverifiable. The U.S., he said, is being robbed by every other country in the world while being destroyed from within by illegal immigrants, crime, disorder, and terrorism. He didn't use his familiar line that, ""our country is going to hell,"" but everything he said amounted to the same point. To some extent, the party out-of-office has to argue that conditions are terrible. Why else demand a change in direction? What is more surprising is that Clinton, who represents continuity with a relatively popular president and a strong economy, has not done a better job of conveying optimism. Since Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in 1980, the one thing every politician knows for certain is that sunny defeats cloudy. Versions of Reagan's optimism were baked into the slogans of Bill Clinton in 1992 (""Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow"") and Barack Obama in 2008 (""Hope"" and ""Yes We Can!"") Clinton's chief slogan, ""I'm With Her,"" lacks any resonance of Reagan's ""Morning in America"". Its absence speaks to her limitations as a politician. Clinton is a master of policy but finds herself challenged in weaving her proposals into an affirming vision or narrative. For her, the word ""future"" triggers banal comments about her grandchildren. And given the vileness of her opponent, she has inevitably run a highly negative campaign. The bipartisan dourness also reflects the pervasive mood in the U.S. At the time of the Republican convention in July, a mere 17 percent of people were satisfied with the way things were going in the country, according to Gallup. That number has ticked up slightly, but people still say that America is on the wrong track by a margin of more than 2 to 1. Economic statistics paint a far rosier picture. The Census Bureau recently reported that household income grew by 5.2 percent in 2015--the largest single-year increase since 1967. For a change, those gains were widely shared; 3.5 million people rose above the poverty line, which is also a post-1960s record. The unemployment rate stands at 5 percent, a level last seen in 2008. A strong dollar and near-record stock market levels reflect the age of technological miracles and wonders in which we live. American companies are leading the way in robotics, drones, driverless cars, space exploration, stem-cell therapies, and more. Other social metrics look even more positive. Violent crime has been declining steadily for 25 years. The Affordable Care Act wants amendment but has already been responsible for lowering the share of Americans without health insurance from 16 percent to 9 percent. In 2010, 496 American soldiers died fighting in Afghanistan. So far in 2016, the number killed in action is one. And relative to other countries, the position of the U.S. looks even better. That it remains the destination of choice for immigrants around the world requires little explanation. If things are going so well, why then is the mood so sour? In part, the negative numbers convey anxiety about societal upheaval, especially on the part of those at risk of losing out. Less-educated white men who are Trump's core supporters are much more likely to say that the country's best days are behind it. The automatic advantages attached to whiteness are declining, and because fewer and fewer unskilled jobs can support a middle-class standard of living, they face painful economic dislocation. Younger African Americans and Latinos are far more optimistic. So long as they can obtain post-secondary education, their prospects are vastly brighter than those of previous generations. Hyperbolic pessimism also flows from the paradox of rising standards, by which reform makes problems look worse just when they are changing for the better. Unjustified police shootings of black men are anything but a new phenomenon in the U.S. Evidence from cell phone videos, a national outcry about the issue, and the possibility of punishment for perpetrators are the novelties. There is a growing consensus against mass incarceration and other long-accepted forms of racial injustice. A parallel awakening about sex abuse and gender discrimination is making the formerly tolerated intolerable. None of this is to deny the seriousness of problems ranging from middle-class income stagnation, to neglected infrastructure, to endemic gun violence. But stepping back, it looks as if the country is mainly suffering from an extended funk over the financial crisis combined with unease about rapid social and technological change. We optimists know that the pessimists will always get more intellectual respect. But are things really so bad after all? Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

Despite--or perhaps because of--our extreme differences of opinion, I've always enjoyed talking politics with him. Given the recent spate of conservative pundits and newspapers endorsing Hillary Clinton, I'd been wondering if Jonah, now a columnist for National Review, USA Today, and the Los Angeles Times, had pondered doing the same. So I emailed him. Our edited exchange is below. Seth Stevenson: You've said that living in Washington, D.C., gives you some relief from worrying about how to cast your vote, since the result there is not in doubt. But you still have a big platform that you could use to endorse a candidate. Given your distaste for Donald Trump, have you given any thought to urging your readers to vote for Hillary Clinton? Jonah Goldberg: I have given some thought to endorsing Hillary Clinton, and every time I do I recoil in horror for many of the same reasons I recoil from the prospect of endorsing Trump. They are different people with different strengths and weaknesses, but both are flatly unacceptable to me. My position in all this is really rather simple. I've never much cared about the idea that I might influence voters one way or the other. We think about that kind of thing institutionally at National Review, of course. But as an independent writer, I've always thought playing those sorts of games was corrupting. I see my job as telling the truth as I see it. Hillary Clinton will be bad for America. Donald Trump will be bad for America. I could spend a lot of time and energy trying to figure out which one would be worse--and I have many thoughts on the topic which I'm happy to share--but no matter how that question resolved itself, it wouldn't change the fact that both are unacceptably bad. At least for me, I think it's better to be honest and straightforward about that and let the chips fall where they may. Many conservatives--including many friends and fans--don't like that answer because they think I have to bend the knee to some abstract binary: If I'm not for Trump that means I'm for Hillary. This seems to me a confusion of the logic of voting (which itself is pretty faulty, voters have other options) for the obligations of a writer or analyst. Ted Cruz, before his prostration, told conservatives to vote their conscience. I'm going to speak my conscience. When given a choice between two crap sandwiches on different kinds of bread, my response is ""I'll skip lunch""--and then I'll tell you why. OK, let me dig into some of this. It seems the reason some conservative pundits and editorial boards are endorsing Hillary is that they view Trump as an existential threat to the republic. Sure, the logic goes, Hillary is a liberal who will be very bad for the country in a run-of-the-mill way. But Trump is an outlier, a genuine danger to our democracy, uniquely unfit due to his temperament and lack of qualification. There is an element of genuine fear about what might happen under Trump. Does that argument not sway you at all? I don't dismiss that argument. I think a President Trump would strain the constitutional system the same way he tested the GOP party apparatus. I would expect a President Trump to give orders that violate the Constitution, and then we would have to see whether the system could respond adequately. Remember how he used to insist that he would bring back waterboarding and ""a hell of a lot worse"" tactics? When it was pointed out to him that military officers would be required to refuse unlawful orders, he said, in effect, ""Oh, they'll obey!"" He later backtracked, but I think it's clear his instincts are utterly uninformed by constitutional norms. I hear a lot of Republicans telling me that they will manage President Trump, box him in, etc. I am extremely skeptical about the idea that President Trump will be more manageable than candidate Trump once he gets Air Force One. So, again, I think it's a legitimate concern. But, I think it's also very clear that President Hillary Clinton would have contempt for the Constitution just as Obama has (see Yuval Levin and Ramesh Ponnuru's recent piece on this point). One could even make the case that she's the greater danger on this front. The legal establishment, the bureaucracy, the media et al. will all either explicitly come to her aid or they will provide respectable cover, just as they did for Obama's unilateral executive orders. One of the best things about a Trump presidency--shudder--might just be how he would elicit a healthy antibody response, forcing a new commitment to separation of powers. I'm not making the case for voting for Trump here, I think he could be a very, very dangerous president (particularly on the economy and foreign policy). What I'm saying is that America is a bit like the proverbial frog in the pot. Hillary would incrementally turn up the heat, which is at near-boil, while Trump would start at the boiling point. But let me jump ahead and just answer the question I think you're really getting at. I think in the short term there is a very good argument that Hillary would be worse for America than Trump. My chief worry, among many, is that Trump would be worse in the long term because he threatens to destroy modern American conservatism. We can already see how Trump is basically refashioning conservatism (I would say ""corrupting""). If Trump comes out for X, within minutes people who've spent decades opposed to X suddenly turn on a dime and start cheerleading for X. (See, e.g. Gingrich on NAFTA and NATO, Mike Pence on everything.) A bunch of very smart conservatives have allowed themselves to be seduced by a very dumb idea. Specifically, they think that this problem will get better once he's elected president. It won't. It will get much, much, much worse. Once in office, I could very easily see him getting rolled by the bureaucracy and basically become a big government Nixonite (which is what he is in his heart already). Or, the GOP will become a nationalist party instead of a sort of Toryish/classical liberal party. It will become protectionist, pro-authoritarian, and dirigiste. There's already a lot of that in the Democratic Party, but a Trumpified GOP will stop offering an alternative to that and instead starting a bidding war on everything from entitlements to infrastructure spending. And I'm not even addressing the extent to which the GOP would fully surrender to leftist categories of thinking when it comes to identity politics--only in reverse. I'm against identity politics full stop, which means I'm against white identity politics at least as much as I'm against minority identity politics. In sum, my biggest fear--or at least the fear I am most confident about--is that he will break the already-strained spine of limited government constitutionalism and classical liberalism in such a way that there will no longer be any check on the administrative state. America can survive four years of Hillary Clinton, it can't survive a political system divided by Sanders-style socialists and Trump-style nationalists. But because I want my kind of conservatism to survive, I don't think it makes any sense for me to endorse Hillary Clinton, who is open and honest about her contempt for my kind of conservatism. I want to be able to say five, 10, 20 years from now, ""These are the things I believe,"" without someone saying, ""Oh yeah? Then why did you support Clinton or Trump?"" You don't hear a lot of people demanding that prominent libertarians choose between the lesser of two evils. I just can't support either of these people. (Much like National Review couldn't endorse Kennedy or Nixon--neither met the minimal standards for Bill Buckley's understanding of conservatism.) You are essentially making the same argument I hear 500 times a day from conservatives. They say, ""If Hillary wins America is over."" You're saying (or suggesting), ""If Trump wins, America is over."" I have more faith in America and our system of government. Indeed, if we really are at a place where America's survival hinges on a single election of a single officeholder for one branch of one of our governments, then America is already over. Because that's not what America is. I still sense a vast difference in amplitude here, though. Even if we stipulate that Hillary might use executive orders regarding, say, immigration or guns in ways that conservatives find unconstitutional, is that really equivalent to the concerns surrounding Trump--a trade war resulting in massive economic shock, an impulsive attitude toward foreign relations that ramps up the danger of sudden armed conflict, etc? I hear you when you say America is resilient, but aren't the downside risks MUCH, MUCH more extreme with Trump? They very well might be.

25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/donald_trump_is_half_a_florida_man.html	"On Sept. 19, Donald Trump's campaign passed through Fort Myers, Florida, on the Gulf Coast. ""Oh boy, what a crowd,"" the candidate marveled as he stepped on stage. ""And outside, we have many more people than this outside. It's incredible, incredible. Really incredible. Thank you very much, and it's great to be back in Florida, my second home, as you know."" Something bigger was afoot that afternoon than a wealthy New Yorker returning to his pied-a-terre. This was the craziest election in history returning to its spiritual home--Florida--where it could pay homage to its central totem: Florida Man. As you have probably heard via Twitter, Reddit, or various aggregation sites, Florida Man is a popular meme--""the world's worst superhero,"" who takes the blame for all the bizarre and jaw-droppingly stupid behavior committed by certain members of the state's populace. His exploits are legendary. Examples abound, but let me just cite a recent one: ""Florida Man Arrested for Illegal Ride on Manatee."" The 2016 presidential election is the Florida Man of elections, and with good reason. At one point there were four Florida Men in the running, plus one part-timer. Former Gov. Jeb Bush and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, you knew about. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee moved into a $3 million waterfront home in the Florida Panhandle in 2010, and Dr. Ben Carson retired to a golf course community in West Palm Beach in 2013. You can easily tell they're Florida Men: constantly committing gaffes, perpetually trying to explain their unsavory associates, doing their best to avoid questions about their finances, struggling to put on hoodies the wrong way, hitting kids in the face with footballs. The rest of America was amazed. Floridians just shrugged. Florida has never spawned a president. Instead it tends to thwart presidential hopes and dreams. A Florida man named Lewis Powell took part in the conspiracy to assassinate Abraham Lincoln--and of course bungled his assignment. He was caught and made to pose for an early version of Florida Man portraiture, a police mugshot. The Watergate burglars were Bay of Pigs veterans who were recruited from Florida. Florida reporters caught 1988 Democratic front-runner Gary Hart engaging in monkey business on a like-named boat with a Miami ""actress,"" derailing his campaign. And who could forget the 2000 election debacle that guaranteed no one in Florida would name a child ""Chad"" for the next 20 years? When it came time to vote in the Florida GOP primary, the winner was the part-time Florida resident, one Donald J. Trump. By that point he'd already chased three of the others from the race, including the former governor; then in the state primary he swamped the last man standing, the one he'd sneered at as ""Little Marco."" This led the Associated Press to ask: ""Is Trump the quintessential Florida Man?"" After all, he has a legacy of business bankruptcies, not to mention lawsuits galore alleging fraud, and a habit of saying things that don't match up with the truth. There's also his history of marital and extramarital relations, not a problem for a state that once elected a congressman, Richard Kelly, who got married for the fifth time not long before going to prison over the Abscam scandal. The woman had been the wife of one of his character witnesses in his trial. Trump's part-time Florida home, Mar-a-Lago, is a showplace, quite in keeping with a state where the most recognizable piece of architecture is a sumptuous castle that nobody lives in (not even the nominal owner, Cinderella). In 1985, Trump paid $10 million for the 58-bedroom mansion and its 20-acre oceanfront estate. He then turned it into a ritzy club, offending his neighbors. Among his guests over the years: the Seminole tribe's Chief James Billie, who put on an alligator-wrestling exhibition. Offending the neighbors is a popular pastime in Florida. But I'd take points off because his many feuds with his Florida neighbors have mostly involved the use of lawyers, not machetes or samurai swords. Although he's best known as a developer--certainly the perfect job title for a Florida Man--down here his big business is golf. He owns three golf courses here: Doral, Palm Beach, and Jupiter. That also puts him in the mainstream for Florida, which boasts more holes of golf than any other state. Florida is so identified with golf that it's the home of the Professional Golfers Association of America. It's also where Caddyshack was filmed. Last year, Golf.com declared Florida ""the golfiest state."" It was at Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter that Corey Lewandowski, his then-campaign manager, grabbed the arm of Breitbart's Michelle Fields and yanked her away as she asked him questions. Lewandowski was first charged with battery, and then the charges were dropped. Trump initially denied anything had happened, then suggested that Lewandowski was right to do whatever he did because the reporter's pen ""could have been a little bomb."" Such an extreme effort at coming up with an oddball excuse for Lewandowski's behavior is truly a classic slice of Florida Man, reminiscent of the Florida man who in 2015 tried to get out of a DUI charge by telling the cops, ""My dog was driving that car."" Such paranoia--about bomb pens!--is also in keeping with the Sunshine State psyche, given that we lead the nation in concealed weapons permits, as well as in gun-related accidents. Meanwhile our ""Stand Your Ground"" law (written by an National Rifle Association lobbyist who's a grandmother in her 70s and backed by both Rubio and Bush) has been copied by lots of other states. And yet, there is one thing that guarantees Trump will never be a full-fledged Florida Man. It's his signature issue, immigration. His campaign has been built on his promise to keep Mexicans out with a wall and Muslims out with an immigration ban. Florida, meanwhile, doesn't just thrive on immigrants; it actually requires them. Although our first state flag in 1845 bore the slogan ""Let Us Alone,"" Florida's economy depends on new people showing up. It's been that way ever since Uncle Tom's Cabin author Harriet Beecher Stowe moved here after the Civil War and virtually invented Florida's tourism industry. Stowe's own home on the St. John's River was one of our first tourist attractions. Florida's economy is not unlike a Ponzi scheme. (Appropriately, Charles Ponzi, the inventor of the Ponzi scheme, worked his scam in Boston, was caught, then moved to Florida and got involved in a real estate fraud.) Florida relies on an unending parade of new suckers bringing in more money. Otherwise the whole thing folds up like an empty wallet. That influx is why Florida surpassed Trump's New York to become the third most populous state in 2014. A lot of the people who moved to Florida in the past were from within the U.S, particularly the chilly Northern states where there's an income tax, something Florida got rid of in the 1920s. More recently, Puerto Rico's financial woes drove a lot of the island's residents to move to the Orlando area. These days, though, a lot of the people snapping up Florida real estate are from somewhere outside the U.S. They're from South America, or from China, or one of the countries known for having a large population of Muslims. Instead of telling them to get out and stay out, as Trump would do, Floridians have welcomed them--and their money--with open arms. A true Florida Man would not build a wall. A Florida Man says, ""Come on down, no matter who you are and where you came from, and bring your cash and credit cards!"""

26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/is_anyone_buying_donald_trump_s_debate_impression_of_a_small_government.html	"So what exactly will be the upshot of Monday night's presidential debate? Did Donald Trump establish that he is the change agent that America desperately needs and that his command of policy detail is more than adequate? Did Hillary Clinton dismantle Trump, clearly demonstrating to millions of television viewers that he's an empty suit? Did either candidate do anything to change the minds of some among the unusually large number of undecided voters who've made this year's presidential polls so volatile? My sense is that the debate helped Clinton a bit more than it helped Trump. Why is that? I'm sorry to say that my reasoning is embarrassingly simple. To the surprise of many observers, this year's presidential election has wound up looking awfully familiar. Democratic voters are largely consolidating behind Clinton, and Republican voters are largely consolidating behind Trump. There are some quirks this year, however. Minor party candidates are playing a much bigger role than they have in years. Both Gary Johnson and Jill Stein have large followings among disaffected younger voters, a development that is proving costly for Clinton. Trump's problem is different. To win, he doesn't just need Johnson and Stein to retain voters who might otherwise vote for Clinton. He needs to win over Republican holdouts. In past elections, Republicans could rely on the support of large numbers of college-educated suburban professionals, and in particular the married white women among them. But Trump's coalition is quite different. Relative to a typical Republican, Trump fares quite a bit better among non-college-educated white men. Yet these gains seem to have been canceled out by losses among women, college-educated and non-college-educated, and college-educated men. My colleague Eliana Johnson, the Washington editor of National Review, often argues that the most crucial voters in this election will be married white women in Pennsylvania. This might be a slight overstatement. Married white women in, say, Colorado will probably be important as well. But there is no question that married white women have been a weakness for Trump, in sharp contrast to Mitt Romney. If Trump did nothing but try to woo married white women in swing states between now and November, it would be time well spent. And that's why Trump fell short on Monday night. Constantly interrupting Clinton and painting an apocalyptic portrait of the state of American life might have pleased his adoring fans, who love him for his forceful presence. The trouble is that we've long known that Trump is supremely confident and that he has no qualms about bulldozing over others. To surpass Clinton, Trump needed to do more than just buck up his fans. He needed to reach reluctant Republican-leaning women who have serious misgivings about his character and temperament. By confronting him with his derogatory remarks about women, I'm guessing Clinton heightened these concerns more than Trump succeeded in allaying them. With his celebrity status and his unconventional style, you'd think Trump would have done more to scramble the electorate. There are signs that he has tried to do just that--by wooing Bernie Sanders voters, by railing against foreign wars and foreign entanglements, and by embracing economic populism. Over the past few weeks, Trump has called for the creation of a new taxpayer-funded maternity-leave benefits program and he's told Dr. Oz that he's all for expanding Medicaid, and both stances have earned him jeers from small-government conservatives. On criminal justice, Trump has been running to Clinton's right by emphasizing law-and-order themes. But every now and again, he's tried swinging to her left, e.g., by criticizing her in Monday night's debate for using the term superpredator to refer to violent young offenders (or, in Trump's phrase, ""young black youth""). Yet Trump largely steered clear of heterodoxy. When Clinton raised questions about what Trump might be hiding in his undisclosed tax returns, and whether he has paid any federal income taxes at all, Trump said essentially that any federal taxes he'd pay would have been wasted--a hard line to square with his defense of Social Security and Medicaid and his support for a new program for working mothers. But that contradiction never really came up, because Trump did little to advertise his departures from small-government conservatism. Apart from condemning trade agreements for their alleged role in devastating American industry, he mostly stuck to tried-and-true conservative nostrums, like calling for lower taxes and deregulation to stimulate growth. Instead of scrambling the electorate, Trump is just scrambling to get Republican voters to come home. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/donald_trump_s_genius_for_improvisation_finally_failed_him_at_the_hofstra.html	Donald Trump likes to freestyle. In his overheated, screwball way, he's a master of the form. His improvisational skills are pretty much the core of his appeal--he's not scripted, he's good television. His faith in his ability to let it rip is the essence of his swagger, which apparently appeals to a vast audience. There aren't many people who can pull it off, and it has worked far better than anyone could possibly have imagined. Monday night, however, his improvisational skills failed him--and he slammed up against the limits of his political talents. He came into the debate with a reasonable strategy: Talk about trade and narrowcast his message to the three Rust Belt swing states that could snake him past 270. The script held for nearly 10 minutes, but he didn't have much of a strategy beyond that opening riff. Without a considered plan--without canned lines, without prepared counterattacks, without secondary talking points--he found himself constantly on the defensive. More often than not, the subject shifted to Trump and his record. The evening summed to a fairly comprehensive review of the opposition research file on the man, though there wasn't enough time to get to Trump University or his so-called charitable foundation. Even Trump's talent for improvisation was challenged. Answers that could have been easily anticipated by a disciplined candidate were occasions for incoherent free association. Hillary, on the other hand, found herself only slightly dinged on the email issue--and even then, she had only to fight off the lazy man's inarticulate version of the case against her. In the past, Trump has done a passable job working his way out of jams. His approach usually involves a few lines of bluster, a few fudges of truth, and a bull rush to change the subject. Trump does a good job of talking over interviewers and his opponents, running down the clock. That strategy works fine on a phoned-in interview to a Sunday-morning show or in a primary debate with a full stage of politicians clamoring for attention. But it wasn't up to this challenge. Lester Holt may not be the most forceful interlocutor in the history of journalism, but he gently pressed Trump on birtherism and taxes. His questions permitted Clinton enough time and space to corner him on these issues. Throughout the night, she did a good job of pivoting from broader policy questions to his personal weaknesses. Without a plan for controlling the debate, Trump failed to get to some of core issues. He has made immigration a cornerstone of his campaign, yet he only managed to get to the subject at the very end of the evening and only in passing. He never got around to mentioning the Clinton Foundation or any of his other rote attacks on Clinton's character. Improvisation isn't just Trump's go-to strategy; it's his go-to excuse, and a weak one. Did he initially support the Iraq war? Well, he was just gabbing without thinking, when he said that on The Howard Stern Show. What about his criticisms of NATO? Those comments were made without much forethought, he said. Unfortunately, the remarks managed to scare the hell out of our allies. Half-baked comments on hair-trigger subjects aren't so easy to take back. Monday night Trump flailed badly with lame efforts to rebottle those riffs as brassy politics. Much of the past month, Trump has tried to leave behind his seat-of-the-pants style. More accurately, Kellyanne Conway has managed to shove him into the political equivalent of a padded room. He's been tethered to the teleprompter; his handlers have limited his paroxysms of tweets. Conway's instincts were, of course, profoundly correct. Monday night, on his own on stage for 90 minutes, Trump had nothing to fall back on but his instincts, and he improvised his way to infamy.

28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/09/what_trump_means_when_he_talks_about_stop_and_frisk.html	"Midway through the first presidential debate of the 2016 election, moderator Lester Holt asked Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump to tackle the racial divide. How would they bridge the gap between Americans with vastly different experiences of the country? Hillary Clinton went first and gave an answer that played to her strengths. She turned the conversation toward criminal justice reform and emphasized new training and techniques for police officers. She promised to ""bring communities together"" and encourage mutual respect between police departments and the publics they serve. And she pledged to take guns off the streets and out of the hands of criminals. Her underlying assumptions weren't always correct--to talk about restoring trust between black communities and police is to assume trust was there to begin with--but she tackled the subject at hand. Trump didn't. Instead, he moved to more comfortable territory. ""Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words and that's 'law and order.' And we need law and order. If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country."" From here, he moved into his now-typical appeal to black voters. ""We have a situation where we have our inner cities--African Americans, Hispanics are living in hell because it's so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot."" He ended this riff with a declaration: that cities like Chicago needed stop-and-frisk to make them safe. He was thrumming the big home chord of his campaign--the idea that there should be two sets of laws in America, one for white people and one for everyone else. If you've followed this election at all--and if you aren't sympathetic to the Republican nominee--you've probably experienced ""Trump fatigue,"" the feeling of exhaustion that comes with tracking the twists and turns of Donald Trump's dishonesty, his incoherence, his outrageous rhetoric. But Trump fatigue doesn't matter because of its effect on journalists and their emotional lives; it matters because it shapes coverage. When everything is an outrage--when everything is an untruth or a distortion--then nothing is. And we miss those words and statements that do matter. Here, at the debate, was rhetoric that mattered. As president, Trump would try to revive a program deemed unconstitutional. And this wasn't the first time he's said as much. Last week, he gestured at outreach to black Americans with a town hall, hosted by Sean Hannity of Fox News. It was everything you would expect, including Trump's misleading and tendentious depiction of black life in the United States. ""Now, I have to say, the crime is just beyond anything--it's worse than Afghanistan,"" said Trump. The town hall continued this way, with Trump (and Hannity) spinning to a largely white audience a twisted and distorted picture of black communities that eventually flowed into an endorsement of stop-and-frisk. ""Well, one of the things I'd do ... is I would do stop-and-frisk,"" said Trump, in response to a question about ""black-on-black crime."" ""I think you have to. We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well, and you have to be proactive, and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind."" Trump later explicitly endorsed stop-and-frisk for Chicago. The larger idea, that this was necessary for order, went unchallenged. It's easy to treat this enthusiasm for stop-and-frisk as just another instance of Trump's ignorance. He doesn't know that it's unconstitutional. He doesn't know that it wasn't responsible for New York City's safer streets. But it's more than that. With his rhetoric of law and order at the debate and at the town hall, Trump underlined the core conceit of his candidacy: that people of color--either citizens or otherwise--are the principal threat to the United States. It's worth a moment to say that Trump is wrong about stop-and-frisk. Introduced to New York City under Mayor Rudy Giuliani, stop-and-frisk was vastly expanded under his successor, Michael Bloomberg. The idea was that, through arbitrary stops and detentions, you would take guns and offenders off the street. The reality, according to data collected by the New York Civil Liberties Union, is that there's almost no evidence to tie stop-and-frisk to the decline of violent crime in New York, which began before Giuliani's administration and has continued to the present, even after a federal judge declared the practice unconstitutional in 2013. That last point is important. Stop-and-frisk was ineffective, but that's not why it was challenged in court. Stop-and-frisk was challenged because it was used almost exclusively against blacks and Latinos, as a method of sanctioned intimidation. Elected officials like then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg shrugged, arguing that this was necessary. ""I think we disproportionately stop whites too much and minorities too little. It's exactly the reverse of what they say,"" said Bloomberg in 2013, even as nonwhites made up 80 to 90 percent of all stops. The argument in favor of this was crime; if most perpetrators of violent crime are young black and Latino men, then the police should target them. The problem is obvious: Most perpetrators of violent crime in New York might be young black and Latino men, but the vast majority of young black and Latino aren't involved in crime. To treat them as presumptively criminal is to ignore factors outside of age and race that actually do contribute to violence. It's noteworthy that when police stopped whites, they were twice more likely to find weapons, a sign that a trained and discerning eye could identify possible offenders without racial profiling. New York City under stop-and-frisk was a place where people of color, and men of color in particular, could be detained for belonging to a class that had been deemed suspect. And Trump sees that as a model for dealing with violent crime in Chicago and wherever else it flares up. In practice, it's hard to imagine how a President Trump would accomplish this expansion of stop-and-frisk. The practice, again, is unconstitutional, to say nothing of the fact that local police practice falls far outside the White House's jurisdiction. But whether Trump's plan is feasible is less important than what this new plank says about his larger agenda. What does Trump want for the country? He wants a wall on the Mexican border and a massive expansion of federal immigration enforcement, to remove millions of ""illegal"" immigrants from the country. He wants a ban on Muslim refugees to the United States as a ""matter of quality of life"" as well as a precaution against terrorism, and he wants a larger ban on any travelers from ""dangerous regions"" (read: Muslims). He wants greater surveillance of Muslim communities and religious institutions. He wants to expand stop-and-frisk to other cities, and his vice presidential nominee--Indiana Gov. Mike Pence--believes we spend too much time talking about ""institutional bias or racism within law enforcement."" These plans are instructive, even as they lack for detail. They provide a vision of Donald Trump's America. It's a country where a new deportation force is empowered to scour the land for unauthorized immigrants and remove them as a matter of course. It's one where Muslims are under constant suspicion and surveillance. It's one where millions of black Americans are deprived of key constitutional rights under a regime that treats them as presumptively criminal and turns a blind eye to bias in policing and law enforcement. It is, with no exaggeration, an America where whites receive the legal and cultural benefit of the doubt, and nonwhites are held guilty or complicit until proven otherwise.
