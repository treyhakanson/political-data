But it never hurts to get a head start. In his first speech after the spill, President Obama dumped responsibility on BP. And in the public mind, BP is still the main culprit, with 76 percent of Americans disapproving of the way the company is handling the spill. But as more information trickles out about what went wrong and how disaster might have been averted, the arguments over who to blame are becoming fully formed. Here's a look at where fingers have been pointing, and why: BP: As the lease-holder of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, BP bears ultimate legal responsibility for the cleanup. It will also have to pay damages. But how much responsibility does it bear for the explosion itself? The argument for the buck stopping at BP's feet is that the company was in charge, so it should have demanded the strongest safety standards possible. For example, BP could have demanded an acoustic switch that shuts off the well when the rig is damaged--a safety measure that's required in Norway and Brazil. Aggravating this narrative is BP's history of preventable disasters, including an explosion at a Texas refinery in 2005 and a leaky pipeline in Alaska in 2006. The Obama administration has also criticized BP for failing to act quickly or efficiently enough to clean up the spill and has demanded that it use a more environmentally friendly chemical dispersant. Transocean Ltd.: While BP leased the rig, Transocean owned and operated it--and was therefore responsible for the equipment functioning properly. If the explosion was caused by a failed blowout preventer--a valve that seals off the wellhead--then Transocean would have to answer for it. BP executives also point to Transocean's Emergency Response Manual, which says that Transocean is responsible for activities on the rig--and therefore accidents--and that BP was only there to ""assist."" Halliburton: Halliburton's job was to cement the base of the well. So to the extent that a poor cement job contributed to the spill, blame Halliburton. Shoddy cementing is common on oil rigs, but Halliburton executives told the Senate recently that they were simply following BP's instructions. Indeed, it appears that BP may have skimped on testing the strength of the cement before ordering Halliburton to apply it. Minerals Management Service: The federal agency in charge of regulating the oil and gas industry has been almost a parody of incompetence. It let industry officials fill out their own inspection sheets and then traced it over in pen, according to an inspector general's report. Inspectors accepted gifts, like tickets to sports events and pricey dinners, from oil companies. They watched porn on their work computers. (Perhaps they were simply researching the ""junk shot."") In at least one case, an investigator may have conducted an inspection while tripping on meth. Not to mention the exemption from environmental impact analysis given to the Deepwater Horizon drilling operation in 2009. (When MMS did assess it in 2007, it estimated that any oil spill wouldn't exceed 1,500 barrels total. The current leak is at least 5,000 barrels a day.) The Obama administration has slammed MMS for its ethical lapses and announced plans to dissolve the agency and replace it with two separate entities--one for regulation and one for revenues. George W. Bush: The Bush administration is to MMS as BP is to Transocean: It was in charge when oil industry regulation was relaxed, so the blame may fall to them. Environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. argues that Bush and former Vice President Dick Cheney staffed MMS with industry-friendly cronies who created the ""culture of ethical failure"" cited by an inspector general report. Sen. Chris Dodd made a similar point to Don Imus on Tuesday: ""To lay this at Obama's doorstep, in light of years and years of regulatory permissiveness when it comes to these kinds of operations occurring, it didn't occur in the last year and a half."" Barack Obama: Few blame the Obama administration for the spill itself. But many believe it could have done a better job responding. Democratic strategist Donna Brazile called the president's response ""not tough enough"" on BP. In a rare alliance, so did Sarah Palin. Scientists say the administration has failed to collect solid data on the spill's scope and damage. Other critics have called for the government to step in and fix everything. But as Coast Guard chief Thad Allen said: ""To push BP out of the way, it would raise the question, to replace them with what?"" Politically, the administration's decision to expand offshore drilling--without much talk of its dangers--sets it up for some share of the blame. But in a heated speech in the Rose Garden, Obama pre-emptively rebutted attempts to blame the current White House: ""From the day he took office as Interior secretary, Ken Salazar has recognized these problems and he's worked to solve them."" Congress: If members of Congress really wanted to prevent spills, they could have written legislation that required more safeguards (for example, the acoustic switch). They could have demanded better oversight by regulatory agencies. And of course they could have de-emphasized offshore drilling, which has boomed in the last decade. Congress also created the $75 million liability cap that's now causing headaches as part of a compromise after the Exxon Valdez spill. The might have considered the repercussions then instead of now. Circular firing squads tend to be self-canceling, as casual observers lose track of who accused whom of what. But the oil spill is unlikely to follow that path. Too much attention is being paid and the stakes are too high. More likely, this blame-a-thon will resemble the one that followed the financial crisis. The causes of the crash were complex and numerous. But Congress eventually settled on two: the banks and the regulators. Hence the Goldman Sachs auto-da-fe and the regulatory reform bill that will revamp the rules of Wall Street. Who will take the flak? As legal guardian of the spill--and with liability claims already totaling in the tens of millions--BP is already in the dog house. Unfortunately for Bush and Transocean and the rest, there's room for more. Like  Slate on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	BP? Halliburton? Obama? Whom should we blame for the oil spill in the Gulf?

1	1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/05/whats_the_matter_with_virginia_part_2.html	"On May 7 Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell appointed Fred Malek chairman of his Commission on Government Reform and Restructuring. McDonnell, a conservative Republican who assumed office in January, had achieved unwelcome national attention a month earlier when he declared April ""Confederate History Month"" without mentioning that the Confederates fought to preserve slavery (because, he explained to reporters, slavery did not rate as one of the issues ""most significant for Virginia""). Two months before that, McDonnell had issued an executive order banning discrimination in state government that pointedly removed Virginia's previous protections based on sexual orientation. McDonnell ended up backing down a little after his whitewash of the Confederacy and his revocation of civil rights protections for homosexuals stirred a predictable outcry from the African American and gay communities. (See ""What's The Matter With Virginia?"") But Jewish groups have been slow to protest the appointment of Malek, whose most noteworthy prior experience in government reorganization dates to 1971, when Malek was a 34-year-old special assistant to President Richard Nixon. At Nixon's request, Malek produced a memo denoting the number of Jews employed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Malek then arranged the demotion of at least four people with Jewish-sounding surnames. (He didn't actually know who was Jewish and who wasn't; he guessed based on their names.) It was the last recorded act of official anti-Semitism by the United States government. Why no outcry? ""Malek's defenders,"" explains Frederick Kunkle in the May 21 Washington Post, ""have said that he long ago apologized and atoned for his role in the Nixon-led inquisition."" This view is widely held within Washington. But it happens to be wrong. Malek long ago copped to writing the Jew-counting memo, but he never admitted to--indeed, he lied with theatrical indignation about--his role in punishing the offending Semites, proof of which quietly surfaced in Slate three years ago. Malek's fulfillment of Nixon's deranged request that he identify the ""Jewish cabal"" within the BLS was first reported by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein in their 1976 book,  The Final Days. In September 1988, shortly after Vice President George H.W. Bush (then running for president) installed Malek as deputy chairman of the Republican National Committee, Woodward and Walter Pincus published a follow-up of sorts in the Post. Two months after Malek had written his July 1971 memo, Woodward and Pincus wrote, two Jewish BLS officials named Peter Henle and Harold Goldstein had been ""ousted from their posts and moved to less visible positions in the Labor Department agency."" The piece cited some evidence suggesting that Malek had been involved in the reassignments but offered no proof. For instance, Woodward and Pincus reported the existence of, but were unable to obtain, a follow-up to Malek's Jew-counting memo. They related that a notation in the Nixon White House files (which then resided in the National Archives) stated that the follow-up memo (dated Sept. 8, 1971) was not publicly available because disclosing it ""would violate an individual's rights."" It was, Woodward and Pincus explained, being withheld at the request of lawyers for Nixon, who was still alive at the time. An unnamed ""knowledgeable source"" told Woodward and Pincus that Nixon's lawyers had gone through the files of former Nixon aides who were now working for the Bush campaign. One hundred and thirty-four documents relating to Malek had been withdrawn from public view. This Post story, merely by documenting Malek's Jew-count, forced Malek's resignation from the RNC. But both before and after he quit, Malek said he'd done nothing more than report to Nixon that the BLS housed 13 Jews. Asked whether he thought his Jew-count was appropriate, Malek said ""No,"" adding, ""When you are in the White House you get lots of directives that you don't agree with."" Later in the story, Malek characterized Nixon's fixation on a Jewish BLS cabal as ""ridiculous"" and ""nonsense."" Malek was more voluble about the demotions. ""In no way did I take part in moving anyone out of the BLS,"" he told Woodward and Pincus. Malek said he had no memory of writing any follow-up memo, and ""If I had even been peripherally involved or asked to alter someone's employment status I would have found it offensive and morally unacceptable, and I would have refused."" Malek quit the day the Post story appeared, denouncing the ""offensive and incorrect"" suggestion ""that I would have engaged in any attempt to jeopardize someone's job because of their religious affiliation."" He said he found ""that kind of action--or even the suggestion that I engaged peripherally in that kind of effort--to be morally wrong and totally out of bounds."" This wasn't just a lie. It was what Newsweek's Evan Thomas, my onetime boss, likes to call an ""exuberant lie."" The proof lay in the memo from Sept. 8, 1971, that the National Archives withheld. Nineteen years after the Post story appeared, Kenneth J. Hughes of the University of Virginia's Miller Center of Public Affairs furnished me a copy. I would encourage Gov. McDonnell to read it. Malek's memo was addressed to Nixon's chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, and the subject line was ""Bureau of Labor Statistics."" Malek reported: ""I had several meetings with [Labor] Secretary [James D.] Hodgson to convince him of the need for fairly drastic moves."" The BLS, Malek wrote, ""will be organized with 6 out of 9 existing offices being combined into a newly created Office of Data Analysis"" to be headed by a newly created deputy commissioner. The BLS already had a deputy commissioner named ... Ben Burdetsky. ""[I]nstead of replacing Burdetsky as Deputy Commissioner,"" Malek explained, ""the plan creates a second Deputy over the most critical areas. This is a compromise, but I believe it is a workable solution."" I can't prove that Burdetsky was on Malek's earlier list of 13 Jewish-sounding names (only the number became public), but what Malek described was clearly a demotion for Burdetsky, whose unsuitability had apparently been a matter of prior discussion between Haldeman and Malek. Goldstein and Henle were almost certainly on Malek's Jew list; both were Jewish, and both had displeased Nixon by supporting objective (as opposed to politicized) interpretations of unemployment data. This was the supposed act of disloyalty that first convinced Nixon that Jews in the BLS were out to get him. Goldstein, Malek reported, ""will be moved to a routine, non-sensitive post in another part of BLS."" Henle and Leon Greenberg, another BLS data-cruncher, ""will be transferred when the reorganization is announced."" Malek concluded by promising that, by the end of September 1971, Labor Secretary Hodgson would announce the reorganization and force ""the transfers of Goldstein, Henle, and Greenberg. These moves do not go as far as I would have preferred but represent a reasonable compromise [with the president's demand for a Jew purge] that I feel will make the BLS a more responsive and effective unit."" Let's review, once again, what Malek said in 1988:"	Fred Malek's anti-Semitic past makes him unfit to chair a state government panel.	['Nixon']	['gay']
2	2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/05/rand_old_party.html	"This is an anti-establishment year, and no one personifies that sentiment better than Rand Paul. He trounced his establishment-backed opponent in the Kentucky Republican Senate primary by railing against Washington and GOP leaders who did not support him. It turns out, however, that the establishment isn't completely useless. The establishment would have advised, for example, that it was a bad idea for a conservative with wide-ranging views to go back on The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC so soon after his victory. Maddow spent about 20 minutes last night quizzing Paul about his views on the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and he and the Republican Party have spent the last 24 hours cleaning up the mess. Paul said he believed that the federal government should not tell private businesses whether they could discriminate. He hated racism as much as anyone, he said, but believes that businesses that discriminate should be forced to change through private action: speaking out, boycotts, and the like. As a practical matter, that ignores history and the human behavior of the time. But as a political matter, this just isn't something a candidate says out loud--even if he believes it. At worst, it makes him seem to take racism lightly, and at best, it's distracting. Before lunch, Paul had put out a statement that he would not support the repeal of the law. This is what it looks like when the anti-establishment bumps up against the establishment. Now that Paul is the official GOP nominee, he has a higher profile. He's added to his newsworthiness by claiming his campaign is at the vanguard of the Tea Party movement. That gives him a higher profile still. It also invites the Democratic Party to try to make him the symbol of the entire GOP and means the Republican establishment may have to answer for the things he says. Democratic Party operatives must have melted their servers with all the e-mail messages they sent to reporters questioning Paul's views on racism and his libertarian beliefs. Were they so extreme that he would not support one of the signature laws of American equality? This is what opposition parties do. With Paul, the Democrats have ample material from his past. But rarely does the candidate help his enemies by providing a fresh moment to paint him as an extremist. Republicans rushed to distance themselves. Senate leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Jim DeMint had backed different candidates in the Kentucky primary, but they were united in their effort to move away from Paul's remarks. (This was not the kind of Republican unity the party was looking for.) McConnell put out a statement that said ""Among Senator McConnell's most vivid memories and most formative events in his career was watching his boss, Sen. John Sherman Cooper, help pull together the votes to break the filibuster and pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964."" As a part of the damage control, Republicans pointed out that there are sitting Democrats who opposed the 1964 bill, including Robert Byrd who filibustered it for 14 hours straight. But Byrd and current Democrats don't hold those views now. For his part, Paul argues that a 1964 law would not be relevant to issues he'd face as a senator. But that's not exactly right. The questions about his views on the Civil Rights Act grow out of his present-day views about limits on government intervention. That's always an issue in Washington, especially right now, as the Senate debates a bill to regulate financial institutions. At its core, it involves the question of just how far government can go to regulate private enterprise. Democrats are pressing Paul so hard for several reasons. It's not that they just want to win the seat back from the GOP. They want to make every Republican defend Paul. Democrats need African-American turnout to be high this election. Getting into a debate about civil rights would help that. But they'll also try to keep Republicans responding to Paul's other non-establishment views--such as the need to abolish much of the federal government, including the Federal Reserve and Social Security Administration. Parties always try to do this with extreme figures: They impute their views to the party as a whole. Long after she stopped being a politician and became a political celebrity, Democrats are still trying to make Republicans answer for Sarah Palin. They'll have an easier time with Paul because before today's moving away, Republican officials were rushing toward him. Immediately after Paul won, McConnell embraced him. A unity rally has been planned. Why the rush? Paul is a leading light in the Tea Party movement. When he won, he claimed the victory in their name. Tea Party activists don't like Washington. If you're a Washington politician and you want to stay alive, you need to look like you're on their team. Hence: Embrace Rand Paul. But elections are also made up of suburban voters and moderate voters who might think it strange to be against a portion of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Though Republicans rushed to respond, it may not mean Democrats will get much more out of Paul's collection of exciting quotes. Democrats tried the same thing with DeMint, who once said single moms shouldn't teach in South Carolina schools. DeMint is now a senator and considered a rising star in the party as a voice for the populist conservatives. In other words, he's now a member of the establishment. He might have some advice for the man who hopes to be his colleague. Like  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter."	Why Democrats can't wait to use Rand Paul against the GOP.

3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/05/missed_saigon.html	"Never say Richard Blumenthal didn't fight for his life. He's just doing it in Connecticut instead of Vietnam. In a hastily convened press conference Tuesday in Hartford, Blumenthal rebutted charges in a front-page New York Times article that he lied about his war record. ""On a few occasions, I have misspoken about my service, and for that I take full responsibility,"" he said, flanked on both sides by Marines Corps veterans who injected periodic  Oorahsand Semper Fi's. ""But I will not allow anyone to take a few misplaced words and impugn my record of service to our country."" With that, Blumenthal settled at least one question: He doesn't appear to be backing down in the Connecticut Senate race. Democrats, including the man he is trying to replace, Sen. Chris Dodd, spoke out in support of Blumenthal. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee seems poised to fight on. And the revelation that at least one of the quotes was fed to the Times by Blumenthal's opponent, former WWF executive Linda McMahon, allows Blumenthal's supporters to dismiss the accusations as political hay. (Blumenthal himself declined to address that subject at the presser.) But other questions remain. Lying about your war record might be the most politically damaging revelation in America short of the infamous ""dead girl or live boy"" scandal. (A cheating scandal, on the other hand, is now practically a qualifier.) So Blumenthal has to be careful in his efforts to explain this one away. It helps that the evidence isn't exactly conclusive. It turns on the intent of individual words. The Times found one instance of Blumenthal saying he served ""in Vietnam."" But he also said explicitly in a recent debate that ""I did not serve in Vietnam."" In another quote, he seemed to include himself among veterans who came back from Vietnam: ""When we returned, we saw nothing like this. Let us do better by this generation of men and women."" But at a 2008 ceremony for veterans, he said, accurately: ""I served during the Vietnam era. I remember the taunts, the insults, sometimes even physical abuse."" Blumenthal may not have deliberately made false statements. But the main charge in the Times story--that ""he does not volunteer that his service never took him overseas""--is a sin of omission, not commission. Between 1965 and 1970, Blumenthal received at least five deferments and then served six years in the Marine Corps Reserve. At today's press conference, Blumenthal continued to play word games. He said he ""misspoke"" when he used the word ""in"" instead of ""during"" Vietnam. When a reporter asked him what he meant by ""misspoke,"" Blumenthal's response sounded as if it had been vetted by a team of lawyers, PR reps, crisis communications experts, and lawyers again for good measure: ""I was unaware of those misplaced words when they were spoken."" Responsibility must be taken, just not in the active voice. Blumenthal's lying, misspeaking--whatever you want to call it--says as much about the world politicians inhabit as it does about Blumenthal's motivations. Fudging isn't just common--it's necessary. Does Barack Obama really ""love"" Arlen Specter, as he said in a recent political ad? Does John McCain really believe he never considered himself a ""maverick""? Does Harry Reid really think ""we are going to pass comprehensive immigration reform,"" as he told a crowd in Las Vegas in April? Probably not. But that's how you make friends and influence people. Spend enough time in the gray zone, and what seems like a black-and-white lie to most people seems normal to you. Then there's the sheer volume of words politicians utter. Blumenthal noted at the press conference that he talks about his military service all the time. But he misspoke once, and everybody pounced. The process was probably more gradual, though. Politician tell stories over and over, adding tidbits every time. That's how you get Hillary Clinton saying she landed under sniper fire in Bosnia. It's also what happened with Blumenthal, according to former Rep. Christopher Shays: ""[H]e just kept adding to the story, the more he told it. I think what happens in a case like this, it's a tiny increment of change, but when you haven't heard him in years you say, that's a big difference."" It doesn't help that Blumenthal flails off-script. In an interview with the Times, he struggled to articulate why he was running for Senate. When a reporter asked if he would have voted for TARP, he turned to an aide and asked, ""Have I taken a position on this?"" For voters concerned about Blumenthal's record--wartime or otherwise--that quote may be the most damning of all. Become a fan of  Slate on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

4	4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/05/primary_school.html	"We know that this is a ""throw the bums out"" election. Tuesday, voters in Pennsylvania, Arkansas, and Kentucky will give us a sign of just how far they want to throw them. In three party primaries and one special election, voters will offer hints about their mood toward the president's policies as well as incumbents in both parties that will help shape the political decisions for the rest of the year. Here's a look at each of the big races: Pennsylvania Democratic SenateSen. Arlen Specter is indestructible. He's survived two bouts with cancer, arguments with Anita Hill that horrified female voters, and the authorship of the much-derided ""single-bullet theory"" of the Kennedy assassination. (His quixotic bid for the 1996 presidential nomination as a pro-choice Republican was such a long shot it doesn't even count.) If Specter loses the Democratic primary, it will mark a historic political moment. There are two kinds of angry voters this year: those who think their party's representatives have been insufficiently respectful of their party's ideology, and those who think Washington politicians are only concerned with saving their jobs. Specter, who switched to the Democratic Party in 2009 after 30 years as a Republican senator, has managed to irritate both groups. The race is embarrassing for the White House because it shows the limits of presidential political power. Obama's aides failed to persuade Specter's opponent, Rep. Joe Sestak, to get out of the race. And the president's political power is so limited, he dared not risk it by swooping in at the last minute to campaign for Specter. Obama's campaigning against Republicans in Massachusetts and New Jersey didn't help much. Why risk it in Pennsylvania? The most important thing the president could do Tuesday is what he is doing: campaigning in Youngstown, Ohio, for his stimulus package. Obama may lack influence in a quirky intraparty battle. But he can affect the general election dynamic by improving the way voters feel about the role Democrats played in improving the economy. To do that, he has to create a link in the minds of voters between an improving economy and his policies. Then, he'll have to convince voters that the less popular Democrats in Congress deserve praise for that too--a lot to accomplish by November.  It's not an easy sell. In the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, only 18 percent said the stimulus package had been effective--but at least Obama has a shot at changing their minds. And 573,000 jobs have been created over the last four months--at least there's a chance that trend could continue. Arkansas Democratic Senate PrimaryIn a year of anti-incumbent and anti-establishment sentiment, Sen. Blanche Lincoln may survive not because she distanced herself from Washington, but because she knew how to use her experience to her advantage. The primary challenge from her left allowed her to establish herself as independent, an important thing this election year. In her early television ad, she declared: ""I don't answer to my party. I answer to Arkansas."" She then used the power of her position to undermine the case being made against her. As chairman of the agriculture committee, which matters in a state where 25 percent of the economy comes from agriculture, she spearheaded an anti-derivatives bill that was even harsher on Wall Street firms than legislation the White House was promoting. This helped her combat the claim that she was too close to corporate America--and allowed Obama to herald her in a radio ad as ""leading the fight to hold Wall Street accountable and make sure that Arkansas taxpayers are never again asked to bail out Wall Street bankers."" Her position on the bill allowed labor unions and progressive groups, which dived into the race to punish Lincoln for her lukewarm support of health care reform, to declare victory--for their cause, if not their candidate. (They are supporting Lt. Gov. Bill Halter.) The derivatives legislation is a once-in-a-generation achievement for working people, they argue. As a political matter, their message was that Democrats shouldn't take them for granted. By moving quickly to limit their influence, Lincoln also helped them send that message. Kentucky Republican Senate PrimaryThis is most interesting race, theatrically. Rand Paul continues the family tradition of upsetting the Republican Party order of things. Polls suggest he is almost certain to beat Mitch McConnell's hand-picked Republican Party candidate, Secretary of State Tray Grayson. Late in the race, Grayson has doubled-down on his establishment support. If Paul wins, there will now be three high-profile examples of the new contours of the GOP landscape. Anti-establishment fever cost three-term Sen. Bob Bennett of Utah his job, and it forced Charlie Crist out of the Republican field in Florida. Unlike the Democratic Party infighting in Arkansas--where Lincoln, the establishment candidate, appears to have been able to push back against the activist tide--the populist conservative tide in GOP politics is more powerful. Now we have to wait until November to find out how the Tea Party message plays with independent and moderate voters. Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional DistrictOf the four big races political elites are watching closely, this is the only one that isn't a primary. The three other races make for lively viewing, but this one, to elect a replacement for 37-year Democratic veteran John Murtha, who died in February, may be the most thematically interesting. Tim Burns, the Republican, is running against Washington bailouts and against the Democratic Congress. The landscape should favor him. The district is conservative (Murtha was pro gun and anti-abortion), the economy is bad, and the previous occupant of the office   was tinged with scandal. Mark Critz, who worked for Murtha, is linking Burns with the policies that brought about the economic collapse--which tracks with the core message of Obama and the Democratic Party nationally. Democratic and Republican groups have poured millions of dollars into the race. Unions have been working it particularly hard--here working with the Democratic Party's interests, as opposed to what they're doing in Arkansas. The race is also being closely watched for hints about turnout. This is a low-energy year for Democrats, and Republicans are enthusiastic. If Democrats pull out a win, it may signal that an all-out push can save marginal seats in a year that favors Republicans. If they can't, Republicans can feel a little bit better about those 49 districts John McCain won in 2008 that also elected incumbent Democrats.

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/05/public_enemies.html	"President Obama was feeling loose at a Democratic campaign fundraiser Thursday as he talked about the Republican Party. ""We got our mops and our brooms out, we're cleaning stuff out, and they're sitting there saying, 'Hold the broom better.' 'That's not how you mop.' "" He then went from the utility closet to the garage. ""After [Republicans] drove the car into the ditch, made it as difficult as possible for us to pull it back, now they want the keys back. No! You can't drive! We don't want to have to go back into the ditch! We just got the car out! We just got the car out!"" After months of unified Republican opposition, Obama has mostly given up on the bipartisan talk that characterized his campaign and first 15 months of his administration (although it's still a nice sentiment for college commencement addresses). Also, with a tough election ahead, both parties are defining their opponents in ever sharper terms. And yet, just when bipartisanship is falling out of favor in the White House, a scraggly version of it is popping up through the cracks in the concrete. Financial regulatory reform will likely pass in the Senate with Republican votes. And Elena Kagan, the president's Supreme Court nominee, will also probably get a number of Republican votes. There was a time when administration officials made great effort to show that they were working on a bipartisan basis. His commitment to bipartisanship was part of what voters liked about Obama. Even when Republicans said they would not vote for legislation, White House officials worked hard to show that Republican ideas had been incorporated into it. In the original stimulus package, for example, the administration agreed to a $70 billion adjustment to the Alternative Minimum Tax that did little to stimulate the economy but which was favored by Republicans. Now it appears there will be actual bipartisanship. On financial regulatory reform, several Republicans have been working with Democrats to shape the bill. Republicans will almost certainly vote for the bill, and it will pass. Meanwhile, Kagan has only been through her preliminary meetings with senators, but some Republicans (Susan Collins and Scott Brown, to name two) already sound favorably disposed to her. This does not suggest a new era in Washington or a thaw, but the timing of these new blips of bipartisanship is a bit inconvenient politically for Democrats. Limiting the expected losses in the 2010 elections requires painting Republicans as blindly obstructionist. Depicting them as merely meddlesome with bad ideas won't do. It doesn't inspire people enough to get out to vote. Neither does saying they're merely dumb at first but ultimately persuadable. The argument has to be clear and bright. Republicans need to be defined as a party that thinks, as the president put it, ""If the Democrats lose, we win."" He has to make that contrast stark because polls show that the American people don't really see much of a difference between the two parties in Congress. In the most recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, when people were asked which party cares more about ""average Americans,"" only 35 percent said Democrats in Congress. That's better than the 20 percent who cited Republicans, but it shows that on a key issue of the day, neither party is doing very well. Majorities also think both parties care more about large corporations. One way to change that dynamic is to enlist someone who people do think is looking out for them. Just more than half--51 percent--of those asked think Obama is looking out for average Americans. The same poll showed that nearly 70 percent of Americans like Obama personally. So he still may have the best standing to make the case against Republicans. From Day One, the president told his Democratic audience in New York, Republicans have blocked him for purely political reasons. This would seem to contradict his commencement address in Michigan earlier this month, when he told the graduates: ""You can question somebody's views and their judgment without questioning their motives. ... The problem is that this kind of vilification and over-the-top rhetoric closes the door to the possibility of compromise.  It undermines democratic deliberation."" The president would probably prefer to stay above the fray. But his Democratic colleagues are not in a position to make much of a case against their opponents and aren't likely to improve their reputation with the public. They are not, for example, going to take rash measures to become more transparent in lawmaking or give up earmarks entirely, gestures that might shock the public into giving the Democrats who control Congress a second look. (Though they're trying.) The irony, for the president who spent so much of his early administration trying not to look partisan, is that financial reform may be a bipartisan success precisely because he was willing to play rough. Unlike health care reform, where Obama stayed out of the congressional fight, with financial reform he has been more active. He took on Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell directly, saying his efforts to label the legislation a ""bailout bill"" were ""cynical and deceptive"" and, questioning his motives, argued that Wall Street bankers were guiding his hand. And twice, Obama criticized specific amendments as favors to Wall Street. Democrats think this presidential pressure (and polls that show 71 percent of the people think Republicans care more about large corporations) helped bring Republicans to the negotiating table. Republicans, of course, see it differently. They argue that they helped bring the Democrats to a more reasonable piece of legislation by unifying against an earlier, unreasonable version. Yet Republicans also face a risk from bipartisanship: If they can actually work with Democrats, can they really be as crazy as Republicans say? What all this means is that even after the bipartisan bill passes, there will still be partisan fighting over why it did. Maybe the president can console himself that this (politically inconvenient) era of bipartisanship is likely to be fleeting. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook.

One of them, Republican leader Mitch McConnell, took to the Senate floor to raise questions about whether she will be a captive of the White House she works for. ""In our constitutional order, justices are not on anybody's team,"" said McConnell. ""They have a very different role to play. As a Supreme Court justice, Ms. Kagan's job description would change dramatically. Far from being a member of the president's team, she'd suddenly be serving as a check on it. This is why the Founders were insistent that judges be independent arbiters, not advocates."" McConnell is almost certainly not going to vote for Kagan. But like those Republicans who might, he wants to know whether she has an independent judicial standard she will apply from the bench. Where does her thinking come from? Her head, her readings, her heart, or her former boss? This is not necessarily a crazy line of inquiry. It's something every nominee must weather. But just as Kagan must prove that she has a standard that doesn't shift with the whims of her current boss, so, too, must the senators who sit in judgment of her show that they have a consistent standard. And if the senators don't want her standards driven by her employment, it's fair to ask whether their standards are driven by their party affiliation. In this regard, there has already been coverage of how Republicans have changed the standard they applied to Harriet Miers, the last nominee who (like Kagan) was not a judge. McConnell didn't raise the issue of Miers' ties to then-President Bush when she was nominated, which might be considered garden-variety political shape-shifting. But it becomes something more of a whopper when one remembers how close Miers was to the man who nominated her. Harriet Miers was not only the president's White House lawyer--a job closer to Bush's interests than Kagan's are to Obama's as solicitor general. Miers also had been Bush's personal lawyer since the mid-'90s. She was the lawyer for his gubernatorial campaign, and in 2000, Miers was Bush's presidential campaign lawyer. Plus, she was a close personal friend. ""You are the best governor ever--deserving of great respect!"" she wrote in one birthday card. She wasn't just on the Bush team. She was captain of the cheerleading squad. None of the senators now raising these questions about Kagan made an issue of Miers' closeness to Bush and used it to argue that she could not be counted on to rule against the Bush administration. In fact, when the Bush administration was doing its sales job--identical to the work the Obama team is doing now--it often cited Bush's close personal relationship with Miers. Because of their relationship, the argument went, Bush knew Miers' ""heart""--and that was supposed to be all one needed to know. That wasn't a good enough standard, as many conservatives pointed out at the time. And if we want to be consistent about our standards, it's probably those conservatives we should listen to now, rather than the ones making this case out of convenience.

7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/05/empathy_in_academia.html	"As solicitor general, Elena Kagan is referred to as Gen. Kagan in official settings. Republicans would prefer that you call her Professor Kagan. Soon after President Obama nominated her to replace Justice John Paul Stevens, Republicans were using her academic career to characterize her as an ivory tower elitist and insider. ""Ms. Kagan has spent her entire professional career in Harvard Square, Hyde Park, and the D.C. Beltway,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who sits on the Judiciary committee and also runs the GOP's senatorial campaign committee. ""These are not places where one learns 'how ordinary people live.' "" The political fight over a Supreme Court nominee starts like a hockey game. The puck is dropped, and each side works furiously to take control of it. Republicans were reacting to the administration's description of Kagan as a brilliant trailblazer and consensus builder and the product of a family that valued public service. She also has a keen understanding of how the law affects the daily lives of the American people, the president and his advisers said. Anticipating the Republican line of attack, the president said Kagan's ""passion for the law is anything but academic."" Focusing on Kagan's connection to regular people serves two purposes. First, Obama believes such a worldview is necessary to beat back the conservative Roberts court. Second, the ordinary-people pitch is also a part of the Democratic Party's election-year story line. The Democrats are in office to protect you, dear ordinary American, from the insurance companies, Wall Street banks, and oil companies. The main White House talking points about Kagan are hard to refute. She is very smart. She was the first woman to serve as dean of Harvard Law School, where stories of her efforts to reach out to conservatives are well-known. She is the first woman to serve as solicitor general. The argument that Kagan has a special understanding of ordinary people, however, is harder to make. She may very well have a fellow-feeling unmatched on the planet. It's just not immediately obvious how a graduate of Princeton who taught law at the University of Chicago and Harvard and then became dean of Harvard Law School has the common touch. It was easier for the president to make a similar case about Sonia Sotomayor, who had been a district attorney and had an up-from-the bootstraps story that Kagan lacks. In presenting Kagan, Obama cited her work arguing the Citizens United case. How many people even know what the Citizens United case is? It, like Kagan's career, requires a little bit of explaining before you're in a position to be convinced that her position on campaign finance--actually, it wasn't her position but the government's--shows that she understands how the law affects regular people. The talking points the White House sent to their elite supporters also cite Kagan's Harvard Law Review article ""Presidential Administration"" as proof that she understands how the law affects people's lives. It was honored as the year's top scholarly article by the American Bar Association's Section on Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice. After reading some of the article, which addresses the structure of the White House, I asked for some clarification about how that article addressed issues related to regular Americans. A White House aide suggested I Google the host of legal experts who had said so. (I did. I couldn't find them.) In terms of the nomination, will any of this actually matter? Republicans have been making the case that Obama doesn't understand the lives of regular people. Now they can add that Obama's idea of someone who does is an ivory-tower intellectual. That will be good for fundraising and some jokes. But it's hardly disqualifying. The White House stretched the truth about Sonia Sotomayor in a more blatant way on the supposedly toxic ""wise Latina"" quote, and she was still confirmed. Republicans face other problems in their critique of the Kagan story line. GOP senators opposed the very notion of evaluating candidates based on their ability to identify with the plight of ordinary Americans. Often, they have praised Chief Justice John Roberts, who said his job was merely to ""call balls and strikes."" To say Kagan falls short of that standard is to accept that standard. As a political matter, they can make the case that Cornyn did. But when it comes to the hearing, it's hard to see how they turn this argument into an effective line of questioning. It may also be that no one is listening to the president. People may care more about all those other qualifications Kagan has than about the president's empathy standard. Maybe people view Supreme Court justices the way they think about doctors--they want theirs to be properly credentialed and very smart. During the various attempts to find a hidden agenda in Sotomayor's past, White House aides could point to her actual rulings as proof that fantasies about her were constrained by reality. Kagan doesn't have the same kind of record. That means no embarrassing opinions--but it also means she may be easier to turn into a cartoon. Perhaps, but in today's initial round, Republicans were frenzied and unconvincing. Kagan wasn't a judge, said Cornyn. But that wasn't a problem when he was praising Harriet Miers, George Bush's nominee for the high court in 2005. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell raised questions about whether Kagan could be impartial as a jurist because of her previous service in the administration. Again, it was not a point he raised about Miers. (A staffer says his concerns about this issue with Miers came some time later.) This gives off the impression--shocking, I realize--that the opposition to Kagan is frantically political. Then there was the press release from the RNC asking, ""Does Kagan Still View Constitution 'as Originally Drafted and Conceived' as 'Defective'?"" The question--aimed at suggesting Kagan was a judicial activist--came from a tribute Kagan made to Justice Thurgood Marshall shortly before his death. She quoted the first black justice as having said the Constitution as originally conceived and drafted was ""defective."" Looking at the quote in context--or thinking about it for half a minute--it's clear that Marshall was talking about the Constitution's three-fifths clause, which valued slaves as less than a full human being. Even in the mayhem of the hockey face-off you can still get called for high-sticking.

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/05/a_noboehner.html	"Today House Minority Leader John Boehner issued a grave charge against the president in the wake of the Times Square bomb plot. He suggested it was merely luck that there had not been a major terrorist attack during the Obama administration. Obama lacks a ""comprehensive strategy for war"" against terrorists, he charged, and had no strategy for preventing future attacks. You can make the case that President Obama's strategy for fighting terrorists is dumb, too cautious, or ineffective. But no one who wants to be taken seriously can claim Obama lacks a strategy. Boehner is either being sloppy with his language, slippery with the facts--or both--to score political points. The rap against Democrats used to be that they had a law-enforcement mentality when it came to fighting terrorists. The charge was often leveled against John Kerry in the 2004 presidential campaign, and Boehner is making it again here. It's a hard claim to support about Obama, who has spent a lot of time formulating and putting in place anti-terrorist policies and giving speeches devoted to the more efficient killing of terrorists. Obama has approved nearly twice as many CIA airstrikes against targets in Pakistan during his first year in office as President Bush did in his final year, killing twice as many targets. Since taking office, Obama has tripled the number of troops in Afghanistan. Their mission, as the president pointed out repeatedly in his West Point speech announcing the move, was to keep terrorists there from coming to kill Americans here. Even Sen. Jim DeMint, the conservative Republican critic of the president, says that Obama has been moving ahead in an ""aggressive, sensible way in Afghanistan."" On Christmas Day, U.S. forces were engaged in a long-planned attack in Yemen, the country where the Christmas Day bomber was trained. Obama's strategy of reducing nuclear weapons and his nonproliferation policy are intended mainly to deprive terrorists of material for their attacks. Rhetorically, Obama has also been focused on the issue. ""I do not make this decision lightly,"" he said about his decision to send more troops to Afghanistan. ""I make this decision because I am convinced that our security is at stake in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is the epicenter of violent extremism practiced by al-Qaida. It is from here that we were attacked on 9/11, and it is from here that new attacks are being plotted as I speak. This is no idle danger; no hypothetical threat."" But his most extraordinary global pitch for the use of military force to stop terrorists came in his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize. Now let's examine Boehner's complaint. When I asked for a list of policy proposals that would represent the kind of improvement Boehner was calling for, I received some examples: no importing of prisoners from Guantanamo, improving communication between different intelligence agencies, opposing the trial of terrorist suspects like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed on U.S. soil, not reading Miranda rights to terrorists like the Christmas Day bomber, and providing a comprehensive detention strategy. These may be fine ideas, but they're limited--and they don't come close to matching the size of Boehner's complaint, which is about the full scope of the terrorist-fighting exercise. He talks about ""international terrorist organizations"" and the need to do more than ""catching [terrorists] at the last moment."" But four of those five items are about actions taken after the terrorists have been caught. If Boehner's critique had been made during the Bush administration, it would not just have invited criticism on its specific points; it would have been held up as evidence that Boehner fundamentally misunderstands the nature of the war against the extremists. In his critique, Boehner is not acting alone. He is parroting the same arguments put forward by Dick Cheney and Sarah Palin. As a political matter, this seems sensible: Defining your opponent's approach to fighting terrorists by its least popular elements is a wise strategy. Moving Guantanamo prisoners to the United States is not popular. Nor is trying KSM in New York--a fact that Scott Brown exploited in his winning campaign for Ted Kennedy's Massachusetts Senate seat. In fact, many Republicans believe that the lesson of the Brown victory is that national security, not health care, is a potent political issue against the Democrats. Whether Obama's strategy against terrorists is a smart one is certainly a suitable subject for debate and conversation. But Boehner's charge in its present form doesn't deserve a hearing at the adults table. And Obama didn't give it one. At the time Boehner was making his remarks, Obama was in the Situation Room, attending one of his regular meetings with the secretary of defense, Gen. David Petraeus, and other national security advisers. They were discussing the strategy the minority leader says the president doesn't have.

9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/05/good_government.html	"In the extended political argument over the size of the federal government, the last few weeks have favored Team Big. Wall Street excesses, the Gulf Coast oil disaster, the West Virginia mine collapse, the flooding in Tennessee and Kentucky, the Tylenol recall, and the Times Square bomber--it's a long list that reminds us that we depend on the federal government to ward off disaster or limit the damage afterwards. It would seem to be a good time to be a Democrat--the party that associates itself with activist government. Is it playing out that way? Democratic officials have to be careful answering this question. No one wants to be seen making political hay out of tragedy or near-tragedy. (Except Rush Limbaugh, who pointed out that the accused Times Square bomber is a registered Democrat: ""I wonder if his SUV has an Obama sticker on it."") But the political benefit from these recent events has been visible enough. Obama administration officials, from Press Secretary Robert Gibbs to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, have said they will ""keep a boot on the throat"" of BP in order to make sure the company does its share to clean up the oil spill. Today, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee released a fundraising letter quoting that line and arguing that the oil spill offers a reason to elect Democrats. ""We can stand with President Obama and the Democrats who are moving the country forward, or we can allow Republicans--led by Limbaugh and the Tea Parties--to cater to the needs of big corporations and special interests."" David Plouffe, Obama's 2008 campaign manager and the person heading up the president's 2010 efforts to elect Democrats to Congress, made a similar case to Obama activists Monday. Democrats are pitching themselves as the protectors. Fresh examples on the front page of the misdeeds of Big Oil, insurance companies, and Wall Street help remind Democratic voters why it is important to go to the polls in November. Disasters also allow President Obama to perform the most appealing, action-figure elements of his job--issuing declarations, visiting disaster areas in a monogrammed windbreaker, and holding emergency briefings. Obama has the political leeway to do this almost as much as he likes. These are, after all, disasters, but also, after George Bush paid the political price for not reacting quickly enough to the Katrina, a president gets a lot of space before he can be tagged with the charge that his reaction is merely self-aggrandizing. The biggest political bump for Democrats would come if people started connecting improvement in the economy with the government's activism. Democrats think they see the seeds of this in the latest CBS/New York Times poll. Americans are more optimistic about the economy now than at any time since the recession. Forty-one percent say the economy is getting better, up from 33 percent in April. Only 15 percent say the economy is getting worse. President Obama's approval rating on the economy has also improved, with 48 percent approving and 47 percent disapproving of his performance--up five points from last month, and Obama's highest rating since November. More cautious Democrats worry the poll is a one-off. They (and Republicans) also argue that the recent spate of crises makes for good talking points in a fundraising letter, but aren't likely to lead to a wholesale change in public opinion. Which is pretty solidly anti-government. A recent Pew poll found that esteem for Congress is at a 25-year low, and that trust in government is also at an historic nadir. ""Rather than an activist government to deal with the nation's top problems, the public now wants government reformed and growing numbers want its power curtailed,"" wrote the authors. ""There is less of an appetite for government solutions to the nation's problems - including more government control over the economy - than there was when Barack Obama first took office."" This suggests that the Republican warnings about big government takeover are hitting home. Republicans hope to build on this mistrust by branding Democratic efforts at smart government into attempts to merely grow government. They point to the recent financial collapse, arguing that government regulators didn't stop the risky behavior on Wall Street that led to the collapse. In some cases, government involvement made the situation worse--Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were allowed (some would say pushed) to spin out of control. Dismal opinions of government are also fed by ready examples of the bureaucracy not doing its job well--from the handling of the Christmas Day bomber to  SEC regulators watching pornography instead of doing their jobs. In the case of the Times Square bombing attempt, there were also  lapses, and the administration response to the oil spill was  not as fast as the White House would like us to believe. Even well-intentioned legislation can create unintended consequences, conservatives argue. That was the chief claim against the $50 billion liquidation fund that was once a part of the Wall Street reform working its way through Congress. Republicans argued that the fund, meant to help dismantle banks that fail, would send the signal to investors that certain banks were safe investments. They would grow so big that that if they ever did fail, the fund wouldn't be enough. Government would have to step in to rescue them or risk damaging the wider economy. Late Tuesday, Democrats agreed to drop the provision. Even when it comes to regulating Wall Street--and here public opinion supports more regulation--it's not clear that people want as much regulation as they think Democrats are suggesting. In a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, half of the 65 percent who support financial regulatory reform say it should be less strict than Democrats are proposing. Crises are a chance to showcase activist government, but they also often end in voters blaming the party in power. Given the number of unpredictable emergencies that have popped up since Barack Obama took office, Democrats may be benefiting now, but the story could change again tomorrow.

10	10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/05/oh_well.html	"Every industrial disaster yields lessons, and the oil spill off the coast of Louisiana last month will be no different. BP should have had more safeguards against explosions, we will learn. Regulation should have been tighter. Drilling should have been banned so close to shore. But the real lesson of the oil spill may be how bad we are at dealing with unlikely but disastrous events. ""We deal with them by ignoring them until they happen, and then overreacting,"" says John Harrald, a professor at George Washington University's Institute for Crisis, Disaster, and Risk Management. It's one thing to look back and figure out how the oil spill could have been prevented. It's another to grapple with the combination of poor foresight and 20/20 hindsight that makes preventing these meltdowns so difficult. The problem begins with the way we assess risk. The less likely an event, the less a company--or a government, or an individual--feels the need to guard against it. No one knows yet what exactly caused the BP spill. But it does appear to be an example of several systems failing at once. We know there was an explosion (Failure No. 1) that caused the whole oil rig to collapse (No. 2), at which point the blowout preventer--a valve designed to seal off the well near the ocean floor--did not activate properly (No. 3). The chances of one of these things happening are not insignificant. The odds of all three happening at once are vanishingly small. ""Look at the expected value of a blowout of a well,"" says Harrald. (""Expected value"" of risk is a mathematical term that means probability multipled by consequences.) ""It's all the way down there with natural seepage and road runoff. It's a meaningless value."" Any cost-benefit calculation would therefore ignore or heavily discount the possibility--even if the consequences are monstrous. Another problem is that some precautions make sense only in hindsight. Before 9/11 and the shoe bomber, for example, the precautions that the TSA now takes--locking cockpits, banning fluids, requiring that shoes be removed--would have seemed absurd. ""It's hard to get the public's attention,"" says Greg Shaw, also at George Washington. ""It's hard to inconvenience them based on the idea that this may happen."" Likewise, the precautions necessary to prevent the BP oil spill--some are blaming the absence of a sonar device used on rigs in Norway and Brazil to shut off the flow of oil--would probably have been dismissed as overly draconian. Now we'd be crazy not to require it. ""It becomes very emotional after the fact,"" says Matthew Kotchen, an professor of environmental economics at Yale University. Then there's the difficulty of cost-benefit analysis when it comes to low-probability, high-consequence events. The full costs of an oil spill are difficult to estimate--even decades later. After the  Exxon-Valdez spill, Exxon paid more than $3.8 billion for clean-up and damage, plus about $500 million in punitive damages. But some lawyers argue that the true cost of the spill is much greater. There are many different ways to assess environmental damages--you could calculate it as cost to local fisheries, harm to the tourism industry, or even how much the average American would pay to keep the ocean unpolluted. If a company wanted to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of whether to pay for a particular safeguard on each of its oil rigs, where would it start? Plus, a well isn't like a tanker; you can't always tell how much oil it contains. So calculating the costs of an accident would be that much more difficult. That doesn't mean oil companies shouldn't take precautions against spills. It's just hard to calculate the value of those seemingly excessive precautions ahead of time. When it comes to actually fixing problems, we're almost as incompetent. ""We tend to regulate for that very specific event,"" says Harrald. After the Exxon-Valdez spill, for example, Congress passed a law that banned that ship from traveling in Alaskan waters. (For branding reasons, Exxon renamed the ship the  SeaRiver Mediterranean.) At the same time, certain ports in Alaska became highly regulated, while others in Seattle and San Francisco remained lax. It's as if Congress passed a law against lightning striking twice. Likewise, the BP spill has provoked a fast response. The White House started backpedaling from its promises to lift the moratorium on offshore drilling. ""No domestic drilling in new areas is going to go forward until there is an adequate review of what's happened here and of what is being proposed elsewhere,"" said White House senior adviser David Axelrod. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger rescinded his support for drilling off the coast of California. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar ordered inspections of all deep-water operations in the Gulf of Mexico. But overly narrow regulation can have unintended consequences. A crackdown on off-shore drilling might be politically smart, but it could drive business to countries with even less regulation of their oil industries. It could also boost demand for tankers, which have historically spilled more oil than American oil rigs. The best responses to unlikely events take a holistic look at the problem, says Harrald. Rare events ""raise opportunities to look at whole systems and get the political will and public support to do something about it."" In this case, that might mean not only examining the safety of tankers and oil rigs, but also reducing our dependence on oil in favor of renewable energy technologies like wind and solar. But that might be the least likely event of all. Like  Slate on Facebook. Follow us  on Twitter."	Why we're so bad at dealing with unlikely disasters like the Louisiana oil spill.	[]	[]
11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/04/love_me_love_my_party.html	"Democrats revealed themselves as the ""Results Party"" this week. They can only hope the new pitch will work like it did for George W. Bush in 2000 in his primary race against John McCain. Facing a tough a landscape similar to the one Democrats face now, Bush billed himself as a ""Reformer With Results."" He needed to redefine the race from a referendum on the appeal of McCain into a choice between their two records. A little more than a month later, Bush was the nominee. There are two parts to this ""results"" message: I have produced results, and the other guy hasn't. Bush's message was about what he'd done in Texas, but it was also that McCain was a phony. The Democrats, too, are pushing a two-pronged message. ""Republicans have obstructed the president and worked to defeat his and the Democrats' agenda for one primary reason: political calculation,"" said Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine, announcing the new pitch. ""They have placed their own politics above progress on our nation's most pressing issues."" This new approach is aimed at President Obama's 2008 voters: Democrats who were energized by the new candidate but also the 15 million voters who entered the political process for the first time because they liked Obama so much. This presents a tension for Obama. If the strategy relies on beating up on Republicans, how mean can he get? If he takes on Republicans too much, he could dampen the enthusiasm of the voters from 2008 who fell in love with his post-partisan, bridge-building message. If the president keeps it positive and hopeful, he may not be able to motivate enough voters to compete with conservative voters, who are very motivated. Talking about results is not exactly a new idea (in politics or this year). Pollsters and Democratic officials have been talking about the need to show voters tangible progress for months. However, having a big public slogan unveiling helps capture the attention of reporters who like to cover the process of campaigns. The lunch hosted by the Christian Science Monitor at which Kaine unveiled the message was well-attended. It also gives Democrats another chance to remind everyone what those results are--improvement in the economy, heightened activity in the war on terror, reform of the health care and financial regulatory systems. People need reminding. Polls show that voters aren't pleased with Obama and the Democrats. In a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, 60 percent of registered voters say they are looking for someone new rather than an incumbent. On Obama's performance on the economy, the gap between those who strongly disapprove and those who strongly approve is 15 percentage points (39 percent to 24 percent). On the deficit, the gap is 22 points (42 percent to 20 percent). In response, Kaine said, ""It's up to us to tell that story well."" He may be saying this the day after the election. The president has had a hard time getting his message across. On health care reform, for example, the president promised Democrats that once the legislation passed, it would become more politically popular. It has not. The numbers have gone in the opposite direction. Democrats need to do more than just win a kitchen-table debate. They need to create voter energy. Republican voters are energized (despite the GOP's overall bad ratings) and anti-government independents are motivated to remove incumbents, more of whom are Democrats. Energizing Democrats requires a mix of inputs, but one of the ways it can be done is through the kind of sharp message Kaine is previewing--Republicans threaten the things Democrats care about. The promise of Obama, which these first-time voters supported in 2008, cannot be realized if Republicans continue to stand in the way. Kaine and other Democrats can't be the only ones to send this message. The president is the most effective speaker on this topic. Not only is he the most popular Democrat in the business, he's also had some success. He took on insurance companies at the end of the health care debate and had some success. He called out Minority Leader Mitch McConnell recently in the debate over financial regulatory reform and increased the political pressure that ultimately helped break the legislative impasse. We got a view of how far Obama can go during the Massachusetts Senate race. As Kaine says, that race ""was the ghost-of-Christmas-future experience for us""--a precursor of what they will face in November. Obama, in the one speech he gave in support of the Democratic candidate in that race, put the choice in stark terms, defining Republicans as ""protectors of the big banks, and protectors of the big insurance companies, protectors of the big drug companies."" Obama and Democrats won't benefit from residual anger at Bush as much as they did in 2008. They also can't rely on the more important motivator in that election: Obama's message that he was going to change Washington. Almost 70 percent percent of new voters in 2008 chose Obama based on platform of change, according to a CNN analysis. Washington hasn't changed since Obama came to office. It is as partisan as it has ever been. There are many reasons for this. Voters overwhelmingly think that it's because Republicans have been obstructionists. But leaving aside for a moment the question of blame, the question is whether 2008 voters who had hoped for a better political atmosphere are going to get motivated all over again if that kind of change seems unlikely. They may get even more apathetic if Obama plays too prominent a role in cutting up the opposition. George Bush's former pollster Matthew Dowd thinks that, regardless of whether Obama draws sharp distinctions, he has lost his ability to motivate voters the way he did in 2008. ""He has put himself in the position Bush put himself in after five years,"" says Dowd. ""He's forgotten the rationale for why he was elected. He ran and won because he was going to bring the country together. That's been thrown aside in favor of getting accomplishment on certain issues."" The counterargument is that Obama won't necessarily have to continue his trajectory of increasing partisanship. He can leave the tough stuff to others. He can simply return to the message of hope and optimism he sold so well in 2008. He will speak as passionately about what he has accomplished as he did when he spoke to Democratic lawmakers about the need to pass health care reform on the eve of the vote. That will remind voters--particularly the 15 million who don't like negativity--why they had such hope for Obama in the first place. He's done it before, on his own behalf. Now the president and his party just have to hope that he can do it again, on behalf of his fellow Democrats. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter."

""They put red bandanas on their head, took a drink of sake, and went out on what I believe will be a kamikaze mission,""said Sen. Kit Bond, R-Mo., on March 22. Not all Democrats disagreed. As recently as April 16, Democratic pollsters Douglas Schoen and Patrick H. Caddell confidently pronounced health reform ""an incontrovertible disaster"" leaving Republicans ""ripe to pick up major gains in both chambers this November."" And just last week conservatives turned cartwheels when a poll released by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found the public's trust in government to be at its lowest point in half a century. The dire predictions aren't entirely off-base. It is virtually guaranteed that Democrats will lose congressional seats in November, because whichever party controls the White House almost always experiences at least some attrition in midterm elections. While there are signs the economy has started to recover, unemployment will likely exceed 9 percent through the end of the year, further diminishing Democratic prospects. And although implementation of health care reform will likely shrink its opposition, the major provisions don't take effect until 2014--one year after a significant payroll-tax increase for families earning more than $250,000. But if prospects were as bad for Democrats as many insist, one would expect today's dominant political story to be that Democrats are panicking. In fact, the dominant political story is that Republicans are panicking. Consider: Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., calls a timeout. The Senate's most bipartisan conservative is moving to break off negotiations with Democrats on immigration and climate change. He says it's because Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., played politics with the immigration issue. But it seems at least as likely that Graham feels the heat from wingnut constituents back home. Florida Gov.Charlie Crist, almost chosen in 2008 to be the vice-presidential nominee, quits the GOP and  runs as an independent. There's little doubt he's doing this not out of conviction but because he would lose the primary to a Tea Party-backed conservative. The leading GOP candidate for president loses his conservative base. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is trying desperately to convince economic conservatives that his signature health care reform was dramatically different from Obamacare, but they aren't buying it. That's a serious problem for a candidate whose chief constituency in the 2008 race was ... economic conservatives. The most recent GOP presidential nominee may lose his Senate re-election race. Granted, the conservative bona fides of Arizona Sen. John McCain were in the past called into question by his support for campaign finance reform, his opposition to President George W. Bush's first tax cut, and positions on various other issues. He may even have flirted briefly with the idea of becoming a Democrat. But in the 2008 race McCain re-defined himself as a conservative, and now he no longer will cop even to being a maverick. Until recently there seemed a real chance McCain would lose to challenger J.D. Hayworth in the August primary. With that possibility now diminishing, McCain must now worry whether he can win the general. A recent matchup had McCain winning only 46 percent of the vote against Tucson Vice Mayor Rodney Glassman. (Glassman got 24 percent, with 30 percent undecided.) The most recent GOP vice-presidential nominee is a tabloid joke. Sarah Palin quit the Alaska governorship with 18 months left to go in her first term. That indicates either that she's abandoned whatever ambition to run for president she may have had or that whatever ambition she maintains is profoundly unrealistic. Evidence is mounting that her chief career interest is to cash in on her fame. Republican governors are romanticizing the Confederacy. Virginia's Robert McDonnell backed down. Mississippi's Haley Barbour said there was no need to. Guess which one wants the party of Lincoln's presidential nomination? Republican members of Congress are getting whupped on the financial regulation bill. As it heads to the Senate floor,Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell commands nothing like the loyalty he enjoyed when he tried, unsuccessfully, to block health care reform. That's because Tea Partiers hate Wall Street. Conservatives are  debating whether their movement has reached ""epistemic closure."" In this context, ""epistemic closure"" means ""brain death."" I don't mean to overstate the case. Close to a dozen ""well established"" House Democrats may lose their seats, according to the New York Times' Jeff Zeleny and Adam Nagourney; among them are Wisconsin's David Obey, who chairs the House appropriations committee; South Carolina's John Spratt, who chairs the House budget committee; and Missouri's Ike Skelton, who chairs the House armed services committee. Reid still faces a tough re-election fight. (Though perhaps he's worrying less now that his likely GOP opponent is babbling about using poultry to pay for health care.) And Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter, who may lose his Democratic primary, now says, ""I might have helped the country more if I'd stayed a Republican."" But the sense of panic and hysteria seems more exaggerated these days within the GOP. For the first time in memory, it's the Democrats who look disciplined and the Republicans who seem in disarray. Part of me thinks this can't possibly last. Another part wonders whether the Democrats know something the rest of us don't. Like  Slate on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

Put another way: Did the employees of Goldman Sachs deliberately mislead investors by failing to disclose that one of the people creating a certain mortgage-backed security was also betting against it, as a new lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission alleges? Or did they simply recommend mortgage-backed securities to investors, then turn around and bet against them--essentially betting against their own investors? The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations may have failed to prove the former, but it presented a strong case for the latter. The hearing pitted senators determined to find wrongdoing--they sifted through a five-pound stack of  internal e-mails, company memos, letters to investors, and financial statements--against Wall Streeters insisting they were just doing their jobs. As a result, the hearing was less about litigating the SEC case than it was about senators highlighting and assigning blame for the causes of the financial crash. Committee chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., who, as always, appeared to have stepped right out of The Pickwick Papers, got right to the point in his introductory remarks: ""Goldman Sachs didn't just make money. It profited by taking advantage of its clients' reasonable expectation that it would not sell products that it didn't want to succeed, and that there was no conflict of economic interest between the firm and the customers it had pledged to serve."" In other words, Goldman has an obligation to be honest with its customers. And part of that obligation is to tell them what Goldman thinks of the investments it's selling. Goldman Sachs didn't just disagree. The half-dozen current and former employees dragged before the panel, including CEO Lloyd Blankfein, took a position so contrary, it's as if they were speaking a different language. Levin said Goldman was ""shorting,"" or betting against, the housing market. Goldman said it wasn't--it was merely hedging against its bets that the housing market would succeed--and that its ""short"" was hardly ""big."" (The shorts just happened to outweigh the longs.) Levin argued that Goldman was misleading its clients by hiding the fact that it thought subprime securities would fail. Blankfein argued that its clients don't care what Goldman thinks of the assets it's selling, even if it were possible to ascertain what all 35,000 Goldman employees ""think"" of a security. Levin said Goldman has an obligation to disclose how an instrument is created. ""I don't believe there's a disclosure obligation,"" Blankfein said. That much was clear. Blankfein and company mastered the nonstatement so well they brought to mind Alberto Gonzales circa 2006. Take this exchange between Levin and Daniel Sparks, head of the Goldman Sachs mortgages department, over whether clients betting on the subprime securities should have been informed that Goldman was betting against them (edited for length):"	The Senate tries to get Goldman Sachs to admit it sold America a pile of crap.

14	14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/04/too_big_to_fail.html	"At 5 p.m. Monday, Senate Republicans united to block debate on financial-regulatory reform. Afterward, Republicans and Democrats traded the usual charges and countercharges. The president weighed in with some tough rhetoric: ""I am deeply disappointed that Senate Republicans voted in a block against allowing a public debate on Wall Street reform to begin. Some of these Senators may believe that this obstruction is a good political strategy, and others may see delay as an opportunity to take this debate behind closed doors, where financial industry lobbyists can water down reform or kill it altogether. But the American people can't afford that."" If it all sounded depressingly familiar, it's because it was. Don't worry: Legislation is still likely to pass. Despite efforts to make this vote seem dramatic, the real drama (and work) is going on behind closed doors--and Republicans, in the end, don't dare buck legislation that is so popular. (Despite the president's alarmist rhetoric, he has a list of a few Republicans who will flip in the end).  Still, it's no wonder that the American people have such a low opinion of Congress. Even when senators are doing their jobs, they make it look ugly. Christopher Dodd and Richard Shelby are, by all accounts, working like adults to bridge their differences on the 1,300-page bill to regulate the financial industry. When the two top members of the Senate Banking Committee appeared Sunday on Meet the Press, it was a courteous and pretty substantive exchange. There was no shouting, and the hyperbole was kept to a minimum. Dodd mentioned several times how hard he and his counterpart had worked. I talked to Shelby today, and he, too, said that Dodd was ""negotiating in good faith."" In addition to those two, Mark Warner and Bob Corker are working together on the legislation. This behind-closed-door process is about as good as it's ever going to get in the Senate on a contentious issue on which lobbyists have spent so much time and money on both sides of the aisle. (And on which Democrats need at least one Republican to block a filibuster.) The legislative negotiating feels as if it's getting somewhere, and there will probably be a deal in the end. The process may not be pretty. But it shows a skeptical public that members of Congress can work through complicated issues in a reasonable fashion. Then again, there are the scenes and sound bites that take place outside the negotiating room. Here the public can readily have its opinions confirmed. The debate is full of the hyperbole and countercharges that irritate and turn off people. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has called the legislation a partisan bailout bill, a charge Obama has called ""cynical and deceptive."" The Democratic National Committee put a picture of McConnell on its Web site in front of a series of columns with the line: ""The Party of Wall Street: All 41 Republican Senators Announce That They Stand With the Big Banks to Oppose Wall Street Reform."" Neither of these charges is true. But they spur predictable countercharges: As if on cue, the National Republican Senatorial Committee posted a ""Democrat Hypocrisy Alert"" pointing out all the money Wall Street employees have given to Democrats. The likelihood of passage is inviting more misbehavior, not less. Both sides are trying to score points while they still can and shape the story line for after the legislation passes. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid called today's vote to proceed to debating the bill in order to put pressure on Republicans. It didn't work (by the time the vote was called no one thought it would), but Democrats still think it works for them politically. Democrats want to turn this afternoon's vote to proceed with debate into a referendum on which party is tougher on Wall Street. They hope the stain is so indelible it will remain even if Republicans join Democrats in supporting the final bill. Democrats would seem to have the better of the political moment.  According to a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll, 65 percent of the public supports reform. * The public also trusts Obama more than Republicans on the issue of financial reform. When Republicans opposed health care reform, they had public opinion on their side. Now they don't. You'd think that given the numbers, they'd be making Chris Dodd tea, not voting against his legislation. The reason Republicans could vote against the motion to proceed with debate is that they know they'll vote for the bill in the end. (The measure has 50 percent support among conservatives,is backed by 69 percent of independents and 74 percent of moderates.) Meanwhile, Republicans think they won't pay much of a political price for today's procedural vote, because while Wall Street is unpopular, so is the federal government--and so are the congressional Democrats pushing the bill. Moreover, the ABC News/Washington Post poll shows half of those supporting reform saying it should be less strict, which gives Republicans confidence to call for tweaking. (So does the fact that Democrat Ben Nelson voted with Republicans on Monday. He said that with negotiations continuing, he couldn't vote on debating a bill that didn't yet exist.) Democrats are trying to argue that Republicans are stopping the fireman on his way to the fire. But it may be more correct to say that that the public sees Republicans as merely checking to make sure his buckets aren't full of gasoline. In this election year, Republicans are planning to campaign on the idea that they will serve as a brake on the excesses of the majority party. If a bill passes, Republicans will claim they turned a bailout bill into a sensible bill. After the vote, negotiators will continue doing their work while their colleagues try to squeeze one last bit of politics out of the delay. Last week, a Pew poll found that people have their lowest opinion of Congress in 25 years. If legislation does finally pass, perhaps it will improve those numbers. Then again, given the way Congress is proceeding in public, perhaps ratings will drop further. Maybe Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs who is scheduled to testify before the Senate tomorrow, can give members some advice about short selling their own stock.

15	15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/05/obamas_job_program.html	"There was a time when the White House and Rep. Joe Sestak were enemies. Now they're in the bunker together: Neither wants to talk about whether a White House official tried to get Sestak to drop his campaign for senator by offering him a job. With its reticence, the Obama White House raises some eerie (and, from its perspective, unwelcome) parallels with the Bush White House. President Obama endorsed Sestak's opponent, incumbent and recent Democratic convert Arlen Specter, in Pennsylvania's Democratic primary. Included in the standard package of services that accompanies such support is ""field-clearing""--encouraging challengers to look for employment opportunities elsewhere. Sestak says that an administration official offered him a job if he'd drop out of the race. He declined and went on to win the party's nomination. Now he and White House officials are allies in trying to keep the seat in the Democratic Party. This situation provides a corollary to Kinsley's law about Washington scandals, which is that the scandal isn't what's illegal, it's what's legal: Offering a job in exchange for dropping out of a political race actually is illegal. But it's not that scandalous. In previous administrations and in both parties, this kind of pressure has been applied. And both parties are smart enough to never make any offers explicit. It works like religion (or the mafia, if you want a secular example): The understanding is that, if you do the right thing, your reward will come later. That may have happened in the Sestak case. We don't know. And that's the problem: White House officials won't talk about what happened, going mum almost exactly as their predecessors did during the inquiry into who in the Bush White House leaked the name of a CIA agent. The questions about what Sestak was offered have been nagging for months. They were renewed after he defeated Specter. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs has responded as he did months ago. ""Lawyers in the White House and others have looked into conversations that were had with Congressman Sestak and nothing inappropriate happened,"" he said multiple times last week. Match this response with the one Scott McClellan gave in October 2003 when asked about what White House officials may have said about CIA official Valerie Plame. Reporters wanted to know who said what to whom. McClellan responded: ""I spoke with those individuals ... and those individuals assured me they were not involved in this."" The problem with both responses, of course, is that we can't just take the word of White House officials. Sestak says the offer was made, and the White House admits there were conversations. At least three laws might have been broken, according to Darrell Issa, the Ranking Member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. With that many, it shouldn't be up to one of the interested parties to decide whether any laws were broken. Gibbs sounded even more like McClellan at a press briefing last Friday, when he successfully ducked 13 questions on the matter. After a while, McClellan learned to duck such inquiries by saying he couldn't answer questions because a special prosecutor was looking into the matter. That won't happen in this case. The Department of Justice blew off the request to name a special prosecutor to look into the Sestak matter. That's better for the White House, because no White House wants an investigation into its internal workings. But it leaves this fish flopping on the deck. It's not hard to imagine how the White House could come up with a new response. A little more information will probably make the political pain go away. There are, of course, no guarantees, and one of the reasons White House officials don't want to get more specific is that once you let out information it also gives your opponents ammunition to call for a broader inquiry. But this situation is very different than the CIA leak case in the Bush administration. The stonewalling is the same, of course, but the issue at the heart of the two is not. What the White House is covering up now is a purely political act: trying to persuade someone not to run for office. It happens all the time in politics. At the center of the leak case then was an issue of national security: specifically, the principle that the identity of CIA agents should not be made public, especially as part of an effort of political damage control. It was an exceptional story. And it came at a time when the Bush White House was also defending itself in a host of other instances where it massaged facts to make the case for an unpopular war. So why even make the analogy at all? Because ""trust us"" isn't a satisfactory answer--no matter what the question. Building a stone wall is about the wall, not what the wall is hiding. And there's also the matter that Obama promised new levels of transparency when he ran for office. He promised new levels of bipartisanship, too, and those haven't materialized. But you can blame the Republicans for some of that. In this case, there's no one to blame but him. This isn't the first time administration officials have chosen expediency over transparency. It probably also won't be the last. Like  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter."

Rand Paul was born as a national leader of the Tea Party movement. Arlen Specter's long political career came to an end. And the Democratic Party and Blanche Lincoln were brought back from the dead. The most dramatic moment of the night was Specter's defeat. It's hard to imagine the Senate without him. This is the man who wrote  Never Give In, a book about battling cancer while serving as a senator. But his other book-- Passion for Truth--tells us why he lost. Subtitled, in part, ""Impeaching Clinton,"" it offers one of many clues as to why it was hard for a senator who spent almost five terms as a Republican to reinvent himself as a Democrat. The most important news of the evening came out of the 12th congressional district in Pennsylvania. The Democrat, Mark Critz, won handily in a Republican-leaning district that went for McCain two years ago. Democrats are going to have a tough year this year. History is against them, the polls are against them, and an electorate angry with Washington punishes the party with more representatives in Washington. But this is a story they can whisper to themselves quietly at night to make the demons go away. Maybe things won't be so bad after all. It's also a great story for Democratic organizers trying to motivate the troops to turn out in an off-year election. But Critz's victory was mixed for Democrats. Labor unions worked tirelessly to deliver this election for the party, which spent $1 million on the race. That amount of money and effort will be hard to duplicate in every contested congressional district. Also, it's worth noting that Critz won by distancing himself from Democratic leaders in Washington and running against Obama's health care plan. He boasted in an ad that he would have voted against it had he been in Congress. If there is a message for Democrats coming from this race, it's how to combat Republicans who want to make the election a referendum on Obama. By focusing on local issues and keeping the race from being a referendum on their leaders in Washington, Democrats can be competitive. The question is: Will every Democrat have as much local cover as Critz did? He wrapped himself in his former boss, Jack Murtha, who held the seat for 37 years. This result may also cause Republicans to do some rethinking of their national strategy. It's not that they'll suddenly start paying attention to local issues. Every politician does that, where they can. But they might rethink their effort to run against Obama. Except they can't. That's what motivates their voters. In the most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, those who said they wanted a Republican Congress were asked why. Only 31 percent said because they approved of Republican policies; 64 percent said because they wanted to stop Obama. Rand Paul won handily in Kentucky and launched himself as a national Tea Party leader. The press is always trying to find Tea Party stories where they may not exist, but in this case Paul was the one hyping the movement. ""I have a message from the Tea Party,"" he said in his victory speech. ""Washington is horribly broken. The Tea Party movement is a message to Washington that we are angry and we want to do things differently."" (This strategy is far different than the one Marco Rubio is pursuing in Florida. Also a Tea Party favorite, Rubio is working to keep a little more distance in the general election, where he must court moderates and independents.) The question for Paul now becomes whether his message can translate in the general election against Jack Conway, Kentucky's attorney general. Democrats in the state are enthusiastic. They turned out for their primary race in greater numbers than they did in the 2007 gubernatorial primary, a possible sign that they might turn out for Conway in November. Nationally the question for Paul is how he will handle his increased profile as a Tea Party leader. Will he seem like an oddball when his words are broadcast far and wide, or will he appear as a compelling voice for a nation of people fed up with business as usual? But there are also intraparty dynamics worth watching in this race that will continue after the primary. Kentucky will be the first place the Tea Party will try to meld with the Republican Party. Will there be tissue rejection? Not if Mitch McConnell, who backed Paul's opponent, Trey Grayson, can help it. McConnell knows that some things are necessary in politics. Immediately after the race was called for Paul, he issued a glowing statement about the Republican nominee and his anti-Washington message. McConnell isn't just doing this to repair his party at home. He's also got a mildly annoying challenge to his authority from a fellow Republican senator, Jim DeMint, who endorsed Paul and heralded his victory as a defeat of party insiders like McConnell. In Arkansas, Blanche Lincoln received more votes than her opponents, which was a remarkable achievement given that she was considered finished a few months ago. But it may be only a temporary reprieve. Labor unions are going to continue working against her. They've had a very good night, securing the victory in Pennsylvania's 12th district and nearly defeating a powerful incumbent in Arkansas. Their efforts in the June 8 runoff will serve to advertise the message by the AFL-CIO's new leader, Richard Trumka, that Democrats can't take labor's support for granted. Adding injury to Lincoln's night, the derivatives legislation she championed--and that some analysts believe helped her win back some Democratic voter support--looked like it was being shredded by fellow Democrats in the Senate. The night showed just how limited Obama's political power is. He said he'd work all-out for Specter, but he didn't campaign for the senator in the final days. That may have been a wise reservation of his political capital (he's already been ineffective in previous races), but it also demonstrated how much has changed since 2008, when Obama was talked about as a force that could remake the political landscape. Critz won by running away from Obama's signature achievement, and Lincoln, whom he supported, was forced into a runoff. For a president who is still far more popular than the Democratic Congress he aims to help, yet who is unable to translate much of that popularity to do so, this condition may be best described as limbo.

But college students considering a career in government should probably add a fifth: Politics-proofing. The clamor over Elena Kagan's college writings have reached such a pitch that the White House announced that it will post both of her theses online.  The first is her Princeton senior thesis on the New York Socialist Party in the early 20th century. The second is a paper she wrote while at Oxford on the ""exclusionary rule,"" the legal principle that allows a judge to deem evidence inadmissible in court. Poring over a politician's college thesis has become routine--a quick way for opponents and the media to define a candidate they don't know much about. Hillary Clinton's thesis on Saul Alinsky riled conservatives during her presidential bid. Michelle Obama's essay on being a black student at a mostly white university sparked angry--and inaccurate--chain e-mails. Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell's masters thesis, in which he described feminists as ""detrimental"" to the family and said that government policy shouldn't favor ""cohabitators, homosexuals or fornicators,"" nearly derailed his campaign. (McDonnell was 34 when he wrote it, but says his views have changed in the ensuing two decades.) Conservatives have now pounced on Kagan's Princeton thesis as evidence of socialist sympathies. It's like a treasure hunt. Whoever finds the most inflammatory quote wins. But a college thesis tells us little, if anything, about the person seeking office 30 years later. ""What a thesis tells you is what a person is interested in learning more about at age 21,"" says Eric Foner, a history professor at Columbia University. But that's about it. In my case, that happened to be American Catholicism during the Spanish Civil War. Does that topic say anything about me now? Not really, except that I kind of liked Homage to Catalonia. College thesis writing is a haphazard, often random process (as opposed to a doctoral dissertation, which takes more care). You have a few weeks to find a topic. You settle on one based on a combination of what hasn't been written, availability of sources, and, if you're lucky, a passing interest in the subject. Then you need an argument. You don't really know anything, though, so you end up overcompensating by making a stronger argument than the facts merit. If you aren't overstating your case, you aren't doing it right. You then have a semester to write a 50-page essay--a task that would be difficult even without the added burden of classes, extracurriculars, and the intense hepatic demands of senior spring. Indeed, the entire thesis-writing industry seems geared toward endangering future politicians. Students are encouraged to find unexplored topics. (The greatness and sagacity of the Founders might be a politically safe subject, for example, but it's been done.) Professors also push students to challenge historical orthodoxy. Adhering to the status quo might help at the nomination hearing. But it makes for bad thesis writing. Students are also buffeted by historical forces beyond their control. ""The most important thing about a thesis is the year it was written,"" says Douglas Brinkley, a historian and professor at Rice University. Students can of course choose their own topics and arguments. But subject matter, research techniques, and political angles are dictated largely by trends in historiography. Clinton's interest in Saul Alinsky says as much about history departments in 1969 as it does about her. And, of course, writing about a political group is not the same as endorsing it. The oft-cited example is John Roberts' 1976 Harvard essay titled ""Marxism and Bolshevism: Theory and Practice."" Foner had a similar experience: ""My first book was on the early history of the Republican Party--and I am not a Republican."" Theses of politicians shouldn't be off limits. It's useful to know what someone running for office now--or being nominated--was thinking early in life. But college is about screwing up. ""I hate to think that my students have to live by everything they write in an academic report,"" says Brinkley, who has written biographies of Gerald Ford, Rosa Parks, and Theodore Roosevelt. Judging a Supreme Court justice by her thesis would be like judging Roosevelt, a mostly peacetime president, by his youthful bellicosity alone. Journalists shudder at the thought of someone discovering their college output. Political operatives would rather forget their campus protest days. Even many professors would like to wipe their senior theses from the public record. ""My own undergrad writing is a disgrace for someone who became a professional historian,"" says Elaine Tyler May, president of the Organization of American Historians. Supreme Court nominees should get the same bye. College is the last refuge of the dumb mistake--even if that mistake happens to be an intelligent, thorough, and accurate thesis.

The AP chalked both defeats up to the country's ""anti-establishment mood.""Time called Mollohan ""anti-incumbency's first real casualty.""Politico speculated about which incumbents could be next. The victors are pushing the anti-Washington narrative, too. Opponents of Bennett and Mollohan painted the incumbents' experience as a liability. ""I think he's been in Washington too long,"" said Tim Bridgewater, the Utah businessman who defeated Bennett and has never held public office. Meanwhile, the West Virginia state senator who defeated Mollohan, Mike Oliverio, called fellow Democrat Mollohan a ""corrupt"" Washington insider and, for good measure, took shots at the party leadership. ""Hopefully, there will be a better candidate [for Speaker] than Nancy Pelosi,"" he said. But for all the pitchfork-sharpening, what happens when anti-establishment candidates arrive in Washington? One of two things, usually: Either they quickly adapt to the establishment, or they serve for one term. The most recent adapter has been Scott Brown. In January, Brown campaigned as a strong conservative, promising to be the 41st vote against health care reform. He never said he would block every piece of the Obama agenda. But he certainly let voters believe it. Democrats played along. (They also benefited from exaggerating his reactionary tendencies.) Chuck Schumer labeled Brown ""far-right."" The Boston Globe said he was in sync with the national Republican Party--that is, more conservative than Massachusetts Republicans. Tea Partiers, meanwhile, claimed him as their own. Since then, Brown has let them down. He voted for Obama's jobs bill, despite pledging to rein in spending. He joined Democrats in breaking a Republican filibuster of an unemployment benefits package. Obama has also pegged Brown as a possible ally in the upcoming fight over immigration reform. No surprises there. For one thing, despite all his anti-Obama rhetoric, Brown has always been a moderate. His voting record in the state senate suggested he was liberal even for a Massachusetts Republican, according to a study conducted at the time by the University of Chicago's Boris Shor. He only busted out the government-takeover rhetoric for the campaign. Brown isn't alone. Everyone promises to change Washington. And everyone compromises when they get there. It's just politics. ""Most outsider candidacies are wildly contradictory,""says Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution. ""If you say you're going to make the Senate work and all you do is support filibusters and prevent action, you're not being faithful to what you said you were going to do."" Then there's what Shor calls the ""basic re-election imperative."" ""Whatever you want to accomplish,"" he says, ""you can't do it in a single term."" Re-election itself requires becoming part of the Washington establishment--candidates have to raise money for fellow party members in hopes that they'll return the favor, and they have to keep their heads down so as not to tick off the leadership. ""Outsider"" candidates often say they'll serve only one term, as Bob Bennett did in 1992. But those who have a good shot at re-election almost always take it, as Bob Bennett did in 1998 and 2004. For any congressional candidate to believe that he or she can ""shake up"" Washington upon arrival may be unrealistic. But it's not necessarily disingenuous. They may actually believe it. Or they may simply not understand how Washington works. (They're outsiders, after all.) There's little one person can do to derail the legislative train that's been chugging along for 250 years. First-term members of Congress are also the least equipped people to do it. They don't have seniority on their committees, they don't wield personal influence, and they don't have chits with the leadership. Incumbents, on the other hand, have seniority, respect, and the connections necessary to bring home the loot--a skill set known in election years as ""experience."" But that often means they've been around long enough to see their district's ideology shift beneath them. Sure, some anti-establishment types make a career out of being outsiders. But they rarely have much clout within the establishment itself. Take Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio. He's known for sticking with his ideals, such as including a public option in health care reform. Same with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who brought a single-payer bill to the Senate floor in December even though he knew it stood no chance. They may force their party to the left now and then. But more often they shout into the void--and ultimately compromise, as both Kucinich and Sanders did on health care reform. It's also true that outsider candidates do often vote differently from their predecessors. But that not's necessarily because they're outsiders--it's because they have different views from their predecessors (presumably, that's part of the reason they defeated them). Oliverio, for example, would probably have voted against health care reform. Bridgewater would probably have voted against TARP. But neither vote would have had much to do with how long they had spent in Washington. There's always a tension between the Washington establishment and the district back home. But it's a flexible one. When politicians ""make the system work"" for their district by bringing home goodies, constituents tend to give them some ideological leeway. Sometimes, though, the ideology gap becomes too great, the rubber band snaps, and suddenly Bob Bennett is looking for a job. His ""outsider"" replacement might better reflect his district's ideology. But by the time he's in a position to change the way Washington works, he will be, by definition, the establishment. Become a fan of  Slateon Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

21	21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/05/you_know_the_drill.html	"What happened? That was the $14 billion question at the Senate Energy Committee's hearing on the Gulf oil spill on Tuesday. But in answering that question, executives from the three companies involved in the disaster--BP (which leased the rig), Transocean (which owned the rig), and Halliburton (which cemented the base of the rig)--pre-empted a second one: Who's to blame? The answer, in each case: not me. ""I can already see the liability chase,"" said Robert Menendez of New Jersey before the main panel had even begun. ""It's like a bit of a Texas two-step: 'Oh yeah, we're responsible.' But BP says Transocean, Transocean says Halliburton. So I can see the liability chase that's gonna go on. I'm looking forward ... to see who's gonna fess up to what."" Oh, the suspense. The blame-shifting began the moment the executives opened their mouths. In his prepared statement, Lamar McKay, president of BP America, referred repeatedly to the rig as the Transocean Deepwater Horizon (italics mine). ""We don't know yet precisely what happened the night of April 20th,"" he said. But he seemed pretty sure that whatever went wrong, it was on Transocean's watch. ""Transocean, as owner and operator of the Deep Water Horizon drilling rig, had responsibility for the safety of drilling operations,"" he said. He also emphasized that the leak sprang when the rig's 450-ton blowout preventer--which, by the way, was built and operated by Transocean--failed. Steven Newman, chief executive of Transocean Ltd., didn't see it that way. In fact, it was far from clear that the leak had anything to do with the blowout preventer. ""Over the past several days"" (actually, the past several minutes) ""some have suggested"" (for instance, the guy to his right) ""that the blowout preventers used on this project were the cause of the accident,"" Newman said in his prepared remarks. ""That simply makes no sense."" After all, drilling was complete on April 17, and the hole was sealed up. If there was anything to blame, it was ""a sudden, catastrophic failure of the cement, the casing, or both. Therein lies the root cause of this occurrence; without a disastrous failure of one of those elements, the explosion could not have occurred."" The company responsible for the cement? Halliburton. Tim Probert, Halliburton's chief health, safety, and environmental officer, pointed out that Halliburton is ""contractually bound to comply with the well owner's instructions."" Translation: They were just following orders. Like his colleagues, Probert warned against ""a rush to judgment."" However, he said, two things were for sure: The casing was cemented 20 hours before the accident--meaning Halliburton had mostly completed its job. And ""had the BOP [blowout preventer] functioned as expected, this catastrophe may well not have occurred."" Back to you, Transocean. (For a more detailed account of what may have happened to the rig, see here.) The senators lost patience quickly. ""There's going to be plenty of time to try to figure out who is to blame,"" said Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. ""I would suggest to all three of you that we are all in this together."" Still, senators focused most of their heat on BP. Oregon's Ron Wyden demanded to see an itemized list of reforms the oil giant had implemented after the fatal explosion in a Texas refinery in 2005 and a leaky Alaskan oil pipeline in 2006. Menendez criticized BP's frenetic response to the spill as indicative of poor planning. ""I get the impression you're making this up as you go along,"" he said. Murkowski said it ""amazes"" her that BP hasn't tested chemical dispersants--the fluids being used to break up the oil slicks--at deep levels before. McKay took his flogging. Where he drew the line, though, was on the question of liability. After the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989, Congress passed a law capping liability for damages from oil spills at $75 million, not counting cleanup. Members now want to raise the cap to $10 billion. But, Maria Cantwell said, ""to make that retroactive is nearly impossible."" She therefore wanted to know what kinds of claims BP would honor. McKay repeated the mantra of his boss, BP CEO Tony Hayward:"	The Senate Energy Committee interrogates BP and other oil executives over the Gulf spill.

22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/05/all_politics_is_vocal.html	"Tea partiers celebrated two victories this weekend. The first was ousting Sen. Bob Bennett of Utah after 18 years in office at the state's Republican nominating convention. The second was rewriting the Maine Republican Party's platform to read like a Tea Party manifesto, anti-ACORN provisions and all. Both victories were greeted with shock--and predictions of more Tea Party revolts to come. ""It's the beginning of a trend,"" said Robin Wright of Bennett's defeat on ABC News' This Week. But neither event is likely to be replicated on a large scale. Rather, they were examples of grassroots activists taking advantage of the quirks in two states' electoral processes--in one case, the nominating process, in another, the party platform process--to draw national attention. Take the Utah example. Instead of a regular statewide primary, Utah's Republican Party holds a runoff at the state convention, where 3,500 delegates vote on the full roster of Republican candidates. Those delegates, sent to the convention by their local committees, tend to be more conservative than the average Utah Republican, which is saying something. As a result, Bennett made it through the first round of voting on Saturday but came in third place in the second round, with only 27 percent of the vote, which eliminated him from the ballot. Because the deadline for registering as an independent has already passed, Bennett's best shot at winning the June primary was gone. (He could still stage a massive write-in campaign.) A normal primary would probably have turned out differently. In late April, a poll of registered Republican voters showed Bennett 20 points ahead of his closest challenger. But a smaller pool of voters--or in this case, delegates--gives vocal activists outsized influence. ""With voting, there's a filter for how excited you are,"" says Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform. ""If you're not excited you don't vote."" The bar for attending a convention is even higher. You have to take four hours, find a baby-sitter, find someone to cover you on your job, and drive to the convention. ""There's a heavy sieve,"" says Norquist. The smaller pool also multiplied the effects of the Club for Growth's $200,000 campaign against Bennett, which highlighted his vote for the Troubled Asset Relief Program and his co-sponsorship of the Wyden-Bennett health care bill. In other words, the ads fell on disproportionately receptive ears. Maine was an unusual case, too. Most state GOP conventions accept the party platform approved by the platform committee, which consists of party representatives from each county. When the platform reaches the floor, other delegates sometimes offer minor amendments. This time, though, one county committee offered an amendment that would repeal the original platform and replace it with a whole new document. It passed. Now the official Maine Republican Party platform explicitly opposes the Fairness Doctrine, advocates a ""return to the principles of Austrian Economics,"" and warns against ""efforts to create a one world government."" This may not take advantage of laws specific to Maine. But the decision to scrap the entire document spontaneously reflects that state's New England-y ""town meeting"" form of governance. ""That's the spirit of town meetings,"" says Mary Adams, a conservative activist who was on the GOP platform committee. ""Oh, somebody's got a better idea, let's go with that."" Other states have similar quirks that Tea Partiers may try to exploit. Any state with a nominating convention, for example, favors vocal insurgents. Tea Partiers are already gearing up for Colorado's convention on May 22, so much that moderate Republican Senate candidate Jane Norton has decided to bypass the convention entirely, ceding the affair instead to Tea Party favorite Ken Buck. Norton will gather signatures to qualify for the ballot instead. There's nothing new about exploiting a state's electoral quirks. The last time a national candidate tried, it worked out rather well. Barack Obama famously leveraged the Iowa caucuses to his advantage--he had the most energized voters--and then focused on other caucus states that award a disproportionate number of delegates to a smaller group of voters. Hillary Clinton all but wrote them off. Obama thus eked out a victory, even though Clinton won larger states like Texas and Ohio. Taking advantage of local quirks is key for any national insurgency. So is knowing the ins and outs of the party convention process. George McGovern won the Democratic nomination in 1972 partly because of his team's convention-floor machinations. The Tea Party's goals may be federal, but the groups themselves are grounded in local activism (and the occasional $200,000 campaign by the Club for Growth). So even if the movement doesn't give the Republican Party its next presidential candidate, it can still stage a slow takeover, one platform at a time. Like  Slate on Facebook. Follow us  on Twitter."

23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/05/oil_slick.html	"BP faces two crises. The first is stopping the spillage of 200,000 gallons of oil a day in the Gulf of Mexico. The other is convincing people it's trying to stop the spillage of 200,000 gallons of oil a day in the Gulf of Mexico. BP has long been famous for its public relations--in good ways and bad. Its ""Beyond Petroleum"" rebranding campaign, first launched in 2000, earned plaudits from the P.R. community. It also drew mockery from journalists and environmentalists who saw the campaign as ""greenwashing."" Now, in the midst of the biggest disaster of its disaster-laden history, BP is experimenting with new ways to get its message out. Its traditional efforts--official statements, press releases, morning-show interviews--have been hit or miss, according to crisis communications experts. But it appears to be having more success with social media. Since the initial explosion on the oil rig in April, BP has made some missteps. For example, the company initially told reporters that the rig was leaking 1,000 barrels of oil a day. The real figure turned out to be 5,000 barrels, after a new leak was discovered. Even then a BP spokesman downplayed the number as somewhere between 1,000 and 5,000. ""That hurt their credibility early on,"" says Timothy Coombs, who teaches public relations at Eastern Illinois University. ""People wondered, How much can we trust you?"" It also violated a rule that Larry Smith of the Institute for Crisis Management tells his clients: ""Don't speculate. If you know, say so. If you don't know, say you don't know."" Nor should BP have tried to deflect blame for the accident. Its first press release after the spill emphasized that the oil rig belonged to drilling contractor Transocean Ltd. and that BP offered its ""full support,"" implying that it wasn't at fault. The company also referred to the accident as the ""Gulf of Mexico oil spill,"" whereas others--including President Obama and the Environmental Protection Agency--called it the ""BP oil spill."" BP then tried to distinguish between blame for the accident and responsibility for cleaning up after it. ""It wasn't our accident,"" CEO Tony Hayward said on the Today show, ""but we are absolutely responsible for the oil, for cleaning it up."" That may be literally true: BP owns the oil but not the rig. But it's a shoddy communications strategy, says Smith. Wherever the fault lies, BP shouldn't be splitting hairs. Companies should take the fall and work out recriminations behind closed doors, says Coombs. For example, when the chain Taco Johns had an E. coli outbreak, it didn't publicly blame the lettuce supplier. It took responsibility. And, of course, sued the lettuce supplier later. BP also needs to grasp that though it may not be a villain, people perceive it that way. Hayward initially said that BP ""will honor all legitimate claims for business interruption."" A reporter asked what an illegitimate claim would look like. ""I could give you lots of examples,"" he said. ""This is America--come on. We're going to have lots of illegitimate claims. We all know that."" Michael W. Robinson of Levick Strategic Communications recommends a bit more self-awareness. ""You have to recognize that everyone, from fishermen to congressmen, is going to look at you with a jaundiced view,"" Robinson says. When it comes to social media and the Web, though, communications experts give BP high marks. BP created a section of its Web site dedicated to the spill, complete with photos, video, and maps that track the cleanup. ""I'd have to give it an A+,"" saysSmith. In one video, a sweaty, fatigued Hayward explains the cleanup while a roomful of busy-looking employees buzzes behind him, giving viewers a glimpse into the hectic cleanup process that they don't get from an interview with Katie Couric. Same with Deepwaterhorizonresponse.com, a new Web site created by the coalition of organizations pitching in to clean up the mess, including BP. The company also posts constant updates to its Twitter feed. Putting your propaganda on Twitter and Facebook doesn't make it any less propagandistic. But it does help a company respond faster and more precisely to new developments. When reports came out that BP was trying to get fishermen to sign waivers holding BP harmless from certain claims related to the cleanup, BP backpedaled on Twitter: ""We've assured fishermen's association that fishermen offering services are not required to sign a waiver. Any signed won't be enforced."" Twitter also helps build trust in small ways. For example, BP tweeted a hotline for people to call if they see oiled wildlife. BP isn't the first company to handle a crisis via new media. When two employees of Domino's Pizza posted a video that showed one of them sticking food up his nose, the company's president posted his apology on YouTube. Nestle, meanwhile, showed what not to do by snarkily responding to critics on its Facebook page. But BP appears to be embracing the more-is-better ethos of new media more than any other troubled company. ""The old saying is true: You can never overcommunicate in a crisis,"" says Robinson. By that measure, BP is doing just fine. Like  Slate on Facebook. Follow us  on Twitter."	What P.R. experts think of BP's response to the oil spill.	['Obama']	[]
24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/05/why_now.html	"Faisal Shahzad, the Pakistan-born American citizen arrested on suspicion of being Times Square's would-be May Day bomber, did not act alone. Reportedly he's told authorities he received bomb training in Waziristan, a Taliban and al-Qaida stronghold. In Pakistan, a man named Muhammad Rehan, who was seen with Shahzad on a recent visit, has been arrested; Rehan's mosque is reportedly linked to Jaish-e-Mohammed, the same al-Qaida affiliate that five young Muslim Americans from Alexandria, Va., contacted in Pakistan this past December, leading to their arrest. It would appear that a second shoe has dropped. In February 2009 I published a Slate series (""Why No More 9/11s?"") exploring various theories as to why the United States had never suffered another large-scale foreign terror attack after Sept. 11, 2001. I arranged the theories along an axis that ran from ""worry a little"" to ""worry a lot."" Most of the ""worry a lot"" theories (Bush kept us safe; it's all about electoral cycles), seemed reassuringly far-fetched, but the last and most worrisome theory, a time-space calculation by a couple of big-brained analysts at the Rand Corp., gave me pause. The ""space"" part of the calculation made the simple point that proximity to a violent extremist enemy and easy access to international borders increased your vulnerability to (hence frequency of) terror attacks. That's one reason why Israel (nearby and only 85 miles wide) suffers from terrorist attacks more frequently than the United States (far away and 3,000 miles wide). It's actually quite difficult to attack a sprawling country surrounded by ocean on the other side of the world. But the difficulty was not constant, because after  a country suffered a terrorist attack it was put on its guard--for instance by tightening its borders, stepping up its intelligence-gathering, and devoting military resources to tracking down and killing the enemy. We can argue about how well the United States has done that, and at what cost, but without question the nation rapidly became more difficult for terrorists to attack after Sept. 11 than it was before.

25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/04/a_guy_walks_into_an_oval_office.html	"When politicians tell jokes, some kill. Others kill their chances of ever becoming president. Perhaps the greatest flop in recent memory was a speech given by then-House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt in 1995 at the annual dinner hosted by the Gridiron Club in Washington. Gephardt came out wearing a Boy Scout uniform--he was an Eagle Scout--and pledged to ""clean up the image of Congress."" The response: silence. ""Nobody got it,"" remembers Eli Attie, who was then a speechwriter for Gephardt. ""Then he was just standing there in a Boy Scout uniform for the rest of the speech ... and you're looking at his pale, overexposed kneecaps. Which was funny on one level, but not the level we wanted."" The written jokes bombed, too. The next day's Washington Post described the performance as ""rife with wooden, slightly nasty attacks on Republicans"" that ""raised more eyebrows than smiles."" ""Dick's just not funny--everybody knows that,"" Gephardt's wife was quoted saying. ""I enjoyed your remarks, Dick,"" Bill Clinton said at the dinner. ""But you and I are in the minority."" Gephardt's speech broke all the rules of political joke-making--rules that Barack Obama and his team of joke writers would be wise to follow in Saturday's speech at the White House Correspondents Dinner. First, the obvious: Be self-deprecating. ""Humor is a powerful weapon,"" says Jeff Nussbaum, a speechwriter who has worked for Al Gore and Joe Biden. ""But to earn the right to wield it against others, you need to turn it against yourself first."" Gephardt made the mistake of going after Republicans without first winning over the audience. ""There wasn't that same goodwill,"" recalls Attie. ""He was a little too harsh on people."" Barack Obama grasps this. His 2009 speech was peppered with teleprompter jokes (""Pause for laughter,"" he said out loud), a bailout quip (""Car and Driver named me auto executive of the year""), and predictions about his second 100 days (""I will consider losing my cool""). Which then allowed him to mock everyone around him. He noted that Michael Steele was ""in the heezy."" He previewed Dick Cheney's memoirs, How to Shoot Friends and Interrogate People. He called John Boehner a ""person of color."" The whole time, Obama seemed to be half-chuckling to himself. ""That gave him little sense of ironic distance,"" remembers Attie. ""Like, Here is this exercise we assemble here to do."" The second rule (and the motto of the Gridiron Club itself): Singe, don't burn. The best jokes walk right up to the line--but don't cross it. ""You never want get an oooo out of the audience,"" says Jeff Shesol, a former deputy speechwriter for Bill Clinton. ""I can't believe you just said that is pretty good, but oooo is different."" Gentle ribbing is good. At last year's WHCD, Obama welcomed his audience of journalists. ""Most of you covered me,"" he said. ""All of you voted for me."" (This year, jokes about the media's love affair with Obama aren't as relevant.) Some speeches do push the limits of decorum. Someone who attended this year's off-the-record Alfalfa dinner recalls a senator telling a joke about Peter Orszag, the OMB director whose girlfriend gave birth in 2009: ""Peter Orszag proved himself adept at juggling the country's finances,"" the joke went. ""In the end, he managed the bailout, but he didn't manage the pullout."" The crowd loved it. ""You could actually see the house coming down, chunks of plaster landing in the lobster bisque,"" recalls the attendee. Burns do occur. Lines get crossed. In 2004, New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine hired Nussbaum to write some jokes for a speech at a Washington Press Club Foundation dinner. Nussbaum sent him a few ideas, including this one: ""Sharing a media market with Chuck Schumer is like sharing a banana with a monkey. Take a little bite of it, and he will throw his own feces at you."" Nussbaum didn't expect Corzine to use it, he says. But Corzine did. Schumer demanded an apology. ""It soured the relationship between the two of them,"" Nussbaum says.""You forget that something that was funny in a small room isn't funny in a big room."" The most notorious line-crossers are the hired entertainment. Stephen Colbert's send-up of President Bush and Washington journalism at the WHCD in 2006 got a chilly response from the audience, including the president himself. But it was nothing compared to the backlash against Don Imus when he hosted the White House Radio and TV Correspondents Dinner in 1996. ""He told one blowjob joke after another, standing ten feet from the president and nine-and-a-half feet from the first lady,"" recalls Christopher Buckley, who wrote speeches for George H.W. Bush. ""It was excruciating."" Perhaps that's better than the alternative: Ben Stein's address to the Radio and TV dinner in 2001, which included an assassination joke on the eve of the 20th anniversary of the shooting of Ronald Reagan in the hotel where it happened, redefined unfunny. ""The audience simply stopped listening to him about half way through,"" recalls Buckley. Which brings us to the third rule: Use jokes as damage control. Clinton never made light of the Lewinsky scandal directly. But in 1999, he started off his WHCD speech by somberly noting that had the Senate's impeachment vote gone another way, he wouldn't be standing here today. Pause. ""I demand a recount."" The quip not only defused the tension surrounding the Lewinsky affair. It also captured Clinton's messy relationship with the press. The damage control strategy can backfire. Al Gore often joked about his stiffness--""Al Gore is so stiff, racks buy their suits off him;"" ""Al Gore is so boring, his Secret Service code name is Al Gore""--until his speechwriters realized they were only reinforcing the image. A joke exploded in the face of George W. Bush when he cut a video for the 2004 Radio and TV dinner. In it, he was shown peering under furniture in the Oval Office. ""Those weapons of mass destruction have got to be here somewhere,"" he quipped. People laughed, but by Monday the press had decided it was in poor taste. And of course there's Rule No. 4: Delivery matters. John Kerry learned this the hard way in 2006, when he botched a joke in front of a group of students. He meant to say that if you don't study hard, you'll end up making dumb decisions like President Bush's decision to invade Iraq. Instead, he said that students who don't perform well would get ""stuck in Iraq."" The best political comedy speeches are a mix of punchlines, extended riffs, and set pieces. Punchlines are relatively easy. White House speechwriters usually solicit ideas from funny people around the West Wing--apparently David Axelrod is a comedic force--as well as TV writers and professional comedians. Clinton and Gore, for example, relied heavily on Al Franken and Jay Leno. Other times they'll simply pay an outside writer to do it. The initial ""joke dump"" then gets whittled down to the gems, which one or two speechwriters craft into a speech. They also try to come up with a few riffs--see Obama's series of jokes about his second 100 days--that play to the politician's personality. The strongest gags, however, are often the set pieces. When Gore headlined the Gridiron in the '90s, he had recently told FBI investigators that he had not been part of certain controversial fundraising discussions because he'd had a lot of iced tea to drink and had taken many bathroom breaks. So he began his speech by chugging a tall glass of iced tea, hiking his pants, and saying, ""I can't stay long."" Writing jokes for politicians is different from writing for a late-night talk show. (Although sometimes the two overlap.) ""For a politician, it's not just about getting laughs,"" says Eric Schnure, a speechwriter who has written for both Democrats and Republicans. ""It's about being liked."" Some humor is therefore off limits. No impersonations. No joking about loss of life. No cursing. It's just not worth offending someone you have to work with the next day. The best jokes often make a point. In his book  The Political Speechwriter's Companion, Robert Lehrman highlights one story politicians love to tell about the man who orders rabbit stew at a restaurant and ""complains to the manager that it tastes like horse meat. The manager confesses he did put some horse meat in the stew. 'How much?' 'It's equally divided. One horse, one rabbit.' "" It's funny, but it also makes a point about the unevenness of political compromise. Luckily for speechwriters, the bar isn't that high. Even the lamest jokes get laughs. ""The weird thing about all these jokes is, none of them are funny,"" says one Senate speechwriter. It's more about seeing normally stentorian politicians crack wise. The mere fact of it is entertaining. As Attie puts it: ""It's humor in a suit."" Like Slate on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter."	How political speechwriters do comedy.

26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/04/escape_from_the_echo_chamber.html	"Maybe democracy will survive the Internet after all. Many hands have been wrung over the supposed tendency for consumers of online news to seek out sites that validate their own political opinions. Like minds, the theory goes, surf alike. But, as David Brooks noted, this may not be the case. A recent paper by two researchers from the University of Chicago suggests that, when it comes to online news, we aren't nearly as isolated as we think. The paper's authors, Matthew Gentzkow and Jesse Shapiro, studied the readership of 112 high-traffic news and politics Web sites. Using data collected by the Web analytics firm comScore, Gentzkow and Shapiro analyzed the surfing habits of about 12,000 people who had identified their political affiliation. (Conservatives and liberals were the only types counted in the study; self-described moderates and independents were not included.) They then gave each Web site a score based on the political leanings of its readers. Their conclusion: Many people go to sites whose readers don't share their politics. To use their terminology, they found a low degree of ""media isolation"" among Web surfers compared with the political isolation most Americans experience in their daily lives. Stacked against the networks in which we work, live, and socialize, the network we increasingly use to get our news--which is to say, the one you are using right now--is relatively integrated. Part of the reason may be that the more partisan Web sites attract a pretty small audience. The visualization at the bottom of the page illustrates this point. Each square represents a Web site. A square's size is relative to its audience, while a square's color is relative to its audience's politics. A major news portal like Yahoo News has a relatively balanced readership--about 55 percent of its readers say they are conservative, and 45 percent say they are liberal--so it's shaded a neutral gray. An international site like BBC News, with only 22 percent of readers identifying themselves as conservative, is deep blue. (Apparently, more liberals than conservatives want their news from across the Atlantic.) Dragging the bars at the top of the map allows you to see how an audience's size and its politics play off each other. The visualization shows that few sites have a balanced audience. While behemoths like Yahoo News and CNN have a fairly even readership, even ostensibly balanced, mainstream media brands like the New York Times, USA Today, and ABC News have an audience that tips to one side of the spectrum. (Because more Americans self-identify as conservatives than as liberals, sites are more likely to tilt to the right.) But that doesn't necessarily mean their news is slanted. The study assesses a site's readers, not its content. Slatewants to help you discover your own isolation index. So we've created a little program that allows you to see for yourself how open-minded you are--at least according to your browsing history. Here's how it works: When you click on the ""Profile Me"" button, we will check which news sites you've visited recently. Then, using the same Web site rankings Gentzkow and Shapiro used in their research, we'll tell you how ""isolated"" you are. Before you click, you should know that you will remain completely anonymous--we have no clue who you are--and we do not download your browsing history. We simply check whether you've visited the home page of each of the sites listed in the study. (It works much like sites that guess your gender.) A full list of the publications and Web site addresses we check for is here. We do not save the information, just your overall score, which will be used solely to compare you to other Slate readers, shown in the graph below the button. Remember: This isn't about your own political views--it's about those of your fellow readers. So if your online diet only consists of the Drudge Report, the  New York Post, and HotAir.com, you're going to come across as pretty isolated. If you make occasional forays to the New York Times and Huffington Post, you'll seem catholic. Our calculations don't include how long you spent on each page--only that you've been. The main drawback to this methodology, of course--which, Gentzkow and Shapiro acknowledge--is that they (and we) have no idea what you think of what you read. When you read a columnist that you vehemently disagree with--Paul Krugman, say, or Karl Rove--you get credit for exposing yourself to the other side. Maybe you come away with a renewed respect for the opposing argument. Or maybe the experience only reinforces the opinions you already hold. That's a question to be answered by another study--or in the comments. Like  Slate on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	Slate's interactive test of how open-minded your news diet is.	[]	[]

Charlie Crist is widely expected to announce tomorrow that he will drop out of the Republican Senate primary to run as an independent. Crist's decision to go his own way raises a set of interesting political questions: Can he win? Will Kendrick Meek, the Democratic candidate, benefit? Will this intraparty feud in Florida affect the Republican Party nationally? These questions are yet to be answered. One verdict is in, however. The political rules of hugging have changed. Crist's downfall in the Republican Party is often clocked from the moment he hugged President Obama in February 2009. Obama, in the early stages of his attempt to reach out to the other party, praised Crist's support of his stimulus spending during a Florida visit, and the governor praised right back. The hug alone wasn't where Crist's transgressions began or ended, of course. But it became a powerful symbol that opponents within the Republican Party used against him. (His opponent launched a Web fundraising page with the picture and a caption that read ""Get the picture?"") The public presidential hug has a mysterious power. Once upon a time it worked mostly for good. Civilians who get one beam like they've been drinking. At party fundraisers, it's proof that the senator or representative is thisclose to the most powerful man in the world. In town-hall meetings, it can show the president cares--whether it's Barack Obama comforting a woman who can't get health care coverage or George Bush comforting the daughter of a 9/11 victim. (The most famous presidential hug, between President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, was a special case.) But starting with Sen. Joe Lieberman, the hug became political poison. Democrats used his embrace of George W. Bush, and Bush's peck on the cheek, to help force the Connecticut senator out of the party in 2006. Democrats used John McCain's hug with George Bush to show that his claims to being a maverick were hollow. (Now McCain won't even hug himself). Hugging is so fraught with danger that even Sen. Tom Coburn, the Oklahoma Republican whose conservative bona fides are beyond question, received critical letters when he hugged Obama before the State of the Union in January. Hugging body language will get careful consideration this election year. Today, for example, Obama visited two states with key Senate races. In Illinois, he was on stage with Alexi Giannoulias, a longtime friend who could use a big public hug. He's in a tough race, and Obama is popular in the state he once represented. The problem is that Giannoulias is a little toxic. His family bank, where he worked for four years, was just closed by the FDIC. For now, the hugging was reserved for the rope line after the event. In Missouri the president is not as popular. When Obama was in town last March, Democratic senatorial candidate Robin Carnahan didn't join him at a health care reform event, robbing her opponents of a picture. That didn't matter to the local Republican Party, which released a picture of the two of them from six years earlier. On Wednesday, Carnahan did attend the Obama event--but the two were never visibly in hugging range. Like so much else in politics, hugging is a lot more complicated than it used to be. In an effort to understand this evolving and important story, and as a public service, I have compiled a short list of some types and levels of political hugging. Feel free to add your own. The huggee who doesn't want to be hugged: John McCain and George Bush. The huggee who regrets it later: Joe Lieberman and George Bush. The huggers who should be but aren't comfortable: McCain and Palin. The huggers who want to, but shouldn't: Bill Clinton and Monica. The hug heard 'round the world: Hillary Clinton and Suha Arafat. The huggers who should probably get a room: Tipper and Al Gore. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter."

Devising a strategy for 2010 has therefore been relatively simple: Let's see that again! Not exactly that, of course. Midterm elections aren't like other elections. The president's not on the ballot, for one thing. They're also smaller and more fractured, and they usually don't work out well for the party in power. Democrats have therefore devised a strategy that seems geared to recreate 2008 under 2010 conditions: Bring back the old team. Barack Obama! David Plouffe! Mitch Stewart! Tim Kaine, sorta! The gang is all here, fired up and readier than ever to tie Republicans to George W. Bush. The Obama team lost some of its stars in the wake of the election, most notably (and vocally) former deputy campaign manager Steve Hildebrand. But the core members are still around, wielding the almighty List that allowed them to target likely supporters. Nationalize the election. Every off-year election, the party in charge must decide whether to ""nationalize"" the race--that is, make it about the president and his administration--or to let each candidate distance himself from national issues. It usually depends on the president's ratings. In 2002, a year after 9/11, Bush was so popular that just about every Republican candidate tied himself to the president. The GOP picked up seven House seats and two in the Senate. In 2006, when Bush's ratings were near their all-time low, Republicans ran from him, and Democrats retook both chambers. Team Obama is going national. On Monday, Obama's campaign arm released a video kicking off ""Vote 2010,"" the Democratic effort to turn out as many of the voters who helped elect Obama in 2008 as possible. Obama's national job approval rating hovers around 48 percent. But he's still popular enough among Democrats--the voters who turned out in droves to vote for him--that he would help rather than hurt. But don't nationalize it too much. Democrats are aware that Obama isn't popular everywhere. ""We're interested in doing what's helpful,"" says Lynda Tran, a spokesperson for Organizing for America, the grass-roots group that is the successor to the Obama campaign organization. ""We always want to be a value add."" If a Democrat doesn't want help from Obama--because he's in a district that elected McCain, say, or that has been skeptical about health care reform--he doesn't have to take it. The type of activism may also differ by district. Places that are more Obama-friendly are more likely to hold big rallies featuring the president, for example, while redder areas might focus on quiet outreach like e-mails or phone calls. Bring back the ""surge."" Obama credits his success in large part to first-time voters-- ""the young people, African-Americans, Latinos, and women who powered our victory in 2008,"" he says in the new video. Winning in 2010 means turning first-time voters into second-time voters. There's the usual door-knocking and sign-waving. But this time, Democrats also have some ""pretty sophisticated modeling and targeting,"" says Tran, based in part on data collected in 2008. When Dede Scozzafava dropped out of the House race in New York's 23rd District, for example, OFA knew which individual voters were most likely to switch sides and targeted them aggressively. (It seemed to work; Bill Owens won.) In 2010, Democrats have a good sense of who the likely Obama voters are. It's just a matter of getting them to the polls. Play up popular policies ...  Out: bailouts. In: job creation. A lot happened during Obama's first year, but Democrats will be emphasizing only part of it. The $800 billion stimulus package may have been necessary, but that doesn't make it popular. Democrats will probably leave that out of their campaign literature. Regulatory reform, on the other hand--poll-tested and christened ""Wall Street reform""--enjoys wide support. If it passes, Democrats will brag. Somewhere in the middle is health care reform. Democrats insist that the more Americans learn about it, the more they like it. But polls show skepticism lingering even after the legislation passed. ... And promise new ones. Democrats are building a raft of 2010-friendly policies. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid started by promising to pass immigration reform this year--a convenient priority for Reid, who is facing re-election in a state whose population is 25 percent Hispanic. A bank tax also appears to be in the works. And Democrats will likely extend the Bush tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans. The beauty of fighting for these policies is that even if Democrats lose, they win. The reason all this matters is not so much 2010 as 2012. Sure, Democrats are poised to lose seats in November. But even Michael Steele has said he's skeptical Republicans will take back the House. From an organizational standpoint, this year's election is really a dress rehearsal for the next presidential election: an opportunity for Team Obama--and Team Steele--to see which strategies work and which don't."

29	29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/04/gently_gently.html	"President Obama gave his big speech about financial reform in New York City today. If he had wanted to be as dramatic as he was in his State of the Union address in January, when he called out the Supreme Court justices for their ruling allowing more corporate money in campaigns, he had opportunity. Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, was in the audience. Goldman has spent $1.15 million on lobbying in the first quarter of 2010, compared with $670,000 in the first quarter of 2009. Imagine if the president had turned to Blankfein and said, ""Lloyd, knock it off."" Sure, Blankfein leads a firm whose employees have given a lot to Obama and Democratic politicians. But that would only have added to the drama. It didn't happen. Yes, Obama took note of ""the furious effort of industry lobbyists"" and asked ""the titans of industry"" to stop ""fighting us."" But it was all very collegial. In the end, Obama was pretty soft on Wall Street bankers. ""Some on Wall Street forgot that behind every dollar traded or leveraged there is a family looking to buy a house, or pay for an education, open a business, save for retirement,"" he said. ""What happens on Wall Street has real consequences across the country, across our economy."" In the scale of Obama opprobrium this is less of a rebuke than his recent treatment of Sen. Mitch McConnell, or his comments about the Supreme Court's ruling on the Citizens United case. Obama's concern Thursday was pretty much just getting this legislation passed.  Wall Street must be responsible and stop trying to block the legislation, he said. Once new regulations are in place, according to the logic of his speech, those on Wall Street who ignore or forget the consequences of their actions will pay a price. Largely missing from his speech, however, was any notion that Wall Street bankers should seek a higher standard whether or not there's a referee on the field. Maybe this would have sounded like lecturing, and it's almost certainly naive. Also, in an economic downturn, it's probably wise not to beat up on Wall Street too much (which is why Obama was at pains throughout the speech to point out that he believed in the market). But Obama's inaugural address was all about a ""new era of responsibility""--and so at some point, he should call for it. In this case, isn't the natural request to ask Wall Street banks not only to stop lobbying but to avoid waking up the day after the legislation is passed and looking for loopholes? Or to spend a little less time and effort on financial instruments that, as Andrew Ross Sorkin pointed out this week, have zero social good? A senior administration official argues that Obama has made this moral case before but that at this point it was important not to heap on the abuse but to make a call for a very specific kind of responsibility:"	Why Barack Obama wasn't that tough on Wall Street.
