What we do know confounds our model of mass shootings. Most of the time, we have a single, male shooter. Here, we have two killers, one man and one woman: Syed Rizwan Farook, 28, and Tashfeen Malik, 27. They were married, with a child. The shooting was planned--Farook and Malik had highly deadly assault weapons, pipe bombs, and a (failed) strategy for avoiding police--but they didn't leave an explanation and there's no obvious motive.* This lack of information hasn't stopped anyone from speculating about the shooting and its intended purpose. ""At this point, the details of what happened in San Bernardino are still unclear,"" said a careful Ted Cruz during his address to the Republican Jewish Coalition on Thursday. ""But our prayers are with the families of those who were murdered and those who were shot. And all of us are deeply concerned that this is yet another manifestation of terrorism, radical Islamic terrorism here at home."" South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, at the same gathering, was more blunt. This shooting, he said, ""was about two people who have bought into an ideology that's just absolutely insane."" More circumspect was President Obama. ""We do not yet know why this terrible event occurred,"" Obama said in a statement from the Oval Office. ""It's possible this was terrorist-related, but we don't know."" The investigation--into the nature of the shooting--is just beginning (the FBI is probing the shooters' potential links to terrorists). But at least one thing is clear: Whether it's terrorism or not, Democrats want to make this an argument about gun control. ""I refuse to accept this as normal,"" said Hillary Clinton in a Twitter message on Wednesday. ""We must take action to stop gun violence now."" Her rival, Bernie Sanders, followed suit. ""Mass shootings are becoming an almost-everyday occurrence in this country,"" he said. ""This sickening and senseless gun violence must stop."" And Martin O'Malley made a direct attack on the influential National Rifle Association. ""Enough is enough: it's time to stand up to the NRA and enact meaningful gun safety laws,"" he said. Mass shootings have become frequent enough that this rhetoric is now boilerplate. Of course Democrats are going to call for gun control in the wake of a massacre. Conservatives, citing the long drop in violent crime, are skeptical that we need new laws. But even with crime at an almost 50-year low, the United States still has an unusual--and startling--level of gun homicide. So, the question for Democrats now should be what kind of gun control do they want? Mass shootings, while awful, are just a fraction of overall gun homicides, and a gun plan pegged to these black swan events may fail to touch the main sources of violence: suicide, gun accidents, and inner-city homicide. What have the three Democratic candidates proposed to address gun violence, and what kinds of violence would their platforms actually tackle? The good--if politically tricky--news is that, across the board, Democratic gun control proposals seem targeted at the types of violence that are far more common than mass shootings. Clinton has a three-pronged plan. First, there are background checks. As president, she would hope to sign comprehensive federal background check legislation and close such loopholes for gun show and Internet sales. On the supply-side, her plan calls for repealing the law that prevents victims of gun violence from suing manufacturers and dealers, and backing punitive action against ""bad-actor"" dealers that ""knowingly supply straw purchasers and traffickers."" She would also seek to limit access to guns among the mentally ill--specifically people ""involuntarily committed to outpatient treatment""--and make straw purchasing a federal crime. O'Malley has a similar approach, drawn from his experience in Maryland. He wants expanded background checks, an end to ""unregulated internet gun and ammunition sales""--which seems especially apt given the huge amount of ammunition held by the San Bernardino shooters--and greater information sharing between states, so that a background check in Virginia, for instance, is useful to authorities in Oregon. Beyond background checks, O'Malley wants fingerprint-licensing and safety training for all gun purchases, including private sales by licensed dealers; a national age requirement for handgun possession; required safety standards for gun storage; and pushback against concealed-carry laws. To fight gun crime and domestic violence, he wants to ban gun ownership for people convicted of domestic violence in any relationship, as well as gun ownership for people subject to emergency restraining orders. He'll also push a national firearms registry, mandatory reporting of lost or stolen firearms, and ""microstamping""--a unique code stamped onto a cartridge case--for all guns, to help law enforcement trace weapons involved in crime. And like Clinton, he'd punish dealers who break the law and expand penalties for gun traffickers. Bernie Sanders hasn't released a package for gun control, but his campaign is crafting one, and judging from the present environment in the Democratic Party, it will likely hew to the Clinton and O'Malley models. With that said, Democrats should be honest as they tout their plans for gun control: The odds they'll accomplish any of this are not good. Even if elected president, any Democrat would have to have a full Democratic Congress, which is highly unlikely, barring a sui generis event like a Donald Trump nomination in the Republican primary. Even with a Democratic Congress, it's not clear there's a full party consensus on the kind of gun control the country needs. And if, somehow, legislation came to the floor of this hypothetical Democratic-controlled Senate, Democrats would still need to beat a likely Republican filibuster (assuming the filibuster still exists). Still, these plans are important. They tell us where the candidates' priorities lie, and they tie each figure to a promise. If elected president, any of these Democrats would try to accomplish something on guns. As for the plans themselves, the good news--for supporters of gun control, at least-- is that they likely would do something about the most common causes of gun homicide: accidents, suicide, and crime. When guns come with safety requirements, children and others are less likely to be harmed in handling them. When they are harder to obtain, it's harder to act on suicidal impulses. And with a crackdown on straw purchases, illegal sales, and unscrupulous dealers, it's more difficult for criminals to obtain weapons. Put simply, with higher barriers to gun ownership, less people will buy guns. And fewer guns means fewer deaths. The bad news is that, even under this regime for gun control, the San Bernardino shooting is still possible. The shooters, after all, bought their guns legally. That doesn't mean, for gun control supporters, that these policies aren't worth pursuing. But it does mean Democrats should be careful about linking gun control to mass shootings. The United States has always had more homicide than its peers. And by definition, a large, relatively violent country with a substantial number of armed citizens is prone to events like Wednesday's killings. We can reduce the frequency of mass shootings, but absent a full gun ban, there's just no avoiding them entirely.

1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/congress_to_repeal_obamacare_in_soon_to_be_vetoed_charade.html	"The meticulously plotted Republican plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act and have that repeal vetoed by President Obama culminates this week. The House of Representatives has voted to eliminate the law dozens of times over the last few Congresses, but either Democratic control of the Senate or Democrats' use of the filibuster has kept the repeal from going any further. So after last year's midterm elections, in which the GOP gained control of the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell agreed to use the reconciliation process to get the repeal over the finish line. (Reconciliation is the one-off parliamentary maneuver that only requires a 51-vote majority.) After an expected marathon of votes on dumb amendments heading into Thursday, the bill should pass, paving the way for Obama to veto the dickens out of it. Republicans are going through the Kabuki of passing a doomed bill for a number of reasons. Once it became clear that this Congress wasn't going to use reconciliation to pass anything that could make its way into law, the GOP decided that it might as well burn the reconciliation tool on a messaging bill. The message here is to clarify to Republican voters, ahead of the presidential election, that all they need to eliminate the ghastly scourge of expanded access to medical care is a new, conservative butt in the Oval Office swivel chair. As useless messaging bills go, you could do worse. (Though, it's worth pointing out that this bill should also send a message to the Democratic base to show up and vote if they want to save the Affordable Care Act.) This reconciliation process has been carried out as the trial run for an actual ACA repeal after the 2016 elections, as Republican legislators have done reconnaissance on all the procedural traps that might occur for the real deal. By those standards it's been largely successful. Though the bill will not be a total repeal, it does eliminate much of the law's core infrastructure, its revenues and its outlays, even if it can't weed out every last regulation under reconciliation, because some don't directly pertain to the budget. The question this process hasn't resolved, though, is this: How comfortable will Republicans be passing such legislation when it actually has the potential to become law? While the trial run has clarified how to surpass the various procedural hurdles toward repeal, it's also exposed the difficult political considerations Republicans will have to take into account if and when they get their chance to do it for real. Two political considerations that will give some Republicans the most pause in a hypothetical joint effort with a Republican president are the central pillars to the law: the Medicaid expansion and subsidies for purchasing insurance plans on government-established private insurance exchanges. A reconciliation repeal bill that the House passed in October eliminated the most unpopular parts of the bill, like the individual and employer mandates, but it did not touch either the Medicaid expansion or the subsidies. The political problem here was fairly straightforward: Voters (""people"") don't like having their health insurance taken away. Conservative Sens. Marco Rubio, Mike Lee, and Ted Cruz, along with pressure groups like Heritage Action, rejected the House-passed bill as a cowardly dodge that broke a promise to voters who demanded full repeal. After some hesitation, McConnell decided to include repeal of the Medicaid expansion (over the course of a two-year phaseout period) and the subsidies into the package. Heritage and the hold-out senators appeared to be satisfied. But now Republicans at the other end of the spectrum aren't, according to Politico: ""[A] number of Republican senators from states that have expanded Medicaid voiced concerns about the message the party would be sending to the thousands of constituents that would lose their health care under the GOP's bill."" Indeed: Repealing Obamacare would involve repealing Obamacare. But McConnell and his team were able to soothe these fears with a comical reply: Don't worry, it's not like this repeal that we so desperately claim to want will become law. ""[S]enators were reminded,"" Politico reported, ""that the president would veto the repeal bill anyway, meaning Republicans could vote on the measure without having to deal with the political risks of actually making major changes to existing law."" And Sen. John McCain, speaking at an event Wednesday morning, said that he ""would probably vote for"" the package, even though ""it does provide me with discomfort."" Not quite the discomfort that poor people would feel once their newly received access to medical care is snatched away, but discomfort, sure. The theory of the dry run that probably couldn't pass as a real run is that by 2017, Republicans won't have to worry as much about the consequences of revoking peoples' bennies because, by then, they'll have an adequate replacement plan ready to go. Will they, though? It's been nearly six years since the ACA passed, and Republicans have been promising for all that time that they'll have an Obamacare replacement plan ready ... soon. They've had trouble agreeing on a comprehensive alternative around which all factions of the party can rally, though. It's not because they lack the proper imagination. It's because covering the same number of people that the ACA covers without spending much money is an extremely difficult task. Republicans are on the cusp of showing that they're procedurally capable of repealing most of the ACA should they unify control of the federal government in next year's election, but they've also revealed that they're far from politically committed. We're already witnessing on the state level what happens when Republicans who campaign on undoing the Medicaid expansion arrive in a position to do so: They get cold feet. If Republicans in 2017 are finally able to gut the law, they'll have to make a choice: Suffer the political consequences of taking away health coverage from millions, or suffer the political consequences of breaking a central promise to the Republican base. Neither sounds particularly fun."	The GOP Is Finally Passing Obamacare Repeal. It Will Be a Charade on Multiple Levels.
2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/is_robert_lewis_dear_another_john_brown.html	"The rampage against a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood clinic last week resurfaced a familiar argument in recent American politics: When does language go too far? For pro-choice activists, this is easy: The more heated the rhetoric from anti-abortion groups, the greater the odds that someone does something violent. Not only was the alleged assailant, Robert Lewis Dear, an isolated, unstable man with a history of violence against women, but according to one person--who gave an anonymous account to the New York Times--the 57-year-old had previously ""praised people who attacked abortion providers, saying they were doing 'God's work.' "" If language incites, then Dear was primed and ready, and now three people are dead and nine wounded in another attack on an abortion provider. But pro-life groups disagree. Instead, they see the murderous act of a single disturbed man, disconnected from rhetoric in the abortion debate. The National Right to Life Committee said it ""unequivocally condemns unlawful activities and acts of violence regardless of motivation."" Likewise, Tony Perkins of the conservative Family Research Council said, ""Only through peaceful means--not violence--can we truly become a nation that once again values all human life, born and unborn."" Speaking to BuzzFeed News, Eric Scheidler of the Pro-Life Action League voiced his dismay with accusations of blame. ""It's extremely frustrating, and I don't see anything we could possibly do,"" he said. ""Like anyone, he's going to pick up on the news of the day but what he does with the news is beyond our control. I don't know how we're going to fight abortion without talking about it."" He continued: ""Should William Lloyd Garrison have kept quiet about slavery because of madmen like John Brown?"" That's a big question. And an important one. Even if it's an idle comment, by raising the specter of John Brown, Scheidler sheds light on the key tension in this discussion, which goes beyond--but is tied to--the question of rhetoric. When John Brown led his brutal attack on pro-slavery settlers along the Pottawatomie Creek in southeastern Kansas in 1856, slavery was fully entrenched in American life. Slave-grown exports fueled the American economy, from Southern plantations to Northern industry and speculation. The internal slave trade made fortunes for entreprenuers in Baltimore; Norfolk, Virginia; Charleston, South Carolina; and other port cities. Roger B. Taney, a pro-slavery judge, was chief justice of the Supreme Court, and pro-slavery Democrats were poised to nominate James Buchanan for the presidency. (He would win, and do nothing to keep the country from war.) And six years earlier, Congress had passed a new Fugitive Slave Act, which fully federalized slave catching. Now, under threat of fines or jail time, state officials and citizens in the North had to return escaped blacks to enslavers and their agents. Brown looked at the United States and saw an empire of bondage, in deep defiance of God's will. By the time he took to Kansas, he saw violence as the only thing that might chasten the country and move it from its path. ""Without the shedding of blood,"" said Brown, quoting the biblical letter to the Hebrews, ""there is no remission of sin."" Brown killed five people at Pottawatomie, all to ""strike terror into the hearts of the pro-slavery party."" Three years later--after Taney's Supreme Court wrote black inferiority into the Constitution--Brown struck at the federal armory at Harpers Ferry, under a plan to arm slaves and spark a mass revolt. For Brown, the United States government had forfeited his loyalty by facilitating--and even protecting--mass evil. If it took violence to force a reckoning, then violence would have to happen. ""I believe that to have interfered as I have done, as I have always freely admitted I have done, in behalf of his despised poor, I did not wrong but right,"" he said, in his final address to the court that condemned him. In the aftermath of Harpers Ferry, abolitionists distanced themselves from Brown, but they didn't disavow him. Not completely. ""I am ever ready to write, speak, publish, organize, combine, and even to conspire against slavery,"" said Frederick Douglass, ""when there is a reasonable hope of success. Men who live by robbing their fellow-men of their labor and liberty have ... voluntarily placed themselves beyond the laws of justice and honor, and have become only fitted for companionship with thieves and pirates."" Douglass opposed Brown's methods but not his goals. Robert Dear is not John Brown; he's not, as far as we know, an anti-abortion activist, and he's not involved in any movement. But his intense and violent form of religiosity is also not far from the infamous figure, especially if you accept an analogy between slavery and abortion. Indeed, if actual anti-abortion activists style themselves abolitionists--and they do--then what relationship should they have to a figure like Dear, who seems to have killed in service of a shared goal (""no more baby parts"")? After all, abolitionist isn't just a label for anti-abortion activists--it's a cause that many conservatives embrace. ""America's cognitive dissonance in its approach to slavery was so intense as to provoke dissolution of the union and war,"" wrote Ian Tuttle for the National Review this past summer. ""The abortion debate does not threaten that sort of fracture, but it is every bit as urgent a question of justice, of fidelity to our fundamental tenets."" His colleague David French echoed this comparison in October: ""Abortion is worse than slavery, abortionists are worse than slave owners, and America needs to hear that bracing truth."" If you hold this view, then modern-day America is essentially criminal. Not only does it defend abortion in its Constitution--as interpreted by the Supreme Court--but it facilitates it and has a whole politics built around it, bolstered by one of its two major political parties. No, pro-life groups and activists don't have to embrace Dear any more than anti-slavery activists had to embrace Brown. But they also can't ignore the real tension between their disdain for the Planned Parenthood shooter and their sincere belief that abortion is the moral analogue to slavery, if not its more depraved sibling. If violence isn't appropriate in their eyes now--in the face of such an apparent depravity--then when is it? For what it's worth, it's hard to say that anti-slavery abolitionists ever resolved this tension. On one end, again, was Douglass, who put some distance between himself and Brown. On the other was Garrison, who on the day of Brown's death, carried his torch forward. ""God forbid that we should any longer continue the accomplices of thieves and robbers, of men-stealers and women-whippers,"" he declared. ""We must join together in the name of freedom."" Sixteen months later, the Confederate States fired on Fort Sumter. Events--a bloody and catastrophic war--eventually solved what reasoning could not. This leaves our anti-abortion ""abolitionists"" to answer for themselves the question that's vexed Americans since John Brown was hanged: ""When, if ever, do we bring violence in the face of evil at home?"" Since, as long as slavery is their touchstone, they can't avoid it."	If You View Abortion as Slavery, Does That Make Robert Dear Like John Brown?
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/american_military_if_we_want_to_contain_russia_we_need_to_spend_more.html	"One day after Slate published my column on why the United States needs a more capable and more expensive military, a group of terrorists launched a series of coordinated attacks in Paris that left dozens of innocent people dead and wounded. Spending more on the U.S. military will not mean the end of mass-casualty terror attacks, and anyone who tells you otherwise is mistaken. But it is also foolish to believe that such attacks would cease if the U.S. and its allies were to withdraw from the wider world. Threats that emerge in one part of the world can quickly spread to another. There is no going back to a world in which we can wall ourselves off from foreign threats, if there ever was such a world. Whether we like it or not, we have a stake in the success of Libya and Yemen, both of which are in the midst of bloody civil wars that have been overshadowed by the Syrian conflict. Jihadist groups feed on the chaos and dislocation caused by these conflicts, and the violence that results has a way of spilling over into Western societies. When states collapse in West Africa, severe epidemics like the Ebola outbreaks of 2014 grow more likely, as does the prospect of their spread to cities like London and New York. When a devastating earthquake hits Haiti, and when a tsunami leads to tens of thousands of deaths in the Indian Ocean rim, families are uprooted, some of whom then become migrants looking for a home. If a nuclear war were to break out between Pakistan and India, the consequences for the world, and for the environment we all share, would be dire. That is why the United States must concern itself with more than defending the homeland against invasion, or avenging Americans killed in terror attacks. We have a vested interest in building up the defense and governance capabilities of vulnerable countries around the world, and in ensuring that minor conflicts don't become major conflagrations. Of course, the U.S. can't be everywhere and do everything, nor should it. But because the U.S. is an affluent, populous, and dynamic society situated far away from rival powers, it is in a unique position to make selective investments that can have a disproportionately positive impact on global security. No one is calling for the U.S. to double its military spending, or even to return military spending to the 5 percent or more of GDP that was common in the Cold War era. Serious advocates of higher military spending are focused on far more modest goals. When I first called for a bigger U.S. defense budget, I argued that one reason the U.S. spends so much more than other countries is that the U.S. military aims to do far more than the militaries of other countries. Apart from defending U.S. territory, the most important thing the American military strives to do is deter rival powers from coercing and dominating weaker states, especially our allies. It is important to understand that deterring rival powers, like Russia, China, and Iran, is about more than spending more on the military than they do. It is about ensuring that military resources are in the right place at the right time. Consider the case of Russia. The U.S. spends far more on its military than Russia does, but Russia has pursued a military-modernization effort that is focused not on defeating the U.S. on all fronts but rather on achieving temporary military superiority in its near abroad, and then ending the conflicts it starts on favorable terms. In the latest issue of Survival, defense analysts Elbridge Colby and Jonathan Solomon assess the threat Russia poses to NATO members in the Baltics and in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as to other friendly countries like Finland and Sweden. Though Colby and Solomon are confident that the U.S. and its allies could defeat Russia in a long-term conventional war, they argue that Russia's goal wouldn't be to prevail in a conflict that stretches on for months or years, thus giving the U.S. all the time it needs to bring its full military strength to bear. Rather, Russia is far more likely to move swiftly to seize strategically important territory and then to make it extremely painful for the U.S. and NATO to roll back its gains. What matters in this scenario is Russia's short-term advantage over the U.S. in its own neighborhood, not America's superior global capabilities. By maintaining local, short-term superiority, Russia could force the Western powers to the negotiating table, and to demonstrate that U.S. security guarantees are not worth the paper on which they're written. To meet the Russian challenge, Colby and Solomon call for an integrated strategy that would require frontline states to invest in paramilitary capabilities that can deter Russian infiltrators. Yet they also call for stationing a modest number of U.S. and other allied troops in Poland and elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe, not only to demonstrate that the U.S. is committed to the defense of the region but also to make Russian military adventurism far more risky and costly for Moscow. Basing U.S. troops in the region wouldn't be prohibitively expensive, as U.S. allies would help defray the cost. But it would cost something. The question U.S. policymakers have to ask themselves is if they'd rather spend a modest amount of money to deter Russian aggression today or if they'd prefer to spend far more fighting a war in Eastern Europe tomorrow. The case of Russia helps illustrate why it is foolish to compare U.S. military spending to that of other countries. And Russia is hardly alone in modernizing its military in ways that threaten global security. China has been pursuing a similar strategy in East Asia, which poses similar challenges to the U.S. and its Pacific Rim allies. The U.S. military must be capable of overcoming threats not just in its own neighborhood, but in regions far from home. Yet there is another reason U.S. military expenditures are so high relative to America's potential rivals, which is at least as consequential: U.S. labor costs are much higher than labor costs in poorer countries like Russia, China, and Iran. As Dinah Walker of the Council on Foreign Relations has put it, ""$1 million in the United States will hire fewer soldiers than $1 million in Russia or China."" She points out that ""[i]f military budgets were compared in a way that reflected varying personnel costs, U.S. military preeminence would appear smaller than it does using straightforward comparisons based on market exchange rates."" One of the main reasons many Americans balk at spending more on the military is the sense that the Pentagon is obscenely wasteful. The trouble is that there is considerable disagreement over what counts as waste. Personnel costs are a good example of where the rubber meets the road. These costs represent roughly a quarter of all U.S. military spending, and compensation costs for active-duty service members and veterans have been growing at a rapid clip in recent years, due in large part to pension and health benefits. Robert O. Work, one of America's foremost defense intellectuals and the current Deputy Secretary of Defense, has estimated that even if the rate of increase in personnel costs slows down sharply in the years to come, personnel costs will reach 46 percent of the U.S. defense budget by 2021. The U.S. military has adapted to high labor costs in a number of ways. Jonathan Caverley, a political scientist at Northwestern, has observed that high labor costs are a big part of why the U.S. military gravitates towards more capital- and firepower-intensive military strategies over more labor-intensive strategies. We presume that the U.S. military is desperate to avoid casualties because of the political costs, but there are economic costs as well. The aversion to casualties also stems from the fact that the American armed forces rely on expensive and expensive-to-train military personnel. If there is a choice to be made between endangering the lives of U.S. military personnel and making profligate use of ammunition, gasoline, and high-tech weapons of all kinds to achieve its objectives, the Pentagon will always choose the latter. Poorer countries and nonstate actors don't have the option of pursuing firepower-intensive strategies, and so they are profligate with the lives of their soldiers and followers instead. Can the U.S. military reduce spending on personnel? Yes, it's possible. If Work is right about the future trajectory of personnel costs, the Pentagon won't really have much of a choice, even if the U.S. were to increase its defense budget substantially. But cutting personnel costs will be much harder than you might think. One approach would be to learn from the private sector and embrace offshoring. If high U.S. labor costs are limiting the number of active-duty service members the U.S. military can employ, perhaps the U.S. should emulate the United Arab Emirates and hire foreign mercenaries. Believe it or not, the U.S. has already gone down this route to some extent, as Sean McFate, author of The Modern Mercenary, recently explained to the New York Times. In Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. relied heavily on private military contractors to ease the burden on its own overstretched personnel. Suffice it to say, relying too heavily on mercenaries is far from ideal. It is easy to imagine that over time, the U.S. military will devote more of its time and energy to training foreign military personnel to do jobs that U.S. service members can't or won't do. Yet it is well-trained and well-paid U.S. service members who will have to take on these training duties in the first place. There are other, less colorful ways to trim personnel costs. The Obama administration has proposed modest reductions in pension and health benefits, but even these modest reductions have proven extremely controversial, for the straightforward reason that many Americans believe that we shouldn't skimp on benefits and pay for those who volunteer to defend their country. I happen to think that President Obama is right to call for pension and benefit reform for military personnel, and we might be able to reduce compensation costs somewhat further. In his new book The Future of Land Warfare, Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution notes that ""enlisted personnel of a given age and experience tend to make more than 90 percent of all civilian employees with comparable characteristics,"" and that if health and pension benefits were accounted for, ""the percentages would actually grow even higher."" The danger, however, is that if the military cuts compensation costs too much, it will have a harder time attracting and retaining the skilled women and men it needs most. Of course, personnel costs aren't the only fiscal challenge facing the U.S. military. In 20YY: Preparing for War in the Robotic Age, a 2014 report published by the Center for a New American Security, Work and Shawn Brimley explored the technological advances that are transforming the military landscape, and the technological investments the Pentagon will need to make to keep up. For years, the U.S. military enjoyed a near-monopoly over guided munitions, stealth technology, and drones. This near-monopoly has come to an end, which means that the U.S. needs more sophisticated combat platforms that can prevail over rival militaries that have learned to exploit the weaknesses of its legacy systems. To that end, the U.S. has developed a slew of advanced combat platforms, like the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter air combat systems and Flight III Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer, among others. The trouble is that, as Work and Brimley explain, the operations and maintenance costs of these more advanced combat platforms are in many cases higher than for their predecessors. Moreover, these platforms can't be operated around-the-clock, as Bryan Clark and Jesse Sloman explain in Deploying Beyond Their Means, an alarming new report from the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. Historically, the Navy would deploy its ships for 6 to 7 months over the course of a period that could range from two years to three years, depending on the ship in question. In recent years, the Navy has given its ships less downtime. This has meant less time for maintenance, which in turn has meant that these very valuable assets are deteriorating at a more rapid rate. The same goes for the service members who operate them: the crews that man U.S. naval vessels and aircraft need time to train and to rest if they are to maintain their effectiveness. Ultimately, Work and Brimley argue that the U.S. military will have to rely more heavily on unmanned and autonomous combat systems. The unmanned aerial vehicles that have become such an important part of the U.S. arsenal are paving the way for drones that will be capable of fighting on the ground and underwater. In theory, these systems can help the military achieve its objectives while reducing personnel costs. There are other ways emerging technologies might help contain military spending. Maintenance costs might fall as the military drives further advances in additive manufacturing, or 3-D printing, which could eventually allow U.S. forces to replace parts and upgrade combat systems while deployed, without having to ship these combat systems back home or relying on long-range logistics infrastructure. Equally promising are electric weapons, which are potentially much cheaper per shot than guided munitions, and which can help counter the threat posed by ballistic missiles. Other thinkers, like Jerry Hendrix, a retired Navy captain and senior fellow at CNAS, emphasize the importance of relying on cheap weapons systems that are more flexible and less vulnerable than the top-of-the-line systems that are so sacred to the military, like the Navy's prized carrier strike groups. Hendrix has called on the U.S. Navy to stop building new aircraft carriers, which can cost as much as $14 billion a piece, and to redirect the funds for one aircraft carrier to instead build ""seven missile-laden destroyers, or seven submarines, or 28 frigates, or 100 joint high-speed vessels, or any combination thereof."" Hendrix says his ""Fords, not Ferraris"" approach would increase America's ability to project power while containing costs. Will advances and reforms like this mean that the U.S. military doesn't need to spend more to do its job well? Not quite. If the Pentagon makes wise investments, the U.S. military could achieve its military objectives far more cost-effectively in the future. To get to this lower-cost future, however, the military will almost certainly have to spend more today. The reason is that the U.S. must maintain its core military capabilities in the present while also preparing for a future in which personnel costs will be far higher than they are today, and current systems will have outlived their usefulness. Some fear that the bureaucratic inertia all but guarantees that if the defense budget increases, the U.S. military will just pour money into wasteful legacy systems while failing to invest in the combat systems of tomorrow. But these fears needn't come to pass. What we need are policymakers who are willing to set priorities, make tough choices, and to push back when the military brass insists on buying Ferraris. What we have instead are policymakers who are imposing rigid, thoughtless, across-the-board defense cuts that are denying the military the resources it needs to do its job well today--and imperil its ability to protect America's interests in the future as well."

Needless to say, they have been disappointed with the legislative progress in the 114th Congress. Depending on how you look at it, Republican leaders are either a) mathematically unable to achieve a laundry list of the ideological goals they promised voters in 2014, or b) spineless clandestine liberal coward frauds. One of these has more merit than the other, but it angries up the blood a little bit less. Finally, there might be some good news for these GOP voters coming soon thanks to the seemingly boring appropriations process, set to be completed by Dec. 11. Congressional Republican leaders will tuck all sorts of goodies, via ""riders,"" into a trillion-dollar appropriations package required to keep the government funded through the remainder of the fiscal year. Some--OK, most--of these riders are intended to serve GOP elites' interests, specifically the many projected riders pertaining to financial, environmental, and campaign finance deregulation. Others, like those attempting to ""defund"" Planned Parenthood or to block the resettlement of Iraqi and Syrian refugees, will address the GOP base's favorite shiny objects du jour. The challenge for Republican leaders is the same straightforward story it always is: to ""secure enough concessions from Democrats to mollify the right wing while avoiding the political risks of shutdown brinkmanship,"" as Politico puts it. But the more interesting thread to follow as lawmakers return from holiday is how the White House and congressional Democratic minorities will pick their battles. Republicans quite consciously are throwing so many riders into the mix that Democrats will have to tacitly accept some while throwing their full weight into blocking others. Playing so much defense comes with opportunity costs: homing all of your caucus' energy into killing one measure glides the path for something equally or more noxious to skirt through undetected. Corporate lobbyists--who love omnibus spending packages--rely on such tactics. They fancy nothing more than an extended public pissing match over issues like grants for women's health care centers or whether all refugees are terrorists to redirect public energy away from the garbage they're trying to sneak through the legislative pipeline on behalf of their garbage clients. Consider one of the many battlefronts: The Waters of the United States rule, a measure that is going to expand the Environmental Protection Agency's jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. House and Senate Republicans intend to block the rule through a policy rider. This has been one of the most high-profile appropriations fights of the year, and some industry lobbyists believe they've just caught a major break: Everyone's talking about refugees now instead of them. The Intercept obtained a recording of a lobbyist strategy session organized by the Edison Electric Institute, a trade association representing utilities, in which participants discussed the fortuitous opportunity that a potential Syrian refugee funding battle presents them. ""We're suddenly not the big issue. ... I mean, this is all going to turn on refugees,"" one participant said. Another, more generally, believed that the refugee issue has put the White House ""on defense,"" which creates an atmosphere beneficial to their own situation. In the ""CRomnibus"" package that passed this time last year, most Democrats focused their ire on two riders: one to weaken certain rules regulating derivatives and another to loosen campaign finance limits for donations to political parties. These protests didn't get very far because they came after the appropriations honchos had negotiated a package that included a fair amount of give-and-take. What the focus on these two issues did do, however, was ""[obscured] how the CRomnibus boost[ed] special interests at the expense of ordinary people in a host of other ways,"" as the journalist David Dayen wrote for the Fiscal Times. Dayen listed more than a dozen other measures tucked into the package that were just as toxic to Democrats as the other two but received considerably less opprobrium. Meanwhile, the White House supported the bill because it got more money to fight ISIS and the Ebola outbreak. (Remember Ebola?) Sen. Barbara Mikulski, who negotiated on Democrats' behalf last year in her lame-duck days as chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, argued that ceding ground to the banks on one or two derivatives rules allowed her to secure more funding for financial regulators and block other items on the bank lobbyists' wish list. The funny thing about well-paid lobbyists representing the financial services sector, though, is that if you deny them certain riders in one funding bill, they just come back the next year and demand them again--along with new ones. They're still trying to strangle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau by limiting its independence. They're trying to block a proposed Labor Department rule that would protect clients against bad advice from conflicted financial advisers. And they're also trying to increase the level at which financial institutions count as ""systemically important."" Congressional elections may not seem like they've mattered much in recent years, as gridlock has prevented either party from going hog-wild with their most ambitious legislative desires. This appropriations deal--which will include much of the stuff that can't otherwise pass--will be the first where Republicans' unified control of Congress is truly felt, though. Democrats will have to lose many important fights in order to win a handful of possibly distracting others. The big question is: Will people even notice?"

But there were other options. Elements of Trump are present in the ""Know-Nothing"" movement of the 1840s, the radio demogogues of the 1930s, and the ""second"" Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s. There was also the F-word--fascism. At the time, this seemed like a category error. For as much as I saw (and still see) an authoritarian streak in Trump's rhetoric and demeanor, fascist seemed premature. Not the least because there's always been an authoritarian streak in American politics, from the Alien and Sedition Acts to Jim Crow. In the past week, however, ""Donald Trump as fascist"" has gone from hyperbolic to mainstream. After endorsing extreme measures in the aftermath of the Paris attacks--from registering Muslim Americans to closing mosques--assorted writers, observers, and political operatives began using fascist to describe Trump's approach. ""Forced federal registration of U.S. citizens, based on religious identity, is fascism. Period. Nothing else to call it,"" tweeted Jeb Bush adviser John Noonan. ""I just don't agree with that kind of thing,"" declared alleged presidential candidate Jim Gilmore. ""I've said it's fascist talk."" ""I'm still not sure it's 100 percent clear that Donald Trump really understands that he's a neo-fascist,"" wrote Michael Tomasky for the Daily Beast. As apparently mainstream as this is, however, there's still a question: What, specifically, makes Trump a fascist? After all, America has had racist politicians and internment policies for disparaged minorities. And while they were awful, they weren't necessarily fascist. Which is to say that, before changing our rhetoric, we should define our terms. Part of the problem of talking about fascism, at least in American political culture, is that there's nothing close to a common definition. Sometimes, it's used as a synonym for Hitler's Germany or Mussolini's Italy. Most often, it's a political insult, usually directed from the left to the right, but often in the reverse too, always in service of narrow partisan points. This is too bad because fascist and fascism are terms that actually mean something apart from contemporary political combat and the particulars of early- to mid-20th-century Europe. And while that meaning is fuzzy, contested, and contingent, there are elements that scholars can agree on. One of the most-read takes on fascism comes from Italian philosopher and novelist Umberto Eco in an essay for the New York Review of Books titled ""Ur-Fascism."" Eco emphasizes the extent to which fascism is ad hoc and opportunistic. It's ""philosophically out of joint,"" he writes, with features that ""cannot be organized into a system"" since ""many of them contradict each other, and are also typical of other kinds of despotism or fanacticism."" With that said, it is true that there are fascist movements, and it's also true that when you strip their cultural clothing--the German paganism in Nazism, for example--there are common properties. Not every fascist movement shows all of them, but--Eco writes--""it is enough that one of them be present to allow fascism to coagulate around it."" Eco identifies 14, but for this column, I want to focus on seven. They are: A cult of ""action for action's sake,"" where ""thinking is a form of emasculation""; an intolerance of ""analytical criticism,"" where disagreement is condemned; a profound ""fear of difference,"" where leaders appeal against ""intruders""; appeals to individual and social frustration and specifically a ""frustrated middle class"" suffering from ""feelings of political humiliation and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups""; a nationalist identity set against internal and external enemies (an ""obsession with a plot""); a feeling of humiliation by the ""ostentatious wealth and force of their enemies""; a ""popular elitism"" where ""every citizen belongs to the best people of the world"" and underscored by contempt for the weak; and a celebration of aggressive (and often violent) masculinity. Now, let's look at Trump. His campaign revolves around one theme: That the United States is weak, that it loses, and that it needs leadership to become ""great again."" ""We don't have victories anymore,"" he said in his announcement speech. ""When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. ... When do we beat Mexico at the border? They're laughing at us, at our stupidity."" He continued: ""The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems,"" and ""Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker."" This includes unauthorized immigrants, and now refugees, whom he attacks as a menace to ordinary Americans. The former, according to Trump, take jobs and threaten American safety--""They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.""--while the latter are a ""Trojan horse."" But Trump promises action. He will cut new deals and make foreign competitors subordinate. He will deport immigrants and build a wall on the border, financed by Mexico. He will bring ""spectacular"" economic growth. And Trump isn't an ideologue; he's an opportunist who borrows freely from both parties. How does he build favor with Republican voters? He shows bravado and ""strength,"" disparaging weak opponents. He indulges racist rhetoric and encourages violence against protesters. He speaks directly to the petite bourgeoisie in American life: managers, public employees, small-business owners. People squeezed on all ends and desperate for economic and cultural security against capitalist instability and rapid demographic shifts, as represented by President Obama. Elect him, Trump says, and he'll restore your security and American greatness. ""You're going to say to your children, and you're going to say to anybody else, that we were part of a movement to take back our country. ... And we will make America great again."" Alone and disconnected, this rhetoric isn't necessarily fascist. Some of it, in fact, is even anodyne. But together and in the person of Donald Trump, it's clear: The rhetoric of fascism is here. And increasingly, the policies are too. The only thing left is the violence. In the Europe of the 1920s and '30s, fascist parties organized armed gangs to intimidate political opponents. Despite assaults at Trump events, that still seems unlikely. But as we've seen with the rise of Trump, the wall between routine and unthinkable is much thinner than we'd like to think."	Why Fascist Is the Term That Best Describes Donald Trump
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/ted_cruz_sophisticated_muslim_bashing_how_the_texas_senator_peddles_bigotry.html	"Sen. Ted Cruz is going mainstream. As Slate's Jim Newell and Jamelle Bouie have reported, Cruz now sees a realistic path to the Republican presidential nomination and is repositioning himself, accordingly, as a statesmanlike alternative to Donald Trump. The tricky part is tapping into the same resentments Trump exploits--anti-immigrant, anti-Islam, anti-black--without doing it quite so crudely. There's a fine art to this sort of manipulation. You have to touch the right nerves--fear of a black president, indignation at bilingualism, hunger for retaliation against Muslims--while cloaking your demagoguery in the language of terrorism, sovereignty, and the rule of law. Cruz, a skilled lawyer and wordsmith, is demonstrating this technique in his current campaign against Muslim immigrants. Eight months ago, when Cruz announced his candidacy, he pledged to defeat ""radical Islamic terrorism."" This formulation allowed him to excoriate President Obama for refusing to acknowledge that our enemies were Muslim. At the same time, it insulated Cruz from charges of naked sectarianism. Cruz wasn't against all Muslims. He just wanted to protect us from radical, terrorist Muslims. Then came the attacks in Paris. An anti-Muslim backlash swelled on the right. Standing against terrorism wasn't good enough anymore. To stay on the cutting edge, Cruz needed a broader target. So he coined a new menace: ""Syrian Muslim refugees."" For more than a week, in nearly every speech and interview, Cruz has underscored this threat. To protect the United States, he argues, we must deny entry not to all refugees or to all Syrian refugees, but to Syrian Muslim refugees. In a tour of right-wing media, Cruz used this phrase twice on Sean Hannity's show, three times on Glenn Beck's show, three times on Graham Ledger's show, four times on Steven Crowder's show, and five times on Mark Levin's show. The new message serves three purposes. It conveys vigilance. It appeals to popular anger at Muslims. And it positions Cruz as a defender of Christians. Winning the religious right is a pillar of Cruz's campaign strategy. That's why, in one appearance after another, he has emphasized that his segregation of Muslim from non-Muslim immigrants is designed to protect Christians. As he explained to Beck:"	This Is How Ted Cruz Bashes Muslims While Pretending to Be Principled
8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/ted_cruz_is_distancing_himself_from_donald_trump.html	"While Donald Trump has been busy these last few days fabricating and retweeting racist lies in the latest phase of his white nationalist campaign, his fellow competitor, Sen. Ted Cruz, has initiated a subtler but more consequential pivot: He has started disagreeing with Trump, about literally anything. It was hard to tell for a while whether Cruz was running against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination or merely serving as the president of Trump's fan club. As former presidential candidate Gov. Bobby Jindal put it in September, ""Ted Cruz is clinging to Trump like a limpet to an oil tanker, hoping to suck up his votes when Trump eventually sinks."" Cruz shrewdly, and cynically, recognized early on that Trump had tapped into something visceral and real with a segment of Republican primary voters whose votes Cruz ultimately needs for himself. While the media and several other Republican candidates expressed horror at Trump's rhetoric toward undocumented immigrants over the summer, expecting his rhetoric to do him in by Labor Day, Cruz puckered up. ""Quite a few members of this field have attacked Donald Trump. A lot of folks in the media have asked me 'Ted Cruz, will you do the same?' "" Cruz said in early August. ""I have been glad to praise Donald Trump for speaking out boldly and brashly and for focusing on illegal immigration."" The two formally crystallized their relationship over a meeting, per Cruz's request, at Trump Tower. The strategy allowed Cruz to maintain a reservoir of good will among Trump's supporters, and it also kept Cruz out of Trump's trigger-happy Twitter-rant crosshairs. Cruz's suck-up shtick couldn't last forever. He wants to beat Trump, and that calls for an attitudinal shift at some point. But when? A major risk in the strategy of echoing Trump and then sopping up his voters when he collapses is that if Trump collapses, so will his echo. You have to push off at some point. That point appears to be now. While much of the right was complaining about the media's unfair accusation that Trump was ""calling"" for a federal database of Muslims, Cruz found it more in his interest to run with the media narrative rather than trash it. ""I'm a big fan of Donald Trump's, but I'm not a fan of government registries for American citizens,"" he said in Iowa on Friday. ""The First Amendment protects religious liberty, I've spent the past several decades defending religious liberty."" Over the weekend, Cruz gave a more extensive interview to the Associated Press in which he tried to position himself, in the AP's terms, as the ""electable conservative"" or the ""electable outsider."" In a statement that his adversaries in either the Republican or Democratic parties will find comical, Cruz--yes, the same Cruz who was praising Trump over the summer for his courage in labeling undocumented immigrants ""rapists""--argued that ""Tone matters. ... Are there some in the Republican Party whose rhetoric is unhelpful with regard to immigration? Yes."" When pressed about how he could possibly make this criticism in the same week that he was campaigning with his most recent high-profile endorser, Iowa Rep. Steve King, Cruz, that sly devil, said that he ""cannot help the language that others use. I can only help the words that come out of my own mouth."" King, not accidentally, was sitting in a separate vehicle as part of Cruz's entourage while Cruz was giving this interview. Why now? Well, aside from the fact that it's nearly December and it's time to make stuff happen, take a gander at the most recent Iowa poll from CBS News. Ben Carson, who apparently is subject to the same laws of political gravity from which Trump is exempt, has begun to fall while Trump has retaken the lead. Cruz is now in second place with a personal-best 21 percent. Cruz intends to win Iowa. And then South Carolina and the rest of the South, en route to a majority of delegates. It could happen, and for this Cruz owes the world to Trump. When Cruz first declared his candidacy, few--including myself--gave him much of a chance because he was too far outside the mainstream. He was a factional candidate. But when Trump and Carson entered, they blew wide open the allotted space for anti-establishment, outsider candidates. This has allowed Cruz, unbelievably enough, to position himself as a compromise candidate between Trump and alleged ""moderates"" like Sen. Marco Rubio. He'll pound Rubio for representing the elites on one side, while presenting himself as the more polished, credentialed figure to Trump supporters on the other. Like every other candidate, though, Cruz's strategy hinges on that same question everyone's been asking for nearly six months: Will Trump collapse? If he doesn't, then Cruz's cynical masterpiece of a presidential campaign will end up with all the rest: in the footnotes."	Why Ted Cruz Is Suddenly Distancing Himself From Donald Trump
9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/cnn_s_new_debate_format_is_a_vast_improvement.html	"The end of October and beginning of November marked the best days that Chris Christie's sluggish presidential campaign has had this year. A talk he gave about the need to empathize with addicts went viral and has been viewed, as of Friday, more than 8 million times. His McCain-like emphasis on holding town hall after town hall after town hall in New Hampshire, a format and a state for which he's a natural fit, had begun to bear some fruit. A WBUR poll of New Hampshire Republicans released at the beginning of November showed him drawing a solid 8 percent of the vote, above the 2 to 5 percent at which he'd been stuck for the previous couple of months. More importantly, his once-dreadful favorability numbers were rising, suggesting that he would have more room to grow down the stretch. But on Nov. 5, just as this kinda, sorta Christie-mentum was building, the Fox Business Network announced that the New Jersey governor would be relegated for the first time to the kids' table debate on Nov. 10, because he did not reach the requisite 2.5-percent threshold in national polls. This was the clearest example yet of the flaw in the model that networks had chosen to winnow the candidates into a manageable number. Christie had begun to do exactly what he needed to do--make gains in an early state, in the hope that an eventual victory there would propel him to victory elsewhere--but was being punished because his national polling remained poor. There is no national presidential primary day, so this was an utterly ridiculous turn of events. The problems here are manifold and they should be obvious. It's in candidates' electoral interest to (a) perform strongly in New Hampshire and/or Iowa and (b) rely on debates for the broader purpose of building awareness. But if you spend all of your time going on cable news and performing other slapstick stunts in order to secure enough national attention just to get into the debates, then that cuts into the necessary work of building up an organization in Iowa or New Hampshire. In short: National polls are fun but also stupid and useless, and tethering debate participation to them is equally stupid and useless. It took four debates for networks to finally understand the flaw in the model. CNN announced Friday that it would incorporate early state polling into its formula for inclusion in the Republican presidential debate being held in Las Vegas on Dec. 15. It took the network a second chance at a GOP debate, but CNN still deserves credit for being the first to figure out that this process was stupid and useless. The new system is also not some complex Bowl Championship Series-style supercomputer algorithm spitting out a random number that somehow represents a candidate's chances. Instead you need either a certain bare minimum in national polls or another bare minimum in New Hampshire or Iowa. ""Candidates,"" CNN wrote, ""must meet one of three criteria in polls conducted between October 29 and December 13 and recognized by CNN: An average of at least 3.5% nationally; at least 4% in Iowa; or at least 4% in New Hampshire."" Three separate criteria does not mean that everyone gets in. ""Right now,"" the network added, ""nine candidates would make cut for the [next debate]: Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, Carly Fiorina and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie."" Now there are no excuses not to be on that stage. If your campaign shows any sign of life, this tripartite qualification system should detect it. Christie is nowhere in useless national polls and isn't even contesting Iowa but is beginning to do well in New Hampshire. In! Lindsey Graham, Rick Santorum, George Pataki, and Mike Huckabee are stinking it up left, right, up, and down. Out! Comically enough, Bobby Jindal, who was at least registering a pulse in Iowa, would have been near the threshold for participation based on recent polls there. He could have been: in! But he already ended his campaign, so he is: out! In other excellent news, Wolf Blitzer, a personality whose chunk of airtime only seems to increase the more obvious it becomes that he has no business being on television, will moderate the debate. It's going to be sensational watching the candidates stomp all over him whenever he asks a question they don't like or even a question they do like. CNN is just making all the right choices. Bravo!"	CNN's New Debate Format Is Really Good for the GOP
10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/president_obama_is_losing_the_argument_about_syrian_refugees.html	"The Obama administration's ability to defeat Republican legislative proposals to cut off the resettling of additional Syrian refugees hinges on maintaining unity among Democrats, who might be politically tempted after the Paris attacks to side with the GOP's restrictionist rhetoric. So far, it's not going very well. Forty-seven House Democrats sided with 242 Republicans to pass the American Security Against Foreign Enemies (SAFE) Act on Thursday. That's a veto-proof majority among the 426 members who voted today. One can see why: It's a clever piece of legislation. Though it doesn't explicitly ban resettling additional Syrian refugees or institute Sen. Ted Cruz's ""Christians only"" policy, it does make the task of resettling said refugees bureaucratically arduous. The legislation requires the FBI director, the secretary of Homeland Security, and the director of National Intelligence to certify that each Syrian (or Iraqi) refugee doesn't present a security risk. And then the DHS inspector general has to go through all of the approvals, too. The effect would be to slow the acceptance of refugees to a crawl, putting in place the freeze Republicans wanted under the inconspicuous message of ""just another layer of vetting."" That's enough cover for anxious Democrats to support it--or rather, enough pressure that they can't vote against it. You could see this coming. The Democratic governor of New Hampshire, Maggie Hassan, who's running for Senate against incumbent Sen. Kelly Ayotte, joined most Republican governors earlier this week in seeking to keep Syrian refugees from being resettled in her state for the time being. Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democrats' leader-in-waiting, also said earlier this week that a ""pause"" in accepting refugees ""may be necessary,"" a stance at odds with that of the current Democratic leader. (Schumer has since tried to walk his comments back.) In a classic case of senators being hilarious prima donnas, they reportedly were quite miffed Wednesday when the White House sent over the deputy FBI director to brief them in a closed-door session instead of the director. Many House Democrats, meanwhile, found White House chief of staff Denis McDonough's pitch unconvincing in a meeting Thursday morning. (House Democrats, in general, don't appreciate that the only time they hear from the administration is when the administration really wants something from them.) Democrats facing close races are reluctant to stand with the White House on this one. A Bloomberg poll released yesterday showed that 53 percent of Americans don't believe any Syrian refugees should be accepted, while only 28 percent support the administration's plan to resettle 10,000 Syrian refugees. Republicans are very much against accepting refugees. Forty-six percent of Democrats support the administration's position, but 36 percent don't believe any refugees should be resettled and 9 percent believe only Christians should. Unless Democrats are running in safe districts or states, they will not want to make themselves vulnerable to the inevitable ""[Such and such Democrat] voted to let INSANE TERRORISTS into AMERICA to BOMB EVERYONE"" ads in the coming elections. The SAFE Act will now go to the Senate where, if called up, it may surpass 60 votes--Reid is denying that it will--though hitting a veto-proof 67 would be a tougher task. What seems certain, though, is that the White House's pitch for everyone to just calm down about refugees and visitors from countries with terrorist organizations is not working. Senate Democrats may reject the House bill, but they're already pivoting to alternatives because they recognize that they need to do something to alleviate fears. The legislation introduced by Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Jeff Flake, would block European citizens ""who spent time in Syria or Iraq in the past five years"" from obtaining visa waivers. Most likely there was nothing the White House could have done to stop this post-Paris freak out. But as refreshing as they may have been, President Obama's first comments on the refugee situation perhaps shouldn't have been to mock the no more refugees! position. He could have done that later on, after offering an explanation for how thorough the vetting process for refugees already is. He argues that knee-jerk reactions like barring all refugees fleeing a war zone don't represent ""who we are"" as a nation. Apparently they do."	Obama Is Losing the Argument About Syrian Refugees

Once Bush left office, an angry conservative elite, led by Newt Gingrich, Sarah Palin, and Rudy Giuliani, campaigned against the idea of allowing a mosque near Ground Zero. Now, after last week's attack on Paris, Republicans are converging around a form of prejudice that's easier to exploit and defend: Muslim refugees, unlike Christians, should be presumed guilty. Old-style Islamophobia hasn't died out. It bursts from the mouths of some conservative voters and has gone uncorrected by this year's Republican presidential candidates. Two candidates, Ben Carson and Sen. Rick Santorum, have declared that no devout Muslim should be elected president. On Monday, Donald Trump's spokeswoman tweeted, ""Islam preys on the weak and uses political correctness as cover."" Initially, many of the candidates described the enemy as ""radical Islamic terrorism."" But since the Paris attacks, they've shed the qualifiers. Jeb Bush now calls it simply ""Islamic terrorism,"" and he chides President Obama for refusing to use that term. Carly Fiorina has adopted the same shorthand. Mike Huckabee has dumped the terrorism part altogether. The president's job, says Huckabee, is ""protecting Americans, not the image of Islam."" Sen. Marco Rubio draws an analogy to Nazism. A few days ago, on ABC's This Week, he was shown a clip of Hillary Clinton saying, ""I don't think we we're at war with all Muslims. I think we're at war with jihadists."" George Stephanopoulos pointed out to Rubio that Clinton had avoided the words ""radical Islam."" Rubio ridiculed her aversion: ""That would be like saying we weren't at war with the Nazis, because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi Party but weren't violent themselves."" In Rubio's analysis, violence is no longer a crucial distinction. Instead, Islamic radicalism is a single entity akin to the German Nazi Party. Sen. Ted Cruz takes the next step. On Tuesday, he was asked whether his argument against Muslim refugees from Syria--that some of them might be dangerous--could have been used to block his own father's emigration to the United States from Cuba. Cruz replied: ""If my father were part of a theocratic and political movement like radical Islamism that promotes murdering anyone who doesn't share your extreme faith or forcibly converting them, then it would make perfect sense."" But Cruz doesn't just advocate the exclusion of radical Islamists. He advocates the exclusion of all Syrian Muslims. Some might be killers, therefore all must be excluded. As governors and presidential candidates compete to appease public anxiety, distinctions among Muslims--who's violent, who's radical, who's theocratic, who's affiliated with terrorists or terrorist sympathizers--are tossed aside. On Tuesday, in an interview on MSNBC, Huckabee said ""It's not about Muslims""--and then explained why, in effect, it is. ""If Methodists were strapping bombs to their children's chests and blowing them up so to kill a bunch of civilians, I'd be saying we need to be real careful about letting Methodists in, too,"" he argued. ""I don't know of any other group of people uniquely that are targeting innocent civilians and committing these acts of mayhem."" Some Republican candidates are willing to distinguish among the refugees. But the distinction they draw isn't among Muslims; it's between Muslims and Christians. ""There aren't any Christian terrorists in the Middle East,"" says Jeb Bush. Cruz says almost the same thing: ""There is no meaningful risk of Christians committing acts of terror."" On this basis, and because Christians are often a persecuted minority, Bush says the United States should focus on helping Christian refugees. Cruz says we should bar the entry of ""Syrian Muslim refugees"" but should accept Christians. Rather than welcome Muslims, Cruz says we should put them where they belong: ""majority Muslim countries."" Beyond that, the candidates aren't interested in distinctions. If you're Muslim, there's no point in investigating any further. Are you Sunni or Shiite? Are you radical or moderate? Are you affiliated with a militant organization? Have you committed a crime? It's no use asking these questions, because, as Rubio explains, ""There's no way to background-check someone that's coming from Syria."" We won't even draw obvious distinctions, such as age or sex. On Monday, Gov. Chris Christie refused to accept orphaned Syrian toddlers. The only question we're willing to entertain, in the absence of reliable records, is whether, as Bush asserts, ""you can prove you're a Christian."" Tuesday night, in an interview with Sean Hannity, Trump said he'd been ""told by very, very good sources"" that among Syrians, ""if you're a Christian, you can't get into the United States,"" but it's easy ""if you're a Muslim."" Hannity showed viewers a series of statistics that, as he described it, revealed ""the numbers of the people we are taking in from Muslim countries."" Hannity asked Trump: ""Is there a clash of cultures, if you grow up in a country under Sharia law? ... How should we factor that in when we're taking in people from these countries? How do you ascertain whether they buy into the culture they came from or want to assimilate here?"" Among refugees, having a clean record isn't enough. If you grew up in a Muslim country, you've been brainwashed. ""I don't know that they even want to assimilate,"" Trump told Hannity. That's the new conservative standard: guilty until proven Christian. Arab, Muslim, terrorist--we don't have the luxury of sorting these people out. Just bar them all: the Syrians, the Muslims, the people from Muslim countries. Better yet, deport them. ""If I win, they're going out,"" Trump concluded. ""We can't take a chance."""	The New Republican Standard: Guilty Until Proven Christian

Asked about this on Monday during remarks at the G-20 summit, President Obama didn't hold back. ""When I hear folks say that: 'Well, maybe we should just admit the Christians but not the Muslims,' when I hear political leaders suggesting that there would be a religious test for which person who's fleeing from a war-torn country is admitted, when some of those folks themselves come from families who benefited from protection when they were fleeing political persecution, that's shameful,"" Obama said. ""That's not American. That's not who we are. We don't have religious tests to our compassion."" ""It is very important for us right now, particularly those who are in leadership, particularly those who have a platform and can be heard, not to fall into that trap, not to feed that dark impulse inside of us,"" Obama continued. ""I had a lot of disagreements with George W. Bush on policy, but I was very proud after 9/11 when he was adamant and clear about the fact that this is not a war on Islam. The notion that some of those who have taken on leadership in his party would ignore all of that, that's not who we are."" On Tuesday, things got worse. Despite the fact that all of the known Paris attackers were European nationals and not recent immigrants, more than half of American governors have lined up to say that they would not accept any Syrian refugees in their states. The fact that these governors actually lack the power to prevent refugees from coming is beside the point. Seated now in the deeply paranoid, conspiratorial anti-Muslim discourse that has infected the American national security debate, the Syrian refugee question has become just another front in the culture war. Considered in light of Obama's trenchant comments, it can also be seen as yet another round over the meaning of ""American exceptionalism,"" an argument that has been at a high pitch throughout, and in some ways defined, his presidency. From the earliest days of Obama's candidacy, his critics have tried to cast him as someone who didn't quite get what was great about America. They went after him for an ""apology tour,"" in which he publicly acknowledged that, in the past, the United States had done some things wrong. For his supporters, however, acknowledging that America had failed to live up to its ideals and should endeavor to do better is an essential component of leadership. Put simply, for conservatives, American exceptionalism is about American power. For liberals, it's about American responsibility. This difference couldn't be clearer than in the current argument over Syrian refugees. The refugee experience hits close to home for me. As for so many Americans, it's central to my understanding of American-ness in a very personal way. My father was born in a refugee camp in Germany, the son of Ukrainian refugees who had fled famine, war, and Soviet oppression. When I was 10 years old, my dad moved from journalism into humanitarian relief and development work, and he moved our family to the Philippines, where my he and my mom worked for a year in a refugee camp for Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Laotian refugees, fleeing war and oppression just as his own family did, as they prepared to come to the United States. (At the time, as Jamelle Bouie notes, many Americans were opposed to these ""boat people"" resettling here.) What motivated an American family to pack up the kids and move to the shores of the South China Sea? First, the fact that our family very directly owed a great deal to the generosity and sacrifice of others; second, our Christian faith, which exhorts us not only to be compassionate, but to act upon that compassion; and third, a deep commitment to the ideal of America as a refuge, and an understanding of the responsibility to preserve and strengthen that ideal. No one is saying that refugees, from anywhere, should simply be allowed into the country without being screened. It's just smart policy to vet refugees, and of course, this is what's being done now, despite what Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Mike Huckabee would have you believe. As Huffington Post's Elise Foley reported, the screening process is extensive and includes ""an 18- to 24-month process on average that includes biometric and biographic tests, interviews and other vetting procedures by a number of U.S. security agencies."" While acknowledging that security is a legitimate concern, it's also important to note that, of the hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East who have come to the United States since Sept. 11, 2001, not one has committed any act of terror. These facts should not be lost as our more opportunistic politicians claw their way to the paranoid, populist bottom. As with so much else in our national security debates in recent years--torture, civil rights, detention, war, and occupation--these arguments are not just about policy, but about who we are as a country, about the society we're trying to preserve, a place people from all over the world see as a refuge.

14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/syrian_refugee_crisis_an_alternative_to_resettling_refugees_in_europe.html	"In the wake of the Paris attacks, a number of people, in France and elsewhere, are rethinking their stance on the resettlement of Syrian refugees. But the truth is that the attacks should change nothing. The large-scale resettlement of Syrian refugees in Europe was a bad idea before the Paris attacks, and it is a bad idea now. First, let's acknowledge that while there may well be a handful of ISIS infiltrators among the Syrian refugees seeking asylum in Europe, the vast majority of them are fleeing Islamist violence, and they have no intention of waging wars on their hosts and benefactors. To suggest otherwise is nonsense. The Islamic State has made no secret of its contempt for those Syrians and Iraqis who've fled its rule, and the Paris attacks haven't changed that. The reason large-scale resettlement in Europe is a mistake is not that Syrian refugees are dangerous. Rather, it is a mistake because large-scale resettlement will require an equally large-scale commitment of resources that European governments, and European voters, are unwilling to make. This is not to suggest that there are no circumstances under which Syrian refugees might at some point represent a security threat. Recently, one of the most articulate defenders of refugee resettlement, Daniel Byman, a professor of security studies at Georgetown and a regular contributor at Slate, warned that ""the true terrorism danger is that the refugees are not cared for or are welcomed briefly in a fit of sympathy and then scorned and repressed."" He's right. The trouble is that Syrian refugees are not a monolithic bloc, and even the most generous resettlement policy might feel repressive to, say, Syrians who believe that the doctrines of gender equality and sexual liberalism represent an affront to their religion. Policymakers don't have the power to decide how their actions will be interpreted. Nor do they have the power to dictate how ordinary Europeans will react to Syrians on a human level. In much of northern Europe, it is common to hear European Muslims complain of the emotional coldness of their native-born non-Muslim neighbors, who never stop treating them as foreigners, no matter how hard they try to fit in. This subjective sense of exclusion does much to fuel resentment on the part of European Muslims, and understandably so. It's not clear what policymakers can do about these failures of integration at the intimate level. Elsewhere, Byman has elaborated on the policy dimension of integrating Syrian refugees, observing that Europe already has a large population of radicalized Muslims, and that there is a real risk that these radicalized Muslims ""will transform the Syrian refugee community into a more violent one over time."" To guard against this outcome, Byman makes a convincing case that European governments must offer refugees ""a comprehensive and long-term package that includes political rights, educational support, and economic assistance as well as immediate humanitarian aid, particularly if they are admitted in large numbers."" What Byman doesn't really address is whether European voters will welcome this prospect, particularly in countries where the social safety net is already under intense strain. Sweden is making across-the-board spending cuts to meet the cost of providing for the roughly 190,000 refugees from Syria, Iraq, and other countries who've arrived in recent months, and other European countries are likely to follow. How many European voters are willing to pay substantially higher taxes for the privilege of doing more for new arrivals from Syria and Iraq? How many will be willing in the wake of the Paris attacks? To be sure, Syrian refugees won't just be consumers of public services. Eventually, at least some of them will enter the workforce. It is worth noting, however, that youth unemployment rates across Europe are frighteningly high, and workers with low levels of literacy and numeracy face particularly grim economic prospects. One can easily imagine that many Syrian refugees and their descendants will become part of a permanent economic underclass, much like an earlier wave of Muslim migrants who fled political turmoil in Algeria. There are certainly Europeans who believe that it is the duty of affluent countries to absorb brutalized refugee populations, particularly among the more educated and better-off. Resettled refugees, however, tend to reside in lower-income neighborhoods, where employment opportunities are relatively limited, and where their neighbors are Europeans, including European Muslims, who may well see them as competitors for access to scarce social goods. Given the manifest failure of France, Belgium, and Germany to successfully integrate native-born Muslims into the cultural and economic mainstream of their societies, despite decades of fitful efforts to that end, what reason do we have to believe that these governments will succeed in 2015? Byman writes that if Syrian refugees are not successfully integrated into local communities, ""they risk perpetuating, or even exacerbating, the tensions between Muslim and non-Muslim communities in Europe."" He's right on this score, too. There is an alternative to large-scale refugee resettlement in Europe, though it poses many practical challenges of its own. In ""Help Refugees Help Themselves,"" an essay in the latest issue of Foreign Affairs, Alexander Betts and Paul Collier offer a plan that would resettle Syrian refugees closer to home. While hundreds of thousands of Syrians have sought refuge in Europe, millions have instead made their way to Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey. Some have found themselves in refugee camps; others have settled in cities, where they work illegally and lead a marginal existence. Betts and Collier offer a more sustainable solution: Instead of herding refugees into camps where they are forced to subsist on aid, they call for the creation of special economic zones. Essentially, a consortium of countries, including all of the major Western economies, would create financial incentives and trade concessions to spur industrial development in these zones, which would employ refugees and, in some number, citizens of the host country. Betts and Collier note that the Jordanian government has already established a number of industrial zones, one of which, King Hussein Bin Talal Development Area in the eastern Mafraq Governorate, is just 10 miles away from the sprawling Zaatari refugee camp. With its current infrastructure, KHBTDA can accommodate as many as 100,000 workers, but it currently employs only 10,000. If KHBTDA were reinvented as a special economic zone for Syrian refugees, Betts and Collier report that it could employ every worker in the Zaatari camp and only reach half of its full capacity. With the help of the international community, KHBTDA could become a hub for labor-intensive manufacturing and other kinds of productive economic activity. Ultimately, skills learned and firms established in these new special economic zones could be brought back to Syria once peace is re-established there. The beauty of Betts and Collier's approach is that it provides Syrians with a measure of economic self-sufficiency and cultural autonomy in exile, and it sidesteps the challenges of integration by giving them their own space in which to flourish. Getting the Jordanians to agree to such a scheme may well be challenging. And making such industrial zones viable would require major investments not just from the host countries but from the European Union, the U.S., and rich democracies around the world, who would need to use aid dollars to convince the Jordanians to go along. Yet the costs of getting it off the ground would be a small fraction of the costs of successfully integrating refugee families into European societies that are at best ambivalent about welcoming them into their societies and economies.

15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/prayer_shaming_isn_t_about_attacking_prayer_it_s_about_calling_out_empty.html	"Wednesday afternoon, two shooters turned San Bernardino, California, into the site of the deadliest mass shooting in the U.S. since the 2012 attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School. Even considering the unusual early details--the husband-and-wife attackers, their escape from the scene--there was a grim familiarity to the way Wednesday's events unfolded. The aerial maps, the police press conference, the worried relatives cleaving one by one into groups of the relieved and the grieving--Americans know these scripts by now. One element of the post-massacre liturgy is getting fresh attention, however: the politicians who quickly offered their public ""thoughts and prayers"" to the victims. President Obama pushed back against ""thoughts and prayers"" in a press conference after the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon in October. ""Our thoughts and prayers are not enough,"" Obama said back then. Two months and 57 mass shootings later, the apparent backlash against prayer has metastasized. ""GOD ISN'T FIXING THIS"" blared the New York Daily News's remarkable front page Thursday morning. The Daily News editors illustrated their point with tweets from GOP leaders who had quickly turned out near-identical statements. Indeed, several presidential candidates seemed to speak in unison: ""Our prayers are with the victims ..."" (Ted Cruz), ""My thoughts and prayers are with the shooting victims ..."" (Ben Carson), ""My thoughts and prayers are with the victims ..."" (Rand Paul), and so on. An editor at Think Progress retweeted a long series of ""thinking and praying"" politicians and appended information about their recent campaign donations from the NRA. The Washington editor of the Nation contrasted Republicans' ""thoughts and prayers"" with the Democratic candidates' calls to action: Both politicians and plebes have been offering ""thoughts and prayers"" in response to tragedy for ages. It's a stock phrase in both sympathy cards and verified tweets. So what's going on with this new resentment? Emma Green, writing in the Atlantic, dubbed it ""prayer shaming"":"	"""Prayer-Shaming"" Isn't About Attacking Prayer. It's About Calling Out Empty Platitudes. "
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/ted_cruz_s_hypocrisy_on_the_planned_parenthood_attacks.html	"The 2016 Republican presidential candidates claim to oppose terrorism. They say they're motivated not by pro-Christian or anti-Muslim bias, but by a consistent ethic of calling out and confronting religious violence. But their reactions to two recent incidents belie that claim. The first incident was the July 16 attack on military recruiters in Chattanooga, Tennessee, allegedly by a Muslim. The second is the Nov. 27 attack on a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Colorado, allegedly by a Christian. In each case, little was known at the time of the shooting. Yet the candidates treated the two cases quite differently. In fact, after the Colorado Springs attack, several candidates completely reversed the positions they had espoused after Chattanooga. Radical Christianity, unlike radical Islam, was given a pass. The day after the Chattanooga attack we knew a few things about the alleged gunman, Mohammod Youssuf Abdulazeez. According to the New York Times, he was a naturalized U.S. citizen. He had been ""born in Kuwait to Muslim Jordanian parents of Palestinian descent."" He had written online that Muslims should ""submit to Allah."" He had never been on any list of terrorism suspects. And he was due to appear in court on a three-month-old drunk-driving charge. The Times reported that Abdulazeez had ""made several trips to Jordan,"" but the paper also cautioned that investigators hadn't yet determined whether he was connected to or motivated by a terrorist organization. Despite the limits of this information, the absence of official statements, and the availability of a non-religious explanation for the attack, Sen. Ted Cruz delivered his verdict. Abdulazeez ""was there to carry out jihad, an act of radical Islamic terrorism,"" Cruz declared in a statement on the day after the attack. Cruz ridiculed the ""delusion"" that ""a 'lone gunman'--as President Obama described the shooter--is somehow isolated from the larger threat of radical Islamic terrorism. In the modern world, no one acts in isolation."" The Nov. 27 incident in Colorado Springs presented Cruz with similar circumstances. Again, in lieu of an official statement of motive, there were only suggestive media reports. By 2:30 p.m. on Nov. 28, NBC News had reported that under interrogation the alleged gunman, Robert Lewis Dear, had used the phrase ""no more baby parts."" By 6 p.m., the Times had reported more. Dear had given his neighbor anti-Obama pamphlets. He had painted or posted crosses on at least two of his homes. In 2005, a message board user who appeared to be Dear had written: ""AIDS, hurricanes, we are in the end times. Accept the LORD JESUS while you can."" Dear's ex-wife told the paper that although he wasn't a regular churchgoer, ""He believed wholeheartedly in the Bible. That's what he always said; he read it cover to cover to cover."" By the evening of Nov. 28, these reports had been widely disseminated. Nevertheless, the following afternoon, Cruz cautioned that people shouldn't  ""jump to conclusions."" ""There has been some vicious rhetoric on the left blaming those who are pro-life,"" Cruz protested. ""We don't fully know the motivations of this deranged individual. ... The media promptly wants to blame him on the pro-life movement, when at this point there's very little evidence to indicate that."" A reporter asked Cruz about Dear's alleged ""baby parts"" comment. Cruz shot back, ""It's also reported that he was registered as an independent and as a woman. And a transgendered leftist activist, if that's what he is, I don't think it's fair to blame on the rhetoric on the left."" Another reporter asked Cruz whether the incident was ""domestic terrorism."" Cruz demurred: ""I would call it a murder. And we'll see what the facts are. It was a multiple murder [by] what appears to be a deranged individual."" In every respect, Cruz's response to Colorado Springs was a complete reversal of his response to Chattanooga. In the Tennessee case, Cruz ridiculed lone-gunman explanations--""no one acts in isolation""--and demanded that the incident be understood in the context of ""previous episodes"" and the ""larger threat"" of radical Islamic violence. Cruz blamed not just the shooter but the messages that might have provoked him. And Cruz placed ultimate responsibility on an underlying ideology: ""radical Islam."" In the Colorado case, Cruz did the opposite. He said there was too little evidence of motive. He blamed ""a deranged individual."" He refused to call the incident terrorism. He rejected any attempt to blame the attack on incitement or on radical Christian ideology. Instead, based on speculation in the right-wing blogosphere, Cruz reached for a preposterous, bogus counter-narrative about a transgender person attacking an abortion clinic. A week before the Colorado attack, Cruz had lavishly praised a pro-life activist who once wrote that we are ""commanded by God"" to execute abortionists. If any Muslim had praised an imam who issued such edicts, Cruz would have denounced him. Then, on Nov. 30, three days after the attack, Cruz and conservative talk-show host Hugh Hewitt insisted that no pro-lifer had ever advocated violence. Cruz also excoriated the media for doing to Christians and Republicans what Cruz had done four months earlier to Muslims: ""Every time you have some sort of violent crime or mass killing, you can almost see the media salivating, hoping, hoping desperately that the murderer happens to be a Republican so they can use it to try to paint their political enemies."" Cruz isn't the only candidate who has changed his tune. On July 17, the day after the Chattanooga shooting, Sen. Marco Rubio focused on radical Islamic messages that might have provoked the gunman. ""There are people living inside the United States, some whom have never even left this country, who are being radicalized online,"" Rubio warned during a campaign stop in Iowa. He asserted that the shooter had been ""radicalized to take a gun and kill four Marines."" Rubio argued that the government must not just catch these killers but ""find out if they're working for someone else as part of a broader conspiracy."" But on Nov. 30, three days after the Colorado Springs shooting, Rubio focused on the gunman, not on whatever message might have radicalized him. An interviewer in New Hampshire asked Rubio how he would handle ""domestic terrorism, particularly in light of the Planned Parenthood shooting in Colorado."" Rubio rejected that analysis. He classified the shooting with other crimes committed by ""a sick person who takes it upon themselves to do something horrifying like this."" He used his answer to talk not about terrorism but about ""how we address mental health."" Other candidates have also switched positions. On the day of the Chattanooga shooting, Donald Trump said President Obama should stop being ""politically correct"" and should call out the menace for what it was: ""Islamic terrorism."" But two days after the Colorado Springs shooting, when Trump was asked whether ""the heated rhetoric"" around Planned Parenthood had contributed to the killer's eruption, Trump replied: ""No. I think he's a sick person. And I think he was probably a person ready to go. We don't even know the purpose."" Hours after the Chattanooga incident, Mike Huckabee said that the attack was ""not isolated"" and that other Americans were being similarly radicalized. He accused Obama of refusing ""to identify the real enemy"" in order ""to protect the image of Islam."" But two days after the Colorado incident, Huckabee declared, ""I don't know of anybody who has suggested violence toward Planned Parenthood personnel."" Ignoring several past cases, Huckabee dismissed the notion that anti-abortion activists would send ""some madman into a clinic to kill people."" In the days since the candidates' initial responses to the Colorado attack, we've learned more about Dear. On Nov. 30, the Charleston Post and Courier quoted a 1993 divorce filing from Dear's then-wife: ""He claims to be a Christian and is extremely evangelistic, but does not follow the Bible in his actions. He says that as long as he believes he will be saved, he can do whatever he pleases. He is obsessed with the world coming to an end."" On Dec. 1, based on further interviews, the Times reported that ""a number of people who knew Mr. Dear said he was a staunch abortion opponent.""

Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, the shadow front-runners for the Republican nomination, have spent the last several weeks previewing the barbs they'll use against each other should they eventually assume the top two polling positions, as expected. Cruz says Rubio's soft on immigration. Rubio says Cruz is soft on surveillance. They disagree on the best approach to slashing taxes for the wealthy. On Monday, Cruz sharpened a new line against Rubio: that the Florida senator is a reckless nation-builder and an advocate of ""military adventurism,"" right up there with the treacherous Hillary Clinton. It's less of a pivot from Cruz than an elevation of the foreign policy subtext he's been prepping all along. And it's a twofer, because he could conceivably use it against Rubio in the primary and then against Clinton in a hypothetical general election faceoff. For the purpose of winning this election, Cruz has crafted himself as the middleman between Sen. Rand Paul's least interventionist foreign policy--which is unacceptable in a Republican primary--and the neoconservatives' omnidirectional interventionism--which is politically dangerous in a general election. Whatever brew of conviction and political opportunity brought Cruz here, it has the potential to serve as a breakthrough for the Republican Party. The GOP has wasted years on a misguided quest to find out what Clinton was eating or drinking at 2 a.m. the night of the Benghazi attack, which came more than a year after the Clinton-backed Libya intervention itself. Now Cruz, a top candidate trusted by conservatives, can lead the party onto the more solid-footed critique of Clinton's role in the 2011 Libya intervention, which has yet to produce much beyond Moammar Gadhafi's death and chaos in that country. This should have been the approach of the party the whole time, rather than obsessively going down one conspiracy theory rabbit hole after another on Benghazi. It's now the tack Cruz will take against his likely principal GOP primary rival. ""Senator Rubio emphatically supported Hillary Clinton in toppling Qaddafi in Libya,"" Cruz said in an interview with Bloomberg Politics on Monday. ""I think that made no sense."" Unlike some others who have opposed the Libya intervention but hedged on alternatives, Cruz forthrightly said that the United States had an interest in keeping Qaddafi in power. ""Qaddafi was a bad man, he had a horrible human rights record,"" he said. ""And yet ... he had become a significant ally in fighting radical Islamic terrorism."" Cruz went on to make the more obvious, big-picture analysis of the Benghazi attack--""The terrorist attack that occurred in Benghazi was a direct result of that massive foreign policy blunder""--before more creatively lumping President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and neoconservatives into one hot bundle of awful foreign policy decision-making:"	Ted Cruz's Latest Attack Line Hits Rubio and Clinton.

18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/why_gop_diversity_won_t_matter_to_minority_voters.html	"For the first time in its modern history, the Republican Party has a diverse candidate field for president. In fact, this year, it has the most diverse candidate field: Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are Cuban American, Ben Carson is black, and Carly Fiorina is a woman. And as the Washington Post notes, this is an opportunity and a challenge. ""Republicans face a tantalizing and vexing prospect this year,"" writes Marc Fisher. ""They have a unique opportunity to reach out to minorities as the party has long wanted to."" The goal is that black and Latino candidates might be able to augment party outreach efforts like the Libre Initiative and Committed to Community (organizations focused on Latino and Spanish-speaking communities and black communities, respectively). Again, here's Fisher: ""Some Republican leaders believe the way to soften the Democrats' hold on minorities is to field more black and Hispanic candidates and stay true to the party's ideals."" But there's a problem. Representation is great, but policies are better. And there, the Republican Party is lacking. Speaking to the Post, former Oklahoma Rep. J.C. Watts, who was one of two black Republicans in Congress when he entered the House of Representatives in 1995, hit this on the head: ""We're still not talking about the concerns of that young black couple starting a business or that young Hispanic family... Where are our solutions to deal with incarceration reform, unemployment, the trouble blacks and Hispanics have getting home mortgages?"" Yes, individual Republican lawmakers have backed reform on mass incarceration, immigration, and other issues that hold a special resonance for minority communities. But as a party, the GOP and its voters are on the other side of every issue most important to minority voters, from concerns over police violence to immigration reform and help for unauthorized immigrants. The idea that voters would ignore this--and vote instead on descriptive representation--is belied by the actual record of black and Latino Republicans in statewide elections. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott won just 10 percent of black voters in his 2014 re-election race, while Ted Cruz lost Latinos almost 2-to-1 in his 2012 bid against Paul Sadler. Indeed, a recent study from University of Cincinatti political scientist David Niven suggests that--among blacks at least--any electoral boost from racial identification is lost if the candidate is a Republican. ""There are some very successful African-American Republicans, but those folks don't attract African-American votes,"" he said. ""Party matters so much more than race."" Other data shows something similar for Latinos. With that said, there's anecdotal evidence that--even in a fight between Democrats--skin color is less important to winning voters than substantive representation. Rep. Steve Cohen is a Jewish congressman who represents a mostly-black district in Tennesee. In 2006, he won a three-way race against the Republican candidate and an independent--Jake Ford, brother of Harold Ford--despite losing key endorsements from influential black pastors. He's faced a black opponent in each subsequent primary election, and succeeded each time. Some of this is just incumbent advantage, but we also can't ignore the degree to which Cohen has built a durable bond with the district's voters. Put simply, there are clear and obvious limits to the political value of descriptive representation. And even when representation has mattered--Barack Obama's 2008 campaign, for instance--the impact is overstated. Conventional wisdom is that Obama drove enthusiasm and turnout among black voters, giving him his huge margins with blacks in the 2008 and 2012 elections. But that's only partially true. For starters, the rise in turnout in presidential elections preceded Obama; the black turnout jump from 2000 to 2004 is similar to the jump from 2004 to 2008. Obama accelerated turnout growth, but he didn't cause it. Even then, we can attribute a large portion of 2008's black turnout to community organization and outreach, not Obama's blackness. ""Campaign attentiveness, group identity, and efficacy measures did not reach especially high levels among African Americans in 2008, and their influence on turnout was less significant than other factors,"" wrote researchers in a 2009 study on black turnout in President Obama's first election. ""[D]oor-to-door, mail, phone, and Internet activities of the political parties may have been more of a factor in mobilizing Blacks than an amorphous, media-driven buzz surrounding Obama's charismatic and historic candidacy."" In other words, Obama the person was less important to black turnout than the Democratic Party's ties to black voters and the campaign's effort to broaden and strengthen those ties. Which, again, is fodder for the broader point: Representation is important to outreach with minority communities, but it's not dispositive. What counts most are ideas and policies that appeal to those communities, and an infrastructure that brings them to the polls. Which means that, for now, Republicans are stuck. They have a diverse field, but those candidates are tied to orthodoxy that doesn't appeal to most blacks and Latinos, to say nothing of the affective problems with the GOP field, from Trump's vocal bigotry to Chris Christie's not-so-subtle dog whistles. The Republican presidential primary might look more like America than the Democratic one, but that's not enough to win."	Why the GOP's Diverse Field Won't Matter to Black and Latino Voters

Another grim tally of the dead and wounded. Another killer full of hate, from a land that breeds such men. Like millions of migrants before him, the perpetrator crossed the border unchallenged. And like others, he struck our country without warning. Our politicians say they'll stop these killers. They talk about building walls and vetting refugees. If we were serious, we would do it. We would seal our borders against North Carolina. North Carolina? It sounds absurd. When we think about immigration and terrorism, we think of Syria. But that's not where our casualties are coming from. On Friday, a gunman killed three people and wounded nine more at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado. The suspect is white American Robert Lewis Dear. When police apprehended Dear, he uttered one telltale phrase: ""no more baby parts."" People who have known or met Dear say he wasn't a regular churchgoer. But they also report that he believed devoutly in the Bible and that he claimed to have read it ""cover to cover."" In an online forum, Dear apparently spoke of Jesus and the ""end times."" He painted or posted crosses on at least three of his homes. Dear moved to Colorado last year from North Carolina, where he had been living. For two decades, the Tar Heel State has been a hotbed of religious extremism, fueled by clerics who preach holy war. The result is a stream of interstate terrorism. It began with Eric Rudolph, a Holocaust denier who grew up in the Christian Identity movement. In 1996, Rudolph traveled from North Carolina to Atlanta, where he detonated a bomb at the Olympics, killing one person and injuring more than 100 others. A year later, Rudolph bombed a lesbian bar in Atlanta, wounding five people. In 1998, he bombed a reproductive health clinic in Birmingham, Alabama, killing a security guard and injuring a nurse. The ""Army of God,"" which hosts Rudolph's writings, claimed credit for his attacks. In 2001, Steve Anderson, another Christian Identity follower, was pulled over for a broken tail light on his way home from a white supremacist meeting in North Carolina. He pumped 20 bullets into the officer's car and fled. Police found weapons, ammunition, and explosives in his truck and home. A year later, he was captured in the western part of the state. In 2010, Justin Moose, an extremist from Concord, North Carolina, was arrested for plotting to blow up a Planned Parenthood clinic. Moose, who claimed to represent the Army of God, also opposed the construction of a mosque near ground zero in New York. He called himself the ""Christian counterpart of Osama Bin Laden."" Eventually, Moose pleaded guilty to disseminating information on how to make and use explosive devices. In 2014, Frazier Glenn Miller, a career anti-Semite and former grand dragon of the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, killed three people at a Jewish community center and a Jewish retirement home in Kansas. Decades ago, long before ISIS conceived of an Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, Miller devised a similar plan in the United States: an ""all-white nation within the bounds of North and South Carolina."" Among dozens of avowedly Christian, anti-Semitic, and right-wing terrorists cataloged by the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center, you'll find many from these two states: Charles Robert Barefoot Jr., a North Carolina Klan leader who was convicted in 2012 on charges involving firearms, explosives, and violent conspiracy. Kody Brittingham, a Marine at Camp Lejeune who confessed to plotting the assassination of President Obama. Paul Chastain, a South Carolina militiaman who tried to acquire plastic explosives and threatened to kill federal officials. Steve Bixby, a violent activist from an anti-Semitic household, who gunned down two police officers in Abbeville, South Carolina. Daniel Schertz, a Klansman arrested in Greenville, South Carolina, and later convicted, on weapons charges involving racist bomb plots. And then there's Dylann Roof. After allegedly murdering nine black people in a Charleston, South Carolina, church this summer, Roof drove more than three hours north, to Shelby, North Carolina. Nobody stopped him at the state border. The boundary between North and South Carolina, like the boundary between Syria and Iraq, is a joke. Today, Republican presidential candidates are climbing over one another in a race to block the entry of Syrian refugees. They're doing this even though, among the nearly 800,000 refugees we've accepted since 9/11, not one has been convicted of--or has even been arrested for--plotting a terror attack in this country. (A few have been arrested for links to terrorism elsewhere.) Why do refugees have such a clean record? Because they have to go through an elaborate process: screening by U.N. evaluators, ""biometric and biographic checks,"" consultations with U.S. counterterrorism agencies, and an in-person interview with the Department of Homeland Security. On average, the process takes about a year and a half--or, in the case of Syrian refugees, about two years. Terrorists from North Carolina encounter no such scrutiny. They just climb into their cars, cross the border, and proceed to Georgia, Kansas, or Colorado. They're protected by Article IV of the Constitution, which, as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court, guarantees citizens ""the right of free ingress into other States."" That's why, among the 27 fatal terror attacks inflicted in this country since 9/11, 20 were committed by domestic right-wing extremists. (The other seven attacks were committed by domestic jihadists, not by foreign terrorist organizations.) Of the 77 people killed in these 27 incidents, two-thirds died at the hands of anti-abortion fanatics, ""Christian Identity"" zealots, white anti-Semites, or other right-wing militants. This week's carnage in Colorado brings the death toll from North Carolinian terrorists, including Eric Rudolph, to eight. That's just one shy of the nine people murdered in Charleston. Throw in the work of a few lesser miscreants, and you're looking at roughly 20 casualties inflicted by Carolina extremists. That doesn't make the Christian states of North and South Carolina anywhere near as dangerous as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. But it does make you wonder why, as we close our doors to refugees who have done us no harm, we pay so little attention to our enemies within."	Forget Syria. The Most Dangerous Migrants Are From North Carolina.
20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/the_republican_party_s_immigration_and_refugee_positions_defy_the_bible.html	"Nicholas Kristof wrote an op-ed over the weekend that highlighted the irony of recent Republican response to the Syrian refugee crisis. The New York Times columnist made the not-so-subtle observation that Republicans would likely have denied asylum to one of history's more significant immigrant families: ""a carpenter named Joseph, his wife, Mary, and their baby son, Jesus,"" who, according to Matthew's Gospel, were forced to seek refuge in Egypt to escape King Herod's infanticide. It's a fair point, but there's no reason to limit it to the story of Jesus. The truth is the Bible's authors have an awful lot to say about immigration, forced or otherwise, and their perspective flies directly in the face of the Republican Party's jingoistic zeal for border-strengthening and turning our backs on refugees. Given the GOP's enthusiasm for biblically based governance, Republican leaders might want to consider the chasm separating their current immigration policies and the source document upon which they claim to base some of their politics. The story of the ancient Israelites' exodus from Egypt is perhaps the most obvious biblical story about refugees. Although biblical scholars are divided concerning the veracity of a historical Exodus, folks like Sen. Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee are most likely in the ""it really happened"" camp. If so, the striking parallels between this story and the journeys of those fleeing Syria should give them pause. Like the Syrians, Israelites, spurred by the hope for a better future, fled an oppressive regime and endured a lengthy and dangerous journey (Exodus 1:11; 16:3; Deuteronomy 2:14; Joshua 1:6). Regardless of whether this actually happened, the self-conception of Israelites as a refugee people had a profound effect on their writing and culture. Consider the story of Ruth. In this book, Ruth is described as fleeing her homeland of Moab due to famine. She then moves to Judah with her mother-in-law, Naomi, after hearing about the Judeans' abundance of food (Ruth 1:6). Ruth and Naomi are both widows, a particularly vulnerable class in an ancient world that bestowed women with virtually no socio-political power. Naomi even cautions Ruth against coming with her, urging, ""Return home, my daughters. Why would you come with me?"" Ruth insists, however, professing openness to whatever her future in Judah may hold: ""Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried"" (Ruth 1:16-17). Ruth's commitment to her only remaining family and optimism about an unknown future should sound familiar to any who reads the testimonials of modern-day immigrants. Upon arriving in Judah, she works, gathering the scraps of food left over from the harvest, a common practice of migrants in her time (Ruth 2:3). When Boaz--the owner of the field--notices her, he, instead of rebuking her for eating from his field, orders his workers to ""pull out some stalks for her from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up."" Later in the story, Boaz marries Ruth--a somewhat surprising inclusion given the Bible's reticence toward exogamy--and their marriage is venerated by its inclusion in Matthew's genealogy, which names the pair as direct ancestors of both King David and Jesus (Matthew 1:5). The parallels between this story and the present day are obvious. A pair of women, lacking the means to provide for themselves in their famine-stricken homeland, immigrate to a country of relative abundance. In order to eat, they work as agricultural day laborers. Ultimately, they marry and assimilate into a new society where their descendants are remembered among the culture's chief political and religious leaders. You don't have to squint hard to see signs of the American Dream peeking through. Yet somehow the political party of ""biblical values"" continues to endorse not only building a wall to bar the entry of modern-day Ruths and Naomis but, increasingly, a far-fetched scheme to evict those already living in our midst. These plans are typically justified by invocations to protect American citizens and thinly veiled racial anxiety about our country's changing demographics. The Bible, too, has stories about immigrants moving to occupied territories--potentially disrupting the lives of the regions' current residents and changing the nations' direction--except, in these stories, the immigrants are not the villains but the protagonists. The life of Abraham, to whom Jews, Muslims, and Christians all trace their lineage, is one such tale. God tells Abraham, ""go from your country ... to the land that I will show you"" and promises to make his descendants into ""a great nation,"" concluding: ""to your offspring I will give this land."" The author notes that the intended land is inhabited (""at that time the Canaanites were in the land"") but does not even consider that this might be a reason not to go (Genesis 12: 1-2; 6-7). Read from a Canaanite perspective, Abraham is the very definition of an immigrant who travels through a neighboring country's porous borders, dramatically altering the demographics and future of that region. And, viewed as a Canaanite, there's no greater ""anchor baby"" than Abraham's son, Isaac. The fact that Abraham and Isaac are remembered as biblical heroes says a lot about the Bible's perspective on immigrants. Biblical exhortations to welcome immigrants--and treat them fairly--feature strongly in the Bible's legal codes as well. Numbers 9, for example, orders the creation of single statute, ""for both the resident alien and the native."" Deuteronomy 24 prohibits ""[depriving] a resident alien ... of justice."" The prophets address the topic, as well: Jeremiah 22 includes an admonition from the Lord to ""do no wrong or violence to the alien,"" and Malachi 3 speaks of a messenger from the Lord who will ""be swift to bear witness ... against those who thrust aside the alien."" This theme continues into the New Testament, too. In the 12th chapter of his letter to the Romans, Paul names ""[extending] hospitality to strangers"" as one of the marks of a true Christian. Jesus himself instructs his disciples that they will encounter him by welcoming the strangers in their midst (Matthew 25:31-41). This should not come as a shock, given Jesus' status as a refugee and his tribal identification as an Israelite. Indeed, Leviticus 19 encourages Israelites to remember their own immigration histories when interacting with foreigners, instructing ""the alien who resides with you shall be to you as the citizen among you ... for you were aliens in the land of Egypt."" As a nation of immigrants, the mandate to remember one's own immigrant history and to treat ""the alien who resides with you ... as the citizen among you"" ought to hit close to home, particularly for those like Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio who frequently incorporate their own families' recent immigration histories as part of their personal stories. I can't support a literal reading of the Bible or a scriptural basis for government policy. The Bible is a book written thousands of years ago, and thus the Bible, read literally, often promotes policy I find abhorrent--and running counter to the larger biblical message--including support for capital punishment, limitations on the rights of women, and prohibitions against nonheteronormative relationships, to name a few. However, on the topic of immigration, the Bible hits it on the nose. The biblical witness is empathetic to the plight of refugees and immigrants and consistent in its message to the reader: ""you shall love the alien as yourself, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt"" (Leviticus 19:34). For a party whose leaders claim to stand on the side of the Bible, it might behoove them to brush up on what the Bible actually says about immigrants."	The GOP's Position on Refugees Contradicts the Bible's Teachings
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/super_pacs_plan_to_attack_donald_trump_the_gop_front_runner_can_use_the.html	"Donald Trump is talking up an independent presidential bid again after a brief peace of two to three months. Why? Probably because he just says whatever he feels like saying at any given time. If we're looking for something resembling a concrete proximate cause, though, it would be the recent chatter that vaguely establishment-aligned outside groups are gunning for him. New Day for America, a super PAC nominally supporting Ohio Gov. John Kasich has corralled donors from various Republican Party establishment camps for the express purpose of taking down Trump in his New Hampshire stronghold and beyond. ""The attack,"" as Politico first reported, ""will play out over the next two months on radio, TV, mail and online in New Hampshire."" Kasich's own campaign will run ads against Trump, too. Meanwhile, Liz Mair, a veteran GOP operative and opposition researcher, is ""planning a 'guerrilla campaign' backed by secret donors to 'defeat and destroy' the celebrity businessman's candidacy,"" the Wall Street Journal reported late last week. Trump is arguing, Trumpily, that this may count as the Republican Party treating him ""unfairly,"" the cavernous opt out to which the RNC supposedly agreed in exchange for Trump's signature on a worthless piece of paper in September. ""I'm going to have to see what happens. I will see what happens. I have to be treated fairly,"" Trump told ABC's George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. ""You know, when I did this, I said I have to be treated fairly. If I'm treated fairly, I'm fine. All I want to do is a level playing field."" Trump's hit man and counsel Michael Cohen reiterated on CNN Tuesday morning that if the GOP ""break[s] that agreement with him, as they say, woe be on them,"" adding that the super PACs going after Trump are making a ""bad, bad decision."" There's a 99.9 percent chance this is a bluff, but it's a powerful one: If Trump did follow through with an independent bid, Hillary Clinton would become president. Does that threat give the super PAC generals leading these assaults the chills? ""What gives me chills is the idea that Trump could become the GOP nominee, or if he catches lightning in a bottle, president,"" Mair tells Slate. ""In reality, he's probably going to have ballot access issues if he tries to go third party. ""I think Trump is a pretty garden variety, bigmouthed bully who likes to scare people into giving him what he wants by making wild threats,"" she continued. ""It's generally bad practice to let bullies get whatever they want, and I think that remains the case here."" Trump does not want to run an independent bid for the presidency. And if he did, it wouldn't be because some super PACs loosely tethered to the ""establishment""--i.e., all Republicans who hope Trump doesn't become the party's presidential nominee--ran ads against him in New Hampshire. If they didn't run these ads, and Trump lost the nomination for some other reason, then he would just come up with another excuse about how the GOP wasn't ""fair"" to him as a foundation for the independent run he won't launch anyway. The more questionable aspect to the super PACs' strategy is how they're going to sway his supporters from their establishment perch. Trump supporters are, to use the euphemistic term preferred by consultants, ""sticky."" They are stubborn as hell, and none of Trump's hourly gaffes that have terrified the establishment class have shaken the resolve of his dedicated fans. This should be plenty obvious to everyone who is not a Trump supporter and spends all day banging his head against the wall wondering how anyone could possibly support Donald Trump for president of the United States. We'll see what Mair's group comes up with. But how is New Day for America, propped up by establishment megadonors supporting Kasich, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Jeb Bush, going to change the picture? Consider New Day for America's first ad against Trump that's part of a ""digital buy"" in New Hampshire and Ohio, released Monday to coincide with Trump's visit to the state. To use the highly sophisticated jargon of political science, this is super-duper lame. It's a collection of the various comments pundits predicted would ruin Trump over the past six months that haven't ruined Trump. He is silly and nasty and pervy, yes. Trump supporters either don't care or like him specifically for that. What else? There's this new clip from the official Kasich campaign. It's a much better spot, assailing Trump for his comments suggesting Muslims' constitutional rights should be violated. Good show! But again: How will this change the minds of Trump supporters, many of whom might fancy the idea of Muslims losing their constitutional rights? Especially when Trump can swat the accusations away by telling his supporters, credibly, that it's the work of GOP establishmentarians? I am not here just to trash everyone's so-far lousy ads. That's only a big part of it. Instead, let's consider the sort of figure that it will take to stop Trump. It has to be someone with impeccable conservative credibility: the sort of figure who can take on Trump's nonsense and lies without the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Breitbart News running interference. It's got to be Sen. Ted Cruz, who's moved into a statistical tie with Trump in Iowa. Cruz has already started pushing off Trump in an effort to position himself as a compromise candidate between the nonpoliticians and the establishmentarians. Now that they're 1-2 in the first caucus state, we--and Trump, and the rest of the GOP--will be interested to see where Cruz pushes things next. If Cruz can take down Trump and assume his voters, though, it would be a Pyrrhic victory for the establishment: They'll have eliminated the big problem, but then they'll be saddled with a dominant Ted Cruz. At that point, they just might have to accept it."	Why the Super PACs Don't Scare Donald Trump
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/donald_trump_is_a_conservative_media_creation_right_wing_media_has_engaged.html	"Donald Trump has spent most of his campaign indulging and encouraging nativism and anti-immigrant sentiment. When it came to other racial and ethnic groups, however, Trump was silent, even telling crowds that he had a ""great relationship with the blacks."" This past weekend, that changed. On Saturday, Trump spoke to thousands at a rally in Birmingham, Alabama. At some point, a local black activist--shouting ""Black Lives Matter!--interrupted the event. This prompted a fight, and soon, the activist was on the ground as several men kicked and punched him. The crowd booed, cheered, and chanted, ""All lives matter."" Trump wanted him removed. ""Get him the hell out of here, will you, please?"", he said. ""Get him out of here. Throw him out!"" The next day, on Fox News, Trump was unsympathetic to the protester. ""Maybe he should have been roughed up because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing,"" he said. The same Sunday, in an interview on ABC's This Week, Trump told George Stephanopolous that ""thousands and thousands of people""--Arab Americans--were ""cheering"" as the World Trade Center fell on Sept. 11, 2001. This is false--there's no evidence it happened. Trump, however, doesn't seem to care. And later that evening, on Twitter, he ""retweeted"" an image of alleged racial crime statistics from the nonexistent ""Crime Statistics Bureau"" in San Francisco. The chart--which also depicts a (presumably black) gang member holding a gun--claims that 81 percent of white Americans are killed by blacks, and that 97 percent of black Americans are also killed by blacks. This is also racist, and it's also false: According to the latest homicide data from the FBI, 82 percent of whites in 2014 were killed by whites, and 90 percent of blacks were killed by blacks. Just under 15 percent of whites were killed by blacks. All of this reflects the fear and bigotry that animates much of Trump's campaign. And in fact, the false crime meme literally comes from online ""white nationalists."" But while Trump has been explicit with his nativist, and now racist, rhetoric, he's not an innovator. If large numbers of Republicans are responsive to Trump's vitriol, it's because he echoes--in less coded terms--the discourse of much of right-wing media. In conservative entertainment, race panic sells. And if you've watched Fox News at all in the past seven years, followed websites like Breitbart, or listened to conservative talk radio, you've experienced it. During his heyday in 2009, Glenn Beck warned that President Obama had a ""deep-seated hatred for white people"" and that the Affordable Care Act was a stealth vehicle for reparations. ""[T]his is what he said on the campaign trail--he's not for reparations because they don't go far enough,"" explained Beck to his audience. ""We need health care."" Echoing him, Rush Limbaugh urged his listeners to stay alert, since--in the age of Obama--""The days of [minorities] not having any power are over, and they are angry ... And they want to use their power as a means of retribution. That's what Obama's about, gang."" The next year, Fox ran hyped coverage of the ""New Black Panther Party,"" a small extremist group accused of election intimidation. The actual incident was minor--two men brandishing a nightstick at a heavily Democratic polling place in Philadelphia in 2008--but Fox's Megyn Kelly, who hyped the story that year, made it a harbinger of anti-white terror. As David Weigel wrote at the time for Andrew Sullivan's Daily Dish, ""Watch her broadcasts and you become convinced that the New Black Panthers are a powerful group that hate white people and operate under the protection of Eric Holder's DOJ."" During George Zimmerman's 2013 trial for the shooting of Trayvon Martin, the network moved to constant coverage of ""black-on-black"" and, especially, ""black-on-white"" crime. One story--the murder of Christopher Lane, an Australian exchange student in Oklahoma, by a group of black and white teens--received special attention, including segments on an alleged epidemic of black crime against whites. ""Look, the most common form of interracial hate crime is black on white,"" said Pat Buchanan during a segment with Greta van Susteren. ""The idea of racial hate crimes is 40 times more prevalent in the black community than the white community. And nobody talks about it."" Likewise, at popular right-wing websites like Breitbart and Human Events, writers warned their readers of the ""knockout game,"" where black teens would attack unsuspecting whites with a knockout punch to the head. ""Coming soon to a city near you: The knockout game,"" reads one headline among many. On any given day, conservative personalities like Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity are denouncing ""thugs"" and ""thug culture,"" while mainstream conservative writers are warning of crime waves sparked by black political activism. All of this is also true for immigration coverage. Fox personalities, in particular, routinely disparage Latin American and Hispanic immigrants as vectors for crime and disease. ""Sadly, people are murdered all the time by illegals,"" declared Fox & Friends' Steve Doocy in one segment. And on his radio show, defending Trump, Hannity has denounced immigrants in similar terms as the presidential candidate. ""You want to talk about crime? Well what do you think--who's coming from Latin America and Mexico? Are they rich, successful Mexicans, Nicaraguans, El Salvador residents? No! Why would they leave if they're so successful?"" And most recently, Fox News hosted a forum on Islam in public schools, where host Keith Ablow demanded that schools teach students that Muslims are ""on the march where they'd like to destroy the United States."" This material just scratches the surface of the race panic that's ubiquitious throughout conservative media, from breathless coverage of Black Lives Matter on Fox News (a ""hate group"" that's ""like the Ku Klux Klan"") and fearmongering on immigrant crime from conservative radio hosts, to race-baiting on conservative websites. And it reaches millions of Americans, many of them Republicans, who listen and watch it as part of their daily lives. Of course Trump would sound off on immigrant crime and disloyal Muslims and criminal blacks. He is fundamentally an entertainer, and in conservative entertainment, those are the money shots: The stories that capture attention and drive ratings. And on the same score, his supporters--the tens of thousands of people who show up for his rallies--are thrilled to hear them. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Donald Trump Is a Conservative Media Creation
23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/unitedhealth_group_sustaining_heavy_losses_is_obamacare_doomed.html	"Is Obamacare in trouble? This week, UnitedHealth Group, America's largest health insurer, announced that it had sustained heavy losses in selling insurance on the Obamacare exchanges and that it might be forced to pull out of the exchanges altogether. The news from other insurers is not much better. Aetna, Anthem, and Cigna, three of UnitedHealth's biggest competitors, will no longer offer exchange coverage in a number of counties across the country, which could be a sign that they'll retrench even further in the future. You might have heard that insurance premiums on the exchanges are rising substantially, which isn't exactly welcome news. But the bigger problem is arguably that insurers have been trying to hold down premium increases by narrowing the range of providers in their networks and hiking deductibles as high as they can. The result has been a spate of stories about disgruntled insurance beneficiaries, many of whom blame Obamacare for their woes. None of this is to suggest Obamacare is about to get repealed. President Obama would veto any legislation to that effect. Nor does the parlous state of the exchanges have any effect on the Medicaid expansion, which has greatly increased insurance coverage in the states that have accepted it. Yet the problems facing the exchanges are important all the same. During the Obamacare debate, Democrats were divided over whether they ought to pursue a comprehensive overhaul of federal health insurance policy or if they should instead pass a ""skinny bill,"" an incremental, stripped-down version of Obamacare that would just include popular provisions like expanding Medicaid and imposing new consumer-friendly regulations on insurers. George W. Bush presided over a big Medicaid expansion, so why couldn't Obama? Proponents of a ""skinny bill,"" like Rahm Emanuel, then President Obama's chief of staff, warned that there wasn't enough public support for anything more ambitious. Advocates of a more comprehensive approach won out, in large part by arguing that you couldn't prevent insurers from denying coverage on the basis of pre-existing conditions (popular) without also ensuring that healthy people had little choice but to buy coverage (unpopular). That's because, if people didn't buy coverage when they were healthy, they might just buy coverage when they developed expensive illnesses, which would mean insurers would have to spend huge amounts of money to finance medical care for the sick without the financial cushion of insurance premiums from the not-sick. This is why Obamacare was designed with carrots, like generous subsidies for low- and middle-income households to buy insurance coverage, and sticks, like the individual mandate penalty and a limited open enrollment period. So far, at least, Obamacare's mix of carrots and sticks isn't working terribly well. The reason insurers are having such a hard time is that the people who are buying insurance on the Obamacare exchanges are in much poorer health than insurers had anticipated, partly because healthier people are shying away from buying policies they consider much too expensive. You could call it Rahm's revenge--the whole point of passing a more ambitious, more politically risky version of Obamacare was to get enough healthy people to buy coverage, and that's exactly what hasn't been happening. This is not to say that healthy people won't eventually be corralled into buying insurance on the Obamacare exchanges. The individual mandate penalty is set to increase dramatically over the next two years, which might persuade some stragglers to buy insurance policies they don't find particularly attractive. It's just not clear that a ""buy this insurance policy--or else"" message will sell politically. Does this mean that Obamacare opponents now have the upper hand? Many conservatives, like Byron York of the Washington Examiner and Jeffrey Anderson of the 2017 Project, believe so. They see Obamacare's woes as a political opportunity for Republicans, and they might be right. The possibility they neglect, however, is that even though many middle-class voters are frustrated by Obamacare, the Democrats' most potent argument in its favor has always been the protection it offers the sick. Yes, the Obamacare exchanges are proving to be as dysfunctional as many conservatives had anticipated. But until Republicans can make a convincing case that they will do a better job of meeting the needs of Americans with pre-existing conditions, Obamacare is here to stay."

Bush gave brief remarks at the Islamic Center of Washington, just a short drive from the White House. ""These acts of violence against innocents violate the fundamental tenets of the Islamic faith,"" Bush said. ""The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam. That's not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace. These terrorists don't represent peace. They represent evil and war."" Bush couldn't stop or defuse anti-Muslim prejudice. That was impossible, and just a few weeks after he spoke, a 51-year-old Yemeni-American man was shot to death outside of his store, two days after someone left a note--""We're going to kill all f--king Arabs""--on his car windshield. But what Bush did, successfully, was keep anti-Islam and anti-Muslim rhetoric out of national politics. He made clear that the United States was fighting a war against terrorists--not Muslims--and reminded Americans that ""the majority of the victims of the terrorists have been innocent Muslims."" Bush worked hard to sow tolerance for Muslim-Americans, convinced--like President Obama--that respect and openness was an asset in the fight against jihadists. Integrated, assimilated communities don't give aid to violent extremists. In the week since the Paris attacks, however, his would-be successors--the 2016 Republican presidential field--have jettisoned these efforts. Now, much of the GOP is stirring anti-Muslim sentiment. And perhaps the only person who can stop it--or at least, turn down the heat--is Bush. At the moment, Republican rhetoric is spiraling out of control. Donald Trump, for example, is open to a ""database system"" to track Muslims. ""There should be a lot of systems, beyond databases,"" he said. And in an interview with Yahoo News, Trump said that ""we're going to have to do certain things that were frankly unthinkable a year ago,"" with regards to surveillance of Muslims. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, likewise, wants a religious test for refugees: We'll accept the Christians and reject the Muslims. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio isn't as extreme--although he's open to monitoring any place that spreads ""radicalism""--but he believes the Western world is in a fight against ""radical Islam,"" and is bewildered by those who don't follow his labeling. ""I don't understand it,"" said Rubio when asked about Hillary Clinton's pointed refusal to use the term in the last Democratic presidential debate. ""That would be like saying we weren't at war with the Nazis, because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi Party but weren't violent themselves,"" he said, comparing Islam--a vast religion with 1.6 billion adherents--to Nazism. And on Thursday, following all of this--as well as rhetoric from GOP governors and lawmakers--the House of Representatives voted to put new restrictions on refugees, ""drastically tightening screening procedures,"" despite the incredibly strict scrutiny already placed on refugees to the United States. Democrats are a part of this ugly politics, too. Forty-seven Democrats voted with 242 Republicans to pass the bill, and at least one local Democrat--the mayor of Roanoke, Virginia--has endorsed internment-style policies for Syrian refugees. But driving anti-refugee and anti-Muslim rhetoric are Republican politicians. This is dangerous. Not just because of damage it could do to our ideological struggle against jihadists, but because it corrodes the ties between citizens. Americans are afraid, and this validates their fears. It tells them, explicitly, that Muslim Americans are dangerous--a potential Fifth Column that needs monitoring, questioning, or worse. And for those prejudiced enough to do violence, it loosens the bonds that might keep them from acting on their fear and hatred. President Obama has urged Americans to show tolerance, but Republicans won't listen. Not only did he insult them, but this is a partisan issue and Republicans stand to gain. Why would they back down now? Because we're moving toward an ugly place. Because we shouldn't indulge our worst impulses. Because this rhetoric puts actual lives at risk--since Paris, authorities have seen a surge in anti-Muslim threats and vandalism. Republicans won't listen to Obama on this score, but they might heed George W. Bush, who still holds sway with the party. He doesn't need to say anything new or novel. He just needs to remind his party that there's more to politics than winning--that some victories aren't worth the cost to the country. ""America counts millions of Muslims amongst our citizens, and Muslims make an incredibly valuable contribution to our country,"" said Bush in his remarks at the Islamic Center in September 2001. ""Muslims are doctors, lawyers, law professors, members of the military, entrepreneurs, shopkeepers, moms and dads. And they need to be treated with respect. In our anger and emotion, our fellow Americans must treat each other with respect."" Now more than ever, this is what the Republican Party needs to hear."	America Needs George W. Bush to Speak to His Party
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/donald_trump_is_a_moderate_republican_that_s_why_he_s_winning.html	"When it's time to vote, Republicans usually choose an ""establishment"" candidate to lead their party: George H.W. Bush in 1988, Bob Dole in 1996, George W. Bush in 2000, John McCain in 2008, and Mitt Romney in 2012. Part of that is the strength of the people who raise money and push for specific policies, but part of it is the strength of establishment picks. These candidates fit a profile. They stand at the center of their parties with ties to the three ""legs"" of the modern GOP: social conservatives, national security conservatives, and anti-tax conservatives. They're not always strong with every group, but they are--or they become--acceptable through the course of the primary. They may not hold moderate positions, but they sound moderate and appeal to ordinary American voters. That candidate, or a version of that candidate, exists in the 2016 Republican primary. It's Jeb Bush, it's Sen. Marco Rubio, it's Gov. John Kasich--it's even Gov. Chris Christie. But they aren't the leaders of the race. They aren't even close. The leader is Donald Trump, a real estate mogul turned reality TV star turned nativist agitator. On the surface, Trump is the antithesis of a traditional Republican nominee. It's why I've been deeply skeptical of his chances. But look beyond Trump's affect--his brash, ""carnival barker"" approach to politics--and it's clear that, ideologically, he is the only candidate who fully fits the profile of the typical Republican nominee. Trump stands at the center of the GOP. He is the median Republican. Now, I know the argument against Trump's odds in the Republican primary. Even in our era of weak parties, elites have tremendous influence, and they don't choose people like Trump, who stand largely outside the party system. At the same time, voters matter, too. And while they usually ratify the establishment pick, they can also go off path, which is what we've seen with Trump. We're six months into his candidacy, and he still leads. Not by a little, and not by a bit, but by a lot. In the Huffington Post average of national Republican presidential polling, Trump leads with 32 percent support. His next closest competitor, Ben Carson, holds just 18.5 percent of GOP primary voters. And while it's true Trump hit turbulance after the presidential debates, he's recovered in the weeks since. Donald Trump is still on top. This is true in almost every state where pollsters are talking to Republican voters. Trump leads with 31 percent support in New Jersey, 27 percent in South Carolina, 27 percent in Florida, 26 percent in heavily-polled New Hampshire, 23 percent in Ohio and Pennsylvania, 22 percent in Texas, and 20 percent in California. Where he doesn't lead--Iowa, Georgia, and North Carolina--Carson holds the command. You can chalk some of this to media, lack of attention, and a paucity of polls. But not all of it. Consistently, across different regions of the country, Republicans are telling the people who ask that they want Trump for their party's nomination. If Trump were a sideshow like Newt Gingrich or Herman Cain, or a factional candidate like Carson or Mike Huckabee, this wouldn't be true. But he isn't. More than any other candidate in this race, Trump holds beliefs and positions that appeal to each part of the Republican Party. On national security and defense, he's a measured hawk. He won't invade for the sake of invading--he opposed the Iraq war, as he'll remind you--but he'll take the fight to the enemy, when necessary. ""When you're weak and ineffective, bad stuff does happen. And that's what we're seeing,"" Trump said in a recent speech. His promise? To ""bomb the shit"" out of ISIS and capture its oil fields. All of this is in line with Republican voters--in a recent Reuters poll, 36 percent said he was best equipped to handle terrorism. On taxes, he's in the Republican mainstream. His tax cuts would slash rates across the board, with the largest gains for the wealthiest Americans. It goes beyond Bush's plan, in particular, to offer a lower rate for individuals and corporations. Rhetoric aside--he routinely hits hedge fund managers for paying low taxes--Trump is in line with supply-side and anti-tax conservatives who want less revenue for government programs. That said, Trump rejects cuts to Social Security and Medicare. Retirement programs--the bulk of the benefits that touch actual Republican voters--are sacrosanct. And this as well puts him in the center of the GOP as it exists. Trump has the most trouble on social conservatism. He won't oppose same-sex marriage--he almost certainly supports it--and until his run for president, he was pro-choice. Now, he says he's ""pro-life with exceptions"" for rape, incest, and the health of the mother, which puts him out of step with anti-abortion activists but in line with a substantial minority of Republicans. And then there's immigration. It cuts across every other issue in the Republican Party, touching national security, the economy, and the fabric of our national culture. GOP elites, going back to Ronald Reagan, have supported more permissive immigration laws; George W. Bush tried to pass comprehensive reform, Sen. John McCain supported it, and most recently, Rubio tried to craft a bill. But substantial numbers of Republican voters have always opposed immigration, and in the last five years, it's become a driving force in conservative politics. To win the nomination, for instance, Mitt Romney had to renounce ""amnesty"" and position himself against any immigration reform. Trump's core message is on immigration. It's the reason he's running. He wants to close the borders to ""illegals"" and deport most of the 11 million unauthorized migrants to the country. ""They have to go,"" as he often says. If Republican elites are to the left of their voters on immigration, Trump is simpatico with the base. And it shows in polls--49 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say that Trump can best handle immigration. Fifty-five percent agree with his statement that Mexico sends people that bring ""crime"" and ""rapists,"" and 77 percent disagree with Bush's statement that unauthorized immigration is an ""act of love."" You can see Trump's position as the median Republican in the composition of his supporters. Twenty percent call themselves ""moderate"" or ""liberal,"" 65 percent say they're ""conservative,"" and just 13 percent call themselves ""very conservative."" Age wise, about half are between 45 and 64, while 34 percent are over 65. And in terms of income, his support trends toward working- and middle-class Republicans. These are GOP voters. They are the mainstream. Yes, Trump is unacceptable to a large share of Republican voters. Yes, he has high unfavorables. But his beliefs--and especially those on immigration--draw Republicans from all sides of the party. Let's put it this way: If Trump were more polished, if he looked and sounded more like Rubio and Bush, we would see him, correctly, as a mainstream candidate for president. Set aside his affect, and Trump sits at the center of the GOP, and that is why he's winning."	Donald Trump Is Actually a Moderate Republican
26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/hillary_clinton_triangulates_against_bernie_sanders.html	"The Hillary Clinton presidential campaign has begun using an odd new line of attack against upstart Democratic primary rival Sen. Bernie Sanders: He's too liberal on taxes and universal health insurance. Why is she doing this? After returning to the position in which she entered the race--as the near-certain nominee--she seems to be setting herself up for the general election. But it's strange to see her now, after the previously shaky ship has been steadied, attacking a candidate whose supporters she'll need in any general election campaign over an issue that his supporters care about very deeply. Triangulating against Sanders (and, by proxy, the left wing of the Democratic Party) with conservative attacks does make some sense. For one, she is a Clinton, and this is what they do. At issue is Sanders' support for a single-payer universal health care system, which he and others brand as ""Medicare for all."" A single-payer bill he introduced in 2013 would have levied a 2.2 percent tax on individuals making up to $200,000 or couples making up to $250,000, and progressively increased that rate to 5.2 percent for income beyond $600,000. It also would have tacked an extra 6.7 percent payroll tax on the employer side, at least some of which employers would likely pass on to workers. The Clinton campaign is suddenly quite upset about that proposal and wants everyone to know. She has committed to the same (policy-constricting) pledge that President Obama took in 2008 and 2012, ruling out tax increases on individuals making less than $200,000 per year or joint filers making less than $250,000. This neatly positions her camp to say, by contrast, that the bug-eyed socialist Bernie Sanders wants to take all of your money. ""Bernie Sanders has called for a roughly 9-percent tax hike on middle-class families just to cover his health-care plan,"" a Clinton spokesman said Tuesday, via Politico. ""Simple math dictates he'll need to tax workers even more to pay for the rest of his at least $18-20 trillion agenda. If you are truly concerned about raising incomes for middle-class families, the last thing you should do is cut their take-home pay right off the bat by raising their taxes."" This is a truly messed-up thing for the leading Democratic presidential candidate, who claims to be a progressive stalwart, to be broadcasting. A standard Democratic presidential nominee representing the center-left of the party might call a single-payer system politically impractical in order to argue against it. ""If I were designing a system from scratch, I would probably go ahead with a single-payer system,"" Sen. Barack Obama said during his 2008 presidential campaign, for example. He then explained why he wouldn't pursue such a model: ""People don't have time to wait. They need relief now. So my attitude is let's build up the system we got. Let's make it more efficient. We may be over time--as we make the system more efficient and everybody's covered--decide that there are other ways for us to provide care more effectively."" In the end that approach resulted in the Affordable Care Act, compromise legislation that greatly expanded coverage without really overhauling the country's private health insurance model. But Obama didn't really disown the idea of single-payer, which many progressives still prefer to the current system. Clinton, however, is going much further by appropriating one of the right's central talking points against government-funded universal health insurance: Think of the taxes! She's not just saying that a single-payer system is a political nonstarter with conservatives. She's reciting the actual conservative talking point that would make a single-payer system a political nonstarter. There are fairly obvious policy counterpoints to that argument. She is well-aware of them and chooses to ignore them, because they would either blunt or negate her convenient political attack. Sure, under Sanders' plan, the combination of the income and payroll taxes would add up to 8.9 percent (assuming employers pass on the full 6.7 percent payroll tax) on most earners. But people would not be paying for health insurance anymore, and a universal, public system would save money by eliminating all of the actuarial costs and profit expectations associated with the private insurance system. If Clinton wanted to say that she wouldn't push for a single-payer system because it's a political dead-ender right now, or because she's spotted another legitimate policy flaw with the idea, that would be more acceptable. What she's doing, instead, is essentially red-baiting about Bernie Sanders' Wacky Taxes in her dismissal of a policy that, on paper, draws plenty of support among Democratic voters. That's not good for the single-payer health care movement, which is hoping that some blue states will be able to use ACA waivers to experiment with single-payer in their states but so far are running into trouble thanks to the exact talking point Clinton's deploying. And it's not good for American liberalism in general, which is supposed to defend the belief that government funded by taxes can solve problems and improve people's livelihoods. Perhaps the Clinton campaign has some horrific polling data that's leading them to launch this direct assault on Sanders, or it's just trying to distract everyone from Clinton's bizarre explanation at Saturday's debate for her voluminous contributions from Wall Street over the years. But it also seems like Clinton feels like she has the nomination secure and is triangulating ahead of the general election, mortgaging progressive policy in the process. Does that sound familiar?

""We have no idea who they're letting into our country, and our country has enough problems,"" said Donald Trump in an interview with ABC News' Barbara Walters. ""We have enough problems."" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was even more adamant. ""I do not trust this administration to effectively vet the people who are supposed to be coming in in order to protect the safety and security of the American people, so I would not permit them in,"" said the Republican, who is trailing in the party's presidential race. ""The fact is that we need for appropriate vetting, and I don't think that orphans under 5 should be admitted to the United States at this point."" Others, like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, want a religious test for refugees, and will propose legislation that bans Muslim Syrian refugees from entering the United States. ""What Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are proposing is that we bring to this country tens of thousands of Syrian Muslim refugees,"" said Cruz in an interview with CNN on Monday. ""I have to say particularly in light of what happened in Paris, that's nothing short of lunacy."" President Obama, who plans to continue refugee settlement in the United States, thinks this is ridiculous. ""I cannot think of a more potent recruitment tool for ISIL than some of the rhetoric coming out here in the course of this debate,"" said Obama at a press conference in the Phillippines Wednesday morning. ""ISIL seeks to exploit the idea that there's war between Islam and the West, and when you start seeing individuals in positions of responsibility suggesting Christians are more worthy of protection than Muslims are in a war-torn land that feeds the ISIL narrative. It's counter-productive. And it needs to stop."" He continued this riff with a dig at Republicans who want to refuse refugees. ""And I would add these are the same folks who suggested they're so tough that just talk to Putin or staring down ISIL ... but they're scared of widows and orphans coming into the United States of America as part of our tradition of compassion. First they were worried the press was too tough on them in the debates; now they're worried about 3-year-old orphans. That doesn't sound very tough to me."" Conservatives have called this a ""cheap shot,"" but it's not wrong. For all of their bellicose rhetoric, the refugee problem has left Republicans looking like paper tigers, at least with regard to the facts. If Western Europe has a flood of refugees and a strained system for screening and vetting the influx, the United States has the opposite. Since October 2014, just 1,869 Syrians have come to the United States. Republicans like Trump, Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorina say that Obama wants to bring an additional 100,000--or more--but that's a gross exaggeration. At most, the White House has set a goal of bringing 10,000 Syrians to the country in the next year. Moreover, and vital to questions of security, those 10,000 have undergone heavy scrutiny. First, there's the usual process for refugees who want to come to the United States. After passing background checks, a potential refugee is referred to the United States from the United Nation's refugee agency. Then, our government does its own screening, individually vetting each applicant. For Syrians, there's an additional step:"	Republicans Are Being Cowardly in Rejecting Syrian Refugees
28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/republican_presidential_candidates_are_no_longer_critical_of_surveillance.html	"""We're vulnerable,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, one of the top hawks in the 2016 presidential race, said Monday evening at a summit convened by the Wall Street Journal. ""What happened in Paris could happen in a major American city, at any moment, at any time."" And if it does, well, guess who may be partly to blame, aside from the nefarious Democrats? ""At least two of my colleagues in the Senate aspiring to the presidency--Sen. Cruz in particular--have voted to weaken the U.S. intelligence programs just in the last month and a half,"" Rubio went on. ""And the weakening of our intelligence gathering capabilities leaves America vulnerable."" The smoothest candidate in the race then matter-of-factly lumped Cruz and his fellow intelligence-savaging legislators with the disclosures of the ""traitor, Edward Snowden,"" as the two developments that ""will cost us the ability to gather actionable intelligence against elements operating in our territory."" Rubio's aides wasted little time retweeting coverage of the remarks and playing up a hashtag, #PhonyTedCruz. (Because Cruz made it more difficult to listen in on terrorists/anyone on the phone? Or because Cruz is considered a phony person? Both? Does it matter?) Rubio was widely believed to be referring to Cruz's vote on the USA Freedom Act, a piece of legislation originally conceived in 2013 following Snowden's disclosures and finally passed this year. The act trimmed intelligence agencies' bulk metadata gathering capabilities. It's not clear what Rubio meant when he said ""in the last month and a half,"" since the act passed in June. Also, Sen. Rand Paul voted against it--though because he, like other surveillance reform advocates, didn't think it went far enough in overhauling the Patriot Act. The Rubio campaign did not respond to a request for clarification. Cruz's campaign, a similarly smooth operation, was prepared with a cheeky response. ""Does Sen. Rubio attribute the same attack to Sens. Scott, Ayotte, and Grassley who also voted for it?"" replied Cruz press secretary Catherine Frazier to Slate, neatly siding Cruz with popular GOP senators representing, respectively, the three early voting states of South Carolina, New Hampshire, and Iowa. ""Cruz is a proud supporter of the bill which champions both the protection of our privacy rights and Americans' national security interests."" The USA Freedom Act didn't disrupt the country's intelligence gathering capabilities all that much. President Obama, who, like Rubio, has a dim view of Snowden's actions, wouldn't have signed it into law if it did. And though Cruz still considers himself a ""proud supporter"" of the law, it's hard to believe, post-Paris, that you will see him on the Senate floor participating in Paul's next marathon speech against the U.S. surveillance state. And that assumes that Paul, set back yet again by a terrorist attack abroad that's stirring up the hawkish elements in his party, devotes much time to the surveillance state going forward. The surveillance state itself certainly sees an opening to press its advantage after suffering years of abuse at the hands of progressive Democrats and libertarian-leaning Republicans. CIA Director John Brennan, whose 2013 confirmation was subject to a rousing, well-supported filibuster from Paul, lashed out at surveillance critics Monday. ""I would anticipate that this is not the only operation ISIL has in the pipeline,"" he said, going on to mock the ""hand-wringing"" over government surveillance. And many current and former intelligence officials have lamented to Yahoo News, among others, that the Snowden disclosures have allowed plotters to shift their communications to more untraceable methods. The Republican Party appears to be siding more with surveillance advocates than government intrusion critics. Donald Trump--a good bellwether for the Republican base's id--has said that he would ""strongly consider"" shutting down U.S. mosques and, were he merciful enough to leave them open, would merely subject them to blatantly unconstitutional surveillance efforts. These are some seriously extreme comments, and they will be met with an overwhelmingly positive reception from his supporters. Rep. Peter King said that it's time to put ""political correctness"" aside and ""have surveillance in the Muslim communities."" Rep. Joe Barton asked at a House hearing on Tuesday if there is ""something we can do"" to shut the parts of the Internet that ISIS uses. Barton did concede that shutting down lots and lots of websites might be difficult because ""they pop up like weeds."" The Republican side is far from unanimous, post-Paris, about how to respond to ISIS militarily. Though none would argue that they're satisfied with the Obama administration's strategy of targeted airstrikes and limited special operations on the ground, only a few--Jeb Bush, Sen. Lindsey Graham, and Gov. John Kasich--actively support the deployment of ground troops to the region. Others, like Cruz, Rubio, and Trump, seem to think that more bombing, along with ground efforts from regional allies, would do the trick. But when it comes to homeland security? It's sure looking like whatever brief flirtation some in the GOP had with reining in the broad, post-9/11 surveillance apparatus will dissipate."

29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/ted_cruz_visits_bob_jones_university_the_texas_senator_thinks_he_is_the.html	"GREENVILLE, South Carolina--The last Republican presidential candidate to visit Bob Jones University was George W. Bush. It was a fiasco. When Bush visited in 2000, the Greenville, South Carolina, school was known for two things: its strict rules on music, film, shopping, and dress, and its ban on interracial dating. And although Bush was there to tout and affirm his ties to conservative evangelicals, the focus--in the press and elsewhere--was on race. ""I didn't want it hanging around our neck up here in New York that the presidential candidate of my party consorts with and condones the bigoted policy of Bob Jones University,"" said Rep. Peter King to the Washington Post, in that brief moment where some Republicans didn't want Bush to be president. ""It's going to be a problem and we're not going to be able shake ourselves loose of it unless we shake ourselves loose of George Bush."" Bush survived the controversy, and Bob Jones changed course--that year, it lifted its ban on interracial relationships. But the damage was done. Bush focused on evangelical voters in his 2004 re-election race but didn't touch the university. Mike Huckabee bypassed the school in his 2008 effort to rouse evangelicals and win the GOP nomination, and Mitt Romney ignored it in his 2012 campaign for the GOP nomination. Which makes this past weekend a noteworthy moment in the history of presidential elections. For the first time since Bush, a Republican visited Bob Jones University for a campaign event. In fact, two Republicans visited. On Friday, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson joined South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott for a town hall. And greeted by a packed auditorium of fans and onlookers, Carson held forth on policy and faith. ""I believe in a loving God who is compassionate. And I believe in godly principals of loving your fellow man ... having values and principals that govern your life. That will obviously impact the way that I feel about things,"" he said. I wasn't there for Carson's event. But I did attend the other Republican candidate's visit--Sen. Ted Cruz. There, the Texas senator, who is on the upswing in the Republican presidential race, held a rally under the banner of religious liberty. And every aspect of the production was designed to emphasize Cruz's presentation as a warrior for conservative evangelical Christians. The program described the senator as ""the consistent conservative defending religious liberty,"" and the rally itself was explicitly religious in form and content, resembling nothing as much as an exurban megachurch service. The preshow, for example, was a series of choir performances: one from a nearby school (North Greenville University), one from Crown College in Tennessee, and one from Bob Jones itself. Once the modest crowd was seated in the auditorium--according to the campaign, 2,500 people attended the event, compared with double as many for Carson's the day earlier--Cruz asked for a moment of silence for the victims of the terrorist attack in Paris, and--in an opening prayer--called for a response to the ISIS militants who claimed responsibility. ""This is an evil that will not quietly slip away,"" Cruz said. ""We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism. This evil wll no longer walk the face of the Earth."" From there, we had the show. Former Major League Baseball players and erstwhile HGTV stars David and Jason Benham were the MCs. Their story, of losing a home improvement show after a liberal group aired their views on same-sex marriage, was a cautionary tale of a secular society gone mad against conservative Christians. In turn, they introduced a series of speakers, either live or in highly produced videos: former Virginia lieutenant governor nominee E.W. Jackson, who won huge applause with his opening line, ""I am not an African-American; I am an American""; Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council; and Kelly Shackelford of the Liberty Institute. Cruz also hosted several ""heroes"" of religious liberty, including one couple who were sued for declining to host a same-sex wedding ceremony in a historic chapel they owned. As for the senator himself? He hit familiar notes. ""The federal government wages a daily assault on life, on marriage, on religious liberty. It's because Christians are not standing up for our values,"" said Cruz. He accused Obama of ""particular antipathy"" for Christians and described a United States where Christianity was practically on the run. ""What kind of country have we become when kneeling in prayer is regarded as an act of civil disobedience?"" he asked. ""These threats are real, and they are growing each and every day."" To liberal ears, this might sound hyperbolic. But it resonated with the audience, who see real prejudice against Christians in present-day American life. ""I'm here to support other Christians and Ted Cruz as well,"" said one attendee, who called himself a ""Christian conservative."" Another audience member, Julius, came to Bob Jones from Atlanta. ""I've been a Ted Cruz fan for a long time, he's my choice for president,"" he said. ""He shares my values from a faith aspect."" Others pointed to the senator's stances on public morality. ""I like his stance on abortion, keeping 'Under God' in the pledge, defunding Planned Parenthood, and defending our traditional values,"" said Seth, who came to the event from Columbia, South Carolina. This is all to say that Cruz wasn't there to persuade anyone. This was an audience of supporters--people who, if they vote in the South Carolina primary, will vote for the Texas senator. Instead, Cruz had come to affirm, as loudly as possible, his position as the evangelical candidate who can win. He understands their issues, speaks to their problems, and aggressively courts their leaders; part of the Cruz campaign strategy is to recruit pastors in every county of Iowa and South Carolina and to rely on grassroots evangelical support to win the ""SEC primary"" on Super Tuesday next year. Which raises a question: Is this strategy working? Cruz is trailing in the polls behind Donald Trump and Ben Carson--the absolute leaders in the Republican race for president--but he's nearly even with Sen. Marco Rubio. And in South Carolina and Iowa, he's moving closer and closer to the top. It's still impossible to say what will happen in the GOP primary, but we can say--with certainty--that Cruz is someone to watch. See more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."
