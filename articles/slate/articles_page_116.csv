We're at the annual convention of celebrity impersonators in a conference room at the Imperial Palace, not one of the Strip's more glamorous addresses. Beside us is a short guy with a blond-mullet hair weave who's trying to scowl like Dog the Bounty Hunter. A Britney Spears runs by searching for her lost riding crop. ""I see this as a chance to grow as a dramatic actor,"" says Butler, who prepares for each Obama show by affixing fake hair to his otherwise bald head. ""Besides, it can be very lucrative."" Butler is a professional actor with a full-time job playing Oscar on ""True Jackson, VP"" on Nickelodeon. Now he is trying to break into a more specialized field. Top-tier presidential impersonators make appearances at conventions, corporate meetings, and the like. And the battle to become First Impersonator is real. As is the money he stands to make. Tim Watters, the world's greatest Bill Clinton impersonator, has grossed more than $1 million in a single year and owns six boats and two beach houses. But just as every politician can't be a Bill Clinton, so every presidential impersonator can't be a Tim Watters. ""There's A-list talent, and there's D-list talent,"" says Janna Joos, an agent who represents more than 2,000 impersonators and organizes the Las Vegas conference. ""You can tell the difference instantly."" Presidential impersonation is a subsidiary of the larger industry of celebrity impersonation, which is worth millions annually. (Exact figures are hard to come by.) Yes, the field has its freaks--at the conference in May, I talked for an hour to a Kenny Rogers impersonator who refused to tell me his real name or use his own voice--but I also met some pretty rational (and savvy) entrepreneurs. ""We take it seriously because this is our living,"" says Rob Garrett, a Neil Diamond impersonator who calls himself ""The King of Diamonds."" ""Some months I might only play two gigs and still I pay my bills."" Among the world of celebrity impersonators, however, fake presidents stand apart. For one thing, their careers--like the presidents they impersonate--are term-limited. There are no George H.W. Bush impersonators working full-time anymore. The last good Reagan died recently. The former agent for one of the only Jimmy Carter look-alikes in the country says his client has either retired or moved. On the other hand, the industry is big enough to support still-current presidential runners-up. There are at least four Dick Cheneys, a John McCain, a bevy of non-SNL Sarah Palins, and a man named Frank King, who promotes ""clean corporate comedy"" and has his own Joe Biden act. Presidential impersonators also are different because, to be blunt, they have to be better than other impersonators. ""Presidential impersonators tend to be the best overall talent,"" says Brent Mendenhall, a top George W. Bush look-alike and an agent to other impersonators. ""They get the most work and make the most money."" That's because impersonating the president is really hard. Most stars are surprisingly fungible--you'd be amazed how far a Marilyn can go with a blond wig and a push-up bra. Presidents are different. Barack Obama's face, with his cinched-together eyebrows and wide-open smile, is among the most recognizable in the world. His voice and manner of speech--those pregnant pauses between words, when you can almost see those giant gears grinding inside his head--are universally familiar. ""Everybody knows exactly how Obama looks and acts,"" says Butler. ""I have to study his complete physicality."" And he has to be a quick study, because time is short. Throughout George W. Bush's administration, Mendenhall worked full-time, earning more than $100,000 a year. Eight months after Bush left office, Mendenhall's gravy train has all but stopped. ""I might have to find another job,"" he concedes. Work also plummeted after Obama's election for John Morgan, a Bush impersonator, and for Dale Leigh, a Bill Clinton look-alike. So they created a new act: ""Bill & George's Excellent Adventure."" ""Hopefully it will have demand in the marketplace,"" Morgan says, ""so we can keep doing this full-time."" All of which explains why competition among Obama impersonators is particularly fierce right now. Talent agents will book the various Obamas on the basis of looks, performance, and professionalism. A-list Obamas can charge up to $13,000 to emcee a trade convention, make an appearance at a corporate meeting, or hand out awards at an employee-appreciation event. The typical performance includes a half-hour speech mixing topical, family-friendly, bipartisan political humor with inside jokes at middle management's expense. Afterward, impersonators work the room, posing for photos with managers and the CEO. Lucky performers might get to star in a Japanese TV commercial. C-listers, in contrast, work the parade-and-wedding circuit. They might make $500 a day. ""We're in the proving time right now, and the cream will rise to the top,"" says Randall West, an Obama impersonator and formerly the owner of a Ford dealership in New Jersey. ""Who's gonna be the man? I think I'm gonna be the man."" According to talent agents, West and Butler are the top competitors for the coveted title of First Impersonator. ""Most of these other guys aren't in the same league,"" says Greg Thompson, an agent in Orlando. Butler scores high marks for looks, act, and professionalism. But his TV work makes scheduling a problem, says Thompson. West is more committed to Obama as a full-time career. His problem is the impersonation itself. West's smile is wide-open and constant, giving him all of the president's gregariousness but none of his reserve. Normally enthusiasm is good in an impersonation, says Thompson. ""But for Obama, it's tricky."" Like political rivals, these impersonators are not averse to a little negative campaigning. ""Have you met Ron?"" West asked me. ""He has no hair! And he's short. I'm a half-inch taller than Obama. When people get a load of me, I mean, Wow!"" As West's agent, Mendenhall schools his protege on the craft's finer points. To add drama before making a grand entrance, some performers send German shepherds into crowded halls to impersonate bomb-sniffing dogs. True professionals buy their own springy earphones and get volunteers to mimic Secret Service agents. And all the best presidential impersonators tell the same story, about the first day a stranger walked up and asked, ""Do you know who you look like?"" The ones who make it learn that to impersonate a president, a good business plan trumps a perfect face. ""I keep telling Randall to focus on his marketing and promotion,"" Mendenhall says. ""People need to remember that this is a serious business."""	Inside the wacky but lucrative world of presidential impersonators.

Last week, when the White House increased its 10-year deficit projection by $2 trillion, some members of the GOP shifted from discussing the threat Obama's health reforms pose to the elderly to warning of the dangers his spending poses to the young. ""We must proceed with extreme caution before putting in place a huge and costly new program that will threaten our economy and the future of our children,""said Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire. House Minority Leader John Boehner greeted the news with an equally protective sentiment: ""The Democrats' out-of-control spending binge is burying our children and grandchildren under a mountain of unsustainable debt."" Such worries have an honorable political lineage. What kind of policymaker could be against children? Sure, it's all well and good to debate the size and meaning of the federal debt. But can anyone seriously question that we are imposing an ever-increasing and unfair burden on the children who might be ill-equipped to bear the cost? Well, yes. There is a good, simple reason for taking a more selfish view of the cost our present debt imposes on future Americans: All else being equal, those future Americans will be leading better, easier, richer lives. So just as there are good arguments for imposing costs on the present-day rich for the benefit of the present-day poor, there are good arguments for imposing costs on America's wealthy future for the sake of its relatively impoverished present. The main reason that the future should be better off is staring at you from the light-emitting diodes in the back of your screen: improvements in technology. Markets crash and deficits rise, but through it all, improving technology has continued to tempt us with an ever-expanding array of consumption options. Even if the value of your house has declined, the number of things you can do on your phone probably hasn't. Nor are the benefits of increased productivity limited to personal technology. One example: It is far easier to find information, organize it appropriately and send it all to a colleague (or an editor) than it was five or 10 or 20 years ago. Over the past 60 years, the country's private-sector ""multifactor productivity""--which measures output based on a combination of inputs (like labor and capital) and is our closest measure of the impact of technology on productivity--has increased at an average rate of 1.4 percent annually. Even during the most unproductive stretch in recent American history, between 1973 and '90, multifactor productivity still increased (by 0.6 percent annually). This is not to say that the gains of additional technology are always distributed evenly. But improvements in technology do increase the size of the pie. Technological improvements decrease the amount of time it takes to accomplish tasks and leave open additional hours to earn more income or enjoy more leisure. And even if you believe that many of these innovations are also powerful tools of procrastination--and I do--at least appreciate that you have more time to fritter away. Still, the question lingers: Is it possible that more debt will result in less innovation? There is little reason to expect it to. It's certainly true that the pace of technological improvement is affected by other variables in the economy, and it's vaguely plausible to imagine that one such factor might be the size of the national debt. (The argument would go like this: Today's debt is tomorrow's tax--someone's got to pay for it, after all--and one effect of higher taxes might be a reduced incentive, or less capital, to invent fabulous new technologies.) But the relationship between technological improvement and other economic variables is not well-understood (in the most common long-run growth model it is an ""exogenous"" variable--determined by forces outside the model). And there is no evidence that debt and taxes have had a particularly profound impact on American innovation. Some of the greatest years for technological improvement in the 20th century--the late 1940s and early '50s--were years of debt and taxes high enough to make John Boehner run for cover under the budget estimates of today. And even if technology improves less rapidly in the future, it's hard to imagine our level of technology actually falling. There are some quirky historical examples of societies actually losing expertise--the disappearance of gunsmithing in ancient Japan, perhaps, or the accumulated wisdom of the Roman Empire. But it is rare. The level of technology in the economy isn't the physical accumulation of vehicles and factories and tools, which wear out after extended use. And it's not like the size of the labor force, the growth of which waxes and wanes from generation to generation. It's the knowledge of how to squeeze more stuff out of less time. The technological wizardry for building an iPhone or an intercontinental ballistic missile cannot be easily whisked away by the sands of history. Is that past performance indicative of future success? Perhaps not. Perhaps we could find ourselves in a dystopian second dark age, in which the previously expanding chain of shared human knowledge is severed. This is the basis for many fine science fiction novels. But if a benighted dystopia is in our future, our children have an awful lot more to worry about than the national debt."	Don't worry about burdening our children with a huge national debt.

Mitch McConnell at a health care town hall in Kansas City today, ""... than the suggestion that America does not already have the finest health care in the world."" Sen. John McCain, appearing alongside him, agreed: ""The quality of health care in America is the best in the world."" Contrast that with what health care journalist T.R. Reid writes in his new book comparing various global health care systems: ""Today, any U.S. politician who dared to make that claim ... would be hooted out of the room."" Reid clearly has yet to visit Kansas City. At the hourlong forum this morning, McConnell and McCain laid out the GOP's closing arguments against health care reform and showed why the chances of health care bipartisanship are fast approaching zilch. The first problem is that Republicans and Democrats can't even agree there's a problem. McCain and McConnell say we're No. 1 in health care, while Democrats agree with the World Health Organization that we're more like No. 37. Democrats say there are 47 million uninsured Americans. McCain and McConnell, meanwhile, are skeptical. ""I don't question that number in summary,"" McCain said, ""but I think when you break it down it gets more interesting."" For example, he said, 5 million are college students, 9 million are people making $75,000 a year or more, 10 million are noncitizens, 11 million are eligible for Medicaid or S-CHIP but haven't enrolled. ""So really, we're talking about 12 to 15 million who are uninsured today."" McCain and McConnell also questioned the Democrats' plans for an ambitious government overhaul of health care, emphasizing ""incremental reform"" instead. ""Let's tackle this with precision,"" said McConnell, ""rather than massive overreach."" What would those precise, targeted policies be? McCain talked about wellness and fitness, outcome-based treatment (i.e., doing what works), and eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse--all components of the Democrats' health care plan. McCain also mentioned tort reform, which he estimated would save $100 billion a year. But he and McConnell drew the line at creating a ""massive, audacious"" government-run system. Who's right? Again, depends whom you ask--or, rather, when you ask. As McCain pointed out during the town hall, the Congressional Budget Office said in July that the House version of the health care bill would add to the deficit during the next 10 years--not reduce it. Another CBO estimate, also in July, said that a public option alone would net $150 billion over 10 years. The CBO has yet to score the cooperative model being hammered out by the Senate finance committee. Even if Republicans and Democrats did agree on the solution, they don't agree on how to pay for it. McCain and McConnell repeatedly stated that the Obama plan would be paid for on the back of small businesses. By this, they mean that raising taxes on the top bracket, as Democrats have proposed, would hurt small-business owners who pay business taxes as personal income tax. But the House legislation carves out an exemption for small businesses, and Obama has argued that reform would help small businesses by offering plans with lower rates. McCain reminded the audience of his campaign proposal to pay for reform by capping the employer tax exclusion--that is, requiring that health care benefits received through your employer be taxed just like benefits you buy on your own. This, the CBO recently said, would save about $250 billion, which could help pay for reform. Politically, though, taxing employer benefits would never fly. Unions would object, businesses would start dropping coverage, and Obama would indirectly break his promise that ""if you like your plan, you can keep it."" As closing arguments go, ""It's too expensive"" is pretty strong for the Republicans. It capitalizes on anxieties about the spending explosion of Obama's first seven months: McCain rattled off the costs of the stimulus bill, TARP, the budget, the auto bailout. It prevents the party from having to provide concrete alternatives to the Democrats' plan. (""Do less"" is easier than ""Do this instead."") And it returns the GOP to its small-government roots--never a bad thing, post-Bush. This approach all but precludes bipartisanship. If they can't agree on the health care problem, how to fix it, or how to fund it, that doesn't leave much room for common ground. In a Sunday New York Times op-ed, Bill Bradley argued that a bipartisan compromise is ""obvious: Combine universal coverage with malpractice tort reform in health care."" He, too, has yet to visit Kansas City."	John McCain and Mitch McConnell show why bipartisanship on health care is impossible.

Is there a building, bridge, or international airport in or around Washington just waiting for the senator's name to be etched onto it? There's no shortage of unnamed federal buildings. The General Services Administration, which manages federal property, oversees 96 million square feet of space in Washington alone. But a lot of the real estate still up for grabs houses the sorts of agencies you may not want your dearly departed to be associated with. The new headquarters of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, for example, doesn't have a name. Neither does the Department of the Interior. Given Kennedy's devotion to health care reform, maybe it would be appropriate to get his name inscribed on the Department of Health and Human Services building. Unfortunately, HHS HQ was nabbed in 1977 by Hubert Humphrey, a former senator and vice president. But a little farther from the Capitol, the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., is nameless. (Several of its buildings or auditoriums are named for people, but the campus itself is creatively referred to as ""the campus."") And the Food and Drug Administration is moving to new headquarters at the White Oak Research Center in Maryland, which will be home to several huge, as-yet-unnamed buildings. Naming a federal building literally requires an act of Congress. If the House, Senate, and president approve a proposed name change, the GSA takes over. Its officials confer with the people actually using the building, and together they come up with a plan for new signs inside and out. Before any chisel hits granite, the plans have to be approved by the National Capitol Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts. For the feds, there's a distinction between naming a building after someone and making a building a memorial to someone. The Kennedy Center, with its bust of JFK in the Grand Foyer, is technically a memorial to the former president. The Ronald Reagan Building, with the Gipper's name on the outside but not much else, is not. If a naming is part of a hybrid memorial/building like the Kennedy Center, the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission will be involved in the name change as well. Despite the layers of bureaucracy, the process is generally smooth. Most proposed name changes are approved by huge majorities in Congress, and the GSA, the NCPC, and the CFA all get along fairly well. Tempers can flare, however, when name changes are attempted in honor of highly partisan figures. Republican success in renaming Washington's airport for Ronald Reagan--not a beloved figure in the air-traffic controllers' union--caused some heartburn among Democrats 11  years ago. (Kennedy voted in favor of the change.) But with a Democratic Congress and president, the senator's supporters shouldn't have much trouble getting something named in his honor. And even if Congress can't agree on a building that's worthy of the late statesman, they can always take the advice of Rush Limbaugh--and Sen. Robert Byrd--and put his name on the health care reform bill."	Does Washington have anything just waiting to be named after Ted Kennedy?
4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/08/baracks_book_bag.html	"All vacations have their rituals: slapping sunscreen on wriggling kids, eating ice cream after dinner, and hiding the holes in the rental-house drywall. Presidential vacations have rituals, too: peekaboo with the press corps, highly managed casual social engagements, and golf. Always there must be the golf. Even the news media have their vacation rituals. One of them is overinterpreting the presidential summer reading list. Monday the White House obliged, offering the list of five books president Obama has packed for his trip: * The Way Home by George Pelecanos, a crime thriller based in Washington, D.C.; * Lush Life by Richard Price, a story of race and class set in New York's Lower East Side; * Tom Friedman's  Hot, Flat, and Crowded, on the benefits to America of an environmental revolution; * John Adams by David McCullough; *  Plainsong by Kent Haruf, a drama about the life of eight different characters living in a Colorado prairie community. What does this list of American authors tell us about the president? Well, it's not as fun as the year Bush decided to read Camus'  The Stranger. George Bush reading a French Existentialist is like Obama reading a Cabela's catalog. Plus, it was a story about a one-time layabout turned unrepentant Arab killer, which, if you wanted to overinterpret things, gave you enough material to get you through a few packs of Gauloises. The Obama selection is not overtly controversial. In 2006, Bush's list included  The Great Influenza, about the 1918 flu. If Obama were reading that today while his White House was issuing a new report about the H1N1 virus, he'd start a national panic. But his list is also clearly not poll-tested. Women played a key role in Obama's victory in 2008. They're swing voters. And yet all of Obama's authors are white men. The subject of the longest book, John Adams, is a dead white male. Obama couldn't get away with that in an election year, and, given his aides' penchant for cleaning up little things like this, we'll soon see the president with a copy of Kate Walbert's  A Short History of Women. The Price and Pelecanos books are very similar--urban, East Coast crime stories by two authors who have also written for the HBO series  The Wire. Only the Haruf provides geographical and literary diversity. The McCullough book seems like the kind of thing presidents get with the job. When presidents read presidential biographies, it must be like a user's manual for the office. Sure, Adams occupied it 200 years ago, but just as Obama read  Team of Rivals when picking his Cabinet and Jonathan Alter's  The Defining Moment on FDR's 100 days when forming his initial agenda, he'll probably now start dropping Adams references in the coming months. I bet Obama doesn't finish the Friedman. There's no book on his list more like his evening briefing books. And he's going to have to sacrifice something. The books total nearly 2,400 pages. At an average speed of one page per minute, the president needs to spend at least four hours a day reading. Plus, he's still got briefings and work reading he's got to do, and Sen. Baucus might be calling on Line 2. The president can't do all that and spend time with his daughters, play golf and tennis as he did Monday, and enjoy a few of those three-hour dinners with his wife. And if he can do all of that, why hasn't he passed health care reform twice by now? (Of course, the marathon reading could be training for the 1,000-page health care bill he might be lucky enough to read one day.) That said, the Obama list is nowhere near as ambitious as the stack Bill Clinton used to take with him to the Vineyard. The 42nd president usually took at least a dozen books, ranging from history to biography to mysteries. When Clinton visited Edgartown Books on the island a few years ago to sign copies of his autobiography, he walked the aisles pointing to books, saying, ""Read that, read that, read that,"" according to Susan Mercier, the manager. When Clinton vacationed at the Vineyard during his presidency, bookstores sent baskets of books in a public competition for his affections. This year, Edgartown Books sent President Obama a small collection:  That Old Cape Magic by Richard Russo for the president, Linda Fairstein's  Lethal Legacy for the first lady, and  A Child's Guide to Martha's Vineyard for the girls. The books were delivered through a Clinton acquaintance (there are a lot of those on the Vineyard these days), but there's no word on whether the president has seen the delivery. Over at Bunch of Grapes, a bookstore in Vineyard Haven, the new owner is playing it coy. A clerk acknowledged that they had sent books, but when asked which ones, she sounded as if she were on the press office payroll. ""Nothing [we] can share with anyone,"" she said. Another store employee says there are rumors Obama might visit, which means management is probably wise to be so fussy with information. Barnes & Noble, meanwhile, certain not to get a visit, has already tried to capitalize on the Obama reading list. We can blame John Kennedy for this obsession with presidential reading. Asked at a press conference what he read for relaxation, he named Ian Fleming's James Bond novels. Kennedy was the first glamour president of the television age. His celebrity status escalated the process of overinterpreting presidential behavior, but those books also seemed to say something about the man who read them. It was just too fitting that Kennedy was reading about a debonair Cold War rake who made his own rules. Presidential reading lists have been squeezed for meaning ever since. Which means that in the heat of this year's health care debate, the president doesn't dare read anything by anyone who once wrote a book called Dr. No. Slate V: POTUS as House Guest: A Short History"	What President Obama's summer reading list says about him.
5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/08/the_rielle_world.html	"The National Enquirer is reporting what everyone already knew--that John Edwards is in fact the father of Rielle Hunter's child--and a North Carolina TV station says he may admit paternity. This news has been met largely with shrugs. Edwards is not only a failed candidate, he is a failed politician, with next to no influence among Democrats. Still, the news raises two tantalizing hypothetical questions: What if Edwards had won the Democratic nomination? What if he had won the presidency? First question first. It's easy to forget how close John Edwards came to being the Democratic nominee. When Edwards entered the presidential race in December 2006, many people saw him as the Democrats' best hope. Unlike Obama, he had legislative experience. Unlike Hillary, he'd spent two years touring Iowa and beefing up his populist credentials. And no one blamed him for Kerry's loss in 2004. He was smart, good-looking, and Southern--just like every Democratic president since Johnson. So what would the primary have looked like? Let's pretend, since we're making all this up anyway, that Obama had decided not to enter the race--he had heeded the ""wait your turn"" argument many Democrats were making. Edwards would likely have sucked up all the energy and talent that instead ended up joining Obama. David Axelrod had worked for Edwards in 2004, and David Plouffe had worked for Axelrod. (Axelrod had also worked with Hillary on epilepsy advocacy but never as a candidate.) Edwards' themes might even have been ""Hope"" and ""Change."" Meanwhile, the big endorsements for Obama--Ted Kennedy, Bill Richardson, not to mention major unions like the SEIU and Teamsters--would likely have gone to the relatively progressive Edwards. Edwards' fundraising might not have matched the Obama machine, but he certainly would have been able to harness the power of small donations over the Web to match or out-raise Hillary. Then there's the electoral map. An Edwards-Clinton face-off would probably have looked a lot like Obama-Clinton. Edwards would have won Iowa. Clinton might have taken New Hampshire, as she did in 2008. Nevada would have been a split, but Edwards would have swept South Carolina. (He won 26 percent anyway.) That would have left everything to Feb. 5, after which, if the race was still close, they would have battled for delegates. Edwards would probably have nailed the caucuses, as Obama did. But Hispanics and African-Americans might easily have swung to Hillary. Needless to say, the odds of candidate Edwards becoming nominee Edwards would have been good. OK, so he made it through the primaries. What then? Like Obama, Edwards would have shifted to the center--embracing Israel, hedging on FISA, and distancing himself from the netroots to which he owed his resurgence. As far as the scandal, timing would have been everything. It's easy to say that if Edwards had won the Democratic nomination, news of his affair--which emerged in late July 2008--would have torpedoed his campaign. But that may be too simple. If Edwards were the nominee, he likely would have behaved differently. He probably wouldn't have met Rielle Hunter at the Beverly Hilton on July 21, for example. He probably would have cut off all communication whatsoever with Hunter. Hush money would have flowed. Former confidante Andrew Young, whose forthcoming tell-all memoir promises to deal Edwards yet another blow, would be the best-paid man on the planet. Sure, details of the scandal would have trickled out. It's just impossible to say when or to what extent. Without the incriminating photos in the Enquirer, it would have been easy to tamp down, Clinton-style. Democrats would have refused to believe it; to do so would have been partywide suicide. At the same time, Republican opposition researchers would have sunk half their budget into digging up dirt. (Unlike Obama's relationships with Bill Ayers and Jeremiah Wright, an Edwards love affair would have qualified as a bona fide scandal.) And if reporters with their shoestring budgets and multiple beats were able to gather juicy tidbits, GOP operatives definitely would have found something. Say they had: It's still a fair question whether John McCain would have used it. In 2008, McCain refused to mention Jeremiah Wright in his campaign ads, despite a staff eager to do so. There's a good chance he would have left Hunter alone, too, especially considering his own marital history. But McCain wouldn't have needed to say anything. The lies would have spoken for themselves. Edwards' moralizing and trotting out of family would have in retrospect looked hypocritical. McCain's ""straight talk"" would have seemed all the more appealing. Even if Democrats stayed loyal, Edwards would have lost independents. It's safe to assume that if Edwards had won the nomination, McCain would be president. It's hard to overstate the ripple effect on American politics, especially the Democratic Party. Democrats would have blown their best shot at the presidency in a generation. Every bit of joy and enthusiasm and relief that spilled out after Obama's victory--imagine the opposite. Despair. Disillusionment. Recriminations would be shouted, scapegoats slaughtered. Liberals in their fury might even embrace McCain, who would suddenly realize he doesn't have to tack so far right to win. Edwards would become a curse word. Some former Edwards staffers have claimed that they had planned to sabotage the campaign if their candidate was on the verge of winning the nomination. But that's easy to say in hindsight. If Edwards had been about to beat Hillary and, with the hopes and dreams of half the country behind him, take the presidency, it would have been insane to pull the plug. No cost/benefit analysis would have counseled it. Could Edwards have won? Possibly. If, somehow, the news had never leaked. If Rielle Hunter had been bought off or mysteriously disappeared. If the McCain campaign somehow botched the oppo. So let's say--again, because we can!--that he did win and this news emerged after his victory. This would have been a disaster of a different sort. The scandal would have overshadowed his first-term agenda. His poll numbers would have dropped so low as to render him impotent. His credibility--so necessary in debates like health care reform--would be nonexistent. Resignation might be the only solution, leaving us with a President Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden or Chris Dodd. Yes, staying in office while in disgrace is possible. And it could even have odd, Lifetime- movielike silver linings. It would have changed the way we look at marriage: Imagine he reconciled publicly with Rielle and invited her to the White House. Or if Elizabeth left him--the first presidential divorce. Either way, presidential politics would have descended into soap opera. As for the more likely scenarios of Edwards becoming vice president or attorney general, those narratives would have played out relatively simply: appointment, revelation, resignation. The only difference would be that these alternate histories--the possibility that this man could have led the country--would have hit even closer to home. Of course, it's impossible to say any of these things would have happened. Chaos theory, butterfly effect, etc. A political landscape without Obama would have produced a whole different set of issues, debates, gaffes, stories, and nonstories. But of the infinite number of possible outcomes of the 2008 election, a remarkable number of them involve John Edwards."	What if John Edwards had won the Democratic nomination? What if he were president?
6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/08/aim_low.html	"When Gov. Mark Sanford's political future imploded in June, he let down an important constituency. Never mind the people of South Carolina: The Republican Governors Association, of which Sanford was chairman, had to scramble--and within an hour it had announced that Haley Barbour, governor of Mississippi and pol-about-town, would take Sanford's place. Barbour, as so often for the Republican Party, was pleased to serve. Now speculation has already begun over whether Barbour will run for president in 2012. (It's hard to tell whether these reports stem from pundits desperate for a column or Republicans desperate for leader.) Regardless of whether this speculation is accurate--and Barbour isn't exactly batting it down--it's not quite right. The place for Barbour on the GOP's 2012 ticket is the bottom, not the top. Barbour is the GOP's Mr. Fix-It. Sixteen years ago, when the party was in a similar position--booted out of the White House, out of money, and ideologically incoherent--he was elected to run the Republican National Committee, promising strong executive leadership to rebuild the party. In his first two years, he bailed out the nearly bankrupt National Republican Campaign Committee while cajoling, strategizing, fundraising, and bullying fractious Republicans back into the majority. Newt Gingrich was the bullhorn of the 1994 Republican revolution, but Barbour was the guy who paid for the bullhorn. The 61-year-old Barbour has had many incarnations: director of the Mississippi census at the age of 22, lawyer in the family law practice, failed Senate candidate, Reagan White House official. Now, after a successful lobbying stint at the BGR Group--started as Barbour, Griffith, and Rogers--and with a respected record as governor, Barbour is back on the Hill. He testifies on cap-and-trade legislation and chats about Russia with Sean Hannity. He rides the airwaves slamming the Obama administration's spending habits, casting them exactly as he did the Clinton economic package in 1993--Obama, like Clinton, could ""charm the skin off a snake."" All of which prompts conservatives to cry, Haley's comet is streaking! He's a strong voice in a leaderless party, and as leading 2012 contenders self-destruct, flirt with fringe theories, and attack one another, there sits Mr. Fix-It, now a successful elected executive, conveniently term-limited in 2011. Even opponents are impressed, or at least they say they are. ""He's an unusual combination of someone who's really good on policy, really good on politics, and really good on TV,"" says Democratic lobbyist Anthony Podesta. ""And everybody likes him."" Here's the problem. Over three decades in politics, Barbour may have accumulated too much baggage to withstand the scrutiny of a presidential campaign. Besides, he is way too good a vice presidential candidate to waste at the top of the ticket. The baggage can be described by two simple words on a piece of campaign literature: tobacco lobbyist. (This story does that one better and refers to him as ""a millionaire tobacco lobbyist."") In 1997, Barbour helped five companies negotiate their $368.5 billion settlement with the state attorneys general--and slipped a $50 billion tax credit into a comprehensive tobacco bill, which was later rescinded when legislators found out. If anyone in American politics could talk his way out of this, it's Barbour: He was just fighting for the hard-working American tobacco farmer, keeping the government from meddling in American business, etc. But it's unlikely. The public now rates cigarette companies down with the financial services industry as the two most-hated demons of corporate America. And the list goes on. In the late 1990s, he raised millions of dollars for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, later disgraced. He represented Mexico in the negotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which wouldn't go over so well with the GOP base. While at the RNC, he funneled $2.1 million to the group through dubious channels from a Hong Kong tycoon. These are things that, when brought up by the opposition repeatedly over a year and a half, start to weigh a presidential candidate down. In a running mate, they're more forgivable. Now, there are few hard-and-fast criteria for what vice presidents should look like. Conventional wisdom holds that their desirable qualities are almost entirely relative, determined by weaknesses of the nominee, balancing traits like age, gender, and geography. On that score, you can count on Barbour to pull in the ""bubba vote"": Southerners dubious about Obama's spending, as well as other stuff about Obama. Whoever the nominee is, Barbour's comfort on-camera plus a real ability to connect with voters makes him an excellent presidential emissary--no Palin-esque disasters here--who could easily handle Joe Biden in a debate. But wait: There's more! As historian Allan Lichtman notes, the best running mate is also the ablest leader for the party, to carry the banner when the president's term is up. By that metric, Ronald Reagan picked well with a nominal Southerner and former RNC chair, George H.W. Bush, who in turn helped tank his own re-election chances by sticking with the green and bumbling Dan Quayle. Barbour comes out well on this score. His leadership after Hurricane Katrina impressed Governing magazine enough to name him public official of the year in 2006, and he was re-elected by a healthy 58 percent in 2007. A Presbyterian deacon and Sunday school teacher, Barbour has genuine social-conservative credentials, but he has argued that the party shouldn't rip itself apart over issues like abortion and gay marriage. Presiding over the Senate is the vice president's only formal duty; if his ability to corral politicos into a simple and consistent message counts for anything, he'd at least discharge that responsibility with ease. ""Plus, he is extraordinarily smart on policy issues,"" says Republican rainmaker Fred Malek. Put him in charge of whatever. And then there's perhaps the most important criterion: money. What makes Barbour an improbable presidential candidate--a history of raising millions of dollars for clients and candidates--also makes him a huge asset to the presidential ticket, along with an excellent sense of where to spend it. He helped retake the House in 1994 by focusing the party on its ground game in the states. Could he do so again from the sidelines? Sure, but there's no motivation like having your own name on the ballot (and he's already got a constituency!). Finally there's the intangibles, as they call them on ESPN. As the party's vice presidential candidate, Barbour could travel the country raising money, attending picnics, and easing tensions in the fractious GOP. And he would also make the choice for the top of the ticket a lot easier. Barbour would need someone Northern to run under, preferably one with business credentials--Mitt Romney isn't looking too bad lately. Even Gov. Tim Pawlenty, not yet scarred by scandal, could be the fresh face to Barbour's grizzled experience. Whoever the choice is, with Haley Barbour as his (or her?) running mate, the Republican presidential candidate will have one less thing to worry about."	Why Haley Barbour is the GOP's leading candidate in 2012--for vice president.
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/07/slow_down_mr_president.html	"We're behind you, Barack, but slow down. That was the message from a dozen independent voters who chatted with veteran pollster Peter Hart Wednesday night. Hart, who regularly conducts these focus groups for the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, had expected a harsher assessment. He'd just finished working on the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll in which President Obama's approval rating is at 53 percent. The Pew poll and New York Times/CBS poll have shown similar drops. When people are asked about the president's performance on the issue of the day--health care--their assessments are even grimmer. In the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, 42 percent now say that the president's plan is a bad idea, which is a 10-point increase since last month. I sat on the other side of one-way glass with a group of other reporters while Hart started his work, a mixture of cajoling and entertaining the participants for their real views. It started out darkly for Obama. Asked to rate the current state of things between zero (miserable) and 10 (great), two picked 5, and everyone else went lower. Asked to give a word or phrase describing how they felt about the country, they said: struggling, stagnant, disgruntled, nothing's changed, dismal, worried, hell in a handbasket, drained. Hart pointed to an easel with a series of arrows on it. Some pointed straight up. Some pointed slightly up. Another zigzagged. He asked the group to pick which one represented where the country would be in two years. Almost everyone picked the zigzag. Lou Moriconi, a 63-year-old graphic designer, picked an arrow pointing straight down, the harshest assessment. But when asked what he would tell the president if he met him, he said: ""Keep up the good work--we're still behind you."" Lou was one of the seven in the group who voted for Obama (or ""Barack,"" as six of his supporters referred to him), but even the four McCain voters and one Nader supporter had not given up on the president. ""Stay strong,"" said Ray, a movie theater manager, when asked what he would tell Obama. Each could remember what they felt the night Obama was elected. Their recollections were vivid. One woman who voted for McCain, Jennifer Pennington, nevertheless remembers crying at the sense of possibility. ""I pledged all my hopes for him."" This kind of intense emotion could lead to a sense of dashed expectations, but instead it appears to have created, at least in this small sample, a personal connection that makes them patient and ready to follow. When Scott Wood, an unemployed network administrator was asked what he would tell Obama he said, ""Don't give up. We haven't."" ""We've found out he's not Superman,"" said Obama voter Nora Seeley, 54, a dental hygienist, when asked what she had learned about him in the last six months. ""He's on a fast train,"" said Seeley. ""Things aren't being considered."" Nearly everyone echoed this sentiment. ""Slow down,"" said Alex Chambers, a 27-year-old teacher, when asked to give the president advice. ""The speed that he's doing things--it's a little bit of a gamble,"" said Tim Polen, a 24-year-old student. Many worried that by moving too quickly--particularly on health care--Obama was going to make the situation worse. There were lots of concerns expressed on everything from the growth of spending to the Wall Street bailouts. But speed was the big issue. ""People just need to breathe,"" said Hart. ""It's like trying to shove a meal down in a minute. These people are saying, 'Slow down, Mr. President.' "" This echoed something I'd heard earlier in the day from House Minority Leader John Boehner. Talking about the Blue Dog Democrats, who were slowing the pace of health care legislation in the House, Boehner said: ""It's not surprising these members would have to stand up and say 'stop.' That's what most Americans are saying."" If the members of the focus group wanted Obama to slow down, that doesn't mean they want to see less of him. Repeatedly, they said they liked hearing from the president and approved of the way he explained things. When asked to say what helped shape their views about Obama--they were given a list of 15 factors, such as giving the military the go-ahead to shoot the Somali pirates, his family life, and his proposed overhaul of health care--seven of the 12 picked ""press conferences and town-hall sessions around the country."" It was the most popular factor. But just because they like to hear from Obama doesn't mean they like everything he says. They were irritated when the president inserted himself in the arrest of Henry Louis Gates. It wasn't because Obama seemed to pick a side but because he shot his mouth off and meddled (though everyone seemed to like that Obama tried to improve his remarks later). If there was a more general warning sign in this, it was that later in the session a few in the group--all of them Obama voters--talked about the president's lack of humility. Hart tries in these focus groups to get at political attitudes indirectly. At one point, he asked the group to describe what Obama's spine is made of. The answers ranged from steel to sand. Marsha Welder, 59, an account manager at a security firm, said ""wet cement,"" because ""it's going to dry."" It was fitting description for an evening when everyone seemed to be practicing, and preaching, patience."	A look behind Obama's declining poll numbers.
8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/07/the_bipartisan_divide.html	"You may remember the old Folgers coffee commercial in which they replaced restaurant coffee with Folgers and diners didn't notice the switch. A similar taste test may be happening in Washington. Administration aides are replacing the traditional definition of bipartisanship with their version in the hopes that people don't notice but still like the result. For the last few weeks, Obama's aides have argued that the traditional measure of bipartisanship--counting the number of Republicans voting on a bill sponsored by a Democrat or vice versa--is too limiting. Another way to measure bipartisanship is how many ideas from the opposition party are included in a bill. So even if no actual Republicans vote for a bill, that doesn't mean it's a partisan product: It could still contain some amount of Republican flavoring. Another measure of bipartisanship, argues Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, is whether the president or Democrats have participated in good-faith negotiations. The president was highlighting the first criterion today. Heralding the passage of a health care bill by the Senate committee on health, education labor, and pensions, the president noted that the bill ""includes more than 160 Republican amendments--a hopeful sign of bipartisan support for the final product."" Obama also met with Senate Republicans at the White House to discuss health care, showing that, per the second criterion, he's certainly trying to reach out. Bipartisanship, whether in fact or in name, is worth holding on to because Obama's promises to end the partisanship in Washington was a central appeal of his candidacy. Plus, independent voters, who have been drifting away from Obama, tend to like the concept. White House aides have been trying to redefine bipartisanship since the stimulus bill. They felt the old definition tied their hands and led to a bad result. In order to meet Obama's promise that the stimulus bill would be bipartisan, they had to get some Republican support. They shopped and shopped but could get only three Republicans in the Senate. Even that was a defeat relative to initial claims that Obama would get 70 votes in the Senate--and the price was very high given the provisions they traded away to court opposition support. Some Republicans, like Iowa's Chuck Grassley, didn't vote for the final bill even though some of his conditions had been met. Meanwhile, in the House, White House efforts resulted in not a single Republican vote. The effort at redefinition has picked up recently because time is running out. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says that he's going to bring health care reform to the floor by July 27. Someone should put the coffee pot on. Before the Senate can start those two weeks of debate, a lot of work has to be done. The Senate finance committee, which has not started marking up its legislation, will have to start that process almost immediately. After that's completed, staffers will have to spend the weekend melding the finance committee bill with the other Senate bill that just passed today. Obama has said the House and Senate must vote on their health care bills before Congress recesses in early August. With Democrats in the House and Senate balking over some provisions, there may not be enough time to get Democrats in line and convince a handful of Republicans and meet the deadline. So aides are laying the groundwork so that they can claim a party-line vote is really a bipartisan one. There's also a chance that this attempt at redefinition is just a ruse. Obama's aides are threatening to pass a bill with only Democrats supporting it to frighten Republicans. If Republicans think Democrats will go it alone, the thinking goes, maybe they'll relent in negotiations. A bill they don't like but can shape is preferable to a potentially worse bill on which they have no say. Democratic staffers report that Reid thinks in the end he's likely to pick up a few Republicans, which may mean that Obama can herald a genuine bipartisan compromise without fiddling with definitions. But if that doesn't work out, the president and his congressional allies may decide that, having tried to incorporate Republican ideas and work with Republicans, they just can't give in anymore or waste any more time and must go their own partisan way. There's a case to be made for that. But embracing partisanship while trying to call it bipartisan would be too much of a rhetorical stretch--even for this president who has a gift for speechmaking. In  The Audacity of Hope, then-Sen. Obama wrote: ""The majority party can begin every negotiation by asking for 100 percent of what it wants, go on to concede 10 percent, and then accuse any member of the minority party who fails to support the 'compromise' of being 'obstructionist.' For the minority party in such circumstances, 'bipartisanship' comes to mean getting chronically steamrolled, although individual senators may enjoy certain political rewards by consistently going along with the majority and hence gaining a reputation for being 'moderate' or 'centrist.' "" There is another term for what Obama is doing that would be consistent with his previous definitions. In a 2007 interview with Frank Rich, he said: ""There are some times where we need to be less bipartisan. I'm not interested in cheap bipartisanship. We should have been less bipartisan in asking tough questions about entering into this Iraq war."" The president has made the case for health care as a national priority. If he thinks Republicans aren't meeting the challenge of the day, then he should go his own way. That might be the right thing to do instead of engaging in ""cheap bipartisanship."" But to take that route and call it bipartisan would be cheap."	Obama's partisan attempt to change the meaning of bipartisanship.
9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/07/lost_in_translation.html	"When America is finally ready to reckon with the phenomenon that was Sarah Palin, I suspect we will discover that whatever she represents actually had less to do with her gender, class, or ideology than we now believe. It's easy to look at the soon-to-be-former governor of Alaska as an iconic feminist, a path-breaking working mother, or noble rabble-rousing populist. But when the dust settles, the lesson may be that she was simply a woman who made no sense. Her meteoric rise and dubious fall will say less about America than you think, beyond the fact that America likes its politicians to communicate their ideas clearly. We will someday come to realize that while it's all well and good to be mavericky with one's policies, it's never smart to be mavericky with one's message. Whatever you may think of Sarah Palin, she's widely celebrated as a rare and perhaps raw political talent. She's gorgeous, charismatic, warm, and funny. She has a remarkable ability to connect with her listeners. But--with the exception of a well-scripted performance at the Republican National Convention--it's tough to find an extemporaneous Palin speech, statement, or tweet that contains a coherent message. From her acceptance speech last August in Dayton, Ohio, when McCain first tapped her as a running mate, to her circular and swooping prime-time interviews, Palin's political skill lies in selling a persona but not a message. And in the end, this may explain why she quit. Palin's completely inscrutable resignation speech last week was only the most recent example of a lengthy political communication from her that explained nothing, clarified nothing, and expounded upon nothing, save for the fact that she speaks in riddles and koans. Watch it as many times as you like; you still come away feeling you've been treated to a cozy chat with the Mad Hatter. The media are bad. Those ethics complaints are expensive. Alaska was a great idea. She is not a dead fish. Put it all together and what do you get? A born fighter who has given us no sense whatsoever of what she's fighting for. Had Palin simply quit without giving a press conference, there might have been a lesson in this exercise. Feminists would be free to say there are double standards for women, and conservatives could argue she was too visionary for her time. But Palin's act of explaining her resignation to us in a torrent of unconnected sentence fragments left everyone wondering, What was the point of Sarah Palin? If she cannot even communicate a simple idea (""I'm quitting because ...""), why should we care that she's quitting? That's why the strangest part of the Sarah Palin saga will always be her loathing of the media. She never failed to remind us that she didn't like being ""filtered."" She only wanted to talk directly to us, her listeners. Yet the reason Sarah Palin continues to have any kind of political force at all in this country is because of the media ""filter."" The media helped refine and define her Dada statements and arguments into something that briefly sounded like a coherent worldview. Yesterday morning, Gov. Palin excoriated Andrea Mitchell for ""not listening to me"" in an NBC interview. You have to go back and watch the clip before you can apprehend that Mitchell was indeed listening. It was Palin who was speaking in half-expressed thoughts and internal contradictions. It's too easy to characterize Sarah Palin as an irrational bundle of bristling grievance. But I think it's more complicated than her simple love for playing the victim all the time. If you think of Palin as someone who never felt herself to be fully heard or understood, not truly politically realized in the eyes of the American public, her rage toward the country, the media, and those of us who fail to love and understand her is easier to comprehend. Think of an American visiting France who believes that if he just speaks louder, he will be speaking French. Palin has done everything in her power to explain herself to us, and still we fail to appreciate what she is all about. I'd be frustrated, too, if I thought I was offering up straight talk and nobody was getting the message. Especially if I held a degree in communications. Once you understand that Palin's only actual message is the importance of loving and understanding Palin, it becomes easier to understand why she quit. The more Palin tries to explain herself, the more we all fail to get her. Every time she goes off script, she makes less sense. No wonder she didn't want to do debate prep or be coached by the McCain communications team. Instead of thanking those who packaged, explained, and spun her, Palin resents them. And because she believes she has been crystal clear all along, she's come to resent us, too. The enduring political lesson of Sarah Palin may simply be that for most of her political career she's been lost in translation, without fully appreciating that only in translation was she ever, briefly found."	Why Sarah Palin really quit us.
10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/07/stimulus_ii.html	"Rumblings about a second stimulus package began over the weekend, when Vice President Joe Biden told George Stephanopoulos on This Week that the administration ""misread how bad the economy was."" Speculation spiked again when Laura Tyson, an Obama adviser, suggested in a speech in Singapore on Tuesday that the first $787 billion stimulus was ""a bit too small."" President Obama then refused to rule it out: ""I don't take anything off the table when unemployment is close to 10 percent and a lot of Americans are hurting out there,"" he said. The official administration line is that it's too early to call. ""Any discussion of a second stimulus is premature at this point,"" says spokeswoman Jen Psaki. But everyone else seems ready to have that discussion. ""I think we need to be open to whether we need additional action,"" said Majority Leader Steny Hoyer on Tuesday. House Minority Whip Eric Cantor agreed: ""We stand ready and willing to work with the president to produce a bill that will actually yield results."" From a strictly economic perspective, the jury is still out. Congress passed the Recovery Act six months ago, but job losses continue, with nearly 500,000 jobs shed in June. The unemployment rate has now reached 9.5 percent, the highest in nearly 26 years. That's worse than the administration's baseline job-loss scenariowithout the stimulus. Paul Krugman is now calling for ""a second round, ASAP."" Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research says, ""I think we can make that call already."" But Mark Zandi of Moody's Economy.com says give it a few more months: The rollout so far, from tax cuts to state aid to infrastructure spending, has been ""pretty much what we expected."" Former Reagan-administration economist Bruce Bartlett argues it's too soon to double down, since a huge chunk of funds don't get spent until 2010 and 2011. Politically speaking, though, it's hard to imagine the administration standing pat if jobs continue to hemorrhage. In which case, the question is, what would a second stimulus look like? Everyone agrees it would have to be different from the first. Initially, size mattered. This time around, the most important factor may be speed. And the fastest way to get money into American hands is tax cuts. The first round included nearly $250 billion in individual and business tax relief. This time, the portion would probably be even larger. ""House Republicans have said from January 1 that any 'stimulus' bill needed to be about the creation, protection, and preservation of jobs,"" says Cantor spokesman Brad Dayspring. In other words, no temporary construction jobs that last till only 2011. Republicans proposed a payroll tax holiday back in January. Come September, says Zandi, that option might not look so bad. Another relatively speedy way to jumpstart the economy would be to give more money directly to state and local governments. That money gets spent a lot faster, since the programs it goes to--food stamps, for instance, or unemployment insurance--already exist. Construction projects, by contrast, take a while to plan. That's why less than 5 percent of the money allocated to the Department of Transportation has so far been spent. (That presumably includes the ""shovel-ready"" projects that began right away.) Giving states money makes sense from a need-based perspective, too. If the downturn continues, state budgets will be at risk of collapse. (See California, State of.) Other fast-moving ideas are circulating. Baker proposes a tax cut for employers that gives their workers paid time off. With their employees on government-paid holiday, businesses would then be free to use their own money to hire new people, chipping away at unemployment. More jobs, more money, more vacation. What's not to like? Of course, the politics of this plan are difficult, to say the least: The government would be paying people not to work. But Baker reasons that since these private-sector jobs already exist, the hiring--and the stimulus--would happen right away. Passing a second stimulus would be harder than the first. It would force the administration to make sacrifices to reduce the deficit, like guaranteeing that health care reform is paid for and preventing more home foreclosures. It would also mean the end of the inherited economy. No longer could Obama blame the consequences on the previous administration. At the same time, however, a second stimulus would help Obama spread some of the blame (or credit) for the economy to the opposition party. For Republicans, a tax-cut-centric stimulus would be a ""we told you so"" moment--even though some economists blame the failure of the current stimulus on its GOP-driven watering-down. Perhaps that's why the administration is determined to stave off a second stimulus. It would give conservatives their biggest talking point since stagflation."	What would a second stimulus package look like?
11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/07/checks_and_balances.html	"The Obama White House recently released the salaries of its 487 staffers. The highest-paid administration staffer, the president's director of public health policy, David Marcozzi, earns $193,000, while salaries bottom out at $36,000. The president himself makes $400,000, a salary set by Congress. Two advisers, Michael J. Warren and Patricia G. McGinnis, forgo pay altogether. How does the White House decide who makes what? There's a rough formula for how much executive branch staffers make. White House salaries are on a scale associated with certain ranks. The top rank in the White House consists of those staffers who hold the title ""assistant to the president."" Twenty-two people in the Obama administration have that rank--including David Axelrod, Rahm Emanuel, and Jon Favreau--and they all get paid the same amount: $172,000. Marcozzi earns more than the assistants to the president because he's on detail from the Department of Health and Human Services, which pays his salary. (After six months, ""detailees"" have to switch to White House payroll.) The next level below the assistants are the ""deputy assistants to the president,"" all of whom make between $130,000 and $150,000. Further down still are ""special assistants to the president,"" who earn anywhere from $50,000 to $130,000. And below that are the staff assistants, legislative assistants, press assistants, secretaries, greeters, speechwriters, advance coordinators, and record keepers--i.e., the bulk of the White House staff--who make between $40,000 and $55,000. Chief of staff Rahm Emanuel decides, in consultation with the president, which one of these categories you fall into, according to a few former White House staffers and presidential scholars. (That said, Rahm isn't signing your checks. That job falls to the personnel office.) There's no rule for how many assistants a president can have: Obama has 22; George W. Bush had 18. In general, anyone with regular access to the president who is not a secretary gets an assistant title. Within each category--except the top one--there's some salary flexibility. For example, the director for African-American media makes $13,000 more than the director for Hispanic media. Some staff assistants make $36,000, while others make $41,000. Why the variation? Says one White House official: ""White House salaries are determined based first on the funds available for salaries, then taking into account the role and the level of experience and educational background required of the individual filling that role."" If you don't like what you're offered, can you negotiate a better deal? Sure, within limits. But if you get a raise, it's usually because you advanced a rank--not because you managed to squeeze a few extra nickels out of your boss. Of course, no one works at the White House for the money. Most staffers could make triple their salary in the private sector. As a result, hard-core pay negotiations are fairly rare. The total spending on salaries is determined by Congress, which has to approve the annual White House budget. In 2007, President Bush requested a total of $51.9 million for White House office salaries. (That's for the core of 500 or so staffers.) The numbers creep up every year. In 2003, the maximum pay for assistants was $151,000. Since then, it has increased between 1.7 percent and 4 percent annually. In 2008, it reached $172,000 and remains there, since Obama declared a pay freeze for anyone making more than $100,000. The White House staff wasn't always so expensive--or expansive. Thomas Jefferson had only one messenger and one secretary, both of whom he paid out of pocket. In 1857, Congress finally allocated $2,500 to hire a single White House clerk. By the turn of the century, the White House had added a ""secretary to the president,"" two assistant secretaries, two executive clerks, and a stenographer. Herbert Hoover was the first president to hire a press secretary. The staff grew under Franklin Delano Roosevelt and has exploded since, adding the Council of Economic Advisers, the National Security Council, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, and so on. (Some of these, like CEA and NSC, are included on the White House salary list. Others are not.) Historian Bradley Patterson, a veteran of the Eisenhower administration who has written extensively on the White House staff, estimates there are about now 5,700 people in the ""White House staff family,"" including residence staff, Secret Service details, Camp David employees, Air Force One crew, and so on. Add all the other offices connected to the White House--Office of Management and Budget, the Council on Environmental Quality, the Office of National Drug Control Policy--and Patterson estimates the total cost of salaries at a whopping $1.6 billion."	Who decides how much White House staffers get paid?
12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/06/heartless.html	"Mark Sanford is no longer missing, but he's obviously lost. The South Carolina governor's press conference was excruciating: apology, followed by self-flagellation, followed by apology. It was like watching a man light himself on fire. I thought about his kids mustering up the courage to watch it on YouTube some day. I thought about his wife having to suffer the anger and the loss. Perhaps even worse, she's also going to have to endure the armies of pity and the people like me trying to guess what her feelings are. The scandal has ended Sanford's national political career. If the affair wasn't enough to do in Sanford as a presidential candidate, his erratic behavior was. He may be forced to resign as governor. Even if he stays in office, Democrats will figure out how much to exploit the scandal for their advantage. The Sanford episode makes the bad position of the Republican Party only marginally worse. The fundamental problem for Republicans is they have no leader. Perhaps Sanford could have been that guy, but I don't think the GOP is going to solve its problems with a white man from the heart of the Confederacy. They have that vote covered. The personal impact of the Sanford affair is more gripping than the political. Sanford has done a horrible thing to his wife and family and friends. He seemed to know and feel this more profoundly than other politicians we've seen go through this familiar apology exercise before. That doesn't excuse him. Not that he was asking that anyone excuse him. He seemed to be trying to take all the blame, as he should. Some might think his explanations were excuses. To me they seemed like a man confessing the details of a crime. The minute Sanford started speaking, the reviews poured in via e-mail and Twitter. He was rambling, confused. He didn't tear up enough when talking about his wife. He favored his mistress. He answered the questions too thoroughly. All these judgments seemed absurd. A man standing in front of a bank of cameras in the middle of a complete collapse is going to say a lot of things poorly. The snap judgments failed to acknowledge a grain of the fundamental human carnage we were witnessing. You can laugh at Sanford, as you can laugh at a video of a wrecked Amy Winehouse falling all over her house. But at some point, even though they did it to themselves, you have to feel sorry for them as human beings. You can do that, I think, and not be a fan of adultery or drug use. I'm not offering Sanford's humanity as an excuse. I'm just marveling at how few people stopped for a moment to even nod to it. My thoughtful colleague William Saletan and Andrew Sullivan were exceptions. Maybe there are others. Maybe people expressed these views in private conversations. But in the e-mails and Twitter entries and blog posts I read in the aftermath, Sanford's human ruin was greeted with what felt like antiseptic glee. The pain he's caused, the hypocrisies he's engaged in, seemed like license to deny him any humanity at all. Sanford's fumbling efforts to explain how he's tried to rescue himself with his faith offered some people an opportunity to make fun of his religion, as if a confused, lost, flawed person were the right spokesman for anything. People tend to think the most awful thing about a person is the most true thing. They also apparently think it's the most true thing about his or her associations. So an e-mail arrived asking, ""[I]s there any Republican not sleeping around?"" Maybe Sanford should have been a presidential candidate. He apparently represents an entire party and an entire religion. What Mark Sanford seemed to be trying to say is that he screwed up, in the biggest possible way, because he lost his bearings. He lost his self-control. He was indulgent. He forgot that there were other humans in the world. Yet in the constant flow of abuse, joke-making, and grand conclusions about his failings, it seemed everyone having a good time pointing at his self-indulgence was also engaging in a form of it.

Mark Sanford needs all the help he can get. But if his supporters follow his example, Sanford may not get much sympathy after his confession of an extramarital affair. As a member of the U.S. House, where he served from 1995 to 2001, Sanford was not very forgiving of prospective House Speaker Bob Livingston when it was revealed he'd had an affair. ""The bottom line is Livingston lied,"" Sanford told CNN. ""He lied to his wife."" It's never easy for a politician to cop to an affair (see Edwards, John). But it's also hard for colleagues to react to the revelation. And what they say can make their lives difficult if they ever make the transition from scandal commentator to scandal subject. So what's a politician to say when asked about a colleague who--on his side of the aisle or not--is caught with his pants down? Herewith, a guide to some possible responses. Sanctimonious condemnation. Especially if most other politicians are mincing words reacting to a scandal, you can score points and get noticed with a pithy tongue-lashing. Sen. Joe Lieberman got a lot of mileage (and network time) from his tongue-lashing of President Clinton, delivered from the Senate floor, over the Monica Lewinsky affair. Longtime Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch caught wordsmith William Safire's attention with his jab that Clinton was ""perhaps the first presidential canoodler in history."" The risk here is obvious: Take Sen. John Ensign of Nevada, who admitted last week to an eight-month extramarital affair with a campaign staffer. His situation was made several degrees worse by his past reactions to the affairs of others. When former Sen. Larry Craig was facing charges of soliciting sex in a Minneapolis airport restroom, Ensign said Craig was ""embarrassing not only to himself and his family but to the U.S. Senate."" He condemned President Clinton during the Lewinsky affair, saying the president ""has no credibility left."" Whoops! Edwards, who admitted in August to his own tryst, also spoke too soon when he said of Bill Clinton at a closed impeachment hearing: ""I think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office, for the moral dimensions of leadership, for his friends, for his wife, for his precious daughter. It is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen."" The Clinton-Lewinsky scandal was the source of at least one more back-to-bite-you quip when ""DC Madam"" patron and GOP Sen. David Vitter called the president ""morally unfit to govern"" and argued that ""his leadership will only further drain any sense of values left to our political culture."" Praise the apology, not the apologizer. Once the wrongdoer makes his mea culpas, you can dodge the divisive question of right or wrong. This tactic is especially useful if you have to deal with him in the future--nothing like an awkward Senate floor rendezvous to interfere with affairs of state. Sen. Jim DeMint, R.-S.C., played spokesman for Vitter's soul when he said, ""It's a huge moral failure that reflects on the whole body. And for that he's very sorry."" A colleague's apology also gives you more ammunition to defend him, as Sen. John Cornyn of Texas did for Ensign: ""He's apologized to his constituents and his colleagues and acknowledged a grave error,"" he said, while dismissing calls for Ensign to resign. Stall for time. If you can't find any upside to commenting on a compatriot's peccadilloes, it's probably safe to just punt--boilerplate quotes usually disappear in the news cycle anyway. Often, it works to simply claim ignorance of the details, as then-Sen. Barack Obama did when asked about Edwards' affair. ""I really haven't seen the details of it, so I don't know what's going on,"" he said. ""I'm a little in the dark."" Even then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich appeared the model of even-handedness when he urged patience in the furor over President Clinton's unfolding indiscretions: ""I think every citizen ought to slow down, relax, and wait for the facts to develop,"" he said. ""When we know, then is the time to comment."" If you're really under the gun, a simple stonewall may suffice. Both Sen. Jon Kyl (""I'm not going to say anything"") and Sen. Chuck Grassley (""It would be intellectually dishonest for me to comment"") kept their hands clean when asked about fellow Republican John Ensign's infidelity. Focus on the family. Sticking by the wronged wife and children is the safest route. It implicitly rips the cad who embarrassed his closest kin and scores a point for family values. Better yet, it refrains from moral judgment that can come back to hurt you. Focusing on the family can also spruce up a ""no comment"" comment. When news emerged last March that Eliot Spitzer had been seeing a prostitute, John McCain took this path. ""I was just watching, as all of you have, this information about the governor of New York,"" he said. ""I don't know what to make of it--our prayers go out to his family."" Hillary Clinton, the wronged wife in scandals past, was similarly cautious in responding to the affair. ""I obviously am sending my best wishes and thoughts to the governor and to his family,"" she said. ""Let's wait and see what comes out of the next days. Right now I don't have any comment. I think it's appropriate to wish his family well and see how things develop."" The personal is not political. The closest you can get to having a guy's back in this situation is to say he messed up but shouldn't be judged in the public sphere. It's especially useful when your own past is speckled, and when you've put the canoodler in a position of trust: former presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani stuck up for his Southern campaign chairman, Sen. David Vitter, while artfully salvaging his own reputation. ""I believe that this is a personal issue,"" he said, and went on to say that most of those he appointed were ""outstanding people."" In justifying his vote to acquit President Clinton, Sen. Evan Bayh kicked the moral matter upstairs. ""Ultimately, he will be judged for his sins by that tribunal before which we all must stand one day,"" he said. ""But we must apply a mortal, constitutional standard here."" The heavenly retribution strategy hits on two fronts, pleasing the religious base while freeing you from the risk of actually taking action. Flat-out denial. Nothing says loyalty like blind faith in the face of inconvenient truths. Said then-Vice President Al Gore of his boss in 1998: ""The president has denied the charges, and I believe it."" Make up a limerick. Should only be used if you have nothing to lose. In 2007, John Kerry composed this gem: There once was a man named Vitter Who vowed that he wasn't a quitter But with stories of women And all of his sinnin' He knows his career's in the--oh, never mind.

14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/06/hoop_dreams.html	"During his campaign, President Obama encouraged young people to follow their dreams--unless those dreams were to become a basketball player. You are simply not that good at basketball, Obama told a crowd of high-school students in Georgia last July: ""I know you think you are. But you're not. You are overrated in your own mind. You will not play in the NBA."" And yet, less than a year later, here were Miami Heat stars Dwyane Wade and Alonzo Mourning, holding court at a Northeast Washington middle school on Friday, describing how they did just that. The Wade/Mourning duo was just one of several pairs of men who, as part of the White House's pre-Father's Day celebrations, fanned out across the area, talking to kids at schools and community centers about the responsibilities of being a man and a father. Other dad pairs included former Pittsburgh Steelers coach Bill Cowher and Run DMC member Darryl McDaniels, pro skateboarder Tony Hawk and Univision anchor Jorge Ramos, and Washington Wizard Etan Thomas and Sen. Evan Bayh. Wade and Mourning did touch on the joys and challenges of fatherhood. But the kids, all between the ages of 3 and 21, all male, mostly wanted to know about their game. ""Can you shoot a 3-pointer?"" asked one young man who looked about 8. ""If I couldn't, I wouldn't have a job,"" Wade replied. Another wanted to know how they became basketball stars. Wade described growing up in Chicago, where he took up basketball because ""it wasn't cool for me to be going to jail at a young age."" Mourning turned the question on its side. ""As hard as I worked on the basketball court, I had to work just as hard in the classroom,"" he said. ""Don't put all your eggs in one basket. You can't just say, I'm going to be a basketball player and that's it."" One boy had several follow-ups: Did they play together? For what team? Why was Mourning retired? Apparently Obama's message had not quite gotten through. (I was waiting for someone to ask Wade if he really has herpes, but no one did.) Back at the White House, Wade and Mourning joined the other fathers and a few dozen local students for a ""town hall"" in the East Room, where Obama discussed the importance of responsible fathers. ""Just because your own father wasn't there for you, that's not an excuse for you to be absent also,"" he told the audience. ""It's all the more reason for you to be present."" Everyone soon moved out to the South Lawn, where high-school boys sat in clusters, listening politely while the fathers doled out valuable lessons in the allotted 15 minutes. It was like a giant birds-and-bees talk. In one circle, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood was making little headway. ""Anyone want to talk about your father? Fathers?"" asked LaHood. Silence. ""I'll talk about mine,"" said the man next to him, before launching into some family history. One student glanced longingly at the Run DMC group. When Mourning arrived, however, faces lit up. ""They know who you are,"" said the father who had been talking. Mourning, who retired last year after getting a kidney transplant, waxed nostalgic: ""When you get to be our age, you're gonna want to be your age. So enjoy it."" Obama soon came by and shook hands with the students. ""We've got a guy here looking for the basketball court,"" said LaHood, pointing to Mourning. Obama smiled. ""I already recruited him, he's on my team."" The next circle over, Vice President Joe Biden was answering a question at length. ""... My No. 2 son, who's down here, he's a lawyer. He wanted to go to law school, he went to Yale. Now I don't like those Ivy League schools, I went to a state school. But all kidding aside, he went to Yale, he didn't learn anything except how to run a homeless shelter."" The lesson being, it's not about where you go to school. It's about confidence. ""Think about any time you've been beat in competition,"" Biden said, citing a dubious (but unprovable and therefore ideal) statistic: ""There's an 85 percent chance the guy who beat you is more confident, more self-assured."" Don't be intimidated, he said. ""They're not smarter than you. They may be better educated, but they're not smarter."" Biden was about to make another point when he turned to Education Secretary Arne Duncan, who was sitting next to him. ""The thing I love about this guy--this guy, by the way, helluva basketball player,"" Biden said, hand on Duncan's shoulder. An aide soon tapped Duncan that it was time to move. Biden turned to see a row of notebooks behind him. ""I didn't realize I had the press behind me,"" he said, laughing. ""Did I say anything stupid?"" Time for food. Chicken, corn on the cob, and other goodies prepared by top chef and reported No. 1 dad Bobby Flay. Everyone headed over to the grill. Obama shook a few last hands and took off. ""What do you want for Father's Day?"" asked one reporter as he left. Obama thought for a second. ""A health care bill."""	Father's Day advice from Dwyane Wade, Alonzo Mourning, and Joe Biden.
15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/09/doctor_joe.html	"Leading up to President Obama's 100th day in office, the administration made fun of reporters for fussing over an artificial milestone. The 200th day of the Recovery and Reinvestment Act, on the other hand, is important enough to merit a celebratory press release; four speeches by Cabinet secretaries across the country; a major address in Washington from Joe Biden; and, if we're lucky, a commemorative Biden bobblehead doll handcrafted by American workers. Why all the attention? Because the 200th day of the stimulus couldn't have come at a better time. (The timing is so good, I counted the days just to make sure.) For one thing, the stimulus seems to be working. Earlier this summer, Biden said the stimulus had ""saved or created""--that great, irrefutable phrase--150,000 jobs after 100 days and would save or create 600,000 more after 200 days. In his speech today, he cited private sector economists who estimate the stimulus has created or saved 500,000 to 750,000 jobs and boosted GDP growth in the second quarter by 2.2 percent. More important, though, the stimulus commemoration dovetails with the administration's attempted CPR on health care reform. So while Biden's speech was nominally about the success of the stimulus package, it was also about health care--albeit from a perspective of about 10,000 feet. In many respects the debate over health care has become a debate about the economy. Obama originally made his case for reform in terms of cost savings: Without reform, Medicare would go bankrupt in eight years and the deficit would keep trending upward. Meanwhile, the effect of health care reform on the national debt has become the opposition's favorite talking point. At a Monday town hall, Sens. John McCain and Mitch McConnell argued that a public option would add to the deficit, exacerbating the current recession and burdening generations to come. By making Americans less nervous about the economy, the administration hopes to make them less nervous about health care reform. To that end, one theme of Biden's speech was straightforward: If you like what we're doing with the economy, you'll love what we're planning for health care. For example, the stimulus has been complex, he said, with thousands of projects in every state. Yet the government has been able to juggle them all! A major criticism of the stimulus was that the money didn't get doled out fast enough and that the projects that did get funding would take too long. Well, not only are many projects finishing up early, said Biden, they're finishing under budget. The government initially committed $1.1 billion for 300 airport projects. ""We're now going to finish those projects for $200 million less than the original estimates,"" he said. (Never mind the fact that some economists say the whole point of the stimulus money is to spend it all.) The stimulus has also been accountable, he said. Biden told the story about how if something goes wrong in the stimulus, he wants to know, so he can announce it. ""To gain credibility,"" he said, ""we have to demonstrate and acknowledge when we screw up."" Trust plays into health care reform, too, as much of the opposition to a public option stems from a basic distrust of the government. Biden's message: You can count on us. But the similarities between the stimulus package and health care reform go deeper. As it turns out, the two policy goals are interlinked. In his speech today, Biden made sure to mention the economic benefits of electronic health records, to which the stimulus package allocated $19 billion. They will prevent redundancy, he argued, saving patients and taxpayers money. Plus, a major reason the stimulus has worked, Biden said, is because of ""leverage."" Wind turbines, he said, don't just create jobs; they generate power, save money, and wean the United States off foreign oil--all at the same time! Likewise, electronic health records will improve health care statistics, which produces better diagnoses, which makes Americans more healthy, which means they won't have to visit the doctor as much, which saves money, and so on. Underlying the stimulus anniversary, therefore, is an implicit bargain:Let us fix the health care system the way you let us fix the economy. There's a downside, though: This message downplays the urgency of health care reform. Panic is always a strong incentive. If the public is less concerned about its economic welfare, it may also think saving money through health care reform is less important. All this depends, of course, on whether people believe the administration when it says that health care reform will save money. Polls suggest they're not convinced. Perhaps they'll change their minds in another 100 days."	Joe Biden wants you to know how well the stimulus is going.
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/09/talking_cure.html	President Obama didn't wear a bike helmet on vacation, but maybe he should when he returns to work next week. He'll need it to protect himself from the hail of incoming advice about how he should handle the health-care-reform fight. He's being told to be less liberal, change his message, stay on course, get more emotional, and (by everyone) to get more hands-on. The president will get more involved, aides promise. He will get more specific about what he wants and build a coalition in Congress around those ideas. Then, he'll have to convince the public and hope that specificity will improve his connection with the American people. Until now, despite his constant effort to sell health care reform, the public-opinion numbers have been moving against him. In a just-released CBS poll, 40 percent approve of his handling of the health care issue, down seven points from a month ago. A plurality of Americans (47 percent) disapprove. How did things get so low? If the president is going to make a new and successful pitch, knowing where he went wrong might help him keep from making the same mistake in the future. A lot of smart analysts are saying that one of Obama's big mistakes--perhaps his biggest mistake--is that he talked too much about lowering health care costs as a way to shrink the budget deficit. (Slate's own Mickey Kaus has been arguing this for months.) Because the president was fixated on accounting, goes this argument, he didn't address the issue of security--people's worries that they'd lose coverage or their job or face financial ruin because of the broken system. Is this right? Obama's budget director talked about the deficit, naturally (it's his job), and Obama has said regularly that the key to reducing the deficit is controlling health care costs, but looking back over  the president's  speeches, meetings, town halls and forums on health care, you discover there was something else he always talked about first and more extensively when it came to health care costs: personal security. Here is a typical comment from a town hall in Green Bay, Wis., in early June:	Has Obama failed to sell health care reform? Or are Americans just not in the mood to buy?
17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/08/hot_in_here.html	"If you want a sneak preview of the fight over climate-change legislation in the Senate, look no further than the current battle over health care reform. Compare: In July, the House released a relatively liberal health care bill, complete with a public option and mandates for individuals and employers. In June, the House passed a relatively liberal climate-change bill, complete with a cap-and-trade provision and a mandate that 15 percent of the nation's electricity come from renewable sources like wind and solar by 2020. Now the fate of health care reform lies with the finance committee, where Democratic members of the ""Gang of Six"" are making concessions--scrapping the public option in favor of a cooperative model, for example--in an attempt to win over Republicans. Similarly, when the Senate reconvenes in September, the fate of climate legislation will come down to a handful of senators hashing out compromises--or watering down the bill, depending on your perspective. And given the politics and personalities involved, the Senate battle over climate change could get just as hairy. The key committee drafting the Senate legislation is the Committee on Environment and Public Works, chaired by Sen. Barbara Boxer of California. Boxer says she plans to have a draft ready soon after the Senate reconvenes on Sept. 8. But that's just one committee. Five others could produce their own legislation, including the agriculture, foreign relations, commerce, and finance committees. (The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources has already reported its.) Whether they do depends on how unpleasant they want to make Harry Reid's life. Reid, the Senate majority leader, has set a deadline of Sept. 28 for the committees to finish. But already some senators--Democratic senators, no less--have been hedging. This month, four Democrats said they think the energy provisions, like mandating renewable sources, should be separated from the climate provisions, like cap and trade. Combined, the bill is ""too big a lift,"" said Sen. Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas. Sound familiar? That's right: Senators are beginning to suggest the same solution for health care reform. Tease apart the easy stuff (requiring insurance companies to provide coverage) from the hard stuff (the public option), the thinking goes, and vulnerable members of Congress won't get as bruised. This approach doesn't make the hard stuff any easier to pass--it still takes 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. It just lets you declare partial victory instead of total failure. Reid has declared that the climate bill will not be split. But then there remains the task of winning over a big chunk of conservative Democratic senators from states with major energy interests. Sen. Mary Landrieu, who represents oil and gas hub Louisiana, has declined to rule out the filibuster on climate-change legislation. Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska is likely to speak for farm interests as a member of the agriculture committee--as in, less wind energy, more ethanol. Nelson and the two Democratic senators from North Dakota, Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan, joined Lincoln in calling for Reid to strip the legislation of its climate-change provisions. Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio recently said, ""I want to support this bill, but it's got to protect manufacturing."" And in May, Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana was the only Democrat to vote against a renewable-electricity standard during a committee markup. Add in Debbie Stabenow and Carl Levin (both of Michigan), Mark Pryor (Arkansas), John Rockefeller (West Virginia), Jim Webb (Virginia), and Claire McCaskill (Missouri), all of whom did not vote for the Climate Security Act of 2008, and you've got a good dozen Democrats likely to be skittish about climate legislation as envisioned by the House. That's not to say Republicans will be entirely united. The Democrats' best shot at bipartisanship is in wooing the two senators from Maine--Susan Collins, the only Republican to get a thumbs-up from the League of Conservation voters, and Olympia Snowe, a co-chair of the International Climate Change Taskforce. Sen. John McCain is also seen as a possible supporter, according to a Republican familiar with the negotiations. But that's three votes. If Democrats want to clear 60--they don't really have the option of budget reconciliation, as they do with health care reform--they're probably going to need to make some major concessions. Like what? The debate so far has focused less on the carbon-emissions targets--the House promises a 17 percent reduction by 2020, an 83 percent reduction by 2050--and more on the regulatory nitty-gritty. For example, some senators have said that any climate bill must include a ""border adjustment mechanism,"" i.e., a tax that would prevent countries from profiting by not following the same environmental standards as the United States. Another element being debated is the size of America's strategic oil reserve, which is maintained to protect against huge swings in energy prices. But these changes alone are unlikely to appease the moderate Democrats. Luckily for Obama, he has the numbers on his side. A new Washington Post poll shows broad support for the president's handling of energy policy. (Fifty-five percent of Americans think Obama is doing it right, compared with 30 percent who don't; 52 percent support cap and trade, while 43 percent do not.) Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that the House bill, if passed, would cost the average American household only $175 per year in 2020. The Environmental Protection Agency predicted it would cost between $80 and $110 a year. (Republicans say the cost would be higher.) But as the health care debate has shown, public support matters little, and facts matter even less. And even if health care reform does pass, it's unclear that Blue Dogs will be eager to lie down for the administration a second time. In which case, perhaps climate change--not health care--could be Obama's Waterloo."	You thought the health care battle was ugly. Just wait for the climate fight.
18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/08/recess_in_name_only.html	"In Washington, only the executive branch takes a vacation. The legislative branch goes on recess. The two terms used to be nearly synonymous. While members of Congress traditionally spend the month of August meeting with constituents, fact-finding in the Middle East, or freezing bundles of cash, they leave most of their staff behind. Recesson the Hill is thus a time for short skirts, long lunches, and happy hours that start at 4. Not this year. Late Monday night, some congressional staffers were leaving their offices as late as 9 p.m., because when a divisive national issue (health care reform) meets planned legislative downtime (August recess), the divisive national issue wins. The battle over health care--waged in districts across the country by phone, television, e-mail, and town hall--has sucked up what's supposed to be a rejuvenating period between the first week of August and Labor Day. It wasn't always this way. In past years, you might have stumbled across a hall party outside a member's office on a Friday afternoon, where staffers could greet the weekend with a brewski (paid for with nontaxpayer dollars, of course). Bars like the Pour House and Hawk and Dove would fill up as early as 5 p.m. One Democratic office may or may not have had a Wii that would get fired up for 18 holes of golf every afternoon. But that was 2007. ""There's no silliness this summer,"" says Brad Bauman, communications director for Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio. ""This year it's trench warfare--just without ties."" Still, even in the heat of battle, August is the most casual month. On a baking Tuesday morning, for example, staffers lined up outside the Longworth House Office Building looked more like a high-school lunch line than a congressional army. Jeans outnumbered suits. Sneakers outnumbered loafers. There seemed to be a strict ban on ties. Most offices let staffers wear whatever they want. The office of Rep. Harry Teague of New Mexico, for instance, is denim-friendly. ""When the congressman isn't here, we can wear jeans,"" one staffer told me when I poked my head in. Does he know about this flagrant abandonment of professionalism? ""I think he knows,"" she said. The office of Rep. Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania runs a tighter ship--it's because he's a Navy officer, I was told. Staffers have to wear business attire, no matter the month. With the lax dress code comes occasional lax behavior. Spend enough time wandering the halls of House and Senate buildings in August, and you're bound to witness the phenomenon best described as ""recest."" Two congressional staffers were spotted Tuesday in a back hallway locked in a passionate embrace, the gentleman gripping the lady's pearl necklace between his fingers and--NSFW--licking it aggressively. On being caught, the pair disbanded. Office decorum can also slip. ""August is when people start picking up hobbies,"" says a former Hill staffer. ""You get e-mails like, 'I'm on Season 3 of Melrose Place!' ""On Tuesday,I watched a Republican staffer in the Hart Senate Office Building check Facebook, write an e-mail, check Facebook, edit an official-looking document, and check Facebook. And whether staffers admit it or not, the hours are shorter. The security guards at Longworth acknowledged as much. Some staffers trickle in as late as 11 a.m. and the exodus begins as early as 4 p.m. Lunches get longer, too--or, rather, lunches exist in the first place. The normally long line in the Senate cafeteria was gone Tuesday. Finding a seat--normally a struggle--was easy. The gift shop was even more deserted. ""It's dead,"" said the cashier, who was polishing watches. They shortened the shop's hours for recess, but apparently not enough. ""The time passes so slowly,"" she said. At the same time, staffs shrink. Although a typical House office might have 11 people the rest of the year, it might dwindle to eight or four during August recess, when the member returns to his or her district. A Senate staff of 30 might get cut in half. Sometimes any staff whatsoever is hard to find. When I stopped by Tuesday, the office staff of Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz consisted entirely of two interns. One was huddled in a fleece, writing a letter to a constituent about immigration reform. The other was nowhere in sight but did, I was told, exist. When I peeked into the office of Illinois Rep. Mark Steven Kirk, the front office was empty. Where do the staffers go? Vacation, usually. Some offices have a rule that you can take vacation only during recess. Other staffers travel on congressional delegations, either within the country or abroad (although ethics rules make such trips less common). Some shops, however, remain full steam. I dropped in on the office of Rep. Yvette Clarke of New York to find things bustling. When I told the staff I wanted to cover the August slowdown, one of them said, ""You picked the wrong time to write that!"" They were working full days, he said, till 7 or 8 p.m. If I were expecting floor hockey and ping-pong tournaments, another said, ""You should try Cannon."" (The Cannon House Office Building, that is.) The activity level of an office during recess depends on a mix of factors. One is the member's electoral vulnerability: The safer the seat, the more relaxed the staff. It also depends whether it's an election year. Typically, August is a lot more hectic in even-numbered years than odd-numbered. Party matters, too: Democrats in the majority during the final Bush years had little reason to waste their Augusts drumming up legislation that would get vetoed. Upending all August-related rules, however, is health care. Thanks to the Democrats' decision not to vote on health care reform until September, August has for many offices been a ""recess"" in name only. Members are touring their districts, meeting with local leaders and holding town halls--a routine that often requires just as much energy from the Washington staff as when Congress is in session. ""There's a perception that when the cat's away the mice will play,"" says one Democratic staffer. ""But that doesn't really happen."" Really, when the cat's away, the mice answer crazy phone calls. Normally the call volume goes down in August. This year, it's up. A lot of calls are generated by interest groups or robo calls related to health care reform. For example, a constituent might get a call at home saying, ""Dial 1 if you want to stop socialized medicine,"" which then forwards them to their congressman's office. Paul Tencher, communications director for Rep. Mary Jo Kilroy of Ohio, says he knows when a new robocall campaign is launched--the phones start ringing off the hook. ""The rings get closer and closer together,"" he says. ""It's like contractions."" What happens next depends on the identity of the caller. First, the staffer makes sure it's a constituent. If they're not from the district, he refers to them to their congressman. If they want to talk to a legislative assistant about a particular issue, they can generally get through. Often, they want to talk to the member of Congress; some members are more amenable than others. Different offices have different philosophies for handling crazies. Some simply take a message. ""It's not our job to give an opinion,"" says Tencher. ""Our job is to hear their opinion and pass it on to the congresswoman."" Others are more confrontational.Assistants to Rep. Barney Frank, for example, are allowed to push back when they field angry calls. The result can be a full blown argument between the caller and the intern or staffer. Frank can afford such a combative style--and staffers often take their cues from him--because he represents a safe district in Massachusetts. All of which raises the question: For Congress, is August becoming just another month? Not quite, say staffers. This August is busier than most, they say, but the rest of the year is still worse. After August, says one, ""It goes from stress to shock."" When their bosses return next month, the public servants serving the public servants of the 111th Congress need to be prepared for even longer days and nights. And they'll need to wear proper pants."	What happens in congressional offices when the boss is gone?

There's the keynote series featuring big speakers like Bill Clinton and Valerie Jarrett, who turned up in Pittsburgh this weekend to reassure the liberal bloggers and activists in attendance that, yes, they do still matter and, no, Barack Obama and the Democrats have not forgotten them. Then, far from the pages of the New York Times and Wall Street Journal--or even the posts of TPM Cafe or HaveNoLifeBecauseIBlogAboutPolitics.com--there are the panels. This year's convention featured more than 100 events spread across three days in Pittsburgh's 1.5-million-square-foot David L. Lawrence Convention Center. The events generally fit into four categories: debates, promotional/informational panels, training sessions, and meet-ups. These are the events where egos clashed, internecine disagreements got hashed out, and agendas got set--or at the very least deliberated. I set out to attend every single one. With only a few exceptions--I drew the line at the fifth event on ""messaging""--I succeeded. If there was an overarching theme, it was How do we hold Obama to his campaign promises? There was plenty of concern about Obama's dedication to closing Guantanamo, abolishing indefinite detentions, shoring up gay rights, and implementing immigration reform. (Of course, between health care and climate change and fixing the economy, there are plenty of commitments the administration hasn't backed away from.) So the fundamental disagreement among attendees was: Should we of the Netroots be fundamentally supportive of Obama or should we oppose him from the left? That was the question before one Saturday panel titled ""Transformation? Or Shock?"" There, an audience member argued that the Netroots has to back the president. She was sick of people on the left yelling at Obama, claiming that he didn't share their interests. A panelist, Digby, writer of Hullabaloo, said it's possible to be respectful but firm. She compared it to the story about Franklin Delano Roosevelt telling Democratic Party activists, ""I agree with you, I want to do it, now make me do it."" Everyone on the left wants to see Obama succeed. But they can't expect him to have the courage of their convictions. If they want a public option, gays in the military, an end to indefinite detentions, they can't expect him to do it on his own--they need to make him do it. Another theme that came up over and over was What happened in 2008?--and, implicitly, How can we do it again? History is working against the Democrats in 2010. The party in control of the White House tends to lose members of Congress in its first midterm election. Yet Netroots attendees had a more optimistic take: Turnout is relatively low during midterms, so well-organized progressives have even greater influence than usual. Several panels tried to assess what went right with the Obama campaign. The answer is well-documented: trying to compete in all 50 states, working in states and regions other candidates (both Democratic and Republican) took for granted, and making voters feel like they had a voice in the campaign. But the discussion wasn't all victory lap. Organizers also wondered what they could do better. One panel considered how to reach rural voters. (Learn the local issues and make the effort to visit voters in person.) Another explored ways to turn red districts blue. The challenge, said one panelist, is not just to elect a conservative who might be a Democrat in name only, but also to tease out the district's true blueness. What happens if there simply isn't any blueness to tease out? Bad question: That's not how an organizer thinks. A number of meetings tackled how to get your message across quickly--""the elevator pitch,"" as one panelist called it. Some strategies seemed intuitive: Keep your message simple and direct. (For example, mosquito nets to fight malaria: ""Send a net. Save a life."") Use poetic license. (""Donate $1 a day to make Norm Coleman go away!"") Make sure to include a ""call to action."" (Even the simple and relatively passive ""Click here to see more"" qualifies.) Don't clutter your mass e-mails with images. Other suggestions came as a surprise, such as the tip that black-and-white political fliers are more effective than ones printed in color because they look less like slick advertisements. Perhaps the most useful meetings were the training sessions, with names like ""Congress 101,"" ""Muckraking 101,"" and ""How To Be a Media Star."" ""Congress 101"" was basically an hourlong adult version of Schoolhouse Rock, explaining the ins and outs of committees, lobbies, and interest groups. ""Muckraking 101"" was a tour of all the databases you can use besides Google. The Government Accountability Office, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and pretty much every state business registry has reams of documents you can access to dig up dirt on your least favorite companies. At the jam-packed ""Presence and Authenticity: The Secret to Being a Media Star,"" media trainer Joel Silberman dissected physicality to show how the smallest behaviors affect onscreen performance. For example, don't wear shirts lighter than your skin color. Keep your weight distributed evenly across your feet. If you're staring into a camera, look at the top of the lens and pretend it's someone you want to seduce. Less practical but more social were the meet-ups--events where bloggers and activists could meet the like-minded (or -dressed or -skinned or -aged). Some of these, like the Latino Caucus, descended into recriminations over an esoteric blog spat. Others, like the Youth Caucus, reassured groups of their own influence. But most people just wanted to talk. Take the Second Life Caucus. While more than 1,500 people attended the convention in person, about 50 showed up on Netroots Nation Island in Second Life. (Some couldn't make it for geographical reasons, others for social ones, such as agoraphobia.) There, they could watch streaming video of various Netroots events while conversing with their fellow attendees. One of them, Kelly Thome, is a political organizer in Second Life. It's also where she meets friends. ""People say, 'Oh, those aren't your real friends, they're your Second Life friends.' Well, they are real,"" she says. It hasn't been all peaceful: Some Second Life events had to be shut down due to ""griefing,"" the practice of outsiders disrupting the proceedings by dropping self-replicating objects--1,000 beach balls, say--into the world, which can obstruct the avatars and cause slowdown. Thome, who also works security in Second Life, could not say whether the interference was politically motivated. But the griefing did not stop the Lifers from doing what they came to do. ""We want to dance,"" said a middle-aged woman who identified herself by her Elvin avatar name, Leondra Whiteberry. Finally, there were the debates. Highlights included a panel of pollsters hashing out who got what right (and wrong) during the 2008 election. A discussion among religious activists challenged what they called antiquated notions about the separation of church and state. Religion does have a place in policy, said one panelist--we just need to interpret ideas like ""under God"" in more universal terms. A group of women bloggers debated how to better incorporate issues of race into feminism. Thankfully, the convention didn't produce any white papers or party platforms. But it did reaffirm what it proved at the first Netroots Nation in 2006: The liberal online community is more than the sum of its bylines."	I attended every event at Netroots Nation 2009. Here's what I found.
20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/08/making_the_same_mistake_twice.html	"The Battle for America 2008 feels familiar--but not because it's about last year's election. Authors Dan Balz and Haynes Johnson report a lot of new behind-the-scenes details, so the story feels fresh. What feels familiar are the problems Sen. Obama faced on the campaign trail, which mirror the ones President Obama faces today in selling health care reform. Now that Barack Obama is president, it's easy to forget how tough it was for him at times during the presidential campaign, particularly during the primaries. It wasn't just that he was often behind in the polls. It's that he sometimes just wasn't very good. He stumbled in debates. He made distracting gaffes. Frequently professorial, he failed to connect with voters. These are the same criticisms we hear today. Obama talked to the authors about the messy process of finding his voice. ""I'm actually sort of a slow starter,"" he said. ""In those first couple of months I wasn't operating on this tight script. [I was] still sort of working out my riff."" On health care, it's clear that Obama is still working out his riff. He's been talking about the subject for months and yet the number of people who disapprove of his handling of the issue continues to rise. In several polls, people now disapprove of his performance more than they approve. He has pushed the idea that health care reform will not increase the deficit--to the exclusion of other arguments he might make--and yet the message is not getting through. In a recent Quinnipiac University poll, voters did not believe, by a margin of 72 percent to 21 percent, that Obama will keep his promise to overhaul the health care system without adding to the deficit. With Congress leaving Washington for the month of August, Obama says he is looking forward to getting the health care conversation out of the back rooms of Washington and into the country. He may be the only one. The conversation in the country sounds pretty ugly. It's distorted and full of misinformation as partisans from both sides try to whip up their troops. Town halls have turned into shouting matches, and they're likely to get worse as groups from the  left prepare to shout down the shouting groups from the right. There's even meta-shouting, as the left and right debate the authenticity of the various shouters. Whatever the outcome of that debate, this much we know: It's still shouting. If over the last several months, through congressional debates, presidential press conferences, and White House-sponsored town halls, people were unable to hear Obama's message, they're not likely to hear him any better now. The passages in Battle for America in which Obama promises to end the partisan rancor and bring a new way of doing business feel very distant in this period of bickering and spitting. There's a consensus both inside and outside the administration that Obama has to take control of this conversation. ""This is the most precarious time for this legislation,"" says former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle. ""The president's going to have to stay connected. He must communicate. He can't afford to lose one day."" The job, says Daschle, is to educate the American people and communicate with the lawmakers who have to defend health care reform back home. Obama needs to give members of Congress public cover--but also ammunition for their local battles. But how? Obama's first problem is that there isn't a single piece of legislation but, rather, five. He can pound on Republicans for delay, but the main holdup right now is the Senate finance committee, which is run by a Democrat. Congress left town having made progress, arguably historic progress, but the five remaining bills, all different, amount to thousands of pages. No wonder the public is confused. The president will continue to push his emphasis on ""health insurance consumer protections"" that will improve life for those who already have insurance. And he'll continue to emphasize that those who have insurance won't lose it. That's a tough sell. A recent CBS News/New York Times poll says that 69 percent worry that a government plan will affect the quality of their care. Almost three-quarters think it will limit their access. They also worry about the affect on the economy, with 81 percent saying it will lead to job cuts. In a Thursday meeting with the Senate Democratic caucus, the president's advisers also promised that the president and his aides would be going on the offensive in August. Obama's senior adviser, David Axelrod, and deputy chief of staff Jim Messina first emphasized how well the health-insurance consumer protections polled with voters, continuing the message shift away from focusing on the cost savings from reform. The White House aides also promised that the president and administration aides would be providing political cover for Democrats. That, according to one who was there, means increased attacks on Republicans and a continued effort to single out insurance companies. Does Obama's success in the campaign offer any lessons for his health care battle? There are lots of ways that being president is different from running a campaign--you have to deal with Congress, and you don't always have a ready-made opponent you can rally your supporters against. And you have to make deals you never would have contemplated while trying to court your party's activists. The New York Times reports, for example, that the White House made a deal with the drug lobby in an effort to sell health care reform. And in this debate, unlike in the campaign, Obama is not lucky in his opponents (though plenty of his allies think conservatives are overreaching by stirring up confrontation at the town halls of Democratic members of Congress). Republicans may be in bad shape now, but they're not as dysfunctional as the Clinton and McCain campaigns portrayed in the book. White House aides know they can't duplicate many of the stratagems of the campaign. They can't galvanize their supporters the way they could in the immediate post-Bush era--though they're trying. But what helped Obama the most during the campaign, Balz and Johnson show, was his ability to learn on the fly. They detail regular acts of self-assessment. There were several candid meetings in which Obama called on his team (and himself) to improve their performance: ""The New Hampshire loss revealed characteristics in Obama that served him well through the long campaign--his facility to stay calm under pressure, his capacity for self reflection, his willingness to take corrective action, his determination to keep his team focused."" The question is how Obama finds this focus, and his voice, on health care. Reading the passages of his stump speeches from the campaign immediately reminds you what's missing from the campaign to sell reform: the passion and the stories. ""I tend to be a storyteller,"" Obama tells the authors, explaining how he felt hemmed-in during the quick-answer debates. ""The aspirational aspects of my message are rooted in people's stories and stories about this country."" He's yet to find his story on health care. Pollster Stan Greenberg thinks this is a key to Obama's successful salesmanship of reform. ""The Congress can't win the country for health care reform,"" he says. ""It's got to be the president. He's the leader. ... You can't get there on analysis alone. You gotta get there on emotion."" One way Obama has been trying to recapture the emotion that made him so powerful during the campaign is to slip back into campaign mode. In New Jersey last month at the end of a campaign stop for Gov. John Corzine, he demonstrated some of the rallying fire he showed so regularly in the last two years. But while Obama knows what he's fighting against--gridlock, cynicism, lobbyists--he still has to wait for Congress to return in the fall and give him a bill he can fight for. He'll have to hope that by that time, the American people are still willing to listen."	Obama's missteps in the health care debate mirror his missteps in last year's campaign.
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/08/aok_street.html	"Even as the national economy struggles, one industry remains basically unaffected: lobbying. A handful of sectors, notably the oil and gas and health care industries, have been especially active despite the downturn. Others, such as real estate and finance, are spending less on lobbying. But overall, the decrease is small--and the influence of lobbyists has suffered no corresponding decline. Whatever the criticisms of Washington's influence-peddling industry--and there are many--it's hard to take issue with its efficiency. The financial sector offers the best example. Normally, industries spend on lobbying in direct proportion to how much relevant pending legislation there is (hence the uptick in health care and energy lobbying last quarter, as congressional committees wrestled over health insurance as well as cap-and-trade bills). Likewise, banks and investment firms saw the biggest regulatory overhaul in years handed down by the White House in June--and many observers say that the regulations are favorable to the financial industry. Yet the financial sector spent less--about 10 percent less!--on lobbying in the second quarter of 2009 than it did in the second quarter of 2008. An analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics finds that finance and credit companies spent $7.24 million in the second quarter this year, compared with $8.24 million last year. And while commercial banks spent slightly more on lobbying in that quarter than they did a year ago, their year-to-date totals have declined from $25.2 million to a flat $25 million. Why the slip? The obvious answer is that the sector has shrunk. Bear Stearns and Lehman Bros. no longer exist, Merrill Lynch was bought out, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are now commercial banks rather than investment banks. The economic downturn has squeezed balance sheets, prompting many banks to focus on paying off their TARP loans rather than lobbying Congress. Citigroup, for example, has spent only $3.1 million on lobbying so far this year--roughly a third of the $8.8 million it spent all of last year. (Although the crash hasn't stopped some of them.) It's also possible some banks are holding their fire for later in the year, when Congress takes a closer look at the president's proposal. But the dip in spending doesn't seem to have hurt lobbying performance at all. If anything, it's been the financial sector's most successful quarter in a long time. Sure, banks aren't happy about Obama giving regulatory power to the Federal Reserve, nor is the idea to create a Financial Services Oversight Council especially popular. But overall, Wall Street has been pleased with the president's proposed reforms. And it's only getting happier: The longer Congress takes debating health care and energy bills, the more the economy recovers, the more watered-down the regulatory legislation will likely be once it reaches the president's desk. Indeed, observers of K Street and Wall Street alike suggest that lobbying hasn't let up a bit. ""Just because the overall numbers may be down from where they were previously doesn't mean lobbying efforts have ceased by any stretch of the imagination,"" says Dave Levinthal of CRP. Ed Mierzwinski of the Public Interest Research Group says finance sector lobbyists are as active as ever. ""On the Hill, we have not noticed any decline in the drumbeat from the opponents of reform,"" he says. ""There may be fewer players, but the bankers, credit unions, they're still out there in a big, big way."" If less money plus more results equals greater efficiency, then perhaps the takeaway is that the financial crisis has made K Street more efficient. A dollar spent on lobbying has always been one of the best ways a company--and, in the aggregate, an industry--can expand its margins. But if the first half of 2009 is any indicator, that dollar just got even more profitable."	Is K Street getting more efficient?
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/07/beverage_profiling.html	"Sometimes a beer is just a beer--except in politics, where beer may signify any old thing we want it to. It is the most abused of all alcoholic beverages *. Since the early '70s, the typical voter has often been referred to as Joe Six-Pack. Beer made the cover of Newsweek magazine as part of a discussion of whether candidate Barack Obama (represented by a leaf of arugula) could connect with the common man (represented by a frosty mug). This was an extension of the political sorting technique of describing Democratic candidates who appeal to upscale voters as ""wine track"" candidates and those who appeal to blue-collar voters as being on the ""beer track."" George W. Bush, according to some, was a more appealing candidate than Al Gore because a poll showed that he was the candidate people would prefer to have a beer with. So what are we to make of President Obama's invitation to professor Henry Louis Gates and Sgt. James Crowley for a beer Thursday night at the White House? First, like the whole Gates-Crowley affair, this beer detente is another infusion in this summer's stimulus act for columnists (it's a bipartisan bill; Sarah Palin has done her part as well). The night is also a boon to headline writers: The Prof and Cop Hops Stop! Hot Heads Share a Frosty! Prof, Cop Quaff With Barack After Squawk. But is there any meaning to squeeze out of the choice of beverage? Serving sherry would not have been the right call. The president has already been accused of siding with the professor. So did he choose beer to compensate? During the campaign, when Obama was seen as the ""wine track"" candidate, he worked to correct that impression by having a beer in front of the cameras. During the campaign, the beer metaphor was sometimes apt--Obama did have trouble with white working-class voters--and sometimes highly imperfect. Obama beat Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin, arguably the most beer-sodden state: home of Schlitz, Miller and City Brewing, and birthplace of Pabst. The Bush-and-beer trope was even more imperfect. In the ""poll"" conducted by brewer Samuel Adams, Bush barely beat Gore (40 percent to 37 percent)--statistically, it was a tie. Plus, if Bush was the candidate people most wanted to have a beer with, wouldn't he have won the popular vote? (And then there's the theory that the majority on the Supreme Court was drinking beer when it ruled in Bush v. Gore, but that's another matter.) But the problems with this metaphor go even deeper. Beer may be the drink of the ""regular guy,"" but it is not only the drink of the regular guy. There is plenty of elitism in beer these days. The next time you're at Whole Foods, count how many seconds it takes before a man wearing a golf shirt, no socks, and loafers is standing beside you examining the shelves of expensive foreign and microbrewed beers. Wine, meanwhile, has been moving in the other direction, though of course there have always been bargain-basement brands: Thunderbird, MD 20/20, Night Train, and Boone's Farm. When Obama announced that he would have a Budweiser on Thursday night, it suggested he was going for the most regular-guy brand he could find. (It sells for about $6.50 for a six-pack.) But it turns out that the cop likes the same kind of fancy beer the professor does: He's having a Blue Moon, a Belgian-Style witbier  ($7 to $9 a six-pack), while Gates is having a Red Stripe ($7) or Becks ($8). Upon this affinity for upmarket beers may be built a towering reconciliation. The thing with beer is that it's about not class but diffusion. Obama wants to lessen tensions, so he's picked the drink of the backyard and the ballgame. Whether you light your grill by pressing a button or dumping a can of lighter fuel on briquettes, you probably have a beer nearby. If Thursday night's group therapy were playing out in any suburban American home, the next move after getting the beers would be for Obama to show the two men his new flat-screen TV. Beer is the antithesis of the strutting and overreacting that gripped all three male actors in this drama (unless you drink too much, and then it is the enabler of those impulses). ""Maybe it's a guy thing,"" said Wendy Murphy, lawyer for Lucia Whalen, explaining why her client--whose 911 call brought Crowley to Gates' house--was not invited to beer night. There is a rich history of beer at the White House. George Washington drank it after battle. Thomas Jefferson brewed it at Monticello. During Prohibition, ""Beer for Prosperity"" was the cry of those who saw repeal as a way to create jobs and raise taxes, and Franklin Roosevelt ran on that platform. At the 1932 Democratic National Convention, he pledged to end dry laws ""just as fast as the Lord will let us authorize the manufacture and sale of beer."" Eric Felten, author of How's Your Drink, says that when that happened, breweries delivered their first batches to the White House, where Eleanor Roosevelt had promised to have the newly legal beer served. During Nixon's first term, when political aide Chuck Colson was courting the Teamsters union, he invited a host of members for lunch in the White House mess. They ordered beer with their Mexican food and were served Michelob, which happened to be distributed by nonunion labor. Thirst triumphed over politics, however, and everyone imbibed. In entertaining Gates and Crowley, Obama will probably not be able to match Lyndon Johnson, who also used beer to break the ice in tense situations. Johnson used to take reporters on ""speed and beer"" drives on his ranch. He'd pop some cold ones and race off into the dust of the ranch. Obama can't do this, obviously--as spacious as the White House grounds are, they're no LBJ ranch--but even if he tried, Crowley would have to arrest him. And that's how this mess started in the first place. Correction, July 31, 2009: This article originally implied beer was a spirit. Technically a spirit is a liquid that has been distilled, whereas beer is produced by fermentation. ( Return to the corrected sentence.)"	Why Obama is serving beer to the professor and the police officer.
23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/07/community_college_organizer.html	"There's a joke among snooty Boston-area high-school kids: If they don't get good grades, they'll end up at Cape Cod Community College, or ""4 C's by the Sea."" In suburban Washington, D.C., the punch line is Maryland's Montgomery College, or ""M.K."" for short. Kids in Houston use San Jacinto College, long known as ""Harvard on the Highway."" Community colleges don't get a lot of respect. Except, as of this week, from President Obama. In a speech Tuesday in Warren, Mich., he proposed sinking nearly $12 billion into revamping the country's community-college system. The plan would provide $9 billion in grant money to boost academic programs and raise graduation rates, plus another $2.5 billion to upgrade school facilities. It would also fund open-source online courses so that schools don't have to build more classrooms to admit more students. The point isn't to turn Harvard on the Highway into actual Harvard. Even if the government gave all $12 billion to one community college, it wouldn't be as rich as the World's Greatest University. Nor is the purpose merely to improve the image of community colleges. And it's not to encourage enrollment: With the economy tanking and tuitions at four-year colleges and universities exploding, community colleges are in the rare position of having to turn people away. ""We're bursting at the seams,"" says Gail Mellow, president of LaGuardia Community College in New York City, which saw a 25 percent increase in students over last year. Rather, the plan is designed to correct decades of federal neglect. ""Too often, community colleges are treated like an afterthought--if they're thought of at all,"" Obama said in his speech. Right now, somewhere between one-third and one-half of American undergrads are at community colleges, depending how you count. Yet community colleges receive only 20 percent of federal funding. ""We've been so focused on the quality and reputation of our lead institutions"" at the expense of community colleges, says Thomas Bailey of the Community College Research Center at Columbia University. (That's right: Not even the community college research center is based at a community college.) ""The biggest issue in higher education has been affirmative action."" Racial preference isn't a problem when you don't turn anyone away. That model is outdated, says Mellow: ""We live in a knowledge economy, and we've set up education as if we're an agrarian culture."" It used to be that you could educate the top 10 percent, he said, and the rest of the population would get unskilled jobs. But in a global economy, where even professions like cashier or truck driver require constant upgrades in technology and information, a high-school diploma is not always enough. That said, a pricey Ivy League degree may not be necessary, either. Community colleges fill that hole. If the goal is to raise college graduation rates--Obama wants 5 million more grads by 2020--community colleges make an obvious target. They're packed with people who want to be in college--they enrolled, after all--but often drop out. (Only 30 percent of students entering community college graduate in six years, compared with 58 percent of students at four-year schools.) Plus, they require little funding compared with other universities: Community college tuitions are typically in the $2,000-to-$5,000 range. Another reason to spend on community colleges: They're agile. If the university system is an ocean liner, community colleges are the speedboats of higher education. If they get more money and use it wisely, the thinking goes, they can produce results in a matter of years. After all, they're designed to respond to the needs of the local community. For example, LaGuardia Community College recently introduced a program to train designers in New York City. When the fishing industry started struggling in Massachusetts, Cape Cod Community College turned its focus to nursing and other health-care-related jobs. When Connecticut introduced its first casino, one nearby community college started training croupiers. For an administration looking for shovel-ready projects, community colleges can provide a lot of shovels. Will $12 billion really make a difference? ""We'd hope so,"" says Elizabeth Homan, a spokeswoman for Montgomery College. The school currently has $78 million in deferred maintenance and hasn't hired any new faculty in two years. Obama's plan might not cover the needs of all 1,100 community colleges in the country. But the national attention will probably help the schools raise more money on their own. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation last year announced up to $500 million in grants to community colleges. Educators also hope Obama's new focus will change the way people think about post-secondary education. Giant research universities increase the amount of knowledge in the world. But community colleges increase the number of people who know it. And with jobs going overseas at ever-faster rates, America needs an educated, flexible work force ready to change jobs on short notice. That work force is more likely to emerge from community colleges than from, say, the Dartmouth English department."	Why Barack Obama thinks community colleges are the key to fixing higher education.
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/07/hot_air_rising.html	"Barbara Boxer and Jim Inhofe are one of the Senate's oddest couples. She drives a Prius. He drives a Hummer. She thinks climate change is an urgent problem. He thinks global warming is a hoax. She represents a state that went for Obama by 23 percentage points. His was the only state where John McCain won every county. Yet the California Democrat and the Oklahoma Republican, chairman and former chairman, sit side-by-side on the environment and public works committee, which on Tuesday held its first hearing on climate-change legislation. With an unusually high senatorial turnout and a line of spectators that stretched down the hall--complete with activists dressed in muscle suits, urging senators to ""beef up"" the bill--Boxer and Inhofe drew their lines in the sand. From a legislative standpoint, the hearing was next to useless. But as a piece of political theater, it might have earned a Tony. ""Today I expect you will hear fierce words of doubt and fear,"" Boxer said in her opening statement. ""This is consistent with a pattern of 'No, we can't; no, we won't.' "" Inhofe wanted none of it. ""However you spin the debate, whatever schemes you concoct, the public will find out, and when they do, they will reject the schemes, and they will reject the spin,"" he said, characterizing the House's version of climate legislation as the ""largest tax increase in American history."" Boxer turned to face him. ""Senator, thank you for your constructive words,"" she said. She then proceeded to point out that the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill contains no tax increases but in fact includes tax credits. ""In the event that after every statement, you want to review, then we should have the chance to do the same thing,"" Inhofe grumbled. ""That's fair,"" Boxer replied sweetly. ""I don't mind if you want to review."" ""Oh, OK,"" he said, to titters in the audience, before explaining why he thinks the bill is indeed a tax: Consumers will have higher energy bills as companies pay more for the privilege to pollute. There was a slight pause. ""I stand by my comments,"" Boxer said, before calling the line of senators to speak. By now, climate legislation is a worn and dusty battleground. Only last summer, the Senate had a knock-down fight over another climate bill, Lieberman-Warner, which perished during a hot summer in which gas prices hit $4 a gallon. This time, senators are working from the whopper of a bill that Speaker Nancy Pelosi cracked skulls to get through the House with only seven votes to spare. For now, it's all on Boxer as she leads the effort to neutralize the forces of denial and send a bill to Congress by the end of the month. The first day of hearings featured no fewer than four Cabinet members, who spoke of sequestration, soil tillage, and parts per million. But at this point the issues aren't really at issue. Yesterday was a time for showy opening salvos. ""Given the problem of global warming as you see it, do you agree that this committee should do its job and move forward with a climate-change/green-jobs bill?"" Boxer asked a panel of administration officials. Steven Chu (Energy), Lisa Jackson (EPA), Tom Vilsack (Agriculture), and Ken Salazar (Interior) all nodded. Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey also had a ""question."" There are 62 million more cars on the road in America now than in 1990, he observed. ""Could that cause air quality problems for us?"" ""Absolutely,"" answered Jackson. ""Good,"" the senator replied. ""I wasn't sure."" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island skipped the rhetorical questions, opting instead for a straight declarative. ""This is the last place, other than the ExxonMobil boardroom, where sober people debate that global warming is real,"" he said. Republicans went for theater as well as rhetoric--complete with props. Sen. Kit Bond of Missouri had an aide pile a stack of paper on the table next to him as he spoke, representing the drafts, amendments, and reports that went into the final House bill, until they towered over his head. And then, the finale: a blown-up diagram of Waxman-Markey, borrowed from House Minority Leader John Boehner's assault on the legislation, in lurid blue and yellow. ""What needles are the majority trying to hide in the haystack?"" Bond asked. ""What backroom deals were made to buy support?"" After two hours, the senators had to break to be present for the swearing in of their new colleague Al Franken. Because of schedule conflicts, only Inhofe and John Barrasso of Wyoming returned to hear from Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi, with whom they had an amiable chat about the catastrophic economic effects of cap-and-trade legislation. After that, it was Boxer's turn to toss softballs at a panelist atypical for such events: John Fetterman, mayor of the town of Braddock, Pa. Clad in a black Dickies shirt and steelworker boots, he had tattoos up and down both forearms--one of Braddock's ZIP code and the others etching out the dates of homicides in his home community (none yet this year). Fetterman has latched onto cap-and-trade legislation as a way to replace the jobs his city lost from the demise of American manufacturing. And he's trying to bring his constituents along. Initially, he said, many of them saw environmentalists as ""tree-huggers"" and ""thought you all wear Patagonia and drive Subarus,"" he told Boxer. Now, he said, he emphasizes that ""there are 250 tons of steel in a windmill."" By this time, Boxer and Fetterman pretty much had the room to themselves, aside from the mayor's entourage: a small flock of young African-American kids who are working on the first ""green roof"" in the Monongahela Valley. They were props, too, though they probably didn't realize it. It was their first time in Washington, and, unlike the grandstanding senators, they said nothing."

She made her surprise announcement on the day before a national holiday--a day reserved for news of impending investigations, affairs, or habits that need treatment. In a rambling press conference, the Alaska governor never really explained why this day was better than all other days. If she'd waited three days, she would have owned the news cycle. Perhaps she was declaring early independence? The larger reason for Palin's early departure was that she was having no fun. Ever since she returned to Alaska from the national stage, being governor has been a chore. Her political opponents have launched 15 ethics charges against her. The state economy has turned sour, and she got into an ugly squabble over federal stimulus funds. It's much more enjoyable to travel the country waving to adoring crowds of GOP activists. So Palin decided to chuck her office for the limelight.
She can now tour the country as the only superstar in a party that desperately needs one. Because she can pack bleachers, she can raise money. In addition to boosting party morale and filling its coffers (and her own), she can build relationships nationwide that will be crucial if she really is interested in running for national office again. The downsides for this gambit are obvious. Being governor was the best rebuttal she had to charges that she lacked depth and executive experience. In her news conference, she said the attacks had forced her to leave, but it was her toughness fighting the ""old boys network,"" as she used to call it, that used to be her primary selling point during the campaign. Maybe she's just being mavericky? Perhaps. That's certainly how she framed her departure. To stay in office as a lame duck would have been to do the predictable thing, she said. But the challenge for Palin in the 2008 presidential campaign and again now is persuading voters that her maverick instinct isn't just unpredictability and erratic behavior--qualities that can turn maverick-ness into a liability. Only dead fish go with the flow, she said, in what was a welcome addition to the political phrase book. But if you're not swimming with the current, your options are still tough ones: Either you're swimming upstream, or you're flapping around on the dock. Sarah Palin announces her resignation:"	Sarah Palin picked the wrong day to resign as governor of Alaska.
26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/06/mr_president_iran_has_a_question.html	There was a tiny tempest this week in the Washington press corps. The White House arranged to have Nico Pitney of the Huffington Post ask a question he received over the Web from an Iranian. This caused mild upset among some traditional news organizations, which, in turn, prompted harsh derision from many in the Web-only world. (On Sunday, the tempest became a fracas on CNN's media-affairs show Reliable Sources as Pitney traded accusations with the Washington Post's Dana Milbank.) This is an intramural fight that won't go away. We love to talk about ourselves. (If you think this is navel-gazing, move on or close your browser. If you do read on, don't say you weren't warned, and don't complain.) Beyond the media world, this small fracas is interesting because it's a predictable clash between various media outlets in a swiftly changing world. Pitney is a new kind of journalist not just because he works for a Web site but because on the Iran story, he's been a first-rate aggregator--sifting all different kinds of media for the narrative of an ongoing story. This is an entirely new kind of animal, available not just at the Huffington Post but at the  New York Times. What's new about this little press conference episode is not the arrangement but the context. The White House arranges things all the time with reporters. It just doesn't usually happen during a press conference. (The Jeff Gannon incident  was the exception that proves the rule.) In a better world, reporters would not rely on the White House for access to the president. But we do. The administration decides who gets called on and who gets sit-down interviews and who gets all-day access complete with a trip to a hamburger joint with the president. So there's nothing new about a reporter getting a choice piece of access because there's something in it for the White House. In the Bush years, the mere notion that reporters would engage in any kind of arranging at all was a cause for criticism. The argument was that reporters were captive because they relied on the White House to allow them even in the door to do their jobs. I remember being on a panel with Arianna Huffington, who argued persuasively that because the White House press corps relied on access, the transaction between it and the White House was inherently tainted. (She wrote an account of that panel.) There was, and is, merit to this charge. Reporters and news organizations have, at times, traded away toughness for access. But access does not guarantee softness. Pitney got his shot and asked a good question, proof of which is that the president fled from it. (Further proof is that Obama started his answer with the word well--a little tic that tells you he's not so enthusiastic.) Now Arianna Huffington and her defenders are on the other side of this intramural spat. They are arguing a version of what the mainstream media used to argue: It's not the access; it's what you do with it. That's a healthy evolution. It's true that some of the same writers now praising the Obama administration for its openness to a new kind of journalism would probably have howled in protest if Bush had done something similar at a press conference. How much this hypocrisy bothers you probably depends on how partisan you are. But what's truly silly is pretending the arrangement doesn't exist. This is either a delusion or a strained rationale the mainstream media use to justify its choice access. Fear of losing that access, by the way, isn't necessarily selfish sour grapes: Mainstream media outlets pay a lot of money to cover the White House, and the information they provide (presumably) is a public good. For this expenditure of money and resources, they might argue, they should receive some preferential treatment. If they don't get at least pride of place in the Q&A pecking order at a press conference, they'll go away--and we'll all suffer. (The counterargument is that they get plenty of access.) There are members of the traditional press who concede that there is a symbiotic relationship between the White House and its press corps--but they're still bothered by this episode because it took place at a press conference, which turned the other reporters into props. Pitney's question helped create a tableau that benefited the White House on this specific story: A president who was being criticized for insufficient fellow-feeling with Iranian protesters got a chance to show that he was making a special effort to field a question from an Iranian. After all, the president could have answered Pitney's questions in private. But he wanted to show his empathy to the world, and to create this tableau, he needed the Huffington Post to agree to this arrangement. As an enabling of tableaux, however, this was puny compared with the tableau created by the recent ABC and NBC specials, which were longer and reached far more people than the press conference. If the president had sat down with Pitney, the mainstream press wouldn't have minded so much. They cared, in part, because the episode made them participants. The White House used the press conference stage for the arrangement. As a civilian, how upset you are about this depends on how much importance you give White House press conferences. There is a school of thought that nothing much useful comes out of presidential press conferences. I disagree. They may be staged events--the president picks the questioners, and they're held on his turf, usually--but they are among the least staged interactions between the president and the press. While the Obama team has meddled in press conferences in a new way, it's also made them less planned. Obama calls on a wider range of reporters than the Bush team did--reporters from Web sites, reporters from smaller magazines, Stars and Stripes--and those questions are likely to be more unpredictable, which is good. On balance, then, this White House has actually made the press conference more likely to generate useful news. Finally, a personal perspective on the members of the White House press corps: For a lot of them, the press conference is the only place where they get a crack at the president. The White House beat can make stars out of network TV correspondents and big-city newspaper reporters, but there are a lot of other members of the press corps you've never heard of and probably never will. There are fewer of these types now, because these are the people losing their jobs as the media contract. Press conferences are often their one chance to ask a question of a president they've watched and studied for months. They prepare their questions, remind themselves of the last time someone from an obscure outlet got called on, and hope they get their shot. Then they watch as the traditional big-media outlets get their questions, and when it all ends yet again without them being able to ask anything, they're disappointed. Now, as they are moved farther to the back of the room, they have one more reason to be disappointed. Even if you buy the White House's rationale, you can appreciate how they may find this new arrangement hard to take.	How Obama is using the media to destroy and improve the traditional press conference.
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/06/sanfords_spiritual_giant.html	"Near the end of South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford's jarringly open confessional press conference Wednesday, as the event deteriorated into a storm of questions, interruptions, and half-answers, Sanford paused to give a shout-out. ""I see Cubby Culbertson in the back of the room,"" Sanford said. ""I would consider him a spiritual giant."" Someone tried to interrupt him, but Sanford pressed on: ""And an incredibly dear friend. And he has been helping us work through this over these last five months. And Cubby, I want to say thank you for being there as a friend."" So, who is this spiritual giant who for five months has been advising the governor? Warren ""Cubby"" Culbertson is a pillar of the Christian community in South Carolina's capital, a Bible study leader and Sunday school teacher who owns a court reporting business. Culbertson helped form a men's Bible study group with the help of good friend Bill Jones, the president of the evangelical college Columbia International University. (A collection of ""Cubby's Talks"" can be found here.) The group, called the Round Table, meets weekly in Culbertson's Columbia office. For about eight years, it has attracted some of Columbia's top professionals, including, briefly, Sanford. Sanford attended the Round Table meetings twice in the last few years, and as a result of those meetings, Culbertson became a part of Sanford's life in a ""counselor"" capacity, according to another of the group's founding members, Columbia attorney Bill Short. But he's a longtime supporter of the politician. In 1998, years before the Round Table held its first meeting, Culbertson donated $250 to the Sanford for Congress campaign, according to campaign records. Culbertson is also an occasional teacher at Christ Church of the Carolinas. His podcasts on the Book of James are available online.

28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/06/appalled_and_outraged.html	"I will not begin a piece with a pretentious literary quote. Meanwhile, F. Scott Fitzgerald observed that the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function. By this measure, President Obama was first-rate at his press conference Tuesday afternoon. He escalated his rhetoric about the violence in Iran but insisted he hadn't changed his posture. He claimed to be outside the 24-hour news cycle while simultaneously manipulating it. Obama's supporters will call this performance evidence of an admirably supple mind. His detractors will call it slipperiness. The president started the press conference with his strongest denunciation of the violence in Iran to date. In his opening remarks, he said the United States was ""appalled and outraged"" and that ""we deplore the violence against innocent civilians."" Switching to the first person, he continued, ""I strongly condemn these unjust actions, and I join with the American people in mourning each and every innocent life that is lost."" This is the strong stuff the president's critics have been calling for. In the nine days since the government of Iran started cracking down on its people, Obama has been reluctant, arguing that if he meddled, he would become a foil for the authoritarian regime. In response to the beatings and shootings in the street, he said he was ""deeply troubled"" and ""concerned,"" but no more. This weekend he called on the Iranian authorities to stop the violence, but his language contained no new admonition. Today, he not only upped his rhetoric, he reacted personally, talking about the ""searing image of a woman bleeding to death in the streets,"" a reference to the so-called Neda video. He called the loss ""extraordinarily painful"" and ""heartbreaking."" In recent days, Obama has quoted the expression Martin Luther King Jr. made popular: ""The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice."" When he cited this quote during his presidential campaign, he asked voters to put their hand on the arc to help it bend. Until now he has said the United States stood ""witness"" to the events in Iran. Now he has put his hand on the arc. Why the change? The president bristled at the mere suggestion that it was a change. Yet his press secretary had gone on the morning news shows to preview Obama's new ""stern words,"" the White House had them translated into Persian, and still the president maintained that he'd said nothing new. ""I've been consistent all along,"" he said. It's true that he reiterated his previous noninterventionist position--he did not challenge the legitimacy of the election or withdraw his offer to engage with Iranian leaders. But the language was new. Obama laughed at the notion that his critics like John McCain had pushed him into a stronger position. ""I just made a statement on Saturday in which we said we deplore the violence,"" he said. But the president's statement on Saturday contains no such tough language. The president also answered several health care questions. He made it very clear, as he always has, that he wants Congress to present him with a plan that doesn't increase the deficit. ""This is legislation that must and will be paid for,"" he said. He repeatedly returned to this point, perhaps an acknowledgement of the public's fears about growing deficits. Obama has long said that if people are happy with their current health insurance, nothing will change--thus making the profound reform he advocates seem less threatening. He clarified this during the press conference: What he meant, he said, was that the government would not actively change your plan. Your plan may well change under his reforms, he suggested, but he argued that this would happen anyway--even if nothing was done. This led into his larger health care pitch, that the current system is unsustainable: ""Unless we fix what's broken in our current system, everyone's health care will be in jeopardy. For fans of a public insurance option, the president offered partial hope. He said he wants a public plan and made the case for it on the merits, arguing that such an option would provide competition that would lower costs and expand coverage. It was a legitimate defense, but he refused to say he would veto any bill that lacked a public option. (That may well turn out to be smart tactical flexibility, not a sign of a weakened position.) At one point in the back-and-forth with reporters over Iran, the president said, ""I know everybody here is on a 24-hour news cycle. I'm not. OK?"" It was a good line. He has used a version of it in a previous press conference. But while the president doesn't like the demands of the news cycle, he knows just how to feed it. When outrage over AIG bonuses gripped the news cycle, he appeared before cameras to channel it. When Sonia Sotomayor's remarks about being a ""wise Latina"" caused controversy, Obama and his team knew it was better to say she misspoke than to keep arguing that she'd been taken out of context. During his campaign, Obama scrapped his opposition to wearing a flag pin for the same reasons. By modifying his position or habits a little, Obama feeds the news beast and the overheated controversy goes away. In some ways the president is the 24-hour news cycle. He's everywhere--cable, sports channels, and late-night talk shows. He'll be on ABC tomorrow talking about health care. At the press conference he showed just how attuned he is to the rapacious news environment.  He called on the Huffington Post's Nico Pitney, who has been following the Iran story closely, and asked him to relay one of the questions he'd gotten from one of the Iranian protesters. * The White House had called Pitney that morning to invite him over to ask the question, an act of stagecraft for which the previous president would have been excoriated by his critics. Obama sparred and joked with the press in a commanding performance that should once and for all quiet the oddly persistent jibes about his use of a teleprompter. He grew irritated at times with the constant Iran questioning, but he was particularly bothered in response to a question about his smoking habits. He appeared beleaguered at having to answer a ""human interest"" question but then did so rather completely, admitting that he's 95 percent cured but has occasional lapses. He sparred with ABC's Jake Tapper over health care but made it clear he was listening carefully and even enjoying the back-and-forth. ""You're pitching, and I'm catching,"" said the president. He did not, in this case, claim that he could do both. Watch video of President Obama's June 23 news conference. Correction,  June 24, 2009: This article orginally misspelled Nico Pitney's name. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"	Is Obama getting tougher on Iran?
29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2009/06/the_honeymoon_is_not_over.html	"A good test of whether a marriage is still in the honeymoon phase is how accepting one spouse is of the other's irritating qualities. When a husband interrupts a wife in front of others and she thinks nothing of it, they're still honeymooners. When the same behavior initiates a kick under the table, the honeymoon is over, or at least imperiled. Fork in the thigh, forget it. The public's honeymoon with President Obama continues, despite a recent set of polls that show some warning signs. People don't approve of his handling of the economy as much they once did, and a majority worry he doesn't have a plan to tackle the deficit. They don't like his bailouts of the car companies at all. Despite these findings, he remains personally popular, and his approval rating is pretty steady and better than it was for the last two presidents at this stage in their tenure. In the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, his favorable/unfavorable numbers are 60 percent to 29 percent, and three-quarters like him, including 27 percent who don't agree with his policies. This is not new. Polls have shown this split between Obama's popularity and his policies for months. They've also shown Obama's weakness in these policy areas. Since March, a variety of polls show that Obama has underpolled his popularity on the question of the deficit or his budget plans by roughly 15 points. In the April Gallup poll, 44 percent disapproved of his handling of the deficit, an almost statistically insignificant difference from the 48 percent who disapprove of his handling today. What these numbers do help us figure out, though, is how well Obama can persuade on tough issues. He's known as a great communicator. His speeches may be powerful enough to settle colicky babies. The president and his aides also know how to narrow-cast their messages--using everything from town halls to TheLate Show to the network news to make sure different audiences get the message. Now, however, Obama is entering a rocky part of his schedule. For weeks, the president has been slowly transitioning from the first phase of his presidency, in which he was reacting to the problems he inherited, to the second, in which he's pushing the programs he campaigned on. He does not have the same power of emergency, and his opponents have a better sense of his weak spots. This makes the act of persuasion harder. Yet there are many areas in which Obama has been persuasive. Despite considerable criticism from Republicans and conservatives like Dick Cheney over his anti-terrorism policies and his foreign policy, a recent CBS/New York Times poll showed that the president's handling of foreign policy finds favor with 59 percent of Americans. Some 57 percent favor his handling of terrorism issues. Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor seems to be in a better position with the country than nominee Samuel Alito was at the same time (though this has a lot to do with Sotomayor's own qualifications, of course, and not just the president's powers to persuade). Other issues are harder for the president. A majority of people disapprove of the president's decision to close the military prison at Guantanamo Bay. People also don't like his plans for rescuing Chrysler and GM. Almost seven in 10 have serious reservations about the government's ownership of GM, according to the NBC/WSJ poll. Maybe Obama hasn't made a concerted effort to sell his policies on GM and Gitmo. There are two issues, however, that he has--and the results are not encouraging. Since the start of his presidency, Obama and his aides have been trying to address people's fears about the deficit. He's held numerous events highlighting his deficit-reduction plans, including one last week promoting stronger fiscal safeguards. He's also made deficit reduction the central theme of his health care reform pitch. People don't appear to have heard. In the CBS/New York Times poll, 60 percent said they didn't think the president has a plan for addressing the deficit. It's not that they don't like his plan--they don't even think he has one. The president has also tried to convince people that his stimulus bill has been working. The message hasn't gotten through, either. His claim that 150,000 jobs have been saved or created has been panned by the press, factcheck.org, and analysts, and the public doesn't seem to be buying it, either. In the CBS poll, 63 percent say Obama's policies have either had no impact on the economy or made it worse. In terms of voters (as opposed to issues), the biggest general problem for Obama in the numbers comes among the independents. After the 2008 election, they are now at their highest level in the electorate in 70 years, and they are moving away from him. In the NBC/WSJ survey, 46 percent of independents approve of Obama's handling of his job, which is down from 60 percent in April. In the CBS/New York Times poll, 65 percent thought Obama lacked a plan for the deficit. What do these findings suggest for the president's ability to sell his health care reform package? It's a big and complicated issue with a lot of entry points for demagoguery. (Rationing! Socialized medicine! Budget buster!) If Republicans frame the debate around its cost, they might be able to exploit people's hard-to-change views about the deficit. That's why administration officials insist that the health care plan will not increase the deficit and why members of Congress working on the plan have delayed its release until they can find a way to make the program deficit-neutral. The president has the wind at his back. Sixty-one percent want some kind of change in health care, and only 35 percent don't, according to a new Kaiser Family Foundation poll. A recent Pew poll shows 75 percent want to change the system to cover everyone. Some elements of reform are even more popular, like a public option, which 65 percent favor. Other proposals are not popular. Sixty-five percent oppose taxing employer health benefits, an idea under serious consideration because it helps offset new spending. Perhaps the most interesting element of the Kaiser poll is that persuasion matters. Of the 28 percent who oppose requiring employers to pay for health insurance, three-quarters are open to changing their minds if they are convinced it would be fairer. Tell the nearly 70 percent who favor such a mandate that it'll cause job losses, and 65 percent of them will flip. This seems to echo a similar volatility in the findings of former Clinton pollster Stanley Greenberg, who writes in the New Republic that the country is divided evenly on whether the greater risk is an unchanged status quo or government reforms that ""create new problems."" On health care, then--as on so many other issues--the lines of debate are familiar: The opposition will claim that the president's plan will create new problems. The president will try to convince the country that the status quo is unacceptable. The winner will be the side that the public decides not to kick in the shins."	Obama's challenge: get the public to like his policies as much as it likes him.
