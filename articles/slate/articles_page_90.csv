A governor's right to do the same is also quite sweeping in most states, though subject to a few restrictions. Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour discovered that this week when a judge blocked the release of 21 of the 200-odd inmates he had pardoned in his final days in office, 14 of whom were convicted murderers. (The reason: Some of the inmates did not give the required amount of public notice that they were seeking a pardon.) The theory behind executive pardons and commutations is that the letter of the law sometimes conflicts with human decency. For instance, Barbour himself was hailed a year ago by NAACP President Benjamin Jealous as a ""shining example of how governors should use their commutation powers"" after he lifted the life sentences of two sisters who had already served 16 years for robbing someone of $11. In the words of former Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, a presidential pardon amounts to ""the determination of the ultimate authority that the public welfare will be better served by inflicting less than what the judgment fixed."" But we members of the public do not always see how our welfare is being served by releasing convicted swindlers and killers into our midst. On those occasions, we call upon the ultimate authority for some explanation of his or her wisdom. Presidents and governors don't always deign to answer our calls, nor are they required to do so. But when they do choose to speak out, they give us a window into the various rationales for granting a pardon. Barbour, for one, issued a brief statement saying the ""pardons were intended to allow [the convicts] to find gainful employment or acquire professional licenses as well as hunt and vote."" Below is a rundown of what America's most notable pardoners have said--and what they really meant. Thomas Jefferson What he said: The laws under which these men were convicted were unjust and unconstitutional. What he meant: The laws under which these men were convicted were unjust and unconstitutional. Also, these men are my political allies. Upon his election in 1800, Jefferson pardoned all 10 men who remained in prison under the Alien and Sedition Acts, a set of laws passed by his predecessor John Adams in a bid to quell Democratic-Republicans' opposition to his undeclared war with France. Jefferson, a Democratic-Republican, disapproved of the laws on free-speech grounds. But he wasn't above the idea of prosecuting a few members of the press. Andrew Johnson What he said: These pardons are necessary in order to restore peace, order, and freedom to the country. What he meant: We don't have the prison space for all these people. In 1863, as it became clear the Union had the upper hand in the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln made plans to grant amnesty to rebel soldiers as part of a peace deal. His successor, Andrew Johnson, followed through on this promise in 1865, despite opposition from the ""Radical Republicans"" in Congress, who thought he was going too easy on the South. Gerald Ford What he said: Putting this man on trial would be politically divisive. What he meant: This man just handed me the presidency of the United States. A month after resigning the presidency, Richard Nixon faced indictment on charges of obstructing justice in the Watergate scandal. His successor, Gerald Ford, put the kibosh on that notion by issuing a pre-emptive pardon. ""The tranquility to which this nation has been restored by the events of recent weeks could be irreparably lost by the prospects of bringing to trial a former president of the United States,"" he explained. George H.W. Bush What he said: This man is a true American patriot. What he meant: I might have been complicit in this man's crimes. The first President Bush came under heavy criticism at the end of his first and only term in 1992 for pardoning former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who was about to go on trial for lying to Congress about the Iran-Contra affair. Bush said at the time that he felt the trial would amount to a ""criminalization of policy differences."" Of course, the fact that Bush himself had been vice president at the time of Iran-Contra might have influenced his thinking a bit. Among those left unconvinced was incoming President Bill Clinton, who declared himself concerned by the implication that ""not telling the truth to Congress under oath is somehow less serious than not telling the truth to some other body under oath."" Bill Clinton What he said: This man contributes to worthy causes. What he meant: This man's ex-wife contributed to Hillary's campaign. Clinton offered this as the most important of eight reasons why he pardoned Marc Rich, who had skirted charges of illegal oil deals with Iran by settling in Switzerland. Noting Rich's donations to Israeli charities and contributions to the peace process, Clinton averred that ""foreign policy considerations"" militated in Rich's favor. The pardon, he added, had nothing at all to do with the fact that Rich's former wife had contributed heavily to Hillary Clinton's senatorial campaign and the Clinton Presidential Library. Haley Barbour What he said: The state parole board agrees with 90 percent of these pardons. What he meant: The parole board agrees with 90 percent of these pardons. And the other 10 percent worked for me. The backlash to Barbour's pardons began when the families of some murder victims learned that their killers had been released from life sentences. Among the first to go free were four men who had worked as ""trusties""--domestic servants, essentially--in the governor's mansion. Barbour's rationale here is far from unusual--rather, he's following a long tradition of politicians capping off their final terms by pardoning people they know personally. Outrage over this practice prompted George W. Bush to refrain from considering personal appeals, instead relying on recommendations by the Office of the Pardon Attorney. But for a prisoner in Mississippi, it seems that your best chance to score a pardon was to get chummy with the man in charge."	The Real Reasons Political Leaders Grant Pardons

Bush's first 20 prisoners arrived at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. They were, we were promised at the time, ""the worst of the worst."" Eventually the camp came to house almost 800 prisoners, of whom 171 still remain. Some of them were tortured, some may be tried by military commission, and some have died or will die there. The 10-year anniversary was marked today by protests, articles, editorials, letters, personal remembrances, and reminders that Guantanamo itself is only part of the problem with Guantanamo. In the foreign press they are saying that the camp ""weighs heavily on America's conscience"" and that ""the shame of Guantanamo remains."" But most Americans are experiencing the anniversary without much conscience or shame; just with the same sense of inevitability and invisibility that has pervaded the entire 10-year existence of the camp itself: inevitability in that we somehow believe the camp was truly necessary and nobody ever really expects the conflict to be resolved; and invisibility in that nobody really knows what's happening there, or why. So while the rest of the world experiences this day in terms of how the United States ever got itself into this situation and what it's all done to America's reputation abroad, here in the United States the discourse is confined to how we will continue to live with it and why. The paradox of Guantanamo has always been that it's been invisible to so many Americans, and yet the only thing the rest of the world sees. The whole point of the prison camp there was to create a legal black hole. We've fished our wish: The world sees only blackness; we see only a hole. That's always been the challenge of Guantanamo: making it seem real to Americans who have tended to think of the Cuban camp as the potted palm in the war on terror. And it's very difficult to get exercised over a potted palm. From the perspective of a legal journalist, the real tragedy of this anniversary lies not in all the waste, and error, and gratuitous suffering. The tragedy even transcends the politics and the posturing and the will of the people to do nothing beyond shrugging that, well, mistakes were made. The real tragedy is that when the president and Congress failed to understand what had happened at Guantanamo Bay, the courts stepped in. The Supreme Court's 2008 ruling in Boumediene, holding that the prisoners at Guantanamo who were not American citizens still had the right of habeas corpus, represented the court doing precisely what it was built to do: remind the will of the people that sometimes it is full of shit. But since Boumediene, the court has taken itself out of the shining beacon of justice business and left the administration of those habeas corpus proceedings to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. That court has systematically thrown the whole habeas process through a wood chipper until it's not clear that there is anything left of the promise of Boumediene, beyond a command that some prisoners are due some due process to be named by someone sometime later. This fact was noted in a dissent by Judge David Tatel in a recently declassified decision regarding a Guantanamo detainee, Adnan Farhan Abdul Latif. Latif is a citizen of Yemen who has been held at Guantanamo since 2002. In October the three-judge appellate panel ruled 2-1 that a district court had erred in ordering Latif's release from the prison. There is much that is worrisome about the majority ruling in Latif, which Adam Liptak described recently as the ""next great Guantanamo case--whether the Supreme Court agrees to hear it or not."" As Liptak wrote: ""If the justices agree to hear the Latif case, they can explain whether their Guantanamo decisions were theoretical tussles about the scope of executive power fit for a law school seminar or whether they were meant to have practical consequences for actual prisoners. If the Supreme Court turns down the case, it will be signaling that it has given up on Guantanamo."" But in the spirit of the day, I urge you to stop for a moment and look at the decision itself, so heavily redacted that page after page is blacked out completely. The court, in evaluating a secret report on Latif, can tell us very little about the report and thus the whole opinion becomes an exercise in advanced Kafka: The dissent, for instance notes that ""As this court acknowledges, ""the [district] court cited problems with the report itself including [REDACTED]. ... And according to the report there is too high a [REDACTED] in the report for it to have resulted from [REDACTED]."" Liptak describes all this as an exercise in ""Mad Libs, Gitmo Edition."" But in the end, it's also an exercise in turning the legal process of assessing the claims of these prisoners at Guantanamo Bay into something that replaces one legal black hole with another: pages and pages of black lines that obscure in words what has been obscured in fact. Americans will never know or care what was done at the camp and why if the legal process that might have transparently corrected errors happens behind blacked-out pages. It's hard to say anything new about 10 full years of Guantanamo, beyond the fact that most of what we wrote two, four, and seven years ago still holds mostly true. But given that Americans have an increasingly hard time thinking about the camp, and the rest of the world can think about little else, perhaps we can agree that pretending it isn't there probably isn't the answer."	What We Might Want To Remember About Forgetting on the 10th Anniversary of the Prison Camp at Guantanamo
2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/01/romney_s_new_hampshire_victory_will_it_silence_his_conservative_critics_.html	"For the last week, Mitt Romney has called himself ""landslide Romney,"" repeating a joke from John McCain about his eight-vote victory in the Iowa caucuses. The title fits a little better now. He won the New Hampshire primary by a handy 16 points with 39 percent of the vote. In the much-watched fight for runner-up, Ron Paul got that ""real nice second place"" he'd been predicting, with 23 percent of the vote, and Jon Huntsman finished third with 17 percent--to the disappointment of New York magazine editors but few Republican voters. [Updated 11 a.m., Jan. 11.] Mitt Romney has been an anemic candidate, ahead in the polls but not strong enough to lock up victory. Will New Hampshire put some iron in the blood, or is it a pale win that won't quell conservative calls for a nominee they can believe in? Romney is now the first nonincumbent Republican candidate in history to win the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary, and he can expect a bump in the polls in South Carolina and Florida, where he is already ahead. Romney calls himself a ""numbers guy,"" but by the numbers he has a tremendously long way to go. He has won only handful of delegates. Even after the first four contests, only 15 percent of the delegates will be apportioned. Romney is banking that his wins create a bandwagon effect, drying up the money of his competitors and shrinking the appetite for the anti-Romney candidate. He is in essence hoping for the surge that has lifted every other candidate in this race except him. Expectations were high for Romney, and he met them. Thirty-five percent of New Hampshire voters said their most important issue was beating Barack Obama. Romney won 60 percent of them. Romney carried all groups--from Tea Party supporters to conservatives to moderates. Despite this week's attacks on Romney's tenure at Bain, voters still seem persuaded by his argument that his business experience makes him the best candidate to handle the economy. Among the 6-in-10 voters for whom the economy was the top issue, Romney more than doubled the support of his nearest competitor. Ron Paul won handily among young voters, getting 40 percent of the 18-29-year-old vote. He also won with voters who said voting for a ""true conservative"" was what motivated their vote. Paul grinned to his supporters at his election night party, and he reveled in being called ""dangerous."" Mitt Romney won handily, he said, ""but we're nipping at his heels."" But even if he was nipping, the exit polls showed Paul's limitations. 55 percent of those polled in New Hampshire said they would be dissatisfied if he won the nomination. Only 37 percent said that about Romney. In South Carolina, which votes a week from Saturday, Romney can expect 10 days of hell. South Carolina is likely to be the last stand of the anti-Romney forces, or the place where they turn the tide. Romney is likely to be the target of sustained attacks that may be last serious assaults of the primary-season nomination battle if he does well there. The Romney campaign is hoping that New Hampshire will validate him and sweep away the stories about Republicans unhappy with the front-runner. In the latest CBS national poll, 58 percent of Republicans say they want more presidential choices. Romney leads that poll but with only 19 percent. In exit polls of New Hampshire voters, 31 percent said they wanted another candidate to join the race. New Hampshire may end up acting as a shield for Romney against the recent attacks on his business career. Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry, and Jon Huntsman characterized Romney as a ruthless corporate raider. Though the attacks started too late to change the New Hampshire result much, Romney can claim that New Hampshire voters heard them and decided they were without merit. It's not clear who will go hardest after Romney now. The problem traditionally with attacking in a multicandidate field is that you harm the front-runner but you also hurt yourself. You don't attract his voters--you drive undecided voters away from both the target and yourself. That may be happening to Gingrich, who pressed the case against Romney most thoroughly, and whose super PAC plans to run millions of dollars of ads in South Carolina on the issue. His attacks on Romney's record at Bain were roundly criticized by conservatives from the National Review to Rush Limbaugh. Romney can't usually count on such conservatives as his allies. Romney also got a solid from Ron Paul, who said Huntsman, Perry, and Gingrich were attacking the free-market system. Gingrich won only 10 percent of the vote but vowed to continue his attacks on the front-runner. ""We're going to go all out to win in South Carolina,"" he told CNN's John King. ""We think that the contrast between a Georgia Reagan conservative and a Massachusetts moderate is pretty dramatic."" Jon Huntsman also said he would continue his campaign, though South Carolina may be too conservative for him. After all, 40 percent of his New Hampshire supporters said they were satisfied with Obama as president. Rick Santorum didn't match the surge he had in Iowa. But his 70 visits to New Hampshire and his Iowa bounce apparently made him a more attractive candidate. Santorum, who tied Gingrich at 10 percent, came in third among late-deciding voters. On Election Day, Romney enjoyed a movie in relative anonymity with his grandchildren, something he won't be able to for much longer. The kids saw The Muppets and Romney watched Mission: Impossible. After New Hampshire, he hopes one describes his rivals and the other describes their chances."	Was Romney's Victory Impressive Enough To Finally Win Over His Conservative Critics?
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/01/_i_love_firing_people_romney_s_bain_capital_record_has_become_a_huge_liability_.html	"""I'm a business guy,"" Mitt Romney likes to say. He hardly needs to. He so exudes corporate prowess, he could wear a tiny corner office as a lapel pin. For months, ""I'm a business guy"" has been the mantra of his campaign: It meant he understands the economy and has been in charge. Now, on the eve of the New Hampshire primary, his rivals would like to make that phrase poison in his mouth. Instead of a successful businessman who can help create jobs and improve lives, they are painting Romney as a ruthless Wall Street home wrecker. ""Is capitalism really about the ability of a handful of rich people to manipulate the lives of thousands of other people and walk off with the money?"" Newt Gingrich asked Monday. ""I do draw a distinction between looting a company, leaving behind broken families and broken neighborhoods and then leaving a factory that should be there."" These attacks may help Romney's primary challengers, and they will certainly soften up Mitt Romney for the general election. Importantly, they give credibility to an entire line of Democratic argument about income inequality and the destructive force of commerce. Before, Republican candidates could label those who would manage the excesses of the economy as socialists. The GOP critique of Romney ratifies the Democratic idea that the free market can breed excesses. None of Romney's rivals would admit they're saying that, but when you pile on this completely and in such blunt terms you are embracing the anti-corporate energy that has always been behind the Democratic attack. When Barack Obama talks about the excesses of Wall Street, conservatives say he is punishing success. If so, then Romney's rivals are doing the same thing. Gingrich had been harsh weeks ago when he challenged Romney to give back the money ""from bankrupting companies over his years at Bain."" But that attack went fallow until Sunday's debate, when Gingrich raised the issue again. His super-PAC has released a long video portraying Romney as a corporate raider motivated by greed, who used companies for a profit and then let them fail, indifferent to the human wreckage that caused. ""That was a man that destroyed us,"" says one laid-off worker in the film. Romney said he was surprised to see his Republican rivals ""put free enterprise on trial."" The surprise showed in his tone-deaf response. After the debate he talked at a town hall about how he had feared a pink slip, something that may very well have been true when he was younger but is so at odds with his current posture that he should have known better than to say it. Monday, in a discussion about changing insurance companies, he said ""I like being able to fire people who provide services to me."" Governor! Ixnay on the iringfay. His claim that he created 100,000 jobs from his investments is either rubbery or untrue. Jon Huntsman said Romney ""enjoys firing people. I enjoy creating jobs."" Rick Perry said Romney was ""getting rich off of failure and sticking it to someone else."" Perry said Romney was worried about pink slips because he was afraid he might run out of them (a great line that challenges my theory that the GOP campaign has been humor-free). Primaries warp parties. Bill Clinton, who was called the first black president, was accused of racism. Now Republicans are punishing private-sector success. Will any of this undermine Romney's strong position? There could be a backlash against his critics from conservatives irritated by the attack on competition and free enterprise. But if he keeps talking about pink slips and firing people, this could become a problem. He is also not very good about offering anecdotes about his struggling years or the good things that came from his years building up companies. The 90,000 people employed by Staples, a company he helped start, is a good start, but Romney is going to have to find a way to wriggle out of this caricature. (Not wearing a tie isn't enough.) Huntsman campaign manager John Weaver said Romney's response to the criticism was so gaffe-laden and tone-deaf, the candidate resembled John Kerry, which makes him unelectable. What's surely true is that he'll face more attacks like this if he qualifies for the general election. In that sense he should thank his rivals for giving him the chance to practice. If he were stumbling against Obama in the fall, he might never have a chance to recover."	"""I Like Being Able To Fire People"": The Devastating New Attacks on Romney's Business Record"

Following former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu at a rally on Wednesday, McCain said it reminded him of his favorite joke about governors: ""There were two inmates in the chow line in the state prison and one of them turned to the other and said the food was a lot better in here when you were governor."" A remarkable fact about the 2012 Republican presidential campaign is that it is not funny. Republican candidates give speech after speech and draw only a handful of chuckles, and the occasional wry smile. This makes for boring politics, but it also makes for bad politics. People want to like politicians they vote for and a smile helps with that. Laughter is also an effective tool for undermining your opponents and spreading your message with voters. You would be on firm ground if you said that times are too serious for a lot of jokes. You would also be on boring ground, and we would quickly move away from you and find someone more pleasant to talk to. It is possible to be humorous and serious at the same time. Great presidents who faced trying times were known for their humor. FDR mocked his Republican opponents in his ""Fala speech,"" which got its name from his charge that his opponents would stoop to even attacking his dog: ""I don't resent attacks, and my family doesn't resent attacks, but Fala does resent them."" Abe Lincoln's wit was collected in volumes Old Abe's Jokes and Abe's Jokes--Fresh From Abraham's Bosom, John Kennedy was a first-class wit, and Ronald Reagan was a famous jokester. ""I hope you're all Republicans,"" he quipped before doctors operated on him after the 1981 assassination attempt. Herman Cain is the only candidate who consistently drew a laugh. (This is not strictly true, I suppose: The others have generated their share of laughs--Rick Perry has been hysterical--but rarely intentionally.) This is a once-in-a-generation political humor crisis. Every campaign since 1968 has had at least one candidate who could make audiences smile. In 2008, Gov. Mike Huckabee and McCain could have qualified for Last Comic Standing. Even grimmer candidates such as Bob Dole and Pat Buchanan cracked jokes. My favorite from Dole, who wrote a book on political wit: ""History buffs probably noted the reunion at a Washington party a few weeks ago of three ex-presidents: Carter, Ford and Nixon--See No Evil, Hear No Evil and Evil."" Although my all-time favorite use of comedy in a political campaign was this 1968 Hubert Humphrey ad in which the notion of Spiro Agnew as vice president sends a man off the deep end. All of the Republican contenders insist they are optimists, but they don't seem to realize that there is no better way to convey optimism than with a smile. Humor suggests that no matter how dark things are, you have the sensibility to laugh, to see a bit of sun around the corner. This is McCain's gift. He certainly has no trouble conveying his fears--campaigning with Romney this week he spoke in dire terms about the danger the current president presents to American foreign policy--but his jokes suggest a brighter day. Humor is particularly helpful if you're trying to contrast yourself with a struggling incumbent. A sour sermon of despair can't possibly leave voters at a town hall with a warm feeling. There's a social networking benefit to humor too. A joke well-told gives the audience something they can pass along later to their friends. It magnifies your message easily or at least makes voters feel good enough that they report back favorably about their experience at your rally. Harry Truman's 1948 campaign--and arguably his presidency--was defined in a joke. During a speech attacking Republicans during that campaign, a supporter yelled ""Give 'em Hell, Harry!""  Truman replied, ""I don't give them Hell. I just tell the truth about them and they think it's Hell."" That quip became Truman's nickname. At the most recent debate Rick Santorum did show a little of this agility. While Ron Paul was attacking him the bell went off. When Paul paused Santorum interjected: ""It caught you not telling the truth, Ron."" Wit suggests an agile mind, which is useful for a president who needs to cut through complex subjects, rally people to a cause, or break the tension in negotiations. Given the polarization in Washington at the moment, perhaps wit is required more than ever. Peggy Noonan tells the story about Reagan, who listened while a reluctant senator explained why he wasn't supporting a bill. ""I'd jump out of a plane for you,"" said the senator, testifying to his loyalty. Reagan responded, ""Jump."" He got the vote. Among this year's stock answers when Republican candidates are asked about bipartisanship and compromise is to cite Ronald Reagan's cooperation with Democratic House Speaker Tip O'Neill. Their relationship was founded in part on joke telling. And here's a little tip for the candidates: It's actually not that hard to tell jokes. You can just steal from Rep. Mo Udall. That's what John McCain and Lamar Alexander did. ""I'm Mo Udall and I'm running for president,"" the failed Democratic candidate said, walking into a shop. ""Yeah,"" replied the barber, ""we were just laughing about that."" (Though candidates repeat Udall's best lines at their peril, like his observation that the difference between a cactus and a caucus is that with a cactus, the pricks are on the outside.) You can go too far, of course. James Garfield's political adviser warned him against humor--""Never make the people laugh. If you would succeed in life you must be solemn, solemn as an ass.""  Herman Cain used humor so much to dodge questions that it was unsettling. That joke about not knowing the name of foreign leaders isn't that funny if polls consistently show that voters think you're incapable of handling a foreign policy crisis or managing the serious duties of the Oval Office. My characterization of the current field may be slightly unfair to Newt Gingrich, who has been known to offer some humor. At a rally in Wolfeboro he signed a photograph from a voter named ""Slim,"" then said, ""Nobody has ever called me slim."" At the last debate he said he was struggling to hold his tongue so as not to appear ""zany,"" a wry reference to a dig by Mitt Romney. But Gingrich is so busy calling people stupid and adopts such a lecturing tone it may be harder to hear the humor in his pitch. And the bile in some of his jokes may sap their effectiveness. When he said Michelle Bachmann was ""factually challenged"" and compared her to one of his dumb students, it may have struck some as funny, but it might also have just seemed mean. It would be easier to endure the absence of laughter if the campaigns weren't otherwise so silly. It's not just that the debates and interviews force candidates into contortions. It's also that the candidates spend much of their time engaging in ridiculous hyperbole, offering straw man arguments, and pandering outrageously. If there's going to be clownish behavior, at least voters should get a few laughs out of it."	Republican humor crisis: Is this the least funny group of presidential candidates in history?

A parking lot outside a Nashua air hangar filled up long before the event began, and helpful security guards turned cars away from the private lots nearby. Paul's people, undeterred, parked along the winding road from downtown. By the time Paul started, there were cars with ""Don't Tread on Me"" and ""R3VOLUTION"" and ""Campaign for Liberty"" stickers stretching for a mile. Inside the hangar: Homemade signs, bed sheets with Paul slogans written on them, four miniature Ron Paul blimps and more than 600 joyful fans. Some of them had planted the Ron Paul banners hanging on overpasses throughout southern New Hampshire. They interrupt every other sentence with applause and chants. ""Two weeks ago,"" says Paul, ""they passed this very, very unordinary national defense authorization."" A woman next to me, hair midway through the process of dreadlockization, yells ""Traitors!"" ""The rest of the country,"" says Paul, ""better find out what's in that bill!"" ""Wake up!"" she yells. Paul talks the crowd through foreign policy, ""the whole idea of controlling the Internet,"" the unjustness of holding prisoners without trials, the malaise that sets in after three years of recession. ""They're frustrated with the leadership of both parties. They never see anything change. But they know darn well I will stick to my guns and put in that office--"" He's drowned out. The crowd has started chanting: ""President Paul! President Paul! President Paul!"" By this point I'm thinking back to Jon Huntsman's town hall in Newport, less than 24 hours earlier. It was massive, by Huntsman standards--around a third the size of Paul's rally. Another reporter whispered to me that it looked like a cleaned-up general election rally, and it did, with spotlights and flat-screen Vizio TVs bearing the slogan ""Newport for Huntsman."" And the candidate was copping Paul's lines, especially on foreign policy. ""We've done what we can do, folks,"" he said. ""I say, I want to bring our troops home. I want to say, we don't need to be nation-building in Asia when this nation so desperately needs our attention. We don't have a foreign policy that's worth anything when we're weak at home."" Big applause. ""Iraq is not our nation's future. Afghanistan is not our nation's future."" Huntsman is giving New Hampshire's anti-war, liberal voter a choice. Go with Ron Paul, and end up in a walled-off cul de sac of the GOP with no influence. Or go with Huntsman, who can win, beat Barack Obama and shut down the last 11 years of foreign policy clown shows. The strategy isn't working for Huntsman. Ron Paul, probably the most conservative Republican candidate to poll this high since Pat Buchanan, is choking off Huntsman's path to liberal voters. In Iowa, where anyone could change his registration by filling out a simple card at the caucuses, Paul won 43 percent of independents, beating Romney by 24 points. He won 40 percent of ""moderate or liberal voters,"" beating Romney by 5. In a WMUR poll of New Hampshire voters [PDF] released on Friday, Paul was winning the allegiance of ""undeclared"" voters over Romney, 37 to 32, and winning former Democrats--if they switched their registrations recently, they can vote here--by 1 point. Huntsman was lagging in the teens. How, if you're on Team Huntsman, is this fair? How can the absent-minded editor of the Ron Paul Survival Report be winning independents and liberals? Welcome to Operation Conservatize Ron Paul. Since Dec. 29, the Huntsman campaign has been putting out Web videos (not TV ads) clipping together glue-huffing conspiracy talk from the old Paul letters with footage of Paul dithering about their origins. On Jan. 4, Huntsman appeared right after Paul on Piers Morgan Tonight and milked a silly story about a Paul campaign tweet that mocked Huntsman's poor showing in Iowa. ""You think he would have learned the perils of ghost-written subject matter by now,"" Huntsman said. Attacking Paul for his own bad decisions hasn't made a dent. Huntsman has evolved to Phase II: attacking Paul for stuff that may or may not be sort of inspired by him, possibly. The Huntsman campaign has spent two days demanding contrition from Paul because a suspiciously new YouTube member named ""NHLiberty4Paul"" published a video--the account's only video--portraying the former ambassador to China as a shadowy double agent who can't stop adopting non-white babies. There's no hard evidence connecting the video to Paul, but the Huntsman campaign goaded Paul into denouncing it, inspiring headlines like ""Huntsman blasts Paul backer's ad calling him 'Manchurian candidate.' "" Team Huntsman needs liberals to hear this stuff and turn away from the nice old doctor with the anti-war views. ""Paul likes to play the crazy uncle who doesn't know how this stuff comes,"" explained Huntsman campaign strategist John Weaver in an interview before the Newport town hall. ""I think people are figuring it out."" The Paul campaign sees this as desperation, a winded boxer swinging in the 15th round with puffed-up eyelids and rubbery knees. The newsletter story is on hold; it burbled up again over the slow holidays, but Paul's narrow defeat in Iowa seems to have dulled some of his scrutiny. Paul's been polling second in New Hampshire for weeks, and as long as that's true, voters may feel it makes more sense to register an anti-war vote with him than with Huntsman. In fact Paul's supporters, die-hards and recent converts, are almost insulted when you ask whom else they like. Ken Akiyama, who came to the rally wearing a ""Veterans for Ron Paul"" shirt and camo pants, discovered Paul on a combative O'Reilly Factor interview. His candidate had nothing in common with Huntsman. ""I stopped looking at Huntsman when he said we'd show other nations what it meant to be a friend of America,"" he said. ""That's arrogant and revealing."" Other Paul voters ran down the weaknesses in the Huntsman pitch. He hadn't ruled out war with Iran. He didn't talk about sound money. He pandered, and Paul didn't. I talked to Teshia O'Keefe as she and her friend Kristin rolled up a 4x12 homemade Paul sign. She, too, only discovered Paul after 2008. Her big issues were the National Defense Authorization Act and the wars. Why would she ever back Huntsman? ""I'm pretty sure he worked for the Federal Reserve,"" she said. ""He was a weak governor, from what I've heard, and he's a dark person--we don't know much about him except that he worked for Obama."" Left unsaid: Paul's people don't need to know much about him. Liberals have been told all year, most memorably by Jon Stewart, that Paul's the outsider candidate the GOP hates. They've got a chance to get him delegates in New Hampshire. They're supposed to give that up for Jon Huntsman?"	Huntsman Struggles To Woo Liberal Voters Away From Not-Very-Liberal Ron Paul

Four years ago, he wanted to hug Romney long enough to stop his breathing. The bitter rivals from the 2008 campaign now have a common enemy: Barack Obama. So while McCain once accused Romney of Chamberlain-like weakness in Iraq, the two have now aligned to bash the incumbent for his handling of the withdrawal from that country. Bygones. But if the enemy of my enemy is my friend, it does not mean he's my boon companion. McCain, a hero in New Hampshire who won here in 2000 and 2008, joined this year's front runner at his first event in Manchester to solidify Romney's standing in a state where he leads in the polls by more than 20 points. Still, it was a synthetic graft, kicked off by the cringe-worthy playing of Kenny Loggins' ""Danger Zone"" from Top Gun, presumably a reference to Mr. McCain's service as a naval aviator. McCain repeatedly referred to having had ""numerous conversations"" with Romney on issues like taxation and immigration in a way that made it sound like those conversations numbered zero. If McCain was there to sprinkle his special magic, former Gov. John Sununu was there to shore up Romney's credentials. In his introduction, Sununu repeatedly referred to Romney as a ""true conservative"" for standing up for traditional marriage and against those who would expand abortion rights. The crowd was small and subdued. Maybe they're sick of seeing Romney so much. Maybe they reflected all the momentum that can be generated by an eight-vote Iowa victory. ""We forgot to congratulate the governor on his landslide,"" McCain joked. Romney's first questioner was a self-identified member of Occupy Wall Street who asked the candidate if he would amend his view that corporations are people. It led to a testy back and forth in which Romney reiterated that corporate profits go to shareholders and productive economic activity. The exchange had the air of an impatient father engaging with his son just home from college: a firm lecture that wasn't so stern as to spoil the family dinner. Democrats delight at seeing Romney defend corporations. They think they'll be able to paint Romney as the man in the corner office--a protector of indefensible inequalities created by imbalances in the economy. But in the GOP primary, Romney's views are mainstream. Voters have had trouble finding conviction and a core to Romney. These kinds of exchanges, in which he argues for capitalism and free markets, might actually help his campaign. It was the most passionate Romney was all day, and it won him his biggest applause in Manchester. Romney looked a bit like the McCain of 2000 and 2008, who regularly sparred with questioners at town hall meetings. His feistiness conveyed conviction, something voters worry about with Romney. It's that lack of conviction, in part, that created the opening that Rick Santorum exploited in Iowa. The Romney campaign might benefit from stocking the audience with a few Occupiers at each stop, but they'd be advised to let the candidate know because Romney can get authentically testy. When a woman stood up to ask about the gap between rich and poor, an irritated Romney immediately asked her to name a country where the average income is higher than the United States. Now he was being the smart kid home from college with a bunch of fancy knowledge. By the end of the day in Peterborough, the Romney-McCain alliance was bearing fruit. The town hall was packed with voters and they were eating up McCain's old jokes, like the story of the baggage handler who came up to him in an airport and asked if he's often mistaken for John McCain--when McCain said yes, he responded: ""Doesn't that just make you mad as hell?"" ""Send [Romney] to South Carolina with such momentum that it cannot be stopped,"" the former nominee said to strong applause. The city is a spiritual touchstone for McCain, whose overflow crowd here on his last day of campaigning in 2000 hinted at his big win that year. He was the insurgent against the establishment candidate. Now he's a member of the establishment parade endorsing the establishment candidate in the hopes that ambivalent Republicans will finally throw over their fears about Romney and just embrace him."	Will John McCain Convince New Hampshire Voters To Buy What Mitt Romney Is Selling?

The finish was so close that statistics majors at Iowa State will probably see it as a question on the final. Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum essentially tied at 25 percent, with Ron Paul a breath behind at 21 percent. But when you measure the key question in the Republican campaign: Do you vote for the electable candidate Romney or the candidate who speaks to your heart--Santorum and Paul--it was a 46-25 trouncing for the heart over the head.  According to entrance polls, of those voters who wanted a true conservative, Santorum got 36 percent and Romney got just 1 percent. (That is not a misprint.) Though the top two candidates tied, Santorum was the big winner. Weeks ago, the smart people thought that tonight he'd be addressing an empty ballroom of lonely, sad balloons. Instead, the crowd at his victory party is so thick I've practically got supporters on my lap as I type this. Santorum is now the only Flavor of the Week candidate to actually win anything, which makes him a genuine threat to Romney, at least for the moment. In 2008 Romney won 25 percent of the Iowa caucus vote. This time he got the same, despite the fact that the issues favored him more. Voters said improving the economy was the issue they cared the most about. That was the centerpiece of his pitch--that his business experience gave him unique insight and ability to fix the economy. But entrance polls backed up the softness of his support. Forty percent of those who voted for Romney said they had reservations about him. The Santorum surge was real. Based on entrance polls, of those who decided at the last minute, 33 percent went for Santorum and 23 percent went for Romney. It was a ratification of Santorum's closing argument: Don't settle. Santorum and Paul tapped into the prevailing emotion in Republican politics: conviction over expediency. If Santorum hasn't already compared himself to Tim Tebow, he will be doing it soon. Santorum ultimately did nearly 380 events in Iowa, and polls showed voters respected him for that. ""I thought about how he worked the state and his approach was all about building relationships with Iowans,"" Mary Maltby emailed me after deciding on caucus day to vote for Santorum. ""Listening, talking, discussing the issues of our country and our lives. I want a leader that can get in the midst of the people he/she serves and listen and respond to the needs of the majority of Americans.  Rick Santorum worked hard for the votes he is capturing."" But there are many nights to come. Santorum won around 30,000 votes, about 10,000 fewer than Mike Huckabee in 2008.  That's a spark for his campaign, but perhaps not a bonfire. Now he has to hope that the money comes in. He's headed straight to New Hampshire Wednesday, a state where Romney has a strong organization and plenty of money. Santorum's organization is also going to face extreme growing pains. Everything from scheduling events to fielding press calls is going to get more difficult. And the campaign is going to get uglier. Santorum is going to start taking more abuse from Paul and the other candidates, who will seek to recover from their weak Iowa showings. Romney and his allies may shell Santorum in the same way they battered Newt Gingrich. Millions of dollars of ads knocked Gingrich down to a fourth place finish with just 13 percent of the vote. Gingrich, who now calls Romney a liar (echoing Mike Huckabee's claim from 2008 that Romney was ""fundamentally dishonest""), looks like he may spend his declining days emptying his artillery. He has already purchased a full-page anti-Romney ad in the conservative Manchester Union Leader. This weekend there are two debates where things are likely to get testy. One of the open questions going into the caucus was how much evangelical voters would participate. They turned out in the identical numbers as the last caucus, with 58 percent of the voters self-identifying as evangelical. They helped Santorum with his surge. ""Everyone talks about the economy,"" said Bill Yewell of Augden, ""but Santorum comes at it from a different way. If we take care of the social issues and the family, the economy will come around."" As if to solidify Romney's position as the candidate the base isn't excited about, shortly before the final votes were counted Ben Smith reported that John McCain would endorse Romney. McCain, too, had trouble firing up GOP voters. Santorum shouldn't be surprised. He endorsed Romney in 2008, saying he had to do what he could to keep McCain from being president. Now McCain is returning the favor."	Romney Takes Iowa, but Santorum Really Won
8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/01/rick_santorum_s_surge_why_he_could_win_iowa.html	"BOONE, Iowa--You know you've arrived as a candidate in this state when you can't talk to actual voters. At the Reising Sun Cafe in Polk City, Iowa, on Monday, it was all madness and jostle as the press from all over the world swarmed to cover the latest hot candidate, Rick Santorum. Fussy foreign journalists whistled in winter jackets, tripods poked unmentionable places, and heavy cameras swung with a threat of contusion.* Voters were trampled, if they could get in to see the candidate at all. One woman, an actual undecided Iowan still weighing Santorum, Bachmann, and Perry, never made it through the press horde in the doorway. This kind of pack journalism that mobs the latest surge candidate is just what Santorum used to rail against from his position at the bottom of the polls. Not anymore. He was in Polk City to delight in being the Flavor of the Week. The attention is crucial because it gives Santorum a chance to broadcast his message of how ignored he has been. For months, his campaign was a solitary struggle. There was no boom microphone within 50 feet of his head. Republican voters have been looking for a candidate of conviction, someone willing to do what he believes regardless of the opposition. Romney has not been able to make that sale. Santorum can by simply pointing to the last few months. He talks some about his record in the Senate, but it is his 379 campaign stops that show he is willing to endure abuse and a long lonely struggle for something he believes. Santorum respected the Iowa system of retail campaigning and now he wants credit for it. He flatters voters and their special role of testing candidates in face-to-face meetings.  If Santorum wins, argues his supporter Chuck Laudner before every appearance, it will allow the Iowa system to survive: ""Lots of forces are trying to take this away from us."" A vote for Santorum is a vote for the caucus and its special place in the world. Santorum is a stylistically more passionate candidate than Romney. That's not difficult, but it helps when you're selling the idea of conviction. He makes lots of proclamations that tap into voter anger with Washington and its calculating ways. ""Your words must mean something, or don't say them.""
""Let's grow up and quit being like children."" 
""I'd rather lose an election than give up on principles."" Conviction is great, but wouldn't Iowa voters be throwing away their votes on Santorum? Santorum is strident, which might not appeal to independent voters in November. He lost his last election by nearly 20 points. He doesn't have money or an organization. Republicans consistently view Romney as the candidate who can beat Barack Obama: 48 percent said so in the latest Des Moines Register poll, but only 3 percent said that of Santorum. These arguments are all roughly true, but they don't appear to sway the Santorum voters. ""I think Romney is more electable than Santorum,"" said Bill Yewell, one of the actual Iowans uncrushed by the press pack in Perry, Iowa, ""But I'm just not confident in Romney."" If Iowa voters focus on electability rather than conviction, they will be doing exactly what they say they hate about Washington politicians. That was the conflict among Republicans during the latest battle over the payroll tax. Tea Party Republicans didn't want to compromise even though the party was being harmed politically. They came to Washington to act on conviction, they said, not to do the political thing. Santorum makes this pitch explicitly. ""Do not settle for less than what America needs to transform this country,"" he says, without using Romney's name but referring to him as plainly as if he held up his portrait. ""You are going to be told that you have to settle for someone who isn't quite as strong in order for us to win."" There's a catch though. In 2008, Santorum supported Mitt Romney based on just the kind of calculation he's asking voters to eschew this time. ""There were other better candidates,"" he admits, but he thought Romney had the best chance of stopping John McCain. This contradiction wasn't lost on one voter who asked about it at an event. Santorum didn't have a great answer. If only a CNN cameraman had elbowed that guy away at the door.

Why Iowans Are Going Bananas for Santorum's Uncompromising Style
9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/01/santorum_s_surge_can_the_senator_take_the_iowa_caucus_.html	"DES MOINES, IOWA--Rick Santorum is so hot right now, you'd think he was the cure to something. When pollsters for the Des Moines Register started contacting Republican voters on Tuesday, Santorum was at 10 percent. By Friday when the polling ended, he was at 22 percent, tied for the lead. If they'd kept calling Saturday, voters might have answered the phone singing the senator's name. When the days were averaged out, which pollsters do to smooth out anomalies, the findings put Romney at 24 percent, Ron Paul at 22 percent, and Santorum at 15 percent. Given the trend, it's possible Santorum could win the caucus on Tuesday, which would be a perfect ending to a volatile race. The question in Iowa right now is: Are Iowa Republicans finally waking to the wonders of the two-term senator, or is Santorum simply the latest candidate who is not Mitt Romney? Voters have been on a constant rummage through the bin, looking for an alternative. First they moved toward Bachmann, then Perry, Cain, Gingrich, and Paul. Santorum is the last one left. The answer is probably a combination of the two. Santorum has put himself in a position to take advantage of the moment. He has worked the state harder than any other candidate, visiting all 99 counties and attending 250 events over the last six months. For months he was the Nowhere Man, toiling away and not budging in the polls. Santorum is also a conviction candidate in a contest that has always been between voters who want an electable candidate (Romney) and voters who want a candidate who shares their conservative values (anyone but Romney). Santorum has talked about social issues in a way that appealed to evangelical voters who now appear to be rallying to him. ""The reason I ran is 'cause I think people know there is more than just a little narrow issue called 'jobs,' "" he told CBS's Jan Crawford. Rick Santorum is either Mike Huckabee, who in 2008 won Iowa with 34 percent of the vote, or Pat Robertson, who in 1988* came in second with 25 percent of the vote. Both appealed to social conservatives, but Huckabee expanded the electorate, drawing new voters to the process. On caucus night, longtime participants noticed people showing up they'd never seen before at Republican functions. Those were the Huckabee fans. At the moment, Santorum looks to be inspiring Huckabee-like fervor. In the Register poll, 76 percent of Santorum supporters say they will definitely caucus rather than probably attend, a higher proportion than for any other candidate. But this enthusiasm may not carry Santorum all the way to a win. So far, the overall number of evangelical voters appears to be down from 2008. But Ann Selzer, the highly respected pollster who runs the Des Moines Register poll, ran the numbers for a Huckabee-like turnout. Under that scenario, Rick Santorum wins with 25 percent, and Mitt Romney is second at 20 percent. Santorum's rise would seem to contradict a storyline from this year that organization doesn't matter in Iowa. Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich rose to the top of the polls without blanketing the state. The old cliche that you're supposed to work hard and get hot at the end may not be dead, after all. The Register poll shows Iowans have recognized Santorum's hard work. He leads in the categories of ""relating to ordinary Iowans"" and ""least ego-driven""--you'd have to be to endure those months of lonely campaigning. He's also benefitted by avoiding the scrutiny that has battered other candidates. Negative ads about Paul may have been what stopped his rise. (He's slipped in the last days of polling.) Newt Gingrich, once the front-runner, has plummeted after a sustained attack of negative ads. In the latest Des Moines Register poll he is now seen as the most ego-driven, least able to bring about change, least consistent. Still, Santorum can't count on a strong showing. Nearly every Republican candidate has enjoyed a surge in the 2012 Republican race, except for Mitt Romney, who seems to have a surge protector. At 24 percent he is almost exactly where he was in the June Des Moines Register poll, which he also led with 23 percent. In the October poll he was at 22 percent. His final caucus result in 2008 was 25 percent. The good news for Romney in the poll is that as fervent as the search for an alternative seems to be, voters will be OK if he wins: 78 percent said they would be very enthusiastic or OK with the choice if Romney were the nominee, the highest enthusiasm of the top candidates tested. And Romney just might win, benefitting from a splintered field. He's working the state hard in the final days, the culmination of a long-planned strategic blow-off of Iowa. Romney didn't participate in the compulsory events of Iowa politics--the Iowa straw poll, the Reagan dinner--and he didn't visit the state much. But his organization from 2008 was largely intact. If he had a late opportunity, the plan was to rush into the state to make a smash and grab at the very end. Romney is drawing big crowds and finishing on a clear pitch: He's the most electable candidate. In the poll, 48 percent said he was the most electable. (His closest competitor, Newt Gingrich, got only 13 percent.) If Romney wins, it will not only ratify his Iowa strategy and give him a boost going into his stronghold of New Hampshire, but it will ratify his larger cautious strategy, which has been to focus on attacking President Obama and not responding to every challenger who seems momentarily hot. Political reporters and pros love the Des Moines Register poll that's shown the late edge for Santorum because it accurately predicted the outcome of both the Republican and Democratic races in 2008. We're also all desperate for something to hold on to in this highly speculative last phase. All my phone conversations with sources are starting to sound the same--inferences about support drawn by crowd sizes (are Santorum's crowds as large as Huckabee's were?) and conjecture about whether this race is like 1980 or 1988 or 1996. When the conversation stalls we talk about what people universally talk about at stalled points: the weather. How will it affect turnout at the 7 p.m. caucuses? It's supposed to be relatively warm on caucus day, with no precipitation, which one Republican veteran suggested would hurt Ron Paul. His supporters are the most motivated, which means he'd benefit from bad weather. His troops would mount the snowmobiles, whereas the Romney voters might stay home and enjoy a nice fire. (The Register poll contradicted this idea. Only 56 percent of Paul supporters said they would definitely attend the caucus. He no doubt has a tough core following, but as his support has grown, he's also taken on less ardent followers. This explains why he may be losing some support to Santorum.) With two days until the voting starts, the race is as fluid as anyone can remember, though the 41 percent who told the Des Moines Register they could change their mind is smaller than the nearly 50 percent who said that in 2008. In that election, those last-minute deciders gave Mike Huckabee 34 percent of the vote and dealt a devastating blow to Mitt Romney. That was back when races used to only have one or two surges. 2012 has been a season of surges, but Santorum may have timed his perfectly. Correction, Jan. 1, 2012: This article originally stated that Pat Robertson placed second in the Iowa caucus in 1980. Robertson placed second in 1988. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"	Dickerson: Could Santorum Really Win Iowa?
10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/12/michele_bachmann_all_anyone_wants_to_talk_about_is_kent_sorenson_.html	"NEVADA, Iowa--In a few minutes, Michele Bachmann's whale-blue campaign bus will pull up to the Snack Time Family Restaurant in this central Iowa town. It's running a little late. I use the extra time to buy a copy of the Ames Tribune, the paper that serves the college town next door. On Page One: a picture of Bachmann standing on a chair, surrounded by signs with her name on them, rapt Iowa crowd totally unaware of the banner headline they're going to appear under: ""Wheels coming off?"" Bachmann is closing out a 14-day, 99-county tour of the state where she was born. At each stop, she delivers a capsule version of her stump speech, shakes hands, and poses for a video asking the good people of the county to caucus for her. All that work, and what's the story? Kent Sorenson. Her Iowa campaign chairman, a first-term state senator, ditched her on Wednesday night. He appeared with her at a stop in Indianola, and then, hours later, joined Ron Paul in Des Moines to announce his switch. ""There is a clear top tier in the race for the Republican nomination for president,"" he explains in the Tribune, adding that he maintains ""an immense amount of respect for Michele."" Funny, she doesn't seem to think of him that way. ""Kent said to me yesterday that 'everyone sells out in Iowa, why shouldn't I,' "" she told the Tribune. ""Then he told me he would stay with our campaign."" My friend was bribed. I was betrayed. This was the closing message from the Republican who once led the Iowa polls. The whole day's been like this. In the morning, Bachmann walked into the temperature-controlled calm of the Jan Mickelson Show to field friendly questions. No curveballs until a caller asked Bachmann to explain something: She says Sorenson had been offered money, but her state political director, Wes Enos, swore it wasn't true. ""[Kent] told me himself that he was offered money, a lot of money, by the Ron Paul campaign,"" says Bachmann. ""It was very clear that this effort to offer him money happened after the Sioux City debate, after we were gaining tremendous momentum in all 99 counties across Iowa. People were flipping away from Ron Paul. They were coming to decide on Michele Bachmann."" Hang on. The Sioux City debate, where Bachmann pointed a flamethrower at Paul and blasted until the gas ran out, was Dec. 15. On that day, the RealClearPolitics average of polls pegged Paul at 16.6 percent, good enough for third place, and Bachmann at 9.6 percent, good enough for fifth. Four days later, Paul jumped to first place. By Dec. 28, when Sorenson switched jerseys, Paul was at 22.5 percent, and Bachmann was at 9 percent. Sure, there are lots of ways of gauging momentum. Crowd size, for example. But Paul's crowds are bigger than Bachmann's. What was she talking about? It's a question you could have asked any day this year. The Bachmann campaign was supposed to be the embodiment of the Tea Party. The movement had ""catapulted her from a backbencher in Washington to a leading contender on the presidential trail""--this from the Lois Romano profile of Bachmann, largely remembered for the googly-eyed Newsweek cover it came with. That cover ran right after the debt ceiling compromise, right when S&P downgraded America's credit rating because, in part, ""the majority of Republicans in Congress continue to resist any measure that would raise revenues."" When that happened, Bachmann was in Iowa reminding Republicans that she ""led the fight against raising the debt limit."" She won the $35-per-ticket Ames Straw Poll, aided by her husband passing out free tickets from a golf cart. The very same day, Rick Perry entered the race. Bachmann would never again lead a poll in Iowa. We can't say Bachmann suffered because she was unserious. Come on. For a whole month, the Iowa frontrunner was Herman Cain. She didn't have the money of Mitt Romney or Ron Paul, but there was a long period when few TV ads were running. The best explanation for her fade might be that Bachmann fell into a constant pattern of attack, a one-woman embodiment of the fight-happy Congress that even Republicans were showing fatigue with. Bachmann finishes the radio show, meets the press outside, then heads to the Principal Financial Group in Des Moines for a town hall meeting. Few candidates thrive in a morning assembly-style setting like this, with an audience that might not even be Republican. Bachmann doesn't thrive. She looks up and down from a text to tell voters who she's thinking of: ""in George Bailey's terms, those who do the living and working and dying in this town."" She reminds us that she ""led 40,000 Americans to Washington, D.C., to oppose Obamacare."" (This was the ""Code Red"" rally, two years ago--and ""Obamacare"" passed.) She compares herself to Margaret Thatcher, promising to be ""America's Iron Lady."" It's a line she'll use all day, one that echoes the title of the new, Meryl Streep-starring biopic about Thatcher. There are only a few audience questions. Nicole Cavreriva, a skeptical Democrat, asks how Bachmann will be more effective than President Obama at working with Congress. ""It's been highly contentious,"" nods Bachmann. ""As a matter of fact, we've been threatened eight times this year with a government shutdown."" Is it the start of a mea culpa about how House Republicans have governed? No, it's the start of Bachmann's pledge to elect 13 Republican senators to break filibusters. A more sympathetic questioner asks her again: What if Republicans don't win 13 seats. ""O, ye of little faith!"" says Bachmann. ""I guess it's a logical answer,"" shrugs Cavreriva after the speech. ""She's the new Margaret Thatcher. Who knew?"" The Republicans in the audience are kinder, but they're not talking about caucusing for her. ""I like Romney's business experience,"" explains Mark Kron. Bachmann keeps saying she was a tax lawyer and a small business owner (that would be the Bachmann Clinic, the ex-gay facility), but it doesn't sway him. Bachmann moves right on, taking her campaign bus to the steps of the state capitol. It drives by Kent Sorenson, who's doing a Fox News hit and reasserting his integrity. It parks outside the building, dark blue against tan stone, as the candidate talks to the Iowa Association of Mortgage Brokers. The bus has been repainted with the slogan, ""Win Win Win,"" a phrase Bachmann used at a debate to one-up Herman Cain on his 9-9-9 plan. Bachmann is very much on her game at this stop, conversant on the facts. ""Under Dodd-Frank, only 26 percent of the rules have been written so far,"" she says. ""The banking industry is a bad investment right now."" Bachmann finishes her county tour in central Iowa, ending it in Nevada, aides showing off a cake that commemorates the accomplishment. These aides enter the diner, apologizing, because Bachmann needs to do a TV hit before visiting. Can volunteers come outside to hold signs behind her? They can. They stand there as Bachmann argues with Wolf Blitzer about Sorensongate. ""I've got my phone, my phone log that shows I had a conversation with Kent Sorenson,"" she says. ""That's when he told me, a number of other people on our campaign, that he was offered money by the Ron Paul campaign."" At the break, she holds up her white iPhone for reporters, who snap pictures of it, Sorenson's personal number clearly visible from a Tuesday, 3:11 p.m. call. What good does it do her to close out Iowa with a he-said-she-showed-phone-logs stick fight? It builds some sympathy. Voters I talk to immediately assume that Sorenson is a cad, and Bachmann was wronged. State Sen. Robert Bacon shows up at the diner to be polite, even though he's endorsed Rick Santorum. When I ask about Sorenson, he leans back, as if recovering from a hit to the kidneys. ""I need to talk to Kent,"" he says. ""I don't know what happened. But I don't like to hear things like 'everybody's for sale.' I can speak for myself, I'm not for sale."" Bachmann enters the diner, gets handed a giant serrated knife for cake-cutting, and waves it around for cameras. ""This is what I'm bringing to the White House!"" She cuts a few slices, repeats the ""Iron Lady"" line and a short stump speech, then apologizes: She has to speed out for an interview with Simon Conway, another sympathetic radio host. ""I have to do it in studio,"" she explains. The floor is ceded to Tamara Scott, Bachmann's Iowa co-chair, who recently warned that gay marriage could lead to legal marriage between people and ""Eiffel Tower""-like objects. She talks for 20 minutes about how, despite what people may think, it's all right, as far as the Bible's concerned, for conservatives to elect a woman president. ""Think of Queen Esther,"" she says. ""And Jesus was revolutionary in the way he treated women."" The diners, around 40 of them, generally like Bachmann. But they're miffed that she left so quickly. One of them, a Vietnam veteran, wanted to ask her whether or not she would bring back the draft. (He's for it.) Most of them will miss the Bachmann appearance on the radio, which I get to hear on the drive out. Bachmann is preceded on the show by Rick Santorum, who simply calls in.

The report, dated Nov. 11, was held back until Christmas Eve, when it was released at the happiest time of the year. But we should not allow it to slip into oblivion. In response to Sept. 11, the Pentagon's publicity department organized at least 161 ""outreach"" meetings with retired military officers serving as television commentators on the war effort. The Pentagon provided this select group with high level briefings, showering them with talking points and otherwise equipping them to be media defenders of administration policy. The meetings were suspended in 2008 amid a first wave of reports alleging improprieties. The inspector general responded with a defense of the outreach program in 2009, but his initial report was so full of errors that he retracted it and went back to the drawing board. The inspector general's office has now returned with a much more comprehensive effort, aiming to determine whether the program's purpose was to provide a ""free flow of news and information"" and ""to benefit a broadly representational community."" It had a tough time coming up with an answer, since its investigators found that the Pentagon's effort was a seat-of-the-pants operation. It never produced serious guidelines on how ""outreach"" should proceed; nor did it keep serious records of what actually occurred. The inspector general deserves a lot of credit for reconstructing a partial account on the basis of a wide-ranging review of the documentary evidence and extensive interviews with participants. But its conclusions are unpersuasive. The report reconstructs attendance at 21 ""outreach"" sessions involving the five major television news channels between 2002 and 2008. Only Fox had its retired military pundits at all 21; in contrast, ABC, CNN, and NBC were represented only half the time, and CBS pundits went to 75 percent of the meetings. Nevertheless, the Inspector General dismissed the idea that the Pentagon gave special access to Fox pundits because ""about half"" of the events had ""representatives from three or more of the five major TV news outlets."" According to the instpector general, these figures satisfied DOD regulations requiring ""broad participation."" Worse yet, the report acknowledges that General Barry McCaffrey, who won a Distinguished Service Medal in Desert Storm, was excluded from meetings as punishment after he publicly criticized the Iraq war: ""I was told ... that this was the Secretary's decision,"" explained an unnamed official at the public relations office. When asked about this at an interview, Secretary Rumsfeld responded, ""I don't know for sure."" Despite this memory lapse, the inspector general found that the exclusion was politically motivated, citing a ""preponderance of the evidence."" But the report concludes that troubling incidents involving other leading generals were insufficiently substantiated to add up to a general pattern of political animus. Even so, the inspector general fails to put the McCaffrey affair into the larger politicized context: the privileged access offered to Fox News commentators espousing right-wing views friendly to the Bush administration. This blinkered approach continues throughout the report. While DOD regulations only authorize  ""the free flow of news and information,"" the outreach sessions involved much more. They were, as the report itself notes, occasions for the distribution of ""talking points"" that outlined the best way to defend Administration policies. But once again, the inspector general sees no problem. After all, ""the talking points only included opinions if [they had been] expressed by the leadership."" Moreover, the generals had ""not been paid to be news readers or to otherwise deliver text ... provided by DOD."" This is true, but the talking points still violated policy by trying to guide the officers to take positions favored by ""leadership,"" rather than simply to ""inform"" them. The report also dismisses the fact that 43 of the 63 retired generals in the program were involved with defense contractors. It discounts this potential conflict of interest on the basis of its interviews with 35 generals, almost all of whom denied that they used the meetings ""to identify new business opportunities."" But this finding ignores a critical dimension: Even if the generals didn't use their position to gain financially, their ongoing business relations could well have influenced them to back the Pentagon's talking points. The Department of Defense violated its policy requiring ""broad"" outreach when it made them into the majority of its group. This report amounts to a remarkable Christmas present for the Pentagon. What it calls a ""broad"" program of ""information outreach"" was a systematic effort to provide talking points to a sympathetic audience, largely associated with defense contractors, who were working for a biased sample of news organizations. In case they didn't get the message, Barry McCaffrey's fate made it clear what they could expect if they refused to play the game. A simple reform can change this reality. The Department should be stripped of its right to determine its own guest list at its high-level media briefings. It should extend invitations to all major news organizations, and give them unfettered freedom to choose their own military experts. This will decisively shift the balance, allowing us to hear authoritative commentary not just from pundits who please the Pentagon, but from experts who represent their organization's best shot at independent journalism. The distribution of ""talking points"" should also be banned, and conflict-of-interest rules tightened, but letting the media select its own attendees will make the key difference--enabling the program to express a fuller commitment to the ""freedom of ... the press"" guaranteed by the Constitution. Unfortunately, initial departmental reaction to the report has been disappointing. Naturally enough, its public affairs division was ""pleased that the IG found our outreach activities in compliance with DOD policies."" But it has refused to follow up on the report's sole recommendation, and take immediate steps to formulate a systematic policy for future PR campaigns. It claims that there is no need to heed the Inspector's call to develop clear operating principles since it isn't planning anything like the Bush media offensive. This is a big mistake. There will be future crises, and future efforts to transform our retired military into cheerleaders for the powers-that-be. The administration's logic is precisely backward: It should take advantage of the relative calm to impose sensible constraints in this sensitive area of civil-military relations. The report gives the public affairs division a deadline of Jan. 9,  to come up with some serious guidelines. But unless there is a sustained critique of the media manipulations of the Bush years, it is unlikely to take the problem seriously, and its regulations will affirm the status quo. Once the division has gained the final approval of the inspector general, the entire matter will be forgotten--only to re-emerge in pathological form after the next terrorist attack."

There's a whole industry--I'm part of it, as an MSNBC contributor--which puts reporters on television to predict what will happen next in situations that involve hundreds or thousands of players and countless unknowable facts. We're not always wrong, but we're wrong enough. In 2010, for the first time, I subjected myself to a round of pundit accountability, paging back through Slate's easily navigable archives to discover what predictions I'd blown. It was horrible, so I decided to do it again. Luckily, I didn't botch as many calls this year. One reason for that was I didn't make as many calls. In 2011, I tried harder to limit my chin-stroking to occasions when I'd reported out the details of something. A month before the special election for Anthony Weiner's seat, I acknowledged polls showing that Democrats could lose it. (No repeat of my 2010 mistake of quoting Democrats who were sure, 100 percent sure, that they'd elect Martha Coakley to the U.S. Senate.) I argued that Republicans ""won"" the debt limit fight, and I'd stand by that, even if their poll numbers have crumbled since then. No party's going to thrive in 9 percent unemployment; the GOP has extracted massive concessions. No, I only fumbled a few big predictions this year. Here they are. July 27: Rick Perry will be a competent candidate. For weeks before Rick Perry entered the primaries, I theorized about how he could win. (In my defense, so did lots of other people.) On MSNBC Live in July, I explained that ""right now there is not really any credible Southern candidate for the nomination."" If Perry got in the race, I said, he'd pull it off. How could I have been so wrong? I blame Perry, and I blame myself for not taking more seriously the self-serving, yet true, theory that the guy was just not that ready to play the big game. Aug. 12: Perry's book and policies won't sink him. I drank deep at the Rick Perry well, slaking my thirst for a frontrunner as if I was some conquistador who'd stumbled upon a magic fountain. None of the very smart reasons why Perry would falter made any sense to me. In August, on MSNBC, I tried to convince Chris Hayes that Perry's insistence that Social Security was a ""Ponzi scheme"" would not hurt him. ""Republicans have shifted our conversation pretty far down this road towards rethinking whether the New Deal worked, rethinking whether we need a welfare state,"" I said, mixing metaphors. (It's TV. You try it.) I doubted that Perry would take on water after defending his mandatory HPV policy in Texas. I wasn't immediately sure that he had burned himself on immigration. But this was the issue--at last--that put me right. By Sept. 24, after the Florida  debate, I was talking to voters who had ruled out Perry just because he said his critics had ""no heart"" on immigration. Sept. 21: Newt can never come back! It seemed obvious at the time: Newt Gingrich couldn't possibly bounce to the top of the GOP race. After reading a bunch of pieces on the topic, I confidently argued that Paul Bedard of U.S. News and Scott Conroy of Real Clear Politics had it all wrong. ""Gingrich is campaigning independently of the field,"" I reasoned. ""You can see the finish line in his eyes: enhanced stature, new requests for TV and speaking jobs, new books."" These guys were clearly just writing columns for column-writing sake. No, they weren't. The candidate-to-candidate polling didn't suggest that Gingrich was surging, but other evidence did. Republican voters who had given up on Gingrich after he appeared to trash Paul Ryan's budget (Ryan certainly thought he had) had forgiven him. Gingrich hadn't really factored in the fights between candidates, in debates or elsewhere, and the candidates who let the other guys implode almost always benefit. (Ask John Kerry.) If Rick Perry faltered, yes, Herman Cain stood to benefit. But Cain was never a credible candidate who could go the distance against Mitt Romney. He'd never been vetted. Gingrich had. He didn't seem to know anything about anything. Gingrich did. My mistake would have been forgivable if I'd stopped there. But my fullest statement of this nonsense, titled ""Meanwhile, Mitt's Still Winning,"" ran on Nov. 2. That was after Cain started to implode and after Rick Perry had largely bumbled his way out of contention. Dec. 20: Republicans won't cave on the payroll tax holiday. Well, they did. Two days after I argued that Republicans would stick to their guns and deny Democrats a two-month, fairly clean extension of the payroll tax cut, the Republicans tossed their guns to the ground and ran home. Republicans had just talked so confidently about the fight, getting snippy with reporters who asked if they were losing on ""optics"" or something. ""Who cares?"" laughed Rep. Stephen LaTourette. ""The Senate is our enemy. I don't know any House Republican who can't go home and say, 'I don't know what that loony Senate is up to.' If you can't say that, you're in the wrong business."" Now he knows some. I'll stand by my analysis that Republicans moved the argument forward and set themselves up well for the coming payroll tax fight of February 2012. But they blew it, getting a bluff called by Democrats for the first time all year. It was a surprise. Here's to more surprises in 2012, even if they prove I'm wrong. Got a botched prediction of your own? Notice something I got wrong but conveniently left off this list? Send it to david.weigel@slate.com."	Pundit audit: My four dumbest political predictions of the year.
13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/12/ron_paul_iowa_what_happens_if_the_libertarian_stalwart_actually_wins_the_caucuses_.html	"Jan. 3, 2012. The ballroom of the Des Moines hotel fills faster than anyone expected. Iowa Republicans are still caucusing, but fans of Ron Paul have driven in from Omaha, Rockford, Minneapolis, Topeka, and Pittsburgh, their cars festooned with ""Legalize the Constitution"" stickers. They hit the cash bars early. At 8 p.m., the networks release the first scraps from ""entrance polls."" Lots of first-time caucusers. Lots and lots of anti-Washington sentiment. Lots and lots of Tea Partiers. The ballroom crowd boos when some cable-news Muppet explains that ""some people are saying that a Ron Paul win would mark the end of the Iowa caucuses."" Suddenly they realize why the anchor is saying that: He's trying to explain why Paul is leading. At 9 p.m., they call it: ""Ron Paul is the winner of the 2012 Iowa caucuses."" The ballroom fills up with confetti and boozy cheers. The 76-year-old candidate takes the stage, joined by the junior senator from Kentucky and the rest of his brood. Those hair-gelled media nabobs will have to report on a new Republican front-runner now. This could happen. Two weeks before the Iowa caucuses, the Republican wheel of random candidate surges has finally click-clack-clicked over to Ron Paul. A Fox News columnist says it. A CNN columnist says it. The heartless RealClearPolitics polling average says it, even if it's goosed by an odd, one-day Insider Advantage survey. The gamblers of InTrade, who don't often move unless they've got a preponderance of anecdote and conventional wisdom to work with, are now betting on Paul to win in Iowa. The groundwork for Paul's recent surge was laid four years ago. When his campaign sputtered out in 2008--he competed in the final GOP primaries, then had his own ""alternative convention"" opposite the RNC--Paul set up the Campaign for Liberty and Young Americans for Liberty. Those 501c4 groups were designed as part-time organizations for his idle-hands followers, ways to keep building a movement. That plan worked. Paul's group helped his son Rand win a Senate seat. In Iowa, it helped his campaign figure out how and where to set up, and what it needed to do win. When I visited Paul's Iowa headquarters last week, in its cost-cutting location in the Des Moines suburbs, the power had just gone out. A devoted skeleton crew was working by candlelight; a table of campaign literature introduced the candidate as ""a Conservative who lives by Faith"" (capital letters in the original), a man who had ""delivered more than 4,000 babies"" and says ""it is God Who gave Us life."" I saw devotion, and I saw a campaign willing to settle on a message that could actually win Iowans, not just make some paleolibertarian point. These guys wanted to win. How many Republicans will Paul's camp need to win on Jan. 3? In 2008, Iowa caucus-goers cast 119,188 votes. Paul won 11,841 of them, while Mike Huckabee won by scoring 40,954. How much better do activists expect Paul to do this time? At the 2007 straw poll in Ames, the overhyped trial heat/candidate Darwinizer for the caucuses, Paul won only 1,305 votes, and Huckabee won 2,587. At the 2011 straw poll, Paul won 4,671 votes. If he multiplies his straw poll votes at the same rate he did four years ago, he he wins. That's how Ron Paul gets to Jan. 3. On Jan. 4, he would get his headlines, and his supporters would get to watch the media squirm. In fact, that squirming has already begun. On Fox News, Chris Wallace says that caucuses ""won't count"" if Paul wins. In Politico, James Hohmann noted in an aside that ""Ron Paul's candidacy might provide some wiggle room for a candidate who scores a close fourth."" But there's only so much the political press can do to control a story like this. Paul's victory would dominate the news. The candidate, already in the high teens in New Hampshire polls, would fly into the state as the best hope to beat Mitt Romney locally. Jon Huntsman would keep playing, but Gingrich, Perry, and whoever else was left would have start pivoting to a South Carolina/Florida strategy. And Paul would find himself targeted, for the first time, by a hostile, tackle-the-front-runner media. We don't know what that campaign would look like. Paul is in a curious place--a three-time presidential candidate who has barely been vetted by the media. He's been the GOP's proudest anti-war, anti-torture voice for four years. That position has earned him soft interviews with Jay Leno, and countless segments on The Daily Show. If Paul wins Iowa, that stops. The conservative press, which has been bored but hostile to Paul all year (just see the National Review's cover story), will remind its readers that Paul wants to legalize prostitution and narcotics, end aid to Israel (as part of a general no-aid-for-anyone policy), and end unconstitutional programs like Medicare and social security. The liberal press will discover that he's a John Birch Society supporter who for years published lucrative newsletters studded with racist gunk. In 2008, when the media didn't take him seriously, Paul was able to get past the newsletter story with a soft-gummed Wolf Blitzer interview. (""Certainly didn't sound like the Ron Paul that I've come to know and our viewers have come to know all this time,"" said Blitzer.) This was when Paul was on track to lose every primary. It'll be different if the man wins Iowa. Maybe all of this would drag Paul down. But would it have to? In 2008, the candidate stuck it out through every primary. In 2012, he'll have more cash than anyone except Romney or Perry--he just raised $4 million in a weekend moneybomb. His supporters will blow off the scrutiny as just so much crap from the corporate media. (Alex Jones will quibble with this characterization: It's really the ""illuminati"" media.) No, Paul will stick in the race. Mitt Romney will get to contrast himself with the new-new-new-new insurgent. In that case, the GOP base and donor class will have the easiest pick-a-door choice it's ever had. Do you go with the guy from Massachusetts who's not all that convincing of a Reagan clone, or do you go with the guy who wants legal heroin and a pissed-off Benjamin Netanyahu? That's a dream scenario for Team Romney. When I asked the candidate's adviser Stuart Stevens about how Ron Paul factored into their plans, he kicked his own campaign's expectations through the floor. ""Ron Paul could win Iowa,"" he said. This is not how worried people talk. Let's see how they sound on Jan. 4."	What Will the GOP and the Press Do If Ron Paul Wins Iowa?
14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/12/iowa_gop_debate_dickerson_and_weigel_chat_with_readers_about_the_iowa_caucuses_.html	"Slate political correspondents John Dickerson and David Weigel were on our Facebook page to chat with readers about last night's GOP presidential debate and the state of the 2012 election. This transcript has been edited for clarity. John Dickerson: Hi everyone. The Hilton Garden Inn room I'm in doesn't have a desk so this is a test of my ability to answer questions and the laptop's ability to not catch on fire. Dave Weigel: I'm here, having raced/crawled through traffic from the airport. Ready, raring. Gabby Weiss: Do you think that Huntsman is the dark horse candidate here? Will saner heads prevail? Collin Czarnecki: I second Gabby's question. John Dickerson: Gabby I'm just not sure Huntsman can break through. He's inching up in N.H. but he just doesn't feel like he connects with the voting gut of a party that this year is voting with its gut (not that they don't normally, actually). _______________________ Christophe Diederich: How serious is Obama about stopping Iran from becoming a nuclear power? John Dickerson: Christophe we can't really know how serious he is because much of what's going on is covert, but with scientists dying, computer worms crashing centrifuges and drones crashing in Iran I'd say there's a pretty high level of seriousness. John Dickerson: Though obviously a lot of that is Israel too. _______________________ Brian Lemieux: How do you see the Republican message evolve from the primaries to the general election against Obama? Dave Weigel: Good question, because my assumption for a very long time was that the Three Stooges-esque dogpile of conservative candidates would allow Mitt Romney to slip through and win the nomination without making too many concessions to the right. He just started making concessions, basically, this month, starting when he hit Newt Gingrich for a lack of Ryan plan philo-ism. If it's Romney, you'll see him tack right back to the ""Obama's a good guy, he just can't create jobs or lead the military"" lines if he wins. If Gingrich pulls this off? Wow. Much less sure. Brian Lemieux: Thanks for the answer Dave, I also wonder what a protracted primary between Mitt and Newt would do ... months of trying to prove who hates Obama more would make it harder for Mitt to tack back to ""Obama's a good guy"" if he wins the nomination. _______________________ Thomas F Schaller: Hey John, hey Dave: My thought was Paul was the big loser last night. No? John Dickerson: Hey Tom. I think Paul has his own weather. His supporters love him and nothing he did in the debates will hurt him. Can he grow his vote? That has always been his problem. I'm not sure a debate one way or the other can help him with that. I thought going into the debate that he might be a top finisher in Iowa and I still do. Thomas F Schaller: Has his own weather--love that. I of course don't think he lost any of his devotees. ... I just wonder if any of his recent movement in IA got stunted as he (finally) came under a bit of attack and found himself giving answers on Iran and Supreme Court justices that may not sit well with non-Paulites. ps: have a good holiday season. Dave Weigel: Thomas--yes, the take I was getting from non-aligned Republican strategists was that Paul blew it by being ... Ron Paul. He'd been picking up support among Republicans by running on life, deregulation, etc. and etc. When I was in his Iowa HQ yesterday, I noticed that he had 14 pieces of campaign literature, and almost nothing about foreign policy. And yet he took a series of big, fat swings on foreign policy that sounded--even if you agree with him--unpresidential. If you're a conservative Republican imagining the guy in the White House, part of the fantasy is a strong (sigh, Reagan-esque) commander in chief. Despite being a veteran with, I think, a very defensible America First theory of the world, Paul didn't broadcast anything like the fantasy. Thomas F Schaller: Thx, Dave. _______________________ Brian Ries: Will Ron Paul see a direct bump in the polls for his fiery criticism of Michele Bachmann's Iranian warmongering? John Dickerson: Brian I'd be surprised if the GOP primary and caucus voters who pick their candidates based on their anti-war views have not already discovered Ron Paul. _______________________ Pat Wente: Is the anybody-but-Romney just an anti-Mormon stance? If anyone embodies family values, living your religion, and free market capitalism it's Romney. Yet he's behind Newt? So you think the GOP's chickens have come to roost, as it were? If you court the middle-class fundamentalists with your faux family values stance and lure them into voting against their economic interests, should you be surprised to learn that their Sunday night prayer meetings have included months-long programs on the evils of the Mormon cultists? John Dickerson: Pat, I'm not sure about the Mormon thing. Clearly it's a thing with some evangelicals. But they have so many other reasons to dislike Romney. Changing positions for political reasons (the rap against Romney) is among the most toxic problems in politics. How do we know? It's one of the critiques that Romney is launching at Gingrich. Pat Wente: Thanks, John. _______________________ Josh Krantz: The oppo file on Gingrich is huge, so why does Romney seem averse to going negative? Dave Weigel: He's not averse at all! I point you to the ad Romney's super PACE--sorry, the TOTALLY NOT ALIGNED super PAC--is now running in Iowa. I heard it many times when there this week. At this point Romney's team is only using stuff in the public record, not pioneering new Newt attacks. To a pretty large degree, they're letting attacks get tested in the media, especially conservative media, before they shoot. But that's still negative! John Dickerson: Josh, Romney has been going negative and will again if Gingrich wins some contests. Romney didn't go negative last night because a) it can look unattractive in a debate, b) it makes Newt stronger and c) might not be necessary because Gingrich is already falling _______________________ Beth Young: Will they all sign a pledge to the American People that they will not allow the payroll tax cut to expire? It will save each taxpayer $1,000 on average. Beth Young: Will they have to give up their No Taxes mantra if they let the payroll tax expire? Dave Weigel: Beth--nope, they will not sign anything like that. It's not in their interest to defend the president in any way. It's actually a bit surprising that Romney has given some cover to the Democrats' plan. But the payroll tax debate represents a big lurch to the right (in terms of what's desirable/actionable in Congress), so the GOP candidates hardly need to say more. _______________________ Brian Shortt: I know it's early to start the expectations game, but are any of the early primaries ""do or die"" for the candidates? I figure Huntsman has to do better than expected in NH to continue, while Paul will go on regardless of results. What about the others? John Dickerson: Brian you're right about Huntsman. Bachmann has to do well in IA. Perry has money to live to SC but if he can't do something there he's done. Romney has to do very well in NH. Dave Weigel: Brian--about the ""do or die"" thing ... I'd say Bachmann needs to place in the top three in Iowa (where, she likes to remind us, she was born) or she's out. Santorum and Perry could muddle on to South Carolina, but I don't see how Santorum lasts past SC (where he's got a nice network). Perry, if he doesn't break out by then, is on life support, just as Fred Thompson was at the same point in 2008. And it's really over for John Huntsman if he doesn't shock us with second place in New Hampshire. Brian Shortt: Thanks John. I'm sure every primary has the same pattern of one candidate racing to a lead and then falling back to the pack or out altogether, but it seems more like whack-a-mole than any others I can recall. Have you seen it to this extent in campaigns you've previously covered and does it make it easier or harder (or is it just different)? It has to be more interesting than if Romney was just walking away with it. John Dickerson: '96 is the closest I can think of on the Republican side but it wasn't like this. In '96 there was a Forbes moment, a Buchanan moment and an Alexander moment but it wasn't debate fueled and news cycle fueled like this race has been. _______________________ Liam Murray: As a UK observer it's strange to see only 1 broadly centrist/mainstream Republican (Romney) in a sort of ""tag team"" primary with 5 or 6 others of more ideological bent, each getting their turn but ultimately receding. Was there nobody else seriously challenging for that ""serious candidate"" hat? Feels like Huntsman came closest but other than that .... Dave Weigel: Liam, did you pay much attention to the 2001 open party primary that ended up electing Iain Duncan Smith as Tory leader? This is like that, except obviously much more chaotic. The Republican base views ""serious"" and ""moderate"" as code words for the media forcing loser candidates who won't challenge Barack Obama on what they see as massive socialism. This is why Huntsman hasn't taken off. Even if he does well in New Hampshire, no one can explain to me how he'll survive in South Carolina and Florida, closed primaries with extremely radicalized GOP voters. John Dickerson: Everyone read Weigel's answer to Liam above. Liam Murray: Thanks Dave. Interesting comparison with IDS because he lasted only a couple of years of course and never even got to fight an election, largely because even the Tories who warmed to him initially realized he didn't have a chance of beating Blair. Even his replacement--Michael Howard--was widely seen as a placeholder for the younger Cameron post 2005 defeat. I guess my point is as soon as you hit a real campaign it'll become clear that ""moderate"" isn't ""code"" for anything; it's a straightforward way of saying the broader US electorate won't elect an extreme from either party. Liam Murray: I don't doubt the idea that the GOP base dismisses 'moderate' or 'sensible' as 'lamestream media code' for the exact sort of candidate they DON'T want but there's a question around why that's the case? Why they've become so distrustful of the centre. This Guardian piece on Fox News perhaps speaks to why.... _______________________ Roland Paquette: Wouldn't anyone like to know if Newt has had connections with former Chief Executive Officer Daniel H. Mudd, former Chief Risk Officer Enrico Dallavecchia, and former Executive Vice President of Fannie Mae's Single Family Mortgage business, Thomas A. Lund--who were named in the SEC's complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The SEC also charged three former Freddie Mac executives--former Chairman of the Board and CEO Richard F. Syron, former Executive Vice President and Chief Business Officer Patricia L. Cook, and former Executive Vice President for the Single Family Guarantee business Donald J. Bisenius--in a separate complaint filed in the same court. Roland Paquette: Personally, I think if anyone can tie Newt to corruption at Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, of which there is plenty to go around, he's toast. Dave Weigel: Roland--a fair question! The Freddie execs who might have benefited from Gingrich's ""historical advice"" have not rushed to microphones to explain what actually happened. Microphones became even scarier-looking to them today. This would be a fair line of questioning for Gingrich in an interview. Roland Paquette: Thanks Dave...Exactly why I posed the question. I am hoping someone asks the tough questions. _______________________ Dan Fagnant: Who has the most to gain from a stronger than expected Iowa showing and how well must Bachmann and Santorum finish in order to keep their campaigns alive post Iowa? Dave Weigel: Dan--great question, because the media plays an outsized role in determining who ""won."" It's based on who the conventional wisdom expected to win the day before the vote. I'd say that Rick Perry has the most to gain if, say, he pulls a surprise third place in the caucus. He's tightened up his debate performances, he has a national fundraising network (even if it's Texas-heavy), he has Super PAC support. He'd have just pulled an upset--even if it was weaker than you might have expected from him a month ago--and positioned himself as a serious candidate when the Southern primaries begin. I'd say Santorum has the least to gain even if he does well, because frankly (with apologies to Newt) the press expects social-issues-first candidates to outperform in caucuses. _______________________ Eric Anderson: With proportional primaries, can any candidate have a breakthrough win? Or as Romney has hinted, will this be a long slog? John Dickerson: Eric, yes! Assuming that the candidate has money and to a lesser extent organization, but I am not sure who that candidate would be. You could imagine a late dash into the contest by some superman candidate but that's mostly a fantasy of column writers Dave Weigel: Eric--glad you asked, because this is a common misconception. The GOP will NOT have proportional primaries the way the Democrats did in 2008. States holding primaries before April 1 will award delegates proportionately, but not with the rounding system that Democrats used in 2008. That system ended up spotting Barack Obama a lot of votes. The response of many states to the PR rule has been to push the primaries back. I'm watching PR and think it can keep the race going past February, but I don't imagine it'll prevent any candidate from winning fairly early. _______________________ Alex Saltzberg: What happened to the Telemundo debate? Dave Weigel: Alex--it went nowhere. You didn't ask about this, but a similar Hispanic voter-focused debate skedded for Univision fell apart because Republicans pulled out, claiming to protest a hit piece that the network was running on Marco Rubio. Yes. Missed opportunities. _______________________ Chad E. Burns: With the space between now and Iowa and Gingrich's current trend, does having the debate break and holiday distraction help or harm his lead? Does it help someone else at his expense? John Dickerson: Chad, good question. I think it could go either way. If the negative ads and the general attacks against Gingrich are biting then he has no way to defend himself that will punch through the holidays and get to voters. On the other hand if Romney has to knock Gingrich back, with every passing day that he can't do it the attention span of voters disappears into the eggnog and the holiday wrapping paper. _______________________ Ben Florsheim: How is the Santorum Surge Watch looking? Dave Weigel: Ben--I've moved on to anticipation of a Perry surge watch! The search for the surge is largely an audit of campaign coverage looking for a reason that candidate X may surge, and I haven't seen much of that for Santorum lately. If you see it, though ... _______________________ John Dickerson: Okay they're kicking me out of my hotel room. The laptop didn't blow up at least. Thanks for your questions everyone! Dave Weigel: That was fun! Thanks for commenting, and please keep nagging/tipping me off at the usual Slate digs. Pat Wente: This was a great exchange. Thanks to all!"	Iowa GOP Debate: Dickerson and Weigel Chat With Readers About the Iowa Caucuses

He is responsible for a sizable portion of the potentially illuminating attention that's being lavished on his religion. But his presence also shapes the conversation about Mormonism to such a degree that even a significant sociological document like Pew's ""Mormons in America""--the first ""nationally representative survey focused exclusively on Mormons"" to be published ""by a non-LDS research organization""--can't emerge from the candidate's shadow. (Disclosure: Though I haven't seen Mitt Romney in several years, I spent much of my adolescence at the Romney household, as Mitt's son Ben was one of my best childhood friends.) Consider this AP story, which mentions Romney in the second paragraph and largely considers Mormonism in light of electoral politics. ""About 77 percent of Mormons in the survey identify with or lean toward the Republican Party,"" the AP reports, and most hold much stronger conservative views than the general public. Three-quarters support a smaller government that provides fewer services. The same percentage say having an abortion is morally wrong. Two-thirds believe homosexuality should be discouraged. While these facts are worth noting, the Pew report, read more closely, complicates the identification of Mormons with the Republican Party, and highlights aspects of the faith that most Americans are likely unaware of. For instance: Nearly as many Mormons said that ""working to help the poor"" is essential to being a ""good Mormon"" (73 percent) as believing ""Joseph Smith saw God the Father and Jesus Christ"" (80 percent). By contrast, just less than half of Mormons believe that abstaining from coffee and tea is essential to being a good Mormon, and 32 percent rate ""not watching R-rated movies"" as essential. Those familiar with the Mormon ""Law of Consecration"" will be less surprised at this result than those whose knowledge of Mormons comes primarily from following the Republican primaries. That law is laid out in one of the major Mormon scriptures, a book of modern revelations called the Doctrine & Covenants, in which Joseph Smith is instructed by God that ""thou wilt remember the poor, and consecrate of thy properties for their support that which thou hast to impart unto them, with a covenant and a deed which cannot be broken."" This revelation led to the establishment of a communitarian system among the early Mormons called the United Order. That experiment didn't last long, but the Law of Consecration is still invoked by Mormons in, for instance, discussions of the church's welfare program. Whatever Mormons may think about the U.S. government's welfare system, a portion of their church tithing does fund a welfare program specifically for other Mormons--and this, too, may influence Mormon attitudes about the importance of helping the poor. I also wonder if those attitudes inform LDS opinions on immigration: Mormons, as the Pew survey demonstrates, have a more positive impression of new immigrants than what you might expect from such a conservative group. Forty-five percent say that ""immigrants strengthen the U.S. because of their hard work and talents,"" while 41 percent believe they ""burden the U.S. by taking American jobs, housing and health care."" On a conference call this morning, a Pew researcher said that there is a link between serving a Mormon mission and having a positive impression of immigrants. Again, those who have followed the church won't be surprised by this. Last spring, church authorities publicly supported a comprehensive immigration reform bill in Utah that was opposed by anti-immigration activists. In June, the church issued a statement declaring that the ""Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is concerned that any state legislation that only contains enforcement provisions is likely to fall short of the high moral standard of treating each other as children of God."" But for those who have equated the positions of Mitt Romney or the Republican Party with those of all Mormons, this attitude toward immigration may seem unexpected. (Romney himself is, unsurprisingly, hugely popular among Mormons, according to the survey: 86 percent of the respondents who were also registered voters viewed him favorably. Only 50 percent of those respondents like Jon Huntsman, the other Mormon presidential candidate--and just 22 percent like Harry Reid, the Democratic senator from Nevada, also a Mormon.) Even for experts on Mormonism, the whole survey is worth reading. Who would have guessed that Mormons were more likely to view yoga as ""a spiritual practice"" than other Americans (27 percent vs. 24 percent)? And while ""the way Mormons are portrayed on TV and in the movies"" is largely seen as detrimental to ""society's image of Mormons,"" a slight majority of Mormons say that ""news coverage of Mormonism is fair."" If it's read as more than just a survey of Mitt Romney's electoral prospects, the Pew study should make it more so."	Not Every Mormon Holds the Same Beliefs as Mitt Romney
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/moneybox/2012/01/america_for_sale_how_a_private_equity_firm_would_flip_the_united_states_to_china_.html	"Like many large corporations, America is going through a painful transition as it reaches maturity. Growth has stagnated, expenses have soared, and shareholders are getting antsy. While emerging markets offer potential, competitors are rapidly eating away at the United States' market share. Analysts are bearish, with many believing the country is on the decline. Is it time for a leveraged buyout? Probably not. Still, it's a fun thought experiment: What sort of changes and cost-cutting measures would a firm like Mitt Romney's Bain Capital impose if it wanted to buy the country at a discount and refurbish it for a quick, profitable sale to, say, China? Though the United States carries a $15 trillion debt load, if you look past its bloated budget and shaky governance, the country has some valuable assets. America has vast real estate holdings, a productive workforce, reliable cash flows, and a globally recognized brand name. An aggressive private-equity outfit, though, would find a lot to cut and a lot of people to fire. Here's a 10-point plan to get the country shipshape. 1. Streamline the management process. The boys in Washington may be democratically elected, but they can't pass a budget to save their lives. To cut through this morass in the boardroom, we'll get rid of the legislative and judicial branches. Checks and balances worked fine for 200 years, but these days a country must be nimble to compete in the global market. 2. Raise taxes. Sure, it's painful and unpopular, but that's the nature of this business. Those Bush tax cuts were a nice perk in times of plenty, but the United States is leaving too much money on the table. Paul Ryan says it's ""class warfare"" to raise taxes on the rich, and he's right--that's why we should go beyond Obama's proposal and repeal the middle-class portion of the cuts, too. While we're at it, the charitable deduction for income taxes is good politics but terrible management. And why don't churches pay property tax? Time for the IRS to pass the collection plate. 3. Bust the unions. America's organized labor force has been gutted over the last 50 years, with just 7 percent of its private-sector workers still clinging to unions. Breaking up those holdouts will require some canny strategy, but in the meantime, we can take a cue from Scott Walker and John Kasich and revoke public-sector unions' bargaining rights. Suck it up, government workers: Your pain is our investors' gain. Oh, and those initiatives that allow voters to overturn these types of policies? Inefficient, to say the least. Democracy is one of the country's core competencies, but too much of it can lead to uncertainty that scares away the moneybags. 4. Limit exposure to risky foreign markets. America used to be able to invest in sending hundreds of thousands of troops to countries like Iraq and Afghanistan in its quest for global domination. But let's face it: The country's overextended. Iran, you want nukes? Go for it--just keep that oil flowing. Syria, Bahrain--you guys go ahead and crush dissent if you feel like it. Libya just cost us a cool billion, and we're not about to drop another billion trying to build democracy in some other country. North Korea? That's China's problem now. 5. Spiff up the infrastructure. Fully rebuilding America's outdated infrastructure would be prohibitively expensive for our purposes, but a few cosmetic fixes on the cheap could work wonders. That flashy high-speed rail plan that recently petered out? Get it going again. China loves trains. We'll also need to spruce up those decrepit airports. We're trying to woo a foreign buyer here, and anybody who deplanes at JFK is likely to take one look at that dump and re-plane posthaste. 6. Drill, baby, drill. 7. Right-size the operation. Does America really need 50 states? Audit them one by one to find out which ones add value and which are dead weight. We probably can't jettison West Virginia without opening ourselves to border-security issues, but selling off New Mexico, Mississippi, and Alaska--which take in twice as much in federal spending as they provide in revenue--would make the country stronger going forward. There are surely takers out there who could put the land and the people to good use. Singapore, do I hear $5 billion? 8. Hostile takeover of Canada. On the other hand, merging the United States with a resource-rich neighbor could lead to exciting synergies. Mark that as something to explore. 9. Weed out the underperformers. A close look at the balance sheet reveals that three groups are exerting downward pressure on America's bottom line: the poor, the sick, and the elderly. Sure, they have sentimental value, but you can't afford to be a bleeding heart in this business. You think a country with a one-child policy wants to take on $2 trillion in annual entitlement spending? Sorry, Grandma: Start pulling your weight or find some other government to mooch off of. 10. Cut back on education. Children cost more than they provide in the short term. If we were keeping this country forever, then we could talk about these types of pricey R&D investments. But in this case, we're only going to be involved for a handful of years, and we disclaim responsibility for what happens after that. Cutting spending on elementary education would be a $250 billion budget win, and it won't hit the bottom line for another six years. In short, there's great potential in the United States--potential profit, that is. The deal could backfire, and it would be a shame to have to liquidate a nation of 300 million. But risk is part of the game if you want to make big bucks. And if these minor adjustments pay off, the country could soon be back on a path to growth, bringing huge dividends to China."	How a Firm Like Bain Capital Would Fix Up America and Flip It to China
17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/01/mitt_romney_bain_capital_attacks_could_romney_s_rivals_suffer_a_backlash_.html	"BEDFORD, N.H.--Steve Bannon and Rick Tyler stood near the entrance of JD's Tavern, the Manchester Radisson's inexplicably Western-themed ale house. Tyler, a former Newt Gingrich spokesman who now runs the Winning Our Future super-PAC, huddled with a cellphone, identity cloaked under a baseball cap. Bannon, the conservative director and radio host, was dressed and groomed as if he'd just motorcycle-jumped a POW camp fence. When Tyler finished his call, Bannon put another Blackberry in front of him, another number. ""Dana Loesch wants you on her show,"" he said. ""Biggest Tea Party radio show out there. She heard you tonight on my show. She flipped. Call her."" It'd been a few hours since the New York Times ran a story about Tyler's coup. His PAC, newly enriched by $5 million from gambling magnate Sheldon Adelson, had released a 27-minute documentary about Mitt Romney's days at Bain Capital. The film--intended to be the foundation of an ad campaign in South Carolina, telling the state's king-making Republican voters all about Romney's days at Bain Capital--has it all: pulsing soundtrack, scary B-roll of men smoking cigarettes and shaking hands, three-Kleenex interviews with laid-off workers. ""Romney keeps talking about the 100,000 jobs he created,"" said Tyler. ""Those 100,000 jobs were in Mexico. And nobody's been talking about it."" This is the break-the-glass plan for Mitt's GOP opponents: An attack on Romney's brand of capitalism, funded by profits from the Venetian's craps table. On Sunday, I heard Gingrich himself malign Romney as a ""rich [person] figuring out clever legal ways to loot a company, leaving behind 1,700 families without a job."" It was surreal--Republicans aren't known for bashing big business--and it may backfire. On Monday I drove around New Hampshire and heard conservatives struggling to understand it. ""I've known Newt Gingrich since 1994,"" said Laura Ingraham in an interview with Tyler. ""I've never heard Newt make a speech about predatory practices."" ""Newt is using the language of the left in going after Romney on Bain Capital,"" sighed Rush Limbaugh. ""That makes me uncomfortable."" Limbaugh is completely right. The attack on Bain as some lumbering vampire, sucking wealth and mirth out of small towns, is exactly what Ted Kennedy's strategist Bob Shrum used to smack Romney in his 1994 U.S. Senate race. Before the Iowa caucuses, the Democratic National Committee kept showing up at Romney rallies with people laid off from Bain-looted companies. (Let's just use the Gingrich framework, for now.) These attacks from the left didn't get a ton of attention because ""Democratic Party Opposes Wealthy Republican's Business Decisions"" isn't a very interesting story. But a populist, anti-venture capital campaign that's pitched to Republicans? That's something else. When Mitt Romney Came to Town, the PAC's movie, was put together by Jason Killian Meath--a video artist who once worked for Romney. (Meath didn't respond to a request for comment today.) If you hired a documentarian from Occupy Wall Street and told him to make anti-Romney agitprop, he couldn't do better. The movie portrays Romney as a heartless, Brylcreemed supervillain who ""contribut[ed] to the greatest American job loss since World War II."" It starts with imagery of Americans doing nice, American things. Capitalism, we're told, is nice. It's the reason the sun comes up over wheat fields and dads take their kids on hikes. (File footage might be the actual reason.) But Mitt Romney's capitalism is so heinous that it can only be portrayed by the color draining out of an American flag. ""Wall Street's corporate leaders made billions of dollars,"" moans a narrator. ""Their greed was only matched by their willingness to make millions in profits. Nothing was spared. Nothing mattered but greed. This film is about one such raider and his firm."" Cue the interviews with laid-off workers, who describe their health problems and their shattered towns. Romney brought down UniMac, a washing machine company, when Bain cheapened their products. ""Sometimes we'd send a machine out without a part on it,"" admits a shaken Romney survivor named Tommy Jones. ""For Tracy and Tommy Jones,"" says the narrator, ""their brush with Mitt Romney and Bain nearly tore their family apart."" UniMac, KB Toys, every company ""looted"" by Bain would have been fine if Romney hadn't raided it, the film maintains. ""Romney called it creative destruction,"" says the narrator. (You'd never know that the term creative destruction was Joseph Schumpeter's.) After the Tea Party took over the GOP, who thought that Republicans would start attacking laissez faire capitalism? No one, that's who. The GOP's libertarian establishment, taken aback, has only just started defending Romney. The Club for Growth went hard after Gingrich's newfound socialism: ""Attacking Governor Romney for participating in free-market capitalism is just beyond the pale for any purported 'Reagan Conservative.' "" The attack and the pushback are coming too late to make a difference in New Hampshire. No voter thinks Romney will lose here. But when I asked voters about Bain--admittedly, I was asking people who weren't too warm on Romney--I started to hear why the Newt attack could work. ""If I understand it,"" said John O'Brien, a voter who planned to switch from Romney '08 to Huntsman '12, ""he made his money at the expense of other companies. Didn't he? He dismantled them, I think."" In 2008, when he supported Romney, he didn't ask about the Bain years, and until recently, he hadn't thought much about it. But now he's open to the critique. Republicans figured that the post-2008 collapse of trust in authority had been converted very smoothly into distrust for government. But Newt is betting that the distrust of corporate finance, of Wall Street, never really went away. Romney ended his Monday with a rally down the road from Manchester, in Bedford. It was interrupted, like plenty of Romney's rallies, by Occupy protesters. They were pulled away by cops as the candidate scorned them. ""What would you replace America with?"" asked Romney. ""What kind of system would you have?"" It's a great rhetorical question when the choice is freedom or capitalism. But Romney's desperate rivals won't let it remain a simple choice."	Will Voters Buy the New GOP Attacks on Romney's Pro-Business Record?
18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/01/pious_baloney_will_newt_gingrich_s_attack_on_mitt_romney_change_the_new_hampshire_race_.html	"Newt Gingrich spoke for everyone in America when he asked during the NBC News-Facebook New Hampshire debate, ""Can we drop a little bit of the pious baloney?"" Gingrich was talking to Mitt Romney, but let his exasperated call reach President Obama and leaders in Congress and let it ring in the ears of all the GOP candidates on that stage. Newt Gingrich is not immune to the request. Any candidate who says his adultery came in part from loving the country too much knows how to slice that baloney thick and wriggling. Gingrich's call may have been a little rude, but it represents progress. Fifteen debates and finally the exchanges are getting a little more frank, a little more serious, and inching towards some identifiable lines of reason. The candidates are talking about the leadership attributes necessary to be president and pressing each other on their qualities. They are actually debating, owning up to their arguments, and stating them clearly. In prior debates, the candidates merely recited their stump speeches in parallel. Or they sniped over useful things like Mitt Romney's lawn care company. There are two kinds of pious baloney (at least). One is the lunch meat you hurl at your opponents or dish out to cover up a shortcoming. When Gingrich called himself a small businessman during questions over his payments from Freddie Mac, this was pious baloney. He wanted to align himself with the noble, dry-cleaning Mom and Pop to duck being charged as an influence peddler. So too when he inveighed against highly paid Washington commentators, in the last debate, since he was one. This is called politics. Sometimes politics requires a dash of pious baloney during negotiations, public ceremonies, and other times that call for mild prevarication. Mostly, though, it's regrettable and we'd all like to see less of it. Then there is the pious baloney that points to a deep character flaw. It is that posture you take easily, frequently, and dishonestly on all manner of issues because you have no core and you're constantly re-characterizing your motivations and positions. This second type of baloney is what has dogged Romney this entire campaign. Some conservatives don't think he has a core. Romney said in Sunday morning's debate that he's gotten more conservative as he's grown older, but if he has no core, how do voters believe him? It is one thing to be accused of this condition, it is more damaging to mint fresh product during a debate with everyone watching. Hillary Clinton did this in the 2008 primary on the issue of driver's licenses for illegal immigrants. She took two positions during a debate and denied the inconsistency. Romney may have done a version of this on Sunday. When asked about the super PAC ads attacking Gingrich, Romney at first said, ""I haven't seen 'em."" It was a part of his larger effort to distance himself from the attacks being made on his behalf. But moments later he was able to recite, in considerable detail, the exact criticisms in ""the ad I saw."" It didn't seem plausible that a man who was so distanced from these super PAC ads could detail their claims with such specificity. This is where Gingrich's pious baloney charge comes in. Romney was under attack for being malleable. If he'd been such a good governor, Rick Santorum asked, why didn't he run for office again? ""Why did you bail out?"" asked Santorum. ""I go and fight the fight. If it was that important to the people of Massachusetts that you were going to go and fight for them, at least you can stand up."" Under attack for lacking the courage of his convictions, Romney tried to pivot. ""Run again? That would be about me. I was trying to help get the state into the best shape as I possibly could--left the world of politics, went back into business."" This was a whopper and Gingrich called him on it, pointing out at length that Romney didn't suddenly develop a yen for becoming a citizen when he left office in 2007 and started his presidential campaign for the 2008 cycle. This might have sounded like a standard debate about flip-flopping and hypocrisy. Actually it was an important debate about what makes a good leader. When Romney makes the case about Washington politicians who want to get re-elected, he is making a character charge--they are self-dealing careerists--but he is also arguing that the Washington worldview limits them. In the debate the night before, for example, Romney argued that only Washington politicians would call him a mere ""manager"" for having been a CEO. They just didn't understand the world of the real economy and all of the leadership skill it takes to run a business. ""I wish people in Washington had the experience of going out and working in the real economy first, before they went there, and they'd understand some of the real lessons of leadership,"" said Romney, who argues that business experience is a necessary requirement for improving the economy as president. Santorum and Gingrich offer a different kind of leadership. The experience they present entails working within the political system to move the country in their chosen direction. Gingrich has the better case. He's done more, and he offered a strong argument for how you can lead and work with the other party even when you are trying to defeat its leaders in elections. ""As speaker I was negotiating with Bill Clinton. He knew I wanted him to be a one-term president. And we got a lot of things done, including welfare reform ... the first tax cut in 16 years, 4.2 percent unemployment, and four straight years of a balanced budget."" Jon Huntsman's brand of leadership contains Romney-like executive leadership from his time as a governor, and he also made the case that he is not a part of the political class that trades insults and acts for electoral gain. Taking umbrage at Romney's criticism from the night before that he had worked for President Obama as ambassador to China, Huntsman said he was offended that his public service and duty to country was so devalued. It was that kind of attack, he argued, that has made politics a zero-sum game in which nothing gets done. It was his strongest debate so far and the best articulation of his candidacy. It will win him the support of editorial pages, but it's not clear Republicans will reward him for it in the primary on Tuesday. Will any of this talk of leadership and baloney affect the nomination? Romney has a formidable organization and a lot of money. His rivals continue to shine in ways that will make each of them plausible and attractive to voters trying to find an alternative to Mitt Romney, which will lead them to continue to split the vote and give Romney an edge. The attacks may have damaged him a little but they weren't sustained. To overcome his expected win in New Hampshire--which will boost his air of inevitability--his rivals are going to have to make ""pious baloney"" synonymous with Mitt Romney."	"Latest NH Debate: Gingrich Attacks Romney for His ""Pious Baloney"""
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/01/nh_debate_romney_waltzes_through_as_opponents_mystifyingly_attack_each_other_instead.html	"The Romney campaign has the best voodoo operation in American campaign history. This is the only conclusion I can draw after yet another debate in which the front-runner went unscathed. Before the Saturday night debate in Manchester, N.H., Romney's opponents promised they were going to attack him. They had an opportunity, and they didn't take it. This has happened repeatedly throughout the GOP primary season. In some room at the Radisson, aides in Romney fleeces and headdresses must have been controlling things with little dolls. Their only slip-up: It was a little much when they made the Huntsman doll speak Chinese. A little over the top. This piece is being written during the 10-hour intermission between the two debates on the eve of the New Hampshire primary. At this point, while everyone is picking the popcorn out of their teeth, getting some sleep, and still trying to figure out the back and forth between Romney and moderator George Stephanopoulos over contraception, we can declare Mitt Romney the winner by a long shot. Romney's opponents didn't attack. He gave thorough answers and provided one of the lines of the night. During the contraception cul-de-sac he said ""Contraception, it's working fine. Leave it alone."" The audience laughed. Romney once again showed he has learned from doing this before. Repeatedly Romney reminded people that he had worked in the real world. He made it through the contraception debate, which revolved around the question of whether a right to privacy exists in the Constitution, in part by being obtuse about the question. (There is no reason to help the moderator when he's trying to snare you.) He also ignored another question that didn't suit him, instead repeating the strongest part of his stump speech, about the broken soul of the country. The riff was so potent, Gingrich admitted it was a ""good message"" for a campaign. It wasn't supposed to be this way. Newt Gingrich's spokesman called the debate ""fight night."" A longtime Republican strategist said he expected Gingrich to be so aggressive he'd walk onstage with a black robe and scythe. An adviser to Rick Santorum said Romney should wear a flak jacket. Everyone was primed for a fight because Romney needs to be knocked down or he's going to run away with the nomination. His advantage in money and organization is working for him. Newt Gingrich seemed the one most likely to go on the attack. He had been calling Romney a moderate all week and promising to point out where Romney fell short as a conservative on a host of issues. On the Sean Hannity Show earlier in the week he was tough and clear. He even put up a website devoted to Romney's shortcomings. When Gingrich was given two chances to fulfill the promises he had been making, he offered timid critiques. This was striking because he was simultaneously making an argument that he is more bold than Romney. Instead of taking it to his rival, Gingrich on each occasion hid behind mainstream media outlets, quoting from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. The latter is fine for conservatives, but quoting the Times is like quoting Pravda. What makes this particularly odd is that Gingrich's previous role in life was to deliver groin kicks to the mainstream media. If he'd made specific detailed critiques himself, he might have helped viewers understand Romney's flaws. Romney has been derided for his robotlike manner, but it turns out he is human after all. And the human Romney hates Jon Huntsman. When Huntsman challenged him on China, Romney could have let it go. Huntsman is miles behind him in the polls. But he couldn't resist. He said while Huntsman was working for Obama, the others onstage were working to get Republicans elected. Rick Santorum made an effort to define Romney, arguing that he had the right kind of leadership experience and highlighting some of Romney's weaknesses. ""We need a leader,"" Santorum said. ""We don't need a manager."" It wasn't bad, but it wasn't compelling enough to make you repeat it at breakfast. And Romney cannily deflected the idea he is just some technocrat, arguing that Santorum as a Washington politician didn't understand business-world success. There was plenty of attacking between the other non-Romney candidates. At times it felt like a vigorous competition for third place. Ron Paul is getting a fruit basket for Christmas from the Romney family. He attacked everyone else. He called Santorum corrupt; Santorum returned that he was a liar. Gingrich said the same thing in response to Paul's claim he was a draft dodger. Perry said a pox on all of them. Had there been a hammock to relax in, Romney might have enjoyed himself a nap. Though Gingrich and Santorum didn't go after Romney, they did both turn in strong performances. Santorum seemed comfortable at the center of the stage, an upgrade in placement due to his strong Iowa finish. (At the last New Hampshire debate he re-introduced himself to the moderator during the first break because he'd gotten so little attention, saying he was not a ""potted plant."") Gingrich bashed the media to applause and gave a great answer to a question about Afghanistan, explaining why the larger foreign policy stew is so dangerous. Rick Perry, once known for his dismal debate performances, was on point, repeatedly arguing that his opponents represented Washington and Wall Street insiders. Only a Texas outsider can really fix things, he argued. (Shame this Perry didn't show up four months ago). Tomorrow, NBC's David Gregory hosts another debate. It's possible that the also-rans held their fire in tonight's ABC debate because they figured it best to make the harshest case at the last debate, where Romney has limited ability to respond. If they hit him tonight, he would have a chance to clean things up the next day. Or at least that's what the Romney witch doctors convinced them to think. We'll see if they can be as successful with the incantations tomorrow."	NH Debate: Romney's Opponents Attack Each Other, Leave Mitt Unscathed

""This administration is crushing the business community,"" he says at a town hall here, in a rehabbed train station warmed by 150 or so voters and 50 or so reporters. ""WHY? Because they know better!"" This is what I have come to know as the Santorum Q-W-A Maneuver. First comes the rhetorical question. Then comes the WHY?, delivered in a rasp that vacates his lungs. Then--phew!--comes the common-sensical answer. ""The Social Security deficit has been made worse by this president. WHY? Because he's reduced the payroll tax!"" ""There was a push to sign up more people to Medicare. WHY? Because they wanted to get people dependent. They wanted to get you hooked."" Santorum arrived in New Hampshire on Wednesday after a photo-finish Iowa loss to Mitt Romney that might as well have been a win. His crowds in towns like these, 30- or 60-minute rides from Manchester, are never smaller than 100. Some perspective: At a morning rally in Plymouth, not far from here, in another rehabbed train station (converted into a nursing home), only half as many people trekked to hear Newt Gingrich. In the insta-polls that tell the media who and what to cover, Jon Huntsman--who's campaigned here and only here since the summer, making more than 100 stops and countless excruciating jokes about his ""New Hampshire accent""--is tied with Johnny-come-lately Santorum. Over 24 hours, I watched Santorum, Huntsman, and Gingrich sell themselves to New Hampshire voters. It wasn't fair. Winning (or almost winning) one of the early states makes a candidate Serious. In Tilton, I stop into a pizza place near Santorum's event and meet Joe DiBiase, a nice guy with a Bluetooth headset who has just heard the Gospel of Santorum. ""I don't like Romney,"" he says. ""I like that guy who came in second in Ohio, or whatever it was."" This is a cozy, warm place that only really exists in presidential primaries. Nobody expects Santorum to surge and win New Hampshire. When he leaves the Tilton event, pushing through a crush of reporters like Patrick McGoohan trying to escape The Island's prison ball, he gets a question about ""victory"" and blows it off in a totally reasonable way. ""The poll before Iowa had me at 4 percent,"" he says. ""Second [in New Hampshire] would mean a 20-percent rise, but I had a lot more time in Iowa."" Well, yeah. Neither Santorum nor anyone on his campaign team says he'll win. He can only Beat Expectations. So New Hampshire is a sandbox, a demo reel, a way to take batting practice against hard questions before he tries to win South Carolina. How's he doing? It helps to see the other Not Romneys in action. At that morning town hall, Gingrich spoke for 24 long minutes, half-heartedly trying to explain why he's stronger than Santorum--a ""junior partner"" in the Republican revolution. I caught up with Huntsman, very briefly, as he psyched up supporters at his campaign headquarters. (Ominously, it's in the Manchester office space that used to be occupied by the Rudy Giuliani campaign.) ""Psyching up"" is a relative term with Huntsman, who hardly expresses emotion about anything now that he has no reason to trash Iowa anymore. At Hunstman HQ, I spotted former Pennsylvania governor and Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, who shared ballots with Santorum throughout the 1990s, and who never thought of endorsing him. ""I'm a governor-centric guy,"" he explained. ""I say, with enormous respect, it's one thing to give big speeches and vote, but it's another very different quality to articulate a broader vision, implement a plan, build consensus around the plan, and execute."" He rhetorically patted Santorum on the head. ""He got, what, over 6 percent of the registered Republican voters? That's basically what he got."" But just look at what he's doing with it. He's the only lifelong Catholic (Gingrich is a recent convert) in the primary; four years ago, 38 percent of New Hampshire Republican voters were Catholic. Between Huntsman, Romney, and Gingrich, he's the only one who didn't grow up with money or get wealthy in the Bush years. The Q-W-A Maneuver is one of many Santorum rhetorical tricks, habits developed during four Pennsylvania campaigns to stoke social conservatives and convince blue-collar voters that he'd be a great drinking buddy. Other Santorum techniques include the Interactive History, in which he plays a game of charades to re-enact some key period of his life or argument he lost. At a town hall in Brentwood, N.H., he swept his arm to describe the scope of the Monongahela Valley, which he once represented in Congress. ""The river used to be lined with steel mills, as far as you could see,"" he said. ""There's one now. Well, one, and then one or two steel-rolling mills."" At the same event he held up a Sharpie, and told us it was the social security trust fund. ""What did the Federal government do with the money?"" he asked. ""Gone!"" He pointed to an invisible box. ""It's over here, in a file drawer in West Virginia with a piece of paper. We're going to take that piece of paper, and go and get another from--WHO? China."" This is an argument Santorum lost in the 1990s and in 2005. Other, clumsier Republicans have since made him sound more reasonable. ""I don't believe social security is a Ponzi scheme,"" he explained, assuring older voters that he wasn't out to take anything away from them. Somewhere between the Interactive History and the Q-W-A Maneuver is the Pop Quiz. Santorum reserves this for the voters who doubt that he's right, a group that's more numerous in New Hampshire than they were in Iowa. In Brentwood and in Tilton, he saved foreign policy questions for last, then asked a series of questions about Iran-- ""I've focused like a laser on Iran for seven years""--that he had the answers to. Did anyone know where Iran was enriching uranium? Qom, a city of great religious importance (and he could tell you why). Did anyone know when the coming social security eligibility age increase was scheduled? In 1983, ""which shows you how brilliant those guys were. Brilliant politicians!"" The average New Hampshire Republican is seeing this for the first time. It's wearing well so far, even among voters who expect Santorum to lose. ""Romney's gonna take New Hampshire, no question,"" says Kevin Mochen, a retired firefighter. Four years ago, he voted for the man who actually won the state, John McCain. That guy was a war hero, but if we're just talking about politics, Mochen prefers Santorum. ""McCain didn't seem like he was a strong guy, like his father the admiral was,"" says Mochen. ""He wanted to be the friend of everybody."" What does Santorum want? ""I think he wants to be respected."""	Learn To Talk Like Rick Santorum

 With the Iowa caucus on Tuesday, we've reached that time in the campaign cycle when it dawns on the media that the horse race they have been covering all along--candidates' standings in national polls--is not the one that counts. A national lead is nice, but it doesn't mean much unless a candidate can win delegates state by state (just ask Rudy Giuliani). And while the nomination is rarely won in Iowa, it can be lost there (as Howard Dean could tell you). So who will win the caucus? Romney, running slow and steady along the rail? Paul, peaking at the right time? Santorum in a sudden surge? No one knows--especially since statewide polls are notoriously fickle--but that won't stop us from enjoying the race. (For Slate's animation of the national GOP horse race, click here.) In the above animation, each horse is a candidate, with its horizontal position representing that candidate's standing in the Iowa polls. (Mouse over any horse for a picture of the corresponding candidate.) Our starting line is January 2011, when the first major polls of Iowa voters began. The horse's position is the determined by the average of the last three polls, to smooth out the margins of error. The data is adapted from Real Clear Politics' aggregation of Iowa polls."	What the Iowa Caucuses Would Look Like if They Really Were a Horse Race

""We were done weeks ago."" What does he mean? He opens his MacBook Air and clicks on a spreadsheet with information about the 3.5 million glossy campaign documents he's printing up for the ""Ron Paul Super Brochure Precinct Blast."" Eric has started to fill orders for people in later primary states--6,849 for a volunteer in South Carolina, a few hundred for someone in Florida, where Eric lives. (Eric doesn't want to give a last name, as this would ""take credit"" away from project funder Curt Schultz.) Order a batch and you get your name printed on the back, in case you want to mail them to voters. ""It's not hidden, like a Super PAC,"" says Eric. ""It's all transparent."" Everyone in Iowa will tell you that Ron Paul's Iowa campaign isn't Iowan enough. The other campaigns all say it, and reporters speculate about it. It's an important piece of the Iowa-caucus-doesn't-matter-anymore argument we'll hear if Paul wins the caucuses. Unlike so much campaign chatter, this story is true. Talk to the man's supporters--I followed Paul on a north-central Iowa ""whistle stop tour""--and you inevitably run into Minnesotans, South Dakotans, Illinoisans, and Wisconsinites, none of whom can caucus on Tuesday night. You see Indiana license plates on cars with ""LEGALIZE THE CONSTITUTION"" stickers. There are people who drive for half a day or more to hear Ron Paul talk for 20 minutes about noninterventionism, hard money, and Ludwig Von Mises. None of that is new, but now it's strategy. One month ago, before any polls showed Paul leading in Iowa, the campaign started opening offices in the next round of caucus states--Colorado, Minnesota, Maine, North Dakota, Washington. Buzzfeed's Ben Smith followed up with the campaign this week, finding five more state HQs tilling the dirt for Paul, activists versed in the various local Necronomicons of delegate selection. As I followed Paul around, chasing his six-seat plane in a four-seat Chevy Impala, I asked his supporters what they'd do next. In Cedar Rapids, Chris Stolba, 20, and Ian Hollinger, 18, were shooting the breeze about drug policy, waiting for Paul and his son Rand. (Switzerland, they claimed, had no marijuana prohibition. This seemed too good to check.) They were actual Iowans, volunteering with a ""grassroots action center"" to help out Paul. Would they have time to help out Paul in Minnesota, a long but doable drive up the highway? They hoped so, partly because they expected a long campaign. ""I read an article about Romney calling Obama Marie Antoinette, and the Obama campaign calling Romney a multimillionaire,"" said Stolba. ""They're being petty, and they're going to beat each other up so Paul can win."" ""They're the Mr. Potato [Head] candidates,"" laughed Hollinger. Nearby, a 29-year-old Air Force veteran named Andrew Struss gripped copies of Paul's most-recent books. He was talking to Norm and Darlene Stevenson, 86 and 83, newlyweds who'd met in their retirement community, and who'd switched from Huckabee in 2008 to Paul in 2012. Struss had supported Paul all along. ""I drove here from Des Moines, because I couldn't get the signatures there,"" he explained. ""I'll keep driving until I get them."" Struss is from Minnesota and lives and votes in South Dakota. ""I've already signed up to be a precinct captain there,"" he said. Paul and Paul arrived on time, after the crowd had hit 250. Ron Paul gave a shorter version of his classic stump, only mentioning the caucuses as an aside: ""There's a good chance we're going to do very well tomorrow!"" Rand Paul handled the tray of red meat. ""You've got so-called conservative Republican candidates, traipsing around Iowa, who support foreign aid,"" he said. ""There's only one candidate who the Wall Street Journal referred to as 'a statesman whose refusal to compromise is legendary.' "" As his father shook hands, I asked Rand if he, like everyone else in the room, was ready for a long campaign. Would he be stumping for his dad in Kentucky's primary five months from now? ""It just depends on how things go,"" he said. ""I'm definitely going to be in New Hampshire next week."" Another reporter asked him if his father would win the caucuses in Iowa, which make the rest of this easier. ""It looks good."" What if Paul came in second? ""That wouldn't be as good."" The Pauls flew to Cedar Falls, a town of around 40,000. When Northern Iowa University is in session, Paul can draw upward of 500 to a campaign event. On this day, he drew around one-half that many, including some college students--students who aren't actually from Iowa can vote in the caucuses--and a couple of Democrats who wanted to cast anti-war Paul votes. I talked to some ersatz Iowans before running into Paul Foss, who was holding a stack of Super Brochures. Where did I recognize him from? Oh, yes: Florida. For now, Foss was in Iowa helping to turn out votes in Chickasaw County. ""We just got a list of 700 people to contact!"" he reported. When he was done in the Midwest, he'd head back home to Florida, one of Paul's least promising states--he got 3.23 percent of the vote last time--and join the other supporters who'd been prepping for this since mid-2008. ""It moves over to us, verrrrry quickly!"" Right outside of the room--Paul was long gone now--was Justin Gleason, wearing a sweatshirt reading ""Want to know who this Iraq War Vet supports for PRESIDENT?"" Hint: not Barack Obama. ""He didn't actually end the war, if you know the facts,"" said Gleason. ""We still have 17,000 contractors there. If it's not a war, it's a business venture, and I'm not going to support that."" Gleason had come up to Iowa from Maryland, to work in a ""grassroots office"" in a supporter's house. When Iowa was wrapped, he'd go back to his state and help Paul prep for the April 3 primary there. ""They keep saying, 'Oh, he's got a ceiling,' and then they say, 'Oh, it doesn't matter if he wins,' "" said Gleason. ""They can keep on saying that up until he's elected."""	Why Ron Paul Won't Be a One-State Wonder

""He said he was in New Hampshire, because they only pick corn in Iowa. They pick presidents in New Hampshire."" She cluck-cluck-tsked her disapproval of Huntsman. The two of them left the Friedrichs Coffee where I was working, ending my short career as an eavesdropper. They were unhappy, as people hearing unpleasant truths tend to be. The Iowa caucuses will not pick the 2012 Republican nominee. Seriously, they won't. The Iowa caucuses are not binding. They are ""preference polls."" A Republican (or temporary Republican) who shows up at a precinct caucus site Tuesday will declare that she likes one candidate more than any other candidate. The most popular candidates will get more precinct delegates to the March 2012 county conventions. The county conventions will choose delegates to the state convention. Only there, finally, will Republicans pick delegates for the 2012 convention. John McCain basically skipped Iowa in 2008, dropping into the state just before the vote for appearances' sake, eventually coming in fourth place. Nine months later, when Republicans gathered in St. Paul, Minn., he won 40 of the state's 40 delegates. Losing the caucuses, especially if the loss comes after a polling collapse, can ""prove"" your campaign is over. But winning them doesn't guarantee anything. Mike Huckabee finished first in the 2008 caucus ... and got a TV show. On New Year's Day, I drove to Atlantic, Iowa, a smallish town about an hour from Des Moines, for one of the final stops on Mitt Romney's close-out tour. An hour before the governor arrived, the Family Table diner--I will describe it as ""quaint,"" as this makes the swatch of carpet covering a depression in the bathroom floor seem homey--was packed like a rich kid's toy box. Dennis Butler and his wife Marilyn Miller-Butler lucked out with seats near the door. She was a 2008 Obama voter who'd probably caucus for Ron Paul. Neither was very much interested in Romney. ""I'm leaning toward Huntsman,"" said Butler. ""I lean more moderate, generally. I'm pro-choice, and I'm not particularly bothered by gay marriage. I'd like it if they called it something besides marriage, though."" Butler, who served one term as a Republican legislator in the 1970s (he lost to a Democrat in the Watergate wave), liked what Huntsman said about the caucuses. ""I shouldn't agree, because it doesn't behoove an Iowan to do this, but it makes sense to skip here and start in New Hampshire."" While we were talking, the candidate who completely ignored this strategy was a two-and-a-half-hour drive away. Rick Santorum, who will have spent 104 campaign days in Iowa by caucus night, was heading to conservative northwest Iowa in a truck, chauffeured by his stalwart sidekick Chuck Laudner, accompanied by author Brad Thor and radio host Sam Clovis. Unable to teleport across the state--a technological problem, but one that more funding for ethanol could surely fix--I bargained with another reporter to share audio. I heard Clovis introduce Santorum in Sioux City with an odd comparison between caucus-going and The Untouchables, and tell the crowd, ""Vote for your flag! Vote for your country."" Santorum took the microphone. ""This is my 372nd town hall meeting that I've done,"" seeming to second-guess himself on the number. (I've seen him act this out before.) ""I said, you know, the people of Iowa, they're not doing what the national folks are doing, people around the country. They're doing the job of Iowans. You fight to be first. You take this responsibility seriously. You recommend to the nation who you've met, who you've researched, who you've questioned ... having researched these candidates more than any other group of Americans ever will!"" The questions from Santorum's audience were surprisingly specific. One man shamed Santorum for the endorsement he made in his home state's 2004 U.S. Senate primary. ""Arlen Specter,"" grumbled the voter. ""We know where he is today."" ""Yeah, out of the Senate,"" said Santorum. ""Thank God."" He explained, for possibly the 372nd time, that he endorsed Specter over Pat Toomey only to make sure Republicans held the Senate and could confirm judges. (Specter was set to take over the judiciary committee.) This was exactly what the Iowa caucuses were for: Voter by voter, Santorum was explaining himself to cynics, getting taken seriously. Back in Atlantic, Romney had nothing to prove and few skeptics to prove it to. By the time he showed up, around 2:40 p.m., the diner contained more media than voters. So many TV cameras had been set up in a larger dining room that humans couldn't actually use it, so Romney couldn't speak there. The candidate perched on a stool--much better for cameras, anyway--and gave a 10-minute version of his stump, with more actual policy than usual. ""We learn today that Iran has developed a nuclear rod, they say, for purposes of their power system,"" said Romney. ""Of course, it's also a device that can be transformed into weaponry. They've also announced that they've tested a surface-to-air missile. This president came in with his own plan for Iran. He was going to engage with Iran. He was going to meet with Ahmadinejad."" He sneered the two verbs, as if Obama's stupidity was churning up his stomach. Romney met the diners one on one, chased by cameras fighting for comically bad views--lots of audio of the candidate, framed by the backs of voters' heads. When he was done, Romney's staff let the press know that he'd be taking on-camera questions, and a Three Stooges rush filled the doorways leading to the over-laden dining room of cameras. The fastest reporters got table space to plant their laptops. The cameramen shouted (politely) for everyone without a camera to ""get down."" And then we waited. Photographers, cross-legged at the front of the room, commented on all of this with barnyard noise. ""Moooo!"" they said. ""Moooo!"" Romney arrived, game for five questions, one about why Republicans should choose him and not Santorum (""I'm a businessman,"" of course), some about whether he'd blown it by not campaigning more like Santorum. ""Social conservatives here say you didn't spend enough time reaching out to them,"" said CNN's Joe Johns. ""Do you have any regrets, especially given the Santorum surge?"" ""I've had the privilege of going across the state,"" said Romney, ""and meeting people across Iowa, the last time around, and lots of friendships and associations then. A lot of those people still support me, and I've been able to rekindle those friendships."" In other words: Eh, whatever. Romney knew that he'd lucked out, and that Iowa would either give him a win--probably with less than 30 percent of the vote--or that a social conservative would win, and the media would remember that Iowa didn't matter. After Romney finished, I drove to Urbandale, mostly to catch up with the Santorum train. The candidate's headquarters, located in one of America's most anonymous office parks (the same one as Gingrich's), was decorated with a Christmas tree. I looked past the ornaments intermingled with Santorum stickers, over to the table where volunteers could grab talking points for caucus night. Santorum is a favorite of the Tea Party for his efforts fighting corruption and taxpayer abuse in Washington. Sarah Palin said Rick Santorum's ""been consistent in saying we need to slash the federal income tax."" When Rick lost re-election in 2006, it was the worst environment possible for Republicans. I walked out with a volunteer, Nathan, who'd signed up when Santorum placed fourth in the Ames Straw Poll. He pointed out the inflatable bed that Santorum's state campaign chairman Cody Brown used to sleep in. (It was propped up against a window; no snooping required.) ""If we pull off a miracle on Tuesday,"" said Nathan, ""it will be because of him."" Of course Santorum winning Iowa wouldn't be a miracle. It would be a triumph of hard work. But Santorum winning New Hampshire, or Nevada, or South Carolina, or the nomination: Those would be miracles."	Santorum Surges, Romney Shrugs: Why Mitt Isn't Worried About Losing Iowa
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/12/newt_gingrich_in_iowa_big_money_and_negative_ads_are_crushing_him_.html	"ATLANTIC, Iowa - Newt Gingrich invents analogies almost as often as he writes books. On this leg of his Jobs and Growth bus tour, he was comparing Barack Obama's economic policies to an avian breakfast treat. ""It's as though we've tried to make hard boiled eggs by putting them in the freezer,"" he told a packed, eager room at Tish's Restaurant, a classy joint in Council Bluffs. (Try the fried cauliflower.) ""Now, you can get a hard egg by putting it in the freezer long enough, but it's not what you want. I think Obama is in relation to jobs as putting an egg in the freezer is to getting a hard-boiled egg."" It's a nice analogy. But you could just as easily apply it to Newt 2012, and the weirdly positive campaign he's now running. One month ago, the candidate cited the polls showing him up in Iowa, up everywhere except New Hampshire, and told ABC News he was ""going to be the nominee."" ""I don't object if people want to attack me,"" he told Jake Tapper. ""That's their right."" Now he's trailing, in Iowa and nationally. We know why. He's been bludgeoned by negative TV ads and negative mail. According to the obscure-until-yesterday Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group, 45 percent of all TV ads in Iowa have been anti-Gingrich. Nobody doubts this figure, least of all Gingrich. On Friday and Saturday, stumping in central and western Iowa, he spoke often about the negative campaign against him. Here in Atlantic, he used the ""45 percent"" number, telling us he ""read it in USA Today."" At other events, he opted to scold Mitt Romney and anyone who would let a ""super PAC,"" with mysterious and unlimited funds, tear a man down. Gingrich says he will not run attack ads, despite the challenges he's facing. Let all those other guys make their hard boiled eggs with heat, because he's going to the freezer. ""I propose a simple test, to determine whether or not something is a negative ad,"" he said in Council Bluffs. ""Candidates ought to make grandchildren watch the ads they're running. If they're not proud of those ads, they shouldn't run them."" Whenever Gingrich said this, his crowds--all of them large, if not Romney-huge--cheered as though the candidate had announced some miracle cure for tuberculosis. It was unfair, what was happening to their candidate. It was sleazy. ""I just hate it, and there's so much of it,"" sighed Sarah Hoffman, after Gingrich spoke at a restaurant in Shenandoah, Iowa. ""Anytime they do anything negative, I just turn it off."" ""I think there ought to be a review panel, or something like that,"" said Kelly King, waiting for a chance to shake Gingrich's hand in Council Bluffs. ""You shouldn't be allowed to run these things that are totally negative and wrong."" There are a couple of problems with these complaints. One: Negative ads are part of any campaign, and rightly so, because candidates don't dish ugly (and sometimes revealing) information about themselves. Two: Conservatives derided campaign finance reform in the 1990s, and cheered the Citizens United decision that paved the way for this year's ad onslaught. For them to complain about campaign spending and secret money funding attacks just isn't ... consistent. ""Negative ads are the coin of the realm,"" mused Wayne Nosbisch, a Hillary Clinton fan-turned-Newt fan in Shenandoah. ""What can you do?"" asked David Overholtzer, a CPA and local GOP activist, after taking in Gingrich's Council Bluffs visit. ""It's free speech."" There we go: That's the conservative position. After two decisions by the John Roberts-led Supreme Court, campaign finance law was shot through with holes that allowed corporations to donate unregulated amounts of money and allowed ""super PACs"" to take unlimited sums and spend them on candidates' behalves. Before he was a candidate, Gingrich was largely satisfied by these outcomes. Unions, he said in a 2010 interview, had always been allowed to spend freely. They were whining because corporations were getting their own golden tickets? When groups like American Crossroads GPS spent freely against Democrats, it was mostly Democrats who complained. Return now to Iowa, where super PACs are responsible for much of the negative stuff Republicans are hearing about their candidates. Ask Republicans if they know who's paying for the attacks in their mail, and they say it's mostly from weird PACs. (""The Committee to Make America Red, White and Blue, or whatever,"" sighed one voter in Creston.) Turn on a radio or TV, leave it on for an hour, and you will hear the Restore Our Future PAC tell voters that Gingrich and Rick Perry ""have a lot of baggage"" and proceed to mention all of their sins against conservatism. The PAC, run by Romney allies, has spent at least $3.4 million in Iowa. Super PACs have spent $5.8 million total in the state. Gingrich, who doesn't have this money, now decries how it's being used. At a Friday campaign stop in Des Moines, he repeated an old idea to allow infinite contributions to campaigns, but with immediate and full disclosure about who's donating to whom--not what's required post-Citizens United. The man who once provided Republicans with lists of extra-negative words with which to humiliate soft liberals (""pathetic,"" ""radical,"" ""unionized bureaucracy""--classics) has responded to the supers with a call for the high road ""There's a chance that Iowa can send a very interesting signal to the country,"" Gingrich said in Atlantic. ""It will be interesting to see whether, in fact, the people of Iowa decide that they don't like the people who run negative ads, because you could send a tremendous signal to the country that the era of nasty and negative 30-second campaigns is over."" This isn't a strategy. It's the first of Kubler-Ross' stages. It's also odd to hear Newt Gingrich, whose last year in power ended with the impeachment of a president, making the argument. But it's a good argument. People claim that they want an election about ""issues,"" and then the negative attacks come out and they do what the ads tell them to. Mitt Romney is running around the state giving 12-minute speeches that largely consist of patriotic songs and stories about the Olympics. Gingrich is giving probably-too-specific speeches about the ways he'd tinker with the Cabinet and abolish unpatriotic courts. The cash-and-cornpone guy is crushing the ""ideas"" guy. Toward the end of his Atlantic speech, Gingrich suggested a negative ad that wouldn't be offensive. ""If somebody wants to run an ad that says 'Gingrich reformed welfare, and that was the wrong thing to do,' that would be all right,"" he said. The actual negative ads are all about Gingrich's consulting work for Freddie Mac, and his dark flirtations with environmentalism. One supporter, Eleanor Becker, took the microphone in Atlantic to explain the problem. ""You were doing so well in the polls here,"" she said, ""and then the negative ads came out. My husband and I have supported you since you were in Congress. But the negative ads make you think."" He gave her an answer she liked, mostly about how the ads were wrong, but he admitted that he should have done more to explain his Freddie Mac consulting. ""I think we mishandled it,"" he said, ""because we should have understood after the very first debate how big a challenge it was, and that it would not go away."" After the speech, Gingrich told reporters that he would make more ""contrasts"" with the candidates attacking him. The egg might have to be boiled after all. This was just what Becker wanted. ""I think he should set himself straight and answer the questions,"" she said. ""He needs to come back with his answers to those ads."" She swung her fist, as if throwing a punch at the person who attacked Newt. But this is the age of the super PAC. Who's he supposed to hit?"	Big Money and Negative Ads Are Crushing Gingrich in Iowa
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/12/santorum_surge_how_his_spiking_poll_numbers_change_the_race_.html	"CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa--Rick Santorum has been telling you, and telling you, and telling you, and now, finally, you're listening. He paces in front of 60-odd conservatives in a room of the TrueNorth Learning Center, wearing a brown sweater vest, gesticulating, describing how he's been proven right.

""People say, well, when are you gonna get your surge?"" says Santorum. (Some of the ""people"" are the reporters in the back of the room; some are the Iowa conservatives who keep doubting him.) ""Everybody in this race has had their surge, and their bump. Why haven't you had it? I say, I'm gonna get mine the old fashioned way. Actual people who know the candidates coming on board and helping us. Not some media creation. Not some clever line. But actually folks who are taking their time to look at the records, to look at the vision, to look at the character, to look at the courage.""

Santorum has been saying this all year. It stopped sounding ridiculous on Wednesday. A CNN/Time/ORC poll taken before and after Christmas showed Santorum at 16 percent support with registered Iowa Republicans. He'd been in high single digits or low double digits for a while, but 16 percent put him in third place, behind Romney and Paul. Third place meant that the media would take him seriously. So excuse Santorum for gloating.

""People say, when are you gonna get your surge?"" Santorum repeated. ""I say, January 3."" If Santorum is gaining, he is the fifth candidate not named ""Mitt Romney"" to experience an Iowa ""surge."" (That word, which fits so snugly on cable news chirons, is doomed for overuse in horse-race talk.) Four of these candidates have collapsed. Michele Bachmann, who surged first, spent Wednesday night losing her campaign chairman and theorizing that he was bought off. Rick Perry peaked the moment he entered the race, before voters actually listened to him talk. Herman Cain collapsed after a month of sex scandals--although, let's be fair, he told the media he was ""done"" with the scandals after the first week. Newt Gingrich, dive-bombed by ads from the Romney-aligned Restore Our Future PAC, just collapsed back into the low teens, and is reportedly burning $500,000--much of his liquid campaign cash--on some last-ditch positive TV ads.

The only candidate in Iowa who's gained ground and avoided a complete implosion is Ron Paul. Hours before catching Santorum I drove to the offices of GuideOne Insurance, in West Des Moines. Paul was the afternoon speaker for a hundred or so employees. They gathered in the cafeteria, making space for a Christmas tree and a dozen or so TV cameras, to listen.

""It's not that I've gotten to be a better speaker,"" Paul says. He really hasn't. Even as he's moved up in polls, Paul has kept his habit of running sentence after idea after sentence, gluing them all together with ""ands,"" and moving on. ""The message has been the same,"" he says, ""and the message is very important, and the people are looking for a different message. I've been interested in economics for a long time, even when I was studying medicine. I came across a school of economic thought called Austrian economics. It's free markets, is basically what it is. It's different than monetarism, different than Keynesianism, different than socialism. "" The insurers get a 26-minute beginner's tour of economic theory, from a guide who seems to be talking to the advanced class. They learn that keeping military bases in Europe amounts to a ""welfare check to Germany,"" and that the economy would get boosted if the bases were closed. ""Instead of spending their money in Okinawa or in Germany, they'd be spending it here,"" says Paul. The economic crisis would end if we just allowed banks to be liquidated. ""In 1921, they had a depression,"" he says. ""It was bad, it was over in a year."" Some of the insurers use this time to rest their eyes. Some are bent forward, eyes open, as if watching TIE fighters take down the Death Star on an IMAX screen. ""We've been reading his book, End the Fed,"" explains Tom Icatar. His wife Terry nods. Icatar is one of three people who gets to ask Paul a question. Naturally enough, he wants to know how Paul would start breaking down the power of the Federal Reserve. ""I would legalize the Constitution and money,"" says Paul. ""Today, if you take old silver dollars and old American coins and use them as money, you could be in big trouble! If you use them at face value, you could go to jail. But I'd like to legalize competition currencies. It's been done before. The world is competing with currencies all the time--yen, euros."" Paul spends a little grip-and-grab time with the crowd, telling one woman that he won't send her sons to war (""if you want to hire a private army, go ahead""), and heads out for a ""tribute to veterans"" rally where he'll be received like Caesar back from Gaul. I head out to North Liberty, a suburb in the Cedar Rapids/Iowa City metroplex, to catch Romney at a plastic mold manufacturer called Centro, Inc. Trucks and sedans fill every inch of parking space by the road up to the factory; a local cop idles in his car, getting out every minute or so to warn somebody not to try and park in a nearby development. I joined the herd and parked on grass. The Republicans who made it inside, around 300 of them, are confident that they're looking at a future president. They pose for photos with Romney's ""Believe in America"" banner behind them, near machinery and ready-to-ship molds. ""My wife and I have dinner every week with two other couples,"" says Steve Weeber, who proudly tells me that his family has lived in Iowa City since 1847. ""Two are Democrats, two are Republicans. They've been saying that they could vote for Romney, but they could never vote for Gingrich."" Weeber's pleased to learn that I saw Ron Paul (""Heavens, we love Ron Paul!"") and that I'm about to see Santorum (""You'll come away impressed."") But he fears they can't win. I ask whether the electable candidate is conservative enough. Weeber thinks about it. ""Romney satisfies me,"" he says. ""I'm very confident about him when I look at his family. We can talk about all these issues, but when planes crash into the sides of the World Trade Center, when things like that happen, it's character that you want to have in the White House."" Romney takes the stage, introduced by one-time Men's Health cover model Rep. Aaron Schock. ""The Democrats are scared,"" he says. ""Why do you think this campaign bus is the only one being followed by Democratic trailers?"" The Romneys trade jokes about their relationship. Mitt remembers how he knocked one of his future wife's potential suitors out of contention. ""I said, I live closer to Ann,"" he says. ""Let me drive her home."" Ann tells the crowd about her campaign angst, how in 2008, she never wanted to do this again. ""I told Mitt that,"" she says. ""I actually recorded it. But he reminds me that I said that after each birth. I do have five kids."" When Mitt takes back the microphone, he delivers a stump speech totally free of attacks on other candidates. (He left that to Schock, who made an oblique reference to ""some"" who didn't support Paul Ryan's budget.) Romney's speech is pure, patriotic cornpone, without any trace of Tea Party anger: Glenn Beck on Zoloft. ""I'm not looking to transform America into something European,"" Romney promises. ""I'm looking to restore the dreams of patriots."" He wants to prove this. ""I want America to be more like America,"" he says. ""I love the songs of patriotism. Oh beautiful for--oh, beautiful for--oh, beautiful for spacious skies."" He briefly forgot the words to ""America the Beautiful,"" but he rolls on. ""There we go! I know it. Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain. For purple mountain's majesty, above the fruited plain. That about right? There are other verses I like. For example, Oh, beautiful for heroes proved in liberating strife. Our soldiers. How many veterans do we have here?"" The hands go up and the crowd applauds. Romney is safe. He wraps and I head up to Santorum's ""Faith, Family, and Freedom"" rally. Santorum discusses the ""surge"" talk, then points over to his tour banner. ""I think we should change it,"" he apologizes. ""It might better be, Faith plus Family equals Freedom."" This is Santorum's M.O. Other candidates use the questions at town hall forums to pivot, to talk about issues they're comfortable with--to sound moderate. Santorum takes questions as opportunities to explain just how conservative he is. He gets a softball question about energy exploration and brings up the losing fight to explore in ANWR. ""Anybody ever see a picture of ANWR?"" he asks. ""It looks like nothing. It's frozen over 10 months out of the year."" After one man rambles for a bit about how Obama's policies remind him of freedom-choking socialism in Russia and Germany, Santorum hesitates, then sort of agrees. ""You've heard people say, 'He's making the same speeches I heard when I was in Russia,' "" says Santorum, referring to Obama. ""People understand what's at stake.""

At this, his 357th town hall (his count), Santorum only simmers down when he's asked which cabinet departments he'd abolish, saying that's the wrong way to think about it. But the question does remind him that Ron Paul is hopeless. ""Ron Paul says he's gonna eliminate five departments,"" says Santorum. ""He's passed one bill in 25 years."" Santorum wraps up, talking to whoever's left, continuing conversations in the parking lot. The possible caucus-goers grab free popcorn and bottled water with ""Santorum 2012"" labels. Denise Mitchell, one of Santorum's precinct captains in Linn County, had put all of that together, and she'd brought a cake, Iowa mapped out on top in icing.

""I first started paying attention to him, I think, when I heard him on talk radio,"" she says. ""He's serious. He's not going to meet with Donald Trump, or anything like that.""

The irony: Santorum was one of two candidates who agreed to appear at a now-scrapped debate hosted by Trump. Mitchell gives him a pass on that. Romney doesn't seem serious about people like her, and Paul doesn't seem serious at all. That leaves Santorum. He looks as good as he needs to."	How the Santorum Surge in Iowa Changes the Race

Gingrich got off easy, years ago, with an irritating Ali G encounter. (""Ain't there a problem,"" Cohen asked in character, ""that if there is a woman president, they're gonna spend all their time on facials?"") Paul met with Cohen when he was disguised as the very gay, very Austrian fashion reporter Bruno, shooting his 2009 movie.* It didn't go so well. The congressman got to the meeting place--a dark hotel room that could have been decorated by Sasha Grey--and started to answer a question about who designed his suit. The lights blew out. Bruno invited Paul to a bedroom, where the congressman tried to distract himself as his host offered strawberries and grinded his hips to dance music. Then Bruno dropped his pants. Paul, already pacing, barreled past him and yelled ""Get out of here!"" A camera captured Paul ranting as he fled the hotel. ""That guy is queerer than the blazes,"" he said. ""He took his clothes off. He's queer, he's crazy, he put a hit on me, he took his clothes off."" The ""news of the weird"" follow-up coverage came, and Paul rolled with it. When Curtis Sliwa asked about the incident on his radio show, Paul worried that he'd gone a little soft, imagining what one of his supporters would have wanted him to do. ""Why in the world,"" he asked, ""didn't I sock this guy in the nose?"" He was punk'd by let's-make-fun-of-the-old-guy humor. Nobody seemed particularly bothered that a once and future presidential candidate was fuming about a come-on from a ""queer."" That was in 2009. In 2011, the press has discovered--for the third time--the newsletters Paul sold in the years between his failed 1984 Senate bid and his congressional comeback in 1996. They reveal Paul (or his ghostwriter) to be a scared cynic with paranoid thoughts about blacks, gays, and Israel. The comments about black men--including their supposed ""criminal"" tendencies--have attracted wide attention. But the newsletters were often just as vitriolic about gay people, saying they were ""far better off when social pressure forced them to hide their activities."" A ""gay lobby"" suppressed the truth about AIDS, the newsletters claimed. ""I miss the closet,"" groaned Paul-or-his-ghost. Republicans aren't supposed to survive comments like that. Gay activists have ""glitter-bombed"" Michele Bachmann and Newt Gingrich, showering them with sparkles to shame them for their anti-gay rights stances. After Rick Santorum compared gay sex to ""man on dog"" sex, Dan Savage told fans to Google-bomb ""Santorum,"" propagating the idea that it's a Latin-sounding word for ""the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the by-product of anal sex."" That was six years ago. Santorum still gets humiliating questions about it. Nobody grills Paul about this stuff. When I asked Savage about the ugly comments in old Paul Survival Reports, he shrugged them off. ""Ron Paul can have the closet,"" he said. ""He might miss it, but we sure don't. Maybe there's room in there for his old newsletters?"" There is no comparing Paul and Santorum, said Savage, because Paul is a leave-us-alone libertarian. ""Ron is older than my father, far less toxic than Santorum, and, as he isn't beloved of religious conservatives, he isn't out there stoking the hatreds of our social and political enemies,"" he explained. ""And Ron may not like gay people, and may not want to hang out with us or use our toilets, but he's content to leave us the fuck alone and recognizes that gay citizens are entitled to the same rights as all other citizens. Santorum, on the other hand, believes that his bigotry must be given the force of law. That's an important difference."" That's more or less what Paul and his campaign say about all of the newsletters. The man's been in public office, on and off, since 1976. Where's the anti-gay record? In 2004, Paul was one of only 27 House Republicans who voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment. In 2010, he flipped from a ""no"" to a ""yes"" on repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell. ""I have received several calls and visits from constituents who, in spite of the heavy investment in their training, have been forced out of the military simply because they were discovered to be homosexual,"" he explained. ""To me, this seems like an awful waste."" He's worked alongside gay libertarians before. Would-be social conservative kingmakers say they can't back Paul because his federalism would let gay rights flower in the states. ""Sometimes,"" Iowa FAMiLY Leader CEO Bob Vander Plaats said this month, ""his libertarian views trump his moral compass."" Square all of that with the author of the newsletters. In 1989 he approvingly quoted a congressman who said gay rights was not a matter of ""political philosophy,"" but of ""sodomy."" In 1994 he argued that ""those who don't commit sodomy, who don't get blood transfusions, and who don't swap needles, are virtually assured of not getting AIDS unless they are deliberately infected by a malicious gay."" The same year, he doubted that older gays worried too much if they got AIDS; ""sex is the center of their lives,"" he explained, and anyway, ""they enjoy the attention and pity that comes with being sick."" Paul says he didn't write any of this, but another politician couldn't say that and expect gay writers to back off. Paul gets a pass. James Kirchick, the gay reporter who broke the newsletter story in 2008, didn't get the sense that Paul cared as much about this as ""say, the need to root out the Trilateralist-Bilderberg conspiracy."" ""I do think it's possible that he views gays personally with disgust while maintaining a belief that the government should not regulate their lives,"" said Kirchick. ""I actually think that's the case with a lot of straight people, even ostensibly 'liberal' ones who know better not to say what they really think about homosexuality and homosexuals."" So Paul's imperfect. Paul's gay fans, like Andrew Sullivan, admit that much. And Paul's liberal defenders are wrestling with whether to give him a pass on the newsletters. For one thing, they see a strategic advantage to keeping him in the race. Whatever Paul believes personally, the effect of having Ron Paul on those debate stages is to force Republicans to confront federalism and paleolibertarianism. ""The party bosses,"" wrote a giddy John Nichols in The Nation, ""are horrified at the notion that a genuine conservative might grab the Iowa headlines from the false prophets."" Nichols doesn't think he's describing a potential president. None of Paul's liberal defenders do. Savage doesn't. The Republican primary is a running conversation, and it expands or contracts the definition of ""conservatism."" As long as Paul is in the race, it doesn't matter what he might have thought about gay sex once. He wants politicos--people like himself, really--to stay out of the bedroom. One reason he talks like this is that gay rights, culturally, has won out. ""I recently had a conversation with a man about Ron's age who told me that he was uncomfortable with what I do in bed,"" remembered Savage. ""I laughed and promised not to do it to him. He gave me the craziest look and then laughed himself. Apparently, I wasn't the first gay person he'd said this too, but I was the first gay person who didn't get a sad when he told me what he thought about homosexual activities."" And what about Paul? Well, ""1990 was 21 years ago--an eternity in the evolution of attitudes toward gays and lesbians. What has he said about us lately?"" Correction, Dec. 27, 2011: This article originally described the Sacha Baron Cohen character Bruno as German. He is Austrian."	Why Ron Paul's Anti-Gay Newsletters Don't Bother Liberals

At 2:15, House Speaker John Boehner arrived, found his place behind a podium decorated with a jobs.GOP.gov sign, and explained why Republicans had decided not to return the Senate's punt. Instead, they'd chosen to create a new conference committee, to hash out a new compromise, which they hoped to pass at some point. ""This is the system that our founders gave us,"" said Boehner. ""It is as old as our nation and as clear as the Constitution."" ""The president has just said he appealed to you personally,"" asked radio reporter Todd Zwillich. ""He said, 'I need John Boehner to help out.' "" ""I need the president to help out, alright?"" said Boehner. The Republicans around him broke up, laughing and cheering. Zwillich asked his actual question: Why not just vote on the Senate bill? ""We've already taken up the Senate bill,"" he said. ""We just did!"" muttered one off-mike Republican. ""We rejected it,"" said Boehner, ""and we voted to go to conference."" This is not all true, because the vote to go to conference had automatically nixed the Senate bill, and there would be no separate vote on the two-month punt. Washington will have to negotiate a whole new punt, the fourth compromise in a year designed to please no one. (Count 'em down: 2010 tax deal, 2011 continuing resolution, 2011 debt compromise with bonus ""supercommittee."") The mission this time around: Save the payroll tax cut, which will spot the average family around $1000; extend unemployment insurance; and reimburse doctors for Medicare patients. The not-so-secret political goals: Make sure that the other party takes the blame for this, and save as many policy sweeteners as you possibly can. Democrats are good at that first part. Republicans are very good at the second. Oh, it's not like anyone wants to be in this position. ""A lot of us warned last year that we would be in this position,"" moaned Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., talking to reporters between kabuki votes and kabuki debates. ""Just this exact position we're in today, where people are saying, 'Hey, you're raising taxes.' The speaker took pains to say earlier, we were dealt a bad hand. We dealt ourselves this hand last year."" What happened last year was that the House and Senate extended the Bush tax cuts through Jan. 1, 2013 while adding some sweeteners for Democrats: the payroll tax cut and 13 months of unemployment insurance. Republicans got little blame for this, as it was the last act of an expiring Congress run by Democrats. The blame is coming in now. Serendipitously enough, Tuesday's standoff happened right after a new CNN poll pegged Barack Obama's approval rating at its highest level since May, when the killing of Osama bin Laden gifted him with a bounce. The poll asked whether voters had more ""confidence in President Obama or in the Republicans in Congress to deal with the major issues facing the country."" In March, Obama had a 5-point lead. This month, that figure has zoomed up to 19 points. Bill Clinton didn't have a lead that big when the Gingrich Congress was humiliating itself by impeaching him. None of the obvious storylines to come out of this latest congressional skirmish look all that good for Republicans. McConnell punts the fight for two months; House Republicans revolt! The Tea Party overrules John Boehner, yet again. Tea Party members trash the Senate. (""They get distracted with their bingo night,"" snorts Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah.) In the end, we're left with two ugly narratives for the GOP: Republicans are holding tax relief hostage, and Republicans will raise taxes on working people. The Republicans, predictably, resented that characterization. ""The American people are being as played as pawns,"" suggested Rep. Tim Scott, R-S.C., co-president of his freshman class. ""The Democrats are our opponents,"" said Rep. Stephen LaTourette, R-Ohio. ""The Senate is our enemy. I don't know any House Republican who can't go home and say, 'I don't know what that loony Senate is up to.' If you can't say that, you're in the wrong business."" LaTourette, a member of the 1994 class, was well aware of the spin and chaos that the three fights had produced. Yes, endangered Republicans like Sen. Scott Brown were siding with the 2-month plan. Republicans were in disarray. ""Sure,"" said LaTourette, ""but who cares?"" The cynic's bet is that the story of GOP dysfunction won't matter, so long as there's eventually some compromise. Eyes on the prize: If the other side blinks, and it always does, what can Republicans get out of them? They want a few things. The House's version of the one-year extension included reforms that Republicans plan to stick to. On unemployment, the GOP wanted to cut the maximum duration from 99 weeks to 59 weeks and add in some new requirements. Beneficiaries who didn't have GEDs would have to try to get them. States implementing unemployment insurance could require drug tests. These and other reforms were necessary, according to LaTourette, because ""you couldn't get 218 votes that extended unemployment benefits without reform."" In his district, employers were tired of having jobs open but lacking workers with the skills to fill them. Here was a chance to fix that. Also among the House GOP's demands: a hold on new EPA rules governing boilers, and an expedited decision of the Keystone XL pipeline. They were taking those demands to the conference committee. I asked Rep. Fred Upton, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce committee and one of the people going to conference, how these were pertinent. ""Part of our argument of including it in the broad package,"" he said, ""is--look, we're looking at extending unemployment benefits. But frankly, people would rather have a job than get unemployment benefits. The Keystone plan, which has been sitting on the desk for three years--20,000 shovel-ready jobs, $7 billion private investment project--it's ready to go. The boiler rule impacts 200,000 boilers, about that many jobs as well. Ready to go. It's had bipartisan support, and we know it has bipartisan support in the Senate."" Yes, the Republicans are coming off as intransigent. But Democrats want to re-elect the president, so they'll ultimately give up a lot to extend a tax cut and unemployment benefits. In the meantime, Republicans can figure out what leverage they have to weaken the welfare state. Despite how it looks right now, it doesn't make sense to doubt them. After all, they've had a lot of practice at this."	How the House GOP Will Win the Battle Over Payroll Tax
28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/12/callista_gingrich_s_hair_one_woman_replicates_newt_s_wife_s_helmet_head.html	"There's a well-known image of Callista Gingrich in which she and her Newt are at a fancy event and she looks very much like she has a case of the crazies. You know the one? Head tilted, eyes bugging, forced smile. But what seals the deal, of course, is the hair. Platinum blond. Razor sharp on the edges, and molded into a shapely helmet on top. Who has that hair in 2011? What does it feel like to wear your hair that way? And what does it take to get it? Having just undergone a Washington, D.C., salon's best attempt to Callistify me, I now know that hair like that doesn't come easily--in fact, it suggests a certain strength of character on Callista's part that she's able to do that to herself every single day. And I'm much less inclined, now, to judge her for looking a little off-kilter. The fumes from that many products mingled together and swirling around her head must be dizzying. How did I wind up in the Okyo Salon in Georgetown, showing a photo of Callista Gingrich to Pejman, my stylist for the day? Let's just say that I've learned my lesson about sending jokey responses to speculative email threads at Slate. As I sat in the chair, I thought about what having Callista's hair might mean for me. I am no stranger to the bob. In fact I've sported one of various lengths most of my adult life. And blond is normal for me as well. But mine is more of a buttery blond-- I have never been platinum. I have dark eyebrows. And I'm more of a wash-and-go type of girl. I've never had sculpted hair--well, OK, maybe that one time in the '80s, but I have since learned that when the wind blows, so should your hair. Hers, I think, does not. What a huge commitment, to be perfectly coiffed at all times. Imagine the fear she must have of a fire in the night, or simply sitting near an open car window. Like many tony D.C. salons, Okyo sports its fair share of powerful clients, including Nancy Pelosi. (Callista gets her hair done at Andre Chreky on K Street.) But as Pejman eyed my hair and my 8-by-10 Callista glossy, he seemed dubious about giving me the full power-hair treatment. My hair is much thicker, much darker and much healthier than hers, he said, but he'd do his best to make the transformation--on his terms. Going from a dark, yellow blond to platinum is usually done over the course of two or three visits, he said. A gradual coloring is less shocking to the eye and also less damaging to the hair. Since we didn't have two or three visits, he wanted to take a few extra steps to protect my hair. And for that I was grateful. Going platinum was one thing, but going platinum and fried? No, thank you. The color alone took three hours to achieve. Three hours of bleach and gloss and glaze and goop and my head being knocked about left and right. The gloss (or maybe it was the glaze?) burned my scalp; when I mentioned this, Pejman looked right at me and said, ""Beauty tingles."" Then it was time for the cut. As Pejman started to snip and razor and thin, hair fell onto my black salon cape. White hair. As white as snow, it seemed. I gasped. What had I done? But when the seat swiveled back toward the mirror I was dumbfounded. My hair didn't look crazy at all. It actually looked, well, good. The most difficult part was yet to come, however. I braced for the rest of the transformation, where Pejman would tease and curl and spray and shellac and turn me into the most recent Mrs. Gingrich. But it didn't happen. Pejman steadfastly refused. He reminded me that he said he'd do it on his own terms--and his eyes told me there was no way in hell he was going to let me leave his salon looking that way. I stepped onto M Street and I felt my knees buckle just a little. I'm not sure if it was nerves, or the fumes from my new hairdo--the glazes and glosses have a distinct smell, a bouquet of oils and perfumes that could be nice in small doses but were rather intoxicating in the volumes we used--but I needed a moment to steady myself before I began my walk. In all my 40 years, I have never been more aware of my appearance--not even when I was 36 weeks pregnant with twins. To cope, I pretended to be hugely famous. As I walked, I braced for the looks and whispers. Nobody even noticed. I'd spent four hours in a chair, having my hair magnificently bleached, scorched, chemically altered, and cut, and I'd come out with a cute, modern, edgy bob. If Callista could step away from the hairspray, her hair could be soft, smart, cute and young--according to Pejman, a very flattering cut for her features. Why does she do it? To conform to some ideal of the ""Washington wife""? To look older, bridging the age gap between her and Newt? (She's 45; he's 68.) Whatever her reason, a haircut that could be modish and progressive transforms, on her head, into a symbol of stand-by-your-man devotion. She never changes that hairdo of hers. Another salon customer, overhearing our conversation, confided that she's a neighbor of the Gingriches and that Callista's hair looks perfectly done all the time. All. The. Time. Can you imagine? It's like she's a prisoner in her own hair. In the end, I think that my attempt at Callistification has made me admire Callista Gingrich and her awful, but extraordinary, hairdo. It took a huge leap of courage (and hectoring from my editors) for me to get this platinum bob, which, all things considered, isn't that extreme. But out of loyalty or passion or shared (blond) ambition, Callista does all this and more to herself every day. Now that I understand what's behind that helmet, I have a little more respect for the woman who wears it."	What Happened When I Asked a D.C. Salon To Give Me Callista Gingrich's Hair?
29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/12/iowa_republican_debate_romney_and_gingrich_were_both_effective_but_mitt_was_the_big_winner_.html	"There have been so many debates during the Republican preseason that it was hard to believe the one hosted by Fox News in Sioux City, Iowa, was the last one before the voting begins. Ratings have been strong, and commentary has been endless: You can imagine a network trying to squeeze in just one more--are you free on Christmas Eve, Governor? It has been a thrilling debate run: Pawlenty crashed; Perry blanked; Romney confronted Perry; Gingrich shined; 9-9-9; Perry blanked. But the Sioux City debate was not an epic contest. It was like the primary race itself: no dominant figure but with something for Republicans to like in each of the candidates. In a recent New York Times/CBS poll, 66 percent of Iowans said they are still undecided about their final choice. This debate didn't make their job any easier for them. But Iowans must choose, so in that spirit: The winner of the evening was Mitt Romney. His performance was solid and his defense of his flip-flops was better than his chief rival Newt Gingrich's explanation about his work for Freddie Mac. Most importantly, all the other candidates were effective, and Romney benefits more than Gingrich from a broad strong field that splits the vote. Romney regained the form he showed in the early debates, commanding and at ease. Romney made fun of mistakes he made in the private sector (He thought Jet Blue wouldn't work), and he talked about how he learned from his errors. Maybe it's a good thing Gingrich has challenged him. He picked up his game. Gingrich acquitted himself well, too: He was a pugilist, bashing judges, lawyers, Obama's decision on the Keystone pipeline. And he was even self-deprecating, saying at one point that he was ""editing himself"" in his responses so that he might not ""appear zany."" Romney didn't attack Gingrich. His commercials, surrogates, and comments in the paper are softening Gingrich enough. Plus, at this stage in the race--with so little time left--it's a time for candidates to offer voters their closing arguments, the main thrust of their candidacies. Romney focused on his business career, his four experiences as a leader, and  the failures of President Obama. Romney also benefited from his opponent's side skirmishes. Ron Paul and Michele Bachmann attacked Gingrich about the $1.6 million he received from Freddie Mac. ""The speaker had his hand out and he was taking $1.6 million to influence senior Republicans to keep the scam going in Washington,"" said Bachmann.  Gingrich was not at his best in defending himself. He kept having to insist that he never lobbied. His effort to argue a distinction between consulting and lobbying was probably lost on most people. He said he was a private citizen operating in the free enterprise system. ""He has a different definition of the private sector than I have,"" said Paul. Gingrich tried to explain away the problem by making a big picture point about government-sponsored enterprises.  ""There are a lot of government operations that do good things,"" he said at one point--in a way that didn't sound very conservative. Gingrich spent almost five minutes taking the pounding. That's an eternity. Gingrich clearly has a problem with Michele Bachmann. He has called her a dummy a few times, and he treated her like one at the debate, repeatedly saying that she ""didn't have her facts straight"" when she attacked him for not being sufficiently pro-life and about his record at Fannie. A thrice-married candidate might want to improve or hide the obvious disdain he has for the one woman in the field. In the most recent NBC poll, women have a 38 percent negative view of Gingrich. Only 20 percent of women have a positive view. Bachmann was relentless saying that conservatives couldn't be weak on the issue of abortion. And she hit hard when Gingrich questioned her facts yet again. ""I think it's outrageous to continue to say over and over through the debate that I don't have my facts right. When as a matter of fact, I do. I'm a serious candidate for president of the United States. And my facts are accurate."" This was a very good moment for Bachmann. Unfortunately, Gingrich was validated by the fact checkers. Bachmann, in defending herself, said that Polifact had come out and said that everything she had said was true. Politifact labeled that claim as ""pants on fire,"" its most  negative rating. Romney benefited from having his troubling issues come at the end of the debate after people had either tuned out or after he'd established himself as a strong presence. Gingrich had the opposite problem. His best part of the debate came at the end. He defended his criticisms of the judiciary with a judge and lawyer-bashing riff that no doubt will please base voters. Asked about the Republican attorneys general who disagree with him, Gingrich said ""as lawyers those two attorneys general are behaving exactly like law schools, which have overly empowered lawyers to think that they can dictate to the rest of us."" Just before the debate, Iowa's popular Republican Gov. Terry Brandstad had said he didn't know whether Gingrich had the discipline to be president. With that in mind, Gingrich smiled and showed very little of the scowl that is so often his boon companion.  ""You know, Neil, I sometimes get accused of using language that's too strong,"" he said when asked a question, ""so I've been standing here editing. I'm very concerned about not appearing to be zany."" He then uncorked a crowd-pleaser about president Obama's refusal to approve the any efforts to tie a payroll tax cut extension to reopening the Keystone pipeline. Everyone seemed to have a good night. Ron Paul hit all the familiar points. Rick Perry declared himself the ""Tim Tebow"" of Iowa, didn't gaffe, gave forceful praise to the 10th amendment, and received rousing applause when he called for a part-time Congress. Rick Santorum had another  solid performance. If Gingrich's support drops after the deluge of attacks, these candidates are all in a position to benefit. This all helps Mitt Romney. If the competition splits the vote, then no clear alternative to Romney will emerge from Iowa to challenge him in later states. If that happens, he'll win the nomination and we'll be right back where conventional wisdom predicted we'd be."	The Final GOP debate: Did Michele Bachmann and Ron Paul Just Save Romney's Campaign?
