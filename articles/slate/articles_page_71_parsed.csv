""This is the Iron Dome guy? That's him speaking?""

""I think that's him!""

A hundred-odd ""pro-Israel lobbyists,"" as the official literature calls them, gather around a small stage in the AIPAC Village. There are several of these stages. It's a large ""village,"" located at the bottom of the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, in a room that stretches underneath three city blocks. To get there, you walk past the ads that repurpose the old Uncle Sam recruitment photos with a new slogan: ""I want YOU to be on time for your lobbying appointment."" Six weeks ago, this was the site of the largest inaugural ball in modern history. The floor was bare concrete, and the hors d'oeuvres were Cheez-Its and pretzels served in ornate metal bowls. Today, for the annual American-Israeli Public Affairs Committee conference, the room is carpeted, and the kosher refreshments are served from ersatz ""food trucks."" Higher-dollar donors head into pavilions at the north and south ends of the room, where they can kibitz with members of Congress and former diplomats. (AIPAC offers special recognitions for donations up to $2 million.) Lower-dollar donors can check out the technological ""showcase,"" products invented by Israelis and now ready for American soldiers, drivers, or households. Case in point: a presentation by retired Brig. Gen. Danny Gold. In 2005, when he ran the Israeli Defense Force's weapons and R&D shop, Gold advocated for a short-range defense system that could scan for missiles, predict their targets, and destroy them in flight. Within five years, Iron Dome was getting the funding it needed. In 2012, it knocked out 84 percent of the missiles shot from the Gaza strip. Gold tells the story in a thick accent, giving credit to Israeli's scientists--and giving some credit to the Obama administration, which presided over $275 million of funding for Iron Dome. Shoshana Marcus, a donor and Hebrew teacher who lives in Maryland, lifts her iPhone above the crowd. ""I want to take a picture,"" she says. ""This is the man who saved my grandchildren! I've got grandchildren who live in Israel."" If Gold saved her grandchildren, and the Obama administration bankrolled that rescue mission, who gets the kudos? That question will be asked and re-asked of the 12,000-plus AIPAC donors who've come to D.C. this weekend. Jewish panic about Barack Obama was the dog that never barked, not during the 2008 campaign, not even after the 2012 campaign. When Obama picked Chuck Hagel to lead the Pentagon, Republicans saw a test for AIPAC. Would America's ""pro-Israel lobby"" throw its weight and conspicuous money against a man who'd accused ""the Jewish lobby"" of ""intimidating a lot of people"" into unwise votes? No, it wouldn't. AIPAC stayed out, pointing out that it never got involved in nomination spats. Hawkish pro-Israel groups, with infinitely less clout, tried and failed to pinch-hit. At a pre-AIPAC happy hour, on Saturday, some of the activists who'd manned the guns remained bitter. ""They existed to stop something like the Hagel nomination,"" one of them told me. ""What vote's going to come up that's more important than Hagel? What's more important than saying: No, you can't do what Hagel's done and expect to ever get a defense role?"" The anger spilled out from AIPAC donors, and it was channeled in pro-Israel punditry. ""Had the American Israel Public Affairs Committee opposed Hagel publicly,"" wrote Washington Post blogger Jennifer Rubin in her 73rd and final post chronicling the nomination, ""I do not think he would have been confirmed."" But AIPAC rank and file have moved on. ""I was not happy about Hagel, but a lot of people are saying that he's going to be different than what he used to be,"" says Shoshana Marcus.* ""Israel produces a lot of technology. The United States gives the means to produce it. Someone like Hagel, he's going to learn that aiding Israel is to the United States' benefit. Is President Obama always pro-Israel? No. I don't think so. But he does the right things."" This, with a little less angst, was the Obama-Biden campaign's 2012 pitch to wayward Jews. At his defensive 2012 speech to AIPAC, the president asked lobbyists to ignore his gaffes and look at the balance sheet. ""The fact is, my administration's commitment to Israel's security has been unprecedented,"" he said. ""If during this political season you hear some questions regarding my administration's support for Israel, remember that it's not backed up by the facts."" The Obama campaign wanted Jewish voters to think about Iron Dome. One year later, Iron Dome was mentioned so often at AIPAC's conference that Tablet put it at the top of its AIPAC Bingo card. Hagel was mentioned once, when Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak wished him ""all the best."" (Barak was the first foreign counterpart to get a meeting with newly installed Secretary Hagel.) ""I trust President Obama,"" said Joyce Wolf, an AIPAC donor from Michigan. ""If Hagel really had a black heart, the president wouldn't have nominated him."" Any residual Hagel bitterness, if it existed, was kept behind closed and carefully guarded doors. Conference organizers restricted media access to most breakout sessions, including every session involving a current member of Congress. No reporter could watch the leaders of the House Foreign Relations Committee debrief on the year to come; none could watch Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who spent the last month asking for records of old Hagel speeches, speak at a town hall about ""how members of Congress experience Israel."" No, Republicans had to be subtle with their Hagel-bashing. Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the Republican whip in the Senate--a man who deserves credit for the first, ultimately vain Hagel filibuster--never mentions the nominee. He just mentions that he, John Cornyn, ""supported every single piece of pro-Israel legislation,"" unlike some people. ""I know some U.S. officials have called for greater engagement with Hamas,"" says Cornyn. I scan the rows, the thousands of AIPAC lobbyists-for-a-week, and saw wry smiles. I see more of them when Sen. John McCain, steamrolling New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand in a short policy panel, says, ""We need members of the national security team who are pro-Israel, not anti-Israel."" It's not like the ""Israel lobby"" disagrees with that. Its leaders simply decided that it wasn't worth challenging a nominee for secretary of defense and losing. Did they want to make a statement, or did they want to keep the aid and research dollars flowing? At a ""town hall"" about the U.S.-Israel relationship, Union College Professor Stephen Berk reminds skeptics that ""Richard Nixon said some hateful things about Jewish people"" right before he re-armed Israel during the Yom Kippur War. Barack Obama said the wrong things, but they weren't going to pressure him by undermining him. The president missed AIPAC this year--no great scandal, since he's making his first in-office trip to Israel later this month. He dispatched Vice President Biden, a font of stories about the Israeli prime ministers he's known, a pol who knows which words do and do not spook the lobby. Biden appears onstage to the strains of ""Hail to the Chief,"" and runs over to hug Ehud Barak, as outgoing AIPAC president Michael Kassen preps his introduction. ""Because of this administration's dedication to Israel,"" says Michael Kassen, ""more than $400 million has been invested in Iron Dome."" Biden talks for more than 30 minutes, acknowledging that ""we've always disagreed on tactics,"" but moving right on to the good stuff. ""I don't have to explain [the Iron Dome] to anybody anymore,"" he says. ""Everybody saw, the world saw!"" Correction, March 5, 2013: This article originally attributed a quotation to Shoshana Gold.

1	1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/02/phelim_mcaleer_s_fracknation_conservatives_now_have_their_own_movies_about.html	"On Tuesday afternoon, around 40 Republican staffers and members of Congress made time for a private movie screening. The feature was FrackNation, a 77-minute search for the truth about the natural gas industry. The director and star, Phelim McAleer, was on hand to accept accolades, take questions, and offer free DVDs to possible apostles. Among them: Texas Rep. Lamar Smith, the new chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, who's accused the media of a ""steady pattern of bias on climate change."" ""He was glad to have these points made in an easily digestible way, on screen,"" McAleer says. ""People know there's something smelly about Gasland, but people are suspicious about how it smells."" Released in 2010 and nominated for a Best Documentary Oscar, Gasland turned the obscure anti-fracking movement into a populist, celebrity-and-Occupy-endorsed cause. Director Josh Fox shamed Washington for passing the ""Halliburton loophole"" and filmed a House committee falling over itself to defend the energy industry. In 2012, when Fox tried to film a House science hearing, he was sent away in handcuffs. (He didn't have media credentials.) That had the effect that every bogus-looking arrest has on a journalist. Fox became an even bigger star. In Fox's work, the world is evenly divided into the energy industry and its victims. McAleer--who's not the only auteur schlepping a pro-fracking movie--divides the world into innocents, dupes, and con men. This inverts the usual order, as seen in Gasland, of an open-minded journalist discovering the depths of corporate greed. In FrackNation and the completely separate TruthLand, both of which will be screened at next month's Conservative Political Action Conference, we're told that the farmer and the fracker can be friends. It would be laughable, an unwinnable conservative culture war, if the anti-fracking movement hadn't stumbled. Late last year Focus Features released Promised Land, a dramatization of the fracking game scripted by the rugged-for-Hollywood trio of Dave Eggers, Matt Damon, and John Krasinski. Damon played Steve Butler, a PR fixer for a natural gas company ordered to make a small town's plaid-clothed people lease their land and the sweet, sweet shale underneath it. The movie was ridiculous, and it tanked, as any story with a heroic Bruce Springsteen karaoke performance by the rubbery guy from The Office is bound to do. And there was collateral damage. Conservatives, then the mainstream media, asked why the movie was funded in part by Image Nation Abu Dhabi. Promised Land backfired on the movement and bolstered the pro-frackers' most populist argument. In FrackNation, McAleer travels to Poland to report on the sad lives of people who rely on Russia for their energy. Vladimir Putin, we learn, is a big fan of anti-fracking scare stories. As we hear him talk about the environmental damage done by American wells, McAleer displays aerial footage of green heartland farmscapes. ""Russia is screwed by fracking,"" a British journalist tells McAleer. Real America, as seen through his cameras, is ready to lease that land but is halted by unthinking Greens. Seriously, it is. McAleer opens the movie with a clip from a public Q&A session--him versus Josh Fox. ""Isn't it true,"" McAleer asks, ""there's reports, decades before fracking started, that there was methane in the water there?"" ""Can you identify yourself?"" Fox asks. ""Where do you come from?"" All of a sudden, the affable activist in the Ira Glass glasses looks like he's hiding something. He is. McAleer tries, and succeeds, to demolish a defining image of Gasland--a man lighting his tap water on fire. (The scene is copied in Promised Land in an elementary school.) The implication is that fracking released chemicals that introduced methane into the water table. ""But Washington and Thomas Paine lit the water of the Millstone River in New Jersey,"" McAleer says. This is true. McAleer visits Dimock, Pa., the town where water caught fire, and finds people eager to defend their reputation. One resident shows him the well they use to water plants. ""The methane don't hurt ya, but the iron turns everything red."" Another says he's ""tired of getting on the Internet and reading blogs where people are just lying."" This reality--the fact that some people really could use those drilling leases--denied Promised Land any real China Syndrome punch. (Spoiler: In the movie, the green activist trying to shut down the drilling turns out to be a fraud.) ""If it wasn't for the natural gas,"" one farmer tells McAleer, ""we wouldn't still be farming."" Another farmer, choking back tears, says his farm is ""very dear to my heart"" and ""I have a feeling the gas company can keep it without destroying it."" It's all so ridiculously keen for the natural gas industry that you understand why McAleer funded it on Kickstarter. He and wife/co-producer Ann McElhinney swore to refuse funds from the energy industry. They'd simply FOIA documents and videos and (in the tensest scene) confront one of the Dimock complainants who tells McAleer that he's ""anti-American"" and she has a gun permit. If they hadn't used Kickstarter, they might have ended up with something like TruthLand. It's brought to you by the Independent Petroleum Association of America. It's also atrocious. A camera crew follows ""Shelly, just a Pennsylvania mom,"" as she drives across the country interviewing experts. Every single expert leaves her convinced. Every one reminds her of why she despises Josh Fox. He's ""a New York filmmaker with some very misleading so-called facts."" He's ""lives in New York City and makes movies for a living."" When a New York man lights his methane-rich water on fire, she shakes her head and mutters: ""Jooooosh Fox!"" That's no way to convert fracking's many skeptics. McAleer's movie wouldn't soften their hearts, either, because they don't consider the water-on-fire scene to be the crux of the campaign. ""I've actually seen what fracking looks like on the ground,"" says the environmental activist Bill McKibben. ""The argument that they're not doing anything new is ... uncompelling. But in any case, my work on this issue has mostly been to do with its climate implications."" McAleer's movie isn't about that. It's about punching a hole through the negatives of Gasland. McKibben actually makes an appearance in the movie, accidentally, when McAleer tries to confront Fox in Los Angeles. (McKibben and Fox are making a joint appearance. McKibben answered a few questions for this article; Fox didn't.) McAleer identifies himself, follows Fox around, and then--three months after Fox himself was ejected from the Senate--is ordered off the premises. One of McAleer's crew has her iPhone snatched away and cuts her hand trying to get it back. No real damage in the long run. The DVDs are circulating through Congress. Next month, after he heads to CPAC, McAleer will be talking about fracking at a conference put on by the International Monetary Fund."	Can a Movie Make People Love Fracking Again?	[]	[]
2	2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/02/ken_stern_s_with_charity_for_all_the_internal_revenue_service_does_a_poor.html	"In the 2009 movie Whip It, Ellen Page plays Bliss Cavendar, a 17-year-old from Bodeen, Texas. Bliss is a social misfit yearning to break out of the constraints of small-town culture. After spotting a flier on a trip to Austin, she finds refuge in the speed, violence, and vaguely illicit appeal of Roller Derby. Skating under the name of ""Babe Ruthless,"" she becomes a star, a vision of youth and purity amid the tattoos and beer-soaked sexuality of the sport. But her passion for skating quickly collides with her mother's view of feminine propriety. Mom is horrified to discover her daughter's love of Roller Derby and tries to bar her from the championship match. What Bliss needed was a better strategy. She should have argued that her Roller Derby competitions were a socially sanctioned charitable activity, akin to the Red Cross or--better yet--the Junior League. Meet the Renegade Roller Girls of Bend, Ore. Like their fictitious Texas cousins, they promise violence and scantily clad action in the ""hottest show in town, with our no holds barred play,"" and they display the same affection for in-rink violence. But unlike the league in the movie, they do not operate in the shadows of abandoned warehouses; instead, they are registered as a 501(c)3 organization, approved as a public charity by the Internal Revenue Service. The Renegade Rollers are hardly alone. In 2008, the same year that the roller-skating outfit received its charitable status, the IRS approved, along with 50,000 other new charities, the applications of the All Colorado Beer Festival and the Grand Canyon Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. In fact, the IRS routinely approves more than 99.8 percent of the applications it receives for public charity status, often in very short order. In truth, starting a charity takes little more than a stamp, $400 for the filing fee, and a passing facility for filling out government forms. There are more than 1.1 million charities in the United States, and it is perhaps not surprising that some cases slip through the crack. But the story of the Renegade Roller Girls reveals something more basic about our system for identifying what is or is not a charity. Roughly put, we don't have one. The failure of the IRS and other regulators to act as gatekeepers has consequences that go beyond a few amusing anecdotes. There are substantial economic costs in the form of lost income tax and property tax revenue from organizations that hardly qualify as charities (as well as the deductions taken by their donors). It also means that more and more charities are competing for a finite amount of money from public and private donors, diminishing the effectiveness of real charities. And when people become aware of this problem, it's understandable that they come away feeling that many charities are downright uncharitable. Charitable hospitals are perhaps the best example. They are a linchpin in the American medical system, accounting for about two-thirds of all Medicare beds in this country. And while they are only about 1 percent of the country's charities, charitable hospitals collect 43 percent of all charitable revenue, about $650 billion a year. The phrase charity hospital may still conjure up images of scruffy floors, Jell-O-laden dinner trays, and volunteer nuns, but that isn't the reality anymore. Charitable hospitals can be extraordinarily luxurious. Witness the Greenberg Pavilion at the New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, which advertises its hotel-like amenities such as Frette bed linens and original works of art. (A hospital room there can run $2,400 a night.) And they can be extraordinarily profitable, too. Leaders of charitable hospitals routinely are paid into the seven figures, even more on some occasions. In fact, charitable hospitals are far more likely to make money: 77 percent of charitable hospitals are profitable compared to 61 percent of for-profit institutions. Some are immensely profitable, such as Boston Children's Hospital, which was recently cited in a government report for its high charges despite sitting on $2.6 billion in investment assets. The purpose here is not to demonize charitable hospitals; they are the product of a changing business, regulatory, and health care system. Charitable hospitals are not worse than for-profit hospitals; they are, in fact, fundamentally the same. In 2006, the Congressional Budget Office compared for-profit and charitable hospitals across various critical service criteria and found only the smallest differences between them. The CBO study found the charitable hospitals to be slightly more likely to provide uncompensated and specialized services; on the other hand, for-profit hospitals were modestly more likely to provide Medicare or Medicaid services and to serve economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. It is hard to come away from the CBO study with the view that there are any significant business differences between the two, which makes the lucrative charitable tax exemption that charitable hospitals receive all the more puzzling. Illinois, for one, has tried to strip several of its charitable hospitals of their tax exemptions for just this reason. It's hard to understand why some organizations receive charitable status and others do not. One of our core, and fairly obvious, organizing principles is that a charity must dispense a public service rather than a private good. But many of our most prominent civic charities would struggle to meet that basic test. Tickets to symphonies, operas, and the like are often so prohibitively expensive that their primary services effectively exclude everyone but the well-off. Private schools are perhaps an even better example, not only because they charge enormous tuition fees but also because they are of questionable social value. Average costs at prep schools exceed $10,000 a year--a figure that has skyrocketed in recent years--and can reach more than $40,000 in some cases. Not surprisingly given these costs, private school students tend to be wealthy, white, and from much better educated families than their public school peers. Nevertheless, we grant these institutions of privilege charitable and tax-exempt status, even though they unquestionably lead to greater social and economic stratification through the hollowing out of the public school system. Private schools are of course largely supported by their tuition fees, but the benefits they receive from their charitable status are substantial. Indeed, sometimes it is that very status that leads the superwealthy to make incredible gifts to some very fortunate schools. Take, for example, the $49 million Ethel Allen left the Hackley School in Tarrytown, N.Y., last year, or the $50 million gift by casino magnate Sheldon Adelson to support the Adelson Educational Campus in Las Vegas. It may seem that changing the charitable status for private schools is unthinkable. Perhaps, but it has been tried before. In 2009, the British Charity Commission revoked the charitable charters for two private schools, finding that they provided too little in the way of financial aid to needy students. While the commission's ruling was ultimately overturned by the courts, the commission's position still stands for the common sense notion that charities should demonstrate a public benefit in order to maintain their charitable status. When so much of the American charitable sector seems so uncharitable, it is perhaps time we remind ourselves what a charity is really supposed to be."

The day after the vote, the New York Times, Politico, and the Washington Post ran versions of the same Cruz profile. By accusing Chuck Hagel of lying on his disclosure forms and building consensus for a one-week delay--just a few more documents, please--Cruz had made enemies out of everyone on the conservative blacklist. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said Cruz had acted ""out of bounds."" Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, viewed by the right as an accidental senator who rigged the Republican primary to make sure she'd face Todd Akin, compared Cruz to Joe McCarthy. That was exactly what Cruz wanted. All of it. Portraying his opponents as traitors-in-training has been Cruz's shtick since he started running for Senate three years ago. On Friday, Jane Mayer dug into her 2010 notebooks and found Cruz telling an Americans for Prosperity crowd that Harvard Law School, in the early 1990s, employed 12 professors ""who would say they were Marxists who believed in the Communists overthrowing the United States government."" Cruz's old professors, reached by Mayer, had no earthly idea what he was talking about. The Huffington Post borg repackaged this story with the headline ""TED MCCARTHY,"" and the resultant comment thread outpaced the one beneath ""LOOK: What Women Really Look Like Naked."" Cruz pulled this off with less than two months of experience in elected office. Before winning the Senate seat in Texas, he'd worked on the legal team for George W. Bush's presidential campaign, and there his political resume ended. Cruz's reputation, and his campaign pitch, grew out of his years as Texas's solicitor general. Cruz argued nine cases in front of the Supreme Court, starting with Frew v. Hawkins, when he was just 34 years old. In transcripts from those cases, Cruz sounds just like the senator who's making life agony for Chuck Hagel. The difference is that he's usually losing. There are no doddering ex-senators waiting patiently for their turns to talk, or journalists raring to write another ""Great Republican Hope?"" piece. In their place: justices who want to shred his argument. Frew v. Hawkins, for example, was a disaster for Cruz. The state had given him a weak case: It was arguing that federal requirements for improving health care didn't apply to Texas, because of state sovereignty guaranteed by the 11th Amendment. Cruz's own arguments foreshadowed some of the theories that would become conservative gospel in the Obama years. In 2004, they were met with a wall of laughter. ""I will point out if signing a consent decree is a waiver of 11th Amendment immunity or sovereign immunity, then plaintiffs' argument proves too much,"" said Cruz. ""It means every consent decree is utterly immune from Ex Parte Young. It means once a consent decree is there, the requirements of Federal law don't matter."" ""Only with the state attorney general,"" joked Antonin Scalia. Texas lost 9-0. His first notable, partial win came with Latin American Citizens v. Perry, the suit brought against the state for a mid-decade gerrymander. By a 5-4 margin, the court's liberals upheld the mid-decade gerrymander, but struck down a district along the Rio Grande--the 23rd district--that had apparently been drawn to minimize the Latino vote. Anthony Kennedy, siding with the liberals, wrote the decision. He also gave Cruz hell about the map. ""Do you want this court to say that it's constitutionally permissible to take away a number of minority voters from the district, but leave just enough so that it looks like a minority?"" Kennedy asked. ""Is that a permissible use of race? It seems to me that's an affront and an insult."" ""Except the district court found as a factual matter that what happened in district 23 was wholly political,"" said Cruz. ""It was not racial, so that the voters were not removed because of race. They were removed because of politics."" ""But the additional finding is that 50 percent were kept to make it look good,"" said Kennedy. ""As this court has said, the legislature will always be aware of the racial composition of a district."" In 2013, away from the bench, Cruz doesn't have to be so cagey about race and politics. ""Democrats and the media are afraid of Marco Rubio because he is a smart, intelligent, conservative Hispanic,"" he told reporters in Texas this week. At other times, he's accused President Obama of wanting immigration to fail, so Democrats can hold onto the issue and call Republicans racist. During his campaign, Cruz didn't talk much about Latin American Citizens v. Perry. His biggest victory, the one he featured in campaign ads, was Medellin v. Texas. It was a simple story: A Mexican murderer had tried to use the Geneva Convention to wriggle out of a death sentence. In Avena and Other Mexican Nationals, the International Court of Justice had ruled for Medellin. In 2008, a 6-3 majority of justices sided with Cruz and against Medellin. But that took some doing. The case first arrived at the court in 2005, as Medellin v. Dretke, a suit brought against the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Cruz argued that neither the ICJ judgment, nor a memorandum from George W. Bush, overruled the state's law. ""The president of the United States has issued a document where he says, 'Exercising my foreign-affairs power, in my opinion the treaty. ...  I accept the meaning of the treaty as set forth by the ICJ and apply it to these 51 cases,"" said Stephen Breyer. ""So he's deciding that. And why doesn't he have the authority to decide what that treaty means in these circumstances? That's his decision. And Texas is bound by the Constitution."" ""We would agree that the fact that the president has acted underscores the point made by both Texas and the United States,"" said Cruz, ""that the responsibility for determining the remedy to the Avena judgment is found in the political branches."" But that proved his point. There was no precedent for using the ICJ as a basis for an American decision. ""Respectfully,"" said Cruz, ""if we were to lose, and if Medellin were to prevail, his position could potentially open the door to the reconsideration of the over 100 foreign nationals that are on death row across this country, and, beyond that, to thousands."" ""Well, so could the president's order,"" said Justice John Paul Stevens. ""The same thing."" By a 5-4 decision, the court punted and let Medellin continue his appeals. Not long after that, William Rehnquist passed away, and was replaced by John Roberts. In 2008, a stronger case won out with a new court. That victory made Cruz a national conservative star. In a roundabout way, it was cited in his major SCOTUS disaster. Cruz represented five states in Kennedy v. Louisiana, arguing for the constitutionality of a law that allowed the death penalty for child rape. He lost 5-4. The transcript of that loss portrays a snarkier Cruz. ""Blackstone actually talks about how rape under Saxon law was punishable by death,"" he said, laying out the moral standard--not international laws!--buttressing his case. ""There was a period in 1285 where the punishment was relaxed to loss of the eyes and testicles. That was William the Conqueror's kinder, gentler version."" He wasn't as fond of the modern Brits. The ""Law Lords,"" members of the House of Lords, had submitted a brief against the Louisiana law. ""That brief, to my mind, embodied all of the dangers of the very broad arguments that we're being presented in Medellin, that ultimately the Constitution and the people of this country determine what is permissible and what is lawful,"" said Cruz. ""This court has chosen to look to other nations for guidance, but that brief didn't say this is guidance. That brief said the United States is foreclosed from ever doing this because other nations have made determinations under their law."" The court didn't make much of that point, but it ruled against the state anyway. The defeat was the only somewhat useful negative attack that Cruz's 2012 primary opponent could come up with. But once he entered politics, Cruz's fireworks and dazzle simply worked. If you fail to impress a judge or court, you lose the case. No real upside. If you try the same tactics in the Senate, you might constantly end up on the losing side of votes. But you gain a following. You win with the media. There's a lesson here, and Cruz has learned it with quicksilver speed."	Why Should Anyone Take Sen. Ted Cruz Seriously?

4	4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/02/barack_obama_s_presidential_legacy_the_president_must_keep_the_pressure.html	"President Obama made two phone calls to Republicans in Congress this week. One was phony and one was real. The difference between the two calls underscores the challenge for his second term: How do you work with Republicans while you are simultaneously making yourself more loathsome to them? The preliminary answer seems to be by modulating your aggression. The president is betting part of his presidency on picking budget fights with Republicans, while resting most of his legacy on avoiding confrontation when it comes to passing immigration reform. Will it work? Getting this balance right will determine whether the president's second term will be a success or a smoldering coda. It might also tell us something about leadership in a time of political sclerosis. Let's start with the phony call. On Thursday, President Obama called House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. The subject was the sequester, the across-the-board spending cuts set to kick in March 1. Administration aides privately concede that the calls were largely for show. The president wanted it to appear as though he was making an effort to avoid the cuts. If the cuts happen and the public looks to blame someone, the president can say he tried to reach out. This strategy achieved a rare level of bipartisan agreement in Washington. According to GOP aides, their bosses received the calls in the spirit in which they were dialed--as empty public relations moves that did nothing to avert the cuts. The president and his aides think they have the upper hand politically. They point to the numbers. In a recent PEW poll, even a majority of Republicans support the president's call for a mix of spending reductions and tax increases. In the Bloomberg poll, the president's approval rating (55 percent) was 20 points higher than that of the Republican Party (35 percent). With the public on his side, the president will continue to use his office to highlight that Republicans are opposing a popular way forward. And why not, it's worked twice already. The president's new, less compromising approach led to agreement with Republicans  over the fiscal cliff and the debt limit. Congressional Republicans have a number of reasons to resist the pressure. The latest, explained to me last night by one GOP aide, is that their poll numbers won't get any better with an agreement. The public won't suddenly start loving Republicans because they agreed to a deal to fund the government, a task most people think is part of their job anyway. The president learned this lesson last summer after he cemented an agreement with Republicans to keep the government open. No one gives you credit for deciding not to slam your hand in the door. The clash is driven by principle: Republicans think Washington has a spending problem and any solution based on higher taxes is misplaced. They can elide this point to scrape together a short-term agreement, as they did during the debt limit struggle, but the fundamental philosophical disagreement remains. So, many Republicans believe they might as well have the fight now. Plus, the base would lose it if Republicans caved to the president. Conservatives already think congressional Republicans were defeated on the fights over the fiscal cliff and the debt limit. This would be a third surrender. Is the president's hard line a failure of leadership? Republicans say yes. John Boehner's aides have been sending reporters copies of stories chronicling president Obama's lack of congressional outreach. If outreach is a sign of leadership and the president isn't doing that, then it follows that he's the one to blame for this sequester mess. Of course, the White House says it doesn't have a willing partner, so they think the old model of ""reasoning together"" is less effective than simply making Republicans cry uncle. But they understand the importance of appearances. That is what inspired the president's speed dialing. The president has to look like he's trying so he can't be tagged for not leading. But is there any merit to the charge? Is the president failing to lead? That depends on your definition. George Bush defined leadership as taking tough stances and holding to them no matter what. In an interview, he actually said the howls of protest from the opposition defined just how much he was leading. President Obama is taking a hard-line stance based on his philosophical view about how you grow government. He's not wavering. It's the same attitude Republicans have toward taxes. The president is not always turning up the pressure. This gets us to the second phone call. Last weekend a draft of the president's immigration legislation had leaked. Republicans were immediately suspicious. The president had publicly said he wanted Congress to take up this task, but the leaked document suggested he was either hatching his own plan to circumvent negotiations or trying to influence the existing plan by leaking to the press. No one can blame Republicans for reacting this way, particularly in these partisan times. The president is busy raising the pressure on Republicans in the sequester fight; why wouldn't he do the same on immigration? That is the difficulty of negotiating with a party on one issue while you're battering them on another. So, the president called Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio, and John McCain to talk to them about immigration. According to White House aides, the call was not primarily about exchanging substantive ideas. But unlike the calls on the sequester, the lack of substance didn't mean the call was pure theater. The president was calling to explain to the suspicious Republicans that he wasn't trying to sabotage the bipartisan efforts to reform immigration. Republicans have asked Obama not to meddle on immigration. He's supposed to stay out of the way and be a follower. The reason is that the more he is associated with the legislation, the less likely Republicans will vote for it. On the sequester, Republicans define presidential leadership as reaching out to Congress. But when it comes to immigration reform, they are asking the president to show leadership by keeping his distance. So far the president has taken his cue and has eased off on the pressure. Every indication for the moment is that he wants an immigration deal and he knows that, unlike with the budget, aggression is less helpful than compromise. Why is there a difference? The election inspired some Republicans to loosen their position on immigration reform. It did not shake their feelings about the desirability of tax increases. When the president spoke about immigration reform in Las Vegas in late January, he was specific about the details he wanted to see in any final legislation. That rankled Republicans in Congress who thought he was meddling in the legislation they were carefully trying to craft. A little more than a week later, when the president talked about the issue in his State of the Union address, he was less specific. Republicans trying to cobble together a deal were grateful. They saw it as a dialing down of presidential pressure. That was their view, at least, until the leak last weekend. In the end, the leaked White House draft may help close an immigration deal. Sen. Rubio attacked it the minute the details hit the Internet. Some conservatives are suspicious of Rubio's efforts to reach a compromise with Democrats. Bashing the president's plan let the freshman from Florida show he's still fighting for conservative principles, which in this case means stricter enforcement against new illegal immigrants before granting amnesty for existing lawbreakers. White House aides say that wasn't the plan--they wanted to keep the details of the president's plan secret--but they're happy to let the leak play that role. With the president so regularly antagonizing the GOP, White House aides recognize that any deal with Republicans might require giving those same Republicans some opportunities to show how much they disagree with the man they're eventually going to agree with."

Half of the cuts will hit defense; half will hit Medicare spending. We've been expecting this since the summer of 2011. We were supposed to deal with it in December--remember the words fiscal cliff?--but most of Congress punted the cuts to March 1. It's the latest in the ongoing series of manufactured crises that have made Congress our most beloved institution. What's more fun than a manufactured crisis? Why, a manufactured political spat about that crisis! Seven weeks have passed since the deadline was bumped to March, and in that time the Republican Party has alternated between attacking the White House for pushing sequestration and infighting over whether the cuts should proceed as they are. It's confusing. I can explain. How did this become Obama's fault? It started with Mitt Romney, a once-influential Republican Party politician and its 2012 nominee for president. In the third debate with President Obama, Romney fretted that ""a trillion dollars in cuts through sequestration and budget cuts to the military"" would weaken America's defenses. The president literally dismissed this with a wave of his hand. ""The sequester is not something that I proposed,"" he said. ""It's something that Congress has proposed. It will not happen."" Up to that point, Romney had talked vaguely about how ""presidential leadership"" could undo sequestration. Republican candidates in states with lots of jobs tied to defense spending muddled the origins of the deal, the better to blame Democrats for ""devastating job losses."" Voters refused to blame Democrats for the cuts. Why would they? Sequestration was part of a debt deal signed in order to get Republicans to raise the debt limit. But here, on national TV, the president was putting the blame for sequestration (we can probably blame him for popularizing the bowdlerization, sequester) on ""Congress."" Republicans knew that wasn't true. It wasn't? Not really. The accidental Bible of Sequestration is The Price of Politics, Bob Woodward's history of the debt-limit wars, and one of the least flattering portrayals of the president this side of Breitbart.com. In it, Woodward recounts a July 27, 2011, afternoon meeting between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and White House negotiators. Reid wanted a ""trigger"" as part of a debt deal, some way to force more cuts in the future without defaulting on the debt that summer. Chief of Staff Jack Lew and adviser Rob Nabors proposed sequestration, as a threat that could be averted if/when Congress passed a better deal. But didn't John Boehner take credit for sequestration? Yeah, but he didn't take credit for the concept. On July 31, 2011, Boehner made a PowerPoint presentation to House Republicans that mentioned all the nice triggers they'd get if they backed the deal. Boehner, at the time, was trying to convince a lot of members who had sworn never to raise the debt limit that they could knuckle under and get cuts later. ""Sequestration process,"" read one slide, ""is designed to guarantee that Congress acts on the Joint Committee's legislation to cut spending."" What's the difference between his position and Obama's position? Almost nothing, really, except for the blink-and-you'll-miss-it reference to ""cutting spending."" Boehner's job was to convince Republicans that the deal would not lead to tax hikes down the road. He succeeded. And when the ""Supercommittee"" collapsed, there was no grand bargain to cut spending while hiking taxes. Then who cares whether Obama or Congress came up with the idea? Republicans care! They've spent the past few weeks blaming Obama for sequestration, bringing the media along with a good old-fashioned hypocrisy hook. Since January, Republican leaders have taken care to rename sequestration ""the president's sequester."" On Feb. 8, Republican leaders unveiled the hashtag #Obamaquester, to be used whenever tweeting a story about 1) failure of presidential leadership, 2) some sad job cuts being threatened at home, or 3) a breaking-news video of a Democrat saying that Obama agreed to sequestration. ""He drove this thing in August of 2011,"" said Sen. John Thune on Fox News this month, referring to the president. ""He wanted the sequester--you read Woodward's book and page 326 or somewhere in there--and these deep cuts in defense, thinking at the time that that would put enough pressure on Republicans to get them to agree to higher taxes."" Right, and Republicans have ""twice passed legislation"" to replace the sequestration cuts. Who told you that? It's a common Republican talking point, but it's misleading in two ways. The House passed two bills related to sequestration replacement, but the first one, in May 2012, didn't offer specific cuts. It moved the total amount of defense cuts over into the non-defense budget, like a croupier moving chips into the winner's pile. The actual replacement cuts were only spelled out in the Spending Reduction Act of 2012, passed by a razor-thin, Republicans-only vote on Dec. 20, 2012. The Congress that passed it expired on Jan. 3 of this year, so the bill is dead. Couldn't Republicans introduce that bill again? They could, but they won't. Republicans prefer the talking point to another tough vote on spending cuts, and when you ask whether they'll move the bill, they wash their hands of the whole mess. ""We've done our work,"" Boehner spokesman Michael Steel told me via email today. ""Waiting on the Senate."" Well, fine, what's the Senate doing? The Senate Democrats actually announced a sequestration replacement plan last week, right before this 11-day recess began. When Boehner refers to a ""plan that can pass both Houses of Congress,"" he is implying that this one can't. The Republican plan couldn't, either, but you know how it is. What's the difference between the House Republican plan and the Senate Democrats' plan? You can't name just one. The Senate plan would replace the $85 billion of cuts this year with $110 billion of cuts and taxes, reducing the defense cuts to $27.5 billion and raising (hopefully) $54 billion with the ""Buffet rule,"" the new millionaire income tax. The House Republican plan from last year replaced all the defense cuts--over the 10-year sequestration period, not just this year--by undoing much of the Obama presidency. The ""Orderly Liquidation Authority"" in Dodd-Frank, the $22 billion dedicated to breaking down banks? Gone. The Social Services Block Grant? Gone for $17 billion. The $14.5 billion for state health care exchanges and the $16 billion Prevention and Public Health Fund created by Obamacare? Gone. Any better ideas? I wouldn't say ""better,"" but there are two factions in the GOP that oppose their party's ""official"" plan. The first, larger faction: Spending hawks who are willing to let the axe come down on defense. ""They all voted to raise the debt ceiling with a military sequester,"" Sen. Rand Paul told me last year, ""and now they're all basically caterwauling about it."" In his Tea Party response to the State of the Union, he opposed any wimpy replacement of sequestration. Hawks like him are unconvinced by the warnings of huge job losses. ""I think that's the kind of demagoguery that we see when people aren't interested in true spending reductions,"" said Georgia Rep. Tom Price, who has a decent chance of being elected to the Senate next year. ""They always put the worst thing out there that affects people's guts."" The other Republican faction consists of defense hawks, like Sen. Lindsey Graham and Sen. John McCain, who want to replace this year's defense cuts with cuts to the federal workforce. They might be the most dangerous, friendly-firing Republicans of all, in pure ""messaging"" terms. I give up. Why? Because Graham, McCain, and other defense hawks challenge the conventional (and wrong) wisdom that sequestration would sign up Washington for horrible cuts it could never undo. Earlier this month, one Republican member tried to convince me that the damage from sequestration wouldn't be as bad as people say, because the next fight in Washington will be over the continuing resolution that funds the government. Congress can whittle down the ""meat axe"" and change what gets cut. ""On March 28,"" said the Republican, ""you can re-order the priorities of how these reductions take place. Give the heads of these departments the flexibility they need to make smart savings."" If that happens, then the eternal battle over spending cuts and tax hikes continues, moving past an event Republicans can blame on the president. The public is pretty well acclimated to blaming Republicans for a government shutdown, in part because there are lots of Republican members on record not worrying about a shutdown. The White House knows that. Democrats know that the ""Buffett rule"" is incredibly popular. And they know it's the Republicans, not them, who are grasping for leverage. It was one short month ago that House Republicans met in Williamsburg and agreed to punt the debt limit a few months, because they'd rather fight on the sequester, and look more responsible. ""Why wouldn't we deal with the smaller [challenges] first,"" said South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney at that retreat. ""Maybe build up a little momentum, a little credibility, not only with the credit markets, but with the folks back home, that we can deal with these things."" It made more sense than blaming the next wave of the debt crisis on Barack Obama."	Who Is Lying to You About Sequestration?	['Mulvaney', 'Romney', 'Reid', 'Paul', 'Obama', 'Thune']	[]
6	6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/02/the_white_house_press_corps_accomplishes_very_little_whether_they_have_access.html	"The pool report reads like a dispatch from the war-torn deserts of northern Mali. At 1:45 p.m., the reporter assigned to cover the president on Saturday ""got confirmation"" on where the president was. ""Still officially under a lid,"" wrote the reporter, ""we decided to assemble and at 2:10 PM we logged a request to the White House for access."" The wrangling went on for hours, until ""our handlers finally arrived at 4:17 PM and our bus was on the move."" In the last update, reporters learned that the pool was ""holding outside the compound."" The request, of course, was for the president to open up his golf game with Tiger Woods and maybe take some questions. The White House's failure to do so inspired a letter from Fox News' Ed Henry, president of the White House Correspondents Association. ""All we're asking for is a brief exception, quick access, a quick photo-op on the 18th green,"" Henry told Politico's Dylan Byers. ""It's not about golf--it's about transparency and access in a broader sense."" This sounds incredibly stupid, but sometimes it's the stupid things that count. Henry et al. have kicked off a kind of debate about the Obama administration's atrocious record of letting the press corps talk to the president. The debate has raged from the pages of Politico to ... well, to the pages of Politico. But the magazine/website/cult is right on this one. George W. Bush took questions after 355 events; Obama has taken questions after only 107 events. The president's held 35 press conferences, but only a few in primetime. Obama's contempt for the press corps runs long and deep. In the 2008 campaign, he could go weeks without an ""avail."" In March 2008, at a low point before the Ohio and Texas primaries, Obama tried to end a press conference and looked shocked that the press kept shouting at him. ""C'mon, guys,"" he said. ""I just answered, like, eight questions!"" In office, Obama has given 60 Minutes's Steve Kroft the privilege of regular, Tuesdays With Morrie-esque interviews, with questions like, ""What do you think the biggest success has been, foreign policy success, of the first term?"" Surely, the White House press corps can do better than this. ""Why bother with The New York Times beat reporter when Obama can go on 'The View'?"" wrote Jim VandeHei and Mike Allen in Politico. ""The president has not granted an interview to print reporters at The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, Politico, and others in years. These are the reporters who are often most likely to ask tough, unpredictable questions."" If that's true, why isn't the daily coverage coming out of the White House more interesting? Why doesn't anything resembling news come out of the daily Q&As? The White House (transparently!) publishes all the questions and on-the-record answers that come in the daily briefings or gaggles. Since the State of the Union, the sluggers on the White House beat haven't moved the story at all. The big questions, the non-logistical questions (i.e., not ""why is he going to this factory?""), fit into three categories: How will you pass this? The first questions after the State of the Union to Jay Carney and economic adviser Jason Furman were about tactics. ""What is your strategy this time for sort of getting Congress' approval on this strategy?"" asked one reporter. That teed up Carney for some talking points: ""If this president or any leader approached these challenges with an attitude of, well, this is going to be hard so I won't try, we wouldn't get anything done in Washington."" About the only new idea in the president's speech was a minimum wage hike. That proposal led one reporter to tell deputy press secretary Joshua Earnest, ""We've heard some remarks from Speaker Boehner expressing reluctance to pass this,"" followed by this question: ""What's the administration's strategy?"" Earnest dodged. ""The last two times that we have raised the minimum wage, Republicans were instrumental in the effort to get it raised,"" he said, pointlessly. How do you respond to this? Shooting over a question that originated elsewhere is a clean way of sounding objective. ""Has the White House ever said why it thinks Senate Republicans are linking Hagel's confirmation to the events in Benghazi?"" asked one reporter on the flight to Chicago on Friday. ""I mean, why are they so insistent on linking the two?"" After the State of the Union, a smorgasbord of economic claims with little data, a reporter tried to dig in by citing a think tank report. ""I read this morning an analysis, I think from Brookings, that the statements last night were a rejection of the idea of a territorial tax system."" Carney, sarcastically, thanked the reporter ""for in the morning reading think-tank analysis before everyone else."" Remember when you said this? After the State of the Union, Carney and Furman were reminded that ""the president in 2008 proposed raising the minimum wage to $9.50,"" a full 50 cents higher than his current plan. ""So are Americans able to get by on less now than they would be four years ago?"" This and the question about legislative strategy were the only queries about the minimum wage all week. That was why Ed Henry's complaints were not endorsed by an angry mob of readers. What exactly are they getting from the White House press corps, when it has access and when it doesn't? The only media able to cancel out the president's impressive filibustering skills are Reddit AMAs and Google Hangouts. The White House reporters are able to broadcast or dateline from exotic locations--the beat, writes Michael Hastings in his e-book about 2012, is ""a serious, $10,000-a-day habit of following presidents around the country and the world."" I've heard more than a few reporters complain about the drop-off in real, interesting stories when they're ""promoted"" from the congressional beat to the White House. Instead of collaring committee chairmen and breaking news, they're getting anonymous background reads on stories that aren't even interesting, and they're maybe getting to ask Jay Carney about a story bubbling up on the Drudge Report. These poor souls got their tribute in the fourth episode of House of Cards, where the odious/ambitious young reporter, Zoe Barnes, is offered the White House beat and turns it down. ""The White House is where news goes to die,"" she says. ""Everything is canned--all those prepared statements."" A colleague insists that the beat is prestigious. ""It used to be. When I was in ninth grade. Now it's a graveyard."" An irrelevant White House press corps is what any White House wants. That doesn't mean it's good for the president. Had President Obama gotten a few questions about the timeline of the Benghazi attacks--had Steve Kroft bared some of the teeth he showed when he reported a story on Congress--it wouldn't be so easy for Republicans to say their questions were never answered. Does the president want to field some policy questions? Then, he should field some policy questions. But the increasingly vestigial-looking White House press corps isn't really suited for that. When ""Zoe Barnes"" said the beat was where ""news goes to die,"" she was quoting Ana Marie Cox, who said that nearly four years ago. Cox suggested, daringly, that the corps should be replaced with an ever-changing amoeba of beat reporters. ""When the president speaks out on AIG, let financial and labor reporters truth-squad him,"" she wrote. ""When North Korea launches a missile, let defense and Asia specialists assess the White House reaction."" If America really needs to know what's up at the president's golf game, why send a human to lurk and lip-read? Send an unmanned drone with a mic and camera. It would be ironic, it would cost less, and wouldn't waste so many people's time."	Who Needs the White House Press Corps?	['Carney', 'Allen', 'Obama', 'Hastings']	[]
7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/02/ken_cuccinelli_s_is_ultraconservative_and_likely_to_be_virginia_s_next_governor.html	"Serious question: When was the last time a politician wrote a policy manifesto right before a campaign, and it didn't do irreparable damage to his internal organs? Sen. Rick Santorum published It Takes A Family right before his 2006 re-election bid, and Democrats plumbed his pre-Vatican II views to destroy him. Gov. Rick Perry published Fed Up!, then ran for president and looked dazzled when Republican voters rejected his ""Ponzi scheme"" take on Social Security. (To be fair, Perry always looked dazzled.) On Jan. 30, two weeks before The Last Line of Defense hit shelves and Kindle apps, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli's own book was leaked to the Washington Post. In it, Cuccinelli would ""echo Romney's 47 percent"" remarks, writing that Medicare, Social Security, and ""outright welfare"" all ""make people dependent on government,"" sapping the country's verve. ""Romney's words, captured on a hidden camera, helped sink his campaign,"" pointed out the paper, helpfully. ""Time will tell how the similar language plays for Cuccinelli."" The Washington Post keeps waiting for the time when Cuccinelli will be sunk. It never comes. ""He doubts the science of global warming,"" wrote the paper in a 2009 editorial, endorsing his opponent in the attorney general race. ""He peddles outmoded, half-baked and prejudicial theories about homosexuals."" He won by 15 points. He spooked any possible Republican rival out of this year's gubernatorial race--they remembered 2009, when Gadsen-flag-waving Cuccinelli fans took over the state party convention--and in the most recent poll, he's winning. Cuccinelli's secret is simple: He runs when things are good for Republicans. Virginia holds state elections in odd-numbered years, so their A-team--Gov. Bob McDonnell, Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, Cuccinelli--haven't ever fought the tide of Obama turnout. In 2009, Virginia's electorate was 78 percent white and 40 percent ""conservative""; in 2012, those numbers fell to 70 percent and 31 percent. His Democratic foe this year will be Terry McAuliffe, who has all the populist appeal of a long-lost Romney brother. The biggest threat to a Cuccinelli governorship comes from Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, who keeps threatening to run as an independent, and warns that Cuccinelli's new tome will give Democrats ""ammunition"" to destroy him. If that's the case, then 2013 will be the year the Tea Party finally croaks. Cuccinelli is the Tea Party in one body, an underrated and likeable politician who sees it as his mission on earth to unwind government power. He was, he constantly reminds us, the first state attorney general to sue the federal government over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. ""After I was elected, but before I was sworn in as attorney general,"" he was on the phone with other AGs about how to do this, no matter what was in the bill. Five minutes after President Obama signed it, Cuccinelli--trailed by TV cameras--walked over to Richmond's federal courthouse to file the suit. ""It was not until later that evening,"" recalls Cuccinelli, ""after the suit was filed, the calls of the day had been made, and all the media interviews were finished--that I realized that day, March 23, 2010, was the 235th anniversary to the day of Patrick Henry's 'Give me liberty or give me death' speech ... which he gave in Richmond, Virginia ... just one mile away down the very same street from the federal courthouse."" The ellipses are his, meant to evoke the moment. ""I was just thankful to God that this time we fought with arguments in the courtrooms of America, and not with bullets on the bloody battlefields of war."" The bulk of his book recounts the history of the health care lawsuit, which the attorneys general lost--and which Cuccinelli, who sued the government independently of the main AG coalition, lost even more decisively. He tells the history that became less than relevant after the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision, the tale of the Obama administration fumbling and getting constantly outmatched. ""At several points, Justice Kagan seemed to try to 'carry' Solicitor General Verrilli through his own argument, as he tried to make useful points,"" he writes. He high-fives Justice Samuel Alito for a comparison--health care costs to burial costs--that didn't end up impressing anyone. ""In one short question, Justice Alito utterly decimated the 'logic' of the federal government's explanation of the supposed 'uniqueness' of the health care market."" Why did the good guys lose? Cuccinelli decides that the game was rigged against them. The media--he mentions columnists like Richard Cohen, excerpting their calumnies--never told the truth about the law, or the mandate to buy health insurance. ""Imagine how apoplectic the big-government statists would get if Congress voted to force everyone to buy a gun,"" he harrumphs. In his reading, conservatives absolutely won the argument, but President Obama--the head of a ""group of lawbreakers""--browbeat the court into caving. ""The possibility that Chief Justice Roberts flip-flopped to uphold [the Affordable Care Act] will encourage future bullying by presidents,"" he writes, citing CBS News's report on deliberations that didn't quite go this way. ""Why? Because it looks as if it worked."" In his telling, Cuccinelli only loses in courts--federal court, the court of public opinion--if no one pays attention to the Constitution. Why would they pay attention? They're lulled into obedience. They don't understand that ""every single thing government does to increase its own power increases the size of its slice of the liberty pie,"" and ""since there are only two slices, every time the government's slice of liberty pie grows, the citizens' slice is reduced."" The people responsible are either liars or dupes. In shorter chapters about his quest to get--then, one assumes, debunk--climate change data, Cuccinelli suggests that ""climate researchers may have given up the purity of science to forward a global warming agenda ... simply for the research money."" After all, ""when researchers in the field of climatology predicted a global warming doomsday, governments were willing to shovel lots of money in their direction to try to find ways to stop it."" They fudge data; they fail to understand that CO2 is ""the gas we all exhale from our bodies every second of every day."" Nothing in this book puts Cuccinelli apart from the median Republican governor. All this week, while he was doing book interviews, Republican governors in blue states were rejecting the federal government's offer of Medicaid funding. The government would pay 100 percent of the Medicaid expansion provided by Obamacare through 2014, and 90 percent in the first years thereafter. ""I likened this to the old Black Flag 'Roach Motel' roach traps for the states,"" writes Cuccinelli. ""Once you check in, you never check out."" Through 2022, taking the money would cost his state $2 billion. And to what end? The early, campaign-ready excerpts got Cuccinelli's philosophy right, but they didn't tell his origin story. He, too, once suffered from unexpected health care costs. His father lost insurance; his mother fell ill. But the Cuccinellis, wary of slicing the Liberty Pie, downsized their lives. ""The last thing my parents thought about doing was asking the government to force other people to pay our bills,"" he writes. ""The lesson that life isn't necessarily fair and that it's not government's job to make it fair is worth learning early in life."" The party that holds the White House typically loses the off-year elections. In 2013, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is leading by up to 40 points in the polls after--back to Cuccinelli's metaphor--carving a slice of the Freedom Pie to pay for his state's post-hurricane recovery. Then there's Virginia, where the Republican candidate considers that sort of behavior downright anti-Jeffersonian. And he's never lost an election."

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/02/barack_obama_s_state_of_the_union_address_like_ted_nugent_republican_lawmakers.html	"As reporters found their seats in the House press gallery, they shared a question: Where was Ted Nugent? The 64-year old rock star, who last cracked the charts with 1980's ""Wango Tango,"" had been invited to the State of the Union as a guest of Texas Rep. Steve Stockman. Thirty-odd Democrats had invited the families of gun violence victims to sit for the speech, but they were never famous. Not even in 1980. BuzzFeed's D.C. editor, John Stanton, asked a peer to help him find a ""tall, crazy-looking"" white guy. When President Obama entered the chamber, Nugent stood up, and reporters finally saw him. He spent the entire speech, 13 typed pages, in various stages of physical agony. At the emotional apex of the night, when the president counted off victims who ""deserve a vote,"" Nugent sat with his arms crossed. ""My favorite part was when I couldn't hear clearly,"" said Nugent to reporters after the speech. ""Then I didn't get angry."" A cynic might have looked at Nugent then, attracting swarms of reporters below statues of Bob LaFollette and Huey Long, and asked why the media went so astray. It's a good question. But Obama's speech--especially the rousing section on guns--was an appeal for skeptical members of Congress to abandon their positions and come around to his. If Nugent joined the Republican caucus, he wouldn't even be its most conservative member. Someone more conservative could--nay, will--throw up hurdles against a gun bill, or an immigration bill, or a voting reform bill. The president's message: I dare you. ""Overwhelming majorities of Americans--Americans who believe in the Seconnd Amendment--have come together around common-sense reform,"" said the president, ""like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun."" A new climate bill would be ""like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago."" Immigration would happen because ""as we speak, bipartisan groups in both chambers are working diligently to draft a bill."" This worked well on the specific people Obama cited. McCain, who spent the hours before the speech threatening to filibuster Obama nominees until he got more facts about the 2012 Benghazi killings, leapt to his feet and smiled at the immigration line. He nodded over at Sen. Lindsey Graham, his foxhole buddy from the 2005-2007 immigration wars. Sen. Chuck Schumer, their most powerful Senate ally from the other team, stood even taller between them. (It helps that he's actually taller than they are.) The problem is that McCain and Graham won't back Obama on his other priorities, and most Republicans won't even back him on that one. As the president discussed hiking the minimum wage to $9 an hour and indexing it to inflation, Rep. Greg Walden made exaggerated expressions of disbelief. Walden runs the National Republican Congressional Committee, tasked with keeping the House red. He's talked openly about how tight gerrymandering has shored up at least 191 of the 218 seats Republicans need to keep control. He wasn't hearing anything that threatened the party; thus, he wasn't hearing anything that could get their votes. The gun control issue was the most obvious proof. ""There are more people killed with baseball bats and hammers than are killed with guns,"" said Rep. Paul Broun, a Georgia conservative who's leaving an ultra-safe seat to run for the Senate. ""Universal background checks is actually a policy that's been put in place, historically, to lead to confiscation of guns. It's the most dangerous attack on freedom I've seen since I've been in Congress."" Broun is generally pretty useful to Democrats because he talks like--well, like that. Democrats, whose post-election optimism hasn't worn off, sell ready-made legislation that's endorsed by real, credible humans. Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, invited a woman named Cleora O'Connor to the speech, because her son had been killed by a gun and she wants Congress to act. ""They all stood up when the president said that line: We need to honor them with a vote,"" said Cicilline. ""Now, maybe they were standing up out of respect for the victims, not for the idea that we need to vote. But I thought it was powerful."" But Rep. Dennis Ross, a central Florida Republican who eschews Broun-style flamboyance, was more careful but still opposed to a gun bill. Maybe, maybe Democrats could build momentum for hearings on a gun bill. Republicans were learning, or re-learning, how to sound less harsh about this stuff. But what about the particulars? ""How do you enforce the law of a background check between everyday buyers and sellers?"" asked Ross. ""The practical application might lead to more problems than anything we have now."" And anyway, ""the evidence that foretells how far that can go, in this Congress, is that there were fewer Democratic senators standing for that than for [anything else]."" That fills Republicans with confidence. As Nugent talked to reporters, his sponsor, Rep. Steve Stockman, was standing more or less alone, discussing the lack of depth behind any gun bill push. ""I was listening to NPR this morning,"" said Stockman. ""Yes, I listen to NPR! The senator from West Virginia was on, and he said, 'Yeah, I'm for more gun control.' They said, 'Give us specifics.' And by the end of the interview he didn't really have any."" Nugent just kept moving from camera to camera, from the set-up satellite feeds in Statuary Hall to the hand-helds of independent reporters. Like the median House Republican, he had his constituency, and he knew it was bigger than the liberals'. ""If you walk the halls with me,"" he told a National Review writer, ""every military guy, every cop, has an Uncle Ted story. See the smile on my face? These are my buddies here. I'm surrounded by working hard, playing hard Americans."" Nugent was shepherded over to a standing MSNBC camera. Two police officers looked on, confused by the mobile media herd. ""Who's that?"" asked one cop. ""It's Ted Nugent,"" said the other cop. ""He's a rock star, he talks about guns."" ""Really? Never heard of him."""

That's good news for you. The pre-speech period, roughly 24 to 48 hours of spin and leaks, spoils the policy details that'll be remembered when the speech is complete. (I say ""policy"" because they obviously can't predict which lawmakers' eye-rolls will make the Top 10 .gif lists.) Based on my own close reading of this stuff, here's what will be happening in the House of Representatives tonight. Obama blames Republicans for things Republicans actually did, which will be seen as unfair. The White House's on-the-record guff to reporters has been notable for only one thing: its snark. It was not enough for White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer to give Politico's Mike Allen a preview of the speech. He had to gild the lily, prederiding the ""Beltway lens of the reporters who cover it and the pundits and politicos who tweet about it."" (Pfeiffer just cracked the 43,000 mark in Twitter followers.) This White House both understands that Republicans are trying to undermine it and fails to explain how they do so. In 2012's State of the Union, for example, Obama promised to create the Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group to go after banks more aggressively. The group fell to pieces on the launch pad. In the litany of ways that the administration failed to attack the foreclosure crisis, this ranks low, but it's instructive--Congress never appropriated the money to staff it. ""I think part of our frustration in the first four years,"" said White House consigliere Valerie Jarrett on MSNBC's Morning Joe, ""[was] often times seeing Republicans putting their short-term political interest ahead of what is in the best interest of our country."" The president might make that point by mentioning the bills and nominees held up by Republicans in, respectively, the House and the Senate. On Wednesday, Senate Democrats will hold an exasperated news conference on the GOP's filibuster threat against a possible director for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It's the sort of process whine that would get more attention if the president signs on. Republicans ask why Obama's still not endorsing their bills. The House Energy and Commerce Committee, which wasted most of the last term looking for a scandal in the Solyndra bankruptcy, pre-empted Obama by challenging him to discuss the Keystone XL pipeline. In their words (written in the first person but not actually attributed to any member of the committee), the pipeline was like a magic lamp wrapped in a magic carpet: ""With recent incidents of terrorism and unrest across the globe threatening energy prices, and negative economic growth and stubbornly high unemployment here at home, the Keystone XL pipeline would seemingly be a blessing and welcome component in any effort to rebuild the middle class."" And it'll rid you of that stubborn belly fat! An emotional appeal on gun rights grips America. In all of the soft-focus stories on the speech's invited guests, two names matter: Ted Nugent and Gabrielle Giffords. Texas Rep. Steve Stockman, an embarrassing member of the class of 1994 who lost in 1996 but managed to come back in 2012, has invited Nugent to attend the speech, despite Nugent being (humorously!) on record threatening the president's life. Giffords, invited by Sen. John McCain, is the most compelling figure in the gun control (sorry, ""gun safety"") movement. Democrats know that the mere sight of Giffords, or the sound of her voice, spurs a Pavlovian response: The listener cannot help but hear and think about ammo clips and background checks. Stockman knows ... actually, there's no way to end that sentence. Republicans accuse Obama of ignoring the debt, while basically agreeing with his approach to it. In his first State of the Union speech four years ago, the president returned again and again to the crisis of national debt. Washington, he said, had ""responsibility to ensure that we do not pass on to [our children] a debt they cannot pay."" That was $5.2 trillion ago, and Republicans will shame him for every dollar. ""The debt has a direct impact on unemployment,"" said Sen. Marco Rubio, sort of mystifyingly, in a Weekly Standard preview of his response to the speech Tuesday evening. ""Every dollar that is being lent to the government is a dollar that is not being invested in our economy."" The Washington Post's preview of the speech warned that the White House says the president won't say much more about debt, because ""if policymakers can agree on a strategy for replacing across-the-board spending cuts set to hit next month, Obama will pretty much have achieved what he has called 'our ultimate goal' of halting the rapid rise in government borrowing."" But Republicans and Obama agree on the concept. Getting to a balanced budget, someday, isn't a matter of austerity anymore. If the economy grows, the deficit shrinks. Rubio told the Weekly Standard that a ""pro-growth"" policy would generate ""an additional $4 trillion in revenues over the next decade."" Anyone with a basic grasp of math and chart-reading can see that the deficit is already shrinking, even before President Rubio gets his hands on it. Obama tells a horrendous, sub-Tosh.0 quality joke. He always does this, in bold defiance of his lack of comedic timing. (His funniest writer, Jon Lovett, left years ago to create a sitcom.) Last year, he took credit for the elimination of a regulation that was classifying dairy spills as disasters akin to--and as expensive in court as--oil spills. ""With a rule like that,"" he said. ""I guess it was worth crying over spilled milk."" Whatever joke Obama tells, it will be followed in the transcript with the annotation ""(laughter and applause).""

11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/02/chuck_hagel_confirmation_blocking_obama_s_nominees_is_currently_the_gop.html	"In a more boring and predictable world, Chuck Hagel would be one step closer to the Pentagon today. After last week's debacle in front of the Armed Services Committee, Hagel was given a week to provide the texts of speeches he'd given since leaving the Senate and proof of any ""financial remuneration"" he'd taken from foreign interests. On Wednesday morning, 24-odd hours before the committee would vote to recommend the nomination, Hagel shrugged--the speeches were off-the-cuff, the financial info didn't belong to him. And so perpetually exasperated committee chairman Carl Levin pushed off the vote. He really didn't want to. ""We can't not vote,"" he groused, ""because there is dissatisfaction on the part of people because that could be endless."" Pity the chairman. Just last month, he helped the Senate avert a blood-and-guts showdown over filibuster reform. Instead of taking away the 60-vote threshold to confirm a nominee, Levin helped shrink the debate time on a Cabinet nominee from 30 hours to eight. ""It will make it easier to confirm nominees in general,"" he told me. Since then, a gaggle of Republicans has threatened to filibuster Hagel and 42 Republicans have sworn to filibuster Consumer Finance Protection Board Director Richard Cordray. Why are Democrats perpetually shocked--shocked!--when Republicans throw hurdles in front of their nominees? For four full years, GOP senators have picked fights over appointments, delaying nominations when possible, occasionally throttling them outright. They did not invent the practice. The filibuster and the nominee hold are beloved senatorial powers, tweaked and improved every year. Who would want to trade this system for some sort of Mohammed Morsi-esque executive appointment-by-fiat? Nobody, that's who. The problem for this White House is that the senatorial privilege to block nominees is, currently, the GOP's best policy-making tool. Throughout the president's first term, Republicans held nominees to force the administration to the table on pet issues. This rarely worked. Typically, the nominees just up and quit. Louisiana Sen. David Vitter perfected the game. In early 2009, Vitter put a hold on Obama's FEMA nominee until he got a ""written commitment"" that the agency would settle a few lagging infrastructure issues in his state. That was typical senatorial kiss-the-ring-ism. Then, in 2010, in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon oil gusher, the administration put a moratorium on some offshore drilling. Vitter blocked Obama's nominee to head the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration because the administration didn't make the ""climate czar"" available to defend the science of the moratorium. The nominee surrendered. The battle continued on varied fronts. In May 2011, the president nominated Edison International President John Bryson to run the Department of Commerce. Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe accused Bryson of economic radicalism for his role in co-founding the Natural Resources Defense Council: ""If Bryson becomes secretary of commerce, economic growth in Oklahoma and across the nation could be in jeopardy."" There wouldn't be a vote on Bryson until five months after the nomination. First Sen. Richard Shelby, then Sen. Vitter--again--put holds on the president's nominees to the Federal Reserve. They didn't even pretend to have a procedural objection. They just didn't agree with the guys. ""I refuse to provide Chairman Bernanke with two more rubber stamps who approve of the Fed's activist policies,"" explained Vitter, getting his way. All of this happened after the top level administration was pretty much staffed. Most of Obama's first-term Cabinet was confirmed when the Senate consisted of 58 Democrats and 41 Republicans. (One of those Republicans, Arlen Specter, switched parties; a 60th Democrat arrived when Sen. Al Franken won his recount.) The Republicans have four additional votes now, along with a long list of grievances. The president's going to put forward new nominees at Labor, Commerce, Interior, and Energy, all the subject of controversies and Drudge sirens in the first term. He's going to keep nominating lower-level bureaucrats who, at this point, we just assume will get stuck. What do Republicans want in exchange for the big-ticket nominees? I asked Vitter's office what might need to happen before he lets an Energy or Interior nominee go through. ""This administration's five-year offshore leasing plan is half what the nation's previous plan was,"" said the senator in a statement. ""So my top question for the new interior nominee is simple: Does she think that's the right direction for us to move in?"" Other senators were less forthcoming, either ignoring the question or mentioning short-term disputes--an EPA ruling here or there--that can probably be cleared away. That makes sense: Why say anything before the Obama administration reveals which pinata it's going to gift them? When I asked one senator whether a filibuster was likely against the Hagel nomination, I was quickly told that a Cabinet-level nominee filibuster ""wouldn't be unprecedented"" like the media keep on saying. Meanwhile, the White House affects a no-panic stance on this stuff. It portrays the anti-Hagel backlash as doomed. ""This will be forever remembered as the press trying to make a thing when there is none,"" said one aide Thursday. For every Ted Cruz, leading a strike force to take down a nominee, there's a Republican or 10 who's willing to let it slide. The White House has to copy Levin's approach--be calm, grimace, move on. Try to prevent policy-making-by-filibuster from becoming the standard. There will be allies, and unexpected ones. ""If it were [based only] on policy reasons, I would never vote for any of President Obama's nominees,"" says Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. ""I'm not sure the Constitution tells you exactly: What is advise and consent? Are you only supposed to rule out and vote against people who you think are criminal or have unpatriotic backgrounds? Are you supposed to rule out people you disagree with politically? In the past there's been some latitude for presidents ... and if I do end up voting for some of these nominees, I don't think anybody in my state or in the conservative community will think I'm going soft on the president."""

""Make our day--let the photoshop conspiracies begin!"" It was Feb. 3, a week and change since Plouffe had left the White House and joined Twitter, and he was already on top of a meme. The New Republic had asked President Obama whether he'd ever shot a gun. ""Up at Camp David,"" he'd said, ""we do skeet shooting all the time."" A small number of conservatives asked--totally reasonably--whether there was any proof. The White House released a photo of the president firing a shotgun. But it did so by having deputy communications director Dan Pfeiffer call the critics ""skeeters,"" and then came Plouffe, egging it on. ""Day made,"" he tweeted, hours later. ""The skeet birthers are out in full force in response to POTUS pic. Makes for most excellent, delusional reading. #whereistrump"" Why, in 2013, is the White House still talking about Donald Trump? Has any of its domestic enemies been vanquished as completely as the host of The Apprentice? No, none of them have. The point of this exercise didn't become clear until Tuesday, when House Majority Leader Eric Cantor wrapped up a sophisticated two-day exercise in Republican rebranding. Day 1 meant a visit to a D.C. charter school with media in tow. (""Eric Cantor grabs a plastic dinosaur from the pile of toys in front of one-year-old Mekhi Scott, taps the beast on the table and growls, RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!"") Day two meant an hourlong speech at the American Enterprise Institute, flanked by Real Americans Who Feel the Real Impact of Washington. ""With us today is Erin Shucosky,"" said Cantor. ""Erin has been a clinical nurse for 30 years in Baltimore. She spent the past 10 years coordinating the research on a study to approve new replacement discs to treat patients suffering from crippling neck and back pain."" Alas, ""the new medical device tax in Obamacare makes it harder for researchers to develop these innovative devices in the U.S. and thus makes it harder for patients like Erin to get the care they need."" Republicans have been talking about scrapping that medical device tax since five or six seconds after Obamacare passed. Democrats like Elizabeth Warren have joined them. A Google News search on that tax reveals around 3,200 recent stories. A search for tales of Obama and the great skeet hunt: 135,000. The easy knock on the Republican ""rebranding"" campaign is that it microwaves ideas and gimmicks from previous, partially successful campaigns. This White House makes that harder, because it has an intuitive understanding of what could make Republicans look stupid. The Republicans are aware of this tactic, and they resent it, one of them describing it to me as ""finding four people on Twitter and making it look like they speak for us."" But it usually works. In 2008, as Plouffe recalls in his memoir The Audacity to Win, the Obama campaign repeatedly pivoted away from damaging stories by making the stories themselves sound nutty. They focus-grouped possible attacks on Obama's friendship with Bill Ayers, and according to Plouffe, ""it became clear we could not blow off the subject as simply more negative politics from McCain."" But the McCain campaign ""utterly flubbed their injection of the Ayers argument into the main artery of their communications."" Its vessel was not McCain, but Sarah Palin, ""who had almost zero credibility and little standing with the broader electorate."" This continued into 2009. But after the election, for a while, it stopped working. The White House portrayed Republican obstinacy as kookery, elevating the most colorful-sounding kooks. On Feb. 19, 2009, CNBC's Rick Santelli denounced the nascent Homeowners Affordability and Stability Plan and called for a ""Chicago Tea Party"" to protest this plan to bail out ""the losers' mortgages."" Asked about it the next day, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs delivered a long, prepared denunciation of Santelli, daring him to drink ""decaf."" This only inflamed the Tea Party. From then through 2010, Democrats hoped that the most extreme-looking Republicans would bring the entire party down around them. They didn't. The GOP's opposition was actually mostly popular, because the 2010 electorate and (to a lesser extent) the broader public also opposed the president's health care bill, and doubted that the 2009 stimulus package had worked. The Republican House of Representatives changed that relationship. After the debt limit fight of 2011, voters consistently blamed Congress, not the president, for Washington's inexplicable manias. And that's why Republicans have launched the ever-evolving rebrand. Cantor's AEI speech was crafted to tie every Republican idea to a Hallmark movie problem. Instead of talking ""tax reform,"" there was this: ""In our attempt to make the tax code simpler, we must continue to demonstrate support for young parents who invest in having kids and raising a family."" Instead of a lecture on school choice, there was the tale of Rashawn, who ""flunked the first grade"" and was put ""in special education classes,"" so broken is the system. Every Republican leadership move this year has been designed to take away the president's ""kook"" card. That was clear on Tuesday, as the party rejoiced at news that the president wanted ""tens of billions of dollars in short-term spending cuts and tax revenue"" to replace the scheduled cuts of sequestration. They're aware of just how easy it is for the president to portray them as radical, and to spotlight their weirdest tics, and that he will get another chance to do this next week at the State of the Union. But how reasonable do they need to sound before people pay attention to them? They are learning that, at a speed much slower than skeet."

13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/01/chuck_hagel_confirmation_hearing_the_former_nebraska_senator_performed_poorly.html	"Everyone who paid a little attention to Chuck Hagel's nomination to run the Department of Defense knew that he'd have to answer for his juicy quotes about Israel and foreign policy. At least, everyone should have told Chuck Hagel. For seven hours, his answers to Republicans in the Senate Armed Services Committee--one of his old committees!--ranged from passable to apocalyptic. ""Explain this a bit,"" said South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who was a Hagel critic before he was even nominated. ""You said, 'The Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people up here.' 'I'm not an Israeli senator; I'm a United States senator.' 'This pressure makes us do dumb things at times.' "" That last quote wasn't even correct. In a 2006 interview with Aaron David Miller, one of the most famous pieces of Hageliana, the senator said he'd ""argued against the dumb things they do""--they being the Israel lobby. He didn't sign one particular open letter supporting Israel because ""it was a stupid letter."" But Graham ran with the misquote. ""Name one person in your opinion who's intimidated by the Israeli lobby,"" he said. ""Well, uh, first ... "" started Hagel. Graham interrupted him. ""Name one."" Hagel shrugged. ""Uh, I don't know."" Three weeks ago, Hagel broke typical nominee protocol by talking to the media--the Lincoln (Neb.) Journal Star--and rebutting this attack. ""I didn't sign on to certain resolutions and letters because they were counter-productive and didn't solve a problem,"" he said. He'd ducked some popular pro-Israel letters in resolutions because they couldn't answer his question: ""How does that further the peace process in the Middle East?"" But when it counted, Hagel drifted. ""Well, why would you say that?"" asked Graham. ""I didn't have in mind a specific person ..."" started Hagel. ""It was an injurious, provocative statement,"" said Graham. ""I can't think of a more provocative thing to say about the relationship between the United States and Israel, and the Senate and the Congress, than what you said."" Hagel has one of the saddest faces in politics, one that used to be captured in black and white for magazine profiles about his manful truth-telling. ""Hagel is typically more interested in facts on the ground than doctrine,"" wrote Joseph Lelyveld in a 2006 take, when Hagel was daydreaming about the 2008 presidential nomination. ""He's a politician with attributes that are supposedly sought by the people who package candidates."" Graham, a former JAG lawyer, made that media hero unrecognizable. He jerked around in his chair, as if Hagel's dissembling caused him physical pain. When an answer started to wander, Graham cut it short--""I gotcha""--and moved on. It shouldn't have mattered. The promise of Chuck Hagel was (or is--he's only got to win over four Republicans to forestall a rare Cabinet nominee filibuster) the truth-telling. Hagel has less executive experience than any DOD nominee in decades, but he bonded with Democrats because of a years-long, realist approach to Israel, Iran, and the defense budget. In 2006, Democrats ran against the war in Iraq and won; in 2008, they defeated the chief Republican proponent of the surge; in 2012, they won the Jewish vote again against a historic campaign to portray them as anti-Zionists. Hagel's goal Thursday was to consolidate that by getting at least one Republican on the committee to come out for him. Democrats hold 14 of 26 seats on Senate Armed Services, and none of them have hinted that they oppose Hagel. It made sense for Hagel to be demure--more sense than it made, say, for Barack Obama to approach his first debate with Mitt Romney as a do-no-harm scenario. But the result was a nominee who searched for words like he was trapped in a closet, grasping for a dropped flashlight. Democrats praised Hagel's Vietnam service, to the extent that Hagel encouraged them to ask about policy instead. He couldn't get granular on any of that, he said, but ""if confirmed, I intend to know a lot more than I do."" Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, a Hagel supporter, asked a pillowy-soft question about the nominee's conversations with the president. ""When he asked me why am I qualified,"" said Hagel, ""I said I'm not."" This was campaign-profile talk transplanted with maximum awkwardness to a situation in which people wanted to hear about expertise. More expertise might have staved off the Republican doubts. Acting contrite got Hagel nowhere. Early in the day, timed just right to set the whole narrative, Sen. John McCain asked Hagel to renounce his old skepticism of the surge in Iraq. ""Do you stand by those comments?"" asked McCain. ""Senator,"" said Hagel, ""I stand by them because I made them."" ""Were you right?"" asked McCain. ""Were you correct in your assessment?"" ""I would defer to the judgment of history,"" said Hagel. ""I think this committee deserves your judgment as to whether you were right or wrong!"" said McCain. It went on until McCain, deeply unsatisfied, switched to a line of Syria questions. The Democrat assigned to clean up, Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, tried to help out Hagel by pointing out the long-term cost and disaster of the Iraq War as a whole--forget the surge. But Hagel meandered into an apology about his vote that contradicted his answer to McCain and contradicted seven years of his career. ""Doesn't mean I'm right,"" he said. ""Doesn't mean I didn't make wrong votes."" What was the point of that? Instead of trying to convince skeptical Republicans of his rightness, Hagel accepted their premises, his logical threads collapsing into black holes. Sen. Kelly Ayotte reminded Hagel of a speech he'd given listing ""containment"" as a possible response to the dangers posed by Iran. Hagel could have defended the speech (""containment"" was at the end of a list of better options) or explained why his thinking evolved. Instead, he suggested that ""it doesn't matter what I think,"" because he'd mind-melded with the president. Michigan Sen. Carl Levin bailed out his former colleague. ""You said to Sen. Ayotte, 'It doesn't matter what I believe,' "" he said. ""Of course, it does matter what you believe. I think what you were saying was, 'What does matter is what the president believes.' "" Yes. That was what he meant. During one break, Hagel turned to a friend in the rows directly behind him and joked wryly about how he had good speeches he'd never written down. The hearing continued. Hagel answered questions about another speech with ""I don't recall the event. I don't recall the words. I don't know the context."" The studied ignorance of modern judicial confirmation hearings had come to Armed Services, but the graft wasn't taking. But the irony stuck. Most Republican questions scored Hagel not for his views on defense spending but on his support of Israel and foreign policy in the neighborhood. ""I've seen a number of times,"" said Sen. Roy Blunt, ""you've said you're pro-Israel, but you don't have to be reflexively what Israel is for."" That was the totality of Blunt's argument--well, that and how Hagel had been saluted by University of Chicago political scientist John Mearsheimer, one of the co-authors of The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy. Lindsey Graham had wanted to know who had ever been spooked by The Lobby and what stupid things they'd done out of panic. The answer was right in front of him, at the witness table."

14	14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/01/marco_rubio_is_hoping_immigration_will_help_make_him_a_republican_party.html	"Sen. Marco Rubio is having a moment. He's a charismatic senator from a battleground state whose Cuban heritage and support for immigration reform are helping his party begin a new courtship with Hispanic voters. This much we know. But Rubio is exploiting an opportunity that goes beyond simply good timing and the right last name. He is getting the chance to be first at bat in a larger effort: the post-election audition for GOP leadership. Of all the would-be Republican stars--and the list is long and likely to grow--Rubio is getting a chance to show exactly what it looks like to move the party in a new direction. Lots of conservatives are giving advice about how the Republican Party can evolve after the 2012 election. Paul Ryan, Bobby Jindal, Charles Krauthammer, and the National Review have all weighed in with a message of principle mixed with prudence. That's just talk. Rubio has given his speech about party direction, too. But he's now getting a chance to demonstrate some important political skills beyond speech-making that show whether he can actually help steer the new course, not just call for one. This is the first test of the New Year's resolutions. Senators--particularly freshman senators with no executive experience--don't get a lot of opportunities to show their skills in action. In the sweepstakes to be a national Republican leader--and then possible presidential candidate--the advantage usually goes to the governors. They can take actions that show tangible results while distancing themselves from a deeply unpopular Washington. Chris Christie and Bobby Jindal are both taking this approach. Christie's Boehner bashing and leadership in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy has helped drive the New Jersey governor's approval ratings skyward. The most important political skill is midwifery. The leader who moves the Republican Party into a new era, where it is more attractive to middle-class voters, minorities, and younger voters, will need to communicate a vision as well as communicate back to the base how he is not selling out the party's core principles. In this effort, Rubio will get a crack at showing key presidential governing skills--the ability to nurse complex legislation by identifying common interests with Democrats while working with Republicans friends through a mixture of cajoling, flattery, and strong-arming. Some might think Rubio's moment isn't a real test. The GOP needs to improve its image, and he's got the background to do it. Sure, after the 2012 election, some conservative elites switched their position on immigration reforms--Sean Hannity setting the land-speed record--and that makes Rubio's pitch easier. But maintenance of long-held truths in the face of the crowd's push for ""progress"" is among the highest of conservative attributes. And there are plenty of other influential voices and activists who think principles don't change just because the elections don't go well. There is opposition from Erick Erickson at Red State, former House Judiciary Committee chairman Lamar Smith, and Rush Limbaugh. As Bryan Fischer of the American Family Association put it, playing off of the famous William F. Buckley line, ""On immigration, it's time for conservatives to stand athwart Marco Rubio and yell, 'Stop!' "" And on Wednesday Sen. David Vitter told conservative radio show host Laura Ingraham that Rubio is ""amazingly naive"" and ""nuts"" for supporting the ""ridiculous"" bipartisan immigration reform proposal. More broadly, there is skepticism even about the political imperative that underlies the new push. Rush Limbaugh argues that Hispanic votes can never be won because they are addicted to social welfare. Rep. Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania made a similar case recently. They have a point about the relationship of Hispanic voters to GOP philosophy. Rubio must convince that audience--and the activist viewpoint they represent--of the merits of his new approach that go beyond political expediency. In this, Rubio's task is a microcosm of the larger task all would-be national leaders are assigning themselves as the GOP tries to reverse the trend that has led to five popular-vote losses in the last six elections: How do you adapt without changing? That's why Rubio's conversation about immigration quickly morphs into his pitch for limited government. Rubio is quick on his feet, and he'll need to be to manage two tough tasks: keeping his membership in the bipartisan ""gang of eight"" that includes liberal Sens. Chuck Schumer and Robert Menendez while also keeping the promises he has been making on talk radio. When Sen. Barack Obama tried this during negotiations over a lobbying and ethics bill with John McCain, the effort collapsed. Whether it was because Sen. Obama couldn't buck his party leaders or because McCain simply didn't trust him, Obama was unable to pull off the same trick that Rubio is now trying. Marco Rubio doesn't have to succeed fully either. Or, more precisely, success for comprehensive immigration reform is not the same as success for Marco Rubio. Legislative accomplishment may burnish Rubio's image with a broader electorate, but that's not his only constituency. He's building relationships with conservatives that will pay off down the road on a host of other issues. If he withdraws his support of the Senate effort as it goes forward--as Conn Carroll suggests he might--Rubio will show that new prudence doesn't just mean caving. In the long grope for a new direction, avoiding the new wrong way may serve Rubio's long-term political interests just fine."	Will Immigration Turn Marco Rubio Into a Presidential Contender?

15	15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/02/republican_party_s_sequestration_strategy_the_gop_fails_to_realize_that.html	"The last halfhearted hopes of a sequestration fix died Thursday afternoon, with Senate Republicans voting to give more power to President Obama. The plan was anonymously titled S. 16--a missed opportunity, after Democrats spangled their bill with stars and called it the American Family Economic Protection Act. Republican Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe and Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey were less interested in a name than in details. Their bill replaced the meat-axe cuts of the Budget Control Act with flexibility: ""The Secretary of Defense may transfer amounts appropriated for the Department of Defense by the Continuing Appropriations Resolution."" This plan failed. Thirty-six Republicans and two Democrats backed it, leaving them 22 votes short of cloture. But why were most Republicans ready to put $85 billion worth of spending cuts on the president, asking his agencies to make the choices? Why not make that call for themselves? Surely they, and not Barack Obama, know which planes need to be built and which military bases need to stay open. After the vote, Inhofe reminded me that the bill would have required the president to preview his cuts for Congress. Congress could have overridden the cuts, if it came to that. ""For those people who think I'm giving the president more power, they don't know me or my relationship with the president,"" he said. ""Our bill merely gives the administration the capacity to rearrange the cuts, so that they're not so devastating."" Republicans have one goal, running through all of these negotiations. They don't want sequestration to be replaced by tax revenue. Any tax revenue. Forcing the president to swallow $85 billion in cuts this year would do that. They've got no obvious alternatives. But a plan like this exposes a quirk of Obama-era fiscal hawksmanship. Republicans want specific cuts. Some of them--total repeal of Obamacare!--they'll put on the record. The rest of them, they try to put on the White House. As soon as the ""supercommittee"" failed and sequestration looked real, it became ""the president's sequester."" The 2011 debt-limit deal delayed real action until after the 2012 election, betting $1.2 trillion of chips on its results and giving them to the president. Even the first great structural victory of the Tea Party, the ban on legislative earmarks, handed more clout to the White House. ""The power to make thousands of spending decisions, on everything from which flood control projects will be funded to how spending on military bases will be distributed, to President Obama,"" warned two political scientists at the time. Republicans ignored those particular political scientists. Vote by vote, accidentally, Republicans are endorsing an imperial vision of the presidency. Perhaps they're picking this up by osmosis. The default position of the punditocracy is that the president must lead. The lazy pundit invokes Harry Truman's desk ornament, ""The Buck Stops Here,"" as a totem of great wisdom. Brendan Nyhan, who isn't lazy, calls this ""the Green Lantern Theory of the Presidency,"" after the D.C. Comics superhero and his ring that runs on willpower. Bob Woodward offered a sterling example of the theory this week, when he suggested that the president's willingness to obey the Budget Control Act (the law that mandates sequestration) was ""madness."" ""Can you imagine Ronald Reagan sitting there saying, 'Oh, by the way, I can't do this because of some budget document?'"" asked Woodward. ""Under the Constitution, the president is commander in chief and employs the force."" Indeed he is, but when the president does it, it's not always legal. The president can only spend what Congress appropriates. Prior Congresses, just as aggressive as this Republican-run House, have used that power to cut off money, like the Nixon-era Democrats did when they stanched the budget for the Vietnam War. And when they took over the House in 2011, John Boehner's Republicans immediately introduced a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. But this assortment of Republicans is less sure how to exercise power. ""I think there's a realization among House Republicans that Barack Obama is not Bill Clinton,"" said Ohio Rep. Pat Tiberi, one of the conference's leading tax-reform voices. ""If Bill Clinton were president, giving him flexibility would be an OK thing. Unfortunately, the trust level between House Republicans and this administration, how they've politicized almost everything? Gee, he might use flexibility to make sequestration worse than it could be!"" So a mile-wide gulf cracks open between that theory of the president and the dominant, make-him-own-the-cuts theory. ""Frankly, I think the administration will have very few options,"" said one Republican member of Congress who favored the ""flexibility"" bill. ""You have to go to administrative costs and overhead, procurements that aren't working--you have a limited number of things to work with. If they're going to do something like shut down Guantanamo, it's going to cost more money, not less."" After Friday, when the sequestration becomes a real thing, Republicans will get another, harder choice between the theories. At the end of March, they need to pass a new appropriations bill to fund the government. They can pass an omnibus bill, combining all the spending plans they need. That would put the onus on Congress to define how the money gets spent. Alternatively, they can pass a continuing resolution, spending numbers based on the Budget Control Act. That would keep the onus on the White House; that's the plan most likely to rise to the top. But that'll happen later. On Thursday, Democrats helped defeat the ""flexibility"" plan, then denounced Republicans who filibustered the Democrats sequestration fix--a combination of spending cuts and tax increases. ""[A fellow senator] mentioned the president's budget as if that is controlling!"" said retiring Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, a Democrat. ""Are we now hearing from the other side that we should just carte blanche rubber stamp the president's budget? I hope not!"" All but four Senate Democrats backed the ""balanced"" sequestration fix. (Sen. Harry Reid, one of the four, opposed it as a procedural measure, as a way to reconsider it later.) Republicans rushed out with statements pointing out that they had wanted to give the president the power to re-order sequester cuts but that Senate Democrats refused to lead and pass a bill. Kansas Republican Sen. Jerry Moran, the forgotten member of the forgotten ""Tea Party Caucus,"" took his place on the floor to denounce ""a reliance on ridiculous gimmicks to solve our problems."" He was referring to the Democrats."	The GOP's Sequestration Strategy Only Makes Obama Stronger	['Buck', 'Inhofe', 'Clinton', 'Obama', 'Toomey']	[]
16	16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/02/chuck_hagel_confirmed_as_secretary_of_defense_rand_paul_s_flip_flop_on_the.html	"Shortly before noon, before the vote on whether to move forward on Chuck Hagel's nomination for secretary of defense, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul walked onto the floor of the Senate. He stood near the well, where he would have to cast his vote. After Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander cast the first vote--an aye--he and Paul chatted off to the side. When his own name came up in the roll call--""Mr. Paul?""--Paul said nothing. Nearly half of Paul's fellow senators voted in the first alphabetical run-through of names. It was clear, almost immediately, that Hagel would have enough votes to break a filibuster. Paul walked over to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, the unofficial whip of the unofficial Dump Hagel campaign, spoke briefly, then returned to the well. He cast his vote. ""Mr. Paul, no."" Hagel was vaulting over this final hurdle, but Paul wasn't going to help. Two weeks earlier, Paul had cast a decisive vote against cloture, making Hagel the first-ever national security nominee to face a filibuster. ""There's all kinds of rumors all over the Internet about foreign groups that may have provided financing,"" explained Paul, ""and I think he needs to reveal that."" Had Paul voted the other way, Hagel wouldn't have spent those extra days being beat up by hawkish Republicans, Washington Post blogger Jennifer Rubin, and groups like the Emergency Committee for Israel. Forty other Republicans joined Paul on that first filibuster, and 26 more joined him in the first vote opposing cloture today. But conservative foreign policy ""realists,"" the sort of people who backed Rep. Ron Paul's campaigns for president, were uniquely disappointed in the heir. ""Sen. Paul is aiding and abetting a disgusting McCarthyite campaign against an honorable man,"" wrote AntiWar.com's Justin Raimondo. ""Paul endorsed one of the worst, least credible anti-Hagel arguments of all,"" wrote American Conservative columnist Daniel Larison, ""which is essentially the Ted Cruz argument that Hagel needs to 'prove' that he is not in league with foreign governments or sympathetic with terrorists."" Overcoming that kind of guilt-by-association politics was one of the points of the Hagel nomination. Wasn't it? Rand Paul, too, had challenged the wisdom of the neoconservatives and been battered for it. If Hagel could be confirmed, it would mean you could name and shame the ""Israel lobby"" (or, okay, the ""Jewish lobby"") without being banished to Siberia. If the Senate really debated Hagel's views, really revisited the wisdom of the Iraq War and whether the 2007 surge worked and whether Iran can't ever be negotiated with, it would expand the aperture of ""serious"" foreign policy debate. Paul was aware of that. To him, delaying Hagel was in keeping with the actual goals of the realists and libertarians. ""I wanted to get more information not only on Hagel but more information on [CIA nominee John] Brennan,"" he said, after leaving the post-vote Republican luncheon. ""That didn't work because we didn't stick together on it. Last week's vote was useless. If you don't stick together, you won't have leverage."" And Paul will now turn his attention to the Brennan nomination, to demand and get more answers on the legality of the drone program and whether Americans, on American soil, could be targeted for killing. ""It's blatantly illegal--we have probably a dozen laws saying the CIA can't operate in the United States, and neither can the Department of Defense."" That wasn't obvious to libertarians and paleo-conservatives. One year ago, Sen. Paul was criss-crossing key Republican primary and caucus states to whip up support for presidential candidate Ron Paul. I remember cranking the speedometer of a rental car, and parking illegally near the University of Northern Iowa, to see the Pauls work a fire-hazard-crowded ballroom. Ron Paul would go on to win that county. Rand Paul would go on to filibuster Chuck Hagel. ""Speaking for myself only, I do not support Rand Paul and have not for quite some time now,"" said Ryan Langer, who leads the University of Northern Iowa's Young Americans for Liberty chapter, a pro-Ron Paul organization. ""In my opinion, while he may share his father's last name, he certainly doesn't share his principles, the Hagel vote just being further evidence of that."" Rand Paul flat-out rejected that characterization. ""I will say to anybody from the libertarian side who wants to believe that Hagel is the next coming of Harry Browne that they need to read a little more about his past,"" he said. (Browne, the two-time Libertarian Party nominee for president, blamed 9/11 on an ""insane"" American foreign policy.) ""Hagel's been a promoter of the draft. Not a very libertarian idea. He's been a promoter of U.N. peacekeeping troops around the world, and intervention. He doesn't like unilateral intervention, but he's fine with group intervention around the world. He voted for the PATRIOT Act. He voted for the Iraq War."" But neither the Hagel campaign nor the Dump Hagel campaign really ever got to those issues. The Dump Hagel movement had no grand strategy larger than ""Let's see if this sticks to him."" Challenging his philosophy wouldn't slow him down, so the Washington Free Beacon and Hagel skeptics scoured public and private records for damaging quotes. Sen. Lindsey Graham personally sent Hagel three letters asking him to explain speeches--did he really call the State Department an ""adjunct"" of Israel's foreign ministry?--and asking him to let reporters check out his Senate papers, locked up at the University of Nebraska-Omaha. Sen. John Cornyn went after Hagel with a gambit that probably backfired: A letter from 15 senators asking the president to withdraw the nomination, for the tautological reason that ""no Secretary of Defense has been confirmed and taken office with more than three Senators voting against him."" Democrats shrugged this stuff off. ""Some of the opposition to Hagel was really over the top,"" said Michigan Sen. Carl Levin on Tuesday. ""It kind of answered itself by the end. It was kind of self-defeating."" Yet the Democrats never really tried to defend Hagel on the merits. They never cited the New Yorker-profile-ready quotes that made Hagel a star in 2006 and 2007. Libertarians wanted that defense to come from Paul. Three years earlier, he humiliated neoconservatives who tried to crush his Senate campaign on the grounds that he wasn't hawkish. ""On foreign policy, [global war on terror], Gitmo, Afghanistan, Rand Paul is NOT one of us,"" wrote Cesar Conda--a Cheney aide who would become Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's chief of staff. Paul got that. Some of the loudest Hagel critics, he said, were ""people who've been mean-spirited to my dad."" That was an ""enemy of my enemy is my friend"" approach, and he didn't share it. ""They're basing [their support] more on the vitriol against him, and probably, some of that wasn't fair. You could vote against Hagel for libertarian reasons, you could vote against him for conservative reasons."" With that, Paul said he still might ""give the president the prerogative to choose his Cabinet,"" and he wrapped the interview. Four hours later, Paul returned to the Senate floor. Here was the actual vote that would make Hagel the next secretary of defense, and he needed only 51 votes to be confirmed--a fait accompli. One after another, Republicans who'd given Hagel an ""aye"" on cloture switched and voted ""nay."" Their votes would allow Bill Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard and chairman of the Emergency Committee for Israel, to say that ""the overwhelming majority of senators from one of the two major parties voted against confirming Mr. Hagel."" Paul walked to the well of the Senate with a group of fellow Republicans. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who'd voted yes on cloture after Hagel answered his letters, voted against his confirmation. A grinning Sen. Cornyn gratefully shook his hand. Then Paul leaned over the well to announce his vote. ""Aye,"" he said. The final tally was 58-to-41, but no other senator voted this way. Hours earlier, the Emergency Committee for Israel had given me a tentative statement congratulating Paul for ""a pro-Israel vote today."" They cancelled that statement, effective immediately."

This was not supposed to happen. The center-left Italian Democrats spent the entire campaign with strong leads in the polls. Foreign reporters swooned over ""Operation Ohio,"" fresh-scrubbed Italian politicos trained by the Obama campaign taking their new tactics into swing state Lombardy. Then came Beppe Grillo, a brillo-haired, economics-trained comic with a blog and a 1980 vehicular manslaughter conviction. His Five Star Movement ticket looked completely ridiculous, until it surged into third place. Grillo's rallies attracted tens of thousands of people, then 100,000. Grillo's platform called for a living wage and for priests to have children ""so they don't touch other people's."" That, added to his aggressive social media campaign--nearly a million followers on Twitter--carved out 25 percent of the vote, denying a majority to the center-left, sending investors into a now-familiar panic, the Dow Jones index falling by 216 points. After all, this is Italy we're talking about. Political stasis is such a steady part of Italian life that the lede to one Associated Press story--""investors worry that Italy could be seized with political paralysis""--was an accidental fount of chuckles. What makes Grillo interesting is the way his Five Star Movement was built. The candidate list was assembled in online conventions. Party members clicked the names of three candidates, and those with the most clicks got onto the ballot. That was exactly what the late, unlamented Americans Elect Party tried to do in 2011 and 2012. They spent $35 million and held an online convention, asking real people to pick a bipartisan ticket. A few thousand people voted to nominate Buddy Roemer--and this was after the Republican gadfly actually campaigned for the nomination. It failed spectacularly for Americans Elect, so why did it work for Grillo? Easy: No matter how much money is shoveled over to ""centrists,"" political change doesn't come from reasonable people. It grows out of mania and cold fury. ""A third party needs some igniting figure,"" says Bill Hillsman, who made ads for Jesse Ventura when he was elected governor of Minnesota. ""That was the failure with Americans Elect. Our office actually called Americans Elect at one point and asked, hey, do you need to be a Republican or a Democrat to get nominated? They waited three days. Then they called us and they said, well, if a true independent went on the ticket, the other person would have to be a Democrat or a Republican."" As it collapsed, Americans Elect launched a quasi-campaign to promote the possible candidacy of David Walker. Here was a pleasant but colorless former U.S. comptroller who banged on constantly about the need for a grand bargain. For some reason, Americans didn't rush to hoist his banner. ""People are telling you that you have to have austerity, austerity, austerity,"" says Hillsman. ""Then the government is doing all this profligate spending and unethical things. This is the dynamic in America: We want to express our dissatisfaction in the most memorable way possible. We want to start throwing TVs out windows."" There's a lot of that going around. Italy's Grillo tantrum is the latest in a series of voter rebellions, in wildly different systems, all in countries where faith in the establishment has collapsed. In Germany, the libertarian Free Democratic Party, a frequent coalition partner in government, has collapsed to a third of its previous support. The Pirate Party--one of many European parties with that name, and with a left-right platform of guaranteed income and copyright freedom--has surged into the gap. In Haiti, Western investors largely wanted the ruling Unity Party to take the 2011-12 presidential elections. The winner, after a string of crises, was a dancehall singer named Michel ""Sweet Micky"" Martelly, who rose from joke status to become the candidate of anti-government fury. In Greece, the Golden Dawn party--reconstructed neo-Nazis in a country once terrorized by the Nazis--entered the 2012 elections as a fringe group with a base of 20,000 votes. They ended up with more than 420,000 votes and 18 seats in Parliament. Anyone trying to find some ideological linkage across the time zones is going to come up empty. That Greek election, which gave a narrow victory to European Union-backed austerity-crats, looks like a miracle compared with the mess in Italy. The only constant: Voters despise their choices and swing for the ""screw it, blow up everything"" party over the austerity party. ""I take what happened in Italy as a good sign,"" says Kinky Friedman, the country singer/novelist/amateur politician who ran for governor of Texas in 2006. ""I think if Jesus were to run here in Texas as an independent, he wouldn't do as well as they did."" In 2006, before the economic crisis, Friedman got around 547,000 votes with a grab bag of issues and a simple slogan: ""Why the hell not?"" He's still inscrutable. Two years ago he endorsed Rick Perry for president; he now says that his ""dying wish is to be cremated, and have the ashes thrown in Rick Perry's hair."" This is Friedman's way of saying he'll probably run for the Democratic nomination this time, campaigning to legalize casinos and marijuana, working inside the party structure to destroy what the parties stand for. The dream of a prefab centrist party has no real constituency. The crazy rejectionist movement has lots of constituencies, all over the planet. ""L'onesta andra di moda!"" tweeted Beppe Grillo as the votes came in. In English: ""Honesty will be fashionable again!"""

18	18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/02/bob_woodward_sequestration_republicans_blaming_barack_obama_for_the_sequester.html	"We are headed into the peak week of sequestration insanity. The across-the-board budget cuts known as sequestration are set to take effect on March 1. Here's a simple rule for getting through the next few days: If you're talking about sequestration, you're doing it wrong. Sequestration was created to focus minds on the Big Thing. So if you're talking obsessively about the sequestration, it means you aren't thinking about the thing that you were supposed to be focused on. First, the Big Thing. The two parties need to come to an agreement on how to spur economic growth to spread prosperity and reduce the budget deficit. The president believes growth comes from a balance of tax increases, investment, and spending reductions. Republicans believe growth comes through lower taxes and spending reductions, which in turn will spur companies to hire and invest. The president believes that taxes should increase as a matter of fairness because the system is tilted in favor of the wealthy and well-connected. Republicans believe that the federal government is already taking an unfair amount of taxes from everyone. Even if this is obvious, it's very hard to get people to focus on the Big Thing, so lawmakers tried to come up with a mechanism to center people's thinking. They placed a big hairy monster outside the door to keep everyone focused on the Big Thing, and they named this monster Sequestration. Right now, the political world is engaged in a debate about the monster, not the Big Thing. That means that right now the public debate is irrelevant. Even worse, the public debate has become a glittery multiweek jamboree dedicated to displaying the madness that puts us in our current budgetary predicament. It is as if faced with a drinking problem, we decided to engage in all of the behavior that led to the binges, hangovers, and blackouts in the first place. There are two examples of this dispiriting distraction: the long and tedious debate over who came up with the sequester idea and the new debate over whether tax increases were supposed to be a part of it. The president and his aides at first tried to deny that they invented sequestration (mostly false!), but it is clear that the president and his team proposed the idea. Instead of trying to weasel out and blame the idea on the Republicans, the president should own it: Yes, it was my idea to create a monster to force all of us to focus on the Big Thing, and the fact that you still won't focus is the proof that it was necessary to create it. But President Obama won't do this because the monster is ready to break through the door, and the president doesn't want to be blamed for the wreckage. But if it's obvious the president came up with the idea, it's also obvious that it doesn't matter who came up with it. First, the Big Thing matters. Remember: focus. Second, a majority of Republicans voted for sequestration. Once everyone agrees to order the monster from Acme and take off his chains, it doesn't matter who suggested it first. Everyone agreed. Finally, the hunt to pin down whether Obama is shrinking from responsibility or whether John Boehner once boasted about it doesn't tell us anything about either the president or the House speaker. Normally if politicians tried to duck blame for a policy they once advocated, we would be very interested in their duplicity. They thought something was good, but now they think it's bad. Don't trust them. They're slippery. But in this case sequestration was never designed to be good. It was not designed to be a piece of policy. Everyone agreed that sequestration cuts were supposed to be so bad that prudent lawmakers on both sides would seek to avoid them by coming up with an alternative. So the fact that either side is trying to avoid sequestration--by denying provenance, pointing fingers, or raiding the minibar--is not a bug, it's a feature. If we're going to focus on expected things when they come to pass, I suggest focusing on the sunrise because a nice sunrise is really pretty. Also, the laughter of children trying to avoid bedtime is neat. There are many more things in this category. The real point of sequestration was to keep everyone focused on the Big Thing: how to get growth, deficit reduction, and fairness from a divided government in a time of scarcity. That's still the point, which means if we want to make progress, we shouldn't talk about sequestration--we should talk about the solutions for slaying the monster. We know that averting sequestration was always the important point because it was built into sequestration agreement itself. When the monster was taken off the chain, lawmakers formed a Committee To Stay Focused and called it the ""supercommittee."" It was supposed to come up with something--anything--that would keep the monster at bay. The committee was made up of stout fellows who had demonstrated in tests of strength and cable-show appearances that they could stay focused. Alas, the Committee To Stay Focused did not stay focused. It failed to come up with an alternative to sequestration, but that didn't change the task: how to avoid the monster through an agreement. Given that this remains the task at this hour, it is dire indeed that a new debate has erupted over the makeup of the monster. That's what this recent fight about whether taxes were ever a part of sequestration is about. Over the weekend, Republicans, citing legendary reporter Bob Woodward's reporting, argued that taxes were never supposed to be a part of sequestration. The president is ""moving the goal posts"" by talking about taxes. Democrats are trying very hard to prove that Republicans and Bob Woodward are wrong. It's an argument they don't need to win, and if we want to stay focused, we don't need to engage in the argument either. The fight is irrelevant: Determining whether taxes were a part of sequestration is like arguing how many arms the monster has--and it has nothing to do with the Big Thing. Were tax increases among the things that were considered as a part of the plan to avoid the monster? Yes. The sequestration replacement could be about taxes, spending, or magic beans. Various Republicans and Democrats suggested various alternatives that included taxes. Most Republicans objected to including taxes as a part of the sequestration replacement, which is exactly what they were supposed to do. They were supposed to have a philosophical disagreement focused on the Big Thing. We should get back to that quickly--before the monster arrives."

19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/02/chuck_hagel_secretary_of_defense_nomination_why_do_senators_still_send_letters.html	"On Wednesday afternoon, the office of Sen. Lindsey Graham released a letter that had just been sent to secretary of defense nominee Chuck Hagel. ""I want to call your attention to and request a response to a story in the Washington Free Beacon on February 19th,"" wrote Graham. He cut and pasted two paragraphs from the story, about an attendee at a 2010 Hagel speech, and his accusation that the future nominee ""basically said that Israel has violated every UN resolution since 1967."" Nobody had found a recording to back up the accusation, but Graham took to his keyboard and pounced. ""Senator Hagel, did you say this?"" wrote Graham. ""Have you said anything similar?"" It had been only five days since the last letter from Graham to Hagel, asking about another Free Beacon story regarding another speech. Hagel had sent Graham his own letter, denying the accusation. Graham described the letter on TV, before a diligent Fox News reporter snagged a copy. This raises two questions. One: Will Hagel respond to the final few days of ""What about your gaffes""-style accusations by being more transparent? Two: Why do senators send formal letters whenever they need to ask a question? Couldn't they could just pick up the phone or send emails or thumb-type Twitter DMs? Why don't they? You might assume some formal reason from the Senate rulebook, but you'd be wrong. Nothing in the House's or the Senate's rules specifies any situation where a question or answer has to be submitted in the form of a printed letter. ""It's old school politics,"" says Jim Manley, a former spokesman for Nevada Sen. Harry Reid. ""You get to satisfy any concerns about collegiality by giving a colleague or a nominee a heads up before giving the letter. You're not ambushing him. You're giving him time before releasing this to press."" It works like this. Any letter to members or a nominee is drafted, approved, and printed. A human being has to deliver the letter. ""Either you find a willing intern who wants to play a role in history, or you give the job to a staff assistant,"" says Manley. The courier has to confirm receipt by the addressee or his/her secretary. (The Graham letters to Hagel have been delivered to his office at Georgetown University.) When the courier returns to the office, and confirms delivery, the member of Congress can start blabbing to the press and releasing the text of what was sent. He doesn't need to wait for the addressee to actually read the thing. He just needs to say that it got to his desk. Decades ago, this worked like a dream for the letter writer and his target, a way to trade information or accusations quickly and for posterity. Now, when the text of the letter can be PDF'd and pasted online, it carries a whiff of passive aggression--it's more like a subpoena than a normal ""hey, would you check this out?"" question. Two weeks ago, freshman Texas Sen. Ted Cruz let it be known that he was gathering signatures on a letter to Michigan Sen. Carl Levin, and that this letter would ask for a delay in the Armed Services committee's vote on Chuck Hagel. Cruz then released the letter to the Washington Post's somewhat Hagel-skeptical blogger Jennifer Rubin. And then, instead of immediately responding, Levin composed a long letter explaining to the committee's ranking member, James Inhofe, that senators ""cannot have two different sets of financial disclosure standards for nominees."" If this looked like grandstanding, good eye: It was. ""When you're sending an official letter you're killing two birds with one stone,"" says Manley. ""You're not ambushing your colleague, but you're not giving the recipient the chance to shape the message in his own direction, either. It's far too easy to dream up a press strategy that involves writing a letter and quickly releasing it to reporters, making the recipient look pressured. There are strategists who spend whole days thinking of stuff like this."" And so a token of congressional collegiality, a tradition from the days of wigs and quills, has taken on the feel of a subpoena. It bestows the sender with clout he couldn't get with a mere phone call or cable news appearance. Case in point: Today, a spokesman for Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby said the senator would vote to confirm Chuck Hagel ""barring any unforeseen surprises."" That was quickly chased out of the headlines by the news that Texas Sen. John Cornyn was asking senators to sign a letter that ""formally asks"" the White House to dump Hagel. What gives that letter more heft than Cornyn's previous press releases, which also asked the White House to dump Hagel? Nothing. But it sounds important, and it gives the courier something to do on a slow Thursday."	Why Do Senators Still Send Letters To Attack Their Political Enemies?

For the National Rifle Association's CEO, that dystopia--or more specifically, the fear that it conjures--is the stuff that grows membership, funding, and influence. And for much of his 22-year tenure leading the NRA, he has conjured those fears with the help of a familiar enemy: the U.S. government. The NRA has long argued that American citizens needed to be armed to fend off some future American dictatorship that would one day ""come for the guns."" Charlton Heston wasn't subtle in his ""cold dead hands"" pledge in 2000. In 1995, LaPierre called federal employees ""jack-booted government thugs"" and claimed that they were ""wearing Nazi bucket helmets and black storm trooper uniforms to attack law-abiding citizens."" Or, if it wasn't Uncle Sam knocking down doors, it would be some other totalitarian government. While most of us saw Red Dawn as a cheap action flick, LaPierre saw a possible future, saying there ""was nothing unrealistic in that dramatization"" of Cubans seizing our guns. ""It can happen here,"" he warned. But that is yesterday's dystopia. In a sense, LaPierre's argument fell victim to the NRA's own success. It's hard to argue that the federal government is coming to seize your guns when that same government is working overtime to enshrine the power of the Second Amendment. During the Bush administration, Attorney General John Ashcroft pushed for an expanded interpretation of the Second Amendment, and the White House helped push through special protections for the gun industry. As George W. Bush's administration furthered an ardent pro-gun agenda in sync with the NRA's position, LaPierre had to find a new strategy. So today, LaPierre isn't spending so much time warning of an overweening, tyrannical federal government; he is more interested in social collapse. The shift can be dated to late 2005, specifically the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. In the 1990s, LaPierre had noted the role ""armed citizens played in stabilizing a community against the crime and looting that followed in the wake of Hurricane Andrew that same year."" But it was subtheme, never a drumbeat. After all, with President Clinton pushing for monumental gun violence laws, including the Assault Weapons Ban and the Brady Bill, LaPierre's specter of federal government had some purchase. After Katrina, the ""fear of social collapse"" argument moved to center stage. A pamphlet invoked Katrina to warn that you can be ""reduced to the final and purest form of self-reliance in the face of terrifying anarchy."" The dystopia LaPierre has been peddling since then is less an all-powerful U.S. government than a government that is helpless to protect you. LaPierre's pivot was on full display in an article he wrote last week for the Daily Caller. After describing the ""hellish world"" left in Hurricane Sandy's wake, he goes on to catalog his fears: ""Hurricanes. Tornadoes. Riots. Terrorists. Gangs. Lone Criminals. These are perils we are sure to face--not just maybe."" But the full conversion comes five paragraphs later, when he writes: ""Gun owners are not buying firearms because they anticipate a confrontation with the government. Rather, we anticipate confrontations where the government isn't there--or simply doesn't show up in time."" Forget totalitarianism. Now we need to fear total anarchy. Of course, LaPierre has a fully loaded plan. His 2011 book, Safe: How To Protect Yourself, Your Family, and Your Home, was reviewed by Publishers Weekly as a ""useful addition to anyone's Go Bag."" Moving away from a focus on its own merchandise, in 2011 the NRA began selling an entire line of ""Survivor Gear"" designed to equip you for catastrophe. For $139.95 you can buy an NRA machete designed to give you ""force for chopping and a naturally relaxed wrist position for thrusting."" In keeping with the ""prepper"" craze, the NRA is trying to position itself as preparing citizens for catastrophes when you cannot rely on government. Even after the Newtown, Conn., school shooting, LaPierre doubled down on his disaster preparedness message. In a little-noticed line from his initial news conference after Newtown, he warned that a ""hurricane, terrorist attack, or some other natural or man-made disaster"" could set the stage ""for a national nightmare of violence and victimization."" At his testimony at the Senate Judiciary Committee in January, he distanced himself from his older anti-government line and argued that guns are ""relevant and essential to ""fundamental human survival"" because ""if a tornado hits, a hurricane hits, if a riot occurs"" then people ""are going to be out there alone, and the only way they are going to protect themselves in the cold, in the dark, is with a firearm."" In the end, LaPierre doesn't really care which dystopia he is selling. Until Congress appears poised to pass gun-control legislation with even a hint of seriousness, LaPierre will still be looking on the horizon for the next storm front that will return us to a lawless state of nature. A few years ago he had the same fervor when he hyped fears that the Holocaust could happen in the United States. Regardless of the apocalyptic scenario, LaPierre always has the same answer: more guns."	Why Wayne LaPierre Loves Hurricanes and Natural Disasters	['Clinton']	['guns']
21	21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/02/_conservative_media_outlets_like_the_daily_caller_and_the_washington_free.html	"The Daily Caller, Tucker Carlson's full-service politics magazine, just celebrated three years in business. The Washington Free Beacon, founded by comrades and scions from The Weekly Standard, just turned one. Thanks to them, two administration allies--Sen. Bob Menendez and former Sen. Chuck Hagel--have added that terrifying Washington word, embattled, to their business cards.* Matthew Continetti, the editor of the Free Beacon, said so in his weekly column for the site. Politico's media reporter, Dylan Byers, had heaped scorn on the Free Beacon for dogging the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee for 990 tax forms and a 2008 tape of a Chuck Hagel speech. The tape, once discovered, was a snoozer. But the Free Beacon's reporting had pulled it loose, along with the 990s. And the Free Beacon and the Daily Caller had been asking questions about Menendez's Bill-and-Ted relationship with Salomon Melgen, a wealthy eye doctor who traded trips to the Dominican Republic for a little senatorial clout in his negotiations over a lucrative port deal. ""When Chuck Hagel withdraws his nomination,"" wrote Continetti, ""and Bob Menendez resigns his Senate seat, the usual suspects will bemoan the state of affairs that have allowed horrible conservatives to besmirch the reputations of such honorable and decent men. The usual suspects, of course, will have missed the real lesson: reporting works."" The national Republican Party is splintered, angry, and captivated by infighting. Fox News is putting up surprisingly weak ratings. But the conservative new media is having a great second term. Three sources--the Weekly Standard's blog, the Free Beacon, and Jennifer Rubin's Right Turn blog at the Washington Post--have outpaced the media in leaks and memos from Senate Republicans and revelations from old Hagel speeches. I discovered that firsthand when I couldn't find a long Hagel quote cited in a Republican memo but absent in the book it was sourced to. In no time at all, the Free Beacon's industrious Adam Kredo produced the evidence--a long tape that the book's author hadn't used. The anti-Hagel universe is small, and despite what Continetti writes, it's not likely to get a withdrawal from a nominee with 60-odd commitments for a cloture vote. But we're talking about a cloture vote, aren't we? It's also become public knowledge, from New Jersey Democratic dinners all the way up to Jay Leno, that Sen. Bob Menendez is being investigated ""for allegedly soliciting Dominican prostitutes."" In November, when the Daily Caller published that story, the rest of the media ignored it, and New Jersey politicos knew that a rumor that hadn't been confirmed by other news outlets had found purchase somewhere less reputable. ""When it was that weird Daily Caller video,"" said Buzzfeed's Ruby Cramer, ""it was whatever."" And no other outlet has confirmed it. The FBI raided Melgen's office, which kicked off a series of investigative stories on his financial ties to Menendez. Almost immediately, the prostitution allegation was conflated with the financial investigation. Other media, chasing the prostitution story, have totally failed to find the sources. The Washington Post, most hilariously, sent a reporter down to the alleged sex scene and got back a (well-crafted!) travel piece. Menendez and Hagel tried to ignore this stuff, until they couldn't. Why couldn't they? Former Slatester Mickey Kaus coined and honed the term ""undernews"" to describe ""stories bubbling up from the blogs and the tabs that don't meet MSM standards."" Every time a gif is born, it becomes harder for the ""mainstream media"" to sift out what its readers know--and what its reporters know. In October 2012, when the Daily Caller ran its first Menendez story, political reporters stayed up and tweeted in anticipation of a damaging-looking story previewed on the Drudge Report. No matter how much Drudge gets wrong, whatever runs there surfaces in the ""undernews."" Only after they get an excuse, like the FBI cracking into Melgen's office, do reporters admit that they knew about this, and start lobbing questions. It's all very entertaining for Matthew Boyle, who ran the first Menendez story at the Daily Caller and now reports for Breitbart.com. ""How many times does this have to happen before the old media catches on?"" he asks. ""If this story broke in the New York Times, people in the old media would have covered it. If it was about a Republican they would have run it. There's a gutless factor in the media and a double standard when it comes to Democrats versus Republicans. They don't have any balls."" But it's not that simple. From 2004 to 2011, gay rights activist Mike Rogers ran BlogActive, a site that (among other things) ""outed"" Republicans who voted the wrong way. He got scoops, scaring Virginia Rep. Ed Schrock into retirement with tapes of his escort service calls, but the media didn't chase most of his stories. Oct. 17, 2006, weeks before the midterm demolition of the GOP, Rogers ran an item ""call[ing] on Senator Larry Craig to end his years of hypocrisy by leveling with Idahoans about who he really is."" Rogers claimed to have traveled from D.C. ""to the Pacific Northwest to meet with men who say they have physical relations with the Senator."" Eight months later, Craig tapped his foot in the bathroom of a Minneapolis airport and got arrested for soliciting gay sex. All of a sudden the Post was calling Rogers the ""most feared man in Washington,"" a man who cold-called congressional offices and asked, ""Are you gay?"" The media's standards kept them from pursuing a story. Is that what's happened to Hagel and Menendez? Again, it's not as clear as Continetti makes it sound. ""Our reporting on Hagel hasn't come up empty,"" he writes. ""Not one bit."" That blows right past a Free Beacon story from December about how Hagel ""may no longer be President Obama's favored pick to run the Defense Department"" and how the cowed administration was moving on. Some of the juiciest stories in conservative new media have speculated on what might be contained in the information Hagel (or Menendez) won't release. This sort of reporting-by-reduction probably peaked when Breitbart.com speculated on a possible donation to a Hagel group by ""Friends of Hamas,"" a group that does not actually exist. But this reporting has an occasional ally: Senate Republicans. In the Jan. 31 Hagel hearing, Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe cited a slam on the nominee that came from Jennifer Rubin's reported blog. In his own questions, which have quickly made him the media's least favorite Republican, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has asked Hagel to prove that he doesn't have unreported funding from foreign creeps. ""It is at a minimum relevant to know,"" he said, ""if that $200,000 that he deposited in his bank account came directly from Saudi Arabia, came directly from North Korea."" The last best hope of beating Hagel is that in the next 11 days these sorts of questions and allegations will turn up something--a ""bombshell,"" South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham calls it--that sinks him. On Thursday, as the cloture vote on Hagel narrowly failed, Free Beacon reporter Alana Goodman reported on a 2007 speech Hagel (then a senator and potential presidential candidate) gave at Rutgers. According to George Ajjan, a Hagel admirer, the nominee had said something about the State Department working as an adjunct of the Israeli Foreign Minister's office. It was a paraphrase, and no tape or transcript was available, but Goodman got Ajjan to confirm the gist. Twenty-four hours later, Graham and New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte sent an open letter to the nominee. ""Yesterday,"" they wrote, ""the Washington Free Beacon reported that in a 2007 speech at Rutgers University regarding America's relationship with the Middle East you remarked that 'the State Department was becoming an adjunct of the Israeli Foreign Ministry.' Given the importance of U.S. policy towards the Middle East and the Secretary of Defense's direct role in implementing this policy, it is critical that we have a better understanding of your remarks before we vote on your confirmation."" News of this letter first broke in the Weekly Standard. Correction, Feb. 17, 2013: This article originally misidentified Chuck Hagel as a Democrat. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"

22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/02/what_marco_rubio_could_actually_learn_from_mitt_romney_if_he_wants_to_lead.html	"What's worse for your political ambitions, being labeled a wimp by Newsweek or a savior by Time? Marco Rubio, the freshman senator from Florida, has been stuck with the savior label and it has several disadvantages. It makes allies suspicious, irritates your rivals, and perhaps worst of all: When you're a savior, people expect you to perform miracles. After Rubio delivered the Republican response to President Obama's State of the Union Address, commentators said he had simply mouthed standard GOP talking points. How was he going to expand the Republican electorate by doing that? A particularly damning charge was that he sounded too much like Mitt Romney. As Jonathan Martin pointed out, Rubio's speech--thick with references to his humble origins and common touch--was designed to send the signal that he was the polar opposite of Mitt Romney. The story of Rubio, his ambitions, and how they play out is about more than just the fortunes of one charismatic Republican. Rubio is one of the architects of the Republican future. Like Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Rep. Paul Ryan, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, his ambitions are linked to his party in a way that is different than figures with greater power like John Boehner and Mitch McConnell. Every day Rubio is taking soundings about what the GOP will allow and what the larger electorate will allow. The risks he takes and the reactions they provoke from his fellow-travelers will tell us something about where the party is headed. Still, the criticism of Rubio's State of the Union response asks too much too soon. The GOP is not ready to announce a sweeping new direction, (it may never be ready) and Rubio isn't in a position to launch a thorough rebranding right now anyway. Even if he was, 10 minutes after the State of the Union would be the wrong time to do it. Still, if Rubio is going to add new energy to the GOP, he'll have to find a venue where he can make a much more compelling case for the party's signature principle: the promise and glory of smaller government. For many conservatives, the criticism of Rubio's message on Tuesday night  is meaningless. The media apply labels in part to then remove them. So build up Rubio and then take him down. It's meaningless for another reason too: They don't think the party needs much tinkering. So when Rubio reads from the traditional GOP script it sounds good to them. Rubio and his team care about this parlor game though. The senator tweeted out a response to the Time cover: ""There is only one savior, and it's not me. #Jesus."" Rubio cares because he buys into the notion that the Republican Party needs to change and he wants to be the voice to lead that change. But a freshman senator can't just determine what the new direction of the party should be. Smart substance is helpful to the GOP--that is the type of differentiation they need right now, especially when the president's State of the Union message is the equivalent of an only child's Christmas list. But Rubio and his party aren't there yet. The precise amplitude of that new change is still being triangulated--by both Rubio and other Republicans like House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. Whoever the transformational figure is, he or she is going to have to build a bridge between the old and the new. That requires at least two tasks: challenging orthodoxy and giving special voice to it. If you can sing the song of American exceptionalism and free enterprise in a way that pleases your party base, then you can push the envelope on immigration without fear of being called a RINO or consorting with Karl Rove. Rubio's task Tuesday night was to sing the Republican anthem. It was a time for team spirit. The party was going up against Obama. The script was pre-written. Plus, Rubio is already clashing with conservatives over his immigration reform plans. To the extent he has other provocative ideas (and he may not), it doesn't make sense to create more tumult while you're trying to make rocky progress on immigration. But here's where Rubio has work to do. His address wasn't that thrilling on the signature question at issue: the size of government. It was, like Mitt Romney's entire campaign, a list of assertions rather than a compelling case about how the middle class benefits from smaller government. There are also policy critiques about Rubio's vision of smaller government (critics say he was wrong about private investment, the cause of the housing crisis, and other issues), but let's leave aside policy for the moment. There is one thing that Republicans of any incarnation past or present are going to put at the center of their platform: Smaller is better. Whoever can make the best case for that essential principle wins the day. Rubio's case wasn't that nearly savior-worthy. It affirmed the bounties of the free market, but he spent most of the time explaining why Obama's big government was bad. An amazing story about the wonders that would flow from smaller government would be more appealing and persuasive. Bromides about unleashing sectors and removing regulations are tired and threadbare. For conservatives, progress flows naturally from smaller government; you don't have to do a lot of explaining at the Lincoln Day dinners, but Rubio and his party have to do more than convince conservatives. There are people who might distrust government but also rely on it, and there are those who worry that when the government shrinks they won't share in the new arrangement. Arguments about how big government is bad don't speak to those fears. There's also perhaps a lesson Rubio can take from something Mitt Romney did well. For much of the campaign, Romney portrayed Obama as a guy who cared and was trying to do the right thing but who was just in over his head. The Romney campaign didn't want to spook those voters who had backed Obama in 2008 but were having second thoughts. No reason to make them feel bad or defensive about their initial decision. But there was another benefit to this approach; it kept the focus on a clash of policies. It suggested you wanted to help the middle class as much as the bleeding heart liberal, you just had a different way of doing it. It also undermined the idea that the GOP attack was driven by bitterness, a siege mentality, or pique. Romney was never able to convey this shared concern for the middle class, but a senator who lives in the same working-class neighborhood he grew up in probably could. Finally, there is Rubio's aqua lunge, as Politico's Martin put it. While it was natural for some performance conservatives to get into a righteous wind about the Twitter traffic making sport of Rubio's awkward pause to take a drink of water, Rubio was smarter than that. He didn't turn water into whine, complaining that people were making too much of his emergency gulp. He made sport of the episode, which allowed him to show humility, good spirit, and his light-on-his-feet instincts. It's a small thing, but those were never words applied to Mitt Romney. That's a start."	What Mitt Romney Can Teach Marco Rubio	['Paul', 'Romney', 'Rubio', 'McConnell', 'Obama']	[]
23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/02/barack_obama_s_state_of_the_union_address_the_president_brought_a_lot_of.html	"The president's State of the Union address was more than 6,000 words, but its message to voters could fit inside a single tweet: I am full of ideas that will directly affect your life, but these people in the audience are blocking them. The president brought a ton of proposals on Tuesday night: universal preschool, tax reform, immigration reform, a minimum wage increase, a cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions, infrastructure investments, new housing incentives, manufacturing incentives, energy plans, a program for scoring college education by affordability, and paycheck equity. They all seemed to have ready-made hashtags: #manufacturinghub, #fixitfirst, and #collegescorecard. There was no moon shot or a plan for overhauling Social Security, but in the aggregate it was a lot, especially in the current environment where the Senate can't pass a budget, House conservatives are ready to burn the ships, and Barack Obama and John Boehner openly question the other's toughness. How is the president going to get any of that done? Through creating outside pressure, his aides say. The State of the Union is a tough vehicle. The Constitution requires that the president report on the health of the nation, but the address is really an ensemble performance in which he and the audience act out the reasons it's so hard for them to get anything done. To illustrate mindless partisanship, members of each party clapped or didn't clap for different lines and phrases. Together they applauded only the most harmless notions like patriotism and the first lady, revealing how little they agree on. The president offered repeated rhetorical pitches that seemed utterly disconnected from reality. ""We can get this done,"" Obama said several times, as if all the old partisan arguments would melt away in the face of his new assurance. It's not going to happen. If only a president could break through the encrusted pageant and deliver one true thing. But apparently the Constitution has another rule: Don't do anything risky or interesting with the form. President Obama gave a thoroughly conventional presentation on Tuesday night. It was another way in which the speech matched the moment. By not breaking through the format of the speech, the president reminds us how hard it is to break through the constraints that restrict governing. That puts into perspective the president's larger gambit of trying to sell these plans he unveiled to the country. Can he deliver a message through the clot of partisanship, mistrust, sclerosis, and fatigue that will actually motivate people? The president built his speech around using government to create ""a rising, thriving middle class,"" which he said will help shrink the budget deficit through creating economic growth. That growth will come through investment from the programs he was suggesting. He had a suggestion for every stage of life from nearly cradle to grave, starting with universal pre-school, secondary education, and college assistance all the way through the earning years to retirement when retirees will need a retooled Medicare. In a familiar construction, the president positioned himself as the guardian of Medicare, though he did reiterate support for modest Medicare reforms in order to achieve his goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction. The president was offering a precision list in a time of blunt budget math. The ""sequester,"" the across-the-board budget cuts, are coming in two weeks. President Obama and the Republicans don't look much closer to finding a solution to at least making the cuts smarter. This is the seemingly insurmountable obstacle standing between Obama's vision of investment-led growth and a drastic dose of austerity. If those cuts do come, Obama said they would still be better than the Republican plan to avert the sequester, which he said would lead to cuts in education, job training, Medicare, Social Security, and other programs that would devastate the middle class. So how does this get worked out? When you frame the debate with Republicans like that--reckless cuts vs. smart investments--you're not looking to make friends. The president was not outwardly aggressive toward Republicans, but the speech did further confirm what appeared obvious before his second term began: Aggression is to be expected given his ambition, posture, selection of issues, and disdain for the leadership of the Republican Party. The president and his aides have already gotten good bio-feedback from this early posture. Obama won the debt limit and fiscal cliff fights pushing Republicans off of their anti-tax position. The president and his aides are mounting this strategy once again, hoping Republicans will drop their stance that the across the board cuts be replaced with other domestic spending cuts but no revenue from taxes. The president's speech had new elements but sounded thoroughly familiar to anyone who has been listening for the last several years. ""Let me repeat--nothing I'm proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime,"" Obama told a joint session of Congress. ""It's not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth."" To Republicans the dime promise is a laugh line. Money that pays for new programs could go to cut the deficit caused by spending on the old ones. (It's also a line he used when talking about health care spending in 2009) When Republicans hear the word ""invest"" they think spend. There is still a fundamental philosophical debate at the heart of American government: The president is arguing for more government and Republicans are arguing for much less. The president ended his speech on a powerful note, telling the stories of the heroes and victims of gun violence. ""They deserve a vote,"" he said of legislation aimed at limiting the mayhem. ""Gabby Giffords deserves a vote!"" ""The families of Newtown deserve a vote!"" ""The families of Aurora deserve a vote!"" The crowd joined the call, responding to the mix of loss and bravery. It was the kind of swell of emotion that could lead to change after years of resistance.  After nearly an hour of the traditional fare, it was like an entirely different speech. Too bad he felt like he needed the other 5,500 words."	Obama's Speech Had One Simple Message: Blame Republicans!	['Obama']	[]

25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/02/rove_s_conservative_victory_project_the_republican_strategist_s_bold_campaign.html	"When Karl Rove's critics--his conservative critics--learned of his new effort to shape Republican politics, the hashtag #crushrove popped up on Twitter. Rove's intraparty foes insisted that his Conservative Victory Project be stopped: It was an effort to sideline the Tea Party, protect incumbents, and bleach conservatism out of the GOP. But Rove's critics are wrong. If the Republican Party wants to evolve and the Tea Party wants a place in it, don't #crushrove, #hugrove. Almost everyone connected to the GOP has opined recently about how the Republican Party needs to evolve after the 2012 election defeats. Gov. Bobby Jindal has given speeches, Rep. Paul Ryan has offered views, and this week House Majority Leader Eric Cantor invited everyone down to AEI to offer a few thin policy proposals aimed at rebranding. This paddling around in the shallow end is fine, but if there's going to be transformation, the Republican Party needs leadership and clear choices. Rove is offering both. The other would-be visionaries are playing it safe, but Rove has joined Sen. Marco Rubio in actually putting action behind the talk. The idea of the Victory Project is that Rove and his allies will pick sides in Republican primary campaigns, supporting candidates who can win in the general election. This idea has infuriated many conservatives, and prompted an outpouring of ridicule. ""In 2012, they spent hundreds of millions of rich donors' money and had jack to show for it,"" wrote RedState's Erik Erickson. Town Hall's  Terry Jeffrey cataloged every conservative sin of the Bush administration in a piece titled ""Karl Rove is Not a Conservative."" . Influential conservative radio host Mark Levin referred to him as ""doughboy"" and levied a series of charming attacks, including a critique of Rove's penmanship. Rove says he has been badly misunderstood (I know the feeling). He's not trying to protect incumbents, he says, but to make sure that the best conservatives can get elected. He points out that his 2012 Crossroads Super-PAC supported lots of Tea Party candidates. This hasn't calmed the anti-Rove fury. Many groups are interested in hyping the idea of a civil war between Karl Rove and the GOP. The press loves a catfight, and when Donald Trump calls Karl Rove a ""total loser"" it's going to get covered. Movement conservatives raise money by turning Karl Rove into a bogeyman. And Rove raises money, too, because the attention attracts donors who want to see the irrational grass-roots neutralized. Acts of performance umbrage may start taking place on the mall. I just got one such solicitation from a Rove critic, an email from Tea Party favorite Christine O'Donnell, the 2010 failed GOP senate candidate from Delaware, who was raising money off of the Rove outrage. (You remember O'Donnell as the candidate who had to deny that she was a witch.) Hers was a race of just the type Rove is trying to shape. Had Mike Castle been the GOP nominee, he'd probably be Sen. Castle right now. Rove believes that candidates like O'Donnell gave away likely seats in Nevada, Colorado, Indiana, and Missouri during the last two election cycles. The GOP might control the Senate today if sharper candidates had prevailed. This line of thinking outrages movement conservatives and Tea Party activists. They chalk up the defeats to the liberal media, which lampooned true conservatives by fixating on their minor missteps. By pledging to support more electable candidates, Rove is buying in to the frame that the media puts around true conservatives. This theory may be reasonable or it may be poppycock. Either way, Rove's detractors should thank him for bringing the debate into the open. Rove's new effort is good for the Tea Party in the way that doubters are good for religions. No faith worthy of its Sunday parishioners crumbles under a challenge. Leaving aside whether Rove is really challenging the core of Tea Party beliefs, his efforts force those who hold a different view into being clearer about what they believe. Only if they go through that process can they make their case to Republicans who aren't already true believers. Plus, if they can't beat Karl Rove at the internal game, they're not going to be able to beat the Democrats."

Like many single politicians, and even some who are married, rumors of sexual indiscretions have swirled for a while among his staff. In the media, most papers are now delicately mentioning that he is the former political boss of Hudson County, an area of Jersey known for its ""rough and tumble"" politics. (For those new to Jersey politics, ""rough and tumble"" is cocktail-hour code for corrupt.) So far the Menendez flap is following a well-trod path of politicians accused of shedding clothing and common sense: sex allegations that at first blush seem outrageous, followed by denials from the press secretary and other senior staff; outraged calls by ""nonpartisan"" government groups for punishment or resignation; and a growing media push for either an admission or categorical refutation. Forgotten in all the back and forth are the dozens of staffers working behind the scenes to prop up their boss and make him look politically viable during the storm. For these sorry souls, the experience--the crisis--is professionally and personally consuming. Congressional staffers are not like most of us. They become personally attached to their bosses in ways that few regular office workers understand. If dog owners actually do resemble their pets, then staffers take it one step further, sometimes morphing into caricatures of their employer, mimicking everything from speech patterns to habits of thought. But when scandal hits a congressional office, staffers suddenly realize they really aren't like the boss at all. They remain loyal to the office, but if the man behind the desk starts looking guilty or evasive, things can get stressful and alarming in the office pretty quickly. It's not just hurt feelings--staffers' careers can end if they hang onto a sinking ship for too long. I'm not in the Menendez office, but I spent more than three years working in the Senate, and I'm now working on a book about staff on Capitol Hill and have interviewed nearly 100 of them. Here's what they say it feels like when the scandal hits. Expect to be the last to know. Just about every staffer on the Hill has a small desk TV tuned to Fox News or MSNBC. When the scandal makes landfall, the only way staff know what's happening is by watching the news. People who don't work in Congress often think staffers have the inside line on the lurid details or what's coming next. In fact, no senator invites his staff into his personal office for a group huddle to discuss his alleged sex problems. When a scandal hits, members almost universally go into lockdown. Only the inner circle, such as the chief of staff or a longtime adviser, is tapped for advice, whether to plan a PR strategy or the mechanics of a graceful exit. The rest of the staff are reading the generic talking points they've been handed (which say nothing and have already been reported), scanning Google for new details, and watching TV for the latest gossip. At no point is there a moment of clarity, unless it's too late to matter. Answering the phones just got worse. There is no job on Capitol Hill as awful as answering the phones. Front-office staffers usually start right out of college taking calls, greeting guests, and fielding walk-ins. On any given day, they handle dozens of calls from voters whose lives revolve around watching cable news and then phoning Congress to scream about the downfall of America. With a sex scandal, however, your daily phone battles suddenly go nuclear. Not just the number but the intensity of the calls will reach mushroom-cloud levels. Expect to be cursed out more often by voters who formerly questioned if you are an ""idiot."" Now you've got someone on the line yelling that he or she always knew your boss was a ""corrupt fucking asshole!"" And then there are the reporters with cameras camped outside the front office, pointlessly waiting to get a quick shot of the senator. It's amazing that the TV people still haven't learned that every senator has a secret, unmarked exit one floor above or below the main office. Imagine you're six months out of college, working a job that pays very little and carrying a pile of student debt. Now you're scared you might lose your job if your boss is asked to resign, making you unable to pay rent on that crappy room you found in a group house in Petworth. This is the reality for the lower tier of people working for Menendez. The only consolation is that they're not alone. The scandal staff fraternity has been around as long as Congress has had staff. Resumes are circulating. Menendez staffers are still working on bills. They're still attending meetings with federal agencies. They're still taking those phone calls. But some of them--the smart ones at least--are quietly putting out feelers, making careful inquiries about openings with other members. They need to maintain a front of absolute trust in the guy at the top, but if Menendez is following the pattern, he's probably not telling them anything. Trust nobody, especially people in your own party. A senator or representative is never weaker than when his alleged sexual improprieties are being batted about on cable news. In some cases, this is the perfect opportunity for his colleagues to stab him in the back. That committee chair he holds? The guy one rung below in the pecking order would love that seat. He may have already made some quiet inquires with party leaders asking who might be at the top of the list for a replacement. Then there are the petty party chieftains back home, licking their chops for a shot at a seat that wasn't supposed to open up for years. Some of the only people who don't see an upside to this mess are staffers from the opposite party whose own bosses work with the soon-to-be-toppled lawmaker on specific issues. At a human level, they have nothing to gain from the scandal--especially if it's a safe seat that won't change party hands. They just feel sorry for their counterparts, and their bosses are about to lose a rare ally from across the aisle. Scandal makes for strange bedfellows. Other staffers feel sympathy. But they are also laughing. When scandal hits, most other staff feel a natural sympathy for what their colleagues are going through. Everyone knows they are just one embarrassing indiscretion away from the same nightmare. Still, people like to have a little fun. This is sex we're talking about, so people naturally can't help but gawk and giggle. A few years back, then-Sen. John Ensign got hit with his own sex scandal. You might remember Ensign from the time his name was being floated for a possible run for the White House because he ""looked presidential."" That ended when the media reported that his office duties included sleeping with a member of his staff, who was also a close family friend, best friend to his wife, and married to another person in his office who was also a friend of the family. The story broke on a Tuesday in June 2009. I watched a colleague call Ensign's front desk that afternoon. No answer. When he called back a few hours later, Ensign's voice mail had been flooded and wasn't taking any more messages. I walked by Ensign's office and found the doors locked. The whole office had shut down. Two days later, I was back at my colleague's desk as he placed another call to Ensign's front office. Several staffers gathered around, all cracking up as we imagined the poor sap on the other end of the line. ""Hello? Is everything OK?"" my colleague asked, trying to keep his composure. ""I've been trying to get a hold of you guys for several days."" Pause. ""Nobody was answering the phones. What's going on?"" Sens. Ensign and Larry Craig were felled by sex scandals, but Sen. David Vitter survived his. What staff working for Menendez are looking out for now is any sign that the Democratic Senate leadership is abandoning their boss, tossing him overboard for the good of the party. That or a prosecutor in some jurisdiction announcing subpoenas. At that point, the only person who will be talking for the senator will be his attorney."

What about your gaffes? It's the sure-thing applause line in Gov. Bobby Jindal's current speeches. ""We had a number of Republicans damage the brand this year with offensive and bizarre comments,"" said the Louisiana governor in front of party audiences last month. ""Enough of that!"" It's the theory behind the Conservative Victory Project, an as yet murky outgrowth of Karl Rove's American Crossroads. In a front page Sunday New York Times story, American Crossroads president Stephen J. Law said that Republicans had ""blown a significant number of races because the wrong candidates were selected."" Rep. Steve King, an Iowa conservative now thinking about a Senate race, might have to be mercy-smothered by super PAC cash, because ""all of the things he's said are going to be hung around his neck."" Who were the wrong candidates, the scrubs who cost Republicans the Senate? This is the list: Christine O'Donnell (Delaware), Ken Buck (Colorado), Sharron Angle (Nevada), Richard Mourdock (Indiana), and Todd Akin (Missouri). In two of these cases, in Indiana and Delaware, Republican elder statesmen who could have won easily were replaced with losers. In Delaware, in 2010, the Democrats lucked out when Christine O'Donnell advanced in the GOP primary. By 2011 the Democrats were actually recruiting a candidate in Indiana because they bet Sen. Richard Lugar, unbeatable in a general election, would be brought down in the primary. ""The damage has already been done,"" says former Delaware Rep. Mike Castle, the stem-cell-research-supporting, compromise-seeking candidate whose 44-year career was ended by O'Donnell. ""I'm not an insider when it comes to this new effort, but the goal seems to be to stem future damage. I think that's good."" But will it really be this easy? Law, who was Mitch McConnell's chief of staff before he entered the semi-private sector, talks as if the ""bad candidate"" problem is easy to detect and easy to burn out, and as if no one has tried it before. It has been tried before. In 2012, the American Action Network saw Lugar imploding and bought $600,000 worth of TV ads to try to save him, accusing Mourdock of benefiting from ""illegal tax breaks"" and other hypocrisies. It failed spectacularly, with the little-known state treasurer topping Lugar by 20 points. Those ads started late. The Conservative Victory Project, theoretically, would get the jump on the unelectables. But what makes a candidate unelectable? ""Electability,"" as conservatives know it, was the concept that delivered Republicans President Mitt Romney and President John McCain. American Crossroads has funded plenty of electable candidates. In 2012, it spent around $26.5 million to elect Republicans who were heartily supported by the party establishment. That meant $11.3 million in Virginia, $7.4 million in Wisconsin, $5 million in Montana, $1.8 million in North Dakota, and even $1.1 million in New Mexico, where America Crossroads co-founder Heather Wilson was busily losing an open Senate race. No Republican consultant has accused these candidates of gaffes. George Allen's campaign in Virginia was almost eerily gaffe-free. But most of these candidates ran behind Mitt Romney anyway. ""All these reasonable moderate voices that ran with establishment support lost,"" says Chris Chocola, the two-term Republican congressman who now runs the Club for Growth. ""The Club for Growth has gotten involved in seven election cycles, and Republicans have gone on to lose only two of those general elections--Nevada and Mourdock.* And, look, I'm from Indiana. Richard Mourdock had won statewide, twice. When he won those races, he didn't talk about social issues. He did once. It was a big mistake. There's no question: He blew it. He wasn't Todd Akin, but he had a Todd Akin moment."" The funny thing about Akin is that no side can really claim him. (Why would they want to?) The 2012 Missouri primary was a three-way race between Akin, businessman John Brunner, and former State Treasurer Sarah Steelman. ""Todd Akin is often called a Tea Party candidate,"" says Tea Party Express strategist Sal Russo, ""but we didn't support him in the primary. Steelman was our candidate."" In defeat, Steelman attacked the National Republican Senatorial Committee for tacitly backing Brunner, a ""Stepford Wives"" candidate, and suggested that ""the Republican Party should actually listen to what Sarah Palin has to say, instead of stiff-arming her."" That's not exactly the promise of the Conservative Victory Project. No, Akin's specific problem was speculating, based on disturbingly popular pseudoscience, that the stress caused by nonconsensual sex could ""shut down"" conception. He elevated a social issue, when Republicans realized social issues introduced the wrong way could only hurt the party. ""My view is Republicans will need to be a little more thoughtful in their approach to issues,"" says Mike Castle. ""They may vote the way they would have before, but be less vehement in how they talk about the issues."" So why do they talk that way? Akin, we know, actually believed it. Other Republicans feel pressure to prove their conservative bona fides, because they fear a challenge from someone who'll make them prove it. Former Rep. Steve LaTourette, who left Congress this year and took over the moderate Republican Main Street Coalition, watched Ohio State Treasurer Josh Mandel disprove years of hype and blow tens of millions of dollars in a failed bid for the Senate. (American Crossroads spent $6.4 million.) ""The campaign reflected the way someone afraid of a primary challenge might campaign,"" says LaTourette. ""He spent a lot of time talking about [fetal] personhood legislation, and that really isn't a big deal when it comes down to it."" But Mandel didn't start talking about ""personhood"" because he had a death wish. The issue arose, and was elevated, by Republican legislators and conservative activists. At the supply side of the Republican Party, at the base level and in the primary electorate, there's a greater and greater demand for conservative fealty. The early-money-for-moderates strategy doesn't get at the root of that. It doesn't even try to. In November 2012, in one of the first ""the GOP blew it in Senate races"" thumbsuckers, Wall Street Journal columnist Kim Strassel accused Republicans of ""dismal"" recruitment efforts, without identifying what had been dismal about them. She had special derision for Montana loser Rep. Denny Rehberg, ""whose first bet was to sell out his own party on Medicare reform with ads trashing Paul Ryan ... in a state where 55 percent of voters voted for Mr. Romney (and his Medicare reforms)."" Sadly, there's no proof that snuggling up with the Ryan budget could have helped Rehberg. In the Montana exit poll, voters who were most worried about health care went for Obama by a landslide, 70-28. This is probably why the would-be saviors, in their would-be donor pitches, offer no proof that Republicans can solve their problems if only they knock off the gaffes. It's called the Conservative Victory Project, not the Let Moderates Be Moderates Project. ""Politics is marketing,"" says Chris Chocola. ""You have to market your ideas in an appealing way.""

28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/01/gang_of_eight_immigration_reform_why_republicans_and_democrats_agreeing.html	"In Washington, when senators from the two parties arrive simultaneously at a microphone, you've got yourself a ""gang."" Threats of bipartisanship soon follow. White papers and frameworks are issued. The lifespan of a gang is well-documented: Its members rush through the marble halls of Congress, trailed by a clot of reporters. Then it's on to the green rooms before they become extinct. Yet, even in Washington, hope still triumphs over experience. So this week, members of the ""gang of eight"" came to the microphone pushing immigration reform, and the old folk tales of bipartisanship were once again in the news. Amateur meteorologists claim to have spotted other flickers of the bipartisan phenomena. President Obama and Republican leaders reached a deal on a three-month extension of the debt limit and a bill to aid the victims of Hurricane Sandy. These are not historic acts, but why not raise a glass in tribute if for no other reason than to break the monotony of having to constantly  raise a glass to drown our frustration. But let's not mistake this for genuine bipartisanship. Or, if this is the new standard for bipartisanship, then we should change our definition of it. These examples of ghost bipartisanship are born from pressure, not cooperation. Lawmakers aren't reasoning together; one side is crying uncle. That will almost certainly be true of any immigration reform measure that passes (if the reform effort doesn't break down under the weight of the partisanship itself). The folk story of bipartisanship goes like this: The two parties tackle a common problem, they fight like hell, but both sides ultimately give up something to get a deal. In 1983, Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill negotiated a compromise over Social Security. In 1990, George H.W. Bush forged a deal to reduce the deficit with Democratic leaders. In 1997, Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich hammered out a balanced budget agreement. These bipartisan moments were not simply the product of reason divorced from acrimony and politics. As President Truman said, ""There was never a nonpartisan in politics. A man cannot be a nonpartisan and be effective in a political party."" But today's droplets of bipartisanship are distinct from that tradition. They come not from shared sacrifice but from one side giving in. Charles Krauthammer says Republicans got rolled on the fiscal cliff talks. The Weekly Standard and Sen. Rand Paul say Republicans blinked on the debt limit fight. On the issue of immigration, the bipartisan opportunities exist not because wise men from both parties have decided to solve one of the nation's most pressing issues, but because Republicans are giving in to the pressure created by the last election. This fact is clear by the host of Republicans who once opposed or were skeptical of any immigration-reform package that included ""amnesty"" but who are now supporting it. It's not about policy; it's about politics. Similarly, on the question of gun control, there is an emerging consensus that Congress will support background checks for gun purchases. This too could be called bipartisanship, except that it's an emergency event brought on by the Newtown, Conn., massacre, which means it tells us nothing about the baseline health of bipartisanship. If recent cooperation shouldn't be confused with new bipartisan vigor, there's another new reason to be skeptical: history. Barack Obama's re-election marks only the second time that three consecutive presidents have served two consecutive four-year terms.* The last time was Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe. This gives us three modern examples of the presidential learning curve. After re-election, presidents of both parties draw the same conclusion: Bipartisanship is a pipe dream. In Bill Clinton's second inaugural address, he declared his election would bring about a new bipartisan era. ""The American people returned to office a president of one party and a Congress of another. Surely they did not do this to advance the politics of petty bickering and extreme partisanship they plainly deplore."" This was true long enough for the president to reach a budget deal with Republicans--just before his second term devolved into impeachment hearings. When Republicans pursued him for lying to a grand jury and obstructing justice, Clinton interpreted it as nothing more than blind partisanship. In 2004, after George W. Bush was re-elected, the man who once promised to unite and not divide entered his second term with a far dimmer view of compromise. ""I've got the will of the people at my back,"" he said despite his narrow victory. Bush's definition of bipartisanship meant other people falling in line: ""I'll reach out to everyone who shares our goals."" Bush later admitted that when giving his State of the Union address, he relished the partisan reaction it provoked. ""Sometimes I look through that teleprompter and see reactions. I'm not going to characterize what the reactions are, but nevertheless it causes me to want to lean a little more forward into the prompter, if you know what I mean. Maybe it's the mother in me."" Like Clinton, President Obama faces the prospect of hammering out deals with a divided government, but he reached the opposite conclusion. The president's aggressive second-term trajectory was evident even before he gave his inauguration speech, but the speech set the emotional tone for a second term full of conflicts. When Obama's top political adviser argues that Democrats don't have ""an opposition party worthy of the opportunity,"" it cemented the proof. There may be bipartisan progress in the months to come, but it will be of a tougher kind. Members of the two parties may join arms and make a deal, but it won't be the result of fellow feeling, conciliation, or understanding. If there's going to be gang-like behavior that achieves bipartisanship, it's more likely to come through a headlock than a hug.

And it was Hannity, two and a half months ago, who first told Republicans to take a dive on immigration and pass some kind of reform bill. ""We've got to get rid of the immigration issue altogether,"" he said on Nov. 8, two hard days after the re-election of Barack Obama. Not ""rid of immigration,"" but rid of ""the issue"" of immigration. The issue had scared 71 percent of Hispanic voters over to the president. ""I think you control the border first,"" said Hannity. ""You create a pathway for those people that are here--you don't say you've got to go home. And that is a position that I've evolved on."" That word--""evolved""--is conservative media code for sold out in the hopes of a brunch invite from Arianna Huffington. Ten years earlier, in his airbrushed jeremiad Let Freedom Ring (not on Kindle, but available for $0.01 before shipping), Hannity condemned the liberals who ""spuriously contend that opposing illegal immigration means opposing all immigration."" He printed the numbers of year-2000 immigrants from Iran and ""Afghanistan, then controlled by the Taliban,"" to make a point of some kind. Hannity's agita about immigrants was part terror-panic, part culture-panic. He wanted Republicans to win elections, and immigration made it harder. That could be proven by two sets of numbers. In 1980, when he defeated Jimmy Carter and destroyed the Democratic Party's national coalition, Ronald Reagan won the white vote by 20 points. In 2012, when famed car-elevator enthusiast Mitt Romney lost to Barack Obama, he also won the white vote. He won it by 20 points. But in 32 years, the Hispanic share of the electorate quintupled from 2 percent to 10 percent. The reason, as any demographics-obsessed conservative could tell you, was the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act. Passed by a Democratic House, signed by Reagan, it legalized 2.8 million mostly-Hispanic border-crossers. The new Americans brought their families up from Mexico. They had kids. According to the Public Policy Institute of California, the state's Hispanic birthrate rose from 3.2 children per woman in 1987 to 4.4 in 1991. And 21 years later, Reagan's own California had become a Democratic landslide state. John McCain's Arizona gave Democrats five of nine available House seats. Sen. Jeff Flake only barely won his 2012 race, because 18 percent of voters were Hispanic, and they went for the Democrat by 46 points. If they're going to pass any kind of legalization plan, Republicans have to answer two questions they've been putting off. Are they willing to add millions of potential Hispanic voters? And if they are--if they are willing to pass some McCain-Rubio-Schumer bill--can they win these people over? This week, the most prominent Republicans are the ones saying yes. ""Regardless of the political benefits to one party or another,"" said Sen. Flake in a statement, ""moving ahead on immigration reform is good policy."" He's a member of the Senate ""Group of Eight,"" (I prefer ""Octogang"" but it hasn't caught on) and he can envision a near future where Hispanic voters don't see Republican and immediately think ""show me your papers"" or ""Joe Arpaio."" If that happens, they can win them again. Win enough of them, anyway. ""I've heard a lot of conservatives say, 'Hispanics are pro-life, pro-traditional marriage, and they should be Republicans,' "" said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform and a longtime pro-reform conduit between business groups and Republicans. ""That's good. But you can't go to someone's house, knock on the door, and say: 'I want to talk to you about all the things we agree on. While we talk, you won't mind if Igor here grabs your grandmother, who's 87 years old and has lived here forever, and drags her across the border 1,000 miles away? Oh, and we'll grab your friends from school and drag them out, too, because we have such a great time together.' If you remove the threat of self-deportation, it becomes a completely different conversation."" But how do you get there? Since Sunday night, when the Octogang's deal leaked to Politico, we haven't heard much from the demography-is-destiny Republicans. They believe, for cultural reasons, that Hispanic immigrants are natural Democratic voters. There is a theory of ""makers"" and ""takers,"" and no matter how many calluses they get picking lettuce, the new arrivals go into column two. The most honest Republican member of Congress' demographic group is Rep. Lou Barletta. He can trace his success to the mid-2000s immigration wars. He ran Hazleton, Pa., and pushed through the Illegal Immigration Relief Act.* It was all enforcement--fines on landlords who leased to illegal immigrants and denial of licenses to business that employed them. In 2010, he won a seat in Congress. In 2011, it was gerrymandered to protect him. ""Anyone who believes that they're going to win over the Latino vote is grossly mistaken,"" Barletta told Colby Itkowitz, Washington reporter for an Allentown paper. ""The majority that are here illegally are low-skilled or may not even have a high school diploma. The Republican Party is not going to compete over who can give more social programs out. They will become Democrats because of the social programs they'll depend on."" In 2006 and 2007, the Barlettas of the GOP combined this argument with two bogeymen: wan enforcement and a new surge of immigrants. Neither of those fears retains their old power. Border fencing, deportations, and border agents are all at or above the levels promised during the Bush era's failed immigration bills. And the Mexican economy simply isn't weak enough to inspire the old pace of border-crossings, something the president obliquely bragged about in his Tuesday immigration speech. That leaves Republicans with the demographic dare. And like Hannity, their opinion leaders just aren't really sure about the risks, not like they were before 2012. Last week, before the Octogang's framework came out, Sen. Marco Rubio called into Mark Levin's radio show. Levin, a conservative attorney who sees tyranny behind every White House rose bush, was brought into the radio industry by Hannity. Before he talked to Rubio, he swore that the GOP's immigration position had ""nothing to do"" with their defeat. Post-Rubio, he had been healed. ""We have de facto amnesty right now,"" said Levin, quoting Rubio's spin. ""When he said it, it set a light bulb off. Maybe I am a little slow."" On Tuesday, before Obama's speech, Rubio repeated the trick. The cynicism was rising, because the president was about to speak--to promise his own bill if the Octogang failed--and Republicans like Flake warned that Obama could ""poison the well."" But Limbaugh went easy, too. Instead of assuming that the new immigrants were lazy, natural takers, he asked Rubio if they were more industrious, more American. ""Are conservatives stuck in the past about misjudging why immigrants are drawn to America today?"" ""The folks I interact with,"" said Rubio, ""when they get to this country and they open their own business, they see the cost of government firsthand."" For a couple of minutes, on-air, two Republicans who wanted the party to win again agreed that they could convert the new arrivals. ""What you are doing is admirable and noteworthy,"" Limbaugh said. ""You are recognizing reality."" Correction, Jan. 30, 2013: This article originally misspelled the town name of Hazleton. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"	Will Hispanics Ever Support the GOP?
