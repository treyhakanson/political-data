Several other administration officials, including the vice president, will hit the road, too. These periodic jaunts are part of ""Recovery Summer,"" a months-long enterprise that, like the summer trips everyone else takes, will be punctuated by a single question: ""Are we there yet?"" Economists may say, yes, the economy is recovering (maybe), but the country says no. Only 25 percent say the economy is improving, according to a recent CBS survey. That's just one of the dark findings for the administration in a slew of recent polls that suggest that the administration's summer tour will do little to improve the president's political fortunes and those of his party. Three polls that came out in the last two days offer discouraging news for the White House. In the Washington Post/ABC News poll, public confidence in the president has hit a new low. Six in 10 voters say they lack faith in the president. In a CBS News poll, 54 percent of the country disapprove of his handling of the economy, the highest number to date. In a Pew Research Center/National Journal poll, the number of Americans who approve of the president's health care legislation, the signature achievement of his presidency so far, sits at an anemic 35 percent. When politicians are confronted with bad poll numbers, they often say that these surveys are just a ""snapshot in time."" That can be true. Fortunes can change. Doom is not locked in. But what's so bad about these surveys is that they paint a very dark picture about the president's ability to brighten the future. If Obama can't improve things for Democrats, no one can. And as bad as the president's numbers are, the Democrats in Congress are in even worse shape. Candidate Obama used to joke about rays of sunshine coming in when he started to speak. Now he brings the clouds. He's spent a great deal of time talking about the Recovery Act and health care reform, but the political fortunes of those programs are dismal, which suggests his ability to persuade and change minds is seriously damaged. He has been trying to sell the success of his stimulus legislation for months in speeches, interviews, and events all over the country. In the CBS poll, only 23 percent think it has helped the economy. Only 13 percent think it has helped them personally. Despite all of his efforts, people are either ignoring him or tuning him out--or they can't hear him over the bad economic news. Whatever the reason, the best argument Obama has for how he and Democrats have addressed the issue people care the most about is one that people aren't buying. The situation on health care is worse. There have been some signs that public opinion about health care was improving a little, but the Pew and CBS polls offer a darker outlook. Forty-nine percent disapprove of the new legislation, according to the CBS poll, and only 36 percent approve. Pew has nearly identical numbers. This is not the way the president said things would turn out last March in a stirring speech he gave to Democrats on the eve of the House health care vote: ""I am actually confident that it will end up being the smart thing to do politically because I believe that good policy is good politics. ... Betsy [Markey] is in a tough district. The biggest newspaper is somewhat conservative, as Betsy described. They weren't real happy with health care reform. They were opposed to it. Betsy, despite the pressure, announced that she was in favor of this bill. And lo and behold, the next day that same newspaper runs an editorial saying, you know what, we've considered this, we've looked at the legislation, and we actually are pleased that Congresswoman Markey is supporting the legislation."" The president has worked hard to improve the political fortunes of health care, but it hasn't worked. He might not want to try anymore. It's not just that he's ineffective. In the CBS poll, the only issue Obama was faulted for spending too much time on was health care. If he spends more time trying to convince people of the merits of health care (which only 6 percent told CBS was the country's most important problem), he risks being criticized for not spending enough time on the economy, which 39 percent of the country think is the most important problem. Fifty-two percent already think he's not spending enough time addressing economic problems. The best news for the president and Democrats is that 62 percent of those polled say that Congress should extend unemployment benefits. Republicans have blocked legislation that would do so and the president has gone after them for it. The White House also takes comfort in the fact that the country has an even lower opinion of Republicans in Congress than they do of the president. Still, 51 percent of the country tell the Washington Post that they'll vote for a Republican to put a brake on Obama policies, and those who say they are most likely to vote in the November elections say they prefer the GOP over Democratic rule by 56 percent to 41 percent. If that sentiment continues, the White House will have a bummer summer followed by a terrible fall. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter."

Or that he likes Republicans. ""I'm one of those people who thinks Republicans, in many cases, have messed up as much as Democrats,"" says the South Florida-based Tea Party activist. ""The Republican majority we used to have is just as responsible for the deficit as the Democrats."" Yet Wilkinson is also a plaintiff in a lawsuit to get a third party--which also calls itself the ""Florida Tea Party""--to give up its name. When I ask whether the ultimate goal of the lawsuit is to prevent the ""Tea Party"" from hurting the GOP, Wilkinson drops the pox-on-both-houses talk. Instead he sounds like Karl Rove with a whiteboard, pointing out the races in which the ""Tea Party"" could get X many votes to hurt Y candidates. ""They're running in very close races that conservatives can win,"" he says. ""They're trying to hand the election to Alan Grayson,"" a Democrat serving his first term in the House. ""That's a race conservatives can win."" This is the fear that Democrats fervently hope is legitimate: The Tea Party will tear the GOP apart. But Tea Party activists aren't acting the part. On the contrary, any attempt to break away and split conservative votes for the midterms is met with several megatons of force, from the courts to the Fox News studio. Democrats have worked so hard to foment and promote Republican infighting that you can almost hear them panting. In my inbox are five e-mails from Democratic strategists about Jeff Clark, a dissatisfied Virginia congressional candidate who's running as an independent for the seat held by Democrat Tom Perriello because he doesn't like GOP nominee Robert Hurt. Polls suggest that someone like Clark could split conservative votes and help the liberal incumbent. Republicans aren't blinking. ""Tom Perriello has done so much to alienate so many people that the folks in that district will look past whatever reservations they have about Robert Hurt,"" says Dan Shipley, a spokesman for the Virginia GOP. ""Clark is trying to exploit something that's not there."" The evidence backs up the GOP's Pollyanna theory. When Clark made his debut appearance before Tea Partiers, he was roundly heckled for giving Perriello a potentially easier path to re-election. In New York, rather than being rewarded for running a good race and looking for a rematch, Tea Party favorite Doug Hoffman has turned to raising chickens and is being brusquely shoved aside for a newer, prime-time-readier candidate. The Tea Party, far from being disgruntled, takes after third party insurgents like blue crabs take after the one smartass who tries to evade the barrel. ""Tea party activists know that a third party candidate running under the name 'Tea Party' can do nothing but siphon votes and help Democrats,"" says Chuck Muth, a Nevada Republican strategist. ""The activists get it. If more than 428 of them vote for a 'Tea Party' candidate instead of a Republican, that's a problem."" Muth didn't pick that number at random: 428 votes was Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's margin when he narrowly defeated Republican John Ensign in 1998. (Ensign went on to win the state's other Senate seat and, allegedly, get his parents to pay off his mistress's family.) This year, Reid consistently trails in polls against Sharron Angle, an ultraconservative former state legislator who rode Tea Party endorsements to a Republican primary win. Democrats want to believe that Scott Ashjian, a shady and unknown businessman who got onto the ballot as the ""Tea Party"" candidate, will scoop up thousands of votes and let Reid squeak by. Not likely. Local Tea Party activists got the jump on Ashjian, using a listserv to coordinate attacks on him, spread facts about his business and legal problems, and get as many people as possible on the record denouncing him. In short order he plunged from 18 percent to 5 percent in statewide polls. ""We neutralized him pretty quickly,"" says Eric Odom, a Tea Party activist who relocated to Nevada, in part, to help clobber Reid. ""We bought the Web address he was advertising on his Web site and pointed to StopAshjian.com--that only cost, like, $100. We traded talking points. We kind of shoved him into the spotlight, and it destroyed him, because he wasn't ready for it."" The campaign against Ashjian--whose campaign, such as it is, ignored e-mails and phone calls--included the accusation that he was a ""plant"" forced into the race by Reid himself. It was a popular accusation, repeated ad infinitum on Fox News and talk radio. No one, however, knows whether it is true. ""It was obvious to us that the Nevada candidate was a Reid plant, although we couldn't prove it to say it,"" says Sal Russo, president of the Tea Party Express, which ran an ad telling Ashjian to ""get lost"" and quit. ""Little doubt in my mind."" The same thing is happening in Florida, where the much-maligned ""Tea Party"" is battling the charge that it's funded by Alan Grayson. The charge is mainly based on a 2008 payment Grayson made to Doug Guetzloe, a radio host and strategist who helps run the party, and another payment to a pollster who is now running as a ""Tea Party"" candidate for the state legislature. ""This is Republican B.S.,"" says Guetzloe. ""I've seen polls where the 'Florida Tea Party' does better than the GOP candidates, and that's because the Florida Republican Party is sinking and sinking. They're just afraid that the 'Florida Tea Party' is going to overtake them."" It's all very confusing to Peg Dunmire, the ""Tea Party"" candidate who's running against Grayson and claims not even to have been asked whether the rumor is true. ""I have tracked the 17 articles about this--I did a research project on this, and realized that everyone was pulling this stuff from one article without checking."" When she talks about her party or the fear that she'll help re-elect Grayson, Dunmire sounds the same notes as the Perotistas and Naderites of yore. ""I say we live in a land of competition,"" she says. ""For the last 16 years we have as a nation been dissatisfied with the performance of Congress. It doesn't matter who're sending, Republicans or Democrats. The public says, we don't like what Congress is doing."" Those, of course, are also the things that Tea Party activists--the kind without scare quotes--say before grudgingly backing Republicans. ""I was registered Libertarian,"" shrugs Eric Odom. ""I voted for Bob Barr in 2008. So that third-party option has already been tried. Doing that doesn't outweigh the benefits of beating Democrats."" Like  Slateon Facebook. Follow  Slate on Twitter."

""Republican leaders in Washington just don't get it,"" President Obama said this weekend after the GOP senators voted to block an extension of unemployment benefits. During the House debate last week over financial services reform, Mike Pence, the Republican conference chairman, criticized the Democrats: ""When you look at this legislation, it is proof positive again that this majority just doesn't get it."" In Arizona, backers of the state's controversial immigration law are selling T-shirts that read: ""The President Just Doesn't Get It."" When the Justice Department announced Tuesday that it would file suit to overturn the law, Rep. Harry Mitchell of Arizona responded, ""The only thing this lawsuit will do is demonstrate to Arizonans that Washington still doesn't get it."" Voters are angry this election year. A recent Washington Post poll showed that only 29 percent of Americans said they would support their House representative in November, even lower than before the historic 1994 election. Politicians who claim their opponents ""don't get it"" hope to stoke that anger into rage: The politician disappointing you does so not because he's incompetent, but because he doesn't care what you say. This is the animating sentiment behind the Tea Party movement. ""The government doesn't want to hear us,"" said one protester at an Obama health care rally in Iowa earlier this year in the final days of the health care debate. ""We have to make them listen."" I'm sorry, were you saying something? Both sides are focusing on highlighting just how bad the other party is in part because they can't satisfy voter anger by talking about solutions. People aren't in a mood to believe in promises from Washington. And, for different reasons, neither party has much to say. Democrats can't excite people with the programs they've passed. Only 33 percent of those asked in a recent Pew poll think the stimulus bill has helped create jobs. Health care reform is getting more popular, but even in the most optimistic polls, fewer than 50 percent of respondents view it favorably. Republicans aren't offering detailed solutions because they have made a tactical decision to stay vague about what they would actually do if they took control. They don't want to offend anyone, and they'd prefer this election be a referendum on unpopular Democratic programs. If politicians can't recognize problems, how can they solve them? That question was at the center of the charge Obama made last week in Wisconsin when he criticized House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, for seeming to compare the financial crisis to an insect. ""If the Republican leader is that out of touch with the struggles facing the American people, he should come here to Racine and ask people if they think the financial crisis was an ant."" Those who aren't out of touch don't hear you because they are compromised. When the Senate was debating a version of the financial reform bill, the president charged that the Senate Republican leader was ignoring the obvious benefits of the legislation because he was beholden to the Wall Street bankers he was courting for campaign donations. Democrats charge willful incompetence. Republicans blame arrogance. For months, Republican leaders have peppered their public statements on a range of issues with the charge that the president and Democratic leaders are so ideological they are deaf to the outcry from the public. ""Americans want us to listen to them on health care,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., during the health care debate. ""They've been telling us so for an entire year. Incredibly, our friends on the other side still don't seem to get it. But Americans see what's going on. And that's why they'll reject this bill again."" Obama has given his opponents ammunition. On issues from stimulus to health care to his handling of the BP oil spill, he and his aides have blamed their problems on poor communication. ""He seems to think we just don't understand what's going on because he hasn't had the chance--in his 411 speeches and 158 interviews last year--to adequately explain his policies to us,"" Sarah Palin wrote during the health care debate. ""Instead of sensibly telling the American people, 'I'm listening,' the president is saying, 'Listen up, people!' This approach is precisely the reason people are upset with Washington."" When politicians aren't accusing their opponents of not listening, they are trying hard to show how much they themselves are. After Republican Scott Brown won Ted Kennedy's Massachusetts Senate seat last winter, Obama made ""I hear you"" the theme of his State of the Union address. Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., is credited with reviving her candidacy after airing an ad in which she professed that she was listening. ""I'm Blanche Lincoln, and I know you're angry at Washington. Believe me, I heard you."" Republicans have constructed an elaborate listening exercise called ""America Speaking Out,"" which seeks to solicit ideas from voters that will inform the future GOP agenda. By hearing from the people, Boehner promises, Republicans will ""change the way Washington works."" The theory underlying the Republican position is that if something isn't popular, the president shouldn't be doing it. Boehner has taken this view one step further. When debating whether the stimulus bill has worked, he has cited not the number of jobs created, but public opinion polls that show people don't like it. As Steve Benen pointed out recently, Boehner is using the listening exercise to avoid being specific on policy. This view is a complete reversal from what was once the prevailing Republican view of leadership. During the Bush presidency, public opposition to the war didn't matter. As Dick Cheney put it: ""It may not be popular with the public--it doesn't matter in the sense that we have to continue the mission and do what we think is right. And that's exactly what we're doing. We're not running for office. We're doing what we think is right."" This was also true of domestic affairs during the Bush era. When the president launched his plan to create Social Security private accounts, he cited the idea's unpopularity as one of its virtues. ""That's why we run for office,"" Bush said in a 2005 speech about the political opposition he faced. (Only 35 percent of Americans approved of the plan at the time.) ""Someone said, 'It's a steep hill to climb, Mr. President.' Well, my attitude is, the steeper, the better--because when you get up top, you realize you have left a significant contribution behind."" By this unpopularity/elevation calculus, Obama's health care plan puts him above the treeline. Politicians have been saying their opponents are out of touch for ages. But it's a terrible idea to link a politician's fortunes to his ability to ""hear"" the public. This is not a claim that comes from the cable-news era. It is the thesis of Walter Lippmann's book Public Opinion, published in 1922. Some 88 years later, politicians are debating how to stimulate the economy and tame the deficit, which will require making hard choices. Yet according to a recent Pew Research Center poll, the people politicians are supposed to be listening to in order to show they ""get it"" are themselves incapable of making those hard choices. Respondents said that, yes, they wanted states to balance their budgets--and then large majorities opposed specific measures required to do so.

4	4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/06/payback_time.html	"President Obama's debt commission was designed to be insulated from politics. With 10 Democrats and eight Republicans, the panel would give both sides cover to make the difficult choices--tax hikes and spending cuts--necessary to reduce the deficit. But a hearing on Wednesday--the commission's third since its creation in April--proved the insulation was flimsy at best. The hearing's only witness was Doug Elmendorf, director of the Congressional Budget Office and therefore Washington's most deliberate nonpartisan. He doesn't opine. He doesn't make policy recommendations. He simply makes budget estimates based on current law. (Check out his new projection here.) But no matter how many times Elmendorf repeated this mantra, it didn't seem to get through. Instead, Democrats and Republicans spent the morning trying to get Elmendorf to confirm their own vision of the world. Former Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, the commission's Republican co-chairman, began the hearing with a lamentation about its politicization. Instead of honest criticism, critics use ""flash words"" to undercut its mission: ""Cut social security. Balance the budget on the backs of seniors. Nail the rich. Cheat the poor. Hurt doctors. Help lawyers."" He also took issue with his own portrayal as an ""ornery old rump."" Elmendorf was careful not to take a stance on anything, including Simpson. After a depressing summary--debt as a percentage of GDP is higher than at any time since World War II; bringing it back down to a sustainable level would require cuts that ""represent the near elimination of all government programs except for Social Security Medicare, Medicaid, and national defense""--he presented two budget projections. One assumes current laws continue, while the other assumes certain laws change--that the Bush tax cuts aren't allowed to expire, the Alternative Minimum Tax patch continues, and the ""doc fix"" that props up physician reimbursement remains. He also made sure not to endorse one particular approach to reining in the budget: ""There's no intrinsic contradiction between fiscal stimulus and fiscal restraint a few years from now,"" he said. When Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., asked him when Congress should declare the recession over and move ahead with deficit reduction, Elmendorf called time out: ""You used the word should, and you know should is not a word the CBO uses."" Even so, every panelist tried to lure Elmendorf over to their side. Democrats complained that the CBO's alternative budget projection--the bleak one that assumes the Bush tax cuts, AMT patch, etc., stay in place--doesn't give health care reform enough credit, since it assumes that many of the cost savings in the bill will disappear after 2020. ""What you're affirming is if key elements of the health care bill were repealed, the deficit would grow even more,"" said Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, adding that such an assumption oversteps the CBO's mandate. ""You've taken a hypothetical about future congressional action,"" she said. ""We should use you as prognosticator and fortune teller."" Sen. Max Baucus of Montana, too, griped that the CBO's projection has ""raised some eyebrows"" by ""trying to predict what Congress will or will not do."" Elmendorf argued that health care reform wasn't that big a deal, at least from a budget standpoint. Cost savings due to Medicare were comparatively small. ""Well,"" said Baucus, ""our challenge is to prove you wrong."" Republicans didn't hesitate to show their hand either. Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas, prefacing his remarks by noting that the stimulus was an ""abysmal failure,"" asked Elmendorf whether it's fair to say that health care reform was ""not a game changer."" Elmendorf didn't bite, emphasizing instead that it's hard to predict long-term growth rates decades from now. ""OK,"" Hensarling said. ""I'll use the phrase 'not a game changer.' "" Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin took a swipe at health care reform, too, highlighting a graph that compared future federal spending with health care reform to growth without it. He said it looked to him like the reforms ""don't really bend the cost curve very much. The health care prices are still going up even with the passage of this legislation, is that correct?"" Elmendorf basically said they were using current growth rates and it was too far out to predict. Other Republicans tried to write the future by pushing Elmendorf to use the alternative scenario as his baseline. That is, to assume that the Bush tax cuts and AMT patch and doc fix--all of which put money in the pockets of Americans--are permanent. That assumption may be more realistic. It's also partisan, implicitly daring the Democrats to ""raise taxes."" All the disagreement made Durbin pessimistic. ""We have a pretty tough challenge here,"" he said. ""I don't know if it's politically possible. I look around the table, and we all view the world in different terms."" The only people who seemed willing to set partisanship aside were the two guys who don't need to worry about getting re-elected: Co-chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, who was President Bill Clinton's chief of staff. Simpson reiterated that getting to zero will be painful. Health care reform won't be enough. And unless Democrats get comfortable with spending cuts and Republicans learn to love tax hikes--he rattled off a list of taxes Ronald Reagan raised--we might as well just surrender now. ""If we don't get anything done by Dec. 1,"" he said, ""I'm out there in the high country and you can tap on my box in 20 years and tell me how it worked out then."" Like  Slate on Facebook.

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/06/crisis_management_101.html	"The presidency should come with a neck brace. Two days ago, Barack Obama was struggling to stay on top of the oil spill in the Gulf while simultaneously trying to do something (anything) about the anemic economy, pitch a new energy initiative, and kick-start the selling of health care reform. Then, out of the blue, another crisis: In less than 48 hours, Obama had to reassess his Afghanistan strategy, its military leader, and the entire civilian-military relationship. It was a test--more of a pop quiz, really--of Obama's leadership skills. He had to push back against the dismissive and derisive attitude shown by Gen. Stanley McChrystal and his men toward the civilian command in an article published in Rolling Stone. At the same time, he had to be careful not to sap military morale or undermine the policy that he still supports in Afghanistan. He aced it. In his Rose Garden statement Wednesday, the president was resolute and commanding--two qualities that critics have been looking for in his management of the Gulf oil crisis. The difference is that, on this issue, Obama is in complete control: He is, after all, the commander in chief. But the president also showed some consideration--praising McChrystal and explaining his firing in context. While he and McChrystal agreed on the strategy in Afghanistan, a larger principle was at issue. ""War is bigger than any one man or woman, whether a private, a general or a president,"" Obama said. McChrystal's conduct ""did not meet the standard that should be set by a commanding general,"" undermines civilian control of the armed forces, and threatens the mission. With his careful, lawyerly explanation, Obama did not appear to be a man acting in a fit of pique. Obama was also careful to explain the more immediate principle at stake: ""This is a change in personnel, not in policy,"" said the president in a line that sounded like empty rhetoric but wasn't. By picking Gen. David Petraeus as McChrystal's replacement, Obama was doubling down on the counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan. The tough, ugly, and painstaking business of winning the population will continue, as will the stories about how hard that is on the troops being asked to carry it out. (It also means the tension between the military and the current ambassador, Karl Eikenberry, also remains.) The neck brace for the presidency might also help its occupants with the ideological swivel they sometimes have to make. Petraeus, now the president's savior, was the architect of the strategy Obama once denounced when he was a senator and President Bush was hoping Petraeus and his counterinsurgency strategy would turn things around in Iraq. If Petraeus can do for Afghanistan what he did for Iraq, people will no doubt call for handing him the presidency (for now, Petraeus will be too busy to flirt with a run in 2012). The president's view was that McChrystal had used up his third strike. Before the latest Rolling Stone story, he had criticized Vice President Joe Biden in a speech in London while the Afghanistan review was under way. The White House also blames him for leaking his classified review. (Pentagon officials argue strenuously that there's no evidence for this second charge.) The question for the president now is how much of the McChrystal business will continue to be litigated in the coming months. The tit-for-tat between the military and the White House that was at the heart of the damaging article has been going on since before the Afghanistan policy was announced. Now there's a new chapter. How many in the military will see McChrystal's departure as an overreaction to some stupid words rather than a necessary act of civilian command? McChrystal and his aides never did challenge civilian authority, after all. The president called for that bickering to end: ""[N]ow is the time for all of us to come together,"" he said, vowing that ""while I welcome debate ...  I won't tolerate division."" It may be that this controversy will linger for a few more days. But if those orders get through, Obama will be free to move on to tomorrow's head-snapping dilemma.

6	6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/06/stan_not_the_man.html	"Last week Gen. David Petraeus collapsed. This week Gen. Stanley McChrystal did. The top commander in Afghanistan and his team were the subject of a profile in Rolling Stone in which they looked petty, frustrated, and reckless. President Obama and his staff now must evaluate whether to relieve McChrystal of his command. You're never supposed to surprise your boss. The story not only surprised Obama, it presented him with a new problem when he's already facing a few. Yet unlike his most recent problem--the Gulf spill, where he's limited by what he can do--on this issue, the president has total control. He has two decisions to make. The first is about McChrystal's future. The second is about the strategy in Afghanistan. Whatever the president decides about McChrystal, he will have to explain it in the context of the strategy in Afghanistan. As a Pentagon official has said, ""McChrystal is the Afghanistan strategy."" In the article McChrystal himself says Obama was unprepared in their first meeting and makes fun of Vice President Joe Biden as well as Richard Holbrooke, the administration's special envoy to Pakistan and Afghanistan. He also appears to knock the current Ambassador to Afghanistan Karl Eikenberry. And the quotes from his aides are worse. The general view of his team seems to be that they know best and Washington is clueless; one aide calls White House National Security Adviser James Jones a ""clown."" Granted, this is the kind of trash talking that goes on every day in private and particularly around men trained to be ferocious and fight wars. These guys were just dumb enough to do it in front of a reporter, and in some cases it appears as though this talk occurred in McChrystal's presence. He's responsible for his team, and they wouldn't speak so freely if they thought the boss believed something else. But the fact that McChrystal himself does not seem to have said anything insubordinate may be the deciding factor in how the president treats him now. Also, a lot of the material is also about personalities and behavior, not the policy in Afghanistan. McChrystal responded to the story by calling Vice President Biden and others involved. He did not speak with the president but offered an apology. ""Throughout my career, I have lived by the principles of personal honor and professional integrity,"" he said. ""What is reflected in this article falls far short of that standard."" He will have a chance to offer it in person. Obama has called him back to join Wednesday's regularly scheduled meeting about the war. What's does McChrystal actually think about the president? There's a high degree of frustration with the administration obvious in the Rolling Stone article, but it doesn't come across that McChrystal thinks Obama doesn't know what he's doing. In conversations I had with sources involved in the military side of the Afghanistan-Pakistan review at the end of last year, McChrystal was described as feeling very positive about how the president handled the process. (He wasn't positive about everyone in the administration.) Obama was described as in command of the process, playing an honest broker in the battle between the various factions. Obama isn't the only boss McChrystal has irritated. He's also ticked off Defense Secretary Robert Gates. Gates, as a general matter, hates this kind of talking out of school. It reflects badly on the mission if the person leading it shows this lack of judgment. Also, McChrystal was Gates' handpicked general. And internally, it puts the Pentagon on the defensive in the intramural battles with the White House. Reports are that Obama is ""furious."" What House aides were already chafing at pressure they were getting from the military to soften the terms of the planned withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan in July. A lot of people have been calling lately for Obama to get angry. (If only Tony Hayward's aides had said stupid things to Rolling Stone.) Congressman David Obey, a fierce war critic, has called for Obama to fire McChrystal. But this is probably a case in which the country needs the calm, unemotional Obama. This particular Rolling Stone story, and the months-long fracas between the White House and Pentagon over Afghanistan strategy, already has too much testosterone. If for no other reason than to bring the humors in alignment, there needs to be a force for restraint. There are a lot of reasons for the president to overreact. He has to send a message--to his military, to foreign leaders, and to political opponents--that reaffirms the general principle of civilian control of the military and his control of the Pentagon in particular. There's also a cheap public relations reason to slap McChrystal extra hard. Given the criticism Obama has received for not showing command in the Gulf, he could presumably use this opportunity to look tough. At the same time, it's important to see this controversy in context, and that argues for restraint. The article is an outgrowth of a skirmish that has been going on since the Afghanistan policy review started last year. Obama made his policy choice in December--essentially, send more troops but with a clear date in July 2011 for withdrawal--but the battle has continued behind the scenes. One recent battle concerned Jonathan Alter's account of the policy review in his book, which Pentagon officials read as a score-settling by those in the administration who felt the military had tried to roll them. The president has to send the clear message: enough. But the main reason the president has to show restraint is that he can't let the controversy become a proxy for undoing the Afghanistan policy he still supports. He has to rap McChrystal on the knuckles but turn the message back to the mission--the war in Afghanistan is at a very tough point. Violence is increasing, and this year may be one of the deadliest years for American troops. Progress has been slow. Unless Obama has problems with McChrystal's performance, and there's no evidence that he does, McChrystal's remarks are beside the point. McChrystal will have to go back to Afghanistan and carry out Obama's mission, and he can't do that from a weakened position. That's true not just with his own troops, but with leaders in Afghanistan. If the administration posture is really to be more accommodating of President Karzai then getting rid of McChrystal makes no sense. He's the administration's best asset with the Afghan president. Everyone I talk to, both inside and outside Washington culture, wants to know: Why would McChrystal (or his aides) say such things? One Pentagon source says the volcanic ash is to blame. The reporter was supposed to have limited time with McChrystal. When the ash hit, the general and his team were stuck. The reporter essentially became embedded. The military men forgot they had a reporter near and expressed sentiments that are very close to the top (sometimes because they were drunk). The most damaging part of the article, from a policy perspective, is its description of the counterinsurgency strategy. This is the central theory behind both the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. Petraeus used to be the face of the counterinsurgency doctrine--calm, learned, steady. McChrystal was thought to be in his mold. If this article becomes gospel, there's a chance that the reckless McChrystal becomes the new face of the strategy. This will make it harder for proponents to argue for the strategy in the future if for no other reason than it distracts from signs of progress. The second half of the article suggests that the strategy has been a failure because the troops asked to carry out the theory don't buy it. This is one of the key challenges and tensions of counterinsurgency warfare, as Marine Gen. James Mattis explained when I talked to him earlier this year. But the tension between assuming more physical risk and using less force in the hopes of winning over the population is not a new tension. It's a part of the strategy and complexity that Obama signed onto after months of review. Still, that doesn't mean that Obama welcomes the chance to reiterate his strategic rationale. This controversy will kidnap the White House agenda. Today's message was supposed to be about health care, and in his remarks the president was distracted by a fly. He shooed it away, joking that the last time that had happened he'd dispatched the fly completely. This McChrystal story is a much bigger distraction and will require much more careful handling.

7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/06/bartons_blunder.html	"When a player scores on his team in soccer, it's called an own goal. In politics, it may be known for a while as a Joe Barton. He's the Texas Republican House member who started Thursday apologizing to the CEO of BP and ended the day apologizing for his apology--twice. Barton made the retractions after ""consulting"" with Republican leaders, in the hopes of limiting the damage to his party, keeping his committee assignment, and diminishing the political opportunity for Democrats. It was supposed to be BP's sorry day.  First its chairman, Carl-Henric Svanberg, apologized for calling the residents of the Gulf ""small people.""* Then its CEO, Tony Hayward, was scheduled for a day of saying sorry during a hearing on Capitol Hill devoted to the string of BP failures that led to the ongoing disaster. When the hearing started, though, Barton was steaming. As the top Republican on the committee, he told Hayward that he was ""ashamed"" that the White House had pushed the company into creating a $20 billion fund to cover claims associated with the spill. It was a ""shakedown"" said Barton, a ""tragedy of the first proportion""--which is something, considering how grim the tragedies are that get a first-proportion ranking. For those who have been looking for acts of determination, resolution, and core conviction on the public stage, here was a good example of the form. There were audible gasps in the room. They may have been from Republicans. With public disapproval of BP at 80 percent, and nearly daily disclosures of its mishandling of the Deepwater operation, the company is a pariah. How toxic is BP? To deliver a knockout blow to the climate change legislation the president supports, Senate Republicans have been saying that BP backs it. So this was not a time to be apologizing. GOP staffers talked about the blunder in historic terms. Twice in e-mail exchanges I had with veterans, they cited their years of service before noting they'd never heard something so stupid. ""He put his Republican colleagues in a difficult position, he put Republican senators in a difficult position and he put every Republican candidate in a difficult position who has to answer for him,"" said one aide. ""And he's thrown the White House a lifeline."" Barton was instructed by GOP leaders to reverse course--apologize and retract or face losing his rank on the committee. He apologized grudgingly, saying, ""[I]f anything I said this morning has been misconstrued to the opposite effect I want to apologize for that misconstrued misconstruction."" That wasn't good enough. Later, in a second apology, he apologized for using term ""shakedown"" and retracted his apology to BP. To drive the point home, House Republican leaders put out their own statement calling Barton ""wrong,"" and saying the $20 billion fund was a proper way to hold the company accountable. ""BP itself has acknowledged that responsibility for the economic damages lies with them and has offered an initial pledge of $20 billion for that purpose."" Barton is still apparently on probation. ""If he's the Joe Barton of 3 o'clock today, fine,"" says one aide. ""But if he's the Joe Barton of 10 o'clock, he has a problem."" The Barton rig had blown at around 10 a.m., and by 4 p.m. GOP leaders had contained the initial damage. (If only federal officials had moved as quickly to clean up the Gulf oil spill.) But Democrats were working hard to exploit the environmental damage. The White House led the charge. First Vice President Joe Biden said the apology was ""incredibly insensitive"" and ""incredibly out of touch"" with those whose lives have been affected by the disaster. Then White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs suggested Barton be stripped of his position. It was a secondary benefit for the White House that what was being debated was the president's tough action on BP. Obama had been criticized for weeks for not showing leadership. Now he was being criticized for using his office too forcefully. Democrats have been searching for a way to make this year's election a choice between two parties and not a referendum on President Obama's performance. They see this as one of their best opportunities to date. The hope is to make Barton emblematic of a Republican mind-set--so in favor of big corporations and oblivious to the little guy that he would apologize for a fund designed to pay back out-of-work fishermen and others devastated by the spill. This strategy has been tried before. Democrats have tried to make Republican senatorial candidates Rand Paul in Kentucky and Sharron Angle in Nevada representative of the party. Their efforts have been hampered in part because those two candidates have been disciplined or shown self-discipline. When Paul said the attack on BP was ""un-American,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refuted the comments and advised Paul to stop talking. Angle learned that lesson and is staying mum  (or at least she's trying to). What makes Barton different is that he is the ranking member of the committee, given his rank by the party leadership. He's a powerful figure, not a fringe candidate. Gibbs tried to drive this point home in 140 characters on Twitter: ""Who would the GOP put in charge of overseeing the energy industry & Big Oil if they won control of Congress? Yup, u guessed it - JOE BARTON."" Democrats also pointed out that Barton was not alone in holding this view. The 114-member Republican Study Committee put out a press release Wednesday calling the fund a ""shakedown."" By the end of the day David Plouffe, Obama's campaign manager in 2008, had sent an e-mail to millions of Obama's supporters asking them to sign an ""open letter"" that would send a message to Barton to show ""him and other Republicans that they weren't elected to defend big oil."" Even if people sign on to the effort, it's not a letter that Plouffe will ever send. The reality is there's not a single thing about Joe Barton's behavior they'd like to change.

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/06/deflection_point.html	"The Gulf oil crisis, say White House aides, is at an ""inflection point."" That's why President Obama chose this moment to deliver his first Oval Office address. If you've forgotten this term from calculus, it means ""turning point."" But it's not a dramatic change in direction where the tires squeal--if you're driving an S, it's the moment when the steering wheel is straight. It means the situation is less bad than it used to be. Something similar can be said of the president's 20-minute speech: It wasn't as bad as it could have been. He offered the rhetorical flourishes we expect and was specific in some cases--he called for a fund to pay Gulf residents that would not be controlled by BP--he talked about deploying the National Guard and putting the secretary of the Navy in charge of restoring the wetlands not just to their condition before the spill but better. He charged BP with ""recklessness"" and promised that the company would pay. He promised that he wouldn't forget the Gulf. But there was something lacking. Maybe that's to be expected when you use the terminology of mathematics while playing by the laws of politics. If you declare a turning point, one will duly arrive, and the president will be credited with creating it. The pivot will take place. The page will turn. The fever will break. There are only cliches for this phenomenon because it is essentially a magic trick that requires a lot of conjuring. The president is constrained. He can't stop the leak. And he doesn't seem to be able to do much about the confusion reported on the ground. Reaction plans are being hatched on the fly. The speech felt like more of a management update of the crisis than an attempt to take command of it. Maybe the call for a heroic moment of command is too much to ask for. Still, the president made the situation worse for himself. The use of the language of war created the imbalance. He talked of a ""battle"" and ""siege,"" but like all the other times when war has been misused--the war on drugs, the war on poverty, the economic war Joe Biden declared last year--the action taken didn't match the words used to describe the menace. Prudent, methodical, and secure ... Wait a minute. There's a war going on. Shouldn't we be doing something more? In the context of war, the facts and figures--miles of boom, strength of National Guard troops deployed, number of ships at sea--feel meaningless. Sure, they sound impressive--but compared with what? Today, for example, we learned that the amount of oil flowing from the ground is between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels a day. Last week the estimate was between 20,000 and 40,000. The president did offer welcome specificity when he said that soon BP should be able to capture 90 percent of the oil leaking from the well. There were hints earlier in the day that Obama might use the power of an Oval Office speech to make a push for robust climate change legislation. He talked a lot about it, using the kind of language we're used to hearing when we're being called to national action. But all of those words added up to less than what he's already said. Several weeks ago in a speech in Pittsburgh, Obama was far more forceful. He called for an aggressive comprehensive legislative response. He said he would fight to find the votes to pass a bill that put a price on carbon. During the health care debate, supporters of the public option learned how to spot a presidential endorsement that was no endorsement at all. Though the president claimed to support the idea, there was no oomph in his voice. He's matching that strategy on this issue. He sounds like he'll take just about anything, a recognition perhaps of how tough a comprehensive bill would be in this election year. This is not the first time the White House has declared an inflection point on this story. On May 24, when Coast Guard Commander Thad Allen briefed reporters from the White House on all that the administration had done, it was intended to deflect the criticism that too little had been accomplished. A White House  official wrote an e-mail to me declaring the moment an ""inflection point."" Three weeks later the president is still trying to show command--proving that even when you're in an inflection point, it's not clear whether things are getting worse or better.

9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/06/presidential_anger_management.html	"While no one has yet discovered a way to plug the BP oil leak, each day does bring the discovery of yet another fundamental character defect that explains President Obama's helplessness. He's not emotional enough. He lacks crisis experience. He is insufficiently creative. With the leak likely to last into the summer, before long it will be blamed on Obama's bad penmanship or his skinny legs. The one question we'll always be able to ask, fortunately, is whether the president is sufficiently angry. In the daily temperature reading that has become the White House press briefing, spokesman Robert Gibbs once again addressed the president's temper. ""Our point is not to feign, through method acting, anger at what environmental and economic damage has been wrought by this disaster. That wasn't going to fill a hole. That wasn't going to put money in the bank account of a shrimper that's not fishing. That's not going to help a hotel worker or a hotel owner on a beach in Florida."" Here's the thing about presidential anger. It's never seen in public--not just from our first smooth jazz president, but from any president. If presidents show anger in public, they risk looking out of control, which in moments of crisis is the exact opposite of what people want. When there is anger, it's not often constructive anger. Perhaps the most well-known angry president moment was when Bill Clinton denied having ""sexual relations"" with Monica Lewinsky. Yes, that anger was targeted at a specific problem. But it was not exactly helpful. Clinton had other moments. The New York Times' John Harwood reminds me that Clinton chewed out Brit Hume, then of ABC News, when he asked about a ""certain zigzag quality in the decision-making process"" of his nomination to the Supreme Court of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who had just made a speech. ""How you could ask a question like that after the statement she just made is beyond me,"" he said. George W. Bush had moments of real resolve--his speech with a bullhorn at Ground Zero--and he had moments of dime-store resolve--when he said ""bring 'em on"" and that he wanted Osama Bin Laden ""dead or alive."" But the only glimpse we got of his anger was when he told us about it. Do you remember the issue that caused it? In March 2002 Bush said he'd gotten ""plenty hot"" when he learned that the INS had approved a visa for one of the 9/11 bombers after a seven-month delay. It's not that presidents don't get angry. They show it as candidates. Clinton shouted down a heckler. George H.W. Bush's most irritated moment happened during an interview with Dan Rather in 1988. Ronald Reagan's most explosive and famous moment came in Nashua, N.H., at a primary event with Republican candidates. As ex-president, Jimmy Carter had a throwdown with Sudanese officials. We don't see presidential anger, but we hear about it later either in carefully planted quotes--a week after the spill, Gibbs let it be known that Obama told aides ""plug the damn hole""--or those well-reported books. Or we hear about it later on a presidential recording. (Here's John Kennedy getting angry about Air Force furniture. Here's Lyndon Johnson giving the business to Albert Thomas.) Sometimes presidents are dimed out by their friends and successors. Thomas Jefferson described George Washington as a man who mostly kept a lid on his anger but when he ""broke his bonds, he was most tremendous in his wrath,"" falling ""into one of those passions when he cannot command himself."" If you want to make a president angry, one way to do it is to talk to them about their anger. Nixon, we know from the Watergate tapes, had a deep and abiding anger, but in public he didn't let it show. ""The tougher it gets,"" he used to say, ""the cooler I get."" But then he was asked about his anger. ""Don't get the impression that you arouse my anger,"" said the president to a reporter during a news conference. ""You see, one can only be angry with those he respects."" The angriest Obama has gotten in public was when he was asked about (wait for it) why he didn't get angry enough. One exception to this rule is John Kennedy's public fight with American steel companies. In private, Kennedy used a wide range of expletives to describe what the steel companies were doing to the economy (and to him). His power was questioned in the press and he responded by showing his anger in public. Ultimately the steel companies backed down. Perhaps Obama will take a lesson from his predecessor. This week BP executives will be in Washington. The White House now says that Obama might meet with some of them. Given the buildup, they might want to ask for Secret Service protection.

10	10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/06/women_on_top.html	"Charges of infidelity aren't what they used to be. In South Carolina, GOP gubernatorial candidate Nikki Haley was accused of not keeping faith with her marriage vows, and in Arkansas, Democratic Sen. Blanche Lincoln was accused of not keeping faith with her party. But tonight, both women survived the attacks, as Haley finished first in her primary and Lincoln won her runoff. Lincoln's victory upset the longstanding conventional wisdom that says an incumbent loses when there is a runoff as well as the 2010 conventional wisdom that incumbents are doomed in this anti-Washington year. She also complicated the plans of organized labor, which wanted to use the Lincoln race to kick off a new tough message to Democrats: Take us for granted, and we'll remove you from office. Unlike Haley, whose accusers had no proof of her adultery and whose opponents largely avoided pressing the claims about her, Lincoln faced an organized and concerted effort. Labor unions and Democratic activists spent an estimated $10 million to defeat her. They failed. Labor unions will claim that they pushed Lincoln to the left and that other moderate senators will have to do the same. Perhaps, but that's not a great return on investment. When you're trying to send a message, losing interferes with the signal. The White House pushed back hard against labor. A senior administration official told me ""organized labor just flushed $10 million of their members' money down the toilet on a pointless exercise. If even half that total had been well-targeted and applied in key House races across this country, that could have made a real difference in November."" It was harder to tease national messages out of these races, unlike last month's contests, though there will be a vigorous debate in Democratic circles between establishment party members, unions, and grass-roots activists. While labor's reputation has been diminished tonight, Bill Clinton's has improved. He campaigned hard for Lincoln, and when analysts look for what late-breaking thing made this narrow race turn, they may very well land on Clinton's last minute push, in which he accused labor unions of trying to manipulate voters. Lincoln will have a tough general election fight in a Republican-trending state. Immediately, the Democratic Senatorial Committee in Washington, D.C., tried to use Lincoln's defeat of the unions to help brand her as an independent. ""In this race Blanche took on powerful special interests in Washington and won,"" said the committee's chairman, Sen. Robert Menendez. In South Carolina, Nikki Haley trounced her opponents but failed, by a whisper, to avoid a runoff. On June 22, she will face Gresham Barrett, who received 22 percent of the vote to Haley's 49 percent. The question now for Barrett is whether he'll face pressure to drop out of the race or whether he'll be able to raise money in the coming weeks. (Despite the adultery allegations and lie-detector tests in the governor's race, South Carolina's most interesting political development of the night may actually be that six-term Republican incumbent congressman Bob Inglis also faces a runoff, after trailing his opponent Trey Gowdy by 12 points.) If Haley wins, it could help improve the image of the South Carolina GOP, which has stumbled since the adultery scandal that disgraced Gov. Mark Sanford--and which has some comic-book villains. She would be the favorite in November, which means that the Republican Party, still dogged by its history of preying on white-Southern fears about African-Americans, would have two Southern governors of Indian descent. As the night drew to a close, it looked like a clean sweep for women in the evening's most anticipated contests. In California, Meg Whitman won the Republican gubernatorial nomination and Carly Fiorina won the Republican contest to take on Sen. Barbara Boxer. In Nevada, Sharron Angle seemed on her way to winning the Republican nomination and the chance to challenge Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Nevada was the one state where infidelity did seem to play a role. Sitting Gov. Jim Gibbons, who has faced charges of adultery, was defeated in his primary.

11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/06/ladies_night.html	"In a volatile year in which the rules of politics are being rewritten, Tuesday's elections will render a verdict on an important question facing all candidates: Is it more damaging to be accused of adultery or to advocate paying for health care with chickens? In Nevada, Republican Sue Lowden cast her lot with the chickens and has lost the lead in her party's primary. In South Carolina, Nikki Haley has twice been accused of cheating on her husband and still appears to hold a wide lead--her candidacy may have even gotten stronger. In California and Arkansas, voters will have more conventional choices as they pick candidates for Senate and governor. Here's a look at each of the big races: Arkansas Democratic senatorial runoff. Blanche Lincoln is the biggest politician who may fall on Election Day. If so, she will join Utah Republican Robert Bennett and Republican-turned-Democrat Arlen Specter as incumbent senators who couldn't survive their primaries. A month ago, Lincoln barely defeated Lt. Gov. Bill Halter, who has been heavily backed by unions and progressive groups. Now those groups get a second shot because of Arkansas' runoff rules, and they're hoping to claim a victory not as much for Halter as for their muscle, showing at-risk Democrats there will be penalties if they don't heed party activists. If Halter wins, he faces a tough general-election campaign in this Republican-leaning state. The challenge will be how hard Democratic activists work for him once the anti-Lincoln message has been sent. ""He's not exactly the great white progressive hope,"" says one of the activists involved. If Lincoln pulls out a win, it will be a sign that it's possible in this throw-the-bums-out year, even as a two-term incumbent, to redirect some of the anti-insider anger at your opponent. In the weeks leading up to the election, Lincoln, with the aid of former president Bill Clinton, has been arguing that Halter is merely a captive of the unions, which are insiders, too. Nevada Republican senatorial primary: The latest poll out of Nevada shows Tea Party favorite Sharron Angle in the lead with 32 percent of the vote. Her opponents, Danny Tarkanian and Sue Lowden (she of the chicken comments), are effectively tied for second with 24 percent and 23 percent. Democrats have long been pushing the idea that the GOP is squandering its chances by electing ultra-conservative candidates who can't win in the general election. (See Paul, Rand.) This may be another such case. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has looked vulnerable but now beats Angle in the polls. South Carolina Republican gubernatorial primary. One more adultery charge and Nikki Haley would have the nomination locked up. In the last three weeks, two men have alleged affairs with her. In that time, her standing with voters seems to have improved. According to a recent poll, only 13 percent of voters believe the allegations about Haley's marital infidelity. The difference between Lowden in Nevada and Haley may be that there's tape of Lowden making her comment about chickens but no proof at all of the charges against Haley. She has vigorously denied the allegations and promised to resign once elected if either man--one a blogger and one a lobbyist--comes forward with proof of their accusations (though one has taken a polygraph in an attempt to show he's not lying). Though the state is known for its gutter-style politics, none of Haley's opponents has really pressed the adultery allegations. Still, the state has boobs aplenty: Jake Knotts, a state senator who supports one of her opponents, called Haley, who is of Indian decent, a ""raghead."" This may only be the end of the first episode of the reality show. If no candidate gets 50 percent of the vote, Republicans will hold a runoff on June 22. (See Arkansas.) California Republican gubernatorial and senatorial primaries. If the polls are right, California Republicans are going to nominate two female ex-CEO candidates to run for senate and governor. For the privilege of running this bankrupt state, former eBay CEO Meg Whitman, who has spent more than $81 million so far--$71 million from her personal fortune--will face Democrat and former Gov. Jerry Brown. In the Senate race, if Carly Fiorina beats her more moderate Republican opponent, Tom Campbell, she will set up the highest-profile contest between two female candidates in the history of American politics. It will be an ideologically sharp battle. Fiorina, is incumbent Sen. Barbara Boxer's polar opposite on abortion, gun control, offshore drilling, immigration, and Sarah Palin.

12	12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/06/heads_may_roll.html	"Now that the latest attempt to plug the Deepwater Horizon oil well has failed, public attention is turning to less technical matters: whether Obama is angry enough. Whether the federal government is doing enough. And what kind of cruel and unusual punishment should befall BP executives. Attorney General Eric Holder gave the first hints of criminal penalties for BP at a press conference in New Orleans on Tuesday. There, he promised to ""prosecute to the full extent any violations of the law."" He declined to name specific charges but said that the Department of Justice would be reviewing the Clean Water Act, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Endangered Species Act, and ""other traditional criminal statutes"" presumably related to manslaughter, since 11 people died in the initial explosion of the well. But will that be enough? Probably not, judging by past incidents. Even if Holder successfully prosecutes BP and the other companies involved in the spill, anyone looking for catharsis is likely to be disappointed. History suggests that the price paid by companies for environmental disasters is rarely as much as what the government and private parties seek. The best example, and the likely precedent for any Gulf litigation, is the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989. In civil cases, courts initially held Exxon liable for $5 billion in damages to Alaskan fisheries and other businesses. After a 20-year battle, that sum was cut to $500,000, or about $15,000 per fisherman. (Exxon did pay a separate settlement of $900 million for state and local governments that responded to the spill.) A grand jury indicted Exxon on five criminal violations, and a U.S. attorney said Exxon faced $600 million in fines. But the oil giant ended up paying only $100 million. The ship's captain, meanwhile, was accused of being drunk at the helm but was acquitted of all felony charges and didn't go to jail. (He did have to pay a $50,000 fine for a misdemeanor.) ""Ask people in Alaska and they'll say Exxon has paid maybe 10 percent of what was suffered,"" says Zygmunt Plater, a professor at Boston College Law School who worked for the state of Alaska's oil spill task force after the Exxon Valdez incident. Other environmental disasters show a similar pattern: The government and private parties seek high damages, then settle for--or are forced to accept--less. After thousands of workers were killed by a leak in a pesticide plant in Bhopal, India, in 1984, the government initially claimed $3 billion from Union Carbide, the company responsible. Union Carbide ended up paying $470 million in civil and criminal penalties. BP has gotten off easy, too. After the 2005 explosion at a Texas refinery run by BP that killed 15 people and injured 180, the company had to pay a $50 million fine, which attorneys for victims called ""trivial."" When a BP pipeline leaked more than 200,000 gallons of oil in Alaska in 2006, the company paid a total of $20 million in fines. That said, the Gulf spill could break the pattern. One reason is its size. Whereas the Exxon Valdez spilled a total of 250,000 barrels, the Deepwater Horizon well may have already leaked upward of 500,000 barrels and is still pumping out an estimated 19,000 barrels a day. If BP fails to siphon off the oil or create a relief well, oil could leak for months. That means more economic and environmental damage near a coastline that's significantly more populated than Alaska's. It also means criminal penalties will likely be much higher than in the Exxon case, because in many cases the size of a fine increases with the amount of pollution. Those fines have also gone up in recent years. For example, the Clean Water Act now carries civil penalties for oil spills of up to $4,300 per barrel in cases of gross negligence--which, if the well is leaking 19,000 barrels a day, could cost BP $82 million a day for months of spillage. And finally, there's an increased willingness by courts to consider non-economic natural-resource damages. ""We will make certain that those responsible clean up the mess they have made and restore or replace the natural resources lost or injured in this tragedy,"" said Holder on Tuesday. But what if they can't be replaced? There are many different ways to calculate noneconomic damages, and techniques such as ""ecosystem valuation"" (thinking of environmental systems holistically) and ""contingent valuation"" (asking people how much they'd be willing to pay to preserve a natural resource) are more accepted now than they were in the early 1990s. The resulting fines could be enormous. ""If I were the BP board of directors and someone said to me, 'For $20 billion, we'll give you complete absolution,' I'd fall over myself to sign that check,"" says Plater. Environmental law gives the government a lot of discretion when it comes to penalties, according to Jodi Freeman, a professor of environmental law at Harvard University. So it really comes down to how aggressive the administration wants to be. So far, Holder appears serious. ""Government has become more willing to consider knocking heads with criminal provisions,"" says Freeman. Whether those penalties match the public's outcry for punishment is ultimately subjective. Even if Holder were to string up BP CEO Tony Hayward by his thumbs in Times Square and give every American a tomato, it may not be sufficient. (Oil execs probably won't see jail time.) Maximum catharsis is also unlikely for logistical reasons. The administration may be suing the pants off BP for years to come, but in the near term it's also depending on the company to clean things up. That won't stop Holder from pursuing the legal case against BP. But it could cause the administration to tamp down its anti-BP rhetoric in the interests of cooperation. The timeline of environmental lawsuits works against the plaintiffs, too. It took 20 years for the Exxon Valdez case to reach the Supreme Court, by which time outrage had cooled. People looking for catharsis on the Gulf spill will also have to wait, especially considering that we don't know what happened yet. By the time BP lawyers have exited their last courtroom, some other crisis will no doubt have taken its place. Slate V: BP's Blame Game Become a fan of  Slateon Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/06/getting_out_of_the_box.html	"How do we judge a president in crisis? There are those things about the Gulf oil spill for which Obama is blamed but for which he and the administration are not at fault, like the inability to stop the flow of oil. There are those things for which he is responsible but not at fault, like the long nightmare of federal bureaucracy that allowed the technology for deep-water drilling to get so far ahead of the technology to stop a leak or clean it up. Then there are those things for which he is responsible and for which he can be at fault--like the success of the cleanup. These different strands have gotten all mixed up. In part, that's because politicians and partisans--on both sides--make this all more confusing. The president's opponents want him to be on the hook for not being able to stop the flow of oil so that every time you look at those images you get irritated at him. This is not only unfair, it's illogical: As the president said at Thursday's press conference, the government doesn't have the expertise to plug the leak. But the president's supporters play their part, too. They'd like the story to be all about BP's inability to stop the flow of oil. Focusing on BP's incompetence detracts from the story of the cleanup, on which Obama and his administration should be judged. Partisans make judging the story of the cleanup difficult, too. They would like to blame Obama for all the sins that predate the disaster: the lack of planning for such a nightmare and the delays and inefficiencies that have followed. This is a little fairer than blaming him for not finding the ""Press Here To Turn Off Flow of Oil"" switch--but barely. It's been a rather busy presidency--two wars, economic collapse, major legislative battles, etc. Is it really reasonable or realistic to think that Obama should have also taken time to completely rethink the regulatory scheme governing deep-water wells and the government's level of preparedness in the case of their failure? No need to answer that: Of course it's not. All the same, Obama is vulnerable on this issue because he embraced a policy that called for more off-shore drilling about 20 days before the spill. This president prides himself on thinking through his policies and testing his subordinates' assumptions. Yet according to sympathetic environmental experts, Obama trusted oil companies more than he should have, a mistake he has admitted. Still, all of this blame-fixing relates to behavior before the spill happened. The president's greatest exposure is on decisions he made after learning about the spill. On that front, the White House has been working hard to show that the president has been engaged from the beginning. Pundits have seized on the idea that he hasn't been sufficiently emotive. He needs to show more anger and empathy. In his press conference and in his visit to the region, he has been working hard to show these qualities. This is all valid--to a point. The theater of the presidency is important, even if some people would prefer otherwise. So another conversation about Obama's cool professorial demeanor is not entirely unexpected (or entirely unhelpful). The bigger problem, however, is not the theater; it's the substance. And it's here that the president's response seems most lacking. Wait, administration officials would point out. Obama had an emergency meeting in the Oval Office before it was even disclosed that any oil was leaking. Since the leak, the White House has been sending daily updates on all of the measures have been taken to respond to the historic spill. But the substantive and political question in the end may not be the speed of the response but the smarts of it. Federal officials who have been in big crises all talk about a moment when someone figured that the answer was not to apply more of the same remedy (or even ""historic"" amounts of it) but to look for an entirely new approach altogether. This sounds great in theory, but is very hard to do in the moment because the immediate needs take up 25 hours of the day. There's no time to think, and even if you have a great idea, there may be no organizational capacity to carry it out. There's also the problem that every hour someone spends on your creative idea is an hour they're not spending producing outputs that can be measured by the media and your political opponents. Also, creative ideas open you to ridicule. Why are you wasting your time on that and not ordering more boom? The Obama administration has a playbook it can follow, but the question is knowing when to rip up the playbook and start anew.  When I asked the president's top environmental adivser Carol Browner this Sunday about tearing up the playbook, she said the administration had been improvising all along, but her answers were about reacting to the failures to cap the well. * There has not yet been that moment in the federal response when an observer might think, This is something new. The solutions the administration is offering mostly feel incremental. There's a leak in the roof, the feds say. Bring more buckets. Why not: There's a leak--let's punch a hole in the roof to keep it from spreading. Bringing in supertankers to vacuum up the oil is the kind of solution that seems different. (BP officials say supertankers won't work because the oil from this spill is too spread-out.) There is a political benefit to showing innovative thinking even if it yields modest results. Voters knew Obama wasn't an emotive guy when they elected him. But there was the theory that he and his smart team would follow a process that would yield answers. He would engage smart people, build consensus, avert the perceptual narrowing that comes with crisis and find a new way. The Obama administration wouldn't just flip through the existing playbook faster--it would know when to rewrite the playbook on the fly. Administration officials repeatedly say the ""best minds"" are working on the issue, but even if that's really true, the problem is that innovation runs on a different clock than the news cycle. Before the big idea arrives, you can hardly call in the cameras for a shot of the smart guys in a room breaking their pencils. Energy Secretary Stephen Chu seems to be the best place to look so far. He used gamma rays to help focus on the extent of the damage to the blowout preventer. In other quarters there's also brainstorming that might lead to a spark. For example, federal officials are now talking to  Titanic director James Cameron. None of this is to argue that innovation equals success. But in judging the administration and its response, one category worth watching is how innovative its thinking is. Often it's a quality that makes the difference between greatness and mere competence. Correction,  June 2, 2010: The piece originally and incorrectly stated that Carol Browner was the head of the EPA. She held that job under President Clinton.

14	14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/05/bystanderinchief.html	"The vocabulary of oil drilling is so colorful--junk shot, top kill,  poor boy degasser--that there must be a name for the trick President Obama was trying to pull off at his press conference Thursday. He was trying to take responsibility and show that his administration is in control of efforts to stop and contain the massive oil spill in the Gulf. At the same time, he had to admit that the government hasn't always been competent, lacks resources, and is only kinda sorta in charge. Whatever the term would be, it would include mud. ""In case anybody wonders, in any of your reporting, in case you were wondering who's responsible, I take responsibility,"" said the president in his concluding remarks. But it's responsibility with an asterisk: BP is the only entity that can solve this problem, which is like none anyone has seen before. The government can stare harder over the oil company's shoulder--order a second relief well to be drilled, tell it what kind of chemicals to use--but overall the relationship is not unlike that between a frustrated user and his computer. The federal government is stuck on the phone, and BP is tech support. Having responsibility without control is always a horrible situation, no matter what job you hold. But Obama and his aides know it is a special gift of the presidency. The dynamic is part of what keeps the ""This is Obama's Katrina"" story line alive, and the sense of confusion that dogged the Bush administration after Katrina was only heightened at the press conference when Obama said he didn't know whether the director of the Minerals Management Service had been fired or had resigned. When asked directly about the Katrina comparison, Obama deferred to the judgment of history, sounding like his predecessor did when he was asked those kinds of questions. ""When the problem is solved and people look back and do an assessment of all the various decisions that were made, I think people can make a historical judgment,"" he said. ""And I'm confident that people are going to look back and say that this administration was on top of what was an unprecedented crisis."" Katrina was so damaging for Bush because he seemed so disconnected from the emergency he faced. This was exacerbated by the famous photo of him flying over the disaster. More damaging, but less remembered, is video footage of a pre-storm planning meeting in which he did not ask a single question of his briefers as they told him of the approaching disaster. Obama's intent today was to show that the government was doing whatever it could, and had been from the start. After learning of the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig, Obama asked that departments respond quickly to help with rescue efforts and determine the environmental fallout. ""The day that the rig collapsed and fell to the bottom of the ocean, I had my team in the Oval Office that first day,"" he said. ""Those who think that we were either slow on our response or lacked urgency don't know the facts."" He outlined administration efforts to close the well, clean up, and put pressure on BP to pay claims. He announced a series of regulatory changes to prevent similar disasters. He ordered work suspended on exploratory drilling in the gulf and cancelled or deferred some future wells elsewhere around the country. ""Not a day goes by where the federal government is not constantly thinking about how do we make sure that we minimize the damage on this, we close this thing down, we review what happened to make sure that it does not happen again,"" he said. The president wasn't focused on politics, he said, but was trying to get the hole plugged and focus on the disaster. (In contrast, the Republican National Senatorial Committee was focused on politics and released a video immediately after the press conference that charged Obama with half measures on a host of national crises.) But Obama was concerned enough about politics to do all he could from behind a podium to show that he understands that people are frustrated. He repeatedly expressed his empathy with locals. ""Every day I see this leak continue, I am angry and frustrated as well."" He touched on his personal experiences. ""In Hawaii the ocean is sacred."" He even enlisted his family, describing how his daughter Malia interrupted his morning shave with a question: ""Did you plug the hole yet, Daddy?"" If one of the failures of the previous administration was a reluctance to admit mistakes, then this one has learned from its predecessor. At several points Obama admitted his administration had fallen short--while being at pains to point out that it was not through a lack of effort. It should have pushed BP earlier for an accurate assessment of the size of the leak. If MMS had been functioning properly, the disaster might have been avoided. At Obama's news conference in April 2009, he recited all of the things on his plate--from auto and bank bailouts to wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to his (then unpassed) health care legislation. He even gave advice on how to cough, in advance of a possible H1N1 epidemic. That was a disaster that didn't hit but for which the government had prepared. Now, with a plate filled with a set of new problems (new except for the hardy perennials of the last decade, Afghanistan and Iraq), the president must deal with one no one saw coming: the largest oil spill in U.S. history. ""We've gone through a difficult year and a half,"" he said. ""This is just one more bit of difficulty.""

15	15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/07/could_republicans_take_the_house.html	"When Robert Gibbs said on Meet the Press that Democrats could lose the House of Representatives, Republicans jumped on the remarks. ""The fact that the Obama White House is acknowledging that there is even a possibility that Democrats could lose their majority in the House should be read as a tacit admission that their economic policies have failed in the eyes of the voters,"" said Ken Spain, the Republican Congressional Committee's communications director. Matt Drudge also highlighted Gibbs' remarks. Did Gibbs let slip one of those truths that everyone in Washington knows but that as the president's spokesman is not supposed to admit? No. He merely articulated the White House political strategy. To commit a gaffe, as Michael Kinsley defined it, is to accidentally tell the truth. It is true (or at least common wisdom) that Republicans have a shot at winning the House. Historically, presidents often lose seats in the first election after being inaugurated. After two election cycles of Democratic gains, there are a high number of vulnerable seats in Republican territory. (Of the 28 seats in CQ's tossup category, 25 are currently held by Democrats.) The economic recovery is anemic, and voters want to throw out the incumbents, most of whom are Democrats. But if Gibbs had committed a gaffe in the Kinsleyian sense, he'd have shared a truth that goes unspoken. While Gibbs had never previously put it exactly as he did on Sunday, his boss has been raising the specter of a Republican majority for months. In May, the president warned that if Republicans took over Congress, they would repeal the just-passed health care law. He added that they'd drive the country's economy into the ditch again, as they did last time they were in control. ""The American people will have a choice about whether or not we're going to keep rebuilding [an] America that is stronger and more prosperous,"" Obama said at Democratic fundraiser in New York, ""or going back to the policies that got us into this mess in the first place."" He has repeated those remarks since then, including at two events last week in Missouri and Nevada. In a campaign where neither party benefits much from positive messages and where the Democratic base is dispirited and less enthusiastic than its counterparts, fear is the best motivator. Since Sarah Palin isn't running for anything this time around, the best specter the president has to conjure is Republicans in control of Congress. (Obama isn't the only one using fear to energize voters. Palin's much-discussed new ad looks soft and sounds empowering, but the underlying message is that the Democrats are a malevolent force.) This is not the time for Obama to embrace his trademark penchant for complexity by admitting there's a solid case to be made that  Republicans won't win back the House. Instead, he has jumped on every Republican gaffe to help him put on the fright show. When Rep. Joe Barton apologized to BP for the White House pressure that led to the $20 billion fund to pay oil-spill claims, Gibbs pointed out that if Republicans take control, Barton would be in charge of the committee that helps shape energy policy. When Republican Minority Leader John Boehner seemed to compare the financial crisis to an insect, Obama and his aides seized on that, too. Gibbs was was also trying to set expectations. Obama's party is on track to lose in the midterms. If Gibbs and fellow Democrats can make retaking Congress the standard by which Republican gains are judged, they shape the coverage of election night. If Republicans win big but don't take control of Congress, reporters might write fewer words about how the loss was a huge defeat for the president. Just because Gibbs is working a strategy doesn't mean Republican political operatives were dumb to make an issue of the comment. That's what campaign committees of both parties do. They overreact in the hopes that flipping out will catch on with their bases. There's a chance that less-hardcore voters might pay attention, too. What's an obvious ""truth"" to Washington insiders isn't so obvious to the rest of the country. And they have reason to celebrate. The White House does not take this approach because it is in a position of strength. Eighteen months ago, after the Obama victory, the GOP was declared dead. Time magazine put the GOP elephant on the cover with the headline ""Endangered Species."" The NRCC's Spain pointed this out in his third e-mail in 24 hours on Gibbs' remarks. The White House is trying to energize its own voters, but the other side is getting pretty excited, too. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter."

16	16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/07/the_new_commander.html	"Gen. James Mattis has been joking recently that after 41 years in the Marines, he was going to return to his home of Walla Walla, Wash., to become an onion farmer. He'll have to wait. The four-star general is going to Tampa, Fla., to take over for Army Gen. David Petraeus as commander of the U.S. Central Command, overseeing combat in both Afghanistan and Iraq. The news was announced by Defense Secretary Robert Gates at a press conference today. Mattis now faces a Senate confirmation. Mattis, who I profiled for my series on risk-takers, is currently the commander of the Joint Forces Command in Norfolk, Va., where he helps the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines fight in coordination. He commanded Marines as a brigadier general in Afghanistan in 2001. In 2003, he was the Marine ground commander in Iraq, leading the 20,000 troops of the 1st Marine Division for 500 miles over 17 days, the longest sustained march in Marine Corps history. He then returned to fight in Al-Anbar province in 2003 during the toughest period of combat. He was considered the front-runner to be named commandant of the Marine Corps but was passed over for that post several weeks ago. It was a disappointment for Mattis. With few spots for someone of his rank, his only real option was to retire. Still, it was inconceivable to those around the energetic 59-year-old that after a lifetime in the service he would be leaving. Then Gen. Stanley McChrystal's career abruptly ended, and Mattis' fortunes were reversed. When President Obama named Petraeus to replace McChrystal in Afghanistan, he signaled that he was not retreating from the counterinsurgency (COIN) strategy, with its emphasis on quick adaptation and winning over the population through a reduction in force. Petraeus was one of the two generals behind Field Manual 3-24, Counterinsurgency, that outlined the doctrine. Mattis was the other. ""The two generals established an impressive rapport based on their shared understanding of the conduct of counterinsurgency and of the urgent need to reform their services to make them more capable of conducting this most difficult kind of war,"" wrote John Nagl, a member of the manual's writing team and author of  Learning To Eat Soup With a Knife, a key text in the counterinsurgency canon. Mattis is known for his ferocity and his risk-taking--which included regularly riding out into combat with his jump platoon, despite his high rank. (That's something he'll probably have to give up now.) He is also known for his intellect. He is well-read in history and military strategy but has also studied innovation and adaptation techniques. Mattis is also known for his mouth. He is a jokester in person and also blunt. In the spring of 2003, in the first of his meetings with recently defeated Iraqi military leaders he famously said: ""I come in peace. I didn't bring artillery. But I'm pleading with you, with tears in my eyes: If you fuck with me, I'll kill you all."" In a speech in 2005, when describing the atrocities committed by some members of the Taliban, he said, ""It was fun to shoot some people."" You might think elevating this kind of general a risk for the president. After all, didn't McChrystal's mouth get him fired? But these quotes are of a different order than the ones from McChrystal in Rolling Stone, and among the troops, the Mattis quotes they repeat emphasize more than just force. ""No better friend, no worse enemy,"" he wrote his troops before they embarked on the 2003 invasion of Iraq. When he returned to Al-Anbar, he added to that set of instructions, ""First do no harm."" In this new post, Mattis will have to be a diplomat, working with NATO allies and countries in the region, most notably Pakistan. President Obama was concerned about this element of the job when evaluating Mattis and brought it up at their meeting. He comes to the job with experience. While fighting the insurgency in Iraq, Mattis held countless meetings with local leaders, in keeping with counterinsurgency doctrine's emphasis on diplomacy over force. In his latest post, he also served for two years as NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Transformation with an office in Brussels. While working on my profile of Mattis for my series on risk-taking, I listened in on a speech he gave to newly minted one-star officers in which he extolled the value and virtues of building ""harmony and trust"" within a coalition. His longest story was not about valor, bravery, and daring but about negotiating with Pakistani officials in preparation for the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. Another point Mattis emphasized in his talk was that great officers are defined by their ability to adapt to surprises. Last week, the career of a four-star general unexpectedly came to an end. This week, the career of another four-star general, which was supposed to be coming to an end, will unexpectedly continue. Mattis has been given his surprise.

17	17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/07/earth_to_conservatives.html	"Washington, we have a problem. First, President Barack Obama whittled NASA down to a research center that oversees private space flight. Now he appears to have turned it into a subdivision of the State Department. On a visit to Cairo last week, NASA chief Charles Bolden gave an interview to Al-Jazeera in which he said that Obama charged him with three missions: to ""re-inspire children to want to get into science and math,"" to ""expand our international relationships,"" and, ""perhaps foremost, he wanted me to find a way to reach out to the Muslim world and engage much more with dominantly Muslim nations to help them feel good about their historic contribution to science, math, and engineering."" Conservatives were not over the moon. On Fox News, Charles Krauthammer called Bolden's comments ""a new height of fatuousness. NASA was established to get America into space and to keep us there. This idea of 'to feel good about your past scientific achievements' is the worst kind of group therapy, psycho-babble, imperial condescension and adolescent diplomacy."" At National Review Online's The Corner, Victor Davis Hanson questioned whether it's ""really the business of a government scientific agency to produce historical and scientific narratives for political purposes."" Hot Air's Ed Morrissey argued that ""Muslim nations should be insulted by the idea that the US pays NASA to provide them with paternalistic and patronizing validation and self-esteem boosts. And they probably will be."" Damage control ensued. A NASA spokesman told ABC that Bolden ""understands that NASA's core mission is exploration."" The White House threaded the two themes together, emphasizing that NASA should ""engage with the world's best scientists and engineers as we work together to push the boundaries of exploration,"" including outreach to ""many Muslim-majority countries."" Bolden chose his words poorly when he said the goal was to make Muslim nations ""feel good."" But his statement revealed a truth about NASA that's rarely articulated by public officials: One of its main missions is now--and always has been--public relations. When NASA was first created in 1958, it served several purposes. The United States and the Soviet Union were engaged in a Cold War, so the space race was partly about defense--whoever controlled the skies controlled the world. But it was also symbolic: Landing on the moon before the Soviets represented the triumph of American technology and innovation. It was also an opportunity for the United States to win fans across the globe. There's a reason Neil Armstrong didn't call the moon landing one giant leap for the United States of America. Ever since that first trip to the moon, though, NASA has struggled to justify its existence. There's still the defense justification: The only reason we're not speaking Russian now is that we didn't let the Soviets overtake us in space technology. But the real battleground has always been in the troposphere, not the thermosphere. There's the more benign scientific explanation: NASA pioneered breakthroughs in areas from experimental aircraft to satellite communications. Who knows what it may discover next? But it takes a lot of taxpayer money. There's also the romantic justification. In 2004, George W. Bush tried to recapture the glory of the 1960s by outlining a vision for astronauts to return to the moon by 2020. *  ""Mankind is drawn to the heavens for the same reason we were once drawn into unknown lands and across the open sea,"" he said at the time. ""We choose to explore space because doing so improves our lives and lifts the national spirit."" Even Obama invoked President Kennedy's moon shot during the 2008 campaign as an example of American industriousness. But again, $19 billion is a lot to spend on mechanical poetry. That leaves the diplomacy justification. The Shuttle-Mir Program, a U.S.-Russia collaboration announced in 1993, fostered good relations between former rivals. The International Space Station was another opportunity for cooperation with Russia, Japan, and the European Space Agency. Obama puts even more emphasis on international relations. An administration report on national space policy released last week promises that exploration projects will help ""all nations and peoples--space-faring and space-benefiting."" It also assures allies that ""there shall be no national claims of sovereignty over outer space or any celestial bodies."" In more concrete terms, the administration's current plans for human space travel--a stop by an asteroid by 2025, followed by an eventual (and still very hypothetical) trip to Mars--would likely include other nations, and U.S. officials have reportedly reached out to China about joint space efforts. In context, using NASA to reach out to the Muslim world doesn't sound all that crazy. Bolden may have put that goal in patronizing terms. But the core idea--that space efforts represent an opportunity for cooperation with countries in the Middle East--is a compelling one. Iran has a space program, as do Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. Inviting them to join the International Space Station or to collaborate on bilateral projects would be win-win. That becomes difficult, of course, when administrations keep whittling away NASA's annual budget, which now stands at a measly $19 billion--a tiny slice of the Defense Department's $708 billion allotment. Perhaps the State Department can throw in a few extra billion. Correction, July 7, 2010: This article originally stated that President Bush launched the Constellation program in 2004. That was the year he outlined his ""Vision for Space Exploration."" The Constellation program was authorized in 2005. (Return to the corrected sentence.) Like Slate on Facebook.

Politicians deliberately wait to put out bad news on a trash day because, the theory goes, so few people are paying attention. Today Michael Steele, the Republican Party chairman, is testing that hypothesis. He's in trouble again for his remarks, this time for his suggestion that Afghanistan was ""a war of Obama's choosing"" and was ""not something the United States had actively prosecuted or wanted to engage in."" In response, Bill Kristol, the editor of the Weekly Standard, has called for Steele to step down. Saturday, Liz Cheney, chairwoman of Keep America Safe, joined him in calling for Steele to resign. Steele's remarks, made at a Connecticut fundraiser for congressional candidates, were surreptitiously recorded by a progressive activist and posted on YouTube. Steele said President Obama was obligated to pursue the war in Afghanistan because during the campaign against John McCain, he demonized the Bush administration's handling of Iraq, which meant when he took office he had to make good on his boasts. ""Well, if he is such a student of history,"" said Steele, ""has he not understood that you know that's the one thing you don't do, is engage in a land war in Afghanistan?"" Steele also said he found the recent ouster of Gen. Stanley McChrystal ""comical"" because it reflected the military's distrust in Obama's strategy. Obviously as a factual matter Steele is incorrect. George Bush started the war in Afghanistan. (This he should know since he attacked John Kerry for not adequately funding the war at the 2004 GOP convention.) But there is also a matter of opinion here, and that's what's getting Steele in even more trouble. By suggesting a land war in Afghanistan is dumb, Steele is putting himself in the minority of his party, which has been largely supportive of the conflict. Just this week, Senate Republicans voted unanimously to approve Gen. David Petraeus to replace McChrystal and prosecute that war. Indeed, most Republicans support an extension of the conflict, asking the president to reconsider his July 2011 date for the beginning of a troop withdrawal. Democratic Party operatives said Steele's statement put him ""at odds with about 100 percent of the Republican Party."" Kristol added: ""At a time when Gen. Petraeus has just taken over command, when Republicans in Congress are pushing for a clean war funding resolution, when Republicans around the country are doing their best to rally their fellow citizens behind the mission, your comment is more than an embarrassment. It's an affront, both to the honor of the Republican Party and to the commitment of the soldiers fighting to accomplish the mission they've been asked to take on by our elected leaders."" This is the latest in a string of GOP gaffes and minigaffes over the last three weeks that Democrats are trying to exploit. Two weeks ago, Rep. Joe Barton, the ranking Republican on the energy and commerce committee, apologized to BP. Earlier this week, Minority Leader John Boehner picked a bad metaphor in attacking the White House-backed Wall Street reform. He said the bill was like ""killing an ant with a nuclear weapon,"" causing Democrats to make excited claims that Boehner believed in his heart that the economic collapse was as insignificant as an ant. (Boehner's spokesman--coincidentally named Michael Steel--later clarified that his boss was ""not minimizing the crisis America faced."") Obama used both examples in a speech Wednesday arguing that the Republican Party is out of touch. Steele contributes to that storyline and adds to a potentially more powerful one: These three men aren't GOP back-benchers or conservative talk show hosts, Democrats argue. They're the leaders of the party--the kind of men who would be in power if the Republicans take control of Congress in November. The White House and Democratic officials were anxious to highlight Steele's remarks Friday for another reason. It helped obscure jobs data that showed the economy limping along. Though the economy produced 83,000 private sector jobs last month, the economy lost 125,000 jobs overall, mostly because of fewer Census jobs. That was the first decline in six months. (As Ben Smith of Politico noted, by midday the Democratic National Committee had sent out 26 emails about Steele and only one about jobs.) Of course, there is always a danger of making too much of Steele's remarks. In fact, if there's any real fallout from this latest gaffe, it will upend one of Washington's most durable propositions: that Michael Steele can say or do anything and still keep his job. He offended talk show host Rush Limbaugh, called abortion an ""individual choice"" though he had previously said he was pro-life, said Republicans probably wouldn't win back the House, and has been criticized for excessive spending. (And then there are the intern photos.) Still, he has been able to keep his post because--while there have been calls for his resignation before--it is very hard to remove him if he doesn't want to go. Firing him would require a two-thirds vote of the 168 voting RNC members. His term is up in January anyway, and ousting him before then would require a messy effort to convince those who voted for him before to remove him early. That would be a protracted and public fiasco just as Republicans should be focusing on an election that still looks good for their candidates. In response to the flap, Steele issued a statement supporting Obama's troop increase, Gen. Petraeus and calling for success in Afghanistan. RNC spokesman Doug Heye also issued a statement that   gave no suggestion Steele was backing off, saying that Steele supported the war but remains critical of Obama's inability to articulate the mission. Advice on the articulate presentation of ideas is also advice Steele might want to take himself. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter."

Pretty impressive work for what one historian famously described as ""American Scripture"" and what the National Archives calls""the nation's most cherished symbol of liberty."" Then again, it's only 1,300 words or so, approximately 8,000 characters. In other words, three-and-a-half tweets a day. Which got us to thinking: If Jefferson were writing the Declaration of Independence today, he'd probably tweet it @kinggeorge3. He was also only 33 years old when he wrote it, about the age of the average Twitter user, and there is evidence he liked cool gadgets with which to express himself. And as he once said, ""The most valuable of all talents is that of never using two words when one will do."" (Still 57 characters left, Mr. President!) So here is our challenge to Slatereaders: Condense the Declaration of Independence to one tweet. For example: ""All men should be equal, happy and free. Suck it, King George. We quit. Love, the U.S. of A."" Or maybe: ""All men are free. Also: No more quartering of troops."" Reduce the document to what you see as its essence.

His replacement will have an even harder task: Doing the same for deficit reduction. Reducing the deficit is the Washington equivalent of eating one's vegetables. It's preached mainly by stern fogies, who don't make it sound very appetizing. Whoever replaces Orszag as director of the Office of Management and Budget--the top names floated so far are Clinton administration vets Laura Tyson and Gene Sperling--will have to change that. It's not that deficit reduction hasn't been on the administration's to-do list. It just hasn't been a priority. President Obama first had to tackle the financial crisis, which required a deficit-ballooning stimulus package. We'll get to deficit reduction, the thinking went. Let's just fix this crisis thing first. Health care reform included elements of deficit reduction--nearly every presidential speech mentioned ""bending the cost curve""--but balancing the budget wasn't its main goal. The recession is by no means over. But every step toward recovery brings the tough choices of budget balancing that much closer. Even if Orszag's successor doesn't preside over gigantic federal cutbacks, he'll at least have to formulate a game plan. ""There's no question that the single biggest issue on the plate of the OMB director is going to be addressing the long-term deficit situation,"" says Michael Ettlinger, an economic policy expert at the Center for American Progress. The numbers are getting uglier by the month. The annual deficit currently hovers at $1.6 trillion. The overall federal debt, meanwhile, stands at $13 trillion. Projections over the next 10 years show the total debt growing by another $9 trillion. The good news is that the hardest part is over--maybe. Entitlements make up the biggest part of the projected budget gap, and Medicare is the biggest entitlement. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes all kinds of cost-cutting measures, from the independent commission that would trim Medicare expenses to savings resulting from competition in the exchanges to comparative effectiveness research. The problem is, we don't know whether these measures will work, and we won't know for sure for several years. (The recent CBO announcement that health care reform will cost $115 billion more than originally projected wasn't encouraging.) There are plenty of other ways to cut the deficit, but none of them is pretty. Most economists agree that Social Security will be insolvent by 2037. One way to boost revenue would be to raise the retirement age. Less drastic would be to simply slow the growth in benefits. That doesn't mean cutting benefits from where they are now, says Isabel Sawhill, a budget expert at the Brookings Institution. It just means reducing the amount that future retirees receive, which is linked to rising wages. Another option is cutting discretionary, or nonentitlement, spending, which made up 35 percent of the 2010 budget. The Obama administration recently called for federal agencies to cut their budgets by 5 percent. It's a drop in the ocean of overall spending--but the ocean is made of drops. If there's going to be significant discretionary spending cut, it's going to be on the military side. Military dollars are sacrosanct in Washington. But there is fat to be trimmed: A panel convened by Rep. Barney Frank recently recommended nearly $1 trillion in defense cuts. Then there's everyone's favorite: Raising taxes. Allowing the top-bracket Bush tax cuts to expire is just the first step. After that, most economists agree that there's no balancing the budget without raising taxes on the middle class. Obama has boxed himself in by promising not to raise taxes on American families that make less than $250,000 a year. To eliminate deficits, he would probably need to break his promise--which means we might not see changes in his tax policy until after 2012. Obama is already laying the groundwork for deficit reduction. But the political obstacles are formidable. The leaders of his much touted bipartisan deficit commission say that all options are on the table. But a testy exchange between co-chair Alan Simpson and a liberal activist last week showed how difficult it will be to find common ground. It doesn't help that the only long-term solutions--cutting entitlements and raising taxes--are considered political hara-kiri. ""It's not like we don't know what to do,"" says Sawhill. ""The problem is we're not willing to do it."" In the absence of a real crisis, it's hard to persuade Americans to swallow policies they don't like. The job of the next OMB director will therefore be to convince Americans that the long-term deficit is a crisis. Polls suggest it's not a tough sell. One recent survey found that half of Americans consider the current federal deficit a ""crisis,"" while another 43 percent think it's ""a major problem."" The challenge is getting them to accept the painful remedies necessary to fix it. Become a fan of  Slate  on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

21	21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/06/buried_treasure_everywhere.html	"For years, the mining industry has known that there are vast supplies of lithium, an element that is crucial to the technology business, sitting untapped under one of the world's most impoverished countries. Optimistic reports rave that its resources are so abundant that the country could become ""the Saudi Arabia of lithium."" But there are some serious problems--like an unpredictable political situation and deplorable infrastructure--that are keeping potential investors at bay. And with the world's lithium supplies in solid shape, for now, that lithium will be staying put. That country is not Afghanistan. It is Bolivia. And as is the case in Bolivia, there won't be any lithium coming out of Afghanistan anytime soon. Much of the coverage that followed this New York Times story about Afghanistan's mineral reserves has been preoccupied with predicting whether Afghanistan's wealth will lead to an even more precarious political situation in the country. But that question presumes that there will be foreign interest in Afghanistan's mineral deposits. Afghanistan has been failing to cash in on its mineral wealth for years. Foreign investment has been shunning Afghanistan for about as long as geologists have been reporting on its riches. Bolivia--which, unlike Afghanistan, hasn't been at war for decades--is a prime example of why even enormous mineral wealth doesn't guarantee a mining industry. Lawrence Wright details all of the biggest obstacles to mining there in this March 2010 New Yorker feature about Bolivia's unlikely bid to become--yes--""the Saudi Arabia of lithium."" Its infrastructure is pathetic, and its erratic president, Evo Morales, who has a fondness for nationalizing industries without warning, makes the political situation less than encouraging. (He has demanded, for example, that companies that mine the lithium in Bolivia also make the batteries there.) And yet, from an investor's standpoint, Bolivia is a sure thing compared with Afghanistan. Afghanistan's mineral deposits are in one of the most dangerous regions of a country locked in a severely destabilizing war. To guard even a small mining operation in Afghanistan, says Jon Evans, a division manager for FMC Lithium, one of the world's top producers of lithium, ""you'd need to hire a private army, supported by coalition troops."" And Afghanistan, like Bolivia, is landlocked and lacks a reliable route to the sea. The deeper problem is that lithium, while valuable, isn't all that rare. There are plenty of lithium-rich areas that are much safer to mine than Afghanistan (or less of a headache to mine than Bolivia), including Finland, Australia, Serbia, Argentina, Chile, Canada, and the United States. As Brian Jaskula of the United States Geological Survey told Michael Reilly of Discovery News, ""We'll be extracting lithium from the ocean before we'll be extracting it from Afghanistan."" As a bonus, many of these places don't require immense infrastructure support. The high level of both risk and investment that would be required to mine in Afghanistan--is there any region of the country that doesn't suffer from rolling blackouts?--is enough to give pause to any investor eying Afghanistan's reserves, especially since those other reserves aren't running out any time soon. R. Keith Evans, a geologist who has worked in the lithium industry since the 1970s, estimated in 2009 that the world's known supply of lithium was more than enough to cover the world's demand. Of course, demand could spike. For the last decade there has been no shortage of predictions that Bolivia has a lucrative future in lithium once electric cars gain a larger share of the automotive market. But the industries that would make Bolivia's--and now Afghanistan's--lithium supplies essential haven't exactly taken off yet. The technology to make a lithium ion battery for a car that isn't bulky, heavy, expensive, and slower than a gasoline-powered car, notes Wright, is at least a few years away. By then, lithium could be discovered in vast supplies in other, safer areas. And Evans points out that very little is now known about the makeup of the lithium supplies in Afghanistan: Is it mixed with elements that will make it costly to extract, like Bolivia's magnesium-laced supplies? How widely dispersed is it? It's possible that geologists could find that Afghanistan's lithium troves are not as abundant as predicted, or in a form that will be expensive to mine. Still, even if one accepts the most optimistic predictions about the formation of an Afghanistan mining industry, worries about the prospect for violent infighting over Afghanistan's mineral riches--or lesser fears voiced by U.S. officials that China will edge out a nascent U.S. lithium mining interest in the region--are hugely premature. If and when a lithium mining industry exists in Afghanistan, investors and U.S. officials can worry about where the wealth goes, and those investors may well be Chinese. China has shown itself willing to invest in a risky area and run a copper mine in Afghanistan--but that mine, which is heavily guarded by coalition troops, doesn't pose the kind of security costs that would come with a new lithium mine and all of its infrastructure. In short, there are a lot of other what-ifs to worry about before anyone begins to fret that China is going to take something that the United States wants, or that lithium will make Afghanistan the Nigeria of lithium rather than the Saudi Arabia. It remains to be seen if Afghanistan's lithium can be extracted cheaply enough to be worth the enormous risk--to investors, to the country's politics, and, not incidentally, to the miners themselves.

22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/06/thejoe_and_tony_show.html	"Like most chief executives, BP CEO Tony Hayward has mastered the art of saying very little very carefully. At Thursday's hearing before a House committee, he delivered a spectacular performance, describing decisions he was not involved in, knowledge he did not have, conclusions he was unprepared to make, and judgments he was not ready to render. ""I am not a drilling engineer,"" he said at several points. ""I am not an oceanographic scientist,"" he said at another. ""I'm not a cement engineer, I'm afraid,"" he lamented. Even the people he brought with him were defined by what they didn't know. Before responding to one question, Hayward consulted with a technical adviser, then turned back to the microphone. The adviser was ""not a cement expert,"" so neither one of them could answer. If the purpose of congressional investigations is to expose and inform, then the purpose of congressional hearings is to obfuscate and entertain. Thursday's hearing--officially titled ""The Role of BP in the Deepwater Horizon Explosion and Oil Spill"" and featuring Hayward as the sole witness--did not disappoint. Like all great performers, however, Hayward had some help: the cast of the committee itself, most notably Rep. Joe Barton, who almost stole the show with his dramatic apology, retraction, and clarification. As usual, the opening statements helped the audience separate the heroes from the villains. Actually, in this hearing, everyone knew who the villain was. He was the heavy-lidded CEO sitting in the witness chair, wearing a double-vented navy blue suit. He knew his role: Show no emotion. Do not react. Just sit there and take it as each member of the committee competes to see who can give you more hell. Which is exactly what happened, for the most part. ""BP has been before this committee many times,"" said Rep. John Dingell, who has been in Congress since before Hayward was born and is the longest-serving member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. ""Rarely has it been a pleasant meeting."" Rep. Mike Doyle scolded Hayward for not doing his homework, for failing to answer the questions the committee asked him in a letter sent before the hearing. Rep. Mike Ross began his statement by announcing how many millions of gallons of oil had been spilled since the hearing started. (When it was his turn to ask questions, four hours later, Ross provided an update.) The glaring exception to this hate-in was Barton's apology for the Obama administration's ""shakedown"" of BP. This was not according to script. There was also an underappreciated moment of semi-support from Rep. Parker Griffith, who let it be known that, contrary to what several of his colleagues were saying, the oil spill was not the worst environmental disaster in American history. That would be ... cigarettes, which kill 60,000 Americans each year. New corporate slogan: ""BP: Not as Bad for You as Tobacco."" Once the questions finally began--more than two hours after the hearing started and after a protestor had been removed from the room--everyone's role clarified. The Republicans on the subcommittee, who number eight, think BP has been very bad. The Democrats, who number 13, think BP has been very, very bad. Hayward, who sat alone at the witness table, agrees that something very bad has happened. He's just not sure about  BP's part in it. He'd like to withhold judgment for the moment, thank you. Thus began several hours of quiet, polite evasiveness. Did BP cut corners on safety? ""I think it's too early to reach a conclusion on that,"" Hayward said. Has BP changed its practices? ""We've engaged in systematic change"" for several years. Could you please speak directly into the microphone? Thank you. Was this accident preventable? ""I believe all accidents are preventable."" Who is responsible for the failures of the rig? ""That is what our investigation is going to determine."" Is today Thursday? A trick question! ""It is Thursday,"" Hayward said, almost defensively. Through it all, Hayward remained unfazed, and his Britishisms--decisions are not made, they are ""taken""; BP does not try, it ""endeavors""--made him sound courteous. ""I realize that we speak the same language, but it's not always the same language,"" said Rep. Bruce Braley, eliciting an expressive blink from the witness. But Braley was not trying to understand Hayward; he was trying to make sure Hayward understood Barton. Did Hayward know the term ""shakedown""? Was he familiar with the phrase ""slush fund""? He may as well have asked, ""Can you believe this Barton guy?"" After his opening statement--in fact, shortly after 10 a.m.--Barton was conspicuously absent. He finally returned to the hearing at 3:08 p.m. with two cans of Diet Dr. Pepper and a lock of hair spilling over his forehead. He looked as if he was having a rough day. (He was.) Two minutes later, the photographers noticed him, and they all but drowned out Hayward--something about how ""BP operates to a global standard""--as they captured his arrival. When the chair recognized him a few moments later, his questions were subdued. You could tell his heart wasn't in it. By that time, there was bipartisan agreement on two matters: Barton had gone too far. And Hayward hadn't gone nearly far enough. Rep. Bart Stupak, the subcommittee's chairman, spoke for his colleagues when he told Hayward he was ""extremely frustrated with your lack of candor and inability to answer any questions."" It wasn't a question, so Hayward didn't respond. Like  Slate  on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	What we learned from Tony Hayward and Joe Barton at the BP hearings.

23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/06/live_from_the_oval_office.html	"President Obama will give his first address from the Oval Office Tuesday. A presidential speech from the Oval Office usually falls into one of two categories: The commander in chief is responding to an immediate crisis, or he is trying to change the dynamic of an ongoing one. In the first category, there is Ronald Reagan speaking after the Challenger explosion, George W. Bush addressing the nation the night of 9/11, and John F. Kennedy announcing  that National Guard troops had been sent to the University of Alabama to escort black students to school. Obama cannot give a speech of this sort. It's too late to be a dramatic first-responder. The oil has been leaking for 55 days (though it feels as if we've been watching the split screen since winter). Obama will have to give the second kind of speech, like the ones Richard Nixon gave about Vietnam and the economy, an issue also addressed from the Oval Office by Reagan and Bill Clinton. (Though presidents have used the venue sparingly, Reagan was a bit of a stage hog, giving dozens of addresses from there). The speeches in this category are not well-remembered because the problems are intractable and the solutions incremental. Obama will try to make his speech memorable by using his Oval Office address to argue for comprehensive energy legislation. What we won't know until after the speech is whether he'll breeze past the issue or take command of it. The Oval Office speech that Obama and every other president wants to avoid is the one Jimmy Carter gave on July 15, 1979. The topic was the national ""crisis of confidence,"" and his address came to be known as the ""malaise"" speech. (Carter never used that word; it was used in a White House memo describing the talk.) Though its frank tone and call for national sacrifice were initially well-received, its reputation eroded over time. (Hendrik Hertzberg, who wrote the speech, makes the case that its reputation suffered because Carter asked for the resignation of his entire Cabinet three days after the speech.) Carter was actually trying to show leadership, though everything from his purposeful hand chops to the vast desk made him look smaller than the moment. Carter quoted a young southern governor: ""Mr. President, you're not leading this nation. You're just managing the government."" (That governor, it turns out, was Bill Clinton.) Obama is similarly limited by the kind of leadership he can show right now. Only BP can ""plug the damn hole,"" as the president put it. There's been a lot of talk about whether Obama has shown enough anger. It's this impotence, say aides and White House advisers, that makes Obama angry (though it's not the kind of anger he can show in public). As the president said recently, ""I can't dive down there and plug the hole. I can't suck it up with a straw."" Without a hill to charge, Obama can endure the frustration, update the country on the cleanup efforts, and grind it out. Or he can point to another hill and promise to take it. That's what a call for comprehensive energy legislation from the Oval Office would amount to. It would get his blood going, focus the nation on activity where the president can exercise actual leadership and perhaps even move toward the goal of energy independence, which both parties say they want. On energy legislation, however, such a gambit is politically trickier than on health care, in part because there is very little time left in the legislative year. He has actually already made the call for bold energy legislation. Two weeks ago in Pittsburgh, he said he would find the votes to pass legislation that ""put a price on carbon""--the aspect of reform that has become the key test of seriousness, because doing so would encourage market forces to reflect the true cost of carbon-dioxide emissions. The president's call was not exactly greeted with the roar of the vuvuzela. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has told White House aides there are at least 11 Democrats who oppose the Kerry-Lieberman bill, the most comprehensive climate-change legislation in the Senate. (The House passed its own version last summer.) Recently, Obama's Democratic allies on the Hill have said there is only support for an ""energy only"" bill that does not include the controversial cap-and-trade mechanism that would put a price on carbon. ""It must be nice not to have to count votes,"" said a top Democratic aide on the Hill on hearing Mike Allen's report in Politico  that the White House was thinking of a renewed push to support a robust bill. This is a nose-counting problem but also a political one. Unlike financial regulatory reform, through which Obama was able to portray Republicans who opposed legislation as captives of Wall Street bankers, the issue of climate change is murkier. With so many Democratic opponents of energy legislation, the argument that the GOP is the party of Big Oil may be less effective. There are other challenges beyond recalcitrant Democrats. Obama would have to be the legislation's top salesman. He's not that great at selling. For months, he has tried to convince the country that his stimulus legislation improved the economy. In a recent Congressional Connection poll, 35 percent of those surveyed said the president's economic policies have had no effect, and 29 percent said they have made things worse. He has also given countless speeches on the health care plan that passed this spring. A majority of voters still don't like it. Obama would have to argue why this incident, marked by well-documented failures by the private sector and lax public-sector oversight, demands such ambitious legislation that goes beyond drilling deep-water wells. Selling the legislation would also leave Obama less time to talk about the economy, the issue voters will be focused on in November, after the leak is presumably finally plugged. That's what the Democratic senatorial and congressional campaign committees would prefer that he do, because it helps their candidates in this rough election year. Republicans have also labeled the House bill as ""cap and tax"" and are bashing Democrats in vulnerable districts. Obama has been inching toward making this broader pitch. In addition to the speech in Pittsburgh (in which his remarks were overshadowed by his attack on Republicans), he recently compared the effects of the Gulf spill to the effects of 9/11. In an interview with Roger Simon of Politico, Obama said Americans will now think about environmental policy differently, just as they rethought national security after 9/11. On Monday, he sent a note to his political supporters asking for their help in passing comprehensive legislation. Having approached the bold move, we'll learn on Tuesday night just how committed the president plans to be. He has already defined the boundaries of his salesmanship. On the weak side is his push for the public option during health care reform. In speeches he said he'd prefer it, but he was mostly absent from the legislative fight. In promoting financial regulatory reform, however, he was much more engaged. He attacked Republican leader Mitch McConnell directly and spoke out regularly against specific amendments that were being debated in Congress. There is, in fact, a third category of Oval Office address. Presidents give them at the end of their time in office. In various contexts, Obama has said he'd rather do the right thing than win re-election. Aides say that applies to this issue. If that's true, then he'll be speaking about energy legislation at least one more time from behind his desk. The question is whether that final speech will be in two years or six.

24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/06/obama_made_me_do_it.html	"About a month after Rod Blagojevich was elected governor of Illinois in November 2002, I went to a fundraiser for a Chicago ward boss. Held at a banquet hall, it was like a three-dot gossip column come to life, as the emcee recited the names of all the pols who'd come to pay their respects. (""Judge Murphy is with us tonight ... and here, from the Water Reclamation District ...."") I'd been dragged there by a punch-drunk, putty-nosed boxer named Johnny Lira, aka. the World Class Pug. Johnny had once fought for the lightweight title but now dabbled in politics. As we circulated among tables of sewer workers who'd been forced to buy $100 tickets, I ran into an old ward heeler who'd gotten his start in the organization of Blagojevich's father-in-law, a powerful alderman. ""I'm going to be stumping for Rod in New Hampshire in 2008,"" the man said. Not to brag about my political instincts, but I laughed at the prospect of President Blagojevich. At the time, though, Hot Rod was the Democratic Party's biggest star. After more than two decades of Republican crooks in the governor's mansion, the voters of Illinois had decided it was time to give a Democratic crook a chance. As it turned out, another Illinois politician ended up stumping in New Hampshire. But in 2002, Barack Obama was an obscure state senator who was still recovering from his ass-whipping in a congressional race two years before. All this explains a lot about how Rod Blagojevich plans to conduct himself at his corruption trial, which is expected to last all summer and will focus in part on the question of whether he tried to sell the Senate seat vacated by Obama. (As governor, Blagojevich had the power to appoint Obama's replacement, which he used to name the has-been Roland Burris.) It's going to be the political spectacle of the year, as Blagojevich uses his latest public platform to remind the world that he and Obama are products of the same sleazy political culture. Blagojevich's lawyers have already tried to subpoena Obama to impeach the testimony of developer and Obama fundraiser Tony Rezko. Rezko, who is cooperating with the government's case against Blagojevich, has told investigators he tried to buy Obama's influence with illegal campaign contributions. Only Obama can rebut that claim, Blagojevich argued. U.S. District Court Judge James B. Zagel turned down Blagojevich's request to subpoena the president, but the ex-governor will be hauling in Obamanauts Rahm Emanuel, now White House chief of staff, and senior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett. According to some reports, Obama used Emanuel to persuade Blagojevich to appoint Jarrett to the Senate seat. If Blagojevich goes down, he wants to take the Illinois Democratic establishment with him. Even as hungry young Democrats in Springfield, Blagojevich and Obama were suspicious of each other. And not just because both wanted to be president. They represented two different strains in Chicago politics. Blagojevich, raised in a dreary apartment by a steelworker father, considered Obama an elitist egghead from Hyde Park, the academic ghetto surrounding the University of Chicago. Obama thought Blagojevich was a vapid machine-politics hack. As a loyal Democrat, though, Obama sat in on Blagojevich's campaign strategy sessions, where he learned to emulate the candidate's two-handed approach to politicking: the right hand shakes, the left goes for the wallet. Obama became a more aggressive fundraiser after watching in awe as Blagojevich collected $24 million during his first run for governor. Obama even used Blagojevich as an example of how an ethnically exotic candidate could succeed in the Midwest. ""There are some who might say that somebody named Barack Obama can't be elected senator in the state of Illinois,"" Obama would tell audiences. ""They're probably the same folks who said that a guy named Rod Blagojevich couldn't be elected governor of the state of Illinois."" The two liberals collaborated on a bill that added 20,000 children to the state's health insurance plan. But Blagojevich could never hide his envy of Obama's rise, mocking him as ""Baaary Obaaama"" in an exaggerated Chicago accent. After Obama's roof-raiser at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, Blagojevich told him, ""Great speech, Barack. But remember, this is as good as it gets."" Now Obama is president. Blagojevich, meanwhile, was the break-out buffoon on Celebrity Apprentice, where he distinguished himself with his napping and hapless typing. Blagojevich's lead attorney is Sam Adam Jr., a rotund 37-year-old who made his bones by delivering the bombastic (and successful) closing argument at R&B singer R. Kelly's child-pornography trial. I watched that trial, and I left uncertain whether Adam had attended law school or just rented  ... And Justice for All on DVD. If Sam Jr. could acquit a guy who was (allegedly) caught on videotape with a 13-year-old girl, imagine what he can do with Blagojevich, who's only on audio. Blagojevich may be saved by the fact that his alleged criminal career was as ineffectual as his gubernatorial reign. In both endeavors, he made a lot of threats and promises, but he didn't actually do anything. As governor, he failed to provide health insurance to all Illinoisans, failed to pass a $34 billion plan to build new roads and schools, and (obviously) failed to keep his inaugural vow to end the state's ""pay to play"" political culture. Despite his assertion that Obama's Senate seat was ""fucking golden, and I'm not just giving it up for fuckin' nothing,"" Blagojevich's arrest forced him to give it away for nothing. According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, Blagojevich allegedly demanded that Emanuel hold a fundraiser for him before he released grant money for a school in his district. When the school's bills came due, Blagojevich caved, forking over the grant. Blagojevich's cronies allegedly tried to extort a campaign contribution from an investment firm by threatening to deny it money from the Teachers Retirement System. After the firm promised to expose them, they decided the shakedown was ""too risky."" Remember Jimmy Breslin's book  The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight? Blagojevich brought Breslin to court on Tuesday. The semi-retired chronicler of big-city mopes is writing a book about the case. Maybe he can call it The Gang That Couldn't Be Crooked Straight. The prosecution says Blagojevich tried to sell Obama's seat because he was $200,000 in debt. Adam had an answer for that: The fact that Blagojevich was broke proves that ""he didn't take a dime."" In his opening statement Tuesday, Adam portrayed the two-term governor of Illinois as an unsophisticated, gullible street kid who had no idea Rezko and other advisers were plotting hinky scams out of his office. ""He was fooled,"" Adam said of Blagojevich. One of those advisers, Blagojevich's former chief of staff, Lon Monk, took the stand Wednesday. In exchange for rolling over on his ex-boss, Monk received a two-year sentence for conspiracy to solicit a bribe. Monk discussed how he, Rezko, and Blagojevich confidant Christopher Kelly, who committed suicide as a result of his legal troubles, raised all those millions for Blagojevich's 2002 election. Blagojevich's antics since he lost the governorship--his memoir, his weekly radio show, his Elvis impersonation  alongside a Fabio look-alike at a block party, his appearance on Celebrity Apprentice--have been described as efforts to taint the jury pool by declaring his innocence in every available medium. By making a fool of himself, Blagojevich could also be trying to build the impression that he's a harmless clown, incapable of the political venalities he's accused of. As a campaigner, Blagojevich never lost an election. Before this trial even started, he was already employing his charm: During jury selection, Blagojevich flirted with the courtroom sketch artists until they both cracked smiles. Hey, it worked on Celebrity Apprentice. Blagojevich's fellow C-listers expected a corrupt, hardened politician but developed a fondness for their bumbling castmate. ""I think a lot of people are liking Rod,"" Donald Trump concluded. Now, once again, Rod Blagojevich has to convince a dozen people he's not such a bad guy. This is his last campaign. It's a long fall from plotting for the presidency. Like  Slate on Facebook. Follow us  on Twitter."	Obama made me do it: How Rod Blagojevich plans to turn his trial into a political spectacle.

25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/06/phoney_question.html	"In the wake of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill have come a lot of new rules for presidential behavior. Based on what Obama has been criticized for --and the length he's gone to avoid criticism--he and future presidents battling a crisis will be expected to make weekly visits to the disaster area and cancel foreign trips, White House cultural events, and courtside interviews. Also, quit playing golf in advance of the crisis. Oh, and in a lasting (everlasting) crisis, the president must show anger, or at least urgency--in press conferences, on cable shows, and in leaked newspaper accounts--that includes, but is not limited to, jaw clenching and mild swearing. Most of these rituals are ad-hoc--a pinch of tradition and a big dose of free-floating political pressure from opponents and pundits. The newest item on the crisis etiquette list concerns the president's use of the telephone.  In the 50 days since the gulf oil spill, Obama has not called the CEO of British Petroleum, Tony Hayward. Is this another example of Obama's ironic detachment from his duties as president or a meaningless act of theater he has wisely blown off? It might be both. We require a lot from our presidents, and our demands are contradictory. They must be able to stop oil leaking from the center of the earth and reverse the momentum of a $14 trillion economy. Then, under the weight of those kinds of stressful demands, we also ask that they sit through countless ceremonies, celebrations, and other time-consuming tedium. The presidential phone call encapsulates this confusing tension nicely. Presidents call Super Bowl coaches and congratulate negligible dignitaries on their elections. But they also are supposed to have the ultimate hot line, calling world leaders to bend them to America's will. It is one of the symbols of the boundless power of the office that a president can pick up the phone and say, ""Get me X,"" and X will be on the other end of the line shortly. (This one knows not to say, ""Get me Osama Bin Laden."") Every White House spurts out pictures of the president on the phone, issuing orders and pressing the case, to show action: Look how busy he is! The most famous case was in 1969, when Richard Nixon called Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong just after they set foot on the moon. Every chief executive should be seen as in command on the phone (if perhaps not as detail-oriented as Lyndon Johnson was when he called to dictate the particulars of his trousers to his tailor Joe Haggar). Obama has boasted about being a phone-talker. Even when he was a senator, he told the New York Times that he loved that ""everybody takes your phone calls."" Obama also said in that interview, ""If there is a topic I'm interested in, I can call the smartest people in the world on that topic and talk to them about it."" His aides have promoted this image of a president who is not only curious but actively engaged in reaching out to communicate. The caption is the same for each one: ""taking care of business."" If it's an irritating ritual of the presidency, it's also one they've encouraged. So we're not crazy for wondering whether Obama has put in a call to Hayward. When NBC's Matt Lauer asked the question, Obama said that ""my experience is when you talk to a guy like a BP CEO, he's going to say all the right things to me. I'm not interested in words. I'm interested in actions."" Fair enough. But. If words are going to be defined as the absence of action, Obama is in trouble. Indeed, that's what Obama is promising us with his response to the spill. He's talking a lot but also promising that he's going to act. You could imagine some number of voters saying about the president, ""He's going to say all the right things to me. I'm not interested in words. I'm interested in actions."" At the same time, what would be the point of calling Hayward? The president brushed off Lauer's suggestion that on the phone he could give the BP CEO a piece of his mind. He said that simply getting angry might be what commentators want but won't produce a solution. It's true. They're not going to come up with a new strategy for plugging the well in a one-to-one chat. Nor would a call really satisfy the vast and conflicted pent up demand for a public display of emotion. To do that, the president would have to bop around like Bobby McFerrin. Of course, in a sense it doesn't matter that a call would be substantive or puny PR. When it came out last fall that Obama hadn't talked with his Afghanistan commander, Stanley McChrystal, in the month after the general submitted his assessment of conditions there, that was shocking. The president had said Afghanistan was his top foreign-policy priority, and yet with his penchant for direct inquiry, he hadn't talked to the general he'd put there to turn things around? (Days later, the White House put together a quick meeting with Obama and the general.) But calling the BP CEO is not really analogous to the McChrystal case, because Obama is not gathering facts from a subordinate who serves under him. Plus, he wouldn't trust Hayward to be straight, anyway. By the end of the day Tuesday, Sarah Palin published a long critique of Obama's lack of a phone call, saying it showed he was too trusting of BP. ""The current administration may be unaware that it's the President's duty, meeting on a CEO-to-CEO level with Hayward, to verify what BP reports,"" she said. It's hard to see how a president would have the time or inclination to do the fact-checking himself, given other priorities related to the spill--or the special knowledge to it (though he had deputized his Ph.D. energy secretary to do it). Given Hayward's performance and the larger BP confusion or evasion about the oil flow, it's hard to imagine how a phone call would spring the truth, either. A phone call can send a message. But the messages Obama wants to convey to BP are more powerful when made in public. The time has passed for the low-grade spin of a phone call. Obama scoffs at the demand that he vent, but it's not that he doesn't want to do it. He's already tried and it didn't work. Three weeks ago in the Rose Garden, he chastised company executives for finger-pointing. Showing anger at BP executives in front of the cameras puts public pressure on BP, shows the government isn't too close to the company, and shows the public that the president is doing something. His public warning to press BP not to ""nickel and dime"" Gulf area residents is a good sound-bite example. In a crisis, the silly duties of the presidency go from merely annoying to threatening, because they distract from fixing the problem. Another such distraction will no doubt arise over the location of the president's summer vacation. If Obama vacations in Martha's Vineyard as he has before, critics will pounce. He's not on the job and not heeding his own travel advice, which has been that families should vacation in the Gulf. He has made the pitch that the waters are safe during his emergency visits. Why not send a stronger message by vacationing there himself? The president will have to decide whether this is a silly question that can be ignored or an ad-hoc ritual that must be performed.

27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/06/the_backward_party.html	"The Obama Partisanship Meter took another small jump today. When last we checked the needle, President Obama had tweaked Republicans at a Democratic fundraiser, using pointed language to blame them for doing nothing to help improve the economy. It was an escalation in his rhetoric, but it was delivered to a partisan crowd. Today, in a noncampaign event, Obama made his critique more explicit. The Democratic National Committee will be relying this fall on the president to sell the economic recovery and define the opposition. In Pittsburgh Wednesday, Obama did both. He didn't simply criticize Republicans. He implicated them in a unified and multifaceted narrative of blame. After explaining how his administration had reacted to the financial crisis, Obama told of how the opposition hadn't been much help. His opponents, he said, were playing politics. ""Before I was even inaugurated, the congressional leaders of the other party got together and made a calculation that if I failed, they'd win,"" he said. The president then turned to the merits of their argument. ""To be fair,"" he started, as if to suggest he might be, ""a good deal of the other party's opposition to our agenda has been rooted in their sincere and fundamental belief about the role of government."" Noncraven Republicans who did not attend the pre-inauguration ""Obama Must Fail"" meeting might have thought he was going to assign them to a more benevolent category. They were soon disappointed. The president went on to define what Republican beliefs entailed: ""It's an agenda that basically offers two answers to every problem we face: more tax breaks for the wealthy and fewer rules for corporations."" The president left out their plan to punish the elderly and infirm just for sport. (For those interested in a more thoughtful speech, and a more generous interpretation of conservatism, read the president's remarks recently at the University of Michigan commencement.) Though the speech was billed as a talk on the economy, it had all the hallmarks of a campaign speech, including the whiff of focus-group-tested phrases. ""They want to go back. We want to go forward,"" said the president. It was a mantra repeated throughout his remarks. The goal, as Democrats have been saying for months, is to make the November elections a choice between alternatives, not a referendum on the Democrats. The underlying theme of the speech was a defense of government. ""It's our job as a nation to advocate on behalf of the America that we hope for,"" he said, arguing that only an activist government could provide a minimum safety net and give opportunity to poor students, innovative research, and businesses that invest in cleaner energy technologies. As he reached the end of his remarks, Obama got specific about pending legislation, making his strongest pitch yet for the Senate climate change legislation. ""The time has come to aggressively accelerate"" the effort to put a price on carbon pollution, he said, before making a commitment: ""The votes might not be there right now, but I intend to find them in the coming months."" This is a different level of motivation than he demonstrated on immigration reform. On that topic, Obama said there was only so much he could do to push legislation because Republicans would not give him the votes. The Gulf disaster provides all the motivation necessary for Obama to strongly support the legislation. But there's also a political benefit. With so few ways to show that he is in command of the spill and its cleanup, the legislation also provides the president with another opportunity to take command. He can show that he is fighting to protect the country from being in such a vulnerable position in the future. Republicans will no doubt react to this speech by giving him lots of opportunities to fight. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/05/alter_bathes_obama_in_heavenly_light.html	Is Barack Obama the Risen and the True Vine? To answer this question, Slate has periodically gathered gratuitously adoring material from coverage of the Nobel Peace Prize-winner, best-selling author, Harvard Law Review president, Men's Vogue cover model, two-time Grammy winner, efficient note-taker, physics wunderkind, descendant of George Washington's great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, teenage jazz enthusiast, possible telepathic communicator with space aliens from distant galaxies, surpasser of all civil rights gains since 1957, calmer of turbulent Iowans, bearer of photographic halos, occasion for reportorial clairvoyance, and (not least) president of the United States. Our latest entry is from  The Promise, my friend Jonathan Alter's newly published account of Obama's first year in the White House. The book is packed with wonderful Woodward-esque insider tidbits (The Big Money published a piquant excerpt about how Larry Summers froze out Paul Volcker) and renders some impressively tough judgments about Obama. (For example, Alter faults the president for failing to bring into government many people with extensive experience in business.) You should read it!

29	29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/05/news_you_can_use.html	"""Rule 1: Never allow a crisis to go to waste,""  said Rahm Emanuel on Nov. 9, 2008. ""They are opportunities to do big things."" But in the wake of the Gulf oil spill, Democrats have failed to follow Rule 2: Shameless emotional exploitation is your friend. Logic would suggest that the BP oil spill would make comprehensive energy legislation more likely, if not inevitable--especially if, as appears to be the case, there were systemic lapses that contributed to the accident. Instead, legislation has become  less likely. The Senate energy bill predates the spill, and the disaster may actually succeed in killing it. After the accident, the White House put a  freeze on new offshore drilling. This caused Senate Republicans whose support of any legislation depended on its allowance of continued drilling to back away from the bill. Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, wouldn't commit to a bill that would allow drilling. (Of course, before all this happened, Sen. Lindsey Graham, the bill's lone Republican sponsor,  pulled his support of the bill after Democrats broke their promise to prioritize energy over immigration reform.) It's hard to exaggerate the absurdity of this scenario. Imagine if, after 9/11, a group of fiscally hawkish senators opposed invading Afghanistan because it would cost too much. You can't, can you? Their position would have been untenable. America was attacked and all you care about is deficit reduction? Supporters of an invasion would have milked the moment for all its emotional worth. And the fiscal hawks would have buckled. So why hasn't something similar happened with energy legislation? There would come a point, you'd think, when the oil spill was such an unmitigated disaster, environmentally and politically, that Republicans would set aside their ultimatums about drilling, Democrats would set aside their paranoia about it, and members of both parties would support alternative energy legislation. Not all of them. Just a handful would be enough. But for that to happen, Democrats would have to demand it. And so far they haven't. Sens. John Kerry and Joe Lieberman, the remaining sponsors of the energy bill, have been pushing hard to keep fellow senators onboard. At a Christian Science Monitor breakfast on Wednesday, Kerry implied that his fellow Democrats should get over their fears about drilling: ""We are not going to stop drilling in the Gulf tomorrow, folks,"" he said. ""Let's be realistic. There are 48,000 wells out there. One of them went sour. About 30 percent of our transportation fuel comes from the Gulf. You think Americans are going to suddenly stop driving to work tomorrow?"" But swaying senators means pulling out all the emotional stops. Blown-up photos of  oiled birds. Testimony from fishermen who lost their livelihood. Aerial shots of miles of unswimmable beach. It's manipulative. It builds bad faith. It may even be misleading. And it works. There's plenty to exploit, too. Emotions are running high. Seventy-six percent of Americans disapprove of how BP has handled the cleanup, according to a CNN  poll. And the spill  hasn't yet tarnished President Obama, as Katrina did George W. Bush--one recent poll found that more people approve than disapprove of his handling of the spill. (Although the tide may be  turning.) Obama is beginning to seize the moment. At a fundraiser for Sen. Barbara Boxer on Wednesday, he called the spill ""heartbreaking"" and  said that it highlights the need for a ""long-term strategy"" to ""start cultivating solar and wind and biodiesel."" He will make the case again in a  speech and press conference on Thursday. He's also  toughening the rules on drilling. But his anger over the spill itself--""Plug the damn hole,"" Obama said this week--far outweighs his anger over the hold-up in the Senate. Recall his involvement in the health care debate. He gave dozens of speeches. He addressed pressure groups. He personally courted swing votes. On financial regulation reform, he has  called out specific senators and provisions for criticism. A climate bill requires the same. Perhaps even more, since a climate bill could make Majority Leader Harry Reid  vulnerable in November. But as Dave Roberts of Grist has  argued, ""The only way this thing gets done is if Obama lays himself on the line for it."" That includes making the emotional case. He will have to cry over spilled oil. Like  Slate on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	Why aren't Democrats emotionally exploiting the oil spill?	['Reid', 'Roberts', 'Boxer', 'Obama']	[]
