""Frankly, if we had not gone through our 10-year slide in research support, we probably would have had a vaccine in time for this that would've gone through clinical trials and would have been ready,"" Collins said, noting that federally funded scientists have been working on a vaccine since at least 2001. The NIH head didn't point fingers at either party, and it's doubtful he was intentionally politicizing Ebola. (More likely, he was just highlighting the obvious: The less money the NIH has for research, the less research it can do.) You can't say the same for a whole lot of other people in Washington. Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren have both suggested that U.S.-led efforts to combat the Ebola outbreak have been hampered by the sequester and the years of budget cuts that preceded it. That attack moved from the implicit to the explicit when a little-known liberal group ginned up Beltway headlines with an attention-grabbing ""Republican cuts kill"" ad campaign--at which point the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee picked up the ball and ran with it. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, meanwhile, returned fire for Republicans, arguing that the issue isn't how much the federal government spends on medical research but how it spends the cash. ""Bike lanes and farmer's markets may indeed help a community,"" Jindal wrote in reference to the type of federal programs the GOP loves to laugh at, ""but they would do little to combat dangerous diseases like Ebola, SARS, or anthrax."" This isn't a new debate, and both parties are playing to type: Democrats are saying we should have spent more, Republicans that we should have spent better. In hindsight, both arguments have merit. Given a do-over knowing what we do now, Congress would almost certainly beef up funds for Ebola research and prevention. If you look at the record, though, it's hard to argue that either party displayed much foresight prior to Ebola's arrival on American shores. President Obama's 2015 budget request--unveiled this past spring--kept NIH funding largely flat. On the GOP side, it's impossible to imagine that Republicans, with their preference for keeping research money at home, would have rerouted funds from bike lanes to Ebola at a time when the disease was other countries' problem. A quick look at the federal budget makes it clear that the NIH and their fellow experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are being asked, by both parties, to do more with less. Since the NIH began working on an Ebola vaccine in the early 2000s, the institute's roughly $30 billion budget has held relatively steady, losing about $5 billion worth of spending power to inflation over that time. The CDC's emergency preparedness budget has been cut roughly in half since 2001, from about $1 billion in 2001 to $585 million in 2013. Total federal spending on Ebola research, meanwhile, dropped from $59 million in 2006 to $42.5 million in 2013, according to Bloomberg News. There's no way to know for certain whether Collins' answer to his own hypothetical is correct. But given that the NIH hopes to begin clinical trials on an Ebola vaccine by December, it's certainly plausible to think that timeline could have been accelerated if more money had been thrown at the problem. More money wouldn't have just meant more vaccine research. It could have also helped test more mundane hospital procedures that could prove vital in stopping Ebola's spread. Unfortunately, as Wired's Maryn McKenna has detailed, that type of secondary research doesn't make for good stump speeches or Senate stemwinders:"	Why Don't We Have an Ebola Vaccine? Democrats and Republicans Fight Over Who's to Blame.

Or does it give conservative politicians wiggle room to exploit the issue in elections? The question has come up in Colorado, where Bob Beauprez, the Republican nominee for governor, is pounding Democratic incumbent John Hickenlooper for granting a reprieve to a man on death row. Beauprez, a Catholic, claims that the former archbishop of Denver, Charles Chaput, told him it's OK to support the death penalty. Is it?

""It was just a cigarette! Mister, it's just a cigarette, sir!"" The video focuses, and you see a plainclothes police officer holding 17-year-old Marcel Hamer to the gutter with his foot. He bends down, punches the man in the head, and tries to arrest him. ""Do you wanna get fucked up?"" the office says, ""Yeah, get it on film,"" he continues. At this point, the young man is unconscious and unresponsive, and his friends are still shouting, screaming that he's knocked out, begging him to get up. This footage--taken on June 4--comes from New York City, and follows video of a similar incident from August in a nearby neighborhood, where an officer pistol-whipped an unarmed 16-year-old for briefly running away from police. But there's an important difference between the two videos. In the second, we see a familiar scene: black youth, white cops. The first, on the other hand, shows something less common: a black youth and a black cop. In the aftermath of the shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, where Michael Brown--a black teenager--was killed by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, we learned that Ferguson Police Department was nearly 95 percent white in a town where blacks were the large majority. Residents wanted change. ""We want answers, we want justice in our community, we want diversity,"" said Rev. Derrick Robinson in one of the early protests. On the last point, at least, Ferguson city leaders agreed. ""We hire everyone that we can get,"" said Mayor James Knowles when asked about police diversity. ""There's also the problem that a lot of young African-American people don't want to go into law enforcement. They already have this disconnect with law enforcement, so if we find people who want to go into law enforcement who are African-American we're all over it because we want them to help us bridge the gap."" Likewise, during one forum, Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson said, ""The perception is if we don't have the diversity, we don't have the understanding, and perception is reality."" But there's a problem. For as much as police diversity has value for image and community relations, it's not clear that it does anything to cure the problem of police abuse and brutality in black and Latino communities. Just because an officer is black, in other words, doesn't mean he's less likely to use violence against black citizens. The best look at this comes from Brad W. Smith, a researcher from Wayne State University in Detroit. In a 2003 paper, he looks at the impact of police diversity on officer-involved homicides in cities of more than 100,000 residents and cities of more than 250,000 residents. Regardless of city size, there wasn't a relationship between racial representation and police killings--officer diversity didn't mean much. At most, in smaller cities, female officers were more likely to commit shootings than their male counterparts, a fact--he speculates--that could be tied to sexist pressures on female officers, who might feel the need to act ""tough"" to prove their bona fides. What mattered for police shootings wasn't the makeup of the police department, it was the makeup of the city. In all measured cities, an increase in black residents brought an increase in police shootings. In smaller cities, a substantial change in the proportion of black residents resulted in a slight increase in the predicted number of police-caused homicides. And in the larger cities, the same change increased the chance for police-caused homicides by a factor of 10 compared to smaller cities. Put another way, the quickest way to predict the number of police shootings in a city is to see how many blacks live there. And, in turn, the most likely victims of fatal police shootings are young black males. According to a ProPublica analysis of federal data on police shootings, young black males ages 15 to 19 are 21 times more likely to be shot and killed by police than their white counterparts. ""One way of appreciating that stark disparity,"" notes ProPublica, ""is to calculate how many more whites over those three years would have had to have been killed for them to have been at equal risk. The number is jarring--185, more than one per week."" What's most relevant for the diversity of police departments is this fact: While black officers are involved in just 10 percent of police shootings, 78 percent of those they kill are black. The glib response to stats on blacks and police is to cite so-called ""black crime"" or ""black criminality."" But this depends on a major analytical error. Yes, blacks are overrepresented in arrest and conviction rates. At the same time, ""criminal blacks"" are a tiny, unrepresentative fraction of all black Americans. If you walked into a group of 1,000 randomly selected blacks, the vast majority--upward of 998--would never have had anything to do with violent crime. To generalize from the two is to confuse the specific (how blacks are represented among criminals) with the general (how criminals are represented among blacks). Statisticians call this a ""base rate error,"" and you should try to avoid it. In fairness, you could apply this to police as well. The number of cops who shoot--much less shoot black Americans--is a small percentage of all cops. Why judge the whole by the actions of a few? But there are problems here. Policing is a profession backed by the state and imbued with the right--and reasonable latitude--to use lethal force. Even if we're looking at a small number of cops, it's still a serious problem when those who shoot are most likely to kill people from a specific group. Moreover, the problem of blacks and police goes beyond shootings to general interactions between black communities and law enforcement. We know, for instance, that officers are more likely to use force against black protesters than white ones. The stats on shooting are just one part of a larger dynamic that applies to police departments across the country, not just individual cops. The history of American policing is tied tightly to its relationship with black Americans and other minorities. The earliest police antecedents were slave patrols and anti-native militias, built to suppress rebellion and combat Native Americans. After the Civil War, Southern whites used police as a new tool for control, terrorizing blacks under the guise of law enforcement, from lynchings--often organized or supported by local sheriffs--to convict leasing. Elsewhere, in the industrial cities of the Northeast and Midwest, policing became a pathway for immigrant mobility. At the same time, police attention turned to black migrants, who were condemned as lazy and criminal. As historian Khalil Gibran Muhammad describes, police during the New York race riots of 1900 and 1905 ""abdicated their responsibility to dispense color-blind service and protection, resulting in ... indiscriminate mass arrests of blacks attacked by white mobs."" The antagonism between blacks and police would continue through the 20th century. As BuzzFeed's Adam Serwer notes in an essay on Ferguson, the urban riots of the 1960s--and beyond--were fueled by police abuse, ""The recipe for urban riots since 1935 is remarkably consistent and the ingredients are almost always the same: An impoverished and politically disempowered black population refused full American citizenship, a heavy-handed and overwhelmingly white police force, a generous amount of neglect, and frequently, the loss of black life at the hands of the police."" For a more vivid picture, there's James Baldwin's 1960 essay on Harlem--""Fifth Avenue, Uptown""--where he describes the meaning of the white policeman in the black ghetto:"	Why More Diverse Police Departments Won't Put an End to Police Misconduct 
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/thom_tillis_doesn_t_want_to_discuss_gay_marriage_the_gop_senate_candidate.html	"Thursday night, in a debate for North Carolina's U.S. Senate seat, Republican nominee Thom Tillis was asked about the state's constitutional amendment against gay marriage. The amendment, enacted through a 2012 ballot measure, has been tied up in court. Tillis, the speaker of the state House of Representatives, said he would defend the amendment because ""60 percent of the people of North Carolina"" voted for it. If 60 percent of North Carolinians favored the amendment, you'd expect Tillis to say more. He's in a neck-and-neck race against Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan, who opposes the amendment. He needs votes, and grabbing hold of a 60 percent issue is a great way to get them. Instead, Tillis changed the subject. Hagan, given a minute to address the amendment, used her time to criticize it. Tillis, given the same allotment, brushed past the question in seven seconds. He called it a distraction and used his time to talk instead about economic policy, voter ID laws, and Hagan's committee attendance record. Why would a politician duck what he calls a 60 percent issue? Because it isn't a 60 percent issue. North Carolina's marriage amendment never had 60 percent support. Today, it doesn't even have majority support. Public opinion there, as everywhere else, is moving toward gay marriage. And Republicans know it. Tillis' verbatim answer, before he scampered away, was that ""28 months ago, 60 percent of the people of North Carolina decided that they wanted to define marriage as an institution between a man and a woman."" Each element of that sentence is misleading. Let's take it apart. Start with the core claim that ""60 percent of the people of North Carolina"" voted for the amendment. As WRAL's Mark Binker and Laura Leslie point out, the state has nearly 10 million people.* Some 6.6 million are registered to vote. About 2.2 million voted on the amendment, which was put on the ballot not in the general election but in the primary, when fewer people--by and large, those who are more partisan--go to the polls. Altogether, 1.3 million people voted for the amendment. That's 61 percent of those who showed up, but it's only about 20 percent of the state's voters. According to the Institute for Southern Studies, it's the lowest turnout, in percentage terms, for any anti-gay-marriage ballot measure passed in the South. You can argue that turnout doesn't matter, because people who didn't show up forfeited their say. But in a general election, many of those people will show up. The last time Hagan was on the ballot, in 2008, more than 4 million voters turned out. That's about twice the size of the electorate that passed the gay marriage amendment. If the turnout for Hagan's re-election bid is similar, the additional 2 million voters will almost certainly be younger than those who voted on the 2012 amendment, since that primary electorate was skewed toward old people. That's bad news for Tillis. In North Carolina, as in every other state, young people are twice as likely as old people to support gay marriage. Would this broader electorate support the amendment? Not if they find out what's in it. In his 7-second answer, Tillis said people who voted for the amendment did so ""to define marriage as an institution between a man and a woman."" But that's not what the amendment said. It said ""marriage between one man and one woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized in this State."" In other words, civil unions and domestic partnerships are also forbidden. At the time of the referendum, two survey organizations--Elon University and Public Policy Polling--repeatedly asked North Carolina voters to choose among three positions. One position was ""full marriage rights for same-sex couples"" (or ""gay couples should be allowed to legally marry""). The second position was ""I oppose any legal recognition for same-sex couples"" (or ""there should be no legal recognition of a gay couple's relationship""). The middle option was ""civil unions or partnership for same-sex couples, but not full marriage rights"" (or ""gay couples should be allowed to form civil unions but not legally marry""). In seven samples taken over the course of three years, the number of polls in which a majority chose gay marriage was zero. The number of polls in which a majority opposed legal recognition was also zero. In every survey, 55 percent to 60 percent of respondents chose either gay marriage or the middle option. Support for the no-recognition position ranged from 29 percent to 42 percent. Two polls tested what would happen if voters understood the ballot language. One poll asked people whether they favored an amendment that ""would prevent any same-sex marriages, domestic partnerships, or civil unions."" Thirty-two percent supported that proposal. Sixty-one percent opposed it. Another poll asked, ""If you knew that Amendment One banned both gay marriage and civil unions, would you vote yes or no?"" Thirty-eight percent said yes. Forty-six percent said no. If the amendment were put on the ballot this fall, it wouldn't get anywhere near 60 percent. In the last year, the best showing I can find for opponents was a PPP survey taken six months ago. When asked, ""Do you think same-sex marriage should be allowed, or not?"" 53 percent of voters said it shouldn't. From there, it's all downhill. A Kaiser/New York Times poll taken about the same time asked voters whether ""it should be legal or not for same sex couples to marry."" Forty-nine percent said no. Last month, an American Insights survey asked whether ""marriages between same-sex couples should or should not be recognized by the law as valid, with the same rights as traditional marriages."" Voters split evenly, and those younger than 50 leaned in favor. In an Elon poll taken last month, a plurality of likely voters, as well as registered voters and nonvoters, supported gay marriage. The bigger problem for Tillis is that all these polls are moving in the wrong direction. Even the one that showed 53 percent for his side was down 5 points in the last two years. He says the referendum was just 28 months ago, as though that's a short time. But on this issue, it's an eternity. From March 2009 to March 2012, the percentage of North Carolinians who favored full marriage rights for same-sex couples rose from 21 to 38, as measured by Elon surveys. The percentage who opposed any legal recognition for these couples dropped from 44 to 29. Activists and politicians who opposed gay marriage were in a race to codify their position before the tide of public opinion buried them. They succeeded. Since then, the tide has rolled on. In PPP's surveys, the percentage of North Carolinians who favor gay marriage, even when offered civil unions as an alternative, has climbed 9 points. The percentage who oppose any legal recognition has dropped 7 points. Last year, 13 percent of residents in the state said they had changed their minds on this issue. By a factor of 8-to-1, the switchers had embraced same-sex marriage. That's why Tillis ducked the question Thursday night. For Republican politicians, gay marriage is no longer a 60 percent issue. It's a seven-second issue. Even in North Carolina. *Correction, Oct. 13, 2014: This article originally misidentified Laura Leslie are Laurie Leslie. (Return.)"

Compounding the sadness was the fact that he spent his final days isolated from the people he had traveled from Liberia to visit. While the 42-year-old Duncan was being treated at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, his partner, Louise Troh, her 13-year-old son, and two other people who lived with them were quarantined in Dallas. ""I am now dealing with the sorrow and anger that his son was not able to see him before he died,"" Troh said in a statement shortly after Duncan's death, a reference to the 19-year-old son the couple had together, who was away at college when the hospital put his father in isolation. ""This will take some time, but in the end, I believe in a merciful God."" This forced quarantine raises an obvious question: Can the government confine people to what is basically house arrest without due process? The short answer: yes. Both states and the federal government have the legal authority to isolate people in their homes or at other locations if they pose a substantial danger to public health. As difficult as that separation undoubtedly was, doctors in Texas viewed it as a necessity. Troh, her son, and the two others had been in proximity to Duncan when he began to display symptoms--usually the exact moment that an Ebola victim becomes contagious. While none of the four has so far shown any symptoms, it's exceedingly risky to allow them to interact with the general public until doctors can rule out the possibility that they were infected. (The state of Texas will keep them quarantined for at least 10 more days to ensure that Ebola's 21-day incubation period has expired.) The family was originally confined to its own apartment but has since been moved to a larger home in a more remote area. During their time there, they will be barred from leaving or having visitors, while state officials provide them with food and other necessities as doctors monitor their health for the first signs of symptoms. The job of quarantining people who are already in the country typically falls to the states. Laws vary, but most state health departments can quarantine first and ask questions later. In this particular case, the decision came from the Texas Department of State Health Services, which sent two county officials and a local deputy to serve the order at Troh's apartment on Sept. 30, the day a blood test confirmed Duncan's infection. (In Texas, violating such an order is a third-degree felony; in most other states it's a criminal misdemeanor.) Health officials are also keeping close tabs on several dozen people who came into contact with Duncan before his symptoms began, but have so far found no reason to extend the quarantine order to include anyone else. The federal government's chief responsibility, meanwhile, is preventing infectious diseases from reaching the American public in the first place. The first line of defense are the quarantine stations that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention operate at 20 of the most heavily trafficked U.S. ports of call and border crossings. When someone arrives in America who authorities suspect may be infected, they can quarantine the individual until health officials sign off on his or her release. Such screenings aren't foolproof. Authorities, for example, didn't flag Duncan because he denied having contact with anyone infected with Ebola. The federal government announced new screening procedures on Wednesday that will require temperature checks for passengers arriving from the three West African nations that have been hit hardest by the Ebola virus. But that is largely just security theater, since it will do little to stop the spread of the virus. Duncan, for one, would have likely breezed through such a checkpoint because his symptoms did not begin until four days after he arrived in Dallas. The basic logic of quarantine is simple--keep sick or potentially sick people isolated to prevent a disease from spreading--and the tactic has been around since at least the Middle Ages. The word itself is derived from the Italian words quaranta giorni, which translate literally as 40 days--in the 14th century, this was the amount of time ships arriving in Venice from infected ports were required to wait at anchor before docking. According to the CDC, the first quarantine station in the United States was built in 1799 at the port of Philadelphia, six years after a yellow fever outbreak began there. It would take nearly a century before Congress passed the National Quarantine Act in 1878, officially giving the power of quarantine to the federal government. The federal system was then incrementally beefed up over the next several decades, and in 1944 the Public Health Service Act codified the government's responsibility for preventing the spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries to the United States. Though quarantines have long proved effective, the history of forced isolations in America isn't a spotless one. In 1900, health officials in San Francisco attempted to fight an outbreak of the plague by imposing what was basically a complete quarantine of Chinatown. That decision effectively isolated Chinatown's sick and healthy together--and, not incidentally, immigrants from China from the rest of the city. As Wendy Mariner, a professor of health law at the Boston University School of Public Health, recently explained to NPR, the quarantine's borders ""kind of wound around the Caucasian places, so it was pretty obviously discriminatory."" Such miscarriages of justice aside, the states' power to quarantine in the name of public safety has largely been backed up by the courts. Even when an individual challenges his or her isolation or quarantine by petitioning for a writ of habeas corpus, judges usually ""give deference to the determinations of state boards of health and generally uphold such detentions as valid exercises of a state's duty to preserve the public health,"" according to the Congressional Research Center. Perhaps the best example of that was in 1922, when the Illinois Supreme Court upheld the forced quarantine of a woman who ran a boarding house where someone infected with typhoid fever had lived, but who herself had not contracted the disease. The need for isolation and quarantine is all the more evident when you consider how Duncan likely became infected in the first place. According to the New York Times, he had been living alone in a small room he rented in the Liberian capital of Monrovia. When his landlords' daughter fell ill with Ebola last month, Duncan helped take her to and from the hospital. It was that decision that exposed him to the virus that has already killed more than 3,000 people in West Africa--and one that ultimately claimed his own life on Wednesday.

5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/tom_cotton_hypes_the_isis_threat_arkansas_senate_republican_candidate_says.html	"Arkansas Rep.--and Senate hopeful--Tom Cotton is a smart man. He has two degrees from Harvard University, a sharp mind, and the clear admiration of conservative intellectuals. And while intelligence doesn't guarantee a thing in politics, it does tend to be a barrier to the most ridiculous attacks from candidates, who value their reputations as much as they do their success. For Cotton, however, that doesn't seem to be true. Earlier this week, the GOP Senate candidate held a town hall meeting with voters, where those present asked why the government allowed children crossing the border to stay temporarily. Cotton could have told the truth--they were likely in line for a court date and would likely leave the country afterward--or he could have made a generic swipe at Sen. Mark Pryor,  his Democratic opponent, and President Obama. (It's part of the president's plan for illegal amnesty, or something to that effect.) But Cotton took a different, more outlandish approach. ""The problem is with Mark Pryor and Barack Obama refusing to enforce our immigration laws, and refusing to secure our border,"" he began, before dropping the pretense of reality. ""And I would add,"" he continued, ""it's not just an immigration problem. We now know that it's a security problem. Groups like the Islamic State collaborate with drug cartels in Mexico who have clearly shown they're willing to expand outside the drug trade into human trafficking and potentially even terrorism. They could infiltrate our defenseless border and attack us right here in places like Arkansas."" This claim is insane, and what's worse is that Cotton isn't the first Republican to make it. In an ad attacking an Arizona Democrat, the National Republican Campaign Committee warns, ""Evil forces around the world want to harm Americans every day. Their entry into our country? Through Arizona's backyard."" The (hopefully obvious) truth is that this is a fantasy. As Zeke Miller notes for Time, ""[F]ederal law enforcement officials have repeatedly stated that there is no active plot against the U.S. from ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria, and no intelligence to suggest incursions on the Southern border."" If you want to know where the invention began, New York Times columnist Charles Blow traced it to right-wing clearinghouse World Net Daily, which claimed that--according to a ""top U.S. Defense Department analyst under President Bush""--ISIS ""could use the Mexican border to infiltrate America, and it could happen 'sooner rather than later.' "" From there, it traveled to a Texas representative who echoed the thought, a Fox News report on alleged ISIS infiltration of the border, and Gov. Rick Perry, who declared that there's ""a very real possibility"" terrorists have crossed the border. Less drastic ISIS claims have also come from North Carolina Senate candidate Thom Tillis, who has attacked Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan for being timid on the alleged threat--""While ISIS grew, Obama kept waiting, and Kay Hagan kept quiet. The price for their failure is danger,"" a recent ad said--and Colorado Senate candidate Cory Gardner, who has used similar attacks against Sen. Mark Udall. Now, some of this is the usual scaremongering of an election year. Cotton, Tillis, and Gardner are in tight races, with Tillis trailing, Gardner tied, and Cotton fighting to break away from Sen. Pryor, who has kept the race close despite deep-red territory and an unpopular president. And for Gov. Perry--who is all but running for president--flashing the ISIS siren signals a ""tough"" position on war and immigration. But to a large degree, it just reflects the basic hawkishness of Republican Party. With few exceptions (Sen. Rand Paul, mostly), Republicans still have the same war fever that led them to Iraq in 2003. And while Washington writ large favors military force above all other options--hence liberal anger with Obama on his present path in Iraq--segments of the GOP are especially eager, with regular calls for intervention in nearly every area of the world, from Iran to Ukraine. And these ISIS warnings are just the beginning. We're just months away from the official start of the Republican presidential primaries, and with a host of would-be Pattons in the running--in a speech to the conservative American Enterprise Institute, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal declared that ""The best way to avoid battle is to prepare for it""--we should expect much more of this language in the very near future."

6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/democrats_outspend_republicans_on_political_advertising_liberals_make_major.html	"When it comes to winning U.S. Senate races' television ad wars, Team Blue has seized the advantage a month before Election Day. Democratic candidates and their liberal allies last week aired more TV ads than their conservative opponents in seven out of nine top battleground states, according to a Center for Public Integrity analysis of preliminary estimates from Kantar Media/CMAG, an advertising-tracking service. Democrats proved particularly dominant in the U.S. Senate races being waged in Alaska, Georgia, Louisiana, and Michigan, where they bested Republicans by sponsoring hundreds more TV spots throughout each state, the analysis indicates. At the beginning of September, Democrats were producing more TV ads than Republicans, overall, in key Senate battleground states. As September wore on, however, the GOP ate away at those leads. Last week represented a dramatic shift in that dynamic back toward a Democratic advantage. Whereas the Democrats' lead in TV spots during most of the election cycle has been relatively modest, the left's ad buys last week created a large gulf with its conservative opponents. Non-candidate committees--party organizations, super PACs, and nonprofit groups--led the early October advertising spree. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee alone sponsored about 6,300 ads last week across nine states--from Alaska to North Carolina--buoyed by a nearly $25.3 million cash reserve and $5.1 million in debt going into September. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, at more than 2,400 ads across five states, placed a distant second. The NRSC reported several million dollars less on hand heading into September--about $19.9 million--but no debt. Liberal super PAC Senate Majority PAC, at about 2,000 TV ads across five Senate races last week, led all super PACs and nonprofits, which may raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to advocate for or against candidates. The group's largest donors this year include billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, media mogul Fred Eychaner, and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. That a super PAC supporting Democrats is trouncing other non-candidate groups in political messaging illustrates how intimately liberal politicos have embraced the political spending freedoms created by the Supreme Court's Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision of 2010, said John Carroll, a mass communications professor at Boston University and media analysis for Public Radio International's Here and Now. While Republicans grabbed an early and clear spending advantage over Democrats immediately after the Citizens United ruling, Democrats are now ""beginning to beat Republicans at their own game,"" Carroll said. And they're not conserving resources until the very end of the election to make a splash, given that Republicans have a good chance of capturing the six seats they need to win a Senate majority. ""It's a concession to reality--they can be holier than thou and poorer than thou, and they're not willing to do that,"" Carroll said. ""Being against big money was good for rallying the faithful, but [Democrats] are now in for a dime, in for a dollar."" In both Alaska and Louisiana in particular, embattled Democratic senators continued to leverage their vast campaign war chests to their advantage. About 3,700 TV ads aired last week in Louisiana, and Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu's campaign accounted for nearly two-thirds of that sum. Her primary challenger is GOP Rep. Bill Cassidy, who has led in recent polls. In Alaska, meanwhile, about 60 percent of the 3,000 TV ads aired last week were sponsored either by Democratic Sen. Mark Begich or groups supporting his candidacy, such as a super PAC called Put Alaska First and the DSCC. Polls there show a tight race between Begich and Republican Dan Sullivan. The GOP can take solace in two U.S. Senate races--those in Arkansas and Kentucky--where conservatives last week edged liberals in overall TV ads, according to the analysis of Kantar Media/CMAG data. In Arkansas, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Tom Cotton and groups supporting his candidacy aired about 25 percent more TV ads than Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor and his allies. Overall, about 4,100 ads aired in Arkansas, and Team Cotton accounted for about 57 percent of them--about one pro-Cotton or anti-Pryor ad every four and a half minutes. Conservative groups such as super PACs American Crossroads and Freedom Partners Action Fund were responsible for about one of every three ads aired on TV in Arkansas last week--about the same number of ads as Pryor's campaign aired. Meanwhile, in Kentucky, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell battled Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes. The state ranked No. 2 last week among all U.S. Senate races in terms of TV ads, with about 6,400 aired, according to the Center for Public Integrity's analysis of Kantar Media/CMAG data. The North Carolina race, where incumbent Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan faces GOP state House Speaker Thom Tillis, ranked No. 1, attracting about 7,300 TV ads last week. That amounted to more than seven ads every 10 minutes for viewers in the Tar Heel State. In a sign of what could be Republican Terri Lynn Land's waning U.S. Senate fortunes, the Michigan candidate's campaign committee ran just 425 TV ads last week. That's fewer than the nearly 600 ads that super PAC Ending Spending Action Fund ran in support of her candidacy. But it's more than her own party sponsored: No GOP party committees aired TV ads on her behalf last week. Overall, more than 56,000 TV ads ran from Tuesday, Sept. 30, through Monday, Oct. 6, according to a Center for Public Integrity review of Kantar Media/CMAG data. Nearly three-fourths of them aired in nine battleground states that could determine whether Democrats or Republicans control the U.S. Senate next year. No single television station aired more U.S. Senate-specific ads than WMUR-TV 9 in New Hampshire--an ABC affiliate and the Granite State's lone major network-affiliated outlet. With an estimated 757 such ads last week, WMUR easily surpassed runners-up WHO-TV 13 in Des Moines, Iowa, KUSA-TV 9 in Denver, and KTUU-TV 2 in Anchorage, Alaska. Incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen accounted for 220 of WMUR's Senate-focused ads, while Republican challenger Scott Brown accounted for about 200, including more than two dozen produced in conjunction with the NRSC. Granite State viewers were also blitzed by Democratic super PAC Senate Majority PAC, the DSCC, conservative super PAC Ending Spending Action Fund, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ""The dynamic is unique and different, and the number of third-party ads in this race also adds a new layer of intensity and exposure, which is unprecedented,"" said Scott Spradling, a New Hampshire public relations and political consultant who spent 12 years at WMUR as a news anchor and political director. Hearst Corp.-owned WMUR--like any television station or media group experiencing an influx of political ads--is probably all too happy to receive them, Spradling added. ""A contested election year with so many well-funded candidates and groups does nothing but benefit the bottom-line financial situation of media,"" he said.

As Politico reported recently, pessimism brings in the donations, and as the Wall Street Journal confirmed, studies back that up: ""Donors and would-be donors are more likely to click on a fundraising email and contribute if the candidate highlights a recent poll that shows him or her trailing by a narrow margin."" For me, this creates a parallel world to the one where clouds of happy talk billow from campaigns' headquarters. I have been on the phone with a campaign staffer hearing how every sign points to his candidate's success while simultaneously receiving an email from the same campaign claiming that the hordes are cresting over the parapet. Perhaps it's effective, but there's a larger point to be made about political fundraising emails: They are a bouillon cube of all that is awful about American politics--the grasping for money, the neediness, the phony plays on your emotion, the baiting, and reduction of anything complex into its most incendiary form. What makes these emails bad is not the breadth of their insult--you can opt out of receiving them, which makes them easier to avoid than a television commercial--but what it says about the people who send them. Here's the short version: They think you're stupid. ""Unless everyone from Michelle to you--and your neighbor--does his or her part, DEMOCRATS COULD LOSE,"" reads one from Tuesday from the Democratic Governors Association, referring to the first lady. Yesterday I got seven appeals from the DGA. Today, it's been three already. The subject line of one: ""ARRG!"" ""No matter what happens next (and we KNOW there'll be a next), you can do ONE thing right now to stop New Hampshire from falling into Brown's hands,"" reads one from Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. ""Give $5 or more now--before midnight--to stop Brown's bandwagon from stealing New Hampshire."" Here's one that addresses me as ""Dear Patriot,"" and informs me that ""left-wing groups are going all-out to defeat Joni Ernst in Iowa. And I'm sad to say that their efforts are paying off."" Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich, writing for MoveOn.org, is worried, too: ""We're all in deep trouble."" The ones from social conservative activist Gary Bauer are fun: ""Click here now to stop Barack Obama's destruction of America!"" There are hundreds more like this beseeching and screaming in my inbox. Many of them look like ransom letters, with highlighted passages, bold lettering, and SCATTERSHOT CAPITALIZATION. At the current trajectory of mushrooming calamity, I expect to receive a subject line soon that reads: ""This email is coming from inside the house."" Or maybe, ""Donate to this campaign or the dog gets it."" Let's catalog the deceit. The campaigns are purposefully distorting the current state of things in order to take your money. That presumably is good training for getting into office when that becomes a politician's full-time job, but that isn't something we should take lying down. The poll questions candidates ask you in these emails are not intended to glean public opinion for the purposes of shaping policy. They're measuring how much you engaged with their emails and using your answers to figure out what issue will make you likely to donate when they send you the next frantic email about that specific issue. ""Just out of a meeting, John"" reads an email from Rep. Paul Ryan asking for money. I'm sure the congressman is perpetually in a state of being just out of a meeting, but of course he wasn't just out of the meeting he's pretending to have left in order to hit send. ""I've got a critical campaign strategy meeting in a few minutes, so I'll have to be quick,"" writes Mia Love, a congressional candidate in Utah. I asked one of the people under whose name these emails are sent what he thought about having to say such dopey things and he reacted in horror because he hadn't written or seen it. (So don't go framing that missive from Barbra Streisand. It's not from her.) The idea is to make the email seem personal, which is what makes the deception so pernicious. The greasy-smocked minion who cooks up these things tries to slip them past not just your spam filters, but your internal filters. The Obama campaign's online fundraising team spent hours crafting subject lines to make sure you clicked on them. They ruined our lives by coming up with one that simply reads ""Hey,"" which was tremendously successful. ""Hey"" tricks unsuspecting and dimwitted people like me into thinking the note is from a person I actually want to hear from. Email is still a private space where you sometimes get a notice from your kid's teacher or an encouraging word from your wife. You're susceptible to a play on that weakness in your defenses. When you discover you've been duped, the anger burns with no prospect of cooling ointment. These appeals are like phishing scams--but without the occasionally amusing perversion of the language that we get from hackers in Kazakhstan. It would be at least fun if they had some of that. ""I am pleased to be knowing you. Gladly! Jeanne Shaheen considers herself triumphant and we do too. Despair if you do not join us by wiring us your banking numbers so that we might deposit our entire campaign treasury in your bank account until Election Day."" When the emails are not making up fake polls, they traffic in outrage. This is the corrosive permanent condition of our politics. The message in these pleas for cash is remarkably consistent: Someone is somewhere doing something awful, and if he hasn't gotten up to it yet, you can be sure that he'll be minting fresh skullduggery any minute. So stay vigilant! Donate now! It's a vicious circle. To keep everyone outraged requires money, which means more outraged fundraising emails. These emails are not a grand problem, but they operate from this baseline premise: You are not very bright. Your emotions can be easily manipulated, and I will play on those emotions so that I can stay in office or rise to a higher one. When it becomes this easy to lie and manipulate so thoroughly and constantly that it becomes the background music to our politics, it should not simply wash over us without comment. Of course it's hard to know where to register your complaint. You can try to respond to the sender of these emails, but you'll only get a note saying that account doesn't take incoming messages. They're not listening, another way in which these emails mirror our politicians."	Why Political Fundraising Emails Represent Everything That's Wrong With Our Politics
8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/paul_ryan_wants_dynamic_scoring_for_tax_policy_republicans_want_to_change.html	"Last month, in a speech to the Financial Services Roundtable, GOP budget guru Rep. Paul Ryan floated a few ideas for the prospective Republican Senate majority. ""Our rules in Congress require that we don't take into consideration behavioral changes or economic effects as a result of tax reform,"" he said. ""What we want to do is change our measurement."" This is worth a little explanation. Typically, when lawmakers want to know the costs and benefits of a tax proposal, they take it to the Congressional Budget Office for a ""score."" To do this, the CBO projects forward from the proposed policy without accounting for feedback effects or changes to the economy caused by the proposal itself. As the office explains, ""CBO's cost estimates generally do not reflect changes in behavior that would affect total output in the economy, such as any changes in labor supply or private investment resulting from changes in fiscal policy."" That is called static scoring. What Ryan wants is a process called dynamic scoring--that does the opposite: It estimates the effects of a new policy on the economy itself, and uses that to make projections on the eventual costs and benefits of the policy. The main problem with dynamic scoring is it's extremely difficult to do it with real accuracy. To make a fair estimate with dynamic scoring, you have to make big assumptions about a policy and its relationship to the broader economy. And given countless moving parts in a modern economy, it's hard to do this without adding bias, ideological or otherwise. For the CBO and other mainstream analysts, it's more reliable to give a static score of the direct effects of a policy and leave it at that. For Ryan, however, the fuzzy imprecision of dynamic scoring is a point in its favor. Like the late Jack Kemp--his former boss and mentor--Ryan has a firm belief in supply-side economics, which sees a tight connection between marginal tax rates and economic growth. On its own, this isn't controversial. Economists have long said that--depending on circumstances--high tax rates can have a negative effect on growth. But supply-side adherents go further to argue that low taxes always spur enough employment, investment, and growth to expand the tax base and grow revenue beyond the size of the tax cut. To Ryan, and many others in the Republican Party, you can have your cake (and pie and barbecue) and eat it, too. Dynamic scoring is key to the supply-side case. With the right assumptions, a dynamic score can make tax cuts the free lunch of public policy. For example, in his 2012 Path to Prosperity, Ryan said that his tax cuts and budgetary policies would create ""nearly 1 million new private-sector jobs,"" bring the unemployment rate down to ""4 percent by 2015,"" and increase ""real GDP by $1.5 trillion over the decade."" The proof? A dynamic score calculated by the right-wing Heritage Foundation. Indeed, like snake oil salesmen at a medicine show, conservatives have long used dynamic scoring to make extraordinary claims about the alleged power of tax cuts. As a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, Texas Gov. Rick Perry proposed a $1 trillion tax cut as a cure for the sluggish economy. ""Gov. Perry is confident that the economic growth that results from this plan will generate the necessary revenue to balance the budget by 2020,"" said the campaign in an interview with the Washington Post, citing its dynamic score for the plan. According to an independent analysis, however, the Perry plan would have been a huge revenue loser, starving the government of tax dollars and forcing cuts to a wide variety of programs. Likewise, Republicans used dynamic scoring to sell the 2003 Bush tax cuts as a lunch that would pay for itself--the tonic for a slow-moving economy. ""The president's growth package will reduce the tax burden on the American people by $98 billion this year, $670 billion over the next 10 years,"" said Vice President Dick Cheney. ""But the actual impact on the deficit will be considerably smaller than the static projections, because the president's package will generate new growth, it will expand the tax base, and thus increase tax revenue to the federal government ultimately."" Of course, none of this happened. Far from broad-based gains, the Bush tax cuts added trillions to long-term debt, worsened economic inequality, and set the stage for the next five years of sluggish growth, culminating in a massive recession. Despite this example, Republican governors like Kansas' Sam Brownback have embarked on an orgy of supply-side tax cutting, and congressional Republicans have pushed bills to establish dynamic scoring for the Congressional Budget Office. (In fairness, a handful of Democrats joined Republicans to do the same in 2013, giving bipartisan cover for the bad idea.) Which brings us back to Paul Ryan. For the House Budget Committee chairman, it's still tax cuts uber alles--for his most recent budget, he proposed a whole new round of tax cuts, along with huge reductions to spending on low-income Americans. The only way to make this work as public relations--let alone policy--is to paint a picture of prosperity and success. Give us these tax cuts, the argument goes, and we'll supercharge the economy with growth. For this, dynamic scoring is necessary. And so, if Republicans win control of Congress, we can count on a few years of nonsense numbers, as the GOP sells bad policies with wishful thinking."

9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/julia_pierson_resigns_a_2013_inspector_general_report_detailed_all_of_the.html	"Julia Pierson called it quits Wednesday, stepping down as director of the U.S. Secret Service just 18 months after she took the job and one day after her dismal performance in front of Congress failed to appease lawmakers angry about the recent White House security breach. In announcing the news, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson promised an independent review of the failures that allowed Omar Gonzalez to hop the fence at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. and dash into the executive mansion, with a ""review of broader issues concerning the Secret Service"" a possibility as well. The decision to launch an external review was long overdue. But Johnson shouldn't need an outside panel to tell him what should be obvious by now: Concerns about the Secret Service extend far beyond the Sept. 19 incident at the White House, and Pierson's departure alone won't fix problems that began before her tenure. While this week's string of high-profile embarrassments has made that abundantly clear, it shouldn't have taken someone hopping a fence to put the spotlight on the troubled agency. The Department of Homeland Security's Inspector General's Office provided a rare--albeit somewhat redacted--peek inside the Secret Service this past December when it released a report following the agency's Colombian prostitution scandal the previous year. The report should have raised a giant red flag for anyone paying attention. Instead, it went largely overlooked thanks to its official conclusion that there was nothing to suggest that ""misconduct [was] widespread"" within the Secret Service. Dig past the executive summary and you'll find a huge disconnect between the IG's conclusion and the evidence that comes before it. The report found that between 2004 and 2012, there had been nearly 800 documented cases of misconduct within the agency, ranging from disruptive behavior to problems with drugs or alcohol. The report doesn't provide details of the incidents, but 257 of the offenses were classified as ""neglect of duty,"" a rather broad catchall that includes both the failure to carry out orders on time and the failure to carry them out at all. Other offenses that fall under that category include: ""sleeping on the job,"" ""inattention to duty,"" and ""negligent or careless performance of assigned duties."" In other words, a member of the Secret Service has been caught sleeping on the job, either literally or figuratively, on average nearly every other week for the past decade. There's reason to believe that the true total is higher: An electronic survey given to members of the Secret Service found that 18 percent of respondents--almost one in five--said they believe ""management tolerates violations of misconduct."" While the Secret Service has taken a few small steps to address the problems documented in the report, it's telling that officials were so eager to believe there wasn't anything to really worry about. It's likely that many of the offenses that are enumerated in the IG report turned out to be relatively harmless. But we could have said the same thing about any number of the mistakes made on Sept. 19 if it weren't for the fact that they overlapped with Omar Gonzalez's decision to hop the White House fence, dash across the North Lawn, barge through the North Portico's doors, and push past an on-duty officer before finally being tackled by a serendipitously placed off-duty agent who had just finished his work day. Perfection may be an unfair standard to demand of the agents and officers willing to give their lives in the line of duty. But it's clear that the Secret Service hasn't come anywhere close to meeting that standard, and hasn't seemed all that concerned about that fact. For all the agency's behind-the-scenes screw-ups, it took a prominent public event for anyone to notice this broader dysfunction. According to the Secret Service, in the past five years, 16 people have jumped the White House fence, including six this year alone. All were nabbed by security. Yet, it was the agency's failure to extend its shutout streak by one last month that rightly prompted a crisis of confidence in the Secret Service, one that ultimately cost Pierson her job. The release of an IG report 10 months ago that documented hundreds of individual failures, though, prompted the nation to shrug its shoulders and move on. Of course, reports don't often drive action in Washington, and sensational anecdotes do. The Secret Service has offered plenty of those, too. Earlier this year an agent was found drunk and passed out in a hotel hallway in Amsterdam the day before Obama was set to arrive. In 2012 a dozen agents spent a boozy night in Cartagena in the company of prostitutes. And in 2009 an agent on a presidential detail in Asia had to be retrieved by a superior after spending a drunken night in a Thai brothel. The theme of alcohol isn't a coincidence: Excessive drinking was one of a handful of problems a plurality of respondents labeled ""more than isolated but less than systemic"" in the IG's survey. Take all that together, and no one should have been shocked to learn this past week that it took officials four days--and the help of a housekeeper--to figure out that someone had deliberately unloaded more than half a dozen rounds at the White House in 2011. Or that only a few days before Gonzalez hopped the fence, the Secret Service had unknowingly allowed Obama to share an elevator with a gun-toting security contractor with a criminal record. The Obama administration is hinting at major reforms to an agency that clearly needs them. Let's hope it delivers. Because while Pierson's resignation couldn't come fast enough given her misleading testimony before Congress, there's little to suggest her departure will make the Secret Service any less secretive--or the president any safer."

""This failure has once again tested the trust of the American people in the Secret Service--a trust already strained by a string of recent scandals,"" Republican House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa said early in the hearing, providing what would become a common refrain from both sides of the aisle. Proving this was far from a one-sided partisan attack, Democrat Rep. Stephen Lynch unleashed perhaps the most blistering one-liner, telling Pierson, ""I wish to God that you protected the White House like you're protecting your reputation here today."" Tuesday's hearing was full of what can make Congress so frustrating to watch: political grandstanding, off-topic partisan bickering, the demanding of answers without giving witnesses the time to answer questions, and even pointless props. When Issa gaveled the hearing to a close in the early afternoon, it was unclear if the panel had made even the smallest headway toward preventing future security failures at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Still, for all the look-at-how-angry-I-am posturing and the long-winded soliloquies, the hearing was nonetheless a success. This was an example of lawmakers doing a job only they could do, not in spite of their desire for political theater but because of it. On Sept. 19, Iraq War veteran Omar Gonzalez jumped the White House fence and made it inside the residence. The Washington Post's Carol D. Leonnig reported on Tuesday that Gonzalez ""made it much farther into the building than previously known, overpowering one Secret Service officer and running through much of the main floor."" He was finally corralled in the East Room after passing the stairs that lead to the White House's living quarters. At the hearing, Pierson began by taking ""full responsibility"" for her agents' ""unacceptable"" failure to properly execute the established security plan. She then took significant care not to go much further than that. Pierson was somewhat limited in what she could discuss because much of the Secret Service's protocol is (understandably) classified, but her desire to protect her agency and specific agents was evident in her long, monotone responses, which avoided the type of yes-or-no answers that lawmakers asked for when it came to simple questions of fact. The closed-door briefing that was scheduled to follow likely proved significantly more informative for lawmakers. But the public hearing-turned-public scolding wasn't just for show. For starters, the hearing provided the much-needed official rebuke to the Secret Service that President Obama has been unable to deliver. This is an agency, after all, that is directly responsible for the safety of the president and his family at a time when he's reportedly receiving three times the death threats of his predecessors. Obama, like any president, can't run the risk of alienating the very agents he entrusts with his family's lives. It's no surprise then that the White House has treaded carefully despite what was by all accounts a serious and stunning security lapse. ""The president and the first lady, like all parents, are concerned about the safety of their children,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said following the incident, ""but the president and the first lady also have confidence in the men and women of the Secret Service to do a very important job."" That tepid show of support aside, there are plenty of reasons why the president should be concerned--and not just because Gonzalez managed to break through five layers of security on his way into the White House, despite twice being questioned by Secret Service agents this summer. Prior to her Tuesday report, the Post's Leonnig published a damning piece this past weekend that documented the agency's lackluster response to a 2011 shooting at the White House, in which a man named Oscar Ortega-Hernandez unloaded more than a half-dozen rounds at the building while Sasha Obama was inside. The Secret Service initially shrugged off the gunfire as either a shootout between rival gangs or the backfiring of a car, this despite a bevy of evidence suggesting it was a deliberate attack on the White House. While Gonzalez may have been the first fence-jumper to make it inside, he wasn't the first intruder to crash the White House: Real Housewives of D.C. cast members Michaele and Tareq Salahi memorably managed to slip past security and into a state dinner in 2009. And the Secret Service's embarrassments aren't confined to American soil: There was the agency's prostitution scandal in Colombia in 2012, and this spring's drunken escapades in the Netherlands. If the president isn't concerned, he should be. It's been at least as troubling that the Secret Service has provided scant and sometimes inaccurate information about its response to both the fence jumping and the 2011 shooting, the details of which were largely unknown until this weekend's Washington Post expose. In the immediate aftermath of the fence jumping, an agency spokesperson told the Associated Press that Gonzalez was unarmed when he was apprehended. An affidavit later filed by an agent, however, revealed that Gonzalez had a knife with a 31/2-inch serrated blade. That affidavit also echoed what was at the time the official agency line that Gonzalez had been apprehended almost immediately after entering the White House through the North Portico doors, a story the Post's reporting contradicted. The details of Gonzalez's foray into the White House remained unconfirmed by the agency until lawmakers were able to pose the questions directly to Pierson in Tuesday's hearing. There's an increasing amount of evidence, then, that suggests Pierson and her agency have attempted to mislead the American public. The director had plenty of opportunities to set the record straight on Tuesday, but nonetheless kept another crucial detail hidden. The agent who ultimately tackled Gonzalez wasn't on duty at the time, but instead had ended his shift moments earlier after seeing Obama and his daughters depart for Camp David via helicopter. The only reason that detail is now public is thanks to the Post's Leonnig, who reported it in a story that published as the hearing was wrapping up. Pierson didn't just evade questions from the House Oversight Committee. She also appears to have misled her interlocutors. Leonnig and the Washington Examiner broke yet another story on Tuesday, this time reporting that an armed security contractor with three prior convictions for assault and battery was allowed to ride in an elevator with the president during his Sept. 16 visit to Atlanta--a violation of Secret Service protocol that Obama was never informed of during his trip. Pierson told lawmakers that she briefs the president ""100 percent of the time"" when his personal security has been breached, saying that there's been only one such breach this year: Gonzalez's dash through the White House. According to Leonnig, meanwhile, Pierson ""took steps to have the [Atlanta] matter reviewed internally and did not refer it to an investigative unit that reviews violations of protocol and standard."" If it wasn't for Leonnig, we wouldn't know about many of the Secret Service's failings and evasions. But without Tuesday's public hearing, Pierson and her agency likely would have been able to continue to hide behind nuance and obfuscation. Instead, the Secret Service chief is now on the record, and that record--limited as it may be--is already causing her headaches. The hearing may have looked like the latest round of outrage-for-the-sake-of-outrage political theater, but in reality it was much more. Sometimes, we should be thankful for grandstanding politicians."	Congress' Public Shaming of the Secret Service Was Political Grandstanding at Its Best

Aiming at a broad electorate, candidates are looking for issues where the public agrees with them and dodging issues where they might lose votes. Democrats aren't talking much about President Obama, and nobody's gloating about the economy. But on social issues, the tide of cowardice is running the other way: Republicans are mumbling, cringing, and ducking. They don't want the election to be about these issues, even in red states. Let's take a look at some recent encounters. Watch the Democrats attack and the Republicans squirm. Virginia, July 26. Democratic Sen. Mark Warner faced Republican challenger Ed Gillespie in their first debate. The moderator asked about same-sex marriage. Gillespie said that while he preferred the one-man-one-woman formula, ""It's not my role to legislate on it, because I do believe that the appropriate venue for it is the state."" Warner gave a more direct answer: ""I support marriage equality."" Then Warner added:"	Republicans No Longer Want to Debate Abortion, Gay Marriage, or Contraception
12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/joni_ernst_is_a_far_right_conservative_the_gop_s_iowa_senate_candidate_is.html	"If the Iowa Senate election were held today, Joni Ernst--the Republican nominee--would win. In the latest Des Moines Register poll, she leads by six points--44 percent to 38 percent for Democrat Bruce Braley. Who is Ernst? An Iowa state senator, she's served more than two decades in the Army Reserves and Iowa National Guard, and has held her state senate seat since 2011. By all appearances, she's a mainstream Republican candidate, with support from Mitt Romney, Sarah Palin, the Chamber of Commerce, and a primary endorsement from the Des Moines Register, which called her ""a smart, well-prepared candidate who can wrestle with the details of public policy from a conservative perspective without seeming inflexible."" With that praise for her policy chops, you'd think Ernst was running a substantive campaign. She isn't. Far from endorsing smart policy ideas or offering constructive solutions, Ernst is running on her biography, emphasizing her roles as ""Mother. Soldier. Independent leader."" To that end, she had little to say about actual policy during Sunday night's Senate debate. ""We have to address those problems, and we need to look at many options out there--I haven't endorsed one option or another,"" she said. There's nothing new in bland, personality-driven campaigns. To some extent (remove the ""bland"") it describes Barack Obama's 2008 effort, and this year, it defines campaigns for red state Democrats who need to show their commitment to voters without alienating those on the fence. The problem with Ernst, however, is that she does have policy ideas--and they are far, far outside the mainstream. So much so that she exists on the radical edge of the Republican Party, with polarizing views on almost everything under the sun. She's not quite Sarah Palin part deux, but she's close. Take the minimum wage. Ernst is against the national minimum wage and believes it should be the full responsibility of the states. ""I do believe that is something that needs to be set by the states, because our Iowa cost of living is very low,"" she said during Sunday's debate. ""Currently it is at $7.25 an hour, and I'm someone that worked the minimum wage way back when, when it was much lower,"" she said. From that, it's a little unclear if she thinks $7.25 is appropriate for a minimum wage. An earlier comment, from August, is more clarifying. ""I think $7.25 is a great starter wage for many high school students. They are just getting into work,"" she said. The problem is easy to see: Most minimum wage workers aren't teenagers, and a substantial number have children of their own. Even in an inexpensive state like Iowa, $15,000 a year--the annual income for a full-time minimum wage worker--is below the poverty line for a family of four. What's more, according to a survey from the liberal Center for American Progress, most Iowans disagree. Fifty-seven percent believe there should be a federal minimum wage, 53 percent support raising it to $10.10 an hour, and 80 percent agree the current minimum wage isn't enough to support a family. Beyond economic policy, Ernst has pandered to the far-right edges of Iowa politics. Indeed, notes Meredith Shiner for Yahoo News, she's ""in the precarious position of being an establishment-backed candidate who owes her shot at a national office to some of the most conservative voters in the country."" Among other stances, Ernst has endorsed impeachment for President Obama, expressed the belief that states could nullify federal laws, and supported ""personhood"" anti-abortion laws that would outlaw most forms of contraception. In addition, she's slammed Medicaid recipients for not taking ""personal responsibility for their health""--even though recipients have to apply for coverage--and talked extensively about ""Agenda 21,"" a decades-old U.N. recommendation for environmental sustainability that forms the basis for conspiracy-mongering on the far right. ""The United Nations has imposed this upon us, and as a U.S. senator, I would say, 'No more. No more Agenda 21,' "" she said during a January forum for GOP Senate candidates. Of all of Ernst's positions, her most mainstream is support for private accounts in Social Security, which has intellectual respectability in the GOP, even as it's opposed by most Americans. Arguably, none of this matters. The Senate has become an almost parliamentary body, with lockstep unity on most issues. If elected to the Senate, Ernst would join with Sen. Mitch McConnell on almost every vote; that she happens to believe conspiracy theories doesn't change the fact that she's a Republican first and foremost. But for as much as both sides walk in lockstep, individual senators still retain a tremendous amount of influence, from power over legislation and nominees to substantial media attention. A senator who wants to can bring an issue into the national conversation: Think Sen. Rand Paul and drone warfare, or Sen. Ted Cruz and his crusade against the Affordable Care Act. Above and beyond their party affiliation, it mattered that Paul was a libertarian and Cruz was an avatar for the Tea Party base. A Joni Ernst who moves away from the far right of Iowa politics is one who might enter the Senate with sobriety in mind--a Sen. Tim Scott, not a Sen. Jim DeMint. But if she embraces these views, or feels indebted to the bomb-throwers and radicals, we'd have more than just another Republican senator--we'd have a destructive one."

This wasn't a policy seminar or think tank event, it was a party rally and Bush had one job--to give red meat and boost enthusiasm for a flailing campaign. And he failed. Speaking to an audience of conservative North Carolinians, Bush made the case for immigration reform--""Fixing a system that doesn't work is a big thing that I think will restore and sustain economic growth for this country""--and voiced his support for Common Core standards, a verboten stance among Republican voters. That put Tillis in the uncomfortable position of needing to distance himself from his advocate, telling Bush that--on immigration--""You have to make it clear that amnesty shouldn't be on the table,"" and attacking the federal Department of Education as ""a bureaucracy of 5,000 people in Washington."" The New York Times called this ""rough,"" and it was--the tone-deaf showing of an amateur. Which gets to the problem of Jeb Bush. At every turn, the former Florida governor is hailed as a savior for the Republican Party, and for good reason. Even with the baggage of his brother, he brings powerful advantages, from the network of the Bush dynasty and fundraising prowess, to policy chops, potential Latino support (on account of his time in Florida), and the enthusiasm of the GOP establishment. But as almost anyone can tell you, there's a huge step between ""good on paper"" and good, and, judging from his recent performance, it's hard to say that Bush stands as a genuinely good candidate. Instead, he seems like a cipher--a vessel for the hopes and wishes of wealthy Republican donors, who fear another cycle of embarrassing candidates and lackluster campaigns. The Tillis affair is representative of Bush's flaws as a candidate. A more talented politician would have tailored his message to his audience. Indeed, it doesn't take a savant to know that--if you're supportive--immigration and Common Core are areas to avoid with a conservative audience. But then, Bush isn't in the same world as rivals like Sen. Ted Cruz, Sen. Rand Paul, or even Gov. Chris Christie. Since leaving office, Bush has lived in the realm of corporate philanthropy, where wealthy executives give huge sums for a variety of unconservative causes, like climate change and Common Core. It's a world of vocal centrism, where Michael Bloomberg is esteemed and the fights are for gun control and calorie labeling, not traditional values and the repeal of Obamacare. It's possible that Bush could abandon this and shape himself into a warrior for Republican conservatism. But I doubt it. As a major advocate for Common Core (his Foundation for Excellence has collected millions from pro-Common Core groups) and immigration reform, he's too removed from the world of conservative politics to adapt. And even if he could make the shift, he'd have to stand against more genuine competitors like Sen. Marco Rubio and (potentially) Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Put another way, even after Bush flipped on a path to citizenship last year, he was still behind the curve on anti-immigration rhetoric. Here are the facts: Jeb Bush has been out of the political game for almost a decade. If he had the intensity of a Richard Nixon or a Ronald Reagan--who had long respites from national politics before winning the presidency--it would be different. But he hasn't done the usual work of regular campaigning and fundraising that defines the active candidate. If there's a fire that defines a presidential contender, he doesn't seem to have it. In that sense, he's worse off than even Mitt Romney, who continues to crave the presidency; according to the Washington Examiner's Byron York, he's floated himself as a player for 2016, the Adlai Stevenson (or William Jennings Bryan) of the 21st century.* Yes, Republican elites want a champion. But in Jeb Bush, they don't have a fighter, they have a Fred Thompson. For a genuine contender, they'll have to look elsewhere. Correction, Sept. 29, 2014: This article originally misspelled the last name of three-time Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan."

14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/omar_gonzalez_white_house_intruder_the_secret_service_did_almost_everything.html	"This past Friday evening, 42-year-old Omar Gonzalez scaled the 9-foot-high iron fencing that surrounds the White House, dashed across the North Lawn, and made it through the unlocked doors of the North Portico before finally being apprehended by the Secret Service. While much of the White House security protocol is (understandably) classified, it's safe to assume that things didn't go according to plan. As Marc Ambinder put it in Politico Magazine: ""Under no circumstances should anyone be able to vault over the fence and run, unimpeded, into the residence."" I have no quibbles with that conclusion, and neither does the Secret Service. The agency's director, Julia Pierson, has ordered an internal review, and at least one painfully obvious fix has already been implemented: The White House will now lock its front door. More reforms will likely follow, especially given that Pierson will be hauled before Congress next week to explain the high-profile breach. But before that happens, it's worth pausing for a second to acknowledge something the Secret Service got right amidst all they did wrong: not a single shot was fired. Gonzalez, an Iraq war veteran who is likely mentally ill, is still alive. As I argued during this summer's unrest in Ferguson, officers too often shoot first and ask questions later, if they ask them at all. Far too often, the police and the media alike will shrug their shoulders and declare a shooting to be justified without considering whether it was avoidable. Drawing that distinction is crucial. It forces us to remember that even in the most fraught circumstances, police officers and federal agents don't have to fire their weapons simply because they can. Gonzalez's run across the White House lawn is proof of that. The Secret Service's show of restraint is all the more praiseworthy because it stands in stark contrast to a number of recent questionable police shootings. The killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson has drawn the most attention, but the Missouri teen's death was far from an isolated incident. Later that same month, St. Louis police shot and killed a 25-year-old black man, Kajieme Powell, who was acting erratically outside a convenience store. The following week, in the parking lot of a hardware store in Ottawa, Kansas, officers shot and killed a white 18-year-old, Joseph Jennings, who had recently been treated at a nearby hospital for an apparent suicide attempt. That same month police shot and killed a 22-year-old black man, John Crawford III, who was holding an air rifle inside an Ohio Walmart. And just three weeks ago, a South Carolina officer opened fire on a 25-year-old black man, Levar Jones, who was reaching for his license as instructed by police. Each case is different, but all should leave us wondering what would have happened if the officers held their fire. This isn't just a problem at the local level. A New York Times investigation revealed last year that FBI agents fatally shot about 70 people between 1993 and early 2011. Every single episode was deemed justified by the bureau, despite the fact that some of those shootings were clearly avoidable. Consider the case of then-20-year-old Joseph Schultz, who was shot in the jaw in 2002 after an agent mistook him for a suspect in a bank robbery. Every police shooting deserves to be put under a microscope. But if we're going to do that, it's only fair to point out when the authorities avoid killing a man when most everyone would have called it justifiable. If an agent would have shot Gonzalez, it's unlikely that decision would have been second-guessed--particularly given that, according to an affidavit filed by the Secret Service, he was carrying a knife with a 31/2-inch serrated blade. The agents appear to have been unaware that Gonzalez had a knife, but it nonetheless would've been safe to assume in the moment that he posed a real danger. The man had breached the White House's perimeter, after all. Indeed, the agents' decision not to shoot has been one of many Secret Service (in)actions to draw criticism. ""In my mind, if somebody comes over the White House fence, and is running toward the White House, I just assume: shoot 'em, take 'em down,"" Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, told a local news station. Ronald Kessler, writing in Time, came to a similar conclusion. ""They were either asleep or just not paying attention when [Gonzalez] sprinted across the lawn,"" the conservative journalist wrote, before concluding: ""Having failed to unleash the dogs in time, the officers should have taken out the intruder with a bullet."" (The National Review, meanwhile, used the incident to offer their readers the helpful PSA that ""you have the right to use violence to defend yourself and your property."") When you consider that pervasive shoot-first-then-keep-shooting mindset, the fact that agents held their fire is all the more laudable. The Secret Service is typically afforded more latitude to use deadly force than other branches of law enforcement, which makes sense given that they are protecting the country's elected leader. (The gravity of their duty is implicit in the fact that we expect agents not only to take a life to protect the president but also to give theirs if necessary.) While President Obama had departed for Camp David before Gonzalez stepped foot in the White House, it would have taken just one of the many agents at the scene to decide that national security was at risk and that he had no other choice than to open fire. That's one reason why nonshootings like this one are so remarkable. To take a life, only one officer needs to pull the trigger. To save a life, all of them must hold back. You could argue that, in hindsight, the Secret Service should have been more concerned about Gonzalez. He had two earlier run-ins with the agency this summer, and the officers who searched his car following Friday's incident found 800 rounds of ammunition, two hatchets, and a machete. But those troubling details must be set aside when we think about the agents' collective decision not to shoot. The Secret Service's show of restraint was a result of split-second decisions made with little available information. What's more relevant is the fact that Gonzalez appears to be suffering from PTSD-like symptoms. Secret Service agents say that after he was taken into custody, he told them he jumped the fence because ""the atmosphere was collapsing and [he] needed to get the information to the President of the United States so that he could get the word out to the people."" It's unclear whether Secret Service agents are specifically trained to deal with the mentally ill. But Pierson's comments earlier this week suggest that, if nothing else, they are at least conscious that a mentally ill suspect is likely to act differently than one who is not. ""To be quite honest with you all, the vast majority of the people we come into contact with exhibit signs of mental illness,"" the director explained to reporters. According to Pierson, her agents deal with roughly 60 people a year outside the White House who appear to be potential threats, most of whom never attempt to breach the gates. But some do. Two days after Gonzalez was taken into custody, agents arrested a man who attempted to enter the White House both on foot and through a vehicle-screening area. And earlier this month, a man wearing a Pikachu hat and carrying a Pokemon doll jumped the White House's north fence before being stopped by officers. Neither incident resulted in serious injury to the suspects or anyone else. No two cases are the same, and I have never worn a police uniform, let alone been put in the incredibly difficult position of having to decide in a flash whether to shoot or hold my fire. But the bottom line remains that the Secret Service made the judgment call not to open fire, and if they had, the outcome would have been far worse. As the agency is questioned about its many failures, let's also highlight what it did right. Friday's events could serve as an important lesson to everyone in law enforcement: Just because a shooting is justified doesn't mean it needs to happen."	The Secret Service Didn't Shoot That White House Intruder. That's Worth Celebrating.
15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/voter_id_s_real_roots_is_it_racism_or_hyper_partisanship.html	"Despite condemnation from civil rights groups, federal officials, and the president of the United States, most Americans--including blacks--support voter identification laws. But like most public opinion, this view is highly contingent and contextual. Ask a different question--or give a different scenario--and you'll get a different result. A new survey--from University of Delaware's Center for Political Communication--makes that incredibly clear. In the study, which used a representative sample of 1,436 adults, respondents were randomly assigned to one of three groups. The first group received a statement about voter ID laws--""Voter ID laws require individuals to show a form of government issued identification when they attempt to vote""--followed by a question, ""What is your opinion? Do you strongly favor voter ID laws, favor voter ID laws, oppose voter ID laws, or strongly oppose voter ID laws?"" The second group received the statement and the question, as well as an image of a white person at a voting machine. And the third group received the same statement and the same question, but an image of a black person at a voting machine. In every group, a majority supported voter identification. But while respondents in the ""no image"" and ""white image"" groups gave 67 percent support for the measures, respondents in the ""black image"" group gave 73 percent support. Now, this isn't a substantial change--from, for instance, a small plurality to a solid majority--but it is a significant one. As researcher David C. Wilson notes, ""Our findings suggest that public opinion about voter ID laws can be racialized by simply showing images of African-American people. The resulting increase in support for the laws happens independently of--even after controlling for--political ideology and negative attitudes about African-Americans."" For some Americans, in other words, just seeing blacks voting increases their support for voter identification laws. What's interesting about this study--besides its immediate conclusions--is how it fits into an emerging picture of what motivates voter ID laws. For as much as proponents say they want to stop voter fraud and protect ballot ""integrity,"" more and more research suggests race as a critical factor in where these laws emerge, and who supports them. Take a study conducted earlier this year by Christian Grose, a political scientist at the University of South California, and Matthew Mendez, a graduate student. Grose and Mendez wanted to see how bias factored into representation and constituent response--would a lawmaker who supported voter ID still respond to her minority constituents, or would she ignore them? To that end, they sent emails to legislators in 14 states with large Latino populations, asking what documentation they needed to vote. This was the email template: Hello (Representative/Senator NAME), My name is (voter NAME) and I have heard a lot in the news lately about identification being required at the polls. I do not have a driver's license. Can I still vote in November? Thank you for your help. Sincerely, (voter NAME) What's important to know is that these were states where a license wasn't needed--recipients could just answer yes and move on. One group of legislators received emails from a voter called ""Jacob Smith,"" while the other received email from a ""Santiago Rodriguez."" What's more, one-half of the emails were in Spanish and one-half were in English. In measuring the data, Grose and Mendez found that lawmakers who supported voter ID were substantially less likely to respond to the Latino constituent; roughly 45 percent of voter ID supporters replied to ""Smith"" versus the roughly 27 percent who replied to ""Rodriguez."" There was a difference among voter ID opponents as well, but it was small--under 10 percent. From this, we can't know if bias prompted the lawmakers to support voter ID, but--as Grose notes in an interview with NPR--""It's fair to say the Republicans who sponsored such bills seem to be biased when it comes to responding to the Latino name versus the Anglo name."" Likewise, a 2013 study from researchers Keith G. Bentele and Erin E. O'Brien found a tight relationship between race, Republicans, and voter ID. If a state elected a Republican governor, increased its share of Republican legislators, or became more competitive while under a Republican, it was more likely to pass voter ID and other restrictions on the franchise. Moreover, states with ""unencumbered Republican majorities"" and large black populations were especially likely to pass identification laws. For Bentele and O'Brien, this comes down to partisanship. ""These findings demonstrate that the emergence and passage of restrictive voter access legislation is unambiguously a highly partisan affair, influenced by the intensity of electoral competition,"" they write. Even with the context of the other studies, I think this is right. Voter ID boosters don't hold anti-minority animus as much as they want to maximize political advantage. As Judge Richard Posner wrote in a recent dissent against the Wisconsin voter ID law, ""There is only one motivation for imposing burdens on voting that are ostensibly designed to discourage voter-impersonation fraud, if there is no actual danger of such fraud, and that is to discourage voting by persons likely to vote against the party responsible for imposing the burdens."" Indeed, this ultra-partisanship helps explain the apparent reaction against minorities in the Delware and Southern California studies. If black Americans are Democratic voters and voter ID opponents, and you're asked to take a stand on voter ID in the context of black voting, then you might show more support, if you're a Republican voter. It's not racial, it's tribal. But it's hard to say this matters. No, voter ID supporters might not hold racial animus, but they end up in the same place as a racist who does: Supporting laws that restrict the vote and hurt minorities."	What Are the Real Roots Behind Voter ID--Racism or Partisanship?
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/alison_lundergan_grimes_and_mitch_mcconnell_senate_debate_which_kentucky.html	"It has been painful to watch most of the debates between Senate candidates this election season. Imagine a game show in which representatives from each party are forced to strap on roller skates for the first time and are then compelled to stuff as many talking points as possible into each answer as they wobble back and forth. But the debate Monday night between the two candidates running for Senate in Kentucky was better than most. Both were firmly seated, and engaged in a free-flowing exchange that was prodded along by a single moderator who asked smart follow-ups. It wasn't perfect, but it was a model of the form. The debate also provided a model of what makes our politics so discouraging: The candidates retreated to disingenuous evasions that were at once familiar--candidates evade questions all the time--and notable because they seemed so brazen. One was a policy elision from Sen. Mitch McConnell, and one was a personal smokescreen from Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes. They are equivalent only in that they are both diversions. Whether one is worse than the other depends on your view of politics. Some people weigh candor about a personal matter more heavily than candor about policy. Fibs about personal matters are usually easier to spot in real time and require less context. Plus, policy is complicated, and good people can disagree. On the other hand, there is no direct policy impact in a personal evasion, whereas a policy hoodwink affects, or could affect, a great number of people in a direct way that changes lives. I will address them in the order in which they appeared. Grimes: When she was asked whether she voted for President Obama, Grimes ducked the question, saying that it was a matter of principle that she shouldn't have to disclose her vote. It's possible that Grimes really feels bound to this position, though when most people think about the sanctity of the ballot, it's usually the idea that no government or person can compel you to say how you voted. But as McConnell pointed out, how you voted is not a fact that dare not speak its name. (Update, Oct. 15, 2014: Which is why Grimes said she voted for Clinton in 2008). You are free to let people know. So Grimes appears to be creating a principle to hide a political liability, which is her past support for a very unpopular president. It's one thing to shift and wiggle. It's worse to pretend your gyrations are based on a sacred commandment, especially when they aren't. It's not only disingenuous, but it contributes to the overall view that principles are playthings, which diminishes their effectiveness when real policies are on the line. Lots of commenters said it was a politically stupid thing for Grimes to do, too. That is less clear. It's doubtful this political tap dance routine affects the thinking of a great number of Kentucky voters: Those who don't like Grimes see this as proof of their previous views. Those who do like her (or don't like McConnell) probably won't let an awkward evasion get in the way of their established opinions. More important, the evasion as it stands is mainly a fixation of Washington reporters and Twitter elites. If you're McConnell, you can't turn that into an ad that lots of voters could see. When the president recently said his policies were on the ballot, McConnell's team put the footage into an ad almost instantaneously. If Grimes had admitted she voted for Obama, it would have provided her opponent with a fresh clip for his next advertisement. That moment would have been replayed again and again for the next three weeks. But Grimes wasn't forswearing all presidents: Grimes says she considers herself a Clinton Democrat rather than an Obama Democrat because Clinton's policies represented ""growing the middle class the right way. And that's by making sure that we are building from the foundation up."" For those keeping score at home, that's a complete condemnation of Obama's economic policies by a Democrat. McConnell: The Senate minority leader was asked about Kentucky Kynect, the state's federal exchange set up as a part of the Affordable Care Act: ""Has Obamacare and Kynect been a boon or bane for the majority of Kentuckians?"" McConnell didn't answer the question because he disagreed with its premise. He said Kynect was just a website and that it would be ""fine"" if it continued, but that he still believes that Obamacare should be pulled out ""root and branch."" This too is a disingenuous answer. McConnell is trying to retain those voters who disapprove of Obamacare while not doing anything to offend those who like the popular program that has insured 500,000 people across the state. He doesn't want to inspire new voters to turn out against him by making it seem like their new health care plans are under threat. How can he do this? By being intentionally vague and defining the state program in a very limited way. When McConnell says it's fine for Kynect to continue, it might sound to the casual viewer that he's OK with the current system. But what he means is that the actual website can continue--literally the servers and the URL--and everything else can be replaced by some other system. He does not go into detail about what that new system would be in practical terms. But we've all learned that health care websites and policies are closely intermingled. In fact, McConnell helped teach us that. He was an articulate critic of the president during the collapse of healthcare.gov. ""The president likes to say that Obamacare is about more than just a website,"" McConnell said during the period of healthcare.gov's initial collapse. ""He's absolutely right. And that's why fixing a website won't solve the larger problem here."" Websites and policies are tied together. The policies that McConnell supports would make Kynect impossible in its current form because if you did away with Obamacare, as he proposes, the system would collapse into a death spiral. The mandates and subsides that allow the exchange to function would be gone. Striking down Obamacare would also remove the Medicaid subsidy that has covered people through Kynect. At several other instances during the debate, McConnell went into some detail about the havoc that is wrought on Kentucky by federal actions both real and imagined. In this case, however, he doesn't admit that Kynect in its current form would disappear. McConnell can make a case that the coming GOP majority will have a health care plan in 2015 that will replace Obamacare and be even better, but that's quite a different argument--and full of politically unhelpful uncertainty--than the position he took. McConnell left the impression with viewers--and those who have taken advantage of the exchange--that the thing they liked could continue even if Obamacare died. These would be great issues to discuss in a future debate, but unfortunately this is the only time Grimes and McConnell plan to square off. Of course, voters can stop them on the street and ask for clarifications. They've got three weeks until Election Day."	Which Kentucky Senate Candidate Was More Disingenuous?
17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/republican_and_democratic_election_mind_games_the_psychological_warfare.html	"With three weeks until Election Day, each party is choosing its metaphors. ""Our job is to get as many races on the table as possible,"" says a Democratic strategist involved in this fall's midterm elections, ""create as many opportunities as possible, create as much confusion as possible, and then hope that at the end of the day enough Plinkos get all the way down the Price Is Right board to hit the jackpot."" The jackpot, in this case, is keeping control of the Senate, which given how tilted the field is this cycle against Democrats, will make them approximately as happy as this fellow if they pull it off. In the last month, Democrats have won two more Plinko chips, as races in Kansas and South Dakota have come into play. But then again, each chip is still only a long-shot try in a maddening game of twists, switchbacks, and disappointments. Republicans have a more familiar metaphor for the Democrats' strategy: throwing spaghetti at the wall. ""You throw a million bucks and you pray that something sticks,"" says a Republican strategist describing the recent investment by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in South Dakota. That race was already considered gone, one of the three locked up on the GOP march to the six seats Republicans need to pick up in order to take control of the Senate. ""This is a sign of weakness and not strength."" Though the metaphors mean virtually the same thing, the two views are a window into the positioning, strategy, and psychological warfare of the final frantic home stretch in the battle to control the Senate. Since the start of the cycle, operatives from both sides have been playing a variety of mind games, but now we're in a period when the efforts are more concentrated. The contours of the battlefield are well-known, the turnout efforts are already well-underway, and so strategists are both more at liberty and also more desperate as the clock winds down to dupe the other side into making bad bets that they think could matter in tight contests. ""It's a head fake,"" says one GOP strategist of the DSCC's last-minute million-dollar investment in South Dakota. The idea behind such a strategy is that the Democrats are making it look like they are trying, in order to get Republicans to pull resources away from the races where Democrats have a better shot of pulling off an upset. An alternative explanation is that since both parties are still raising money to fund every last ounce of effort, the razzle-dazzle activity offers a nice sales pitch for those last-minute donations. (There's new activity, so send us new cash!) The Democrats have either found an escape hatch or, seeing states like Arkansas, Alaska, Colorado, and Iowa fall away, are cooking up any last-minute gambit they can to do something (anything) to find a way to hold on to control. In the late-breaking chess game, both parties are in touch with their contacts in advertising, trying to uncover clues about what their counterparts are really up to. Republicans say Democrats have purchased only a quarter of their promised ad buy in South Dakota. Democrats reported late last week that they'd heard their counterparts had inquired about buying television time in the state. Sure enough, late last week Republicans announced they were going to respond in South Dakota with their own million-dollar advertising investment. (If it was a head fake, they went for it). Democrats have outraised Republicans by $27 million this cycle, so whether opening up a new battleground in South Dakota is a ruse or a long-shot luxury may be a distinction without a difference. The move has put pressure on the GOP. You wouldn't expect that this late in a competition where the environment is so favorable for Republicans. ""They've been pushing us around the last few weeks,"" admits a Republican strategist, referring to the late-breaking scuffling over Kansas and South Dakota seats long considered safe for the GOP. In an effort to fire back late Friday, the National Republican Senatorial Committee's independent expenditure arm announced a $7.4 million buy in competitive states. The two sides are not only engaging in psychological warfare with each other, but checking their own mental stability as new information comes in. When you spend so much time looking for signs of positive momentum, you have to be on the lookout for fool's gold. As Election Day nears, some noncompetitive races may look like they are tightening, but that's likely to be just party regulars coming home. The key is knowing what's a change in the fundamentals of the race and what's a blip of good news. At this stage in the race, states are usually falling away from the final set of truly contested battles. Recently the GOP has had to wave goodbye to Michigan, which was always a long shot. Republicans haven't given up in New Hampshire, though, where GOP challenger Scott Brown has consistently been trailing Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. On Monday morning Democrats were trying to argue that North Carolina was the next state Republicans would abandon (in part because it was left out of the Friday announcement of new spending), but before lunchtime, Politico's James Hohmann reported that the National Republican Senatorial Committee was backing a new $6 million ad campaign in what is likely to be the most expensive competition in the Senate cycle. One fun thing to watch for: What outside group will get caught putting money into a race that's long gone and have to answer to angry donors when the race is over? Strategists from both parties rarely admit that states are no longer competitive, but the closer you get to the end, the more participants must weigh their spin against their future reputations in the business. You don't want to be like the Romney campaign aides who ordered fireworks for election night. So you start to hear a change in the way they talk about races slipping away. They start to praise the candidates' hard work and underlying talent, as if to fashion a pre-loss consolation prize. All of this last-minute movement may be frantic busywork that does nothing to change the eventual outcomes. The bigger factors are likely to be the long-term investments the parties made in their turnout operations, the candidates they selected, and national weather patterns like ongoing unhappiness with the president and how that affects voter enthusiasm. In the meantime, no one involved in these races wants to leave any gambit unanswered or any strategy untried. After all, it's only by throwing spaghetti against the wall that you learn if you're truly cooked."	How Republican and Democratic Strategists Try to Get the Other Side to Make Costly Mistakes

The Supreme Court has yet to definitively rule that it is unconstitutional for state governments to refuse to recognize the marriages of same-sex couples, yet its decision to allow various lower-court rulings to stand is a big deal. It is no longer so difficult to imagine that in the next few years, the Supreme Court will find that there is a constitutional right to same-sex civil marriage that applies as much in Alabama as it does in Massachusetts. The stunning collapse of mainstream opposition to same-sex marriage represents the end of what has proved to be a short chapter of the culture war--after all, we're only 11 years from the Goodridge decision that allowed same-sex civil marriage in Massachusetts. So what will self-styled progressives and self-styled traditionalists battle over next? Even if same-sex marriage becomes the law of the land, we're not about to stop debating it. Gary Bauer, the former Republican presidential candidate, points in a recent Washington Examiner op-ed to the fact that at least one survey, from the Pew Research Center, finds that support for same-sex marriage may have peaked, having fallen 5 percentage points since February to 49 percent. This could be a blip, or it could be the start of a backlash. Moreover, it remains unclear if the success of the marriage equality movement will have some larger effect on how Americans think about marriage. David Blankenhorn of the Institute for American Values famously reversed his opposition to same-sex marriage on the grounds that we should be encouraging everyone to enter into long-term, sustainable relationships. Instead of devoting time and effort to keeping same-sex couples out of the institution, he wanted to rally them to the cause of reviving marriage for all Americans, particularly the poor and working-class Americans who are far less likely to be in stable marriages than their affluent and educated counterparts. Some conservative critics, like Ryan Anderson of the Heritage Foundation, argue that the rise of same-sex marriage represents the triumph of the misguided belief that consenting adults should be free to form any kind of relationship they choose. Anderson and his allies instead defend what they call the ""conjugal view"" of marriage, in which marriage is understood as permanent, exclusive, and rooted in the ways women and men are distinct and complementary. If marriage is redefined as an emotional union first and foremost, Anderson warns, there is no principled basis on which to oppose future redefinitions of the institution. Last year in Slate, for example, Jillian Keenan made the case for legalizing polyamory. You could also imagine the rise of advocates for temporary marriage, or other variations on the institution. There could be some cleavage, then, in the big tent of same-sex marriage supporters, with some joining Blankenhorn in making the case for monogamous marriage and others calling for moving beyond its strictures. A closely related possibility, widely feared among social conservatives, is that the winning side in the same-sex marriage debate won't prove magnanimous in victory. As the number of religiously unaffiliated Americans continues to grow, a new, more explicitly anti-religious strain of progressivism will emerge. America has never had an anti-clerical politics as such, as the United States has never had an established church of the kind found in Europe. Even as religious observance has declined, the American consensus in favor of the accommodation of religious belief has for the most part endured. Now, however, there are indications that appeals to religious liberty are losing their resonance for secular liberals. Many on the left see conscience exemptions from the contraception mandate for religiously affiliated employers as an outrageous infringement on sexual freedom. Catholic adoption agencies that refuse to work with same-sex couples are under pressure, as are higher education institutions like Gordon College that forbid ""homosexual practice."" If momentum continues to build for legislation, like the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, to forbid employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, many religious employers will seek carve-outs. There is no guarantee that they'll get them, particularly if those who back the legislation come to see exemption-seekers as unrepentant bigots. The next culture war could pit devout secularists against a shrinking religious minority determined to live in accordance with their beliefs. Even as public opinion swings on same-sex marriage, it doesn't appear to have shifted much on abortion. There are many theories as to why this is the case, the most intriguing of which was recently advanced by Northwestern University sociologists J. Alex Kevern and Jeremy Freese. Their basic idea is that because pro-life individuals tend to have more children than pro-choice individuals, and because abortion attitudes are to at least some degree informed by the attitudes of one's parents, younger Americans are more pro-life than you'd expect given the leftward drift of their views on a wide range of other social issues. It is also true, however, that as the prospects for overturning Roe v. Wade outright have dimmed, the abortion debate has shifted. In the 1990s, pro-life Republicans focused their attention on partial-birth abortion bans, an approach that proved fairly popular. More recently, pro-choice Democrats have sought to highlight the opposition of some pro-life conservatives to abortion in cases of rape, a profoundly unpopular position. Ramesh Ponnuru, author of The Party of Death, has called on Republicans to instead campaign for banning abortions after 20 weeks, an idea with much wider support. At the state level, pro-life groups like Americans United for Life have taken a more incremental approach. In particular, they've been demanding that abortion providers have admitting privileges at local hospitals and that their clinics adhere to hospital building codes. The case for these measures rests on the health and safety of women seeking abortions, yet they also dramatically raise the costs of operating the standalone abortion clinics that have long provided the vast majority of non-emergency abortions in the United States. Among pro-lifers, this strategy of pushing back against standalone clinics has been controversial, as some believe that moving abortions into hospitals will entrench the practice, while others think it will tend to reduce the number of elective abortions. Pro-choice advocates, meanwhile, find themselves charged with making a new economic model for abortion providers' work. These battles are subtler and more complicated than the abortion fights of the past, which relied more heavily on straightforward moralistic language, and they are likely to create new battle lines. Rand Paul, the libertarian Republican senator from Kentucky, has angered some on the pro-life right by insisting that the emergency contraceptive Plan B does not cause embryos to die. What does and does not count as a medical abortion matters a great deal to committed pro-lifers, and conservatives are finding themselves on different sides of the issue. Then there is the divide between anti-abortion activists who see long-acting reversible contraception as a valuable tool for reducing abortions, particularly for younger women, and those who see it as an enabler of irresponsible sexual behavior. Going even further into the future, we can expect new reproductive technologies to create new cultural divides. Will artificial wombs bring us to the promised land of gender equality, or will they alienate us from our offspring? Will the genomics revolution allow parents to build better babies? Our children and grandchildren, designer or otherwise, will be duking it out over precisely these questions. Of course, it's not necessarily true that the next culture war will center on marriage, sex, and abortion. We might instead see a fight that's rooted in the fusion of culture and class as a rising Latino population, much of it consisting of lower-income families, claims a larger share of political power. This year, Latinos are surpassing whites as the largest ethnic group in California, and the same thing is likely to happen in Texas in a few years' time. As demographer William Frey has observed, the mere fact of a large Latino population hasn't always translated into substantial Latino political power, as members of fast-growing minority populations are often either too young to vote or have yet to attain citizenship. Over time, however, Latinos will represent a larger share of the electorate, and other groups will have to adapt to diminished influence. And given that the Latino population is poorer than the population at large, we can expect that its members will press for a larger share of public resources at a time when the white and black populations will be aging rapidly. It is not at all obvious that non-Latinos will embrace this prospect. A team of psychologists at UCLA recently conducted a study in which white Americans drawn from across the country were divided into two groups. In one, they were told that whites would lose their majority status by 2050. In the other, they were told that whites would retain their majority status for some years beyond 2050. Not surprisingly, perhaps, the group that was told that white majority status was about to become a thing of the past was less inclined to support diversity. One wonders what would have happened had the researchers also surveyed black Californians, a group that has been surpassed in numbers by Latinos and Asians, and which has reason to fear political marginalization. It could be that as white and black Americans find their power waning, they will gain a new appreciation of all that they have in common. The next culture war will look very different from the old one. But whether it is about religious liberty or marriage and the family or who gets to define American identity, we can be sure of one thing: It will be fiercely fought."	The Battle Over Same-Sex Marriage Is Ending. What's the Next Big Culture War?
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/democratic_candidates_are_avoiding_obama_at_all_cost_democrats_invoke_republican.html	"Six years into Barack Obama's presidency, voters are sick of him. Most of them disapprove of his job performance. In state after state, Republicans are tying him around the necks of their Democratic opponents. What's a poor Democrat to do? The answer, it seems, is to attach yourself to a different president. If possible, a Republican. Or find another conservative icon to embrace: the last GOP presidential nominee, or the one before that, or some Republican colleague you barely know but once worked with on a fish inspection bill. Here's a look at the options, as demonstrated in recent candidate debates. 1. Ronald Reagan. He's dead, and his presidency ended a quarter-century ago, so all that's left are warm fuzzies and a place on Mt. Rushmore. Republicans talk about him in the same breath as Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt. But Democrats are getting in on the love. Colorado's Sen. Mark Udall used the Gipper to chastise his Republican challenger: ""As Ronald Reagan famously put it, facts are stubborn things."" Jack Hatch, the Democratic nominee for governor of Iowa, quoted Reagan in a debate with Republican incumbent Terry Branstad: ""You stop lying about me, and I'll stop telling the truth about you."" In retrospect, Reagan was a policy genius (he ""built the right framework to secure the border"") and a model of bipartisanship. ""I always admired Ronald Reagan,"" says Brad Ashford, the Democratic nominee for Congress in Nebraska's Second District. ""My hope is [to] go back to those days when Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan made things happen."" 2. George H.W. Bush. He was only a one-termer, and he didn't bring down communism, but in a pinch, he'll do. Michelle Nunn, the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in Georgia, has a personal connection to him--she was CEO of his Points of Light Foundation--and she's milking it for all it's worth. In a debate last month, she used it to shoot down TV ads that showed her standing next to Obama. The picture, she noted, ""was taken at President George H. W. Bush's library. And if you widen the lens, President George H. W. Bush is there. So I have the experience of working together across the aisle."" 3. George W. Bush. Democrats used to pound him without mercy. Now they're giving him mouth-to-mouth. When Udall was pressed this week about how often he has sided with Obama, the senator bragged about supporting Bush in Afghanistan and even praised the former president for raising the minimum wage. Those tax cuts for the rich? Never mind. But most of the love in this year's campaign is for Bush's immigration policy. Wendy Davis, the Democratic nominee for governor of Texas, says her approach to immigration ""is modeled after President George Bush's plan."" California Gov. Jerry Brown lauds Bush for giving undocumented immigrants access to a fair hearing. In the revisionist account of Bush's presidency, he was a compassionate pragmatist ""torpedoed"" by right-wingers. 4. The whole Bush family. Take your pick. Mike Ross, the Democratic nominee for governor of Arkansas, says the Common Core education standards must be fine, since Jeb Bush helped draft them. In Georgia, Nunn responded to a nasty Republican campaign ad--which accused her of funneling money to ""organizations linked to terrorists""--by quoting Neil Bush, brother of Jeb and George W. In a statement, Neil called the ad ""shameful."" Nunn used the rebuke to depict her opponent as a political bomb-thrower who disrespects America's most beloved family. 5. Mitt Romney. To defuse public anger over Obamacare, Democrats are taking the Obama out of it. They call it the Affordable Care Act and point out that Romney had the idea first. In a debate this week, Sen. Mark Warner traced its lineage back to Republican politicians who supported an individual mandate 20 years ago. And remember when Democrats savaged Romney for writing off 47 percent of the electorate? That's so two years ago. North Carolina's Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan now touts him as a man of the people: ""Mitt Romney thinks we should increase the minimum wage."" 6. John McCain. In 2008, Democrats latched onto Obama to escape McCain. Now they're latching onto McCain to escape Obama. When Republicans accuse them of supporting amnesty or failing to seal the border, Democrats say these charges can't be true, because McCain shares the same positions. Warner dared his challenger to suggest ""that Lindsey Graham and John McCain are not tough enough on the border."" Bruce Braley, the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in Iowa, lectured his opponent: ""Sen. Rubio and Sen. McCain did not vote for amnesty."" Ron Barber, the Democratic nominee in Arizona's second congressional district, suggested that comparing McCain to Obama was an insult to McCain: ""My opponent ... has called the McCain-Flake bill the Obamacare of immigration. That is mocking our two senior senators!"" When you mock both senior senators, that's really low. 7. Scott Brown. Four years ago, when Brown replaced the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, he was the man Republicans counted on to sink Obamacare. Now the best way to stop Obamacare from sinking your campaign is to make Brown your flotation device. Greg Orman, the independent candidate for U.S. Senate in Kansas, is using Brown to answer complaints about money Orman has given to Democrats. ""I actually gave money to Scott Brown in Massachusetts in 2010, precisely because he was the vote that was supposed to prevent the Affordable Care Act from becoming law,"" Orman asserted yesterday. 8. Any Republican you ever worked with. For Alaska's Sen. Mark Begich, the list of buddies includes Republican Sens. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Orrin Hatch of Utah, Dean Heller of Nevada, Marco Rubio of Florida, and John Thune of South Dakota. For Minnesota's Sen. Al Franken, it extends to Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, Dick Lugar of Indiana, Rob Portman of Ohio, David Vitter of Louisiana, Roger Wicker of Mississippi, and even Pat Roberts of Kansas, who's running the angriest, most partisan campaign in the country. ""I've worked with so many of my Republican colleagues,"" says Franken. 9. Bill Clinton. If all else fails, hitch yourself to a Democrat. But don't let it be Obama, and make the context as far from Obama as possible. That's how Fred DuVal, the Democratic nominee for governor of Arizona, presented his resume in a debate last month. DuVal talked about ""working in the Clinton White House to implement welfare reform"" and collecting ""over 200 Republican endorsements"" for governor. Obama? Never heard of him. We are all McCainsians now."	Democrats Prefer Invoking Republicans Rather Than Their Own President: a List of  Their Favorites
20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/the_supreme_court_s_next_attack_on_civil_rights_the_justices_will_likely.html	"Last Thursday the Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments in the case of Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. The Inclusive Communities Project. The case concerns the ""disparate impact"" rule, a legal guideline embedded in the 1968 Fair Housing Act that says discrimination doesn't have to be intentional to be discrimination. This rule has been at the bedrock of fair-housing enforcement for more than four decades. Another way to understand disparate impact is this: It's a way to confront the realities of racial inequality without trying to prove the motivations of an institution, organization, or landlord. In housing especially, it's rare to get someone as explicit about his discrimination as Donald Sterling. More often, you must look for patterns of unequal results or unfair treatment that stem from ""objective"" or ""neutral"" criteria. In United States v. Wells Fargo, for example, the Department of Justice sued the mortgage lender over its role in the subprime market. According to the suit, Wells Fargo brokers raised interest rates and fees for more than 30,000 minority customers, and encouraged black and Hispanic homeowners to take subprime loans even if they qualified for traditional financing. We don't know if malice drove this policy, but under disparate impact guidelines, it doesn't matter: The government can show concrete harm and act accordingly. This is an expansive power, but given our history, also a necessary one. We built our housing markets on a structure of discrimination, from bias in lending and state-sanctioned segregation to exclusionary zoning and active attacks on minority homeownership. To fix this, you can't just ban discrimination, you need a countervailing force; otherwise, inequality would reproduce itself. Beyond this, there's the simple fact that racial bias is still alive in vast areas of American life, and it's a fool's errand to root out racists--most people who discriminate are too smart to broadcast their prejudice. Disparate impact--backed by both courts and the present administration--is a vital tool in fighting these battles. But it's also controversial, with opponents who see it as subversive to equal protection. ""Instead of promoting equal protection under the law,"" wrote Ammon Simon for National Review in 2012, disparate impact ""grasps at 'ensuring equal results,' treating people like depersonalized 'components of a racial, religious, sexual or national class.' "" Likewise, in his concurrence in Ricci v. DeStefano--an affirmative action case--Justice Antonin Scalia swings at the doctrine, calling disparate impact provisions in employment practices a ""racial thumb on the scales"" that forces discriminatory ""racial decisionmaking."" Scalia and the conservative bloc of the Supreme Court are hostile to almost all race-conscious policies--from affirmative action (which Justice Clarence Thomas once compared to segregation) to important parts of the Voting Rights Act--and want to end disparate impact as a federal tool. Last year they almost had a chance; a group of New Jersey residents challenged disparate impact in Mount Holly v. Mount Holly Gardens Citizens in Action, Inc., a fight over a neighborhood revitalization plan that plaintiffs claimed would dislocate and disproportionately harm minority residents. But the case was settled before it could reach the high court. With the latest case, a settlement is unlikely. The court will hear disparate impact, and most likely--following Chief Justice John Roberts' infamous declaration that ""the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race""--end it. It's hard to overstate the magnitude of such a decision. In the last decade, with Roberts at the forefront, the Supreme Court has chipped away at the major provisions and policies of the civil rights era. With Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 in 2007, the Roberts court struck down voluntary integration efforts in Seattle; with Shelby County v. Holder, it struck down the preclearance formula for the Voting Rights Act, gutting the law and opening the door to voter suppression; and with Schuette v. BAMN, it gave Michigan voters free rein to block affirmative action through constitutional amendment. At the moment, it's poised to uphold strict voter identification laws and--if the opportunity presents itself--strike at the core provisions of the VRA. There's a reason Justice Sonia Sotomayor swiped at Roberts in her now-famous Schuette dissent--the chief justice has launched an astounding assault on civil rights law that promises huge consequences for efforts against racial inequality. And indeed, Roberts is joined by a whole host of right-wing legislators and conservative intellectuals--perched at think tanks like the Heritage Foundation and the misnamed Center for Equal Opportunity--all united in a ""colorblind"" vision of American life that doesn't see a public role for fighting racial inequality, and often holds it as overstated or attributable to ""culture,"" not the accumulated effects of past discrimination. What's interesting is the degree to which this isn't new. In fact, it sits parallel to our past, where large gains for minorities--and blacks in particular--sit flush with setbacks and challenges. We don't think of it this way in the popular imagination, but the United States had two periods of ""Reconstruction."" The first came after emancipation, when freed slaves worked in alliance with sympathetic whites to rebuild the South and forge a new path after the Civil War. But weakened by President Andrew Johnson, it never came to fruition. Instead, it was destroyed by ex-Confederates who terrorized the South with violence and drove blacks out of political life. With the Democratic Party as their vehicle, these ""Redeemers"" would set the stage for Jim Crow, convict leasing, and the march of horrors that marked black life for the next century. The Second Reconstruction was the civil rights movement, and--as historian Eric Foner writes in his magisterial book on the first Reconstruction, it marks a time when ""the nation again attempted to come to terms with the implications of emancipation and the political and social agenda of Reconstruction."" Where the first Reconstruction had politicians, the second had preachers (and later, again, politicians). And where the first gave us a new Constitution--through the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments--the second gave force to their provisions, through the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. It's these laws--and the court cases that followed--that dismantled Jim Crow and integrated blacks into American political life. Outside the far, far fringes of American life, there's no challenge to that inclusion. But as we see with large parts of the Republican Party--including today's conservatives on the Supreme Court--there is a challenge to the race-conscious policies and measures we use to protect and secure the political participation of blacks and other minorities. This attack has far more to do with partisan advantage than any racial animus--as Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott explained in his defense of the state's voter ID law, the goal is to limit Democrats, not minorities. Still, the effect is the same: applying new state limits on participation that have their largest impact on minorities, with shrinking protection from the federal government. In his 1883 ruling against the 1875 Civil Rights Act--which prohibited black exclusion from jury service and guaranteed equal treatment in public accommodations, public transportation--Justice Joseph P. Bradley took a stand that should sound familiar to contemporary opponents of so-called racial entitlements:"	The Roberts Court's Next Attack on Civil Rights
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/marijuana_legalization_what_the_next_wave_of_pot_legalizing_states_can_learn.html	There's a weed shortage in Washington. Three months after regulators in the state gave the go-ahead for retail marijuana stores to open their doors in July, licensed storefronts remain few and far between. And in the relatively few shops that do exist, there's a noticeable lack of product. The state's slow, weed-deprived start stands in stark contrast to the scene in Colorado, where regulators have largely delivered on their promise to quickly create a robust retail market. Just how big is the gap between Colorado's bounty and Washington's scarcity? As of late last month, according to the Seattle Times, Washington officials had handed out 57 licenses to retail weed stores, many of which still haven't opened due to a mix of supply and zoning problems. In Colorado, meanwhile, at least 40 retail shops began selling pot on Jan. 1, the first day sales became legal. Today, more than 240 recreational shops are in operation, a number that is set to grow to nearly 300 after Colorado handed out 46 new licenses to retail stores last week. The contrast is even bigger in each state's largest city. Supply is so hard to come by for Seattle's two retail stores that the owners have had to get creative. Cannabis City has resorted to flying a flag outside on those occasions it does have bud for sale. The second, Uncle Ike's, opened last week with limits on how much a customer could buy in hopes that it could stretch its initial stock into a second week. Customers in Denver, meanwhile, can pick and choose from among roughly 200 commercial outlets, few of which are in any danger of running out of pot. Unsurprisingly, that difference in supply and access shows up in the revenue column: Colorado's retail stores sold roughly $14 million worth of legal weed during their first month in business, while Washington's sold only $3.8 million. Why do the two states that cast historic votes to legalize recreational pot on the same day in 2012 find themselves in such different places nearly two years later? While it may seem like Colorado is a runaway success story and Washington a cautionary tale, the cavernous divide between the states' weed rollouts has much more to do with design and necessity than it does with the competence of each state's government. Rocky Mountain retailers are prevalent and well-stocked largely because of Colorado's history with legalized marijuana. The state required its first shops to have operated within its existing regulated medical marijuana market, ensuring that Colorado would be dealing with established players. Regulators also decided to allow new stores to convert portions of their existing medical stockpile to commercial weed (allowing shelves to be stocked on Day 1), and they require all retail shops to grow at least half the weed they sell (helping them stay that way on Day 100). Why, then, wouldn't Washington make the same decisions? The short answer is that it couldn't. The medical marijuana dispensaries that are scattered around the state are largely tolerated but technically illegal. Washington allows for individuals and caregivers to grow their own pot for medicinal purposes, but not to sell it commercially. So while Colorado was able to layer a new retail market on top of its already regulated medical one, Washington was forced to start from scratch. Between inexperienced regulators and unestablished entrepreneurs, it's hardly a surprise that bureaucrats have been slow to issue licenses and stores have struggled to open. The state and the sellers weren't the only ones without a head start. Washington's marijuana farmers were likewise barred from growing retail weed until they had licenses in hand--a decision that was a legal necessity but one that effectively guaranteed the state's stores would be scrounging for supply until the first outdoor crops mature later this year. Regulators, no doubt realizing speed was not going to be their state's calling card, also put a higher premium on safety, requiring quality testing from the outset. Colorado, meanwhile, opted to wait several months before phasing in similar mandatory potency testing, allowing the market to get off to a running start but leading to some problems along the way. Washington's slow and steady march could still pay dividends when it comes to the business of weed. While Colorado allows for--and in part requires--vertical integration between growers, processors, and sellers, Washington forbids it. That's been an early burden for shops that need to spend their time searching for pot to sell, but regulators maintain that it will prevent the market from eventually being dominated by big businesses. As an added bonus for the state, it also provides three distinct points to impose a tax: between grower and processor, processor and store, and store and consumer. And while the lack of medical marijuana regulations has caused Washington a string of headaches in the early days of retail pot, officials are optimistic that an eventual crackdown on the semi-illegal medical market will push many consumers into retail stores, where the pot is both taxed (good for the state) and tested for safety (good for the consumer). In Colorado, meanwhile, medical marijuana--cheaper than retail weed, and still legal--will remain relatively easy to buy for any resident who takes the trouble to secure a state-issued red card. So closing the gap between the medical and retail markets there will likely take longer and prove more difficult. Of course, given that the market is already regulated, harmonizing the two is also less urgent. All of that is to say that it's too early to predict whether Colorado and Washington's bold pot experiment will work as intended and that it's a mistake to judge either based on the speed at which each hits subjective checkpoints along the way. But with Oregon, Alaska, and the District of Columbia potentially joining the nascent legalization movement this November--and with a half-dozen other states considering similar ballot initiatives in 2016--it stands to reason that future regulators won't have the luxury of waiting until all the evidence is in before deciding how to set up their systems. Nonetheless, the early returns suggest the regulations and structures they already have in place will be just as important as what they implement in the future. In that regard, states like Alaska--where medical pot is legal to use but technically illegal to buy--may have little choice but to follow Washington's slow and steady lead. Those with a regulated medical market like Oregon's, meanwhile, will have more freedom to try to match Colorado's faster pace. The outstanding question is whether those two paths will lead to the same long-term result.	Why Don't Washington State's Retail Marijuana Stores Have Any Pot for Sale?
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/junior_smith_and_juvenile_incarceration_in_west_virginia.html	"The piece was reported and written by Dana Goldstein for The Marshall Project, a new nonprofit news organization focused on the criminal justice system. Sign up for updates on their launch. On Feb. 27, 2013, 17-year-old Junior Smith was summoned to the front office of his Philippi, West Virginia, high school. It was eighth period, just a few minutes before everyone would start streaming out of the building for dismissal. When Junior got to the office, a police officer was there, waiting for him. The officer handcuffed Junior and led him past his staring classmates to a waiting patrol car. The officer then drove Junior to the Lorrie Yeager Jr. Juvenile Center, a maximum-security facility 100 miles away. Junior was charged with misdemeanor battery and violation of a prior court order. A week earlier, Junior had gotten into a fight with another boy in their agricultural structures class. In Junior's retelling, it had been horseplay; a group of guys taking turns trapping one another in a tool closet. When one boy emerged from the closet, Junior reported that he extended his hand to him in a conciliatory handshake but that the boy bent his thumb back painfully. Junior then swatted at the boy's groin with an open-faced palm. The other boy told a different story: that he had been the only student forced into the closet that day and that when he broke out, Junior--who the boy claimed had picked on him in the past--hit him twice, unprovoked, once with a shovel and once with his hand. Both boys agreed there had been no crying, no screaming, and no lasting pain. When the bell rang, they both filed out of the room. The scuffle hadn't attracted the attention of the teacher, and Junior didn't think much about it afterward. What he and his parents did not know was that the other boy had reported the incident to Chad Kennedy, a county police officer who worked full time at Philip Barbour High School and who was paid, in part, by a federal ""juvenile accountability"" grant intended to assure ""individualized consequences"" for juvenile offenders, including community service and mediation. But those were not the consequences for Junior. After the classroom fight, Kennedy launched an investigation of the conflict. He prepared a report for a judge, who on Feb. 27 signed an order for Junior's arrest. That afternoon, Junior walked out of school in handcuffs. The scuffle in school was not Junior's first. He had a history of troubling behavior: popping painkillers, fighting, skipping class. But Junior's mother, Kathy, a nurse, considered him a handful, not a menace, and she was stunned that he had been abruptly pulled from school and locked up. After seven days at Yeager, Junior was transported three hours away from his home, to the Donald R. Kuhn Juvenile Center, another maximum-security facility for kids as young as 10. During his three-month wait for a court date, he filled out a psychological evaluation:"	Why Is West Virginia Locking Up So Many Minors?
23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/10/sam_brownback_s_ruinous_economic_policies_the_kansas_governor_s_experiments.html	"Somehow, in a year with tight, interesting races in places like Arkansas and North Carolina, the Kansas statewide contests have become the most exciting contests in the country. In the Kansas gubernatorial race, Republican Gov. Sam Brownback is losing his re-election bid to Democrat Paul Davis--the HuffPost Pollster average puts Davis ahead by 3.6 points--while GOP Sen. Pat Roberts is losing his race to Greg Orman, a multimillionaire independent whose chief appeal is that he isn't Roberts. Kansas isn't a liberal place--it went 57 percent for John McCain in 2008 and 60 percent for Mitt Romney in 2012--and has a large Republican registration advantage. But barring shifts in either race, Kansas voters are prepared to dump their Republican incumbents for two challengers. And if there's a single person to blame, it's Brownback. In 2010, after two and a half terms in the Senate, Brownback made a bid for the governor's mansion. Riding the Tea Party wave, he swept his opponent in a landslide, promising a new age for Kansas politics. ""[We] put forward a roadmap for Kansas,"" he said in his victory speech. ""It's a plan to grow our economy, it's a plan to create private-sector jobs, it's a plan to excel in education, it's a plan to support our families, it's a plan to move forward. We campaigned on the roadmap, we won on the roadmap, we will govern on the roadmap."" Brownback didn't just keep his promise, he embarked on a radical ""real live experiment"" in conservative governance. As he later explained to the Wall Street Journal, ""My focus is to create a red-state model that allows the Republican ticket to say, 'See, we've got a different way, and it works.' "" With advice from Arthur Laffer--the long-discredited guru for supply-side economics--and support from a new band of conservative lawmakers in the Kansas statehouse, the newly minted governor pursued a path of rigid orthodoxy. His signature move was a massive tax cut: He eliminated the top income bracket of 6.45 percent, reduced the middle bracket from 6.25 percent to 4.9 percent, reduced the lowest bracket from 3.5 percent to 3 percent, and ended taxes on certain kinds of small-business income. This, he promised, would increase disposable income and create thousands of jobs. In reality, however, Kansas' job growth stagnated in 2012 and income growth fell. Far from a stimulus plan, Brownback's tax cuts were a massive program of redistribution for the rich. According to a report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, the bottom 20 percent of Kansas taxpayers saw their tax burden increase by more than half a percent as a result of the Brownback plan, while the wealthiest Kansans saw their taxes decrease by 1 percent. Indeed, these tax cuts were followed by harsh new welfare requirements (including drug tests and stricter work provisions), and tighter eligibility for food stamps. He rejected new federal funding for Medicaid (and privatized its functions, prompting an FBI investigation), slashed thousands of state jobs, and made large cuts to education funding. Conservative lawmakers cheered these moves, but more moderate Republicans--who held a strong presence in the state Senate--criticized the most extreme parts of the governor's agenda. They worried tax cuts would drain state coffers, and opposed large cuts to education and social services. ""I have consistently advocated for budget cuts over the last three years, but my Republican conservative colleagues can't get enough,"" said one moderate senator, who, according to the New York Times, retired rather than fight his right-wing colleagues. Rather than work with dissenters or moderate his program, Brownback went on the offensive, aiding a wave of conservative challengers in the 2012 state primaries. Koch-backed groups like Americans for Prosperity and the Kansas Chamber of Commerce pumped hundreds of thousands of dollars into races around the state, defeating moderates and building a conservative supermajority in the state legislature. With his power secured, Brownback turned up the heat. In 2013 he proposed another round of tax cuts that would eliminate income taxes and maintain a high sales tax. Critics blasted the plan, noting the extent to which it was a massive tax increase on the poorest Kansans: For instance, replacing 50 percent of income tax losses with a sales tax would raise taxes on the lowest earners by 2.5 percent. But Brownback promised new revenue ($777 million in state earnings) and broad prosperity. ""We're on a path of growth and job creation, so I say, 'Come to Kansas,' "" he said. ""We're paving the way to make Kansas the best place in America to raise a family and run a business."" A year later Kansas is among the most dysfunctional states in the country. Even after cuts in schools, colleges, libraries, and social services, Kansas can't keep up with expenses. This year, it faced a huge shortfall in personal income tax receipts, and had to end tax rebates for food and child care to help fill the hole. And overall, it faces a $900 million budget shortfall by 2019, even as the top income tax rate is scheduled to decline to 3.9 percent by 2018. Both Moody's and S&P have downgraded the state's bond rating, and economic growth has been poor. Far from giving Kansas a bright new future, Brownback plunged it into chaos. The result for Republicans has been huge political blowback, as voters react against these ruinous policies. Paul Davis, for instance, has secured endorsements from more than 100 current and former Republican officials who oppose Brownback's administration. And Roberts--who has his own problems with Kansas voters--has likely been harmed by this anger. Frustration with Brownback, in other words, has grown into frustration with the entire Republican ticket. Neither man is out of the fight--there's still enough time for the tide to turn against Davis and Orman. But it's hard to see how. Davis continues to hold his lead, and--with the Democratic candidate officially off the ballot in the Senate race--Orman has built his. On both ends, the implications for national politics are huge. If Brownback loses, he may discredit the ""red-state way"" for future Republican governors. And if Orman wins, well, there's a decent chance we'll have a Democratic Senate for the next two years. In other words, while the Brownback experiment began as a move to vindicate conservative Republicans, come November, it might ruin them."	Will Gov. Sam Brownback's Crazy Kansas Experiments Haunt the Republican Party?

""There is no such thing as 'talking white,' ... it's actually called 'speaking fluently,' speaking your language correctly. I don't know why we've gotten to a place where as a culture--as a race--if you sound as though you have more than a fifth-grade education, it's a bad thing."" She continues like this for nearly two more minutes, emphasizing the point that her speech reflects proper English and attacking the idea that it's a deviation from black identity. If she was hoping for a positive response, she got it. In addition to thousands of shares and tweets, it reached more than 560,000 views and made the front page of Reddit. Not that this was a surprise. The main ideas--that black Americans disparage ""proper English"" and education and use a ""broken"" version of the language--have wide currency among many Americans, including blacks. ""Ebonics"" is mocked as a fake language, and efforts to use it in schools have sparked vocal opposition. When the Oakland, California, school board approved Ebonics for use in its schools in 1996, a flurry of public figures condemned the decision. ""I understand the attempt to reach out to these children, but this is an unacceptable surrender, bordering on disgrace,"" said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who later reversed his stance, but not before he was endorsed by a wide range of people. At the time, linguists protested the criticism, noting the extent to which Ebonics--officially known as African American Vernacular English--is recognized as a language system with its own grammar and pronunciations, with roots in the regional dialects of 17th-century Great Britain. Far from being slang or broken, AAVE is a distinct form of English used by many blacks in informal settings. Still, it is true that so-called ""proper English""--otherwise known as Standard English--is associated with white people. And there are many anecdotes and stories of black teenagers disparaging one another for using Standard English or ""talking white,"" which also tends to come with accusations of ""acting white."" And, as we can see from the video, it's these accusations that stand as Exhibit A in arguments for the existence of black pathology. After relating a story involving his sister and her children, who asked him why he ""talk white,"" Wall Street Journal columnist Jason Riley mourns the alleged pathology of black anti-intellectualism that stunts community growth. ""Here were a couple of black third graders already linking speech patterns to race and intelligence,"" he writes in his book Please Stop Helping Us. ""They had determined that 'sounding white' was something to be mocked in other blacks and avoided in their own speech."" In this anecdote, Riley provides the nut of the ""acting white"" theory: That blacks stigmatize academic achievement and code it as ""white."" But as he notes in the book, the definitive treatment comes from the late John Ogbu, a professor of anthropology at the University of California-Berkeley. In multiple studies over several decades, Ogbu explored the allegedly ""oppositional"" culture of black teenagers and pushed the ""acting white"" idea into the popular discourse. ""The low school performance of black children stems from the following factors,"" he writes with Signithia Fordham in the 1986 paper, ""Black Students' School Success: Coping with the Burden of 'Acting White' "":"	"Why Black People's Disdain for ""Proper English"" Is a Myth"
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/republicans_attacking_democrats_on_obama_s_unpopular_foreign_policy_how.html	"Sens. Mark Udall, Jeanne Shaheen, and Kay Hagan all serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee. With national security in the headlines, that position could give them standing to speak with authority about terrorist threats and what they believe the United States should do to respond to them. But at the moment when the president's response to the threat from ISIS is being criticized, and approval of his handling of foreign affairs is low (at only 34 percent), being a member from the same party with responsibility for national security issues may be a liability. Republicans sure think so. In New Hampshire, Republican Senate challenger Scott Brown has been attacking Shaheen for months on a variety of national security issues. Mostly he has focused on securing the border, but in the last month he has talked more about ISIS. Last week he started running an ad that referred to the group. ""President Obama and Sen. Shaheen seem confused about the nature of the threat"" from radical Islamic terrorists, he says. This week, in North Carolina and Colorado, Republicans picked up the same line of attack. The president announced military action against the jihadist outfit several weeks ago, but the issue is taking off in the broader political discussion only now. Republicans have an overwhelming advantage over Democrats when people are asked which party they trust to handle national security issues. In the latest CBS poll, Republicans have a 20-point lead on this question and respondents have elevated national security issues to their second-most important concern. The danger for Republicans is that, despite their polling advantage on national security, the nation is not anxious to go to war. So while they may be ready to criticize the president, they don't have a clear policy prescription that is much different from his own. Former Vice President Dick Cheney's speech attacking President Obama three weeks ago contained several ideas for targeting the Islamist group. That same night Obama described a plan that essentially lined up with what Cheney had suggested. But with Republicans still criticizing the president's approach, it raises the natural question: What more would they like to do? That question leads to ground troops, an idea that almost no Republican (or anyone else) wants to raise, though GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin on Tuesday said ground troops were the only way to defeat ISIS. Republicans would rather talk about the past and make a seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee seem like a seat in the Situation Room. The most practical and pressing issue at the moment is how to combat this terrorist force. But there is also the important matter of whether those responsible for American national security are sufficiently vigilant. That's the part of the debate Republicans would like to have: Were the administration and its congressional allies asleep at the switch? That's a debate that doesn't immediately require Republicans to come up with a ready plan for what they would do while inflicting maximum blame on Democrats for letting the threat emerge. President Obama told CBS's 60 Minutes that he agreed with National Intelligence Director James Clapper's recent assessment that ""we underestimated the Islamic State."" Several officials in the intelligence agencies the president was including in that ""we"" do not happen to agree. I spoke to one former senior member of the intelligence community who says they had been watching and reporting on ISIS to the administration for a long time. Last June, on Face the Nation, former CIA acting director Mike Morell said that the intelligence agencies had been on the case and that the failure to confront the threat was not an ""intelligence failure."" A senior intelligence official repeated a version of the same thing to the New York Times on Tuesday. It's in their interest to shift blame right back to the White House, of course, but Republicans are happy to take advantage of the discord. The debate is now whether a threat could have been anticipated but was missed. North Carolina's Sen. Kay Hagan seemed to agree with that view in her last debate against Republican challenger Thom Tillis. She said that the president had made a mistake by not supporting the moderate forces in Syria. She subscribed to Hillary Clinton's perspective: Had Obama armed Syrian rebels early enough, ISIS would not have grown as it did. She isn't the only Democrat to affirm the asleep-at-the-switch theory. The problem for Hagan is that she can't easily separate herself from the president, and Republicans are now trying to put her on the hook for the same lapse. ""In January, President Obama refers to the Islamic State as a JV team,"" the narrator says in a new Thom Tillis ad. ""Days later, the Armed Services Committee holds a hearing on new global threats. Sen. Kay Hagan [was] absent. In fact, Hagan's missed half the Armed Services Committee hearings this year."" The ""price for their failure is danger."" Meanwhile, the National Republican Senatorial Committee is hitting Sen. Udall in Colorado for saying that ISIS ""does not present an imminent threat to this nation."" The ad asks: ""Really? Can we take that chance?"" Democrats have two other options. They can pivot from talking about the past and highlight that their opponents don't really disagree with the president's strategy. It might be good on the merits, but it bogs them down in a conversation about national security where voters are more likely to trust Republicans. The other option is to talk about anything else--preferably a domestic policy issue. That latter option appears to be the approach most Democrats are likely to take. Republican strategists say women voters are the primary audience for this new wave of national security ads. (As Peter Beinart wrote recently, women voters are the most politically sensitive to concerns about homeland security.) Given that Democrats are working so hard to turn out female voters, one Republican involved in several Senate campaigns says that talk of national security is aimed at moving support among women. ""The Republicans challenging these incumbents seem to be seizing on the issue as a possible way to seal the deal,"" says Elizabeth Wilner who tracks ads for Kantar Media Ad Intelligence, ""and a welcome chance to break from Democratic narratives that were bad for them: women's issues for [Cory] Gardner, education for Tillis, and 'what have you done for New Hampshire' for Scott Brown."" In a recent column for the Cook Political Report, Wilner points out how thoroughly Republicans rely on international affairs in the ad wars. Republicans in Senate races are responsible for 92 percent of the ads on the topic. It's like abortion for Democrats, who have run 96 percent of the ads on that issue. But it's not clear yet how broadly Republicans are going to level this attack. David Perdue, the Republican Senate candidate in Georgia, has made a clumsy attempt to use the issue against Michelle Nunn. Iowa, Alaska, and Arkansas--all states where Republican candidates have military or national security credentials--are likely places to see more talk of ISIS. So far though, of the top 12 issues touched on in this cycle's political ads, international affairs ranks last. Of course, it's only been on the front page for a few months and the issue is gaining steam. The question remains whether Democrats have the right strategy for combating the surge."	How Can Democrats Defend Themselves From the President's Foreign Policy Blunders?
26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/narendra_modi_at_madison_square_garden_why_19_000_people_cheered_for_the.html	"In Sir Vidia's Shadow, Paul Theroux recounts a moment in which his friend, the notorious misanthrope V.S. Naipaul, urges the Indian high commissioner in Nairobi to do more than just meekly protest Kenya's harsh treatment of its Indian minority. ""India is a big, powerful country,"" Naipaul tells the diplomat, yet the Kenyan government had been treating its nationals as though it were ""just another shabby little country."" The high commissioner insists that he has sent the Kenyan government a strongly worded letter, and Naipaul replies by calling on India to send a gunboat to shell Mombasa, Kenya's port city. ""When Mombasa is in flames they will think twice about persecuting Indians here. Aren't there fuel depots in Mombasa? Yes, they will leave the Indians alone for some little time."" Theroux was, of course, conveying that Naipaul could be a lunatic and a hothead--shelling Mombasa was a ludicrous idea. But this exchange tells us more than that. For one thing, it explains why Narendra Modi, India's newly minted prime minister, has emerged as one of the world's most popular and most polarizing political figures. Naipaul, a British writer born in Trinidad, is a descendant of Indian laborers who settled in the Caribbean in the 1890s. Like many members of the Indian diaspora, he has a love-hate relationship with India itself. During his first visit to India in the 1960s, Naipaul was appalled by the poverty, lassitude, and decay he found almost everywhere. Yet in later years he came to celebrate the nationalist self-assertion of India's Hindu right, which he saw as a potential source of the country's renewal. These were the kind of Indians who loved their country unreservedly, and Naipaul admired them for it. Modi strikes many observers as one of these Indians, too. And that, I'd submit, is why he attracted 19,000 cheering fans to a rally in Madison Square Garden on Sunday. Many of Modi's most loyal followers are indeed Indians and people of Indian origin living outside of India. This might strike you as contradictory: If these Modiphiles are such devoted Indian nationalists, why would they leave their native country to become cardiologists in Houston or financial engineers in Singapore? The reason is that until very recently, India has offered scant opportunities for its best and brightest. Many Indian emigres are of the view that the best thing they can do for their country is to make something of themselves abroad, and to then spread their wealth and influence back home. By promising to make India a country they can be proud of, and a place where bright young Indians can make their fortunes, Modi tells these reluctant exiles exactly what they want to hear. In the wider world, India is best known as the home of Gandhi, the patron saint of passive resistance, and Nehru, the socialist aristocrat who served as the country's first prime minister and who insisted that the world's most populous democracy remain nonaligned. Within India, however, there have always been those who've opposed Gandhian pacifism and Nehruvian socialism. India's humiliating military defeat at the hands of China in 1962 was an early indication to these dissenters that calling for peace and love wasn't the best way to win respect on the international stage. East Asia's rapid economic rise in the decades that followed, meanwhile, proved to them that India's embrace of Soviet-style central planning was a colossal mistake. India's pro-market nationalists have always been a small minority, particularly among the country's intellectuals. But their ranks have grown over the past two decades, for a number of reasons. First, India was forced to open its economy in 1991 in the wake of a balance of payments crisis. The reforms that followed sparked sustained economic growth that in turn led to rising expectations, particularly among members of India's growing urban middle class. But India's economic growth has come disproportionately in high-tech services, a sector that draws on a pitifully small and relatively privileged swath of India's population of 1.25 billion. The political coalition for economic reform thus wound up far smaller than it might have had its benefits spread more widely, as in the fast-growing East Asian economies. Nevertheless, this experience convinced at least some Indians that what the nation really needed was to deepen economic reform, not to abandon it. Second, the decline of Nehru's Congress Party coincided with the rise of dozens of communal and caste-based political parties that reflected India's diversity and its disputatiousness. This political fragmentation led at least some Indians to look to Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party as a unifying, truly national alternative to the badly discredited Congress Party. The BJP has traditionally been dominated by parochial Hindu chauvinists hailing from India's Hindi-speaking heartland. But under Modi, the party shows signs of becoming something quite different. Modi, hailing from Gujarat, one of India's more prosperous states and the native region of many of India's most successful emigres, represented a different, more modern strain of the party. Though often accused of Hindu chauvinism (and worse) himself, Modi was resented by the BJP's old guard, who saw him as an ambitious outsider who sought to displace them. They were right. As chief minister of Gujarat, the local equivalent of a state governor, Modi embraced cutting-edge campaign techniques, including social media, to make the case for a leaner, corruption-free government. His slogan was ""minimum government and maximum governance,"" a neat way of telling Indians that he wanted to make the country less oppressively bureaucratic while also making it richer and more orderly. Of course, not everyone buys into the Modi magic. The prime minister is widely loathed among Indian intellectuals. Pankaj Misra, the go-to Indian voice for highbrow periodicals in the English-speaking world, lambastes him as a ""dangerous cliche"" who panders to Indian insecurities. And then there are those who insist that Modi is a human rights violator and an anti-Muslim bigot. In 2002, shortly after he first came to office, Hindu-Muslim communal riots broke out across Gujarat. After 60 Hindus died in a burning train, hundreds of Muslims died in revenge killings. Some of Modi's harshest critics claim that Gujarat's local officials stood idly by as the killings took place and that Modi himself must be to blame. More galling to some is the fact that Modi has never expressed any contrition over the breakdown of law and order. In 2005, the State Department found that Modi's failure to stop the 2002 riots made him ineligible for a visa to travel to the United States. (That travel ban was lifted after Modi became prime minister.) So is Modi a Muslim-hating zealot? One thing we know for certain is that his rhetoric has grown more inclusive over time. Ashutosh Varshney, a Brown University political scientist and a leading expert on communal violence in urban India, observed earlier this year that in his campaign speeches, Modi had abandoned the more chauvinistic aspects of Hindu nationalist ideology, including anti-Muslim sentiment. He is a nationalist like Naipaul, but you'd be hard-pressed to find evidence that he is a lunatic and a hothead. When Modi campaigned for the BJP in India's general election this spring, his bread-and-butter, growth-centric message resonated. With 31 percent of the vote, the BJP managed to secure the first single-party majority in 25 years, which gives Modi unprecedented autonomy. While 31 percent of the vote might not sound very impressive, the Congress Party, now India's second-largest, won only 19 percent, with various lesser parties splitting the rest. The consensus view is that the BJP's strong showing was less a vote for the BJP than it was a vote for Modi, and his vague but oft-repeated promise of a brighter economic future for India. So how exactly does Modi intend to rev up India's growth engine? According to Sanjeev Sanyal, Deutsche Bank's global strategist and a leading light of India's pro-market right, Modi intends to mimic East Asia's strategy of relying on labor-intensive, export-oriented manufacturing. China grew rich not by becoming a hub for high-tech services but by becoming the workshop of the world. Now, however, China is aging rapidly, and wages for its workers are rising rapidly as well. India, with its large, growing, youthful population, is an increasingly attractive alternative for multinationals looking for a manufacturing hub. This manufacturing-first strategy, long championed by pro-market Indian economists like Arvind Panagariya and Jagdish Bhagwati, will entail a more rapid migration of poor Indians from small villages to large cities, and a huge productivity boost as they go from growing food to making things in enormous factories. While educated Indians have benefited from the first wave of reform, this potential second wave would have a more direct positive impact on the poorest of India's poor. There are no guarantees that Modi's strategy will work. To become a manufacturing powerhouse, India will have to reform its ridiculously stringent labor laws, which are very much the third rail of Indian politics, and spend vast sums of money on roads and power plants and all of the other basics of industrialization. This will be an issue, as the Indian bureaucracy is famously terrible at spending money wisely. If Modi succeeds, however, India will do more than alleviate poverty, important though that is. It will become the ""big, powerful country"" of Naipaul's dreams--the kind of place that can afford to ignore Pakistan, its hostile, dysfunctional neighbor, and that won't get pushed around by China. So you can see why Modi attracted support not just from India's urban middle class, but also from hundreds of thousands of people of Indian descent in countries around the world, including the United States: He is promising that all of these people will be able to walk a little taller in a world that has long dismissed India as a land of ""hunger and snakes."""

27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/will_mitt_romney_run_in_2016_the_former_gop_presidential_candidate_knows.html	"Romney 2012 could really have benefited from the speculation about Romney 2016. When Mitt Romney was a Republican presidential candidate, he had to suffer boomlets of enthusiasm for other contenders as GOP Wise Men rooted around for alternatives--what about Gov. Chris Christie? Was Jeb Bush going to run? Mitch Daniels? Now that Romney is not running, he's the object of desire. Could he be the White Knight candidate to rescue the party from its current weak field? The former Massachusetts governor has repeatedly denied that he wants to run again, but Byron York of the Washington Examiner reports that Romney is ""carefully weighing the pluses and minuses of another run."" One thing the two-time candidate might want to weigh is whether a process that consistently elevates the person not running will ultimately discard that person once he decides to run. It's a twist on the Groucho Marx line about not wanting to join a club that would have him as a member. Once you agree to become the GOP's savior candidate, you are immediately unworthy. Romney knows this. It's why he wisely told a group of supporters this June at his annual gathering in Park City, Utah: ""The unavailable is always the most attractive, right?"" Still, it must be hard to resist the breeze of redemption blowing his way recently. Romney is enjoying a rebirth because of disappointment in President Obama as well as some particular challenges to the likely GOP field. In a CNN poll, a majority of Americans (53 percent to 44 percent) said they would now vote for Romney over Obama. In Republican ranks, Romney looks more appealing as former White Knight candidates like Christie, Jeb Bush, and Gov. Scott Walker lose a little of their shine. When he was a candidate, Iowa treated Romney roughly, but in August he was way ahead of the pack in a poll there. (It's a poll that is meaningless as a predictor of voter sentiment but that gets passed around by people trying to whip up candidacies.) For many involved in Romney's last effort, there is reason to delight in this redemption that doesn't necessarily have to do with wanting to see Romney run again. Those who bundled money for him in 2012 now feel a little better around their friends whom they squeezed for the cash. That was harder to do when the Romney campaign ended and was considered an embarrassment. Those who worked for the candidate are enjoying a status upgrade, too. But is Romney really a stronger candidate than the members of the current field? A flawless imagined Romney presidency looks good compared with the up-close reality of the Obama presidency--particularly if you focus on Romney's wariness about the threat Russia poses and Obama's smug dismissal of the idea during the second debate. There's also the gross mismanagement at the Department of Veteran Affairs, the shoddy implementation of healthcare.gov, and the president's own admitted blindness to the emerging threat of ISIS, all of which suggest management failures at basic tasks that create an appetite for someone with Romney's executive experience--or any executive experience at all. But the task before Romney, if he chooses to run again, is not to be a good president, but to be a good candidate. There's nothing in the Obama blunders that improves how Romney looks as a candidate. He has all of the old baggage that caused him trouble in the 2012 race, plus that competition burdened him with a few soggy valises he'd now have to carry into any new run. Romney's first challenge would be the purity tests of the GOP primaries. He'd face the same skepticism from social conservatives wary of his faith and Tea Partiers who don't think he's a genuine conservative. He'd face at least one tougher opponent speaking for this group this time in Sen. Ted Cruz, who has pointed to Romney's nomination as proof that the party loses when it picks candidates with malleable principles. Cruz also has a special and enduring aversion to the Affordable Care Act, which would keep Romney discussing (and dodging) his Massachusetts health care plan, a topic over which he usually stumbles. Romney also faces high hurdles on the immigration issue. A recent Gallup poll shows Republican voters care about the issue above all others. Romney supported ""self-deportation,"" which would be an awkward position in 2016. On the one hand, it makes him Ann Coulter's favorite candidate; on the other hand, he won't ever hire anyone who thinks that being Ann Coulter's favorite candidate is a good thing--and he almost certainly doesn't believe it himself. When people refer to ""self-deportation"" these days, it is usually an example of a terrible mistake. It shows how candidates lunge to extremes that irrevocably harm the party in the general election. That was the position of the authors of the GOP autopsy report commissioned after the Romney loss. So what would Romney do? Does he change his position and face charges that he supports amnesty--which would be the response to any perceived moderation? Or, does he stick with his position on ""self-deportation"" and face upset from the wealthy moderates who are most supportive of him? No matter which way he goes, he risks reanimating the Romney-as-changeling story that so dogged him in his 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. Romney's other big problem is his starring role in the ""47 percent"" video, in which he suggested that the portion of America that wasn't going to vote for him wouldn't do so because it was addicted to government programs. Overcoming that video is a challenge that spans both the primary and general election. In the general election, his Democratic opponent will constantly hammer him as the Obama team did, raising questions about whether he really cares about the problems of middle-class families. Whether an opponent would again be successful in characterizing him this way is only part of the challenge. In a primary, voters would have to weigh whether carrying that kind of self-inflicted wound into the general election would make him a flawed candidate they shouldn't even bother elevating in the first place. The chatter about Romney 2016 presents a fascinating question to a candidate who is so highly valued for his business experience. One of Romney's tasks in the private sector was understanding long-term trends and differentiating them from the impulses of the moment. He, above all others, knows that regardless of what the elites in GOP fundraising circles say, presidential campaigns have little to do with evaluating candidates on whether they have the actual skills required for the job. So if Romney decides to run, he will face the same maddening competition that ground him up last time. If he goes ahead anyway, the decision could very well call into question the attribute that makes him an attractive president."	What Romney Thinks About When He Thinks About Running for President
28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/09/greg_abbott_is_campaigning_for_texas_hispanics_can_the_state_s_republicans.html	"No Republican in living memory has been elected to county office in Hidalgo County, near the southern-most tip of Texas. Yet state party grandees are hopeful that this year's gubernatorial election will deliver them a coup in Hidalgo and other border districts in the Rio Grande Valley--a region that spans four counties in all and has the highest concentration of Hispanic voters in the state. Last weekend, Greg Abbott, the GOP candidate for governor, was marching across McAllen, a city of 130,000 in Hidalgo County, campaigning to win over its primarily Hispanic residents. Beto Salinas, the mayor of a nearby town, has endorsed him. ""I've known him for a long time,"" Salinas told me. ""I think he is the right man for the job."" Salinas and Abbott are old friends, which helps to explain his support, but the notion that Abbott would appeal to other Hispanic voters may seem unlikely. As Texas' attorney general, Abbott defended a state plan to cut funds from the public school system, which would disproportionately affect poorer districts, and fought to uphold the state's draconian voter ID laws that make it harder for Hispanics to vote. In February, some were incensed when Abbott compared corruption at the Texas border to practices seen in a ""third-world country."" Yet Abbott is making a grab for votes in the Rio Grande Valley, and for the Hispanic vote in general. His wife is Hispanic, and he likes to say that he will bring the first Latina first lady into the governor's mansion. He has been flooding local stations with ads in English and Spanish, trotting out his Mexican-American mother-in-law for the campaign. Republicans were emboldened to take on south Texas after Wendy Davis, the Democratic candidate for governor, lost seven counties along the border during the primaries--including two counties in the Rio Grande Valley, Starr and Hidalgo. These were more than 80 percent Hispanic, and in the reliably blue part of a deep red state. Strategists surmised that Davis' stance on abortion had alienated Catholic, family-oriented Mexican-American voters. ""Abortion is more salient with Hispanic voters here,"" argues Steve Munisteri, the state GOP chairman. Others, like the Democratic congressman Henry Cuellar seem to agree. ""Texas Hispanics tend to be a little more conservative,"" he has opined. Munisteri also points to polling that boosts Republican hopes of making inroads with Hispanics, who make up more than a quarter of Texas' eligible voters. Earlier this year, a poll from Gallup showed a decline in the number of registered or Democratic-leaning Hispanics in the state: In 2008, 53 percent identified this way, but by 2013, that number had dropped to 46 percent. Republican identification among Hispanics, meanwhile, rose 4 percentage points, from 23 percent five years ago to 27 percent. Though a June poll from the Texas Politics Project put Davis ahead among Hispanics, the gap between her and Abbott is smaller than expected, 35 percent to 29 percent in favor of Davis. (Among blacks, 54 percent support Davis, and only 5 percent support Abbott.) Though getting the majority of the Hispanic vote is unlikely, Munisteri predicts that Abbott will come close to the high-water mark set by George W. Bush in 1998, when he won 45 percent. Others are skeptical. ""I would be very surprised if Abbott got to 40 percent,"" says Jerry Polinard of the University of Texas-Pan American in Edinburg, the Hidalgo County seat. Anti-Republican sentiment has run deep since the Bush years: Residents dislike the GOP's tougher tone on immigration nationally and in Texas in particular. (The image of a rifle-toting Gov. Rick Perry patrolling the border to fend off displaced kids sums up why.) Any good feeling from the 1990s and early-aughts has long since eroded. Republicans have tried to reframe the issue as one of heightening border security, rather than tightened immigration. Abbott has been careful not to couch discussions about the border in punitive, nativist terms. Whether that has been successful is debatable. Mayor Salinas says the increased presence of Department of Public Safety police dispatched to his town, Mission, is welcomed, but Polinard notes that the Republican penchant for portraying the border as a sordid, lawless place angers local merchants. As for Davis' losses during the primaries, they came about because ""she didn't do enough campaigning and get her message out enough then,"" thinks Amancio Chapa, a Mission local who has long been involved in Texas politics. It's possible that some might have disagreed with her stance on abortion, he says, but it is not the issue that comes near the top of south Texans' concerns. Education, health care, and jobs consistently rank highest. When it comes to border issues, like this summer's influx of child migrants from Central America, Hispanics in South Texas were far more likely to say that this signaled the need for immigration reform, not greater border security, according to research from Josh Ulibarri of Lake Research Partners, a Democratic pollster. Davis has been keen to highlight Abbott's failings, airing ads about his involvement with questionable health funds (the ones that got Rick Perry into trouble) while highlighting her own education pitch--""La fuerza de Wendy Davis,"" a recent ad, stresses that she ""will fight to protect the funds for our schools."" Her efforts will probably ensure that the vote in South Texas remains solidly Democratic this election. But winning there may prove a Pyrrhic victory: Any gains Republicans make in the Rio Grande Valley will be read as important progress for the GOP, even if it is not an outright win. It would indicate that party identity among Texas Hispanics is fluid and break the assumption that they will always vote Democrat. That would be bad news for those who had high hopes of turning the state purple. ""Before this election, I couldn't get the RNC to give us anything,"" Munisteri told me. ""But now we've got permanent offices in South Texas, in El Paso, in Laredo--and it's thanks to Wendy Davis and Battleground Texas (the PAC set up in 2013 to boost minority Democratic voters)."" A vote for Greg Abbott in Hidalgo County may not swing the outcome of this election, but it may attract more dollars to fund Republicans' efforts to convert Texas Hispanics."

The Rev. Al Sharpton was part of the event, and he was about to take questions from those assembled when the news broke that Attorney General Eric Holder intended to resign from the administration. Naturally, Sharpton had a few words for the occasion. ""There is no attorney general who has shown a commitment to civil rights like Eric Holder,"" said Sharpton, ""If he is resigning, the civil rights community is losing the most effective civil rights attorney general in American history."" That is high praise, but it's hard to say it's unreasonable or unjustified. When President Obama entered office, the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department was in shambles, neglected by President Bush and staffed with a coterie of partisan operatives. Long-serving lawyers left the office, case files were closed with little explanation, political appointees sought to block liberals from career positions, and anti-discrimination efforts were few and far between. At his confirmation hearing at the beginning of Obama's term, Holder made the Civil Rights Division his priority, telling the Senate, ""In the last eight years, vital federal laws designed to protect rights in the workplace, the housing market, and the voting booth have languished. ... Improper political hiring has undermined this important mission. That must change. And I intend to make this a priority as attorney general."" To that end, Holder took aggressive steps to repair the damage of the previous administration and restore the traditional priorities of the Civil Rights Division. On voting rights, Holder was a strong advocate against voter identification laws, attacking the 2012 Texas law as a ""political pretext to disenfranchise American citizens of their most precious right"" and comparing some practices to Jim Crow laws. ""Many of those without IDs would have to travel great distances to get them--and some would struggle to pay for the documents they might need to obtain them. We call those poll taxes,"" he said. After the Supreme Court struck down key parts of the Voting Rights Act--the strongest push in a broad rear-guard action against voting rights and access--Holder pledged to do everything possible to defend the VRA from further encroachment. He kept his word. Under a provision of the VRA that allows states to be brought under new federal scrutiny if violations of the 14th or 15th Amendment have occurred, the Department of Justice sued North Carolina and Texas over their controversial voter ID laws. Likewise, this year, it joined lawsuits against similar voting laws in Ohio and Wisconsin. Holder took the lead in other civil rights areas. Under his tenure the Department of Justice has opened 20 investigations into police departments across the country. As Nicole Flatow and Ian Millhiser note for ThinkProgress, these investigations have ended with ""scathing findings of police brutality, abuse of the mentally ill, and excessive deadly force, and agreements known as consent decrees that bind cities to federal monitoring and other reforms."" Indeed, these investigations were one reason for Thursday's press conference with Sharpton and others. This summer the Justice Department turned its attention to Ferguson, Missouri, where racial bias formed the backdrop for protests in the police killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown. In their plea for more federal involvement, the Brown and Garner families approached Holder as an ally to push, not an adversary to convince. Other parts of Holder's civil rights record are mixed. In his early years as attorney general, he increased prosecution of marijuana dispensaries and refused to reschedule the drug from its current classification, where it sits with heroin and LSD. At the same time, however, Holder pushed for retroactive enforcement of the Fair Sentencing Act--which narrowed the crack cocaine sentencing disparity tenfold--and has refrained from challenging the marijuana legalization experiments in Colorado and Washington. He's backed away from mandatory drug sentences, ensuring that federal prosecutors avoid the draconian punishments of the last few decades. ""Although incarceration has a role to play in our justice system, widespread incarceration at the federal, state, and local levels is both ineffective and unsustainable,"" he said. ""It imposes a significant economic burden--totaling $80 billion in 2010 alone--and it comes with human and moral costs that are impossible to calculate."" Indeed, Holder has supported a change from the U.S. Sentencing Commission that would shorten incarceration for thousands of nonviolent inmates and keep many more people out of prison for long periods. More broadly, he's criticized the ""school-to-prison pipeline""--threatening lawsuits for schools that use criminal punishments for routine misbehavior. Holder has also been a rhetorical foil to the calm and conciliatory President Obama, voicing anger and indignation on racism and racial injustice. ""Though this nation has proudly thought of itself as an ethnic melting pot, in things racial we have always been and continue to be, in too many ways, essentially a nation of cowards,"" he said in 2009. Likewise, in a commencement address earlier this year, he gave direct rebuke to conservative claims that race had diminished in American public life. ""Chief Justice John Roberts has argued that the path to ending racial discrimination is to give less consideration to the issue of race altogether,"" he said. ""This presupposes that racial discrimination is at a sufficiently low ebb that it doesn't need to be actively confronted."" For Holder, that was nonsense. ""The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race,"" he continued, ""is to speak openly and candidly on the subject of race."" As I argued in May, Holder was the ""anger translator"" for a president constrained from blunt talk on race. Now, Holder's tenure wasn't perfect, and as Eric Posner notes for Slate, there are areas of real disappointment. Not only did Holder give legal support to the administration's policy of targeted killings, but his Justice Department has ""enthusiastically defended the state secrets privilege,"" used surveillance on journalists, and prosecuted more government officials for alleged leaks than all of his predecessors combined. Moreover, to the chagrin of many on the left, Holder's Justice Department has done little to punish the banks and bankers responsible for the financial crisis. For as much as Holder wants to leave a legacy as a civil rights attorney general, there's a chance he'll be remembered instead for his missteps and conspicuous omissions. With that said, I don't think that's likely. In his five years as attorney general, Holder has held the line against new efforts to gut civil rights laws and restrict the franchise. And he's done so in the face of tremendous opposition from conservatives, who approached him with fierce loathing. In a first for a sitting Cabinet member, he was held in contempt by the House Republican majority, and he's been denounced as a ""menace to the rule of law,"" who ""stok[ed] racial division"" and ""turned the power of the Justice Department into a racially motivated turnout machine for the Democratic Party."" It's possible that with less acrimonious politics, Holder--like his boss, Barack Obama--would have been more successful. All of which is to say this: Unlike Al Sharpton, I'm not sure that Eric Holder was ""the most effective civil rights attorney general in American history."" But he was a very good one, and given the times, that's just as vital."	Eric Holder Was the Best Attorney General Our Politics Would Permit
