Thanks to the magic of Twitter, we can now experience all of the spinning, spatting, and snarking from both sides of the aisle in real time. Below are the live Tweets of a few dozen liberal pundits and partisans on the left-hand side of the screen and a few dozen conservative pundits and partisans on the right-hand side of the screen. You can see what both sides are saying about Barack Obama's State of the Union speech, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers' response for the GOP, and Sen. Rand Paul's personal response while watching the entire bloody affair on your TV or via the player above. And on the off chance that any news actually does happen, you'll be the first to see that too! Welcome to tweet alley.	The Dueling Conservative and Liberal Twitter Responses to the State of the Union
1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/01/barack_obama_and_state_of_the_union_the_president_is_like_macgyver_with.html	"In advance of President Obama's State of the Union address, he and his aides have been talking about his desk set. ""I have a pen and I have a phone,"" the president has said, a declaration meant to convey that he will act if Congress doesn't. ""The president views the power of his presidency in two areas,"" political adviser Dan Pfeiffer said on CNN's State of the Union. ""His pen, which is the executive orders, the presidential memorandums. Also the phone, where what he can do is he can pick up the phone, bring together American citizens, and business to commit on key issues."" The MacGyver presidency is upon us. In the eponymous 1980s television show, the hero was regularly getting himself out of scrapes by using everyday objects in unexpected and winning ways. In one episode, he combined a microphone, a rubber mat, and a candle. The result: a defibrillator. In another, he used branches and rosary beads to make a rock catapult. The series fizzled out before he could achieve the promise of combining a colander and a first-edition Victor Hugo. In the sixth year of a presidency, amid acute partisanship and low approval ratings, a president and his aides are also tied down and running out of options. So they too are trying to work magic from simple household items like a phone and a pen. Don't get your hopes up. MacGyver never had to deal with the Constitution and the separation of powers--two things the president has often said limit his range of motion. Plus, it's a political year and if he were to truly stretch the office of the presidency to overcome Republicans in areas like environmental protection, he might create political fights that would backfire on Democrats running in tough races in Republican parts of the country. Going it alone with his desk set wasn't his first choice. He has tried bipartisanship, schmoozing (remember last year's dinners with Republican senators?), bullying, and rallying national opinion. He even dreamed winning re-election would give him warrants for action. The Obama team has largely discarded these stratagems because they weren't effective, whether because the president didn't try in earnest or because he faced immovable opposition. So now the president is trying another gambit. It's a sign of creativity, an important presidential attribute. Bold, persistent experimentation was what FDR and Bill Clinton called it. They said it was a crucial recipe for the office. But how bold? How persistent? ""When you're involved in sales you have to worry about overpromising,"" says Ohio State law professor Peter Shane, an expert in separation of powers. ""The president generally does not have any unilateral authority to create on his own rights and legal obligations for the general public."" The president agrees with that view. David Remnick writes in a recent profile in The New Yorker about Obama calming a crowd of Democratic activists excited by the mere mention of executive orders. ""Before everybody starts clapping, that's not how it works. We've got this Constitution, we've got this whole thing about separation of powers. So there is no shortcut to politics, and there's no shortcut to democracy."" Another reason to temper expectations is that the president has been trying to use executive orders to go around Congress for quite some time now, which means this year's effort is not as revelatory a pathway as it is sometimes presented by his aides. This New York Times story, headlined ""Shift on Executive Power Lets Obama Bypass Rivals,"" written almost two years ago, reads just like the ones from this weekend. Each has the moment of revelation when Obama called on aides to look for ways around the roadblocks and each has the promise of tough action. ""If Congress refuses to act, I've said that I'll continue to do everything in my power to act without them,"" the president declared in March 2012. And so he has, directing the Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act, issuing a memorandum to stop the deportation of children of undocumented workers, and cutting refinancing fees for federally insured mortgages. The president and his team say he will take executive action on the environment and the economy, with a special emphasis on improving social mobility. This may require a smaller definition of action and promoting a longer timeline for results than administrations usually use. An aide described one of the president's proposed actions as merely ""starting a conversation."" Or, the president might simply try to cajole CEOs of private companies. Sometimes the president will hope to just plant a program he hopes will grow in other administrations. Earlier this month the president announced the creation of a manufacturing hub in North Carolina to spur innovation. It's a tiny version of a larger program he proposed in last year's State of the Union address. It won't have a big effect on the economy, but if the program succeeds perhaps it will create the appetite for developing it further in later administrations. ""Executive power is a seed,"" says John Hudak of the Brookings Institution, author of a forthcoming book Presidential Pork. ""Once you get a project up and running, if people hate it, a president can get rid of it, but if it takes root and interest groups get involved and the public likes it, it gets harder and harder to reverse that action. A program that develops through this executive action then gets authorized by Congress. The Peace Corps started that way."" Other actions the president could take would be to encourage employers with federal contracts to hire the long-term unemployed, or mandate it within the federal workforce. (Update, Jan. 28, 7:15 a.m.: The president has decided to raise the minimum wage for workers under new federal contracts to $10.10 an hour, up from $7.25.) He could promote new regulations that would protect consumers through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or go ahead with the long expected new performance standards from the EPA regulating carbon emissions from new and existing power plants. There's more that can be done with clean energy. The Center for New Energy Economy suggested 200 executive actions on clean energy alone. These larger actions will create political challenges that could break in unpredictable ways. On the one hand, they could create clarifying fights with Republicans over issues Democrats care about. Such fights might also bleed over into the budgeting process as Republicans try to use policy riders to bar funding to some of the president's new executive gambits. Fights can be useful in rallying the base, but they can also put Democrats running in Republican states in a pickle. They are already fending off attacks over the Affordable Care Act, which their opponents have successfully portrayed as a big government power grab that is ruining the economy. New EPA regulations would fit into that same storyline. In MacGyver's world, the pen and the phone could be used to bring peace to Fallujah, so perhaps the more realistic test for the president's sixth State of the Union is the one faced by MacGyver's scriptwriters in the show's sixth year. Will the audience buy it? The White House team has to hope they have better luck. MacGyver was canceled the next year."	Why President Obama Is This Year's MacGyver

He was just one of 168 voting members of the Republican National Committee, just one member of the standing committee on rules, and he knew he'd be steamrolled when he tried to change those rules. The next Republican primary would be fought largely along the stricter guideline set up at the 2012 GOP convention in Tampa--set up by the victorious allies of Mitt Romney, people who should have stopped mattering by now. ""The only reason it passed is that it was forced down our throats,"" said Blackwell, standing at a microphone and facing the committee heads. ""The case has been made that there are many people who favor no proportionality at all, and favor a one-day primary. I dispute that. I would like a show of hands--how many people on this committee would favor a one-day primary? I know how Ron Kaufman feels, but anybody else?"" Blackwell's RNC peers got a chuckle out of that one. Kaufman, a Republican operative who is inevitably described as an ""influence peddler"" and never quibbles, had backed Mitt Romney in 2012. He'd helped the RNC undo all the reforms that loosened that primary, allowing--in Romneyland thinking--a bunch of losers to drag the candidate into extra primaries and debates. When Blackwell joined a convention floor protest of the new rules, trying to restore the power of state conventions over party-sanctioned primaries, the mics were cut off. ""I've represented Virginia on the RNC since 1988,"" Blackwell told Tea Party activists after the vote. ""Nothing like this has happened before in living memory at a Republican National Convention."" Two years later, when Blackwell went after Kaufmann, he was gaveled out of order. ""Mr. Blackwell, we are not going to allow personal attacks or snide comments,"" said the rules chair. ""It's not a snide comment,"" said Blackwell. ""I think Mr. Kaufman is proud of his position."" He probably was; he was winning. A few hours of family feuding later, the RNC had protected the rules that set up a tighter, shorter primary, focused on coronating a front-runner as quickly as possible. Only four states would vote in February--Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada. For the first two weeks of March, states would have to assign delegates proportionately; after that, they could go winner take all. The convention could happen as early as June. This was all designed to defeat the Democratic candidate--""she who must not be named,"" as RNC general counsel John Ryder put it. The affirmation of the tighter rules was just the latest and most public victory by a Republican establishment that believes it had gone too easy on insurgents. On Tuesday, Iowa Republicans met for their biennial precinct caucuses. In recent years, these had come to be dominated by the ""freedom movement"" that supported Ron Paul for president. Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad printed up at least three fliers encouraging Republicans to show up, implicitly to out-vote the Paul faction. Three days later, Iowa GOP Chairman A.J. Spiker was at the RNC meeting, downplaying the Branstad move. ""People talk about that, but who isn't a Branstad delegate?"" asked Spiker, who was lifted up to the chairmanship by the Paul movement. ""I mean, I support the governor's re-election. Everybody's going to be a Branstad delegate. It was average turn-out--Bob Vander Plaats pushed turn-out with his evangelical group, the state party pushed turn-out, liberty people pushed turn-out. I saw anti-common-core people there."" That's just it, though--the Republicans outside of Paul's movement, or outside the Tea Party, will not be caught slumbering again. ""We tried to always be nice to them,"" grumbled rules committee member and Pennsylvania GOP Chairman Rob Gleason, ""but you know what? It didn't go their way, and they left."" In Utah, party grandees are trying to end the convention system that unseated Sen. Bob Bennett in 2010 and created a primary challenge for Sen. Orrin Hatch in 2012. Inside the RNC, the Paul-friendly activists who took over state parties recently have been co-opted as much as possible. It's a slow process, but Blackwell's charge didn't really halt it. Spiker was invited on a junket to Taiwan. James Smack, a Paul supporter in Nevada, went from party chairman to RNC committee member, and was invited into a working group to find a compromise on the rules. They fell far short of what Blackwell wanted. After one vote, the defeated Blackwell marveled at how Smack had been ""worked on."" Smack, who wore a ""STAND WITH RAND"" button above his party identification badge, saw it differently. An insurgent candidate could use this calendar and these rules to win, according to Smack. ""It's going to have to be a solid, grassroots candidate,"" said Smack. ""It's going to be someone who competes in those first four states and can break through in that two-week proportionality period."" And as long as a caucus state didn't hold a ""preference poll,"" the kind of event that pulls in national media--well, sure, it could still be up to activists to swarm a state convention for their candidate. ""There may be a legal challenge or two that comes down the line,"" said Smack. ""I know Nevada's not going to bring one."" The Ron Paul insurgency is turning seven years old this year. It's what got Smack back into politics. That and his outrage at local laws against pit bulls. As we finished talking, Smack's wife appeared with a cellphone loaded with photos of their beloved pit bull. ""His name is January Genuine Midnight son,"" she said. ""His name is Bruiser,"" corrected James Smack. These were the kinds of Republicans who'd discovered or rediscovered politics at the end of the Bush era or in the early Obama years. These were the sorts of people who'd terrified the ""establishment."" For now, outnumbered, they were going along with limits to their power in the cause of defeating She Who Must Not Be Named."

""He's given us the tool to create the pro-life context."" It's Wednesday morning at the Washington headquarters of the Family Research Council. A small but growing crowd of pro-lifers, groggy but quickened by coffee and freezing cold, is trickling into a conference room for the ninth annual ProLifeCon. When the pep rally is over, they will join tens of thousands of comrades for the annual March for Life. Carter, a thoughtful Mike Huckabee campaign veteran who now works with the Southern Baptist Convention, is delivering the antithesis of a pep talk. ""Activists have an image problem,"" he explains. ""When people think of activists, they think of people who are militant, unhygienic, and eccentric."" Over to one corner, listening to this, is the man who drives a ""truth truck"" covered in anti-abortion slogans and pictures of broken fetuses around Washington. The man, whose name is Ronald Brock, sips his coffee. ""I bet I could go into any one of your Facebook accounts and within 30 posts I could find a picture of a baby,"" says Carter. ""We see pictures of babies daily--sometimes, even hourly. Babies have become as ubiquitous on Facebook as cats are on YouTube. They have created a more pro-life context."" Carter remembers how his Facebook feed covered the 2013 trial of Kermit Gosnell, a Philadelphia abortion doctor who performed illegal procedures (and was convicted of murdering three infants) in a retch-inducing, blood-soaked office. ""In one post, there was a post of a mother holding a baby and in the post below was a story about the murders."" The lesson of all this, according to Carter, is that turning America against abortion is going to require less doom and more Disney. ""We don't need to do this by showing bloody fetuses to get a gag reflex,"" he says. ""We need to do this by invoking our neighbors' natural love for children. We do this by showing babies as natural parts of our lives."" If anyone disagrees, none say so. The March for Life, which commemorates every anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision, is friendlier and more media-ready than ever. Most people credit that to the leadership of Jeanne Monahan, dubbed a ""photogenic, warm former federal government policy worker""--yes, another one of those--by the Washington Post. Anti-abortion activists are acutely aware of both how the press portrays them and what the ascendant libertarian/business faction of the Republican Party thinks of them. They're aware, and they want to prove the squishes wrong. Last year's theme was ""40 = 55m,"" as in the years since Roe and the number of abortions carried out under its guidelines. This year's theme is the glory of adoption. At the Family Research Council, where security guard Leo Johnson stopped a crazed gunman with a backpack full of Chick-fil-A sandwiches from martyring the staff (an inspiring shrine to him stands in the foyer), the emphasis is on not on condemning sinners. It's how to persuade people who are probably ready to agree with the cause. So we hear from Brian Fisher, the founder of Online for Life, who is beamed in over video. He walks us through the success of his group's Facebook account and through an app that alerts users when someone has called one of 45 mobile pregnancy resource centers. ""Someone considering abortion in Los Angeles just contacted a PRC,"" reads one alert. These centers have been pilloried by pro-choice advocates for years, as has legislation requiring women see ultrasounds before having abortions, as have longer waiting periods--as have the all legislative wins racked up in states since 2011. Pro-lifers are told that this makes them look obsessive and that they are fighting a ""war on women."" Their response, as of today, is to accentuate all the positives of life while asking pro-choicers how they can be so gruesome. This is the thinking behind a resolution that will come before the Republican National Committee at its winter meeting, happening this week. It does not mention Roe--the party platform already pledges to overturn Roe, eventually. It just runs down poll numbers to prove that people really love babies and argues that ""staying silent fails to alert voters to the Democrats' extreme pro-abortion stances, which voters are repelled by."" The resolution will be introduced by Ellen Barrosse, a board member of American Principles Project. Frank Cannon, who runs that group, points to its 2013 ""GOP autopsy"" for evidence that the abortion issue can be spun against Democrats. That report was conceived as a direct riposte to the RNC's own autopsy report. ""If you agree to truce strategy where you don't define your opponent's position on abortion, it keeps your voters from galvanizing and being out there,"" says Cannon. ""It convinces people in the middle you're not serious. If you have no affirmative position and let Democrats ask you about rape and incest, then you're vulnerable. But if you're dealing with actual legislation, and it's legislation that people like, then the Democrats are vulnerable."" The RNC doesn't disagree. Chairman Reince Priebus carved out time from the RNC winter meeting to let committee members bus down to the Mall and participate in the March for Life. He makes a very brief appearance at the Family Research Council, chastening a (mostly absent) media for covering the RNC's pro-life moves as something new or dangerous. ""We're the pro-life party,"" he says. ""This should not be earth-shattering news, that the RNC is supporting the March for Life. Obviously, people were very appreciative of what we did, but I thought it was very natural. I want to make you proud of this party. If you don't stand for the things you say you believe in, you know, there's not much value in an organization."" A few more speeches, an update from Rick Santorum--who is wearing a jersey from the University of Dubuque and reminding March for Lifers that he won 11 states in the last primary--and it's off to the Mall.* I run into Ronald Brock, who it turns out had no problem with the baby-photos-not-bloody-photos pitch. ""We should use the photos that show the positive and the ones that show the ugly truth,"" he says. ""When I look at a picture and it bothers me to the point where my stomach is turning, I gotta use it."" He heads into his ""truth truck,"" and that's it for the mangled-fetus photos. The marchers prefer pictures of babies in the womb or newly born tykes smiling into the camera. One of them hoists an Elmo doll adorned with a PRO-LIFE sticker, moving it up and down as House Majority Leader Eric Cantor tells the crowd that his House will ban taxpayer funding for abortion. I get out of range of a teenager who keeps alternately humming and singing the barricades tune from Les Miserables and end up talking to Doug Braendel, a pro-life activist from Pennsylvania's rural Bedford county. He's thrilled about how life-size models of fetuses at early stages of development can turn people away from abortion. ""A biology teacher in a high school had one of these models and kept it in his drawer with the pencils,"" Braendel says. ""He hadn't done anything with it when some kid said, 'Teacher, I don't have a pencil.' When he did that, he saw the model! And later, when a young lady was contemplating abortion, the kid took her to the pencil drawer and showed her the model. She didn't do what, you know, she would have done."" What hasn't been effective? Braendel thinks about it. Republican-run Pennsylvania has actually passed two new anti-abortion laws, one that raises standards for clinics (thereby, hopefully, shuttering them) and one that bars health care plans in the exchanges from paying for abortions. But a bill to require ultrasounds for women who showed up at clinics sputtered, after ""Planned Parenthood and the rest"" made hay of Virginia's transvaginal ultrasound bill. The lesson, according to Braendel, was that there was ever more reframing to do. ""Abortion is much more tantamount to rape than a vaginal ultrasound,"" he says. *Correction, Jan. 23, 2014: This article originally misstated that Rick Santorum was wearing a jersey from Davenport university.

4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/01/chris_christie_s_popularity_and_the_media_the_new_jersey_governor_s_ties.html	"The second inauguration of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie followed most of the rhythms of his first. In 2010, a much heavier and greener politician told his audience that ""the era of runaway spending and higher and higher taxes has not worked."" In 2014, he denied ""the power of almighty government to fix any problem, real or imagined."" In 2010, New Jersey was a possible ""home for growth"" once a few failed liberal policies were undone. In 2014, the state had become a sturdy fortress ""for those who prefer economic growth and opportunity to redistribution and higher taxes."" One of the few new beats, one the media picked up on immediately--and for obvious reasons--was a whack at the press. ""We have to be willing to play outside the red and blue boxes that the media pundits put us in,"" said Christie. That line caused a warm rush of applause, and like so many applause lines, it made no sense. Just who were these mysterious pundits cramming Christie into a ""red box""? The ones who marveled at his approval numbers among Democrats? The ones who told Republicans to copy Christie if they wanted to save their party? MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski, who got a 15-minute phone call from Christie after his two-hour ""Bridgeghazi"" press conference? Well, not her, but we're on to something with that ""MSNBC"" bit. In the last 72-odd hours, the biggest development in the unending Christie drama has been the governor's turn against the cable network. (Disclosure: I often appear on MSNBC and in fact appeared on it on Tuesday to discuss Christie.) Over the weekend, MSNBC's Steve Kornacki, a network host and reporter with fracker-deep roots in New Jersey, interviewed Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer and backed up her story that the governor had withheld some Hurricane Sandy relief money until a development he wanted was approved. The governor's office responded with a lengthy, footnoted statement, the kind that's usually issued during a presidential campaign. ""MSNBC is a partisan network that has been openly hostile to Governor Christie,"" said spokesman Colin Reed, ""and almost gleeful in their efforts attacking him, even taking the unprecedented step of producing and airing a nearly three-minute attack ad against him this week."" The spoof ad appeared on Lawrence O'Donnell's show, not Kornacki's, but that was almost beside the point--the statement also shamed MSNBC for coverage by Rachel Maddow (""offered a purely speculative theory"") and Chris Matthews (""comparing Governor Christie to Nixon""). The New York Times called this a scene from a ""messy divorce."" But what choice did Christie's office have? If he's going to run for president, the next voters he'll have to impress are Republicans and Republican-leaning independents in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. Right now, maybe, they're hearing only the worst about Christie. ""The bridge story is all they know about his tenure,"" said former South Carolina GOP chairman Katon Dawson. But what will they think in a year, when he (probably) declares, or in two years, when they vote? That's plenty of time for Christie to look like the victim of a scandal-crazed media that wants to create and cover a Clinton Restoration. OK, it hasn't worked like that so far. So far, conservative media analysis of the bridge scandal has followed this pattern: acknowledge the story, ask why [insert Obama scandal] didn't get covered like this, cry bias. ""The amount of attention paid to Chris Christie makes the coverage of Benghazi, at the same time, the coverage of the IRS, pale in significance,"" said Rudy Giuliani on Fox News Sunday. Two Sundays later, National Review's Jonah Goldberg appeared on Fox's Media Buzz to say basically the same thing. According to Media Matters, the bridge scandal has received one hour of Fox News coverage for every 12 hours of CNN coverage and nearly every 15 hours on MSNBC. Fox's light touch shouldn't shock anybody. Roger Ailes had wanted Christie to run for president in 2010, inviting him and Rush Limbaugh to a dinner/pitch meeting at his home. (The pitch didn't work, obviously.) Limbaugh has described the scandal as a media attempt to ""destroy Chris Christie."" New Jersey Democrats have the power to investigate Christie all year, but if nothing else emerges to damage him, at some point this becomes a story of liberals versus the right. ""I think this whole thing is helping Christie with precisely the people who were most skeptical of him, at least in terms of Republican primary voters,"" suggested former New Hampshire GOP chairman Fergus Cullen. ""Last month, Scott Brown headlined a fundraiser for the New Hampshire GOP and Brown got picketed by a large group of gun activists. They and other conservative activists would give Christie a hard time because of his ideology, too. But if the media is going after him this hard on something so peripheral to Christie himself, he can't be all bad, right?"" Cullen pointed to some helpful data from Public Policy Polling. In New Hampshire, Republican voters who were contacted from Jan. 9 to Jan. 12 didn't much change their opinions about Christie. Eighty-nine percent of them had heard of the bridge story. A majority, 78 percent, said that their opinion of him hadn't budged or that it had actually improved. That's at odds with more recent national polls but not with the patterns of partisan reaction. Liberal support for Bill Clinton stayed solid, or increased, as Republicans continued hitting him with independent counsels. ""There's lots of precedent, for politicians making mistakes then coming back from them, like Clinton,"" said Dawson. ""The poll numbers, they'll move around. The press is going to stay on Christie for a while. If it turns out the governor has told an untruth, it'll end his ambitions."" If it didn't--if there is no damning email after months of investigations--Christie could recover his fan base among the Morning Joe set while coming across to Republican primary voters as a newly contrite guy who'd been treated unfairly. ""A decent apology works real well,"" said Dawson. ""All you have to do is ask Mark Sanford."" One problem with this: Sanford never really irritated GOP primary voters the way Christie did when he praised President Obama's response to Hurricane Sandy. Limbaugh called it ""the fatal blow"" to a possible national campaign for the New Jersey governor. The few Mitt Romney donors who've gone on the record against Christie have cited the Sandy ""embrace"" as the reason. Media bashing can help sell Christie to conservative voters, but they have so many reasons to distrust him. ""I don't think it will be possible for the man that almost singularly ensured Obummer's re-election to generate conservative sympathy via shared media disdain,"" said Iowa conservative radio host Steve Deace. ""Most of the conservatives I talk to in Red State America view the GOP establishment and the liberal media as one in the same--united against us. Now, I certainly think there's a lot of conservative enthusiasm for putting Christie and the liberal media together on the same raft for a simultaneous Viking funeral."""	Can Chris Christie Endure His Scandals by Turning Against Media That Cover Them?
5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/01/robert_gates_duty_the_former_defense_secretary_says_every_good_president.html	"Like many people with a strong view about Robert Gates' new book, Duty, I have not read it. I did, however, attend a reporters' breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor where the former defense secretary spoke for an hour. Gates confirmed what was obvious from the excerpts of his book. His views about Presidents Obama and Bush are varied and complex and far more positive about both than the initial reports suggested. ""I have the growing feeling over the last week that my book has become like Lenin,"" he said. ""You can find in it whatever you want to support your position."" Since Gates has served in eight administrations, I asked him about my favorite topic: the qualities required to be an effective president. The two he picked: temperament and a sense of humor. ""I can't improve on what Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. said about FDR in the early '30s, when he said he has 'a second-rate intellect and a first-rate temperament.' You look at our greatest presidents, from Washington to Lincoln to Teddy Roosevelt to FDR to, in my view, Truman, Eisenhower, Reagan--I think Holmes' description fits those guys very well. And they surrounded themselves with really smart people and were willing to listen to them."" The quality of temperament, about which I wrote in a multipart series on the presidency, is not easy to spot in a candidate. The crucible of a campaign does approximate a slice of presidential life--the personal stress and the requirement for focus when the noise machine is pointed right at your ear. But presidential temperament can only really be tested in the office, because that's the only place on the planet where you have to deal with decisions of that weight. In a president, temperament is the habits of mind that allow you to take the longer view when your emotions tell you otherwise, that keep you from abusing power when no one is looking, that make you enough of an adult to take harsh criticism and not so much of a baby that you react to every dumb blog entry. This view of temperament leads Gates to a somewhat counterintuitive conclusion: Executive experience isn't a necessary requirement for the presidency. This is not a historically crazy claim. After all, Abraham Lincoln didn't have any executive experience, but executive experience is talked about as an essential quality on the campaign trail. President Obama's critics often cite his lack of executive experience as a central flaw of his presidency. During the hiccup, flop, and clang of the healthcare.gov launch, the fact that the president had never run as much as a lemonade stand was cited as a reason he'd not been able to get his team to operate efficiently. But Gates' argument is that President Obama shows no deficiency from lacking executive experience. ""I think if you look at governors, they tend to--the executive experience at least helps them figure out a decision-making process. But that said, I don't want to make that too rigid because the truth is, as I write in the book, Obama had never run anything. But I never saw anybody, particularly anybody who had not run a big organization, take so quickly and eagerly to making executive decisions. And he welcomed the opportunity to make hard decisions. ... When he had to make a decision in a hurry, he could be very decisive in a very short period of time in matters of life and death, and the Osama Bin Laden raid is a good example of that. So I think that he, even in terms of decision-making, the lack of executive experience has not inhibited him or been a significant drawback."" This is such a recommendation, the Obama team would want to put it in a campaign ad. The president is not running again, of course, but Sens. Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio, who are contemplating running for president with Obama-like resumes, should take comfort. The second important quality for a president to have, says Gates, is a sense of humor. ""I mean that in a very serious way,"" he said. ""I think a sense of humor and a sense of the absurd reflects a balance and a perspective on the world that is very healthy. Of all the presidents that I worked for, there are only two who had no discernible sense of humor: Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. I rest my case."""	Robert Gates Says Any Good President Has to Have a Sense of Humor
6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/01/obama_nsa_speech_advice_for_the_president_from_the_aclu.html	The president on Friday will give a long-awaited speech addressing what he intends to do about National Security Agency surveillance programs that have come to light since June. According to press reports, his administration is still culling recommendations, and it is unclear whether he will make the most important decision of all: to no longer spy on American citizens without cause. Between the President's Review Group report and 30-odd pieces of legislation introduced to date, there are dozens of recommendations. But it's essential that the administration and Congress refuse to fritter around the edges. They need to squarely take on whether we should live under secret law that allows mass domestic surveillance. It is the main thing that matters now and the only thing that will be remembered by generations to come. These are the main points the president needs to make in his speech to bring the country's surveillance regime back in line with the Constitution. First, the government must end bulk collection of records and communications of both Americans and people abroad. The administration should no longer request broad court orders to collect daily information on Americans' phone calls under Patriot Act Section 215 because the president's review group, a federal judge, and members of Congress all found the program to be ineffective, and the privacy violations and risks of abuse are just too large. This is about much more than phone records--these tools can obtain emails, financial records, Internet records, and more. Bulk spying must also be ended under similar tools like national security letters, pen registers, and the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. Second, there is an international human right to privacy, and the administration must vow to work with civil society, Congress, and foreign governments to determine how it applies in a world that is more digitally connected than ever before. Ordinary citizens of foreign nations who are not suspected of wrongdoing--not just their elected officials--deserve privacy in their communications. Third, the government should promote real transparency and end secret law. In the interest of public oversight and openness, our government must inform the public and Congress about these spying programs. There must not be any secret law in the United States. While information about specific targets may remain secret, absolute secrecy prevents Americans from understanding the contours of their government's powers. The government has to explain the scope of its authority, the nature of information collected, the number of people affected, and how collected information is used. Public oversight can be strengthened by allowing traditional public federal courts to hear cases and create more reasonable nondisclosure orders so that there is fair constitutional review. Fourth, the NSA and other agencies must ensure the security of the Internet, not undermine it. The NSA should not be sabotaging encryption standards or breaking into company systems to collect information that would otherwise be protected by law. Finally, we need legislative codification of these reforms. These programs began before the current administration took office and could continue if Congress does not take action. Decisions about whether we have privacy in our communications and records need to be made in public and written into law. The administration and Congress can and should work together to ensure that our spying laws return to a system based on suspicion, so that innocent Internet and phone users are not swept into vast government databases. Given the pressures of an election year, it should be a priority for the administration and Congress to pass legislation quickly. Dragnet spying doesn't make us safer, and it needlessly violates Americans' privacy rights. The tide has turned. The president must now heed the growing consensus against mass spying and act decisively to end it.	ACLU to Obama: Promote Transparency and Ensure the Security of the Internet
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/01/bridgeghazi_chris_christie_and_corruption_american_politics_should_be_dirtier.html	"Chris Christie, who punches when he should shove and shoves when he should wink, has had a long and successful career as a bully. The Fort Lee bridge scandal has almost certainly brought that to an end. ""Embarrassed and humiliated,"" Christie is now pretending that he never coerces, punishes, or leans his heavy hand on fellow politicians. And post-Bridgeghazi, he will actually have to govern that way. Christie can't be Christie anymore. That's because, after you scrape away the thick layers of Democratic gloating, conservative schadenfreude, and media glee, there is general agreement that what the New Jersey governor and his people have been doing is deplorable. He's already apologized abjectly for the George Washington Bridge lane closures. New reports suggest Christie and his top officials also canceled meetings with Jersey City's Democratic Mayor Steve Fulop after Fulop declined to endorse Christie's re-election bid this summer. Good-government types have greeted each new revelation with a sigh of satisfied disappointment. Oh, the gambling that goes on here in Casablanca! Having governed by intimidation, punishment, cronyism, patronage, and legal forms of corruption, Christie is now unmanned. He has renounced Satan and all his works, given up his ability to kneecap and to bribe. And that's a shame, because Chris Christieism is not the main problem with American politics these days, or even a problem at all. American politics is a broken horror, particularly at the national level, not because politicians are too dirty, but because they're not nearly dirty enough. Children need to eat dirt to develop immunological resistance that protects them from allergies and disease as they grow up. Something similar is true in politics: Minor forms of corruption--votes bought with earmarks, traded favors--create a political flexibility that keeps the entire system from collapsing in moments of crisis. But excessive hygiene is rampant in Washington. The controlling conservative wing of the Republican Party is addicted to principle. If politics is the art of compromise, we have a huge number of elected officials who are not politicians at all but rather zealots animated by ideology. This consistency, so admirable in a campaign ad, makes governing and legislation nearly impossible. A case in point is the House ban on earmarks, a proud achievement of the Boehner majority for the past four years. Grubby and inefficient, earmarks decorate the country with misplaced bridges and idiotic museums. But evidence suggests they also make political compromises possible. The less than 1 percent of federal spending that went to earmarks bought goodwill and dealmaking that lubricated Washington. Earmarks--a bribe, essentially--gave politicians cover to vote against their political interests, in support of someone else's agenda. Think of President Obama buying support for his stimulus with a $10 billion pet project for Arlen Specter, or LBJ's entire quid pro quo presidency. On the flip side: The earmark ban made it impossible for Democrats to buy enough votes to pass last year's gun bill. Democrats and Republicans rail about the corruption of Washington, about backroom deals and ""Chicago-style"" politics. But there are no backrooms anymore, just green rooms. And we should be so lucky to have Chicago-style politics in D.C. Instead we have a gritty political system, one without tools to do much of anything. And that's why Christieism seemed the cure, not the disease. Political machines made some American cities work (with an asterisk) for a century. The machine style still animates some cities and states, most visibly Rahm Emanuel's Chicago. The premise of Chris Christie's presidential campaign is that he would bring New Jersey-style politics to Washington. The generous interpretation of that: He has an ability to work with Democrats in New Jersey, so he would do the same in Washington. The reality: He has an ability to work with Democrats in New Jersey because he's willing to bribe, mug, and hug them to get what he wants, so wouldn't it be nice if he could do the same in Washington? Bridgeghazi is frustrating because it suggests Christie actually isn't an effective practitioner of kneecap politics. The closing of the George Washington Bridge lanes was so stupid, so heavy-handed, so public. They got caught! Christie and his people have given a bad name to a kind of politics that Americans should crave. In an excellent piece about Christie's failure, David Simon compares the New Jersey governor to former Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer. ""[Schaefer] might play every all-in-the-game political angle to reward friends and harm adversaries and take pride in the result. He would not, however, snarl some Maryland traffic purposely, endangering residents of his state, to achieve the most petty kind of payback. He wouldn't purposely set his state's performance back for a petty and vicious comeuppance."" Some political systems, such as the incorruptible and efficient  Scandinavian ones, can thrive without ""dirty hands."" But ours can't. In a country as diverse, unequal, and divided as the United States, citizens disagree about how to build roads, levy taxes, and educate children, and so do the people they elect to represent them. Legalized bribery--a judgeship for my low-IQ college roommate in exchange for a vote for your dumb charter school plan--helps keep it all going (and legalized punishment: Vote for my dumb charter school plan, or we start investigating your roommate's ""business""). Petty corruption isn't necessarily in the public interest. Not every act of political thuggery is in the service of passing the Civil Rights Act. Christie, in particular, seems to have doled out punishment for political reasons, rather than in pursuit of major policy goals. But done right, corruption helps create a government that gets things done. Americans aspire to clean politics. But clean politics has given us a national government that doesn't work. We need to get a little bit grubbier."	The Lesson From the Christie Scandal: American Politics Should Be More Corrupt

In the December budget deal, the one that saved Christmas, $6 billion was the modest projected total for a small cut to the growth of military pensions. This was far, far punier than the entitlement reforms Washington used to talk about, but according to Rep. Paul Ryan, the House budget chairman, it represented ""real changes to these autopilot programs that are the real drivers of our debt."" The idea came pre-endorsed by Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson. And who didn't like those guys?"	Congress Has Rediscovered the Joys of Voter Pandering
9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/01/marco_rubio_and_paul_ryan_lead_a_republican_campaign_against_poverty.html	"Lyndon Baines Johnson was staring Marco Rubio in the face. It had been, as Rubio reminded his audience, 50 years since ""President Lyndon Johnson sought to address the plight of poverty by waging a war against it."" Rubio, who can't (yet) call a joint session of Congress to share his big ideas, was speaking in the Senate meeting room that once served as Johnson's office, long since restored to its Victorian beauty and host to weekly Republican luncheons. A tastefully small portrait of Johnson hung on the wall above and behind the cameras--i.e., right where Rubio had fixed his eyes. ""What I am proposing today is the most fundamental change to how the federal government fights poverty and encourages income mobility since President Johnson first conceived of the war on poverty 50 years ago,"" said Rubio. ""I am proposing that we turn Washington's anti-poverty programs--and the trillions spent on them--over to the states."" Fundamental, sure, but Rubio couldn't call it ""new."" In 1975, when the future senator was 4 years old, Ronald Reagan delivered a speech that called for a ""creative federalism"" to replace all anti-poverty programs, ""a systematic transfer of authority and resources to the states."" None of the conservative wonks in the small room seemed particularly startled by Rubio's idea--not National Affairs editor Yuval Levin, not American Enterprise Institute President Arthur Brooks, not columnist (and Jeopardy! winner) James Pethokoukis. The oldness of the idea was part of the sale. Rubio's speech came during a surge of Republican big-thinks on the subject timed to the anniversary of Johnson's ""War on Poverty."" Reporter Byron York, whose understanding of conservative and GOP strategy borders on the telepathic, called this surge ""a campaign launched without the party's internal agreement on a specific anti-poverty agenda,"" a distraction from the quest to win middle-class votes. Yet Eric Cantor went ahead and talked up school vouchers. Paul Ryan continued an anti-poverty speaking tour that has yet to delve into policy or cost. Even the Republican Study Committee, the conservative group whose membership helped shut down the government, held a brief declasse-centric event on the LBJ anniversary. True, the House GOP ended the week by returning to the safe harbor of anti-Obamacare legislation, but for a few days Republicans really did want to talk about poverty. The media noticed. Coverage of the poverty speeches fit into two categories--mile-high analysis of the electoral politics, and chin-wagging about what the Republicans were actually proposing. ""A lot of voters felt that President Obama cared more about them than Mitt Romney did,"" sighed Maine Sen. Susan Collins (who missed the party by not giving a major speech this week) to the New York Times. That was true. According to the 2012 exit poll, voters said that Barack Obama was more ""in touch with people like them"" by a 10-point margin, and when asked which candidate ""cares about people,"" 81 percent chose the guy who didn't work at Bain Capital. Only 71 percent of Hispanic voters--you know, the last constituency that Rubio and Ryan told Republicans they needed to win over--voted for Obama. Never mind that, because hearing Republicans talk about poverty as a problem the government can fix by distributing money is much more radical than anything they've said about immigration. From the start of the stimulus through the 2012 election--through the age of austerity politics, basically--the party was vehemently against redistribution. Before he lost, when they still had to defend him, Republicans agreed with Mitt Romney about ""the 47 percent."" Pay no net income taxes and you'll become a moocher, as sure as a caterpillar turns into a moth. Jon Huntsman, supposedly the ""moderate"" Republican candidate (it helped if you never read his tax plan), worried that ""we don't have enough people paying taxes in this country."" Who did he credit with that insight? A promising freshman senator named Marco Rubio. I tried to attend all of this week's poverty-o-ramas in person, and I heard a completely different melody coming from the GOP. Most of the time. Excising Cantor, who was really continuing a series of small-scale reform speeches that he's given since 2012, here's what everyone said and how new it was. Marco Rubio
 Setting: See above. Pronouncement that the War on Poverty failed: Check. Rubio tut-tutted LBJ for ""the belief still held by liberals to this very day: that government spending is the central answer to healing the wounds of poverty."" Every Republican poverty speech needs to insist that the spending failed and was doomed to fail. That's how you can make a speech about poverty while urging states to avoid Medicaid expansion. Battle scars from seeing poverty up close: ""I am but a generation removed from poverty and despair. Where would I be today if there had never been an America?"" Ideas: Several. Rubio borrowed heavily from, and eventually cited (after a reporter asked him for specifics), a 2013 National Review essay by Bain Capital/Romney 2012 veteran Oren Cass. The idea of a ""Flex Fund,"" with all current anti-poverty programs block-granted to the states, came most recently from Cass. So, in a way, did Rubio's call ""to replace the earned income tax credit with a federal wage enhancement for qualifying low-wage jobs."" Expanding that credit, guaranteeing a certain level of income, is an idea easily denounced as socialism until you recall that Milton Friedman came up with it. As Cass argued, if federal nutrition programs were ended but the money were distributed as a tax credit, ""there would be no change in anti-poverty spending, but for working households a greater share would come in the form of a subsidized wage instead of an in-kind benefit."" Details: There's your problem. That one specific question for Rubio, about what might be included in the Flex Fund, got him to say that it was being ""worked out."" Rubio referred to a war on poverty that had spent ""trillions,"" which implies some spending--Medicare, say--that wouldn't make it into the fund. A revenue version of the tax credit would, as Jonathan Cohn discovered, probably reward poor, childless people, though Rubio called marriage ""the greatest tool to lift children and families from poverty."" Legislation is not yet ready. Paul Ryan
 Setting: A 15-minute interview at the Newseum in downtown Washington, conducted by Brian Williams. The cheerful host wasted nearly 1/15 of this time discussing football. Pronouncement that the War on Poverty failed: ""I would give us a failing grade. It has failed."" Battle scars from seeing poverty up close: Several anecdotes about Anacostia, the poor D.C. neighborhoods ""just seven miles from here,"" where Ryan had met a heroic bishop who cleaned up a dangerous housing project. Ideas: Housing vouchers. ""We've got to stop quarantining the poor,"" explained Ryan; Republicans should try to move people closer to where they work. Ryan's version of the Flex Fund was borrowed from the U.K.'s ruling coalition government. ""They have a new idea called the universal credit,"" he said. ""They took six means programs, consolidated it into a credit."" That is a new idea, but its arrival has been flummoxed by design delays and cost overruns, something Republicans are decidedly against when it comes to big new government programs. Details: Still to come. Ryan, whose anti-poverty ruminations have been profiled by reporters for at least the last six months, is expected to come out with legislation by March or so. House Conservatives
 Setting: One of the Capitol's TV studios. Not particularly evocative, but pretty nice carpeting. Pronouncement that the War on Poverty failed: Florida Rep. Steve Southerland, the quarterback of the campaign to tie food stamps to greater work requirements, stated that there were ""more Americans in poverty"" than there had been in 1963. When a reporter pointed out that there are about 120 million more Americans now, and that the percentage of people in poverty is lower, Southerland explained: ""I do not agree with that data."" Battle scars from seeing poverty up close: Oklahoma Rep. James Lankford intoned that, ""My grandmother did not dream that one day her children would grow up to stand in line to collect a check."" Ideas: Basically, a collection of what Republicans have done already. ""We need innovative solutions,"" explained Indiana Rep. Marlin Stutzman, ""like when Republicans separated the farm bill from the food stamps bill for the first time in 40 years."" Details: Again, see those bills they've already been trying to pass; see, too, what private charity can do when not hidebound by bureaucracy. The Republican Study Committee has actually been on the poverty-campaign trail since September 2012, when it launched an ""initiative"" to generate ideas. That launch included community organizers like Bob Woodson, founder of the Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, who'd been optimistic about what a little fresh thinking might do. Woodson was back on the Hill this week, among the audience at Rubio's speech, hoping that this time might be different."	Wait, Are the Republicans Really Saying That Government Spending Can Fight Poverty?
10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/01/robert_gates_memoir_duty_how_washington_ideologues_misunderstand_the_former.html	"Based on the early excerpts of former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates' memoir, Duty, it is obvious that he has written a nuanced account of Washington in the Bush and Obama years. That complexity and subtlety comes through when, for example, he says that he never saw George W. Bush make a war decision based on politics but then adds, ""although, in fairness, his sharp-elbowed political gurus were nearly all gone by the time I arrived."" He's not so much suggesting a different truth: He simply wants readers to know precisely how far he is going with his claim. ""Too many ideologues call for U.S. force as their first option,"" he writes. Oh, he must be talking about Bush and the neoconservatives, you might think. No, he's talking both about those on the left who argue for the ""responsibility to protect"" civilians in Libya, Syria, and Sudan and about those on the right who are ready to light up Iran. But the early response to the book has none of the subtlety of Gates' actual prose. There are enough damning quotes in Duty to serve any purpose, and those quotes have been weaponized and they're detonating all over Twitter and in slapdash reviews, locking in narratives for both the right and the left. So, if you don't like President Obama, you quote Gates' claims that he engaged in ""wishful thinking"" and lacked nerve when things went bad and that his White House micromanaged on a level with the Nixon White House. Or you can choose to note that he says the Obama White House was ""determined to take credit for every good thing that happened while giving none to the career folks in the trenches who had actually done the work."" (Ouch.) If you do like Obama, you can cite any of the several times Gates calls him ""bold,"" the blanket statement about his Afghanistan policies (that his every decision was right and that he frequently made decisions ""opposed by his political advisers or that would be unpopular with his fellow Democrats""), and Gates' characterization of Obama's call to go after Bin Laden as ""one of the most courageous decisions I had ever witnessed in the White House."" If you like George Bush, you cite Gates' appreciation for his sense of mission, respect for the military, and genius in turning around the Iraq War. If you don't like him, then you can highlight that Gates affirms that the invasion of Iraq ""significantly compounded"" the problems in Afghanistan, implies that Bush took his eye off the ball in the war on terrorism, and says that Bush's Afghanistan strategy was ""embarrassingly ambitious"" and ""historically naive."" Those using Gates' words to bash Obama or Bush are acting out the precise pantomime that Gates hates so much and that appears to be the central target of this book. His chief worry is that ""moderation is equated with lacking principles and compromise with 'selling out.' Our political system has rarely been so polarized and unable to execute even the basic functions of government."" The ideologues tweezing snippets out of the reviews of Gates' book for their never-ending slap fight are using the secretary's authority to make their points. But if you're going to use his authority in that instance, then you have to sit still for his larger verdict, which is that you and the zero-sum fracas you're engaged in are what is ruining our government. And Gates' message is not just that ideology and Washington grandstanding are clotting rational thought and ruining politics but that the stakes of this stupidity are measured in lives and constantly grinding sorrow. At the end of the excerpt in the Wall Street Journal, Gates talks about waking in the middle of the night haunted by wounded soldiers in military hospitals. ""I would put myself in his hospital room, and I would hold him to my chest to comfort him. At home, in the night, I silently wept for him."" Whether Gates is right or wrong in the conclusions he reaches, his book is an attempt to argue for measured thinking and to put that measured thinking on display. This is a trait that we should encourage and try to learn from because our other choice is the fracas. The circus around the launch of Duty reminds me of Upton Sinclair's famous line about The Jungle: ""I aimed at the public's heart and by accident I hit it in the stomach."" This presents a challenge for Gates when he officially starts his book rollout next week. When he is asked about the fracas, the controversies, the Twitter battles over Duty, he should say, ""That is not what I meant at all; that is not it, at all."""	How This Town Grossly Misunderstands Robert Gates' New Memoir
11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/01/obamacare_and_unemployment_benefits_the_gop_strategy_for_winning_the_senate.html	"The Democrats were shocked. They didn't expect a bill reviving unemployment benefits for three months to get a quick vote in the Senate. On Monday and Tuesday they prepared to condemn the Republicans for heartlessly filibustering it, gathering Real Americans at the White House to condemn the vote. This was, as Politico put it, the fight Obama wanted. And this was why Republicans didn't give it to him and Senate Democrats. On Monday, North Carolina Democrat Sen. Kay Hagan, up for re-election in 2014, had stood beside her state's Democratic legislators to condemn Raleigh Republicans for letting ""the people of our state suffer."" North Carolina's triumphant GOP, which took over the state in 2013, ended extended unemployment benefits six months ago. The GOP knew, and its 2014 candidates knew, that Hagan was stronger in the polls when voters were angry at the legislature and weaker in the polls when voters got angry at the Affordable Care Act. Public Policy Polling, the North Carolina-based firm that Republicans typically accuse of liberal bias, found a 10-point surge in Hagan's negative numbers since the rollout of healthcare.gov. So the GOP decided: Why fight about unemployment insurance when you can remind voters that Obamacare exists, and Hagan voted for it? Get ready for 11 months of this, across the Senate races and on Republicans' terms. The party needs to net six seats to topple Harry Reid. Most of 2014's key Senate races, the battles to defeat Democrats or replace Democratic incumbents, are happening in states where Republicans ""opted out"" of Obamacare. These states didn't set up health care exchanges, which are working fairly well (unless you happen to live in Oregon). These states didn't buy into the Medicaid expansion. In North Carolina, Louisiana, Alaska, New Hampshire, and Virginia--all states that rejected Obamacare exchanges--Democrats are running for re-election. (New Hampshire and Virginia are seen as much safer for the party, but the emboldened GOP is trying to recruit former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown and former RNC Chairman Ed Gillespie to make races.) In Montana and South Dakota--also Obamacare refusenik states--Democrats are struggling to hold open seats. For Republicans, what's the cost of making the 2014 races all about Obamacare? They don't see one. Republicans are on the repeal-Obamacare team, and they'll do anything to stop the nation sliding into euro-socialism. They're never subtle about undermining the law. Why would they be? ""I tried to rip out Obamacare by the roots"" is an applause line from the Chamber of Commerce breakfast to the Tea Party Patriots candidate forum. ""It's the broader issue,"" said Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran, who's chairing the National Republican Senatorial Committee for this cycle. ""It's not Medicaid expansion. It's the damaging consequences of the Affordable Care Act. Unless you're a provider, to an average citizen in a state, it's not about whether a state has created an exchange or expanded Medicaid. It's: Oh, my gosh, I can't keep the policy I had! I can't get to the same doctor I've been going to for years. Those issues are much more significant than the details of what a state has or hasn't done."" But they're not insignificant. Months ago, before the government shutdown birthed the current punt-on-everything, talk-about-Obamacare theory, conservatives worried (and Demorats sort of hoped) that voters would be bought off by ""free stuff"" in the form of Medicaid and subsidies.  ""On Jan. 1, the exchanges kick in and the subsidies kick in,"" said Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in July 2013. ""Once those kick in, it's going to prove almost impossible to undo Obamacare."" If Democrats lose all the open seats in ""red states""--Montana, South Dakota, West Virginia--they'll need North Carolina's Hagan, Alaska Sen. Mark Begich, and Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu to manage to hold on to their seats while still defending the ACA, and blaming Republicans for its shortfalls. Landrieu, the most experienced politician in this group, is happy to try. ""I've been very focused on this group of anywhere from 200,000 to 300,000 people in Louisiana who work--they may even work full time--but they earn too much money to be on the current tight criteria for Medicaid,"" she said on Tuesday. ""Our governor, despite the overwhelming evidence from conservative and liberal think tanks--the overwhelming evidence--that it is in the state's economic interest to expand Medicaid, and expand health care, to middle-class families, with the $16 billion that's available, has said no. It's having a terrible economic impact on the state as a whole, and as importantly, to these 200,000, 300,000 people who are working, it leaves them in the cold because they can't get on the exchange and they can't get on Medicaid."" Republicans don't believe the line will work on voters. Democrats say it already has. Republicans insist that voter anger about Obamacare nearly elected Ken Cuccinelli in last year's Virginia gubernatorial campaign. Geoff Garin, the pollster for Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe, insists that the Democrats won the issue. McAuliffe's getting ready to take the oath and govern Virginia for four years, so Garin might not be wrong. ""Medicaid expansion was front and center in our messaging to our GOTV targets, and we made a lot of the fact that McAuliffe wanted to accept federal funding to provide affordable coverage to 400,000 Virginians while Cuccinelli stridently opposed it,"" said Garin. ""In our post-election polling of our targets, we saw that this issue created a lot of motivation for drop off voters, particularly African-Americans, to turn out, and I expect it can play the same role in mobilization efforts in North Carolina, Louisiana, and Arkansas."" I asked Landrieu if this made sense to her. Were Louisiana voters going to blame Democrats for any faults with the health care law? Would they see the Medicaid gap as just another float in the liberals' parade of horribles? ""No,"" said Landrieu. ""Based on the governor's low poll numbers, they see exactly who's at fault."" It's true, Landrieu is polling better than Gov. Bobby Jindal. The most recent statewide Louisiana numbers put her approval at 47 percent and his at 42 percent. But since the rollout of the exchanges, since he reiterated that he'd never expand Medicaid, he was up 4 points and she was down 10."	The Entire Republican Strategy for Winning the Senate in 2014, Boiled Down to One Word
12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/01/brian_schweitzer_interview_the_former_montana_governor_is_the_most_likely.html	"The last time he appeared on a ballot, then-Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer filmed a TV ad that consisted entirely of him shooting clay pigeons. ""When Washington, D.C., wanted to track Americans with federal ID cards,"" rumbled a narrator, ""our governor said no. He stopped out-of-state interests from closing Montana's rivers and streams to public access. Oh, and he's endorsed by the NRA."" Schweitzer turned to the camera. ""It helps to tape the federal ID card onto the clay pigeon,"" he said with a chuckle. ""Gives me motivation."" Democrats inside and outside of Montana loved Schweitzer. The liberal ""netroots"" held him up as a model for other candidates, a bolo-tied Neo who'd cracked the culture-war code. Schweitzer gave a rolling, mocking speech at the 2008 Democratic National Convention that won more praise than the official keynote address. He won re-election with a vote margin that he can recite from memory. ""Sixty-five-point-six percent,"" says Schweitzer, talking on the phone this weekend before heading to Washington to appear on ABC's This Week. ""Sen. Jon Tester won re-election [in 2012] and didn't get 50 percent of the vote. I didn't have that problem. ... If I wanted to be in the Senate, there was a pretty clear path to get there."" But Schweitzer isn't running for Senate. Democrats had wanted the popular former governor to replace retiring Sen. Max Baucus. Schweitzer's lucky career in politics began when he surged from obscurity to nearly win a Senate seat in Montana, way back in 2000. Since then, sure, he'd never mentioned Washington without a zinger about how dreadful it would be to live there, but Democrats were shocked when he turned down an easy-looking race to replace his longtime intraparty rival, Baucus. ""I'll be honest with you, I was a little naive in 2000,"" says Schweitzer. ""The system's changed since then. It's gotten a lot worse. I found that being a member of Congress means your only job is to get re-elected. History will judge you by how many times you get re-elected, and you get re-elected by raising money. You raise it from insurance, from pharmaceutical, from big energy, and from the military-industrial complex."" Naturally, Schweitzer's started talking about a campaign that would be tenfold as expensive as a Senate race. He's been visiting Iowa and promising to visit all 99 counties. (It's on his ""bucket list."") The Venn diagram of people who visit all 99 Iowa counties and people who run for president is basically a solid circle. Schweitzer's only just been added to presidential polls, where he comes in between zero and 2 percent. He talks about these numbers the way a presidential candidate always does. ""The Republicans tend to choose the candidate who came in second place in the last election, and Democrats tend to move on,"" he says. ""Ask President Ed Muskie how it worked out to be the front-runner. Ask President Howard Dean how it worked out."" Here's an edited version of the rest of our conversation. David Weigel: You start off every morning at 4 a.m. or so, reading national news, so I assume you read the New York Times editorial calling for clemency for Edward Snowden. Do you agree with the Times? Would you grant clemency? Brian Schweitzer: If Edward Snowden is a criminal, then so are a lot of people that are working within the CIA and the NSA who have been spying illegally on American citizens. They ought to grant Snowden clemency. Now, let me say this: Shame on us if we had a person working for a private contractor, without a high school diploma, who was in possession of our most delicate secrets. We look like Keystone Kops! But I don't have any problem with the NSA and their mission of collecting information on foreign leaders. They spy on us; we spy on them. I've got a real big problem with American neighbors spying on American neighbors. DW: Given how much you campaigned against REAL ID cards, I feel like we know where you stand on the ethics of surveillance and information collection. But what is it about the domestic spying programs that worries you, specifically? BS: It's enough that they have illegally, knowingly violated federal law, violated constitutional rights, and are effectively spying on law-abiding American citizens. Look, I do not trust politicians. The only thing a politician cares about is getting re-elected. If they can collect information on their political opponents and use it in various ways to embarrass them, they'll do it. If you don't believe they'd do that if they got the chance, then you, my friend, are naive. DW: Last month, when you went to Iowa and talked to Democrats, you criticized the Democrats who voted for the Iraq War. There's one Democrat in particular who really fits that profile right now [Hillary Clinton], but putting that aside: Are you any more satisfied with the policies of the last six months or so? The Iran deal? The deal that prevented airstrikes on Syria? BS: The Iranian deal makes sense. We linked up with the Saudis before and after World War II. Look, unlike virtually every member of Congress, I have a pretty good firsthand knowledge of the Middle East. The day after I got out of graduate school, after I defended my thesis, I went straight to Libya. I was there for a year; I was in Saudi Arabia for seven. I learned to speak Arabic. I can explain to you, in a way that almost no one else in the country can, the difference between a Sunni and a Shia. I can explain to you who and what the Wahhabis are in Saudi Arabia. I can talk to you about why we, the United States, initially got involved with the Saudi royal family, what we got out of the deal. I can explain to you why we knew Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. We knew, because we supplied chemical weapons to him so he could poison the Iranians. The Iranians are Persian, not Arab; they haven't got along for several thousand years. So we've had a bad history with Iran because of what we did in 1953, replacing an elected official with a dictator. If we can build a relationship that's a little more even-handed, if we can get them to back away from their nuclear ambition--let's face it, their neighbors don't even like that--if we were to step up and said we're no longer just going to take the Saudis' position all the time, you don't have to worry about us attacking you from Afghanistan or Iraq, if you agree to back away from your nuclear ambitions, we'll be neutral. DW: Does that explain why you always opposed getting into the war in Iraq? BS: What did we do in Iraq? We up and attack Iraq, create a vacuum, and allow Iran to broaden their shoulders. Of course, in Afghanistan it made sense for the first six months. That's where Osama Bin Laden, who, while I lived in Saudi Arabia, was called the Mujahedeen, was. The Americans and Saudis were pouring money his way, giving him arms, because he was fighting the Russians. After the Russians left, we started calling them al-Qaida. He didn't like us, but he didn't like the Russians. So we went in to stamp out al-Qaida. Six months after we arrived in Afghanistan, al-Qaida was gone. They'd left. So now, in the longest war in the history of the United States, we're fighting someone called the Taliban--never attacked us, never tried to attack us. They live in the Stone Age. I've been there. Even if they wanted to attack us, they wouldn't find a way. DW: There isn't any danger in letting the Taliban take over the country? BS: Take over what? This is the biggest joke in the whole world. What you do when you go to war is destroy enough of the other side's infrastructure, and demonstrate you can destroy even more, that they decide they can't keep it up or they'll have nothing left. But to the extent that people in Afghanistan have anything, it's been built by us. They live in stone houses. They have no infrastructure. What the Russians put there and what we've put there are the only things of any value. Oh, apart from the poppies they're growing. DW: I suppose the question is whether we should worry about blowback, years later, after leaving the country. BS: If it all goes to hell in a handbasket, that's fine. That happened after Alexander the Great left; that happened after the Russians left. Who cares? They live in the Stone Age. If you ask generals whether we should stay in a war a little longer, that's like asking a barber whether you need a haircut. DW: You mentioned poppies, which is as good of a segue I can think of to what's happening in Colorado. Do you think that state's made the right move in legalizing marijuana? Should the rest of the country go that way? BS: Well, here's what I can say. Each society has to make choices about what's against the law. You have a large percentage of the population that's already using this. The war on drugs is another war that appears to have been lost. This experiment with prohibition of marijuana doesn't seem have to been working. Colorado might have it more right than the rest of us. DW: One reason I ask is that when you ran in 2004, when you won the governor's race, there were gay marriage and marijuana issues on the ballot, and Republicans thought they'd set ""family values"" traps for you. BS: Oh, yeah, name these Republicans. The ones cheating on their third wives while they're talking about traditional family values? Those ones? DW: Do you think the Affordable Care Act can be made to work? BS: I will give you not just how this thing should have been written, but what it will get to be, because what we have right now will not work. No. 1: You pass national health insurance laws that say you can't discriminate against women, charge them higher premiums than men of the same age, you can't discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions, you can't have annual caps. Then you allow insurance companies to compete wherever they want, in any state. Boom. The second thing is, you say to every citizen in the United States, now you have the option to buy into Medicare. We just need to act like capitalists, not socialists. We need to negotiate to buy medicine. Now, what's interesting is that the detractors hear that and say--this is like socialized medicine. No! Are you kidding me? France, the United Kingdom: They negotiate like capitalists to buy their medicine. The United States? We say to the pharmaceutical companies, how much would you like this for? We continue to pay them three times what they sell the same medicines for all over the world. Right after the bill was passed, big pharma was running ads for all the Democrats who voted for this thing. Even in Montana. What'd they get out of it? They now have a lot more money. DW: Are you any happier with what the administration's focusing on this year? One example: The new push to raise the minimum wage. BS: It's a good idea, and we raised the minimum wage in Montana. You just can't tell when a politician says something whether he's doing it for you or whether he's using it as a wedge issue to get somewhere else. If you're talking about inequality, you really need to start by talking about quality education. If we don't have full-day kindergarten like we do in Montana, then we have a huge proportion of our population that can never catch up. If in fact you're from the lower middle class, you'll be so in hock that you'll be 20 years out of college before you pay those loans. DW: Between the Department of Education and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, there's actually been some work done on student loan reform. I mean, they're not where they want to be, but it's one of the crusades that progressives in Washington seem more optimistic about. BS: It's only been five years of this administration, so maybe by the eighth year they'll get something done. Congratulations. Thanks for playing. DW: Did you read anything into the Clintons showing up for Bill de Blasio's inauguration in New York? BS: Oh, they've got a home there, and she was a senator from New York. De Blasio helped her and her campaign. Yeah, I've read articles about how Hillary's sending a message to the left, how she's saying, ""I'm not the Goldman Sachs candidate."" Well, how about this? How about they're being nice to a friend? DW: Is she trying to prove she's not a corporatist, as you've called her? BS: No, no, I called the president a corporatist. He seems to be OK transferring taxpayer dollars into pharmaceutical companies' pockets. He's certainly OK transferring them into the military-industrial complex's pockets. He's not unlike Woodrow Wilson, who was the last really big Democratic corporatist. DW: Where do you think he actually ranks in the last 50-100 years of Democratic presidents? BS: In part what a president is able to do is elevate, through rhetoric, issues that need to be elevated. I'd give him an A in that area. His ability to communicate, to deliver the message about the values that set us aside as Americans, is very good. I just don't think his administration has been very good at doing things, about organizing things. It's not just about the rollout of the Affordable Care Act. As governor I had four years to work with the Bush administration and four years to work with the Obama administration, and they're just not good at getting things done. DW: And how did Bill Clinton rank? Do you have any worries about the economic team than ran the place at the end of the '90s, for example--about them coming back? BS: Clinton had a very good run. It was eight years of peace and prosperity. But do you recall what the music was, blaring, after they were elected? DW: It was ""Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow."" BS: Right. Fleetwood Mac, ""Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow."" So what do we play next time? The Beatles, ""Yesterday""? In England, a baby's born and they know he'll grow up to be king someday. We're not England. We're America."	An Interview With the Democrat Most Likely to Challenge Hillary Clinton in 2016
13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/12/darrell_issa_investigates_obama_administration_benghazi_irs_sequester.html	"""Has this been the worst year of your presidency?"" That was how the Associated Press opened up President Obama's final press conference of 2013. Not the most original question, but scabrous enough, especially when the same reporter followed up by telling the president, ""Your credibility has taken a hit."" This was the year that trust in the president tumbled to 50 percent, and sometimes below. Republicans had been wondering when their fellow Americans would get there. So it must be frustrating to his opponents that Obama's mistakes were all self-made. He was the one who said, ""If you like your plan, you can keep it."" He let the National Security Agency run without a leash. Republican investigators never managed to nail him, by which I mean Rep. Darrell Issa never found the scandal that could bring down the president. Did he try? Did he ever. In his second term leading the House Oversight and Government Affairs committee, Issa made lunges at the reports of IRS bias in tax exemption forms, at the Benghazi attacks of 9/11/12, and at anything else that looked promising. Was the nominee for secretary of labor holding out on the emails Issa wanted to subpoena? Best to fire off a letter asking for them, and publicize the big-government intransigence. To comb over Issa's requests in 2013 is to read an dark and apparently alternate history of the Obama administration, one in which the president should have been impeached by now. Many thanks to Slate's Emma Roller for shaping and researching this recap: Sequestergate. In March and April, when the mandatory spending machete came down and federal agencies started cutting back, Republicans questioned whether the White House wanted the pain to be intensified. Issa took those concerns and threw them at the FAA, asking whether the threat of airline delays was manufactured. ""Questions have been raised about whether the FAA is properly applying the budget reductions required by sequestration."" Solving the mystery would require ""all documents and communications between or among employees, agents, or contractors of DOT or FAA and employees, agents, or contractors of the Executive Office of the President referring or relating"" to sequestration. How'd it end? Congress ended up plussing funding for air travel, pre-empting the crisis. No proof has surfaced--yet--to prove that federal agencies were ordered to make sequestration (or the shutdown) especially hurtful. Benghazigate I: Hillarygate. Issa investigated the response to the attacks in Benghazi all year, but--for want of a better cliche--the former secretary of state was obviously the white whale of the investigation. In April, Issa and Republicans issued an alternative Benghazi report (the State Department had written its own earlier) that claimed Clinton had seen cables from Libya that should have tipped her off to the danger--one ""signed"" by her! ""The secretary of state was just wrong,"" said Issa on Fox News. ""She said she did not participate in this and yet, only a few months before the attack, she outright denied security in her signature in a cable."" The problem: The automatic ""signature"" wasn't actually proof that she'd seen the cable. How'd it end? Clinton is still a possible candidate for president in 2016. IRSgate. This was going to be the one. Tea Party groups had complained to Republicans about some real static when they tried to apply for tax exemptions. Issa asked the agency's inspector general to look into the charges--the ones that hit conservatives. The report came back positive. Was the White House involved? It had to be, right? ""Like so many things that are wrongdoing, it can be a local event in the wrongdoing, overzealous IRS individuals, people who just start down a path of one, then 10, then 100 of these, if you will, Tea Party groups,"" Issa said on Fox. (He is a frequent guest on Fox, if that wasn't clear.) ""At some point people saw it, they became aware of it and it continued."" For much of the summer, Issa sent requests for more information from the IRS and the White House. His team interviewed witnesses. When President Obama wasn't implicated, Issa suggested that the agency had done this ""on his behalf."" When a CNN interviewer challenged that, Issa said, ""I've never said it came out of the office of the president or his campaign."" Later, Fox (again!) reported that Issa had finally grabbed evidence tracing the scandal ""all the way up into the White House."" The fact that the White House counsel had learned of the ""targeting"" from the IRS's Rules and Agreements office had actually been reported by the IG two months earlier. How'd it end? Lois Lerner, the IRS official blamed for the ""targeting,"" announced a convenient retirement in September. Republicans started asking whether FEC staff and IRS staff had been in contact, illegally, about the status of big conservative 501(c)3s. Benghazi II. In mid-May, Issa appeared to get fresh breaks in the investigation--new witnesses, new memos. The evidence was mounting, he told everyone, that the administration had covered up details from the period around the attack, and done so in front of Congress. ""We've got to have real-time, over-the-shoulder ability to see what we are being told,"" Issa told Fox's Sean Hannity in May. ""You know, ultimately they have made a claim. The administration has made a claim that for classified reasons they change the story. We believe right now that may be the biggest lie of all, and we intend on making the president come clean as to, quote, 'What the classified reasons are that would justify lying to the American people.' "" ""Any crime?"" asked Hannity, eagerly. ""Lying to Congress is a crime,"" said Issa. On May 10, ABC News published an exclusive report based on some of that new evidence--the talking points used by the administration after the attack, the ones that speculated that attackers had spontaneously risen up because an anti-Islam video made them so agitated, had been edited ""with extensive input from the State Department."" This, it turned out, was not quite true. ABC's report was based on descriptions made by Hill sources (given anonymity despite their incompetence), not on a memo that had far less editing from the White House or State Department. How'd it end? It hasn't. The heat has decreased since the error 60 Minutes made in its Benghazi report, when it gave half the story's screen time to a contractor who'd told superiors that he was never there but told a book publisher otherwise. Some Benghazi-watchers, including John McCain, think that the contractor was smeared. And Issa has subpoenaed the State Department for more documents. You can't indict if you don't try."	Darrell Issa Has Hounded the Obama Administration All Year. He's Got Nothing.
14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/12/libertarian_congressman_justin_amash_critic_of_nsa_immigration_budget_deal.html	"Justin Amash kicked off 2013 with an act of pointless, doomed rebellion. The congressman from Michigan, a Republican first elected in 2010, had just been removed from the budget committee, a long-delayed comeuppance for his opposition to the Paul Ryan budget. (Like many libertarians, he didn't think it went far enough.) He talked freely to reporters about the snub. After the new Congress was sworn in, Amash joined a crew of conservatives to vote against John Boehner for Speaker of the House. Amash was famous--and among establishment Republicans, notorious. ""Even I'm sick of seeing myself in the paper,"" he told a reporter. Not that sick, though. By the summer, Amash had normalized relations with his leadership and won a vote on an amendment to defund the NSA's domestic surveillance. When the amendment nearly passed, it altered the way official Washington discussed the NSA, changing the story from senators vs. Snowden to an actual controversy that ran through party lines. Three months later, the 33-year old congressman drew a wealthy and establishment-friendly Republican primary challenger. This was covered as a problem for the Tea Party, but it seemed awfully selective. Of all the ""unreasonable"" Republicans to go after, the one sweating a challenge was the libertarian who explained his votes on Facebook. I talked to Amash about the year that was and how he expects 2014 to play out. David Weigel: Your biggest legislative coup this year was a loss--the NSA amendment that went down narrowly. You're bringing it up again in 2014. Why would it go differently next time? Justin Amash: Well, things are going great. The recent court ruling, and the recent push by many of the tech companies puts things firmly on our side going forward. Actually, I've heard from many people about their votes next time, and one of the more prominent members of Congress who's changed his mind on this is Chairman [of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Darrell] Issa. As he's learned more about it, he's come to the conclusion that the NSA has to reform the way it operates. DW: How did this week's NSA decision move the votes? JA: What I took out of the court ruling was that it emphasized a lot of the points that I've been making over the past several months--that in the modern era, if the third party doctrine is applied as it was applied in Smith v. Maryland and extended to modern technologies, the entire Fourth Amendment is wiped away. And the ruling made the very clear case that I've also been making, that Smith v. Maryland is not really on point. DW: It's not now or it never was? JA: It's not now. I don't think it was a very strong ruling at the time, but it's certainly not applicable to modern surveillance issues. I expect we'll have an opportunity to look at this over the next several months. The Judiciary Committee sounds like it really wants to move forward with legislation. It's pretty clear that most members of Congress are in the USA Freedom Act camp. DW: How much do you think this year's NSA leaks moved people on spying? Was this sort of skepticism endemic and it just needed an outlet, or is it new? JA: There's always been a fair level of mistrust in government. It's part of our nature, here, as Americans. And that's good. It's part of the reason why we started our constitutional republic. But it's been heightened in recent years, and part of the reason is that technology has really eroded the privacy of so many people. If the government has access to all of our data, we have no privacy anymore. DW: Have you changed the way you protect your data? Do you have a VPN or something? You do post a lot on Facebook, which isn't the most privacy-friendly space. JA: I take the steps I think are appropriate. DW: You were just telling constituents at a town hall meeting that the budget deal was lousy because it didn't ""compromise."" We're all covering it, in the media, as a compromise. So what did you mean? JA: I've always said I'm willing to consider anything provided that Democrats are willing to consider Social Security and Medicare. Come on, let's get together and put everything on the table, let's have a discussion, because we can't continue the way we're going. The budget deal didn't change that direction. It wasn't as if we were making small improvements. That's not what I voted against. DW: So, why did it happen, who do you blame? JA: There's just a reluctance to compromise. The deal is the product of two parties that are unwilling to compromise. One side says, we're unwilling to compromise on military spending; the other side says, we're unwilling to compromise on Social Security and Medicare. So the deal was to do nothing. DW: This feels like less than Republicans told themselves they would get when the year started. Not long ago, you had the president on the record to put Social Security cost of living adjustment in a deal. JA: I think that's true. Expectations have changed as time has gone on. In fact, we were assured that the sequester would not be changed unless we were able to get major reforms to entitlements. After the Budget Control Act passed in 2011, that was the assurance made to us. Before the vote on the BCA, I remember standing up in conference prior to that deal, and asking our leadership: What if two years from now you decide, or Congress decides, to undo the sequester without compensating with Social Security and Medicare reforms? And the leadership told me, for that to happen, Republicans would have to go along with it. Do you really think that's going to happen? DW: It was a rhetorical question? JA: Oh, they said to me, do you think that'll happen--as if there was no chance whatsoever that it could. DW: Did you speak up this time? JA: I could see the direction things were going. I took a more low-key role. DW: So, what do you want to be attached to the debt limit when it comes up again? JA: I'd like to see major reforms to the largest spending programs. That might include Obamacare, but it's also going to include Social Security and Medicare and military spending. DW: Paul Ryan came to your district this year to talk about immigration reform. We're done for 2013; immigration reform hasn't happened. Are you disappointed? JA: Yeah. You have to have immigration reform. It's disappointing, it's unfortunate. Part of the problem is the breakdown of trust between the White House and particularly Republicans in Congress, so that many Republicans who were supportive of reform have backed away because they no longer trust that the president will faithfully execute the laws. DW: Does that include you? JA: Well, I am more skeptical of the process now then I was several months ago. It'll take a lot of work to get to me the point where I could trust President Obama to enforce the laws we've passed. I'm concerned about that. This president certainly hasn't been shy in taking the law into his own hands when it doesn't comport with his views. So I'd like to see immigration reform but trust has to rebuilt between the sides, and it has to be immigration reform that is beneficial to Americans on the whole, beneficial to our country, provides adequate border security. DW: To what extent are your colleagues moving on from immigration reform because the Democrats are hurting now, and it doesn't seem like the GOP needs to win Hispanic votes in 2014? JA: It wouldn't surprise me if some people believed that, but if we're going to be a party that represents the entire country we have to be welcoming to people from all backgrounds. I think that means some reforms to our immigration system. DW: Washington and Colorado legalized marijuana this year and didn't collapse into dystopian nightmares. You've reintroduced a bill that would make the feds respect state laws on marijuana. Do you see that going somewhere in 2014? JA: Yeah, there's going to be more progress. People are beginning to see that an issue like this should be handled at the state and local level, and that the federal government should stick to subjects that are specified in the Constitution. DW: Are you surprised that this president is so strict on drug laws? We've seen photos of him as a teenager partying with the Choom Gang. We know he knows you can smoke pot and be a member of society. JA: Ha, well, I think things will change in the next few years pretty rapidly. DW: After this year's DOMA decision, do you think the GOP is basically done trying to restrict or ban gay marriage? JA: That was a positive development, because here's an area that's not enumerated in the Constitution and it's not an issue for the federal government to deal with. Whether you're straight or gay, marriage is not a federal issue. DW: Back to subjects that disappointed people this year. Why did the House finish up without passing a farm bill or unemployment insurance extensions? JA: Look, unemployment insurance has to be reformed. It can't go on for two years at a time. When we pass a farm bill we need some major reforms that end the large subsidies or phase them out, and the new bill--which hasn't passed yet--will do some of that. It'll eliminate some of the 1940s laws, but it adds new provisions that aren't very good for the economy. DW: Why can't Republicans bring themselves to say, OK, we're cutting food stamps--but we'll get rid of farm subsidies, because they're much less needed? JA: I've said this many times: It sends the wrong message when our legislation is cutting welfare for those that are in need while providing subsidies to people who are quite well off. DW: That's probably enough about disappointments. What was the best day you had in Congress this year? JA: Not striking Syria was a highlight. The NSA debate was the biggest highlight. Republicans and Democrats came together and stood on the House floor against their president and their leadership to make the case for protecting civil liberties. If you talk to people who were part of that debate, almost all of them will tell you it was a highlight of their entire time in Congress. DW: Speaking of that, I suppose you noticed that your primary opponent made fun of the idea that you, or any congressman, should explain his votes by determining whether they were in line with the Constitution. He said the courts were there to sort that out. JA: Yeah, I did. That's an embarrassing quote and nobody in the country can hope to be elected in a Republican primary if that's his or her view of the Constitution and Congress' role. DW: And despite that, you don't regret passing up the U.S. Senate race? JA: Oh, absolutely. Republicans have a great shot at winning the Senate seat but I'm happy being a representative from the third district. I like getting the chance to get back and see my family on a regular basis. If you're a senator you have a lot more territory to cover. No, I'm comfortable with the decision, and we'll come away with a big victory in the primary in August. DW: This despite the year starting with you being removed from the budget committee and voting against Boehner for speaker. JA: I feel like I have a good relationship with leadership. They understood where I can add to what they're doing and I think they'll utilize me more in the coming years. I think they recognize there are more and more Republicans who are leaning libertarian and that I represent a larger and larger chunk of the party. If we're going to work together, the Republican Party has to welcome everybody, it has to welcome young people, it has to welcome libertarians. DW: Finally, and most seriously, you've talked before about your enjoyment of video games. What was the best game of 2013? JA: I've played Bioshock Infinite a bit--that's my favorite game of the year. I love the way it alludes to some of our founding figures, and if you're a history or a politics wonk it adds to what a great game it is."	Critic of the Year: Libertarian Congressman Justin Amash
15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/01/barack_obama_s_sixth_state_of_the_union_speech_the_president_needs_to_get.html	"The State of the Union is a huge waste of time. You have read this column before and you know exactly what is coming in the following lines. This is how rote and desolate this annual exercise has become. The speech is not only predictable and boring, but the pieces denouncing the speech are predictable and boring. So a plea for creativity! As you watch tonight, think about the creativity the president shows in making his arguments, illustrating his points, or in doing something new and different with a rhetorical form that so imprisons the president that the walk to the House podium now resembles a perp walk. Why does creativity matter? Not to entertain, though that would be nice, but because one of the maladies of our current political system it is that we are stuck in old fights and old forms and old ways of thinking. Everyone plays to type and the cycle goes round and around. Even the prissy dismissiveness of those who refuse to attend the speech feels predictable. So if a president can break out of the speech even in some small way, it might at least show a little life, generate a spark of conversation that could elevate things a bit. I am making an appeal to magical thinking, but if a president can't be creative about this speech, there's no chance he'll be very creative about anything else. For presidents who want to show that they are in command of their office, they should grab the State of Union speech by the lapels and show it who's boss. Turn it upside down, shake it, and wake people up a little. Perhaps treating a speech like it is an actual human is a little daffy, but studies show there is literally no human on the planet who will pine for the old way. That a president can't take the minimal risk and make the speech a little different is a signal of how imprisoning the office has become. And each year the imprisonment gets deeper. (Tonight the president may be approaching solitary confinement.) This White House is pushing out advisers through every possible medium--seating charts on Pinterest! photos of the speechwriter's beard!--and carefully leaking details and engaging in all manner of frantic swirls of the blush wand to make the threadbare routine seem lively. This activity only highlights how exhausted the whole thing has become. (Unless, of course, this is a new kind of speech tonight, in which case: Bravo!) The answer is not to go back to delivering the speech in written form as it was until Woodrow Wilson revived the practice after 112 years. There is still something to be said for the public gathering as a whole for a moment to discuss the problems that face us. The answer is to do something that captures the sense of moment, as described in this newspaper story recounting Wilson's move to call the extraordinary joint session. ""Washington is amazed,"" it reads. What if a president did what the governor of Vermont did a few weeks ago and dedicated his speech to a single topic? In Vermont the issue was heroin use, but for President Obama the issue could be income inequality. He has said that it is the one thing he wants to tackle for the remainder of his presidency. He's straining to use every tool of the executive to combat it. One tool of the executive he could use (with his pen!) is to change the form of this speech. What if he were to say, ""There are a lot of important challenges that we face and for my views on them you can visit the White House website--which still works!--but tonight I want to talk about the one single issue that should be our guiding star."" That simple act of focus would be a 10-fold increase in creativity. At the very least it would cause the press to cover a single issue that the president says is important. Plus, to fill such a speech would require some story-telling and genuine acts of rhetoric to sustain his message from beginning to end. That would make it a speech worth listening to. Tonight, as you listen, count how many words or sentences are wasted. Not that they aren't' important in some way, but are they important enough to call the whole country to the dinner table? If they're not, maybe we should shelve the whole exercise until someone can come up with a form that injects a little whiff of the innovation, resilience, and creativity--qualities of the American spirit that are so often praised in the speech but rarely demonstrated by it."

Dinesh D'Souza, the conservative author and--more recently--filmmaker, was arrested on Thursday, suspected of laundering ""more than $10,000"" in donations to a failed Republican U.S. Senate candidate by promising to reimburse friends who donated above the legal limit. Molen, the producer of D'Souza's films, didn't find out all of the allegations until Sunday. D'Souza, who'd been under investigation for months, hadn't even talked to him. ""I'm taken aback by the whole thing,"" Molen told Newsmax interviewer Steve Malzberg on Monday. ""He's such a great American."" Malzberg moved on to a scarier story. Nineteen years ago, Molen had stood onstage to accept an Oscar for Schindler's List. Since then, he'd helped release D'Souza's 2016: Obama's America. Since then, the IRS had admitted that Tea Party groups got intense scrutiny when they asked for tax-exempt status. Since then, the IRS had turned the magnifying glass on Friends of Abe, a group for conservatives in the entertainment industry that had also been looking for tax exemption. The pattern sketched itself. ""Would it surprise you,"" asked Malzberg, ""if this investigation in the first place was politically motivated, based on the documentary?"" ""No, absolutely not,"" said Molen, struggling for his words. ""If you take a look at what the IRS has been alleged to do, there was an ongoing investigation--or there was, at least--they're stepping all over conservative groups ... we're talking about [D'Souza going] over whatever the maximum is, people borrowing money from him, and yet there's nothing about a dinner party in Hollywood that's $45,000 a plate going to someone."" ""Yeah, well, the laws are not fair all the time,"" said Malzberg. ""Did you guys worry when you made this documentary?"" ""I've never had the occasion to think that I had to fear my government,"" said Molen. ""I never had the thought that I had a reason to look over my shoulder. Until now."" The D'Souza indictment started as an odd political story. His laundered donations allegedly went to Wendy Long, the thankless 2012 Republican candidate against Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. Long raised less than $800,000 on her way to a 48-point landslide defeat, but D'Souza had known her from Dartmouth and helped her out in what his attorney has started to spin as ""an act of misguided friendship."" In the conservative media, it's become much more. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz ended his Sunday interview on Face the Nation by highlighting the D'Souza case. ""We've seen multiple filmmakers prosecuted and the government's gone after them,"" he said. ""Whether it's the poor fellow that did the film that the president blamed Benghazi and the terrorist attacks on--turns out that wasn't the reason for the attack but the administration went and put that poor fellow in jail on unrelated charges. Just this week it was broken that Dinesh D'Souza, who did a very big movie criticizing the president, is now being prosecuted by this administration. Can you image the reaction if the Bush administration had went, gone and prosecuted Michael Moore and Alec Baldwin and Sean Penn?"" CBS initially cut Cruz's theory out of the interview. The senator's office threw the whole thing online. By Monday afternoon the Drudge Report was linking to Cruz's truth-bomb, and the network was denying any bias in the edit room. D'Souza was tweeting it, beseeching readers to ""watch Bob Schieffer's reaction,"" without specifying which body language would make the theory true. That thumping sound you hear is the long tail of the 2013 IRS scandal. It's been eight months since the story broke, and subsequent investigations have found so little actual wrongdoing that House Republicans want the Department of Justice to probe the probes. Similar stories, like the NAACP's worry that it was being targeted in 2004, have ended with similar fizzles. None of this has diminished what the scandal meant to the right. Here was proof, after four years and so many loud complaints by Republican donors, that a lawless Obama administration was targeting them. ""Conspiracy theorists, who generally can survive in anaerobic environments, have just had an algae bloom dropped on their f--kin' heads,"" moaned Jon Stewart when the 2013 IRS story broke. ""This has, in one seismic moment, shifted the burden of proof from the tinfoil-behatted to the government."" The hats come in different sizes. In some camps on the right, the D'Souza indictment is part of a ""reign of terror""--that's Alex Jones' term--alongside the investigation of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and the arrest of Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell. ""They can put anybody in prison, the way these laws are written,"" Jones told fans in a special YouTube message. ""They're goin' for broke, because we're like cornered rats."" That's the extreme position. The centrist position is that D'Souza's troubles and the IRS scrutiny of Friends of Abe should be looked at on their own. Radio host Laura Ingraham, an author and occasional Fox News host, started her segment on D'Souza with a snippet of The Beatles's classic stalking ballad, ""I'll Get You."" The record scratched: Ingraham told listeners that ""we are criminalizing political dissent in the United States of America"" and nobody would call it out. ""This indictment is the kind of thing that we're kind of accustomed to seeing come out of a place like China, where they manhandle reporters,"" said Ingraham. ""They jail dissidents, they put them in re-education camps. Now, I'm beginning to think, if these people could put us all in reeducation camps, I'm beginning to think, in their wildest dreams, they wish they could just do that."" Do the D'Souza defenders have anything to say about the actual charges? Well, Ingraham made fun of how short the indictment was, and ... that's about it. Reporters who've actually compared the indictment to the timeline of donations and refunds to Long's campaign say they match up neatly. Reuters' Alison Frankel pointed out that campaign finance cases like this are common, and typically settled. The FBI saw an easy ""straw donor"" case. It pounced. But if you don't accept that theory--if you see the shadow hand of a conspiracy--you've got so much to gain. Drudge, Cruz, Ingraham, and company lose absolutely nothing by speculating about an Obama administration hit job in easily shareable news stories and videos. Friends of Abe gets a sympathetic A1 story in the New York Times, one that silences--for now, at least--some internal debate about whether Republican politicians were taking advantage of the group, seeing their celebrity members as potential donors. And before we ask how D'Souza comes out of this, consider where he's been. Back in 2012, around the time of the suspect donations, D'Souza resigned under duress from the presidency of King's College. He'd scandalized the evangelical community after appearing at a conference with his fiance, Denise Joseph, while not yet divorced from his wife. Denise Joseph happens to be the possible ""straw donor"" whose money was refunded by the Wendy Long campaign. What about his $33 million-grossing Obama movie? Ah, yes--about that. D'Souza's documentary had all the impact on Barack Obama's re-election that a horsefly has on a windshield. Before the election, when a Frank Luntz focus group of swing voters tested the effectiveness of some anti-Obama documentaries. ""It tested poorly,"" reported the New York Times. ""Luntz warned his clients that it could undermine their cause."" Now D'Souza himself is the cause. Things are looking up."	Why Conservatives Believe Obama Has Declared a Secret War on Their Heroes
17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/01/mitt_the_campaign_documentary_netflix_s_new_romney_film_is_really_a_home.html	"Mitt, the documentary about Willard Mitt Romney's two presidential campaigns, is not so much a campaign movie as it is a home movie. You can tell it's not a campaign movie because in the 90 minutes of behind-the-scenes private moments, none of the main characters utters a single swear word. If it were a political documentary, you'd have to send the kids to the other room. Instead, you should save a space on the couch for them to watch this story of a loving father and his family weathering the abuse of the modern political campaign with faith, good humor, and love. Another worthy audience for this film would be anyone thinking about running for office. This movie offers a glimpse of what it's like to endure the process, which has the appeal of a terminal illness and many of the similarities. Stress is a constant. Your sons, daughters, and spouse feel the abuse heaped on you more than you do. There's a lot of time spent in waiting rooms, and if you're the one with flagging health--in this case the candidate--you have to stomach everyone around you constantly trying to make you feel better. At the end, if you lose, it's like attending your own funeral, as Romney explains, where you have to walk the long line of people breaking down in front of you as they mourn your loss. If you are a prospective candidate, this film might help you test whether you have that elusive ""fire in the belly"" that candidates are supposed to have before they put in the order for the hats and the bunting. We hardly thought Mitt Romney was a brute at home, so the view of him as a good father and husband is not revelatory. You won't be surprised to see that he responds to moments of intense stress by tidying up--cleaning the trash from the hotel balcony before a debate or clearing the stray papers on election night. But the movie is intimate, which is never a word associated with the Romney campaign--or any modern campaign, for that matter. The filmmaker, Greg Whiteley, takes us into the inner sanctum, or the inner Radisson, as the case may be, since so much of campaign life happens on the generic couches of cookie-cutter hotels. So it's a little bracing when the candidate who tiptoed around his religion blurts out that voters know him as the ""flipping Mormon."" Or, when Romney, who like all candidates, spent his days pitching himself as the unique solution to America's problems and who never seemed ruffled, shows moments of doubt, suggesting at one point that he was a ""flawed candidate."" We've read about Barack Obama having these kinds of moments, but we've never had this kind of sustained up-close look at the most covered president in history. It's also one thing to hear a son say he believes in his dad, as all the Romney boys did in their media interviews, but it's another to watch Tagg Romney tear up as he tries to convince his father to run for president in the movie's opening scene. ""If you don't win, we'll still love you,"" he says. ""The country may think of you as a laughingstock, and we'll know the truth, and that's OK. But I think you have a duty to your country and to God to see what comes of it."" Or, to watch Romney explain to his sons why his own father was the ""real deal,"" while he merely achieved what he did because he was given a good start. When Romney realizes he has lost, his first questions are to his sons: He wants to know whether his loss will mess up their lives in any way. We all knew about Romney's faith, but seeing the family praying on their knees feels almost like an intrusion. The scenes between the candidate and his wife also ratify what we were told about their relationship during the campaign, but when she sits on his lap or gives him last-minute advice before a debate, the sweetness of their union fills out. This is a pretty all-boys movie--Mitt Romney, the ghost of George Romney, and the Romney sons create a special male dynamic--but Ann Romney is no smiling ornament. She is, in a way, the emotional center of this private world. Seeing Romney's faith--perhaps the most guarded aspect of the man--reminds us just how thick the nonsense was from people like Pastor Robert Jeffress who claimed that Romney wasn't a ""real Christian."" The candidate ends his prayers with a special appeal ""in the name of Jesus Christ,"" and before a debate he draws a sun on his cheat sheet to remind him of a New Testament passage. For any Christian, this portrait is perhaps the best model of sustained, private faith from a politician we've ever seen--distinct from the showy speeches and empty moralizing to interest groups we've grown accustomed to. This is a view of a man and a family where faith is as much a part of their lives as the strong chins and resilient hair. To give us this personal view, the filmmaker leaves out a lot. We see Romney sleeping on the floor of his plane, but we don't see much about Romney's inner policy convictions, except for a few brief moments where he talks about the burdens of regulations--a private monologue not that different from his stump speech. There's no rebalancing scene aimed at rebutting Romney's remarks about the 47 percent who don't support him. Huge portions of the campaign go uncovered--the entire 2012 nominating process, for example--and the larger campaign operation--the aides, the strategy maps, the tactics--is almost entirely absent. And as appealing a family movie as this may be, there are no fights, squabbles, or inner-family tension that must have occurred at some point. For this to be a complete portrait, it could have used some moments of grist. Surely the Romney clan had spats, which would have made all that hugging and love even more impressive. Since we never see those moments, the family sometimes appears like a living room in a Restoration Hardware catalog--too perfect for any actual human interaction. The film does not make the case for a Romney presidency either. Just because he's a great family man doesn't mean he should be president. Otherwise, those qualities would be enough to get Romney's fans to like President Obama, who is, by all accounts, just as devoted to his family. If these vignettes had come out during the campaign, perhaps in an effort to make the candidate more ""likeable,"" it would not have changed the outcome--indeed, it probably would have only opened the candidate and his family to the witless ridicule that is a part of the modern campaign. That Romney protected his family space as much as he did is a testament to him as a father, something we now understand better after seeing this film."	Mitt Isn't a Campaign Documentary--It's a Home Movie
18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/01/bob_mcdonnell_scandal_what_we_can_learn_from_the_alleged_ethical_lapses.html	"The devastating federal indictment of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife Maureen on 14 counts of corruption is a cautionary tale for modern politicians achieving meteoric rises and even speedier falls. The indictment itself reads like something from the Real Housewives of Someplace Awful: the seductive tug of private jets, designer gowns, golf trips, Rolex watches, and Louis Vuitton footwear. In exchange for thousands of dollars of gifts, loans, and perks from Jonnie R. Williams, the McDonnells allegedly used the governor's office to ""legitimize, promote, and obtain research studies"" to benefit Williams' sketchy dietary supplements company, Star Scientific. According to the indictment, the first couple also failed to disclose loans and stock purchases, and when federal investigators began to probe, they allegedly tried to cover it up. According to the Richmond Times-Dispatch, a conviction could put the couple behind bars for decades and come with more than $1 million in fines. They will be arraigned this Friday in Richmond. Already it's clear that there are lessons to be learned from the career implosion of a man once touted as a contender for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination. The most obvious is that the Commonwealth of Virginia's laughable historic claims that it requires no ethics laws because its politicians never get caught breaking its nonexistent ethics laws, can finally be put to rest. Currently, elected officials can accept gifts of unlimited value so long as they report them. And as the Washington Post editorialized Tuesday night, the proposed bipartisan effort to curb corruption in one of the most lax states in the nation is absolutely inadequate: ""Virginia needs a muscular ethics commission endowed with the resources and legal authority to pursue real investigations,"" the editorial board writes. ""Virginia needs much stricter limits not just on gifts to politicians and their families but also on campaign contributions. Virginia needs meaningful laws limiting the way campaign funds can be spent."" Terry McAuliffe, the new governor, made ethics reform a hallmark of his campaign, and, just last week, issued an executive order setting a gift acceptance cap of $100 and allocating funds for a state ethics commission. That he plans to simply work around the General Assembly, which has slow-walked various ethics reform proposals for years, suggests that he takes the need for reform in the commonwealth very seriously. Now we all know why. Another enduring lesson of the scandal, as Chris Cillizza notes, is that blurry ethical lines only become clearer in the rearview mirror--or in the pages of a 43-page indictment--and that wealthy donors are never really your ""friends"" in the first place: ""It seems quite clear from what we know about the McDonnells and Jonnie Williams that Virginia's First Couple became enamored with the sort of lifestyle that Williams provided them. A vacation home at Smith Mountain Lake! A Ferrari (drive)! Rolexes! The deeper the McDonnells got into the world of Williams--and the longer that involvement seemed consequence-less,"" Cillizza writes, ""the line that separates donors from the politicians they donate to (which, in truth, is always somewhat blurry) got erased completely."" It's counterintuitive, but maybe there is something about the heady charms of fast cars and couture gowns that makes them seem, by definition, ethical. Or more precisely, perhaps there is some sense that with that first rush of power and glamor, the very absence of all the lovely perks is, well, somehow unethical. ""We are broke, have an unconscionable amount in credit card debt already, and this Inaugural is killing us!!"" Maureen McDonnell lashed out in an email to an aide to the then-governor-elect in December 2009. The aide had suggested it would be inappropriate for her to allow Williams to buy her an inaugural gown. ""I need answers and I need help, and I need to get this done,"" she pleaded, because when you believe yourself entitled to absolutely everything, it's easy to justify everything you need to do to get it. Perhaps another lesson is that fiscal conservatism is a myth for many who spout it most vociferously. The man who campaigned on fiscal-minded sobriety, largely charmed the commonwealth with his soft-spoken political style, and achieved hugely popular reforms on kitchen-table issues--including mass-transit reform, pension reform, and education--was fundamentally incapable of walking the walk when it came to his own life: He successfully governed like a sober fiscal conservative while he opted to live like he was Lord Grantham. Apparently the bare minimum one can manage, while still keeping up appearances these days, includes a pair of Virginia Beach houses, bought for $2 million in 2005 and 2006, a $1 million home at the Wintergreen resort, and an $835,000 home outside Richmond. Minimum. The gaping disparity between the sober, fiscally cautious stated GOP values by which he campaigned, and the McDonnells' profligate lifestyle is a tacit endorsement of the notion that living within your means is only a rule for chumps. Ultimately, it's always useful to recall that the McDonnells are still innocent unless and until they are proven otherwise, and that Virginia politicians have been getting away with similarly grotesque ethical conduct for a long time; McDonnell is just the first who may serve jail time for it. But in an era of deeply polarized politics, broken government, and elected officials who are bought and sold for much more than McDonnell is accused of accepting (and happy birthday to you, Citizens United), one last important lesson might be offered up from the McDonnell tragedy: Bob McDonnell was a hugely effective governor in a riven state. While the rest of the nation struggled, he presided over a statewide expansion in prosperity and opportunity. Sworn in as a rabid social conservative, McDonnell gradually modulated his most extreme views (and the often radical views of his attorney general) on issues ranging from gay rights to transvaginal ultrasounds, and disappointed critics on the right with his transportation initiative and his committed efforts to restore civil rights to ex-felons. His new budget offers additional funding for mental-health care, higher education funding, and more money for K-12 and Pre-K education. Forbes named Virginia the best state in the U.S. for business in 2013 and McDonnell presided over two consecutive years of a budget surplus. Even when some initiatives--money funneled to charter schools--looked to simply be all about chasing the money, the fact is that homelessness is down 16 percent in the commonwealth, more than 170,000 new jobs have been created, and McDonnell oversaw significant adoption reform. McDonnell reportedly worked 14-hour days. He evinced none of the deranged ideological zealotry of a Rick Perry, none of the thuggery of a Chris Christie, and none of the gratuitous cruelty of a Scott Walker. That a fundamentally temperate, deeply religious, family-oriented pragmatist and former military man could have been so completely and mindlessly swept up by the Gatsby-dreams of the 1 percent may prove to be the ultimate tragedy here. In a world of government by the Mitt Romneys, of the Mitt Romneys, and for the Mitt Romneys, Bob McDonnell actually wasn't ever a Mitt Romney. His downfall lay in trying to become one. Maybe in the world of politics, there is no other way to be."	Lessons From the Meteoric Rise and Spectacular Fall of Bob McDonnell
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/01/david_remnick_s_obama_profile_the_new_yorker_s_profile_of_the_president.html	"It seems that every State of the Union address must now come with a slogan. In 2011, it was ""Win the Future."" In 2012, the slogan was ""Built to Last."" For 2013, it was ""Let's Get It Done,"" and this year the president will treat us to a ""Year of Action."" He and his staff have been test-driving the phrase for months. The president used it again in his Saturday radio address. Though Congress may block him, the president says he's determined to use every tool at his disposal to get something done. ""Where Congress isn't acting, I'll act on my own to put opportunity within reach for anyone who's willing to work for it,"" the president said on Saturday. Sounds exciting, plus the slogan ""A Year of Grinding Torpor"" or ""More of the Same"" don't really fit the spirit of the enterprise. But on the eve of the annual speech, a New Yorker profile of the president doesn't paint the picture of a man of action--at least not the way that word is being used in the White House's slogan. Instead of coming across as a man engaging his considerable faculties in an energetic effort to overcome the limits of his office, the president seems content with tending the store, confident that the verdict of history will smile on him. He's not worried about being measured against the vestiges of an old notion of the presidency. This may be a realistic view of things, but it doesn't really match the call for action. The president gave New Yorker editor and Obama biographer David Remnick special access over several days late last year to talk about his administration and his plans for the future. It was similar to the wide-ranging set of interviews the president gave Michael Lewis a year ago for a Vanity Fair profile. In the Lewis interview, the president was buoyant, game for Lewis' conceit to train a person for the presidency in 30 minutes. He invited the writer to play basketball with him and needled him for his sloppy defense. Remnick's piece starts out with the president nursing a fat lip from a recent game. In the Lewis piece, Obama talked about the limitations of his office but also talked about its potential, as if he was still sifting through the tool chest for some Allen wrench that might yield a fresh result. The Obama of the New Yorker profile wears the limitations of his office like a shawl. ""At the end of the day we're part of a long-running story,"" the president says. ""We just try to get our paragraph right."" At another time he describes himself as ""a relay swimmer in a river full of rapids, and that river is history."" To the crowd at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser that applauds a heckler's insistence he use more executive orders, Remnick reports him responding: ""Before everybody starts clapping, that's not how it works. We've got this Constitution, we've got this whole thing about separation of powers. So there is no shortcut to politics, and there's no shortcut to democracy."" His parting words to Remnick are about limits. ""The President of the United States cannot remake our society, and that's probably a good thing. Not 'probably.' It's definitely a good thing."" The president talks about income inequality and fighting for the middle class as the driving motives for his presidency's final years, but there's a lack of ardor. It's the difference between reading a story about someone saying they're going to run a marathon and reading one where they are running hills each morning at 5 a.m. In this narrative, the president is mostly described working his will on high-dollar Democratic donors whose money he'll need for the bruising midterm elections--which will add another set of constraints to action. The president's comments reflect the triumph of experience over hope. He long ago tempered his claims about transforming partisan politics--he now seems a little embarrassed about the whole thing. But the tone of the piece also shows how realistic he has become about harnessing the power of his electoral success and the national mood he claimed it represented. That was a promise of the Obama presidency that didn't rely on a willing Congress. He had a special relationship with voters and he was going to turn it into a force. He called on that bond in his second inaugural address: ""You and I, as citizens, have the power to set this country's course. You and I, as citizens, have the obligation to shape the debates of our time--not only with the votes we cast, but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals."" But when he talks about tackling income inequality he no longer speaks of national movements. It's not because the public isn't ready to be led. The country is still looking for a political champion to rally them, but unlike a previous version of Obama who would have promised that he could channel the passion outside Washington to change Washington, his aspirations are more modest now. He hopes to give ""voice to an impression, I think a lot of Americans have, which is it's harder to make it now if you are just the average citizen who's willing to work hard and has good values, and wasn't born with huge advantages or having enjoyed extraordinary luck--that the ground is less secure under your feet."" After six years the president recognizes that people are looking for ""other flavors ... somebody else out there who can give me that spark of inspiration or excitement."" If this more realistic posture seems at odds with the call to a ""Year of Action,"" that may be only because we are misinterpreting what President Obama means by action. He's not talking about showy gestures, but actions that unfold over a much longer timeline. In the realistic assessment of his office, the president offers a theory about presidential progress. ""Sometimes the things that start small may turn out to be fairly significant. I suspect that Ronald Reagan, if you'd asked him, would not have considered the earned-income-tax-credit provision in tax reform to be at the top of his list of accomplishments. On the other hand, what the E.I.T.C. has done, starting with him, being added to by Clinton, being used by me during the Recovery Act, has probably kept more people out of poverty than a whole lot of other government programs that are currently in place."" This is the Johnny Appleseed version of the presidency in which important programs ignored by the daily press make a huge impact in people's lives in the future. That is the essential argument of Michael Grunwald's book The New New Deal on the $800 billion Obama stimulus package passed early in his tenure. Judged at the time based on whether it would halt the economic slowdown, its lasting impact may well be in the programs it launched--everything from Race to the Top to improve education, to ideas promoting electronic medical records to transportation innovations, to support for clean energy. Remnick treats this evolution of Obama's vision as a laudable outgrowth of his special temperament. The president takes the ""long view,"" a sensible antidote to the conventional wisdom that a president must achieve success on big things quickly and almost despite the obstacles. This is right, but it is not Obama's insight alone. This view about history's verdict provided solace to George W. Bush as well. Bush also said he was never worried about the day-to-day evaluations of his presidency because history's verdict was all that mattered. ""You can't possibly figure out the history of the Bush presidency--until I'm dead,"" he told Robert Draper in a typical remark. According to Peter Baker's book Days of Fire, Bush and Obama also shared another realization. In the New Yorker interview, Obama seems to be embracing a view of the presidency's limitations that Bush offered in the response to an aide who asked him what surprised him the most about his presidency.  ""How little authority I have,"" said Bush."	Why President Obama Isn't About to Snap Into Action 
20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/01/california_minimum_wage_meet_the_libertarian_multimillionaire_who_is_pushing.html	"Ron Unz buried the lede. Two and a half years ago, when the Silicon Valley multimillionaire was still publisher of the American Conservative, Unz penned a characteristically sweeping piece about ""Immigration, the Republicans, and the End of White America."" Unz methodically pulled in data and anecdotes--primary vote totals, demographics, 1993 letters to the editor of Commentary--to explain why closed-border politics could not save the GOP, no matter what the right told itself. Page after page filled with ink before Unz got to his solution. ""Consider the consequences of a very substantial rise in the national minimum wage,"" wrote Unz, ""perhaps to $10 or more likely $12 per hour."" Knees would jerk, conservatives would call this socialism, but Unz knew better. When Henry Ford doubled the wages of his assembly line workers, it was ""a crucial factor in creating the prosperous middle class that eventually dominated America's 20th-century history."" It was time again for a wage hike, an idea that ""raises the income of America's working class and similarly crosses many ideological lines."" No conservative politician joined Unz on the barricade. Two years later, he cut his ties to the magazine, looked into the mirror, and saw Henry Ford staring back. As soon as next week, California will approve the language of Unz's ballot measure to raise the minimum wage to $10, then $12. If that happens, Unz just needs to muscle enough signatures to put this on the ballot. ""I'd never really focused on the minimum wage issue, by itself, until recently,"" says Unz over the phone, from his home in Palo Alto. ""To the extent that everyone in the economic profession was making another argument, that raising the minimum wage would kill jobs, I vaguely nodded my head."" In Unz's circles, among libertarian and conservative intellectuals and donors, almost nobody endorsed a higher minimum wage. Any fool who could draw a curve could prove that higher mandatory wages kicked low-skilled workers out of the job market and onto welfare. ""The belief that increasing the minimum wage is socially beneficial is a delusion,"" wrote Cato Institute scholar James Dorn in a recent reading from the catechism, citing the 40 percent unemployment rate for black teens. ""In 2007, prior to the Great Recession, the black teen unemployment rate was about 29 percent. There is no doubt the increase in the federal minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 per hour contributed to the higher unemployment rate."" This stopped being convincing to Unz, who made his fortune by designing software that allowed mortgages to be chopped up into securities, and whose IQ has clocked in at 214. ""Once I started investigating the details,"" he says, ""it really seemed like the facts were on the other side--especially since so much of the economy has shifted from manufacturing to other industries. You can always relocate manufacturing jobs. You can't ship McDonald's jobs to India or Bangladesh."" Unz was alone on this, for a while. Nothing unusual there. Journalists have been writing ""Ron Unz, rebel conservative"" stories for a generation, ever since his 1998 ballot measure that ended California's bilingual education. ""This isn't your usual picture of a Republican millionaire on a mission,"" wrote the New Republic when Unz tackled campaign finance laws. ""After decades in the conservative movement, Mr. Unz is pursuing a goal that has stymied liberals,"" wrote the New York Times two months ago. This works to Unz's advantage; ""liberals continue to support higher wages"" isn't much of a story, and California's 2013 passage of a phased-in $10 minimum wage law was seen on the right as the Golden State fulfilling its annual quota for kooky socialism. What's new, and what Unz didn't expect, was a mini-surge of interest from fellow conservatives about the minimum wage. The long tail of Mitt Romney's defeat played a role in that, as conservatives struggled to explain why even voters who'd suffered in the downturn had voted for the president. The 2013 push for immigration reform played a role, too, rousing the old Buchanan-ite wing of the movement that panicked about undocumented workers flooding low-wage, low-skill jobs. ""The lowest-wage workers in America disproportionately tend to be recent immigrants,"" says Unz. ""You look at a job that pays $7.25 an hour, you raise the value of that job to $12, and suddenly a lot of Americans would take those jobs. A lot of our illegal-immigration problems are solved--there's less incentive to violate the law and immigration rules."" But immigration was fading as a first-order political issue in Washington. Inequality was surging. President Obama floated a $10.10 minimum wage during the State of the Union, absorbed the mockery, and then turned it into the centerpiece of a populist campaign to rebuild his support. Conservatives began to take him seriously. ""Legislation to raise the minimum wage would elevate many low-wage earners above the income threshold that qualifies them for benefits,"" wrote conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly, ""and should result in reduced welfare spending."" She cited a study by the Cato Institute, suggesting that welfare paid more than minimum wages in 35 states. The libertarians had accidentally made the case for the policy they despised. A week later, Bill O'Reilly was table-banging about the fairness of the $10 minimum wage. Neil Munro, the reporter who earned Internet fame for hectoring the president about immigration, interviewed Unz and predicted his idea would ""catch fire."" The resistance was ready for this, but divided against itself. Reliable corporate fronts like the Employment Policies Institute attacked the wage hike, full stop, no alternatives. Conservatives who wanted to win elections dismissed it, but only as a way of supporting some other, better anti-poverty balm. ""Our current president and his liberal allies propose that we address this by spending more on these failed programs and increasing the minimum wage to $10.10,"" said Marco Rubio in a Jan. 8 speech marking the anniversary of the War on Poverty. ""Raising the minimum wage may poll well, but having a job that pays $10 an hour is not the American Dream."" Rubio, copping from conservative intellectuals like Yuval Levin, preferred a wage subsidy that would give money directly to the poor.* ""That's a terrible idea,"" says Unz. ""It's basically a welfare program. What the government does with the EITC is make poor people somewhat less poor by putting checks in the mail. Forget all of the other problems with that--you're talking about a massive subsidy to low-wage employers. How's that going to work politically? Increasing taxes to pay increased welfare benefits--how many conservatives are going to go for that?"" In Washington? That's easy--conservatives don't need to ""go for"" anything. The national Republican Party is pretty confident it can win in 2014 by reminding voters that Obamacare exists. Unz is giving them a chance to endorse something else, something voters identify with liberals, and compete for working-class votes on positive terms. It's a tool, like the software he developed, the stuff that allowed quants to chop up mortgages into securities. ""Frankly, I used to always tell all my Wall Street clients that all my software did was to produce financial outputs based on the inputs they themselves provided, and I just couldn't see how anyone could ever predict the correct inputs,"" says Unz. ""They said: Don't worry about that--we're paying millions of dollars to all these research experts to decide what the correct inputs should be. I told them I was pretty skeptical about that, but I supposed it was their business."" *Correction, Jan. 17, 2013: The article originally stated that Sen. Marco Rubio preferred an earned-income tax credit to a minimum wage increase. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"	Meet the Libertarian Who's Fighting to Raise California's Minimum Wage

In 1989, as the crack wars raged, the DEA ran a sting in front of the White House just so the president could wave a bag of it on TV-- ""as innocent looking as candy."" A few months later, three-term Mayor Marion Barry was caught smoking crack by an FBI camera, temporarily shaming him out of politics. Even now, if you live in D.C. long enough you're likely to be contacted by the feds and asked if someone you know, someone working through a background check to secure a government job, has done anything to be ashamed about. But if you're white and live in one of D.C.'s decent neighborhoods, the drug laws are nothing to worry about. I learned that again over the weekend, when I wound up at a party in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood--as gentrified as it sounds--and smoked some pot in a backyard with a few friends. After a few more-hilarious-than-usual conversations, I walked home, taking in the parfum of a Schedule 1 substance from a few more backyards and porches. Nobody that night seemed very worried about the law. Nor should they have been. In D.C., black people and white people are just as likely to smoke pot. Black people are at least eight times more likely to be arrested for it. That's untenable, especially in a culturally liberal city that votes roughly 19-1 for Democratic presidential candidates And that's why the D.C. council is trying to reduce marijuana to a parking ticket-level offense:  $25 if you're caught with less an than ounce, $100 if you're smoking outside. Selling and growing would stay illegal, but the smokers wouldn't be collared anymore. At a brief, 16-minute public meeting today, five members of the judiciary committee voted to advance the Marijuana Possession Decriminalization Amendment Act of 2014. Three of them--Tommy Wells, Jack Evans, and Muriel Bowser--are currently running for mayor. Twenty-four years after Marion Barry humiliated himself with a crack pipe, three possible successors were jostling to be the most pro-pot candidate. There will be no anti-pot candidate. The decriminalization bill, endorsed by 10 of 13 council members, will probably be law by the spring. And Barry himself co-wrote it. ""The only pushback or pressure,"" said Wells after the vote, ""has been about why don't we just go ahead and legalize, why don't we just tax and regulate. The problem is that might cause Congress to step in. This is such an issue of social justice that I don't want to slow this part down. I'm afraid that would get jammed up. I want to get this out of the way, address the social justice issue. Then we can have a conversation about legalization."" Wells mentioned ""social justice"" a few more times, totally forthright about the challenge of winning a mayoral primary as a white guy. A nearby radio reporter who knew Wells ribbed him about winning ""the 2 percent of the black vote"" that was gettable. Incumbent Mayor Vincent Gray, like every mayor of D.C. since home rule began, is black. Wells and the other council members were riding a wave, to ""put racial justice at the heart of the legalization movement,"" as Nation editor Katrina Vanden Heuvel said last week on MSNBC. Congress--that was less fun to talk about. Congress could, theoretically, undo this law and protect the area around its offices from creeping Vancouver-ization. But why would it? To block decriminalization, Congress could use its mandatory 30-day review period to pass a resolution disapproving of the law. I asked a bunch of Republican flacks, most of them on the relevant oversight or judiciary committees, whether they'd try this. The response was either ""no comment"" or no awareness of the bill. Decriminalization campaigners aren't expecting that to change. ""There's just not the will at this point to stop D.C. from doing this,"" suggested Dan Riffle, director of federal policies at the Marijuana Policy Project. ""Even the old reliable opponents, the Chuck Grassleys of the world, have stopped talking about it. The more likely threat to the bill would be a rider, one of hundreds of lines slipped into a must-pass bill."" That's another case study in how the politics have changed. In 1998, before D.C. voters approved a medical marijuana initiative, the Republican-controlled Congress thwarted it with an amendment to a spending bill. No federal funds or local could be used to implement the initiative. It took 11 years for Congress to rewrite that language, barring only the federal funds, less of a problem in the city's boom years. Washington was free to legalize dispensaries, which it did, under incredibly strict conditions that saw only 111 people making use of the service last year. Medical marijuana isn't much of a ""social justice"" issue. Decriminalization is. At the judiciary hearing on Wednesday, chairman Wells praised the new bill for possibly ""ending the disenfranchisement of a significant section of our city."" The only quasi-disagreement came when Bowser (who's black) asked the council to think about the next steps, about legalization. ""I want to know, if it's not a crime to possess it, where then are people buying it?"" she asked. ""How are we going to deal with that? Certainly, we don't want to go back to the days when we had open-air drug selling in our city. The logic of legalization makes more sense to me than decriminalization... regulating how people can procure this now-decriminalized marijuana has to be, I think, the second step."" That was it; that was the debate. The bill passed on a voice vote, on to the full city council, in a city that used to panic about drugs. ""Let the record show it was unanimous,"" said Wells."	The D.C. Council Is About To Decriminalize Pot. And Marion Barry Co-Wrote the Bill.
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/01/chris_christie_perfect_antidote_to_barack_obama.html	"As Bridgeimbroglio unfolds in New Jersey, we are likely to get to a forensic tour through Chris Christie's administration. Democrats in the Legislature are investigating, the U.S. attorney is too, and the news media are picking through every trash bin. The Political Institute of Dark Arts is also probably doing an in-house review to see how someone could so badly mishandle the use of intimidation and political pressure. These investigations will illuminate the case at hand and tell us whether Christie can survive as a presidential candidate. We are also going to learn something about power, and how it is wielded in modern politics. Christie's administration was effective, in part, because it knew how to use a variety of the tools of power available to a governor. We may also learn something about the presidency. Christie's central presidential pitch is that he can be more effective than the president or Congress. Before the bridge scandal, voters had to sort of accept this on faith, or wait for a few in-depth stories to sketch out the details of the Christie Way. Now everyone has an opportunity to evaluate every piece of new evidence about the way he worked in New Jersey, in real time, and to imagine if it would work in Washington. While Trenton turns, President Obama is wrestling afresh with his own paradox of presidential power: In some cases you don't have much and in some cases you are accused of having too much. Entering his sixth year, President Obama is trying to create leverage to further his domestic agenda while at the same time battling members of Congress who want to limit his ability to negotiate with Iran and revisit his policy on spying. Since Barack Obama barreled into office with his big 2008 election victory and the Tea Party reshaped congressional politics, we have been holding a national conversation about the limits of presidential power in Washington. How limited is the man, how limited is the office, and how constrained is this president by his opposition? In his State of the Union address, the president will call 2014 a ""year of action."" That phrase is both a political trap and a sign of resignation. It's a trap because 2014 might not be a year of action at all. It's an election year where control of the Senate is at stake, which means the self-interest of members of Congress will most likely tilt them away from cooperation. By calling it a year of action the president hopes to put the blame on the other party if there isn't any. Nothing got done? Don't blame me or the Democrats. We were ready for action. The president will also warn that he will take executive action wherever he can in order to make progress if Republicans in Congress won't meet him halfway. Barack Obama has been looking for new sources of power since he came to Washington. He has tried to cajole with bipartisan gestures, to ram through legislation, he's made big speeches to mobilize public opinion, and he tried to use his 2012 election victory to ""break the fever."" He has had mixed results. Throughout, his allies have made a consistent diagnosis: He should be tougher, like say Chris Christie. Sean Wilentz says he should have reformed the filibuster rules when Democrats held both houses of Congress and pushed through legislation. George Packer's ""Obama's Lost Year,"" paints the picture of an uncoordinated chief executive unwilling to take bold political chances. James Carville suggested the president lacked a certain anatomical manliness. Obama adviser David Axelrod admitted the president was ""too eager"" to play nice with the GOP. Michael Tomasky asked if Obama's lack of effort attacking Congress meant he was too weak to win in November 2012. The president is even accused of governing in the passive voice. Chris Christie is not weak. He's on the other side of the scale. Until last week, that was seen, on balance, as an advantage. He'd been called a bully, but his brusque manner was seen as the sidecar to his ability to get things done. Christie's tough-guy persona conveyed, as David Simon writes, a ""plain-speaking insistence on results."" Christie could be the perfect answer for a country that likes to elect presidents who are antidotes to their predecessors. But would Christie's tough approach actually work in Washington? That's what we're going to get a chance to parse. The George Washington Bridge episode is an abuse of power, but it's also a gross miscarriage of the proper use of the political power of retaliation. (They killed a flea with a hydrogen bomb.) Politicians need to be able to retaliate, punish, and encourage. It's a requirement, particularly when formal powers don't give you leverage. You must create it by whatever means you can--as long as those tactics don't get you in trouble. It's clear from what we know about Chris Christie that he used these powers prodigiously, rewarding the mayors who played ball with him and punishing the allies and enemies who didn't. What's clear from these accounts, though, is that if Christie's little packets of retribution were a contributing factor in his success as governor, they will be impossible to duplicate as president. Why is that? If one of these stories of payback associated with Christie were about a president, it would melt cable news and freeze the Internet. Presidents just can't throw around muscle in Washington in the same way. Two recent examples: When George W. Bush's office gently leaned on Sen. Jim Jeffords during the early period of the Bush presidency, it contributed to the Vermont senator's abandonment of the Republican Party, which switched control of the Senate and put it in Democratic hands. When Barack Obama tried an old-fashioned act of horse-trading to win support for his health care plan with Nebraska Sen. Ben Nelson, the famous ""Cornhusker kickback"" became a scandal and had to be withdrawn. Presidents are at once granted enormous power and faced with severe limitations on that power. So while President Obama is rubbing his lucky rabbit foot, minting new phrases and doing any other manner of hocus-pocus to conjure some domestic political power, he is being accused of abusing his national security powers. Friday he will give back some of that particular kind of power, announcing support for measures that will constrain the National Security Agency. On the recent agreement with Iran the president faces a revolt from Congress, which might pass a sanctions bill to punish Iran if it doesn't stand by the commitments its leaders made to the president's negotiators. The president says such a bill would kill the deal. In both instances, the American people must trust the president to have their interests at heart and not abuse his office. Much of the Iran deal is secret and much of the executive branch's NSA and intelligence operations are secret, too (despite the Snowden revelations). For those who worry about an unchecked commander in chief, Obama's think-twice, reasoned approach might seem very attractive. He has never rushed off to do anything, and yet the president is still under fire. This raises a different question for Chris Christie. It's not whether he has the capacity to build up the power a president needs in the domestic realm. The question is whether he and his team know when to employ restraint when they have a lot of power. (There was certainly no restraint when it came to tying up traffic on the George Washington Bridge.) Christie has a shorter fuse than Obama. He gets from A to Z fast. (To make a point about the dangers of isolationism, he brings in the heavy artillery of the attacks on 9/11 and its victims.) How much is Christie's internal operation--the workings of his administration--guided by his expedient temperament? When, by contrast, for the greater good did he not use his powers, even though he could?"	Is Chris Christie Actually the Perfect Antidote to Obama?

It's Jan. 9, and the 32-year-old Republican strategist is perched in front of his Macbook Air, explaining how the first lady just hurt the Democrats' candidate for an open Senate seat in West Virginia. ""I'm pulling it up. Okay. Here's a great Charleston Daily Mail headline: 'Michelle Obama backs Natalie Tennant in Senate race.' "" Miller laughs, because of course that's a horrible headline. Nothing about it draws the reader in, or tells them what gaffes or toxic admissions might have happened when Obama arrived. The paper buried the ledes. ""She talks about health care,"" says Miller. ""She talks about gun control. She talks about immigration. I don't know if she mentioned Keystone, but even the EPA regulations--that was something Michelle Obama mentioned. If you're any of these Democrat candidates running in red states, any of the issues I just mentioned is kryptonite."" It's Miller's job to obsess about those details. He runs America Rising PAC, the Republican-aligned opposition research factory launched 10 months ago by Mitt Romney's defeated campaign manager Matt Rhoades. After the election, the Republican National Committee researched and released an autopsy of the loss. The party needed, according to the RNC, was a group that did ""nothing but post inappropriate Democrat utterances and act as a clearinghouse for information on Democrats."" Miller left the RNC to join the clearinghouse; As of last week, between the PAC and the LLC run by fellow oppo vet Joe Pounder, America Rising employed 47 more people, full or part-time. America Rising found office space in the right-to-work concrete paradise of northern Virginia, one metro stop outside of Washington, D.C. Visitors walk into a minimalist space, with no receptionist, past a coffee table that stacks old magazines with conservative cover stars. Every few feet there's a portrait of a Republican icon like Teddy Roosevelt or a ha-ha-remember-that joke at a Democrats' expense. The centerpiece is a blown-up photo of John Kerry taking a bodysuited windsurfing break during the 2004 campaign. They bought it on eBay. That's about it. The office is quiet, no TVs blaring cable news, most TVs relegated to a ""war room"" away from the researchers' desks. Many of its employees spend their days ""tracking"" Democratic candidates, particular Senate candidates in key states. These trackers attempt to shoot video of every single public utterance the candidates' make, in hopes of catching gaffes and flip-flops and collecting an archive that can be mined for hypocrisy and errors. ""Big oppo"" is the Republican response to the Democrats' highly successful American Bridge project, whose 2012 work Pounder and Miller praise effusively. ""In the down-ticket races, they don't get enough credit for working with the outside groups,"" says Miller. ""Sierra Club, House Majority PAC - you can see the Bridge influence. And that allowed them to put a lot of pressure on the [communications] shops of our candidates. But that oppo they did on our Senate and House candidates jammed up our candidates' shops. Every minute they're spending going back to FEC reports to knock down a lead from a reporter, a lead they got from American Bridge, is a minute they're not spending on something that advances their interests."" One reason why America Rising and American Bridge do so much tracking is that it is easier now--quick uploads where there used to be lengthy ftp wait times. ""I did tracking for Romney in 2007, 2008,"" recalls Pounder. ""Was it you guys that did Bomb, Bomb Iran?"" asks Miller, referring to a video of Sen. John McCain responding to a question from a voter by rewriting the lyrics of a Beach Boys hit. ""Or was that on the news?"" ""That was tracker footage,"" says Pounder. Inside Miller's office, where he and Pounder are talking through the plans for 2014--they expect a budget of $10 million to $15 million, according to the Huffington Post--there's a bookshelf with a copy of What A Party!, the chest-thumping, golf-game-reminiscing memoir by now-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe. It's a memento of their first real loss. America Rising came up with one of the most theoretically damaging hits on McAuliffe, a promotional video for his troubled car company, GreenTech. The man who'd repeatedly talked about bringing a car company from China to America stood in Outer Mongolia, grinning about the 15 million square foot facility going up there. Neither Republican campaigns nor reporters had noticed it. America Rising found it buried on the GreenTech site. Other hits followed, all on this theme, but McAuliffe won anyway. ""McAuliffe was a better candidate, no doubt, than four years ago,"" offers Miller. ""He was on message. They knew their candidate's weaknesses. He benefited by not being a new candidate--he goes off message and, oh, that's just Terry, acting crazy! That's just Terry, being folksy again. In 2013 a lot of the media felt that stuff had been asked and answered."" ""The campaign kept him from doing one-on-one interviews,"" says Pounder. ""The one interview he did, the [Virginia political reporter] Ryan Nobles interview, we used in every ad! The ad that tested the best was from that interview."" ""Very few press gaggles after his events,"" adds Pounder. ""But hiding a candidate is not a path to success in statewide races,"" says Miller. ""That's not a path to success for [Kentucky Senate candidate] Alison Lundergan Grimes or [Georgia Senate candidate] Michelle Nunn. The hard questions are going to get asked and answered."" America Rising is counting on candidates being questioned in states that have been voting Republican for president or where the local Democratic party has been losing elections: Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana, Montana, North Carolina. ""Think about where the battleground map is,"" says Miller. ""This or that remark might not be that damning in Massachusetts, but many of the competitive races are happening on turf that Romney won."" Republicans need to win six Senate seats to take total control of Congress, and they realize they could have done this earlier if they hadn't nominated losers in a few 2010 and 2012 races, or if millions of dollars hadn't been blown on stupid ads. All their tracking can serve as a foundation for the 2014 contests. ""Something in a research file now that doesn't seem relevant may be relevant six months from now,"" says Pounder. ""The benefit of working on this full time, through the cycle, is that you'll stay aware of it."" ""I think there's a misconception that this is happening in order to catch [Iowa Senate candidate] Bruce Braley saying he's upset with the lack of towels in the House gym during the shutdown. That's fun, that gets on Jimmy Kimmel, that's not the point. Three months from now if there's a controversy regarding some local official in Arkansas, we can go back and we know what Mark Pryor said about it. When the NSA thing popped last summer, probably nothing any of these candidates said about the NSA had ever raised a red flag. But now we've catalogued that information, so when the next NSA pops up, we know what they said."" ""If we were sitting here a year ago,"" says Pounder, ""nobody would have said 'if you like your plan, you can keep your plan' would be an issue. OK. Kay Hagan has said it numerous times. Mark Pryor has said it once or twice. That's just the tip of the iceberg. Then you go back to everything they're starting to say since the debate started. They didn't just say, 'if you like your plan you can keep it.' They said, if you like your doctor, you can keep him.' They said, 'I do like the public option.' They said, 'maybe Obamacare didn't go far enough.' They were intricate players in the debate, and most of that is on video."" Why would support for a public option hurt a candidate? ""It fits in because you ask: You thought Obamacare's implementation was bad? They wanted to go even further."" America Rising is the freezer of the Republican party, storing messages and narratives are, that can be taken out at the right moment, microwaved, and served to voters."

24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/01/bridgeghazi_christie_s_press_conference_about_the_fort_lee_scandal_was_audacious.html	"For two hours New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie did a full hangout, or at least as close as we're likely to get in politics these days. He held a marathon press conference to respond to the George Washington Bridge traffic scandal that exploded Wednesday and imperiled his presidential aspirations. He announced that he was firing the staffer responsible, cutting some ties with one of his top political aides, and investigating what other abuses might be left uncovered. He then took round after round of questions in which he fulfilled most of the compulsory requirements of the public self-flagellation routine. He apologized, took responsibility, called himself ""embarrassed and humiliated,"" said the ""buck stops here,"" expressed regret, denounced the activity several times as ""callous"" and ""stupid,"" and announced that he was visiting the injured parties today. Christie did the best he could given the circumstances, which are that a petty act of vindictiveness by one of his aides closed down access to a portion of the busiest bridge in the world. This act, in which Christie has not been directly implicated, but which until Wednesday was not nearly so close to him, threatens to transform Christie's blunt, hard-charging image into that of a bully. Or at the very least it raises the possibility that his administration tolerated this kind of hardball freelancing. You don't recover from that in a single press conference, but you can start the road to repair. Christie's press conference matched his political personality. At times it was a virtuoso performance. In an age when presidents and other politicians only grudgingly accept responsibility, Christie appeared to embrace his duties as the chief executive not just in words but in action. At other times his emphasis on himself made it seem for stretches like he was more upset that he had been lied to by a staffer than that the staffer had snarled traffic in Fort Lee. Christie said he was simply reacting on a personal level to a breach of trust, but it highlighted a question that comes up at any such press conference: Is it a self-centered act of political preservation or a genuine moment of public outrage? Christie had said several weeks ago that his administration was not involved in the closure. That turned out not to be true. Why should anyone believe him now? The hope with this kind of press conference is that by showing that you have nothing to hide, you rebuild credibility. But as you let it all hang out, you also build a Jenga tower--an impressive structure that raises the stakes. Christie made a lot of promises Thursday afternoon: He didn't know about the episode; he had been lied to; the bullying wasn't indicative of his administration; he was simply a longtime acquaintance of David Wildstein, the Port Authority official who took part in the closure, not a childhood friend; he didn't condone a culture of retribution; he didn't know the exact details of the supposed traffic study that was used as cover for the lane closures. If one of those turns out not to be true, then the entire structure comes crashing down. Also implicit in the candid responses was the promise that Christie wasn't holding anything back about any of the related issues. When you let it all hang out, you can't survive if later it is discovered that you had more to give. Some claims, like Christie's that he is ""nowhere near"" thinking about a 2016 presidential campaign and that this episode wasn't reflective of his way of doing business, are exaggerations that shade his effort to show candor. Christie is certainly somewhere near thinking about 2016, and his career has been defined at times by his brusque manner. There were also a few internal inconsistencies in Christie's remarks. He promised to do an intense investigation, but he didn't talk to Bridget Anne Kelly, the main perpetrator. (Christie said that when he learned she had lied to him, it was a sufficient firing offense and that to talk to her would have been to prejudice ongoing investigations). If Christie's pitch is that he's a straight-ahead guy who doesn't BS, that is the guy most people will see as the press conference is replayed to them in the coming days. Few will have watched the meandering two hours. People will hear about action items--apology, fire, responsibility. Those fit with the Christie image and with the kind of leadership that people expect from executives. ""The test of leadership is what do you do,"" said Christie, framing his actions. ""That's pretty swift action for a day's work, and that's exactly the way I'll continue to conduct myself if there's any other information surrounding this that comes up, or anything different that comes up over the course of the next four years."" There are other tests of leadership, though, including what kind of organization you run before your people get caught. That's where Christie still faces political exposure. By admitting that he didn't know anything about it, the governor admits to allowing a rogue political operation to operate underneath him. Given how cavalier these aides were about this infraction and how small the political stakes, it's hard to imagine that in bigger instances at least some other gambits weren't tried. If you are caught firing your six-shooter willy-nilly around the house at fruit flies, there's a pretty good chance you're behaving recklessly because you've become habituated to the recklessness and it isn't your first time. This offered another moment in which Christie's story seemed ripe for puncturing. He seemed confused at how on earth anything like this could be possible. That would be a hard posture for any politician to maintain, especially one with Christie's reputation for political fortitude. As this story unfolds, we'll see if this was an isolated incident that grew in a culture that was otherwise hostile to such low behavior or whether this was a part of a broader pattern. At the very least, this will complicate Christie's efforts to sell himself in the future as a hands-on manager. It will also presumably neuter him a bit. Christie will have to rein in his garden-variety toughness for fear of reanimating this story. He seemed at pains during the press conference to do nothing that would lend to the tough-guy image. He repeatedly said he was ""sad"" and said he might someday find himself angry but that he wasn't experiencing that emotion now. Message: not a tripwire vindictive fellow. Now he just has to hope that the two aides he dispatched aren't either. Or aren't in this specific case. There are also investigations to come. The U.S. attorney has launched one. Christie promised to cooperate. ""I have nothing to hide,"" he said, one of the many claims (""I am not a bully"") that will squash him if future facts come out to undermine it. If future claims don't appear or are weak, then it's possible that the story of crisis management that Christie kicked off with his press conference will start to overtake the story of rogue vindictiveness."	Christie's Press Conference Was Audacious, but if Anything He Said Turns Out to Be False, He Could Be Finished
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/01/fort_lee_traffic_scandal_chris_christie_s_2016_presidential_campaign_hangs.html	"Lots of politicians get blamed for gridlock, but few can really grab it with both mitts and own it the way Gov. Chris Christie now can. One of his top aides gave the go-ahead to shut down traffic into Fort Lee, N.J., because the town's Democratic mayor wouldn't endorse Christie's re-election bid. ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,"" wrote Bridget Anne Kelly, a deputy chief of staff in the governor's office.* Then, when the traffic was causing the predictable problems, Christie's aides appeared to delight in the fact that the ones being inconvenienced were likely to vote for Christie's opponent. The problems for Christie and his presidential ambitions are obvious. The scandal is cinematic, amusing, and repeatable, which means it won't go away. Any of Christie's opponents in 2016 can refer to it at any time. New reporters will now be assigned to the Christie dirt-digging beat. It will be a stone in Christie's shoe as he endures the already irritating process of lugging himself across the country to campaign for the nomination. The story also confirms the existing stereotype that Christie is a bully from a state known for playing rough and being ethically loose. It raises questions about just what kind of operation Christie is running and whether he can be trusted. Christie has dismissed questions about the bridge issue and said--at least before the latest revelations--that no one in his office knew about it. Also, this would appear to close off Christie's lane to the high road (sorry). How can he say things like this from now on? ""We watch a Congress at war with itself because they are unwilling to leave campaign-style politics at the Capitol's door."" This is a political problem for Christie, but more importantly, it's a leadership test. Since the governor arrived on the national stage, he has given various ad hoc seminars on leadership and the qualities required for greatness. He talks a great deal about the topic and offers himself as an expert. Before he became partners with Barack Obama in responding to Hurricane Sandy, he gave a very astringent critique of the president's shortcomings. Recently Christie advised the president to apologize for his promise that if people wanted to keep their insurance they would be allowed to. ""When you make a mistake, you should own up to it and apologize for it,"" he said. Will Christie do that here? Christie now faces problems that echo ones this president has faced, most recently in the rollout of the Affordable Care Act: Does he apologize, and how fully? Does he take responsibility for the actions of his aides? Does he admit mistakes? Does he fire someone? Does he increase his famous bluster or does he step back from it? Christie is very good at giving advice on these matters. Now he can show rather than tell. As a political matter, if Christie handles the fallout with skill, you could see voters finding their way to a rationalization. Sure, he is a little messy, but that's why he gets results! The truth of leadership is that you want a president who can be a bit of a bully. As former Defense Secretary Robert Gates says in his new memoir, President Obama and President Bush both had problems with Congress because neither was liked or feared. But that obviously only goes so far. We also don't want presidents who abuse their power. The Fort Lee emails are a classic case of that. Christie was already a lock to win his 2013 re-election race and therefore didn't really need the mayoral endorsement. If a top aide to the governor can waste public money in an act of petty vindictiveness, imagine what might happen with real power--power of the kind we have all been debating in the wake of disclosures about the NSA's ability to monitor American citizens. On the other hand, if Christie hires staffers who were dumb enough to say this kind of thing on email, perhaps general competence is the bigger worry. *Correction, Jan. 8, 2014: This post originally misstated that Bridget Anne Kelly wrote, ""Time for some traffic in Fort Lee.""

26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/01/harry_reid_s_face_the_nation_interview_the_majority_leader_went_on_the_offensive.html	"Usually people return from vacation with a lighter outlook, but after the year-end Senate break, Majority Leader Harry Reid is in a glum mood. On Sunday's Face the Nation, the Nevada senator said there was little hope that Congress would be better in 2014 than it was in 2013, a year in which the institution achieved greatness only in scoring historic approval-rating lows. ""Unless the Republicans in Congress decide they should do something for the American people, I'm sorry to say that's true,"" he said when asked if this year would be as bad as last. ""The rating in Congress is down. If somebody called me in a poll, I would vote with them. This is awful what's been going on."" Reid's remarks should dispel most of the bipartisan self-congratulation that surrounded the $85 billion end-of-the-year budget agreement between the House and the Senate. That modest achievement was heralded by some, including the president, as a possible starting point for bipartisan cooperation in 2014. Reid didn't bother trying to build on that because we are in an election year, in which control of the Senate could be in play. Whatever detours there might be from the constant state of fracas will be temporary. And the bipartisan detours won't really be detours from politics at all. Top Republican aides in both chambers say the reason that GOP members embraced the budget deal was to keep the public focus on the Affordable Care Act, which they thought was doing a good job making Democrats look bad. ""It's hard to hug someone when they're pushing you away,"" said one top GOP Senate aide in response to Reid. This year was always scheduled to be one for pushing and shoving from both parties. The president's team almost always loses seats in midterm elections. Since World War II, the average has been six seats when a president is in his sixth year, which coincidentally is the exact number Republicans need to take control of the Senate and demote Harry Reid. Seven of the seats that Democrats are defending are in states Mitt Romney carried. Six of those states are ones that Romney won by double digits. (Voters have increasingly chosen Senate candidates from the party they prefer in presidential elections.) Given these stakes, if Reid didn't push first, he was likely to be on the receiving end of a shove. In 2010 and 2012, Democrats faced similar challenges with the electoral map and won by defining their opponents as extreme early in the process and then pouncing on mistakes. Democrats can only hope for candidates as helpful as Richard Mourdock, the Indiana Senate candidate who said that even rape was something that God intended, and Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin, who said that pregnancy rarely results from ""legitimate rape.""* These remarks put the candidates and party on the defensive and allowed Democrats to rally female voters, a key part of their base. In 2012 Democrats were so successful exploiting those two men as characteristic of the Republican Party that it came up time and again in conversations I had with undecided voters weighing their presidential choice. (Obama's campaign team worked to make this happen, of course.) Replicating this success is a two-part process. First, Democrats must prepare the ground, then their candidates must shove their opponents into the hole. The two coming fights over unemployment benefits and the minimum wage are part of a larger economic fight about inequality. The policy reasons for talking about the issue are unassailable--even Republicans like Sen. Marco Rubio are talking about inequality--and these two specific measures are broadly popular. But there is also a larger strategy. Democrats are trying to define Republicans more broadly as unfeeling and uncaring agents of an extreme ideological wing. In the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, when voters were asked which party shows compassion and concern for people, 45 percent said Democrats and 17 percent said Republicans. The president in his weekly radio address on Saturday wasn't doing anything to kindle the bipartisan momentum of the end of last year. He said for Republicans to deny unemployment benefits would be ""just plain cruel."" By hitting on these issues dear to the Democratic base, the party will continue to raise lots of money, but will the message actually move voters? Democratic strategists say that individual candidates need all the help they can get, so the national effort can't hurt. But for the message to be effective, Republican candidates will have to embody the stereotype as Mitt Romney did in the famous secretly taped video of his remarks about the 47 percent of the country that would not vote for him. So you see it in press releases across the party. Alison Lundergan Grimes, who is running against Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, issued a press release Monday hitting the minority leader on his lack of support for an increase in the minimum wage. The Democratic National Committee attacked Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker for not supporting the minimum wage. ""Whose Side is Walker on?"" it asks. Update, Jan. 7: Democratic Senate candidates are also pressing the case in unison over the extension of unemployment benefits. This offensive also seeks to change the subject from the Affordable Care Act. When Reid was asked if vulnerable Democrats should run as proud sponsors of the law, he ducked. He cited some statistics about how many people had gotten coverage, but that's not enough to change negative public opinion. The voters who are most politically potent on the issue of health care are those who already have it and worry that the chaos caused by implementation of the ACA will destroy their health care. Those fears won't be fixed by a website that works. The improvement in website performance only means that Democrats have cleared a hurdle of their own making. They still have to wrestle with all of the political problems they worried about on Oct. 1, when a functioning site was supposed to launch. As Jonathan Gruber points out, an accurate assessment of the ACA won't really be possible until May when insurance companies offer their new premium estimates. Then we'll know how the program has affected the market. In the fall, we'll learn how many fewer people are uninsured. Republicans aren't going to wait for the data to come in, and the White House won't stop making grand claims about the program's success that potentially exacerbate the party's credibility problem on the issue. That means Democrats still face exposure with those voters who already have insurance and lack evidence that can reverse their worry. Until then, they need to throw punches and duck the subject they like least. Correction, Jan. 6, 2014: This article originally misspelled Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin's last name. (Return.)"	Why Sen. Harry Reid Threw the First Punch of 2014

Combing through a year's worth of articles and blog posts and typos (I left ""butb"" in a headline?) is a real jackhammer to the ego, and I needed something to feel perspicacious about. So I confidently guessed that 2013 would be marked by ""constant fiscal showdowns"" and that ""Democrats might reform the filibuster."" Hey, not bad! Neither risky nor wrong. This was a year full of good-enough, easy-10 calls, thanks in large part to a Congress and president that didn't change much after 2012. The main lesson I took from the 2012 election was that data was mostly immune to the tempests that the media obsessed over. The main lesson I took from 2011 was that the most likely outcome in any congressional negotiation or legislative push was ""nothing."" And so, Democrats undid part of the filibuster because they worried more about courts undoing their legislation than about a Senate race turning on something as obscure as cloture rules. Immigration reform and gun safety sputtered because John Boehner's Republicans saw no upside in passing them. Had I spent 2013 robotically repeating those truths, I'd have been fine. Instead, I said all this. Jan. 3: The new Congress will be more reasonable than old one. Look, I hate to invoke the Context Fairy this early, but this prediction wasn't totally wrong. The first stories about the new members of Congress focused disproportionately on the Ted Yohos and Ted Cruzes, the most ideologically rigid and most quotable. I pointed out that most of the incoming class actually had more experience than the median Class of 2010 member. ""Congress's less conservative Republicans sounded optimistic,"" I wrote--and they did! They also largely went along with the first government shutdown in 17 years. But when they collapsed, they collapsed--they went along with a budget deal that punted on the entitlement reform that the more conservative members had wanted for years. Feb. 14: Ken Cuccinelli will probably become governor of Virginia. Man cannot live on data alone. I surmised that Cuccinelli, the state's right-wing attorney general who'd alienated scores of moderates in his party, was still likely to beat Terry McAuliffe. ""The party that holds the White House typically loses the off-year elections,"" I wrote. Never do that, kids! History does not prescribe any outcome in a changing state. My less-risible argument was that an off-year election would see a drop-off on nonwhite votes, hurting the Democrats. That happened, but at a far lower rate than had happened in previous off-year races. My mind changed about Cuccinelli a few months later. He'd planned to run down McAuliffe on ethics. Gov. Bob McDonnell's unexpected gifts scandal shattered that plan; Cuccinelli never came up with a better one. As soon as the Republicans started releasing fake polls to make fun of all the surveys that showed them losing, I assumed they'd lose. Then the campaign ended, and I dramatically overestimated how much McAuliffe would win by. Oh, well. April 9: The National Rifle Association might lose the gun-safety battle. Here I made two mistakes: Falling for spin and trying too hard to rebut conventional wisdom. Anyone who looked at the makeup of the House of Representatives could have said, ""Oh, yeah, they won't buck the NRA."" But the gun lobby's initial response to the Newtown, Conn., shootings was so callous that I failed to understand the long game. So what if their ""school safety"" program was sold with a lie about Sasha and Malia Obama going to a fortified school? The NRA wanted to throttle legislation and sell more guns, and so it did. I bought in to the gun-safety movement's theory that the NRA would cede just enough ground to allow the passage of a small bill. ""The NRA represents an industry that will lose money if a ban on high capacity magazines goes through,"" I wrote, channeling and describing the Bloombergian line of thinking. In order to convince reporters that the failure of an assault-weapons ban was not a loss--that it was inevitable, a way to tee up another more popular bill--the gun-safety side gave away its strategy. Even when Ted Cruz blundered and tried to filibuster the start of debate, I should have realized that something so hobbled in a Democratic Senate wouldn't ever pass the House. That was what happened with immigration reform, and I didn't bungle that prediction. April 23: Brian Schweitzer will run for Senate and save the Democrats. Come on, this was hardly my fault. In February, the just-departed governor of Montana was pleased with a poll giving him the lead in a possible 2014 Senate race and shared the results on Facebook. Who does that? Someone who might run for Senate, that's who. When Sen. Max Baucus announced his retirement, I wrote that Schweitzer, ""the bolo-tie-and-jeans wearing pro-coal populist,"" was the favored candidate to replace him. Still true. Schweitzer shocked the party by passing on the race. July 7: Rand Paul won't fire a neo-Confederate staffer. I thought I understood the Paul family. I'd covered Ron Paul's two presidential campaigns and seen the utter contempt he had for questions about his unsavory associates. I'd talked to Rand Paul about those stories--newsletters published under the Paul name, donations from a white supremacist--and knew he agreed. ""He considers these questions preposterous because Paul knows he's not a racist,"" I wrote. ""Why do white supremacists or Southern avengers like him so much? Well, they're misled--lucky enough, they've found Paul-style libertarianism, and they will discover that color-blind politics is a far better use of their time."" All of that led me to write that Paul would retain Jack Hunter, an author whose nom de Internet (and radio) was the Southern Avenger, after the Washington Free Beacon found Hunter's old pro-Confederacy quotes. I was wrong. Hunter resigned after the controversy faded. Sep. 3: Obama can still win a vote to strike Syria. This one stings, then burns, then stings again. By happenstance, I was in London for book research when Parliament voted down a resolution that would have allowed airstrikes on Syria. The U.K. press covered the vote like a fait accompli--there were maps in the morning newspapers about likely targets--until the coalition government lost the vote. Why did I return to Washington and think it would be any different? Great question, especially because I never adequately explained how Obama could win the Senate vote. ""Give the Republicans enough room to condemn Obama,"" I suggested, ""give the Democrats enough assurances that this is a humanitarian mission--oh, be sure to compare Assad to Hitler and failure to bomb to 'appeasement,' just so the message about Israel isn't missed--and the resolution begins to look passable."" Uh-huh. Those were my biggest whiffs of the year. Some stories that I remembered getting wrong looked better when I pulled them up. Way back in July I suggested that a government shutdown wouldn't ""scare the left"" because a fight like that, over Obamacare, would squelch the ""grand bargain"" that really scared them. What do you know, it did. I only ever wrote about the Bob Menendez ""hooker"" story to make fun of its flimsiness; I wrote about the 60 Minutes report on Benghazi only to cover what Republicans would do with the ""revelations."" But why did those flawed stories run? The incentives for running with a big story are often greater than the disincentives of getting it wrong. Sure, Lara Logan was given a furlough of shame when she screwed up. But the Daily Caller editor and reporter who ran with the bogus Menendez story got headhunted for bigger jobs at Breitbart.com and the Daily Mail. And surely no pundit who said this would be the year of the Grand Bargain or immigration reform is spending this Christmas looking for new work. It's easy to make bad calls and easy to get away with it. But let's try not to do it."	What Did Dave Weigel Get Wrong in 2013?
28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/12/obama_s_mistakes_why_the_president_won_t_acknowledge_his_2013_errors.html	"Presidents aren't allowed to admit mistakes in public. So when President Obama was asked during his news conference today what mistake he had committed in the last year, he gave a mushy answer. George W. Bush had trouble with the same question. President Obama answered at greater length than Bush--580 words!--but with the same lack of substance. He talked about his health care website and how lines of communication were blurry and the procurement process wasn't very good. Those are problems, not mistakes, and certainly not mistakes he made. Politically it's understandable why presidents don't admit mistakes. Why give your enemies a weapon? They've already got plenty, and if you're candid about mistakes, you just give them a bigger one. Still, it's a shame. A central challenge for any president is whether he can accurately assess reality, recognize what is working and what isn't, and then make changes. What's tantalizing and frustrating about Obama is that he certainly appears to know that he made mistakes, he just doesn't want to tell us, or tell us what he learned from them. Obama has added more staff recently in apparent recognition that he has problems, but he won't let us in on the thinking behind the moves. Adaptation is required of any high-performing executive. If you take risks, you often fail. Trial and error is a powerful way to solve problems. To succeed you've got to be able to iterate and move on. One of the qualities for which Ben Bernanke is being heralded as he finishes his tenure at the Fed is his ability to think creatively when all options seemed foreclosed. Presidents used to be open about the certainty of failing and adapting. FDR talked about ""bold, persistent experimentation."" But presidents are encased in flattery, sycophancy, and groupthink. Most of us know when we've made a mistake; a president has lots of people trying to fool him. But at the same time, a president is criticized for every tiny thing, sometimes beyond all reason. So a president and his staff must also ignore a lot of stupid criticism or they'd never get anything done. Asked about his tough year, President Obama explained that he had his head down and he was focused. ""As long as I've got an opportunity every single day to make sure that in ways large and small I'm creating greater opportunity for people ... I'll take it."" He's grinding away despite the low poll numbers and the second-guessing. Almost every presidential decision can fail. No call is easy. This is why George W. Bush famously said he didn't look back. Every single decision can be second-guessed. But President Obama also boasted about a trait that Bush never admitted to. ""It's not that I don't engage in a lot of self-reflection here. I promise you,"" he said in response to a question by ABC's Jonathan Karl. ""I probably beat myself up, you know, even worse that you or Ed Henry does on any given day."" But if the president is engaging in that kind of self-reflection, he's not letting us in on the conclusions. His administration, which like many before it is insular and prizes loyalty, shows no particular outward signs of the persistent adaptation that might flow from self-reflection. So is the president just being coy for political reasons, or is his self-reflection actually self-delusion? When Bush wasn't able to answer whether he had made any mistakes, it was seen as a demonstration that he lacked the ability to evaluate his own performance. President Obama says he is constantly engaged in self-evaluation, but whether his findings are valid and he's putting them to good use is something we'll have to just take on faith. We'll have to wait until next year to see if anything really has changed."	Why Won't President Obama Say What Mistakes He Made in 2013?
29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/12/legal_case_against_obamacare_halbig_v_sebelius_and_state_legislatures.html	"The year that's about to end gave the Republican Party--sorry, the American people--one last desperate chance to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. All they needed to do was nix all funding for the law. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said so, and said so, and said so a few hundred more times. ""You're here because now is the single best time we have to defund Obamacare,"" he told one crowd in Dallas. ""We have, I believe, the best opportunity we will have, and possibly the last good opportunity we will have to defund Obamacare,"" he told another crowd at the Heritage Foundation's Washington, D.C. offices. As any furloughed federal worker or Grand Canyon-adjacent hotelier could tell you, a great battle ensued but the law remained intact. But what does ""last opportunity"" mean, anyway? Earlier this month, a U.S. district court heard arguments in Halbig v. Sebelius, a legal challenge to the Affordable Care Act brought by plaintiffs who live in states that didn't set up health care exchanges. It's a fairly simple argument. The Affordable Care Act stated that ""individuals who are identified by an Exchange established by the State"" would be eligible for subsidies when they bought health care. People living in the many exchange-free states were getting subsidies (and becoming subject to fines) anyway, seemingly contradicting the letter of the law. So shouldn't those states be denied the subsidies? Sure, it would devastate all the insurers expecting new customers, and it would bring down the law, but a ""state"" is a ""state."" One Halbig plaintiff is a Republican consultant, another is a Bush administration veteran, and the intent of the lawsuit is extremely hard to miss. It's also hard to find a sympathetic expert on the law who buys into the theory. ""That this is a drafting error is obvious to anyone who understands the ACA,"" wrote Washington & Lee law professor Timothy Jost two years ago. ""Section 1311 of the ACA requests the states to establish American Health Benefit Exchanges and sets out the duties of the exchanges. Section 1321 of the ACA, however, provides that if a state elects not to establish ana exchange or fails to do so, HHS must 'establish and operate' an exchange in such a state and 'take such actions as are necessary to implement' the other requirements of title I of the ACA, which includes section 1401."" See? If the state chooses not to participate, the federal government steps in to serve individuals trying to buy health insurance, subsidies and all. Easy. Unless you're a conservative who wants to scrap the Affordable Care Act, in which case Jost must be wrong, and an argument born in a contrarian Cato Institute research paper is obviously right. ""The plain text of the statute contradicts the way the Obama administration has implemented it,"" Cruz told me when I asked about Halbig. ""The law is clear that the individual mandate and the accompanying subsidies only apply if a state sets up an exchange. The Obama administration simply said, 'we're not following that part of the law. We're going to apply it without a state exchange.' In our constitutional system, if a president doesn't like a law, there's a mechanism to address that. You go to Congress, and you change the law."" Cruz wasn't in the Senate in 2009, when the Senate cobbled together the Affordable Care Act out of Heritage Foundation policy papers, long-held liberal designs, and stuff written on napkins that Max Baucus found in his office. Republicans who were around either plead unfamiliarity with the legal challenge or agree readily with the plaintiffs. ""The law is written that way, that people who live in states that are getting insurance through a federal exchange, not a state exchange--none of them are eligible,"" said Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, a medical doctor often called on by the GOP to shape anti-Obamacare messaging.* ""It's an interesting question, about when a law is passed, what it actually says, what power a president has to change it without going back to Congress."" This worries supporters of the law. Several times now, they've laughed off a legal or constitutional challenge to their work as the moonlight raving of tricorner-hat-wearing kooks. Several times, they have watched these challenges rise to high courts and impact the law. Last year's Supreme Court rulings rescued the individual mandate while allowing states to opt out of the Medicaid expansion. The result has been more than 4 million people in red America tumbling into a ""Medicaid gap."" As Alec MacGillis has reported, the Cato Institute's Michael Cannon spent much of the Obamacare era lobbying red states not to build exchanges. He wasn't alone, but he was unusually explicit: He said in May 2012 that he wanted to maximize the number of states ""in a position to drive a stake through the heart of this very bad law."" There's a heated competition over the right to wield that stake. Next year, South Carolina's Senate will probably take up the Freedom of Health Care Protection Act. Passed by the House, stalled for a while by committee, the brief law was crafted ""to render null and void certain unconstitutional laws enacted by the Congress of the United States taking control over the health insurance industry.""
