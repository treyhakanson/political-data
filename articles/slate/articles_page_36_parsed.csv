Having served as governor of Texas for an impressive three and a half terms, during which the Lone Star State thrived economically, you'd think that Perry would immediately be considered a top-tier candidate. So why isn't he being taken as seriously as Jeb Bush, a man who hasn't run for office since 2002, or Scott Walker, a governor who has accomplished far less, or Marco Rubio, a first-term senator who's never really run anything? There is a simple explanation. Basically, people think he's not very bright. But that's simply not true. Perry is extremely socially perceptive, a quality that has helped him connect with people from many different backgrounds. He's demonstrated superb political judgment, and he's proved to be a pragmatic and creative policy thinker. Though no one would mistake Perry for an intellectual, he has the kind of smarts voters should be looking for in a chief executive.  That's not to say that Perry doesn't have some convincing to do on this front. This is not Perry's first rodeo. When he last ran for president, in the 2012 cycle, he embarrassed himself rather spectacularly. Some of you will remember the time when Perry was unable to name the third of the three federal agencies he hoped to abolish as president during a debate in November 2011, and yes, that wasn't exactly an encouraging sign. There are many Perry devotees who will note that Perry had back surgery in July 2011, and that he was in awful shape throughout his short-lived presidential campaign. Who can say? What I can tell you is that apart from Perry's doomed 2012 bid, he had never lost an election in a political career that stretched back to 1985. And this is not simply because Texas is a monolithically Republican state. Perry started out his political career as a Democrat, switching parties in the late 1980s at a time when the GOP was on the rise but Texas Democrats were still more than capable of winning statewide. In 2010 he faced a serious primary challenge from U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a formidable fundraiser who ran to Perry's left, and a less serious challenge from Debra Medina, a Tea Party activist who ran to his right. In 2006 he had to navigate a tricky four-way race, during which he lost a substantial amount of support to Carole Keeton Strayhorn, a popular Republican who ran as an independent. Part of the reason Perry has been so politically successful is his willingness to embrace innovative approaches to campaigning. Sasha Issenberg, author of The Victory Lab, chronicled how the Perry campaign worked with a team of political scientists to determine the most efficient way to transform campaign spending into political support. But a bigger part of Perry's success is that, to paraphrase another Texas sage, he knows when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em. Though Perry had been involved in any number of political controversies over the course of his 14 years as governor, two of them stand out. Shortly after his 2006 re-election, Perry issued an executive order mandating that sixth-grade girls in Texas be vaccinated against the human papillomavirus--a decision that seemed unusual for a man widely seen as a social conservative. It later surfaced that Perry was close to a pharmaceutical lobbyist, Mike Toomey, who had pressed the case for the vaccine mandate. Regardless of the wisdom of the vaccine mandate itself, Perry was wise enough to abandon it within weeks, before too much political damage was done by his ostensible conflict of interest. It's not just that Perry knows when to give up on a losing cause. He also knows when to claim credit for a winning cause. You will hear many people claim that as governor, Perry led the way on criminal sentencing reform, an area where Texas has been a national leader. As Alexis Levinson of National Review reports, in 2007, state lawmakers decided to devote substantial resources to treatment programs for nonviolent offenders, with an eye toward keeping them out of prison. This effort proved successful, and Texas has continued to push the envelope on creating a more humane and effective criminal justice system. Under Perry's tenure, three prisons have been shut down as the inmate population has fallen. Yet in the years before 2007, he was very skeptical about prison reform efforts, and had to be dragged along by Republicans in the state legislature. So when Perry touts Texas' success in moving to community supervision and giving nonviolent offenders access to vocational programs, keep in mind that he's a convert. Perry has done more than just claim credit for good ideas. He's advanced a number of thought-provoking ideas himself. On higher education, for example, Perry tried to find a way to square the circle between a desire to keep tuition low at public colleges and universities and also wanting to limit the burden on taxpayers. To that end, Perry called on Texas' higher education establishment to develop a plan for a $10,000 undergraduate education. Perry's goal was not just that students wouldn't have to pay more than $10,000, but that by making better, more efficient use of new technologies, higher education institutions would deliver an education that would cost no more than that. Though Perry set an ambitious goal, his quest for a lower-cost B.A. appears to be making modest headway. Less well-known is Perry's equally ambitious 2001 call for ""binational health insurance,"" an idea that was lambasted by Rick Santorum in 2011 yet also has much to recommend it, as Kevin Williamson argued that year. Essentially, Perry made the case that health insurance plans that allowed people to purchase care on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border could drive down costs drastically, as low-cost medical providers in Mexico could outcompete their U.S. counterparts not just on cost, but also on quality. Moreover, this binational approach would generate employment opportunities in Mexico, which is not a bad thing from the perspective of those who want to give Mexicans with modest skills a good reason to remain in their native country. Half-baked? Perhaps. But when you consider how intertwined various Texas cities are with their Mexican neighbors, the idea of binational health insurance starts to make a lot of sense. On economic development, Perry created two controversial agencies, the Texas Enterprise Fund and the Texas Emerging Technology Fund, that he's used to woo employers to the state, in a decidedly un-free-market approach. One might object to Perry's embrace of industrial policy--I certainly do--but on his watch Austin has emerged as one of America's leading startup hubs, and there's no question that Perry's effort to attract tech firms big and small has been a part of its success. Granted, Perry has his faults. Having served as governor for an unusually long time, he made more than his fair share of enemies, which is a big part of why he is currently under indictment. Though Perry knows Texas extremely well, it remains to be seen if he has as strong a grasp of the federal issues he'll have to wrestle with as president. But one thing is clear: Perry is at least as qualified for the presidency as Bush, Walker, and Rubio, and we'd be foolish to discount his chances."	Rick Perry Is Not an Idiot	['Perry']	[]

According to last week's CBS News/New York Times poll, 57 percent of Americans think ""the government [should] do more to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor.'"" Even Republicans are losing faith in the free market: Fifty-three percent of them say only ""a few people at the top ... have a chance to get ahead,"" 56 percent say the wealth gap is increasing, 47 percent say it's ""a problem that needs to be addressed now,"" 62 percent say ""large corporations have too much influence,"" and 53 percent favor ""raising taxes on people earning more than $1 million per year."" If you're a Republican candidate for president, how do you deal with this grim environment? By running against business. You just have to do it in a way that Republican voters can accept. The trick is to find a trusty conservative message and turn that message into an attack on corporate America. The 2016 GOP candidates are already at work on this challenge. Here are some of the strategies they've come up with. 1. Attack big business as an ally of big government. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry is trying out this approach. Here's what he said Thursday as he announced his candidacy:"	Why Some GOP Contenders Are Attacking Big Business	['Perry']	[]

According to a new poll from CNN, the majority of Americans--52 percent--have a ""favorable"" view of Bush, versus 43 percent who still aren't keen on the former president. And while he isn't as popular as his post-presidential peers--including his father--he's in far better shape than he was during his final days in office, when most Americans disliked and disapproved of his administration. But more striking than this is his stature versus the current president, Barack Obama. In addition to their survey on Bush, CNN also finds that the 43rd president is more popular than the 44th, who is as liked (49 percent approval) as he is disliked (49 percent disapproval). Conservatives, no surprise, are thrilled. But before touting these numbers as proof of Bush's ultimate success--and Obama's clear failure--they should consider this fact of public opinion: Richard Nixon and Lyndon Johnson aside, every president becomes popular, or at least more popular, out of office. Jimmy Carter was so unpopular he faced a powerful Democratic opponent to his re-election campaign and lost the general election in a popular and electoral vote landslide. But 35 years later, his favorable/unfavorable spread is also better than Obama's. The other one-term president of the past generation, George H.W. Bush, has also recovered from his prior unpopularity. On the eve of the 1992 election, his approval rating was 43 percent. Today, 63 percent of Americans have a favorable view of the elder Bush, versus 31 percent who still aren't convinced. Likewise, Bill Clinton was popular throughout his eight years--with an average approval rating of 55 percent--and has become more popular as his tenure has moved to memory. According to Gallup, he has an average post-presidential rating of 60 percent. Put bluntly, George W. Bush's popularity isn't news, although it would be if, after seven years of a quiet post-presidency, Bush was still as hated as he was at the end of 2008. With that said, what's striking about the rehabilitation of Bush is that it's concurrent with Hillary Clinton's return from the stratosphere of public opinion. At this time four years ago--when she was chief diplomat and the 2012 election was still in the distance--Clinton was among the most popular figures in the country with a favorable rating of 60 percent. Indeed, just 31 percent of Americans held an unfavorable view of her. She was less popular in 2012, but not by much; the atmosphere was partisan, but not so much that it hurt her standing. That changed in 2013, as she slid from a 56 percent favorability rating in January to 48 percent one in December. And her numbers fell further in 2014, from a high of 50 percent to just under 47 percent at the end of the year. Her recent decline--as well as her higher unfavorables--are part of the same trend. Through 2012, less than one-third of respondents had a poor view of Hillary Clinton. By last month, the anti-Hillary crowd had grown to almost 47 percent of Americans, inching out her supporters. For the media, this reflects scandal. Between the email controversy, foreign donors, and the Clinton Foundation, the public is already weary from Hillary's baggage. At the same time, those are relatively young stories--they've only been in the news a few months. If you want to understand the broad trend of Clinton's decline, you have to look at her position: She was outside of politics. By leaving domestic politics after the 2008 election, Clinton entered a sort of post-presidency, not dissimilar to Bill Clinton's or even George W. Bush's. In public life, but out of the spotlight, she was no longer a partisan figure, which--for Democrats, Republicans, and independents alike--made her palatable. She wasn't, to borrow from the New Republic's Rebecca Traister, asking for anything. Now she is. And as she's gone from a potential candidate to a live one, her popularity has climbed down from the stratosphere. Now, she's back to where she was in 2007--a well-known and polarized politician with tremendous opposition on the right and substantial support on the left. Like Bush, her journey through public opinion has less to do with her and everything to do with her place in the political firmament. There is one difference. When he left office, Bush was genuinely unpopular, so much so that--four years later--a majority of voters still blamed him for the country's poor economic conditions. For as much as Republicans might celebrate his present standing, I'd be shocked if they asked him to campaign for the eventual nominee. Americans have warm feelings for the former president, but that sentiment wouldn't survive the scrutiny of a campaign. Clinton didn't leave on a high, but she didn't leave on a low either. When Obama claimed victory in the Democratic primary, 48 percent of Americans had a favorable view of Clinton. Which means that, with her current ratings, she's returned to her norm as a partisan figure. And it's a good one. By 2009, that 48 percent had become 50 percent as Democrats forgave and forgot the combat of the previous year. In the same way, the secret of her present decline is that it's driven by Democrats, who will return to the ""team"" as the country enters election season. Despite everything, Hillary is in good shape. If you aren't convinced, consider the reverse scenario. Imagine that the Republican Party had a former senator turned presidential candidate turned secretary of state, who at worst pulled a plurality of all voters, and who at best pulled a firm majority. Would the GOP reject her, or would they immediately embrace her standard, confident that--even with the inevitable scandals and criticism--they're still positioned for victory."

Rand Paul is forcing the most substantive debate of the Republican nominating contest so far and killing it at the same time? On Sunday night, Paul took to the Senate floor to continue his fight against the government's bulk collection of metadata. By any objective measure, he was raising important questions. The first was whether the government has gone too far in its fight against terrorists. Since Paul's a constitutional conservative who has argued this ground before, it wasn't surprising he made this case. In fact, it aligns with the central tenets of the conservative bloc of the Republican Party that believes that lawmakers should remain vigilant about ceding too much power to government. It was in keeping with William Buckley's line about conservatives being the ones who stand athwart history and yell ""stop."" So far in the Republican primary process the national security debate has been thin: Obama is weak and the proper response is strength. Whether you agree with Paul's national security positions or not, he has injected some complexity into the conversation that might force the debate into something more than a choice between ""weak"" and ""strong."" Doing so will give voters a better window into the foreign policy views the candidates actually do hold, and presumably that would help voters make a better choice. The problem for Paul is that, in a nearly half-hour-long speech on the Senate floor, his case may have been swallowed up by a claim he made near the end: ""People here in town think I'm making a huge mistake. Some of them, I think, secretly want there to be an attack on the United States so they can blame it on me."" Paul gave his opponents a chance to dismiss his arguments as nutty and to take umbrage while promoting just the worldview that Paul was trying to challenge. Immediately, he faced several charges: He was being thin-skinned (he turned a policy debate into a personal one), narcissistic (it's not all about you, senator), and finally, that he had lost his bearings in the debate, which isn't what you want in a president who will face tougher challenges than criticism from Senate colleagues.

4	4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/06/dennis_hastert_should_be_prosecuted_the_former_house_speaker_impeached_president.html	"Is Dennis Hastert being unfairly prosecuted? Hastert, the former speaker of the House, was indicted on Thursday for crimes related to something he supposedly did long ago. The indictment says that in 2010 Hastert and somebody he knew back in Illinois, described as Individual A, ""discussed past misconduct"" by Hastert against that person. According to prosecutors, Hastert agreed to pay $3.5 million ""to compensate for and conceal his prior misconduct against Individual A."" Numerous leaks suggest that the alleged misconduct was sexual and that Individual A was one of Hastert's students. But the indictment doesn't charge Hastert with any of that. Instead, it charges him with trying to cover up payments to Individual A. Count 1 says that last year, when FBI agents asked Hastert about his bank withdrawals, Hastert gave them ""false, fictitious and fraudulent"" answers by claiming he had ""kept the cash,"" when in fact he had used the money to pay Individual A. Count 2 says that after Hastert's bank asked him about some large withdrawals, Hastert withdrew nearly $1 million ""in amounts under $10,000 in separate transactions""--a tactic known as structuring--""for the purpose of evading the reporting requirements"" of U.S. banking laws. The charges for lying and structuring--but not for the underlying crime Hastert was supposedly covering up--have puzzled many people. The indictment indicates that the bank transactions attracted the attention of the IRS and FBI, and that these agencies tried to find out whether Hastert was ""using the cash ... for a criminal purpose"" and whether the transactions were related to extortion involving Hastert's ""prior positions in government."" But it turned out, according to the leaks, that the transactions weren't related to Hastert's years in office. They were related to sexual misconduct decades ago. Either the FBI couldn't prove the misconduct, or, more likely, the statute of limitations had expired. The government, having found no public corruption and no prosecutable underlying crime, could have dropped the case. Instead, it went after Hastert for the lying and structuring. This decision troubles many critics. They see the indictment as an abuse of laws that were designed to catch corrupt officeholders, tax dodgers, and major drug dealers, not to expose moral turpitude. The Wall Street Journal wonders ""why federal prosecutors are bringing charges,"" since ""lying and attempting to avoid money-laundering laws"" are considered ""relatively minor"" violations. The Federalist says laws against structuring, applied to people like Hastert by ""busybody agencies"" such as the FBI and IRS, ""violate banking privacy and are a great demonstration of over-criminalization of American life."" Noah Feldman, a Harvard law professor, objects to the government's silence about the underlying offense while it prosecutes Hastert ""on the morally mild charge of withdrawal structuring."" This weekend, on the Sunday talk shows, moderators and reporters raked the prosecution over the coals. NBC News correspondent Pete Williams called the charges against Hastert purely ""technical."" George Stephanopoulos and ABC News legal correspondent Dan Abrams challenged the government's case: Abrams: These crimes that we're talking about--lying to the FBI, and this structuring financial crime--are not crimes that are typically charged without more. Usually you charge these crimes because you're trying to bring someone down for something larger. Stephanopoulos: So, is this a form of ... celebrity prosecution? Abrams: I think this is a gotcha prosecution. I don't think if he was Dennis Higgins, as opposed to Dennis Hastert, they would have charged him here. Because once you investigate, once you realize that this isn't about drugs, this isn't about terrorism, this isn't about money laundering--they typically drop these. On Fox News, Brit Hume agreed: This is a peculiar prosecution. The alleged offense here is under a law that was designed to capture racketeering, drug money, and so forth. That's obviously not in play here. ... You have to ask this question: Were they investigating the crime? [Or] were they investigating the former speaker? The critics have a point. Lying under oath and evading transaction surveillance are derivative crimes. Usually, they're prosecuted only if the underlying offense is serious and demonstrably true. You can argue that if the core allegation hasn't been proved, or if the core issue isn't grave enough, it's cheap and abusive to proceed with prosecution based purely on derivative charges. But Hastert can't make that argument, because he made the opposite argument 17 years ago. He threw the book at President Clinton for lying about sex. Clinton's case was complex, and the allegations were different. The initial claim against him was sexual harassment of Paula Jones. But the charges on which Clinton faced possible impeachment--perjury and obstruction of justice--involved consensual sex with Monica Lewinsky. Democrats said the prosecution of Clinton, first by Independent Counsel Ken Starr and later by House Republicans, was really about sex. They complained that the perjury and obstruction charges were derivative, technical, and unworthy of impeachment. Republicans disagreed. They said derivative crimes were important, regardless of context, because no one was above the law. Hastert, who was then the House deputy majority whip, affirmed this position. On Oct. 8, 1998, he voted to authorize the House Judiciary Committee to investigate Clinton for possible impeachment. The committee must ""uncover the truth"" and ""uphold the rule of law,"" said Hastert. ""Sweeping the matter under the rug just won't work."" On Dec. 18, 1998, the day before he launched his campaign to become House speaker, Hastert announced on the House floor that he would vote to impeach Clinton on all four counts. ""The president lied under oath, obstructed justice, and abused the powers of his office in an attempt to cover up his wrongdoing,"" said Hastert. He emphasized that the president was not ""above the law."" The House impeached Clinton the next day. The Senate tried Clinton and acquitted him on Feb. 12, 1999. Hastert, the new House speaker, was unapologetic. ""Republicans in the Congress can be proud that they stood by the principles that have made this nation strong,"" Hastert declared. The first principle he cited was ""respect for the rule of law."" Sixteen years later, Hastert is in the dock for trying to sweep his own shameful past under the rug. He's charged with lying under oath and orchestrating transactions to evade justice. Does the rule of law apply to him, too? I'm sure he'd like us to forget what he said in 1998. He'd like us to give him a pass because his crimes, if true, were derivative. But there's no statute of limitations on principle."

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/05/uber_drivers_don_t_blame_the_company_for_being_attractive_to_america_s_beleaguered.html	"Uber has become the company that sophisticated thinkers on the left love to hate, with some calling for the startup, currently valued somewhere around $50 billion, to be socialized. One of the nicer things I've seen written about Uber by a lefty is Cory Doctorow's recent Boing Boing observation that while ""Uber may be rapacious, exploitative corporate scum,"" it is better in at least some respects than the crooked taxi medallion markets it is replacing--hardly a ringing endorsement. Labor activists are rallying around a lawsuit that would force Uber and Lyft, its closest competitor, to treat drivers who use their car-hailing apps not as independent contractors but as employees, a seemingly small change that would have enormous implications for the companies' business models. Granted, libertarians and conservatives tend to celebrate Uber as lustily as their lefty counterparts condemn it. But given that Uber has to win over regulators in monolithically liberal cities, that is small consolation. Not surprisingly, Uber has recently brought on a slew of politically savvy professionals like David Plouffe, the strategist who led Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, and Rachel Whetstone, who served as the global head of public policy and communications for Google, to make the case that Uber is a force for good. My guess is that neither Plouffe nor Whetstone will make the most compelling case for Uber, which is that service jobs are often pretty terrible and that even if driving on the Uber platform is terrible too, it is, at the very least, less terrible. That is not a very sexy slogan. Yet it happens to be true. What critics of Uber need to understand is that their real gripe is not with Uber. It's with larger forces that are making it extremely hard for service workers to make a good living, whether they're driving cabs, washing dishes, mowing lawns, keeping offices and homes neat and clean, or doing clerical work. Uber is not run by saints; it's a business, out to make a profit. I can see why some critics would prefer a world in which Uber took a back seat to worker-owned cooperatives. But if driving on the Uber platform weren't a more attractive option for those who choose to do it than some other way of making money (driving for an old-school taxi company or babysitting, or who knows what else), they'd be doing that other thing. And in that case, Uber would have no choice but to offer all of its drivers more favorable terms. Instead, Uber has been doing something quite different. It has been experimenting with jacking up the commission it charges casual drivers who use the car-hailing app. Early on, Uber charged a straightforward 20 percent commission, a cut that strikes many observers as scandalously high, given that Uber could easily remain profitable by charging much less. In the years since, Uber has lowered its commission in some markets, to attract new drivers, and then raised it, as new passengers have flocked to the service and Uber could credibly claim that existing drivers would still make the same amount even with the higher commission. Now Uber is testing a new fee structure in San Francisco and San Diego in which it takes a 30 percent commission for the first 20 rides, a 25 percent commission for the next 20 rides, and a 20 percent commission for every ride after that. Essentially, the company is trying to extract more from casual drivers, who pick up a few rides here and there to supplement their income, while rewarding workhorses who drive around the clock. Uber hasn't gone as far in this regard as its rival Lyft, which charges Stakhanovites who drive more than 50 hours a week precisely nothing, but it's moving in the same general direction. To Uber's critics, this decision to encourage drivers to become full-timers is yet another sign that these drivers aren't really independent contractors. Another way of looking at it, however, is that there are so many people who'd like to supplement their incomes by moonlighting as Uber drivers that Uber can charge them more and not worry all that much about having enough cars on the road. And why are there so many people who are eager to make a few extra dollars? The first and most obvious reason is that there are many people who'd prefer not to work a traditional 9-to-5 job, perhaps because they want to care for a child or an aging parent, or because they want to devote themselves to some other more fulfilling pursuit than working for the man. The second reason is that, as the economist James Bessen illustrates in his new book Learning by Doing, rapid innovation in many sectors has led to wage stagnation for ordinary workers. Take graphic designers, one of Bessen's more vivid examples. Because the technology designers use is constantly changing, designers have to learn new skills all the time. One day you're designing for print. Next you're designing for the Web, and then for mobile. The workplace is organized and reorganized every few years, if not every few months. This constant churn means that designers constantly have to upgrade their skills, even when they don't know if this or that new software platform will still be around in a year or two. Employers aren't willing to invest in the training of designers, as they're afraid that the best of their newly trained employees will jump ship. The result of all this change and uncertainty is that, according to Bessen, the median designer in 2007 was earning only a dollar more per hour than the median typographer in 1976. To be sure, there are designers who are making far more money. They're the ones who master the new technologies first, on their own time, and who then parachute in to solve tricky design problems for the clients willing to pay a premium. But the average designer feels like she's running just to stay in place. As she ages, and as her consumption needs grow as she has to provide for a family, she might find that she has to turn to, say, Uber to earn supplementary income. I realize that you might not think of moonlighting designers as your typical part-time Uber driver, but an Uber-funded study co-authored by Princeton University economist Alan Krueger found that driver-partners were more likely to have at least a college degree (47.7 percent) than workers as a whole (41.1 percent), and far more likely than taxi drivers and chauffeurs (18.8 percent). Uber appears to have determined that in many markets, the terms they offer part-time drivers are if anything too attractive, which would explain why it's tweaking its formula: It wants to see how far it can go before college kids, parents, starving artists, and other people who can't or won't drive full time on the Uber platform decide that Uber is no longer a good deal for them. Of course, there is a more benign interpretation of Uber's new approach. If Uber charged a 5 percent commission or no commission at all for even the most lackadaisical occasional drivers, you would assume that there would be many more drivers on the platform and that average driver incomes would start to fall. Or it could be that Uber believes that full-timers are just better at the job than part-timers and that they leave their customers happier. I don't know for sure. What I do know is that Uber is meeting a need not just for passengers but also for thousands of Americans who could stand to earn a bit more money. Is it Uber's fault that wage growth is sluggish and that legions of workers are looking to boost their incomes? Should Uber be blamed if it turns out that at least some workers prize flexibility so much that they're willing to pay a hefty commission to access Uber customers for just a few hours a week? Say we require that Uber and Lyft--and Instacart, TaskRabbit, and all of the other startups that make use of contingent labor--abandon the notion (some would say the pretense) that they are marketplaces that connect people who want to sell their labor to people who want to buy it. Will this suddenly make the workers who are currently taking advantage of these platforms more attractive to other employers? Will it increase employment opportunities rather than shrink them? I doubt it. So where does that leave us? If drivers on the Uber platform had better options available to them, if there were jobs that offered them higher wages and better working conditions, they'd presumably have already taken them. That means that if you're appalled by Uber, your real problem is with every other option that the drivers who use it have for earning a living--which is entirely fair. But despair over the fact that many American workers aren't commanding the wages and working conditions we'd want for them in an ideal world doesn't seem like a sound reason for shutting Uber down, or regulating it out of existence. Funnily enough, there is at least one Democratic politician who seems to understand this landscape. In a recent interview with Recode, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren argued that instead of railing against Uber for creating employment opportunities for drivers, policymakers should invest in education and infrastructure. Though I can't imagine I agree with Warren on the particulars, she deserves credit for seeing the bigger picture."

6	6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/05/peter_wehner_is_ignoring_the_obvious_democrats_haven_t_gone_as_far_left.html	"There's no question that, after almost eight years of President Obama, the Democratic Party is more liberal than it's been in a generation. Today's Democrats support same-sex marriage and marijuana legalization, favor universal health care, endorse criminal justice reform and Wall Street regulation, and want stronger action on climate change. Not only does Obama support these policies, but Hillary Clinton has launched her presidential campaign with related commitments to equal pay, family leave, comprehensive immigration reform, and an overhaul of the prison system. And facing her is pressure on her left from liberals such as Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders who want to go further. To Peter Wehner, a conservative writer and former Republican official, this is prime evidence of an ideological shift in the Democratic Party. ""Among liberals,"" he writes in the New York Times, ""it's almost universally assumed that of the two major parties, it's the Republicans who have become more extreme over the years. That's a self-flattering but false narrative."" Republicans are more conservative, he admits, but the reality is that ""in the last two decades the Democratic Party has moved substantially further to the left than the Republican Party has shifted to the right."" Some of this, says Wehner, is separate from any trend in the Democratic Party. ""In some respects, like gay rights, the nation is more liberal than it was two decades ago."" But overall, he says, it's a function of ""Obama's own ideological predilections and the coalition he built."" The upside is a liberal agenda. The downside, he argues, is political disaster. ""For demographic reasons, many Democrats believe that they are riding a tide of presidential inevitability. They may want to rethink that."" If the Democratic Party had veered sharply to the left, surpassing the GOP's turn to the right, this would be convincing--a fair and timely warning to liberal activists and left-wing agitators. The problem for Wehner, however, is that this is a Bizarro take on the state of modern American politics. Here, Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institute and Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute are helpful. ""Since the late 1970s,"" they write in It's Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American Constitutional System Collided With the New Politics of Extremism, ""Republicans have moved much more sharply in a conservative direction than did Democrats in a liberal direction."" You can see this most clearly in the ideological profile of the 112th Congress, elected in 2010. ""Nearly 80 percent of the freshmen Republicans in the 112th Congress would have been in the right wing of the party in the 111th Congress."" Mann and Ornstein aren't the only scholars to see this ""asymmetric polarization."" Using a measure of voting behavior, political scientists Keith T. Poole and Howard Rosenthal have charted polarization in Congress from 1879 to the present. Their findings are clear: Since the 1970s, Republicans in both chambers have become more conservative, more quickly than Democrats have become liberal. In fact, there's no comparison. Today's GOP is more conservative than any party formation in 100 years, versus today's Democratic Party, which is only modestly more liberal than it was during the Clinton administration. To confirm this, just look at the past six years. On the Democratic side, the main achievements of the Obama years--the stimulus package, the Affordable Care Act, tax increases, and a variety of moves on social issues and immigration--have antecedents in the Clinton years. Yes, there's been a shift to the left, but not because Democrats have jumped to the left of the field. It's because Democrats have been successful. Take health care. In key respects, the Clinton plan was more liberal than Obama's proposal. Reverse the order--have Clinton sign a health care law and have Obama have to reform it with the Affordable Care Act--and we would see the change as a rightward shift and Obama as a moderating force. On the Republican side, however, we've seen a host of crises and confrontations, driven by the conservative base and stoked by party leadership. During the 2011 debt-ceiling showdown, for instance, congressional Republicans threatened an economic disaster in return for major cuts to liberal programs. In the same vein, mainstream Republicans have embraced agendas--from Paul Ryan's budgets to ""Cut, Cap, and Balance""--that call for drastic cuts for the social safety net and major retrenchment of retirement programs. Whereas rank-and-file Democrats favor compromise to accomplish goals, rank-and-file Republicans reject it, demanding purity instead, and attacking politicians who fail to heed their doctrinaire, anti-government ideology. It's one reason why, during the 2012 Republican primary, candidates rejected tax increases out-of-hand as an almost illegitimate tool of fiscal discipline. What makes Wehner's column puzzling is that it's genuinely hard to miss evidence of this ideological distance. Just look at the parties themselves. Among Republicans, 70 percent identify as conservative. By contrast, just 43 percent of Democrats call themselves liberals. It's a substantial shift from the recent past, but nothing like the GOP's conservative supermajority. Different data, from the Pew Research Center, tells a similar story. ""Since 2004 ... the GOP ideological shift over the past decade has matched, if not exceeded, the rate at which Democrats have become more liberal."" In his preface to Rule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party, From Eisenhower to the Tea Party, historian Geoffrey Kabaservice describes the modern Republican Party as a ""uniformly ideological party unlike any that has ever existed in American history"" and a ""monolithically conservative organization"" that has silenced or co-opted ""nearly every competing strain of Republicanism from the party, to the extent that the terms 'liberal Republican' or 'moderate Republican' have practically become oxymorons."" This is true. Among the crop of 2016 Republican presidential candidates, there are no true moderates or liberals. At most, you have candidates with moderate affect and conservative policies. And so it goes for most of the party. Even now, Democrats have their Heidi Heitkamps and Joe Manchins. There are blue state Republicans, but they aren't liberals. None of this is to say Wehner can't believe that the GOP is the more mainstream party. It's just that to do so, he must blind himself to the facts, or at least ignore their conspicuous presence."

Baltimore's state's attorney Marilyn J. Mosby moved quickly in securing indictments against six police officers in the death of Freddie Gray, and her decisive action has calmed the city for now. But getting a grand jury to indict police officers is a lot easier than getting convictions at trial. That's because like any prosecutor trying to hold cops accountable, Mosby will be working on an uneven playing field. To prove her case, she won't just need sufficient evidence. She will also have to overcome a number of deep-seated structural impediments to convicting police officers of crimes--no matter how guilty they are. It's hard to prosecute cops. There are two main reasons for this: The first is the special deference that jurors, judges, and prosecutors show officers thanks to the widespread perception that they are heroic public figures valiantly trying to protect us. The second is the bevy of special laws around the country that are designed to shield police officers from the very tactics the police regularly use on ordinary suspects. For example, in most states, law enforcement officers cannot be questioned until they have been given a few days to get their stories straight. And many states have passed laws--such as Section 50-a of New York's Civil Rights Law--that are specifically designed to make it almost impossible to obtain or use at trial records of a police officer's prior brutality or misconduct. These two factors can make convicting police officers extremely difficult, and it is no accident; it is the direct result of the sustained effort by police unions to protect officers from even the most deserved discipline or prosecution. While the rules that unfairly protect the police must be changed, it is also high time to re-examine the foundation of these policies: the public perception--lovingly curated by police unions--of the very nature of police work. For the last three decades, police unions have managed to portray their members as indispensable heroes in a deadly and dangerous war. Fallen officers, like Benjamin Deen and Liquori Tate, who were shot in Mississippi on May 9, or Brian Moore, whose funeral in New York was a few days earlier, are uniformly described as heroes. One need only listen to the fife and drums, witness the squadron of NYPD helicopters flying the missing man formation, or gaze at the image of tens of thousands of white-gloved officers standing at attention to understand the profound nature of their particular brand of heroism. But as we read the heartrending newspaper coverage and weep at the pomp that attends a line-of-duty death, we can become a party to a false and dangerous narrative that does more to rend our society asunder than heal our legitimately broken hearts. That's because the story of the hero cop is also used to legitimize brutality as necessary, justify policies that favor the police, and punish anyone who dares to question police tactics or oppose the unions' agendas. Quite simply, in the years since the Sept. 11 attacks, the story of the hero cop has become so powerful and pervasive that even questioning police behavior is decried as disloyal, un-American, and dangerous. Just last week a third-grade teacher at Forest Street Elementary School in Orange, New Jersey, was lambasted for promoting ""anti-police sentiment."" Her offense: having her third-graders write get-well cards to Mumia Abu-Jamal, a man serving a life sentence for killing a police officer nearly 34 years ago. The simple display of sympathy--Jamal was recently hospitalized due to complications from diabetes--was decried by Chris Burgos, president of the State Troopers Fraternal Association of New Jersey, as ""brainwashing"" and promoting an ""anarchy driven agenda."" Richard Costello, political director for the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police, described the get-well cards as ""psychological child abuse."" Both unions demanded the teacher be fired, and the school district obeyed. The hero cop narrative is also belied by the facts. According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, police work does not crack the top-10 list of most dangerous jobs. Loggers have a fatality rate 11 times higher than cops, and sanitation workers die in the line of duty at twice the rate that police do. Yes, police officers are sometimes shot and killed, but this is a fairly rare phenomenon. Indeed, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, of the 100 officers killed in the United States in the line of duty in 2013, far more crashed their cars or were hit by cars than were shot or stabbed. In fact, if you compare the murder rate among police officers with the murder rate in several American cities, you find that it is far safer to be a NYPD officer than an average black man in Baltimore or St. Louis. Moreover, we pay our police officers handsomely in New York City. It costs taxpayers more than $8.5 billion a year to pay for the NYPD, and between salary, overtime, and the value of their benefits, the average beat cop costs the taxpayers more than $150,000 per year. That is not an argument for paying police officers less, just that we already pay these civil servants a lot more money than most people realize to do a job that is a lot less dangerous than most people imagine. We should appreciate the value and sacrifice of those who choose to serve and protect. But that appreciation should not constitute a get-out-of-jail-free card for the vast army of 800,000 people granted general arrest powers and increasingly armed with automatic weapons and armored vehicles. There are real-world harms that follow from the myths perpetuated by police unions. Arguments about the dangerous nature of police work drive the increasing militarization of police departments. The life-and-death nature of the job is used to push for extremely generous medical leave, overtime, and pay packages. Most insidious of all, the exaggerated danger and trumped-up heroism drives an us-versus-them mentality that suffuses contemporary big-city policing and bleeds into the criminal justice system, causing systemic imbalances that chronically favor the police over citizens. Together, this creates a sense of invincibility and righteousness among the police that is used to justify even outrageous behavior while simultaneously creating the perception among the public that the police are untouchable. And it is that very sense of powerlessness in the face of police misconduct that has fueled the anger that fed the fires in Ferguson and ultimately led to the burning of Baltimore. The arrest of the officers there is a fine first step. But until we stop the hagiography and replace our reverence with some reality, we will never be able to judge cops by the same standards we judge everyone else. And until that happens, the resentment that burned Baltimore will persist."	The Myth of the Hero Cop	[]	[]
8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/05/hillary_clinton_sidney_blumenthal_and_protective_bubbles_why_the_democratic.html	"Hillary Clinton spoke recently on bubbles and public life. Asked about emails sent by her longtime confidant and Clinton Foundation employee Sidney Blumenthal, the candidate said that she communicated with old friends to keep balance as secretary of state. ""I think you do have to work to make sure you're not caught in a bubble and you only hear from a certain small group of people. And I'm going to keep talking to my old friends, whoever they are."" Clinton is right: Leaders need people to give them honest advice, and those people are often not in government. But that's not the only kind of bubble that leaders encounter when they surround themselves with friends and highly loyal confidants. The other kind of bubble is a shield. Outside sources are the ones who become the ""small group of people"" who block a president off from reality. A president can't survive without a protective bubble. The job grinds you down. President Obama says he had to come to accept that there is both the Barack Obama who he recognizes in the mirror each morning and the ""Barack Obama"" who is the public figure who is attacked and used for public consumption and debate. A bubble of confidants helps maintain that healthy distinction, and when a president loses it, the hope is that they will pull him back. Or, when the importance of the office encourages pride or arrogance, a friend is the fastest way to ground a leader by reminding him of the initial values he once held. That's the way it's supposed to work. It often doesn't. Instead of protecting leaders from the excessive demands of the job, old friends and confidants collude with the leader in creating a bubble that leads to self-anesthetization. They act as enablers, encouraging a leader's weakest instincts and protecting him from honest feedback. They create systems that free a leader from some of the basic interactions and abrasions of daily governing. The problem is that those abrasions are often called ""the rules,"" set up to protect the public interest from just the kind of bubble that encourages leaders to do their own thing. In those cases, the rules act as the piercing mechanism, presumably forcing the bubble to open, which guards against self-dealing and insulation. That is the challenge the Clinton team faces on issues such as Hillary's private email server. Setting it up was an end run around the rules, and it was facilitated by keepers of the bubble in the service of maintaining the bubble. (It was set up before Hillary Clinton was an official member of the cabinet.) As Laura Meckler writes in the Wall Street Journal, when Clinton was at the State Department, aides scrutinized and sometimes blocked the release of documents requested under public-records law. When email records retained under the private server had to be turned over, the bubble kicked in again. Clinton didn't wipe her server herself, and she didn't go through all 60,000 emails making determinations about which ones to keep and which ones to discard. Her team--what in an earlier time might have been called the palace guard--facilitated this. Voters may or may not care about this kind of bubble. But whether it is a political challenge or not, it's certainly a governing one. A bubble that has been in place for so long and acts instinctively to minimize threats can wall off a president and encourage groupthink. In the most extreme cases a single mentality takes over. That leads to a shrinking of options, because the voices from the inside of the bubble rise higher in the conversation because of their longtime association with the principal. That is the charge in the case of Blumenthal's emails, whose ideas about Libya were sent through the State Department bureaucracy by Secretary Clinton. The other complexity with the Blumenthal correspondence is that he was reportedly advising a group of entrepreneurs trying to win business from the Libyan transitional government. In the wrong kind of bubble, that kind of conflict is allowed or isn't even noticed. Clinton said the Blumenthal emails were providing her with another viewpoint outside of the bureaucracy. Or those emails might have been appealing because they represented the familiar and comforting ideas that emanate from an internal echo chamber. For a candidate who has had to maintain and rely on a close ring of associates to help her manage public life for more than 20 years, Hillary Clinton faces more bubbles than perhaps anyone who has run for president before."

9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/05/the_gop_primary_is_crowded_why_are_so_many_republicans_with_no_chance_running.html	"No one will blame you if you can't keep track of the Republican presidential field. It's huge. If you count declared candidates, prospectives, and announced aspirants, you have 18 people from across the Republican ideological spectrum: Sen. Ted Cruz, Sen. Rand Paul, Sen. Marco Rubio, Sen. Lindsey Graham, Rick Santorum, Gov. Chris Christie, Gov. Bobby Jindal, Gov. John Kasich, Gov. Rick Snyder, Gov. Scott Walker, Jeb Bush, Jim Gilmore, Mike Huckabee, George Pataki, Rick Perry, Ben Carson, Donald Trump, and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. The field is so large that news networks have put limits on who can join the debates. Fox News, for example, will invite only candidates who placed in the top 10 of an average of national polls. Likewise, CNN will hold two debates: one for top-tier candidates, and one for the bottom tier. (One possible effect of this? Underdog candidates will pull every stunt they can to get onstage.) Of this gaggle of candidates, however, just three--Bush, Walker, and Rubio--are contenders. Alone among their peers, they have the cash, the elite backing, and the grassroots support needed to win the nomination. But if that's true--if just a few people have a shot at actual success--then why is the field so crowded? Why are so many Republicans--especially those who have no chance--running for president? Some of this is structural. In 2008, Sen. John McCain--the runner-up in 2000--was the ""next man in line"" for the nomination. In 2012 it was Mitt Romney, who sat through a year of one-hit wonders--Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich, and eventually Santorum--before clearing the field and taking the prize. This year is different. Santorum, the 2012 runner-up, is anathema to party elites and doesn't have a dedicated base in the Republican Party. At most, in the last primary, he was the protest vote for anti-Romney conservatives. For the first time in recent memory, there's no natural choice for the nomination. And while the front-runners--Walker, Bush, and Rubio--are strong, there's no guarantee they'll win. A presidential campaign is brutal, exhausting work. But right now, if you have the ambition, there's no reason not to try. Barring a huge change in national conditions, the eventual nominee has an even chance of winning. You might get lucky. Which brings us to the personalities in the 2016 presidential race. It's easy to see why Bush (a two-term former governor and heir to a presidential family), Walker (a two-term governor with national bona fides), and Rubio (a young, charismatic star) would run. But what about factional politicians like Cruz, Huckabee, and Paul, who appeal to modest chunks of the Republican base but don't have the broad party appeal that wins nominations? The easy answer is they think they can win. Among conservatives, Cruz is popular and influential. He led House Republicans in a politically quixotic but financially successful drive to shut down the government in opposition to Obamacare, and plays well with conservative audiences, who devour his blend of red meat and erudition. (He likes to cite philosopher John Rawls, for example). With this kind of enthusiasm for your political persona, why wouldn't you run? And to that point, in the week following his campaign announcement, Cruz raised $31 million and generated millions of social media interactions. His odds are still slim, but like other factional candidates in the past--from Barry Goldwater to George McGovern--he might strike lightning. The same goes for Paul. Among libertarian-minded Republicans, he's a phenomenon. His filibusters--of John Brennan in 2013, and most recently, of the Patriot Act--have attracted huge media attention as well as hefty fundraising from supporters. Yes, he's outside the mainstream on foreign policy for a Republican, but there's still a chance he could succeed in a primary--at the moment, he holds fourth place in national polls of the GOP presidential race. His aspirations, in other words, make sense. And if he's doomed to sit in the second tier? Then, with forceful views on surveillance and criminal justice, he can at least pull the field closer to his positions. The picture is a little different for candidates like Jindal and Christie. They're also factional--social conservatives and Northeastern moderates, respectively--but neither has a base in the GOP that isn't already occupied by one or more candidates. Still, they're two-term governors with conservative success under their belts. Why not run, especially when--in the case of Christie--you were a onetime star? What do you have to lose? Beyond ""you only live once,"" there are other reasons for these candidates--and others like them--to enter the ring. If they perform well enough, they have a chance at joining the ticket as vice president; they could make their way into the administration as a top official (this is my hunch for Graham); or, if they build a genuine following, they could turn their presidential campaign into national leadership. And then there are the vanity candidates (Trump, Cain, and Gingrich in 2012; Carson, Fiorina, and Trump again for 2016) who are running to build their visibility in the conservative ecosystem. With their campaigns, they can build new audiences and find new venues--a Fox News show or customers for a new book. It's unseemly, but it's a part of the process like any other. For us in media, this huge, colorful field is a lot of fun. For Republican Party professionals, it's a headache that--with a few bumps--could become a nightmare. In the last primary, right-wing rhetoric from marginal candidates was enough of a force to push Romney to the right, forcing him into a pose (""self-deportation"") that didn't look good in the general election. There's a great chance this could repeat itself, and give Democrats wide material for an arsenal of negative ads. At the same time, the GOP should be happy with its crowd of contestants, since if anything, this busy, crowded primary is exciting. And while excitement doesn't produce votes, it doesn't hurt either."	Why Are So Many Republicans With No Chance Running for President?	['Trump', 'Cruz', 'Romney', 'Christie', 'Rubio', 'Paul']	[]

They agree that it was a mistake. But where liberals see lies and misinformation--""America invaded Iraq because the Bush administration wanted a war,"" writes Paul Krugman--conservatives see an honest error. ""[C]learly there were mistakes as it related to faulty intelligence in the lead-up to the war and the lack of focus on security,"" said Jeb Bush in one of his four follow-ups to a now-consequential question on the Iraq war last week. ""The intelligence was clearly wrong,"" said former CEO Carly Fiorina, ""And so had we known that the intelligence was wrong, no, I would not have gone in."" Outside of the presidential race, conservative writers have tried to highlight the ""honest"" part of the mistake by emphasizing the national consensus around Saddam Hussein and weapons of mass destruction. ""Though certainly not unanimous,"" writes Matt Lewis for the Daily Caller, ""the truth is that there was a strong bipartisan consensus that Iraq had WMDs. This included President Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Al Gore, and even Nancy Pelosi."" Lewis ends there, but the intended argument is clear: You can't accuse Bush of misleading the public when everyone, independent of the administration, also believed that Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Except that you can. As Jonathan Chait notes for New York, ""misleading the public"" into a war of choice isn't mutually exclusive to having faulty intelligence, especially given the official conclusion that ""the administration repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when in reality it was unsubstantiated, contradicted, or even non-existent."" As Chait writes, ""The Bush administration was the victim of bad intelligence, but also the perpetrator. Its defense lies in pretending that those two things cannot both be the case."" And at Mother Jones, David Corn points to the long trail of evidence showing the extent to which Bush officials exaggerated existing evidence and actively deceived the public about Iraq's threat to the United States. Not only did Vice President Dick Cheney insist there was ""very clear evidence"" Hussein was developing nuclear weapons (there wasn't), but he--along with President Bush and other members of the administration--worked to link Hussein to the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. ""In November 2002,"" notes Corn, ""Bush said Saddam 'is a threat because he's dealing with Al Qaeda.' "" But there's more to this dispute than the details of the run-up to the Iraq war. Conservatives don't just want to avoid the extent to which the invasion was an active decision and not the passive result of ""faulty intelligence."" They also want to enshrine the underlying logic of the war. The argument that the Iraq war was an honest mistake from bad assessments is also an argument that the invasion was the proper response to the potential threat of a WMD-equipped Saddam. It's an endorsement of the Bush-Cheney strategy of ""preventive war."" To that point, Sen. Marco Rubio flatly states that Iraq ""was not a mistake"" because ""the president was presented with intelligence that said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, it was governed by a man who had committed atrocities in the past with weapons of mass destruction."" Hussein's brutality, in other words, was justification enough for the invasion. Likewise, in an interview with Bloomberg, Elliott Abrams--a former foreign policy adviser in the Bush administration and adviser to Rubio--said that ""the proximate cause of the invasion was the intel about WMDs."" The intelligence, in other words, compelled the invasion. Anyone else would have made the same choice. But they wouldn't have. In his speech against the Iraq war authorization bill, then-Wisconsin Sen. Russ Feingold agreed that Saddam posed ""a genuine threat, especially in the form of weapons of mass destruction,"" but didn't think this required a new war:"	The Iraq War Wasn't an Honest Mistake	['Lewis', 'Paul', 'Pelosi', 'Rubio']	[]

But, argues Daniel McGraw in Politico Magazine, it's dying. Literally. ""Since the average Republican is significantly older than the average Democrat, far more Republicans than Democrats have died since the 2012 elections,"" he writes. ""To make matters worse, the GOP is attracting fewer first-time voters. Unless the party is able to make inroads with new voters, or discover a fountain of youth, the GOP's slow demographic slide will continue election to election."" It's hard to argue the numbers of McGraw's assessment. Republican voters are disproportionately elderly, and it's safe to assume a large slice of the party's voters will die by 2016. At the same time, at least since 2008, the number of young people who become Republicans has declined from its earlier highs. Barring a major shift in the youth vote from its allegiance to the Democratic Party (young voters reject Republicans, 35 percent to 65 percent), Democrats will pick up 2 million new voters in 2016. By contrast, notes McGraw, the youth split plus the death numbers ""puts Republicans at an almost 2.5 million voter disadvantage."" There's no doubt the GOP is in a tight spot. But it's too much to argue, as McGraw does, that the party is primed for decline. For starters, the trends McGraw identifies for 2016 were also true in 2012 and 2008. In fact, for most of the last decade, it has generally been true that--with a broad, diverse coalition--Democrats have had an easier time getting and replacing voters than Republicans, who rely on a demographically narrow group of whites in both the South and the nation's interior. Nevertheless, Republicans have won two midterm elections and come close to grabbing the White House from an incumbent president. The reason it didn't had less to do with its aging base and more to do with the macroconditions of the 2012 election. The economy was just good enough to give President Obama a second term. Add higher unemployment and lower growth, however, and you're likely looking at President Romney in 2013. The same will go, in general, for 2016. For as much as Republicans are at a demographic disadvantage, it is also true that their ultimate performance depends on the fundamentals: If Obama's approval rating declines and the economy hits a snag, then voters will turn against Democrats and Republicans will recover the White House, even as they struggle to replace their core supporters. That's just how elections work; even when a party is nationally unfavored, conditions can give them a shot. And in the medium term, Republicans will begin to make up for the death rate of their most loyal supporters. Eventually, the GOP will find a working national majority, even if the country becomes as brown and liberal as some analysts project. Put differently, the real question of Republicans and elderly voters isn't if the party will die--the only time a major party ""died"" is when it was killed by sectional disputes around slavery--it's whether a future, younger Republican Party will still have a conservative movement. Right now, the GOP is a mass vehicle for ideological, small-government conservatism, which Republicans pursue across all branches of government across the entire country. Gov. Rick Scott's agenda in Florida looks a lot like Gov. Scott Walker's in Wisconsin, which in turn will influence any Republican who becomes president in 2016. And this conservatism is fueled by the older, white base of the Republican Party which disdains liberal priorities and liberal voters--from union members to immigration activists--with terrible ferocity. What happens when those voters disappear from national electorates, as they will over the next decade? And what happens if the next cohort of Republican voters--their children and grandchildren--have more liberal views on social issues and the economy? Does movement conservatism survive as the dominant ideological force in the Republican coalition? Or will new Republican voters--from young white transplants to states like Arizona to upwardly mobile Latino immigrants in Georgia--adopt and change conservatism to meet their needs? Your best bet is for the latter. Any Republican Party that drives in 2024 or 2028 is one that looks substantially different from the one that exists today. No, that doesn't mean it's a diet version of the Democrats, but that it's responding to a different set of voters than it has now. In all likelihood, it's reconciled itself to the reality of the welfare state and works to alter its shape and incentives. It's more permissive on public morality--tolerant of same-sex marriage, for instance--but still a home for more traditional voters who oppose abortion and are uncomfortable with rapid social change. Demographic trends and social movements can fracture coalitions and create new ones. But--barring catastrophe--the parties survive. The future will have a Republican Party, and it will be conservative. It just won't be the same kind of Republican Party with the same kind of conservatism."

In a conference room on Dec. 2, 2005, John Dickerson, Emily Bazelon, and David Plotz recorded their very first Political Gabfest together. As they recall, they may have huddled around a single, shared microphone. They talked about the ongoing Iraq war and the Supreme Court nomination of Samuel Alito. The Political Gabfest is almost as old as podcasting itself. On the occasion of podcasting's 10th anniversary, we asked John, Emily, and David to revisit their first podcast together. In the video below, John and Emily are in Slate's New York studio, and David's in Slate's D.C. studio. They talk about why the first Gabfest wasn't their best. Here's the full Dec. 2, 2005, podcast that the Gabfesters discuss in the video. It's the first episode of the Gabfest that features the current panelists, Emily, John, and David. (And here's the show page.) In fact, though, the Dec. 2 episode wasn't the very first episode of the Gabfest. In the fall of 2005, Andy Bowers, Slate's executive producer of podcasts, tried to recruit various writers for the show.

Barack Obama wants free community college and tax credits for child care, congressional Democrats want a $12 minimum wage, and Hillary Clinton has endorsed paid family leave. But scholars at the forefront of the inequality battle want Democrats to go even further. ""To fix the economy for average Americans,"" writes Joseph Stiglitz and his team of fellow economists in a report for the left-leaning Roosevelt Institute titled ""Rewriting the Rules: An Agenda for Growth and Shared Prosperity,"" ""we need to tackle the rules and institutions that have generated low investment, sluggish growth, and runaway incomes and wealth accumulation at the top and created a steeper hill for the rest to climb. It would be easier, politically, to push for one or two policies on which we have consensus, but that approach would be insufficient to match the severity of the problems posed by rising inequality."" In an unequal economy, they argue, it's not enough to redistribute the gains of a tiny, wealthy minority. Even with more programs--more health care, more tax credits--the shape of the economy is the same: The wealthiest individuals and corporations receive the lion's share of national income. And that's by design. ""Inequality has been a choice,"" writes Stiglitz and his team. ""Beginning in the 1970s, a wave of deliberate ideological, institutional, and legal changes began to reconfigure the marketplace. ... Get government out of the way and the creativity of the marketplace--and the ingenuity of the financial sector--would revitalize society."" Put differently, the ""deregulation"" of the 1980s and 1990s was really a ""re-regulation""--""a new set of rules for governing the economy that favors a specific set of actors."" And it failed. Labor force participation sits at a 37-year low, public and private investment is weak, and tens of millions of Americans struggle with slow growth and low wages. Greater redistribution can ameliorate these problems, but it can't solve them. For that, you need to rethink the markets themselves. You need new rules to build an economy that delivers more equal results before the government steps in to tax and spend. In short, Stiglitz and company recommend greater financial regulation--ending ""too big too fail"" and creating greater transparency in financial markets--incentives for long-term business growth (including a financial transaction tax to discourage short-term trading and ""encourage more productive long-term investment""); higher taxes on capital gains, dividends, and corporate income; and a national commitment to full employment, through public works and monetary policy. And to deliver more gains to ordinary people, they call for stronger bargaining rights and lower barriers to unionization, criminal justice reform, pay equity, health care reform (""Medicare-for-all""), and a host of new programs for children (universal pre-K, child benefits), retirees, and homeowners (a public option for mortgages). The bulk of this plan is far afield from the mainstream of the Democratic Party. Which means it runs far afield from Hillary Clinton, who stands at the center of the Democratic coalition. What's more, from the Clinton administration to her time in the Senate, Clinton has held close ties to the Wall Street wing of the Democratic Party, which favors the kind of financial deregulation that produced yawning inequality and a catastrophic economic collapse. It is one thing to push Clinton on immigration and criminal justice reform--areas where the coalition has moved to the left. It's something different, and more difficult, to push her toward a fundamental revamp of our economy and its rules. It helps, however, to have an ally. And the Roosevelt Institute has two in the form of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. Both spoke at the Tuesday event for the new report, urging Democrats--and Republicans, for that matter--to rethink their economic assumptions. ""This country is in real trouble. The game is rigged and we are running out of time,"" Warren said. ""We cannot continue to run this country for the top 10 percent."" De Blasio touted his agenda in New York City--including universal pre-K and paid sick time for all workers--but urged national action. ""We in New York are doing all we can, but we cannot complete the mission without fundamental change in federal policy,"" he said. ""There needs to be not only new debate in this country, but there needs to be a movement that will carry these ideas forward."" To that end, de Blasio took to the Capitol steps Tuesday afternoon to unveil his ""Progressive Agenda to Combat Inequality,"" a deliberate echo to the 1994 ""Contract With America"" of Newt Gingrich and the congressional GOP. ""These 13 progressive ideas,"" he said, ""will make an enormous difference for families all over this country, for everyday Americans."" Among the proposals are a minimum wage increase to $15 an hour, national paid sick and family leave, subsidized child care, and ""closing the loopholes that allow CEOs, hedge fund managers, and billionaires to avoid paying their fair share in taxes."" There's no doubt Clinton will adopt this language--to an extent, she already has. But will she adopt the policies? Will she go beyond the agenda for redistribution to embrace structural change of the American economy? The answer to this question depends on power. Is the left strong enough to budge Clinton from her ground in the corporate center of the Democratic Party? It's too early to say--the fight has just begun--but there are signs. Hours after the Roosevelt Institute unveiled its package, the Senate held a cloture vote for a bill that would give President Obama ""accelerated power to complete a major trade accord with Asia."" On this, Warren has been a strong opponent, denouncing the bill--and the accord itself--as a giveaway to corporate America. The vote failed. Warren peeled away enough Democrats to block cloture and continue debate, a blow to the president's standing. If this is a fluke, then Clinton can resist the calls from her left. But if it's a sign of the times, then liberals can look forward to a Clinton campaign that sounds a lot like them."	Hillary Clinton Wants to Champion Some Liberal Issues. But What About Inequality?

They were there to court primary voters who will winnow the presidential field next February. Judging from the speeches, it's going to be an ugly race. What the candidates are selling, and primary voters are buying, is vituperation against people who don't look, talk, or pray like the Republican base. The tone was set by an onstage focus group. The moderator, pollster Frank Luntz, handed the microphone to a woman from the audience. He asked her what she wanted from the candidates. She said she had once been a Democrat but had seen the light and switched parties. ""People are coming in this country across the borders like rats and roaches in the woodpile,"" she fumed. The audience applauded. She complained that states were registering people to vote and failing to ""check them out."" ""We've got to get control,"" she demanded. When she was done, Luntz asked the crowd: ""How many of you would vote for her for president?"" The room erupted in cheers. Most of the candidates talked about immigration. Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana, called for an end to ""hyphenated Americans."" ""We are not African Americans, we are not Asian Americans, we are not Indian Americans,"" he said. Jindal acknowledged his family's heritage but played it down. He quoted his mother: ""If I wanted to raise my children as Indians or even Indian Americans, I would have stayed in India."" Steve King, a Republican congressman from Iowa, opened the conference by insisting that there's nothing bigoted about criticizing foreigners who come to America, as long as you target illegal rather than legal immigration. But he was soon followed to the podium by former Sen. Rick Santorum, who targeted legal immigration. After alluding to the usual arguments about border security, Santorum warned the crowd:"	GOP Presidential Hopefuls Just Hinted at How Ugly Republican Politics Can Still Get	[]	[]

In most cases, U.S. law encourages them to expose wrongdoing. The Whistleblower Protection Act passed in 1989 protects ""any disclosure"" that an employee reasonably believes indicates the violation of laws or rules, ""gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, and abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety."" Edward Snowden's revelation of mass surveillance by the National Security Agency, including the bulk collection of phone records, would seem to conform to all of the criteria for whistleblowing. Did he expose violations of law? Check. Last month, a federal appeals court held that the phone records collection program was illegal. Did he reveal abuses of authority? Check. The NSA's inspector general has acknowledged dozens of incidents in which employees tracked phone calls and emails of former girlfriends, objects of romantic interest, or in one case an ""unfaithful husband."" Did he point out gross mismanagement? Check. The mere fact that Snowden was able to walk out with a treasure trove of top-secret information more or less proves the point. Did Snowden bring to light the waste of public funds? Quite possibly, check again. The government has provided no evidence that the costly program has prevented a single terrorist attack. Unfortunately for Snowden, the Whistleblower Protection Act contains a major exception: It does not apply to people who work for intelligence agencies, including the NSA. The Justice Department maintains that Snowden's actions fall under a very different kind of law, the draconian and anachronistic Espionage Act of 1917. The Whistleblower Protection Act protects you as long as you believe you are doing right in leaking information about government wrongdoing to the press--even if you are wrong. The Espionage Act treats you as a traitor even if you acted with patriotic intent, as Snowden convincingly claims to have done--and even if you are right. The chasm between the government's encouragement of some whistleblowing and its severe punishment of other whistleblowing constitutes the limbo in which Snowden finds himself. This week, he and his allies claimed moral vindication, as Congress voted to prohibit the most notorious practice he brought to light. Following recommendations made by President Barack Obama in the wake of Snowden's revelations, a coalition of Democrats and libertarian-minded Republicans that included Kentucky's Sen. Rand Paul declined to renew Section 215 of the Patriot Act. A court's secret interpretation of that provision was what allowed the government to collect bulk phone records for more than a decade. In its stead, Congress passed the equally Orwellian-sounding Freedom Act, which ends that practice. Opinions differ about how significant the changes under the new legislation really are. Snowden, writing from his Russian exile, calls it a ""historic victory."" Others argue that it merely shifts the burden of data collection to the telecom companies, a mostly symbolic change. Many other surveillance programs that threaten privacy and civil liberties were not addressed by this week's action and remain in place. But henceforth, NSA policies face limits set by elected representatives of an informed public. Thanks to Snowden, Americans know that the government is monitoring their electronic communications. Civil libertarians can object to the new policy, but they can no longer claim that it operates without the consent of the governed. Obama's legacy now includes the repudiation of the most abhorrent and illiberal policies adopted by his predecessor in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks: torture and the mass surveillance of phone records. What this week's debate did not come any closer to resolving is the status of Snowden. The Justice Department demands that he return to face criminal charges. The implicit position of the Obama administration, as well as most members of Congress, is that Snowden did the country an important service and that he should pay for it by going to prison for the rest of his life. Snowden quite reasonably refuses to return on these terms. He says he is willing to stand trial and face the consequences but wants to be able to present a public interest defense--impossible under an Espionage Act prosecution. Rather than leaving Snowden's status as a problem for his successor, Obama should make resolving his case part of his presidential legacy as well. His Justice Department could offer Snowden a plea bargain, under which he would not serve prison time in exchange for his cooperation. Or the government could charge Snowden under the standard laws covering disclosures of classified information by government officials. This would allow him to return from his Moscow purgatory and make his whistleblower defense. Snowden clearly broke the law in revealing government secrets. But he did so for valid reasons and with an outcome that now has the endorsement of both the legislative and executive branches. That is reason enough for Obama to show him mercy.

16	16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/06/hillary_clinton_speaks_out_on_voting_rights_the_democratic_frontrunner_condemns.html	"On Thursday, Hillary Clinton received the Barbara Jordan Public-Private Leadership Award at the historically black Texas Southern University in Houston. A former member of the House of Representatives, Jordan was the first black congresswoman elected from the South, the first black American to represent Texas in Congress, and a fierce advocate for the Voting Rights Act, fighting to extend its protections to minorities. It's on that latter point that Clinton, speaking in acceptance of the award, made her remarks. ""Forty years after Barbara Jordan fought to extend the Voting Rights Act, its heart has been ripped out,"" she said. ""What is happening is a sweeping effort to disempower and disenfranchise people of color, poor people, and young people from one end of our country to the other."" She continued: ""Since the Supreme Court eviscerated a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, many of the states that previously faced special scrutiny because of a history of racial discrimination have proposed and passed new laws that make it harder than ever to vote."" She's not exaggerating. Republicans pitch their voter identification and ""ballot integrity"" laws as efforts to protect the voting process. But even a quick glance shows them as transparent efforts at voter suppression. In North Carolina, for example, Republicans drastically reduced early voting, ended same-day voter registration, repealed a mandate for high school voter-registration drives, eliminated flexibility in early-voting hours, reinstated felon disenfranchisement measures, authorized vigilante poll observers, and imposed an ID requirement that excluded municipal government IDs, photo IDs issued by public assistant agencies, and student IDs. At the time, the state itself estimated that as many as 318,000 voters would lack identification to vote on Election Day. Despite this, Gov. Pat McCrory described the measures as ""common sense"" designed to ""ensure the integrity"" of the ballot box and ""provide greater equality in access to voting to North Carolinians,"" which would be accurate, if words were meaningless. Likewise, in Wisconsin, Republicans passed a strict voter-identification law that also slashed early-voting hours, a twin move that would--noted one federal judge--""deter or prevent a substantial number of the 300,000-plus registered voters who lack ID from voting"" and would disproportionately harm minority voters. And beyond laws, there are the shenanigans of local officials who implement voting rules with little oversight. ""Many of the worst offenses against the right to vote happen below the radar,"" explained Clinton, ""like when authorities shift poll locations and election dates, or scrap language assistance for non-English speaking citizens. Without the pre-clearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act, no one outside the local community is likely to ever hear about these abuses, let alone have a chance to challenge them and end them."" Overall, 21 states have put voting restrictions in place since the 2010 elections, including swing states like Florida, New Hampshire, and Virginia. Next year, in 14 of these states, those laws will be in effect for the first time. And tellingly, the prevalence of those laws has a lot to do with the demographics of the state. ""Of the 11 states with the highest African American turnout in 2008, 7 have new restrictions,"" notes the Brennan Center for Justice. ""Of the 12 states with the largest Hispanic population growth between 2000 and 2010, 9 passed laws making it harder to vote."" Clinton didn't shy away from that connection. ""It is a cruel irony, but no coincidence, that millennials--the most diverse, tolerant, and inclusive generation in American history--are now facing exclusion,"" she said, in reference to restrictions on student voting. Likewise, she explained, ""Minority voters are more likely than white voters to wait in long lines at polling places. They are also far more likely to vote in polling places with insufficient numbers of voting machines ... This kind of disparity doesn't happen by accident."" To solve these problems and make an affirmative push for voting equality, Clinton wants to take two ambitious steps. First, she wants universal and automatic voter registration, with an opt-out for voters who don't want to register. This wouldn't be difficult. As the Center for Voting and Democracy notes, a combination of federal standards and broader registration rules would quickly increase total registration. More importantly, it solves the problems we saw in the 2014 election cycle, when mass registration efforts ran into partisan opposition from state officials. Facilitated by federal, state, and local officials, universal registration would go miles toward improving civic engagement. For the second step--actual voting--Clinton wants new federal guidelines for early voting, and national opportunities for weekend and evening voting. The goal, again, is to make it as easy as possible to join the process and participate. Indeed, by just announcing her support for these measures, Clinton helps reformers in states where change is possible. These are good ideas on the merits. They're also great politics. Voting is one of the few issues where the partisan and ideological differences are easy to understand. Democrats want to expand access to the ballot, Republicans want to restrict it. It's an excellent issue for activism--look at the high number of voters who went to the polls in 2012 in defiance of voter-suppression measures--and a sturdy cudgel against your political opponents, who will have to take a stand and risk a mistake or worse. To that point, Clinton attacked Gov. Scott Walker, Rick Perry, and Jeb Bush by name--blasting each for their voter ID laws--and asked Republicans to ""stop fear-mongering"" about a ""phantom epidemic of election fraud."" Condemning Republican voter suppression, Clinton said, ""It is just wrong ... to try to prevent, undermine, and inhibit Americans' right to vote. And at a time when so many Americans have lost trust in our political system, it's the opposite of what we should be doing in our country."" Invested in voter suppression--Walker touts his ID bill to GOP audiences--Republicans will push back, attacking Clinton's plan for its size and wide federal role. But it's clear she's ready for the fight. With this issue, she's in her element: Calm, comfortable with details, and eager to argue her vision. This, in a sense, was the real beginning of the Clinton campaign, and it was effective. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."

17	17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/06/george_w_bush_and_dick_cheney_s_hawkish_ideas_have_returned_the_republican.html	"Among the first polls of 2009 was a postmortem of the Bush administration. On the eve of Barack Obama's inauguration, pollsters asked where Americans stood on the outgoing president and his deputy, Dick Cheney. With an approval rating of 22 percent, Bush was the least popular president in Gallup's seven-decade history of presidential polling. Americans no longer liked him. Yet he was still ahead of Cheney. The public loathed the vice president, who helped engineer the war in Iraq as well as the torture programs at U.S.-controlled prisons for captured enemies. At 13 percent approval, Cheney was the most unpopular politician in the country and a virtual pariah in public life. But time heals unpopularity, and six years later, both Bush and Cheney are back on the national stage. But where the former president is low-key--at most, Bush is giving private speeches and advising his brother's bid for the Republican nomination--the former vice president is unrestrained. Working with his daughter Liz Cheney through their political action committee, Keep America Safe, Cheney aims for influence. His ""overarching message,"" notes the Wall Street Journal, ""is that the U.S. needs to assert itself more on the world stage. 'We thought, looking forward to 2016, it was very important to make sure those issues were front and center in the campaign,' he said."" It's great news for Cheney, then, that he won't have to work hard. Far from marginal, Bush and Cheney's ideas and language are part of the Republican bloodstream, embraced by presidential candidates, pushed by elected officials, and on the agenda if Republicans win in 2016. To that point, the former vice president's influence is most evident in the rhetoric of the Republican field. Cheney never spoke with caveats. His language was clear, direct, and meant to scare the public into action. ""There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction,"" he declared during the runup to the Iraq war. ""There is no doubt he is amassing them to use against our friends, against our allies, against us."" Likewise, during the 2004 presidential campaign, he warned that Sen. John Kerry's election would lead to more terrorist attacks. ""It's absolutely essential that eight weeks from today, on Nov. 2nd, we make the right choice, because if we make the wrong choice then the danger is that we'll get hit again,"" he said, ""that we'll be hit in a way that will be devastating from the standpoint of the United States, and that we'll fall back into the pre-9/11 mind-set, if you will, that in fact these terrorist attacks are just criminal acts and that we are not really at war."" Today's Republicans sound the same. ""I want to be president to defeat the enemies trying to kill us, not just penalize them or criticize them or contain them, but defeat them,"" said South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham in his campaign announcement on Monday. ""Nothing matters if we aren't safe,"" declares Florida Sen. Marco Rubio on his website. ""You can't enjoy your civil liberties if you're in a coffin,"" said New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in a speech criticizing civil libertarians like Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. ""On behalf of your children and mine,"" said Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker to the audience at the South Carolina Freedom Summit, ""I want a leader that is willing to take a fight to them before they take the fight to us."" Even Jeb Bush, the moderate of the group, has adopted this language. ""ISIS ... wants to destroy Western civilization,"" he said in an interview on CBS's Face the Nation. If this were just rhetoric, it would be less jarring. But like Cheney, these candidates have plans for an aggressive, more confrontational United States. ""As president, I will use American power to oppose any violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace, or outer space,"" said Rubio in a speech on foreign policy last month. ""Russia, China, Iran, or any other nation that attempts to block global commerce will know to expect a response from my administration."" Walker wants to abandon any deal with Iran, and Bush has inched toward his brother's belligerence. Yes, there are Republicans who have struggled to turn the party away from its interventionism. Since winning election in 2010, Paul has fought to widen the Republican foreign policy debate and tilt the conversation toward nonmilitary alternatives. But it's been a losing battle. To even enter the conversation, he's had to adjust his views, signing the now-infamous letter to Iran and endorsing elements of Obama's drone policy. And his victories, like this week's blow against key sections of the Patriot Act, are largely symbolic; the law expired, but House and Senate Republicans passed a compromise bill that reinstated core provisions on Tuesday. Paul notwithstanding, the party consensus has turned back toward Cheneyism. Hawks will celebrate this development, but I'd be more circumspect. The centerpiece of the Bush/Cheney foreign policy agenda--the Iraq war--was a substantive disaster and an electoral catastrophe. Without Iraq, there is no Democratic majority in 2007, no Barack Obama in 2008, and potentially no Democratic presidency in 2009. Maybe the picture has changed and voters are ready for a more hawkish administration. But before going that route, I'd think hard about the risk. Do conservatives want the next Republican president--and vice president--to leave office as hated and disdained as the last one? Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."

18	18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/06/hillary_clinton_s_resilient_popularity_the_democratic_frontrunner_still.html	"No one, not even her strongest opponents, thinks Hillary Clinton is a weak candidate for president. The question is whether she's especially strong, or a decent option with huge risk. In the past three months there's been substantial evidence for the second possibility: There's the questions about her private email use as secretary of state; the questions over her paid speeches and financial disclosures; and the questions about her husband and the Clinton Foundation, which took foreign donations during her time in the administration. No, there's no proof of influence peddling or illegal behavior. But Clinton skeptics feel vindicated, and even Clinton allies are wary. Lost in these fears of weakness, however, is Clinton's real and enduring strength. Take the most recent poll of the presidential race, from Quinnipiac University. Within the Democratic Party, she is the favorite: Most Democrats, 57 percent, support her candidacy, compared to 15 percent for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and just 1 percent for Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. But given her long dominance over competitors--potential and otherwise--this isn't a surprise. What's actual news is the degree to which Clinton still leads her potential GOP opponents. In head-to-head match-ups with eight Republicans--Sen. Rand Paul, Sen. Marco Rubio, Gov. Chris Christie, Mike Huckabee, Jeb Bush, Gov. Scott Walker, Sen. Ted Cruz, and Donald Trump--Clinton comes out on top. And while she doesn't clear the 50 percent mark, except against Trump, she comes close, with 47 percent against Bush's 37 percent, 46 percent against Walker's 38 percent and Paul's 42 percent, and 45 percent against Rubio's 41 percent. Some of this is just name recognition. Clinton is among the most known quantities in American politics. Bush notwithstanding, you can't say the same for anyone in the Republican field, which--for early polling--means they'll look a little weaker than they will in a year, after ample time in the spotlight. Likewise, absent an election, these head-to-head polls have limited use. Without other information--economic performance or the president's approval rating--the most they do is gauge standing. But even that's significant. With this and separate polls from different pollsters, we know that Cruz and Trump are unpopular, that Rubio and Rand have real traction, and that--despite the scandals of the past few months--large pluralities of Americans would still vote for Hillary Clinton over the alternatives. Indeed, if you look at other measures of public opinion, Clinton isn't just the most popular person in the presidential field; she's the most popular person in national politics, aside from Barack Obama. Yes, her ""unfavorables"" in the HuffPost Pollster average stand at 48 percent, higher than those for Rubio, Huckabee, Walker, Cruz, and Paul. But, at 46 percent, her ""favorables"" are also higher. Millions of Americans strongly dislike the former secretary of state, but just as many like her just as much. The other way to put this is that we're not that far removed from when Clinton was a close second-place in the Democratic nomination fight, earning millions of votes and building goodwill with large swaths of the party. Of course she's popular. It's almost built-in, both from Democrats who like her as a matter of loyalty, and from voters who like her as a singular figure in American life--the first woman who could be president. (To both points, 69 percent of Democratic women and 45 percent of female independents want to see a woman elected president in their lifetimes.) Last year, Hillary Clinton was the most admired woman in the United States, an honor she also claimed in 2013. And in 2012. And in 2011. In fact, Hillary has been America's most admired woman for 18 of the 21 years she's been on the national stage, from her eight years as first lady through her Senate tenure, her first presidential campaign, and her time in the Obama administration. If you want to know why Clinton doesn't have a mainstream challenger--why Democrats like Sen. Elizabeth Warren have left the field to figures like Sanders and O'Malley--there's your answer. It isn't an endorsement of her candidacy to say that, for all her faults and problems, there's no one as well-positioned for the White House as Hillary Clinton. For Democrats who want to secure the Supreme Court and defend the Obama legacy from a hostile Congress, she's not just the only choice; she's the best one. And barring catastrophe, the party won't budge from it. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."

19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/05/sen_ron_johnson_should_love_the_lego_movie_it_stands_for_core_american_values.html	"What do you call a $60 million film from a multibillion dollar multimedia company that grossed almost half a billion dollars? If you're most moviegoers, you call it The Lego Movie, one of the surprise hits of last year. But if you're Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, you call it anti-business propaganda. Speaking to members of the Milwaukee Metropolitan Chamber of Congress on Wednesday, Johnson lamented a ""cultural attitude"" that ""government is good and business is bad,"" singling out The Lego Movie for its villain, the tyrannical Lord Business, who rules the world and enforces total, regimented conformity through his all-powerful company, the Octan Corporation. To Johnson, a millionaire who made his fortune in corporate boardrooms, this is evidence of Hollywood and the entertainment industry's anti-business climate. And in a short post on his Senate website--responding to a story from the Huffington Post on his comments--he defended his take as a ""pretty good point,"" repeating a portion of his remarks to the Milwaukee crowd. ""I actually called a gentleman, it was probably a couple months ago, that was so upset when he took his children to an animated movie, 6- and 7-year-old children, to an animated movie--and guess who the villain was. Evil Mr. Businessperson, OK? So it's insidious it's that propaganda starts very early."" He concludes, calling The Lego Movie an ""especially egregious slam on business."" Johnson's complaint boils down to the name of the villain, but there's support for the idea that The Lego Movie has anti-business themes. Lord Business controls the film's world, Bricksburg, with mindless products and a song so catchy it will ruin your life. But his ultimate plan is to freeze the world in place, so that nothing changes and he has complete control. He's opposed by our heroes, ""master builders,"" who can create anything they need out of the LEGO bricks around them, and who oppose the stifling conformity of Lord Business with their own creativity. It's not a complex message--this is a kid's movie--but it's a clear one: Corporations want everyone to be the same, and that's wrong. And yet, there's another way to read the film. The problem with Lord Business isn't that he runs a company or that he sells products; it's that he's a monopoly. There are no options, there is no choice--there's only the Octan Corporation. The heroes are anti-corporation, but pro-capitalism. They want variety and freedom and competition and a world that respects their creativity. In this read of The Lego Movie, our heroes are innovators and disrupters--the Apple Computer facing a Big Brother IBM. But that's not all. There's a final reading, more meta than the others. By the end of the film, you learn that the plot is the imagination of a boy whose father (played by Will Farrell) would rather freeze his Legos in place as official models--held together by super glue--than make them something new and original. ""Lord Business"" isn't some attack on corporations, it's how one boy is trying to understand his dad. The ultimate lesson is that there isn't a ""right"" way to play with Legos. Embrace your imagination or follow the box--everything works. It's so heartwarming that, if you aren't careful, you'll miss that it's an advertisement. And a brilliant one, from savvy executives who turned their products into advertising that droves of consumers paid to see. The text of The Lego Movie might be anti-business, but the film itself is a monument to corporate power and ingenuity. You don't have to think hard to see these themes and ideas, you just have to think. And that's Johnson's problem. He's so preoccupied with the specter of anti-business ideology that he can't see how the film is a celebration of American-style individualism, as well as a clever advertisement. Indeed, if you value free markets, there's a lot to like in The Lego Movie. (Unless you equate business with monopolistic corporations. In which case, that's a different argument.) Compare this to other films with prominent corporations: In Robocop or Alien or the Terminator series, business is amoral, reckless, and dangerous to life itself, much less creativity. To be fair to Sen. Johnson, he's just channelling the bizarre paranoia of the Wall Street Journal editorial page and other conservative outlets, which see class war and concentration camps in every mild critique of markets and business. It's one of the great, hilarious quirks of the present era. At the same time that stocks are soaring, trade is flowing, and inequality is off the charts, the richest Americans are terrified that somewhere, someone doesn't respect them."	Why Is Sen.

So were Sen. Dick Lugar, Rep. Robert K. Dornan, and Morry Taylor, because all of them were barely registering in the polls. But Keyes wouldn't take the slight without a fight. He announced that he was starting a hunger strike in protest. ""Is our crisis today a money crisis or a moral crisis?"" Mr. Keyes asked. ""Unless I am on that stage, that question will not be raised."" Keyes encouraged supporters to join his fast, which he said would not end until he received assurances that he was going to be treated fairly. (Staffers in rival GOP campaigns who did not have Mr. Keyes' interests at heart, and who considered the whole thing a stunt, found sport in trading pretend sightings of Keyes secretly breaking his fast at places like Red Lobster or the closest vending machine.) Several days later, Keyes was forcibly ejected from an Atlanta debate where he tried to gain entrance despite not being invited. ""Get your hands off me,"" he yelled as a police officer escorted him from the hall to the sound of boos. Keyes, who rarely broke above 3 percent in the polls, made a big show, but never made it into the show. That was the high water mark of a candidate throwing a tantrum for not making the cut. Several political analysts have predicted similar behavior from Republicans in response to the rules Fox and CNN announced late last week for their debates. Fox is allowing the top 10 in the polling average to participate. CNN opted for an adults and kids table; the top 10 will square off in one debate, while the others who poll above 1 percent will have their own separate debate. This decision may bring out the worst in candidates on the cusp. It isn't hard to imagine that they will engage in attention-grabbing gestures to improve their standing in the polls so that they can get on the debate stage. This is plausible, but aren't they all already trying to get attention anyway? And let's say they light their hair on fire and that leads to better poll numbers, can that be sustained? If it were that easy, wouldn't candidates light their hair on fire and become more popular and presumably ride that popularity to the nomination? Whether they engage in stupendous theatrical acts or not, candidates worried they might not make the big 10 will no doubt try to sharpen the distinctions with their opponents in ways that will improve their lot and perhaps pull down the competition. It's true that the structure rewards people with high name recognition and not the candidates grinding it out handshake-by-handshake in the primary and caucus states. That seems to put the process at odds with itself: On the one hand the primary and caucus process is designed to give voters up-close contact with candidates, but the debate rules reward the cool kids in the class. Except that there is no better system anyone has yet conceived of to handle the number of possible candidates and still hold an even barely useful examination of views. And if you're in the top 10, it's not really that exclusive a club. The best strategy for a candidate who will not make it into the top 10 is probably to put his or her marbles on the CNN debate. While it may be a little sad to be at the kids' table--called Segment A in the CNN rules--there is a way to take advantage of your lot. First, anything you say that challenges the candidates in the main debate--called Segment B and which will immediately follow the second-tier forum--will probably be discussed in that debate. It's in CNN's interest to keep the drama going between the two debates because it makes for better television. It also makes their first hour seem relevant and not just a booby prize. That wouldn't be hard for a candidate to do since it's easy to pose questions that are tough on your competitors. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who may not make the cut, has some fastballs I'm sure he could put to Sen. Rand Paul on the issue of foreign policy.* Carly Fiorina could ask questions of the senators who want to be hired for the ultimate executive position without ever having run anything. Rick Santorum has peppery things to say about how the GOP is the party of the boardroom and not the regular guy. This could also make for better debates because it might sharpen distinctions and get people talking. A candidate who makes it in the top 10 for those first few debates will try to be risk-averse, using the moment to offer platitudes and look pleasing, which is pretty much what they try to do in these early contests. So far, no GOP candidates are putting up much of a fuss about this Darwinian, survival-of-the-fittest, debate plan. In part, says one Republican Party insider, the response has been muted because no candidate wants to be considered a loser. If you immediately complain about the rules, you're admitting that you're not in the top 10 and might not be by August. It makes you kind of a pathetic figure worthy of pity but not the presidency. The model is Fiorina. She is not in the top 10, but gamely accepted the challenge to make the grade. ""I come from a world where it's all about the goals and the metrics,"" she said, ""And so if you give me a goal, I'm going to work really hard to try to meet or exceed that goal, so that's what I've got to go do now."" She's got two months and a few polling percentages to go. Correction, May 28, 2015: This article originally misspelled Sen. Lindsey Graham's first name. (Return.)"

21	21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/05/bernie_sanders_and_elizabeth_warren_are_giving_liberals_a_voice_hillary.html	"Looking at the Democratic primary as a movie, a film critic might say that Sen. Bernie Sanders is a little ""on-the-nose"" as an antagonist to Hillary Clinton. He is her reverse. Where Hillary is well-known (and to many women, an icon), he is obscure. Where she embodies the establishment, he is on its outskirts, a self-identified ""socialist"" from the liberal enclave of Burlington, Vermont. Where she gives six-figure speeches, he is among the ""poorest"" members of the Senate with a net worth of roughly $460,000. She plans to run a $2 billion campaign; he hopes to raise $50 million. And where Clinton is in the middle of the mainstream, Sanders has been an iconoclast for decades. As a House member, he co-founded the Congressional Progressive Caucus, opposed both wars in Iraq, and voted against the Patriot Act. As a senator for Vermont since 2007, he's criticized the bank bailouts, voted against Tim Geithner's nomination for Treasury Secretary, and gave a nearly nine-hour speech against a partial extension of the Bush tax cuts. Now, as a candidate in the Democratic nomination race, he's an advocate for the left wing of the party. ""I am not running against Hillary Clinton,"" he said in a recent interview with the Washington Post. Instead, he's launching a crusade--against inequality, against Wall Street, and against the ""billionaire class"" that he claims dominates American politics. ""Billionaire families are now able to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to buy the candidates of their choice,"" he says on his campaign website. ""These people own most of the economy. Now they want to own our government as well."" This is more than rhetoric. To Sanders, the economy isn't just unequal, it's rigged, with the richest Americans using their resources to tilt the board in their direction. ""Ninety-nine percent of all new income generated today goes to the top 1 percent,"" he said in a recent interview with CNBC's John Harwood. ""Top one-tenth of 1 percent owns as much as wealth as the bottom 90 percent."" To reverse this ""massive transfer of wealth"" from the middle class to the very top, Sanders wants high tax rates (""If my memory is correct, when radical socialist Dwight D. Eisenhower was president, the highest marginal tax rate was something like 90 percent"") and substantial redistribution. This agenda, and Sanders' diagnosis, has real appeal in the Democratic Party. Seventy-one percent of Democrats want high taxes to fund programs for the poor, and 37 percent blame tax and economic policies for the gap between the rich and everyone else. As for the senator himself? Of the non-Clinton candidates in the Democratic primary, he's the most popular, holding more support than Jim Webb, Martin O'Malley, and Lincoln Chafee combined. Then again, this is a bit like being the best featherweight boxer in a ring with Mike Tyson. You are going to lose, and it will be painful. Indeed, it's hard to see how Sanders and his left-wing advocacy can pull Clinton to the left when, outside of debates, she can safely ignore his campaign. The answer is twofold. First, Sanders is so distant from the Democratic establishment that he's uninterested in traditional fundraising. This makes winning impossible, but it's also an opportunity. Describing Clinton and others, Sanders told Harwood that ""when you hustle money like that ... you sit in restaurants where you're spending ... hundreds of dollars for dinner and so forth. That's the world that you're accustomed to, and that's the worldview that you adopt. ... I think that can isolate you--that type of wealth has the potential to isolate you from the reality of the world."" Sanders isn't isolated and he hasn't adopted that world. He's not beholden to it. He doesn't have to flatter the opinions of wealthy lawyers, profligate bankers, or powerful businesspeople. In turn, he's free to raise the kinds of issues--on the economy, on campaign finance--that Clinton wouldn't get from a more traditional candidate. Debates are often overrated, but don't underestimate the power of an uncomfortable question. And second, Sanders isn't the only left-wing Democrat with a pull on the presidential race. Far from running alone, he's working in tandem with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who already influenced the race by denying--but until this year, never fully disavowing--a presidential run. If Sanders is pushing at Clinton from inside the primary, than Warren--a de facto party leader for the Democratic left with her own base of money and support--is doing the same from the outside. In particular, Warren is making the case against the present economy, in terms that echo Sanders (and vice versa). ""When the top 10 percent gets 100 percent of the income growth over the course of a generation, then the America of opportunity is vanishing,"" said Warren in a recent speech at a small celebration in honor of the 25th anniversary of the American Prospect, a left-leaning magazine. (Disclosure: I worked there for three years). Warren's argument--shared by progressive leaders like New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and articulated in new work from groups like the Roosevelt Institute--is that the rules of our economy favor the wealthiest Americans and the most powerful corporations. In that environment, growth isn't enough. To fix inequality, you need to rethink those rules and recalibrate them for broad distribution of economic prosperity. And in the meantime, you also need to stop any new rules that rig the game even further. For liberals, the test of the 2016 Democratic race is whether the left needs a strong candidate to pull the establishment to its side. Sanders and Warren are promising, but there's no guarantee they can do the job. But then, that's not the only gauge for success. So far, Clinton has been silent on the economy, focusing on issues like immigration and criminal justice reform where there's broad consensus in the Democratic Party. For the likely nominee of the party, this is unacceptable. If they do anything, Sanders and Warren will challenge Clinton to give her full views on inequality and articulate a vision for the shape of the American economy. It will open up the conversation. And compared with a world where Clinton is tight-lipped on her commitments, that's a win."	Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren Are Powerful Voices for the Left	['Sanders', 'Clinton', 'Warren']	[]

How he speaks is as much a part of his message as what he says. At the Southern Republican Leadership Conference on Friday, after explaining his plan to manage the growth of entitlements, the New Jersey governor said he knows that Social Security is a ""third rail of American politics,"" but that's why he's meddling with it. ""I just grabbed it and hugged it, everybody, because that's what leadership is."" Every Republican candidate has a strong suit he thinks will get him to the presidency. Sen. Marco Rubio says he represents the future, Sen. Ted Cruz says he's the purest conservative, Sen. Rand Paul is Mr. Liberty, former Gov. Rick Perry is running on his Texas record, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is positioning himself to be the general election candidate. Christie's route to relevance will be based on the show he puts on for voters. Christie faces a steep hill to climb with Republicans. In the latest CBS News poll, 42 percent of Republicans said they would never vote for him. That's higher than any other candidate. What makes matters worse is that Christie is among the most well-known candidates in the field. That means unlike Gov. Scott Walker, who is still making a first impression with many primary-goers, voters already have opinions about Christie. As Mom told us, it's hard to get a second chance to make a first impression. Christie is trying a variety of gambits anyway, including informing voters about his record, using the word conservative a lot, and unveiling policy proposals. But all of it is less important than the way he conveys the information. Christie starts his remarks in his typical stump speech by talking about his bluntness, the product of his Irish and Italian parents. He tells the story of his mother, who instructed bluntness and truth-telling from an early age. This could be defensiveness--Jeb Bush starts by talking about his father and brother to clear the air, proclaims his love of family but also his independence, and moves on--but Christie has designed his speech and his entire performance around this bluntness. ""I didn't run for governor of New Jersey to be elected prom king,"" said Christie in New Hampshire last month. ""I'm not looking to be the most popular guy in the world. I'm looking to be the most respected one."" The message isn't just what you see is what you get, but what you see is what you want. On no issue is this clearer than national security, where Christie, like all Republican candidates, is preaching strength as the antidote to the weakness President Obama has shown. When Christie makes his strength pitch, it's not about his plan for destroying ISIS, restoring U.S. influence in Asia, or countering Vladimir Putin with a stronger NATO. It's about how he talks. ""People say lots of different things about me, but they never say that I'm misunderstood, and they never say that I'm unclear. And no one around the world will doubt the resolve of the American people, doubt our strength ... because I will say it directly, whether I'm saying it to a friend or an adversary."" In the strength in foreign policy contest, Christie hopes that showing is better than telling. Will Christie's rhetorical feats of strength work? It was working on some of the members of the audience who listened to him on Friday. ""I wasn't fond of him when I came into the room, and he changed my opinion,"" said Ben Ross, 67, of Oklahoma City. ""I didn't like the way he responded to the tragedy of Hurricane Sandy. That hit me the wrong way, but these wounds healed, based on what he said."" Dane Trout of western Oklahoma stood outside the convention hall after Bush spoke and compared the two men: ""Chris Christie had further to go with me than Jeb Bush, and he did that."" Christie's performance is pleasing to the crowd in a party craving strength after the Obama years, but the question is whether any of the conversions he performed on voters are permanent. If so, those grim poll numbers can be improved. Then he's got to find a way to get himself in front of every possible voter he can. At the end of his strong-man act, Christie returned to the story of his mother. On her deathbed she told him that because they had been frank with each other their whole lives, there was nothing left to say, and he should go back to work. Strong stuff.

24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/05/america_s_best_presidents_have_been_flip_floppers_scott_walker_and_hillary.html	"Every presidential election cycle has its designated ""flip-flopper,"" the candidate attacked for his insincerity, inauthenticity, and lack of ""resolve."" In 2004, it was Sen. John Kerry, who was famously for the Iraq war before he was against it. In 2008 and 2012, it was Mitt Romney, who went from moderate governor of liberal Massachusetts to an archconservative who hated universal health care, despite his pioneering role in making it a reality. For this election, we might see flip-floppers on both sides of the partisan divide. In the six weeks since she started her campaign, Hillary Clinton has rushed to put distance between her positions and those of her husband's administration. Where she was once tough-on-crime, she's now for criminal justice reform. And where she was once a reliable vote for banks, she's now a crusader for ""everyday Americans."" On the other side is Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who keeps running into trouble on immigration. On Tuesday, in an interview with Bret Baier on Fox News, Walker denied his shifts mattered for his relationship with voters. ""There's not a flip out there,"" Walker said. ""A flip would be someone who voted on something and did something different. I don't have any impact on immigration as a governor or former county official."" If Walker is desperate to avoid the label of flip-flopper--and it's clear he is--it's because we often disdain politicians who are too flexible on their positions and too transparent in their pragmatism. In choosing a president, voters weigh character, and politicians who switch positions--especially on big issues--tend to come up short. Throughout his 2012 campaign, Romney struggled to show his integrity, but the public never responded: Throughout the election, Romney held negative favorability ratings, and in one of the last polls of the season, just 45 percent of registered voters said the Republican nominee was ""honest and trustworthy."" Forty-seven percent disagreed. Hillary Clinton has a similar problem: In a New York Times poll, just 48 percent of respondents said she was ""honest and trustworthy,"" compared to 45 percent who disagreed. I understand the preference for firm leaders who don't budge from positions and policies. It's unsettling to think that a president (or a governor or a senator) would change her ideas or adjust her views on the basis of public opinion, political expediency, or pure opportunism. At the same time, this quality--the willingness and ability to ""flip-flop""--is a vital part of presidential leadership. The truth is that our best presidents--or at least our most successful ones--have been inveterate flip-floppers, willing to break from unpopular positions, move with political winds, and adjust to new complications. The Abraham Lincoln who assumed the Oval Office in 1861 was a moderate on slavery who opposed immediate abolition and endorsed recolonization of freed blacks under a proposed plan of compensated emancipation. By his second term, Lincoln had become an emancipationist president who embraced black soldiers and floated black voting rights. These weren't inevitable shifts. It's easy to imagine a president (say, a President William Seward) who couldn't respond to the shifting landscape of the Civil War, and who held the same course regardless of circumstances. But Lincoln, blessed with ambition, skill, and political agility, wasn't that president. He listened to public opinion, abandoned ideas when they wouldn't work, and adjusted on the fly. In other words, he flip-flopped. And he was a better president for it. You can say the same for a few of his successors. Woodrow Wilson was a flawed president whose ultimate legacy is a live question. But one potential point in his favor is the decision to enter the war in Europe after running against American involvement. American troops broke the stalemate and helped end a catastrophic war that claimed millions of European soldiers and civilians. Decades later, Ronald Reagan would reverse himself on negotiations with the Soviets, opening talks on arms control and nuclear disarmament. It's true these particular presidents weren't blowing with the wind. They were flexible, but in pursuit of concrete goals backed by serious convictions. That said, it's hard to make that judgment at the time. From the perspective of a contemporary observer, it can look like the crass ""flip-flopping"" we decry. Likewise, perceptions are strongly influenced by outcomes. If Kerry had won the 2004 election, and successfully guided the United States out of Iraq, would we assail him as unprincipled? Or would we hail his wisdom and willingness to change? Rather than malign flip-flopping, we should see it for what it is--a skill. And the best presidents can use it to further their goals or take advantage of new opportunities. The worst, by contrast, are doctrinaire and rigid--unwilling to move from positions they adopted under different circumstances, and resolute to the point of disaster. Overall, most leaders are some combination of resolute and flexible. But on the main, we should encourage the latter over the former, and not worry if we're looking at a leader's authentic self. Who cares if Walker switched positions on immigration for the sake of the conservative base? What matters is he made a public switch that Republicans can point to and, if he's elected president, use to hold him accountable. The same goes for Clinton. Whether she's sincere about her shifts is irrelevant. What counts is that she's committed to new positions in a serious way, which opens her to pressure from allies and activists. Put another way, if inauthenticity and insincerity is what it takes for Hillary Clinton to be an effective president, then I'll always take that over the alternative."

25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/05/marco_rubio_stumbles_on_iraq_war_questions_why_are_republicans_having_a.html	"Republican presidential candidates are having trouble answering hypothetical questions about what they would have done in Iraq. First Jeb Bush stumbled last week when asked, knowing what we know now, if he would have launched the same war his brother did. Then on Sunday, Sen. Marco Rubio spent the morning going around the mulberry bush with Fox's Chris Wallace. Wallace wanted Rubio to explain how he could say the Iraq war wasn't a mistake because Saddam Hussein was removed from power while also saying that knowing what he knows now he wouldn't authorize such a war. Rubio's position: It was not a mistake--and he will never repeat it. Here's the problem for Rubio. When you are asked if the war was a mistake and you cite the removal of Hussein, you appear to be making a judgment about the entire war and its costs. You are echoing Dick Cheney. Yes, the amount and kind of weapons of mass destruction that served as the rationale for war turned out not to exist, but deposing the Iraqi dictator made it worth the effort. If that's Rubio's view of regime change that tells us something about how he thinks about the world and America's place in it. It also warrants asking the underlying hypothetical question (and probably a number of follow-up questions, too). Rubio told Wallace the war was not a mistake because Bush made the best call at the time based on the available evidence. His first answer rendered a final verdict on the war; it was worth it to remove Hussein. The second one asks us to travel back to 2003 and render a verdict before the bombs started falling. These are two different answers the candidate is trying to treat as the same. The narrow lane that Rubio is trying to manage here is that he doesn't want to say that the war was a mistake. That's politically toxic because it puts a firmly negative judgment on a foreign policy worldview Rubio largely shares. More important, it suggests that the men and women who died in that war died in vain. This is the same lane Hillary Clinton tried to navigate during the 2008 campaign when she backed away from her vote authorizing the war, but refused to call that vote a mistake. She said she didn't want to use that word while combat operations were still taking place. Many Democrats believe this equivocation cost her the nomination that year. To avoid danger, Rubio and others argue that the reason the war was not a mistake is that George Bush made the right call based on the information he had at the time. This position puts them on more defensible political ground. Seventy percent of the country may think the Iraq war wasn't worth it now, but a lot of them thought the war was worth it in the spring of 2003, when more than 70 percent of the country supported the war. But even if you thought you were right in the first place, if your decision turns out to be wrong, then that is commonly called a mistake. That's ultimately what Clinton concluded when she finally admitted in her book Hard Choices that her vote was a mistake. ""I thought I had acted in good faith and made the best decision I could with the information I had. And I wasn't alone in getting it wrong,"" Clinton wrote. ""But I still got it wrong. Plain and simple."" This is what was always so powerful about Ronald Reagan's distinction about liberals: Their hearts were in the right place, but that didn't make them right when their choices led to bad outcomes. ""It's not that our liberal friends are ignorant,"" he said in his famous 1964 Time for Choosing speech, ""it is that they know so much that isn't so."" That is also the foundation of Republican critiques of the Obama administration on everything from misreading the Arab Spring to underestimating the growth of ISIS. The president may have thought he knew what he was doing but he was wrong. Former CIA deputy director Michael Morrell says as much in his new book about the Arab Spring:"	Why Can't Republicans Call the Iraq War a Mistake?	['Rubio', 'Clinton', 'Obama']	[]
26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/05/whites_prefer_to_live_with_whites_why_integrating_america_s_neighborhoods.html	"There's no question that white Americans prefer white neighborhoods. As I noted in a Wednesday column, ""20 percent of whites said their ideal neighborhood was all white ... [a]nd only 25 percent of white respondents said they would live in a neighborhood where one-half of their neighbors were black."" At the same time, this polling doesn't tell us why. I implied prejudice, but there are other options. It could be ethnocentrism--positive feelings about your racial compatriots. Or it could be a class difference, where whites avoid black neighbors--and black neighborhoods--out of real or perceived differences in the quality of homes, schools, services, and amenities. And if so, there's a related question: Do blacks act similarly, avoiding black or significantly black neighborhoods for the same reason? Because of our egalitarian norms and the real wealth and income differences between blacks and whites, it's easy to conclude that white preference for white neighborhoods is a kind of class discrimination, which we can fix through active, interventionist policy. But in this situation, the answer we might want isn't the one that's true. For white homebuyers, race matters, and not just as a proxy for class. The main vehicles for this finding are a series of experiments from Maria Krysan, a sociologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago. In more than a decade's worth of studies, Krysan and her collaborators have looked at the relationships among neighborhood desirability, class, and race, drawing from surveys and interviews with whites, blacks, and other groups. In one experiment Krysan and her researchers developed 13 videos showing five neighborhoods of different social class levels: lower working class, upper working class, blemished middle class, unblemished middle class, and upper middle class. Participants would infer the wealth and income of neighborhoods in the short videos by aesthetic qualities: the size of the lots, the conditions of the homes, and so on. A blemished middle-class neighborhood would have homes with overgrown yards and boarded-up garages, while an unblemished one would have neither. In addition to class characteristics, Krysan also added people. For four of the five neighborhoods--the fifth was empty, as a control--researchers made three variations. Each one had a different racial composition. In one version of the upper-middle-class video, the residents were white. In another they were black. And in another there was a mix. They would wear the same kinds of clothes and do the same kinds of activities. In private, participants would watch the videos--with random assignments for the racial composition--and then rate them in terms of home costs, property upkeep, safety, future property values, and school quality. For all participants, white and black, class mattered. The wealthier the neighborhood--as inferred by characteristics--the higher the rank. But for whites race was a major influence. ""Whites who saw an all-White neighborhood ranked the neighborhood significantly more positively than Whites who saw the identical neighborhood with all Black residents,"" writes Krysan. And in turn mixed neighborhoods had higher ratings than black ones but lower ratings than the all-white alternatives. This was true in every neighborhood across every dimension other than property upkeep. If whites saw blacks in the unblemished middle-class neighborhood, for example, they assumed more crime and worse schools than if it were all-white. (Indeed, a 2001 study from sociologists Lincoln Quillian and Devah Pager found that reports of crime and disorder increase with the proportion of black residents in a neighborhood even after you control for the actual levels of crime and disorder.) An earlier experiment using real-life cities had similar results. Researchers asked respondents in four metropolitan areas--Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, and Los Angeles--to rate 23 communities of different incomes, social characteristics, and racial compositions. Again, class matters, but so does race. With more blacks came a lower rating, even when the neighborhood was prosperous. As for ethnocentrism? In a study of whites who flee, Krysan found that negative stereotypes--and not pro-white feelings--were the ""strongest predictor of white-flight attitudes."" The more people believe that blacks will bring crime and poverty, the more likely they are to leave when black families arrive. Race matters for blacks too, just in different ways. Blacks aren't averse to black neighbors. In another similar video experiment, blacks gave their highest ratings to mixed-race neighborhoods, followed by black neighborhoods, and ending with white ones. Fear shaped these feelings. For all-black neighborhoods it was fear of official neglect from authorities and elected officials. For all-white ones it was fear of discrimination and unfair treatment from neighbors and others. And while Latinos aren't the focus in this work, other research finds that ""whites prefer living with Latinos over African Americans ... [and] Latinos prefer neighborhoods with both a significant proportion of Latinos and whites,"" although they prefer integration into all-white areas to integration with black Americans. What does this all mean? As it stands, segregation is still the rule. And whites in particular live in mostly white neighborhoods, with little if any movement into significantly or even predominantly black areas. If this preference is a proxy for class--if whites don't oppose black neighbors, just the conditions of black neighborhoods--then integration becomes an easier task: Improve mixed-race and predominantly black neighborhoods--enhancing schools and services--and you attract white buyers, increasing diversity and breaking down our walls of separation. But to a good degree, this preference is prejudice--a function of anti-black stigma. In which case greater integration--and greater racial equality--is even further away than it looks."

Most desired were the old American stock of Anglo-Saxons and Northern Europeans--English, Germans, Scots, Irish, and Scandinavians--followed by Northern Italians, Czechoslovakians, Polish, Lithuanians, Greeks, ""Russian Jews of the lower class,"" South Italians, and at the bottom of the list, ""Negroes and Mexicans."" Hoyt, as chief economist of the Federal Housing Authority, wanted to improve the accuracy of real-estate appraisals so that an affiliated agency--the Home Owner' Loan Corporation, established by the Home Owners' Refinancing Act of 1933--could standardize the process for making mortgage loans, avoid undue risks, and bail out homeowners who lost their homes in the economic crash. Working with Hoyt at the FHA, the HOLC would map cities and divide neighborhoods into various risk categories that were based on his ethnic hierarchy and coded accordingly. A ""green"" neighborhood was white, affluent, Anglo-Saxon, and appropriately Protestant. A ""blue"" one had less desirable whites--Jews, Irish, and Italians--but was stable and upwardly mobile. A ""yellow"" one had undesirable, often working-class whites, and a ""red"" one was predominantly black or Mexican, regardless of wealth or class. And in these ""redlined"" areas, loans were either expensive or nonexistent, forcing families to rely on speculators and private sales by unscrupulous homeowners. For whites, there was some flexibility. Journalist Antero Pietila gives a short biography of Hoyt in Not in My Neighborhood: How Bigotry Shaped a Great American City. As he notes, ""Hoyt allowed that many whites on the lower rungs could become less objectionable once they 'conform to the American standard of living.' "" By contrast, blacks and Mexicans had no chance of overcoming 'the opinion or prejudice' of the real estate market, even though such bigotry 'may have no reasonable basis.' That was just the way real estate operated, he wrote. ""If the entrance of a colored family into a white neighborhood causes a general exodus of white people, such dislikes are reflected in property values."" (Emphasis added.) On Tuesday, New York magazine shined light on ""the grim, racist methods of one Brooklyn landlord,"" a developer who does most of his business in gentrifying neighborhoods like Bushwick, Bedford-Stuyvesant, and Crown Heights. As a landlord, he explains, he works hard to get black people out of his buildings. ""Everyone wants them to leave, not because we don't like them, it's just they're messing up--they bring everything down. Not all of them."" He continues: ""If there's a black tenant in the house--in every building we have, I put in white tenants. They want to know if black people are going to be living there. So sometimes we have 10 apartments and everything is white, and then all of the sudden one tenant comes in with one black roommate, and they don't like it. They see black people and get all riled up, they call me: 'We're not paying that much money to have black people live in the building.' "" This is obviously racist, but it's also unsurprising. As the Hoyt story shows, this discrimination is in the DNA of American real estate. For most of the last century, lenders and brokers--including national realtor organizations--used race as a proxy for neighborhood value. ""Appraisal manuals,"" writes Pietila, ""continued to repeat Hoyt's hierarchy until the 1960s ... implying that the groups lowest on the ladder were detrimental to housing values."" These manuals also pushed realtors and homeowners to use private agreements--called covenants--that forbade sale to ""undesirable"" neighbors. Housing discrimination is illegal, and most Americans express egalitarian beliefs on race. But while unused and largely forgotten, Hoyt's hierarchy retains its symbolic force in housing markets, albeit in diminished and simplified form. Indeed, real-estate racism helps illustrate the extent to which culture is built by institutions and individuals, in interactions that reflect on each other. These institutions, private and public, didn't cause racism in housing markets, but they gave it official sanction, which--over time--influenced how individuals understood the value of their homes and neighborhoods. A white neighborhood was a good one; a black neighborhood, a bad one. We see this in public opinion. Twenty-eight percent of whites support an individual homeowner's right to discriminate on the basis of race when selling a home, note researchers in their analysis of the General Social Survey, a long-running study that measures Americans' attitudes on a wide range of topics. Likewise, when asked in 2008, 20 percent of whites said their ideal neighborhood was all white, 25 percent said it had no blacks, and 33 percent said it had neither Hispanics nor Asians. And only 25 percent of white respondents said they would live in a neighborhood where one-half of their neighbors were black. We see it in the actions of landlords and real-estate agents. Compared to whites, according to a 2013 study from the Urban Institute and Department of Housing and Urban Development, black renters learned about 11 percent fewer rental units and black homebuyers were shown roughly 20 percent fewer homes; Asian renters learned about 7 percent fewer properties, while Asian homebuyers also learned about 20 percent fewer homes; and Latino renters learned about 12 percent fewer units. (There was no difference in the treatment of Latino homebuyers.) As NPR points out in its analysis, this wasn't a regional problem: Researchers ran their experiment in 28 different metropolitan regions, with similar results. Finally, we see it in the financial penalty that accrues to middle-class blacks who live in predominantly black, middle-class neighborhoods. Here's how the Washington Post describes the phenomenon, writing about the largely black Prince George's County, Maryland. ""Most whites live in largely white neighborhoods, where homes often prove to be a better investment because people of all races want to live there. Predominantly black communities tend to attract a narrower group of mainly black buyers, dampening demand and prices, they say."" For wealthy blacks who bought into Prince George's County for the comfort they felt in a mostly black community, that ""meant their home brought them less wealth than if they had purchased elsewhere."" Put differently, they suffered a kind of tax that reflects the stigma associated with blackness, independent of wealth or status. It doesn't matter how rich the inhabitants are. If a neighborhood is black, other groups don't want to live there, hurting the value. And on the other end, while we tend to associate gentrification with poor minority neighborhoods, the reality is a little different. According to a Harvard study on Chicago neighborhoods, full gentrification only happened in low-income neighborhoods with substantial white populations, 35 percent. If there's an equally substantial black population, around 40 percent, the process either slowed, or stopped altogether. Don't fool yourself into thinking the Brooklyn landlord is a New York problem. He is just a dramatic example of a dynamic that happens in neighborhoods across the country, in subtle, often imperceptible ways. Realtors discourage black and brown buyers; lenders charge higher rates to them; and towns use exclusionary zoning to block subsidized housing and multifamily dwellings, excluding huge groups of low-income people (and not just minorities). Despite the laws we pass and the values we say we have, discrimination is part and parcel of how Americans do housing. It's how it was 100 years ago, and it's how it is now."

It's not clear. When he's asked about it, he is quick to note that it's an issue where people won't find much daylight between him and his brother George W. Bush. ""Just for the news flash to the world, if they're trying to find places where there's big space between me and my brother, this might not be one of those,"" he told Megyn Kelly, the Fox News host. There's no evidence that was what Kelly was going after, but there is an endless obsession with measuring him relative to his brother and father, so he's naturally wary. But he's also trying to twist any questions about his brother's foreign policy legacy in Iraq into gotcha journalism (see Mark Leibovich), making inquiries into the topic seem like a low-rent effort to sow filial discord. The implication is that if it weren't for that media fixation, there wouldn't be so much poking around on where he stands on Iraq. That's obviously not the case. Or it shouldn't be anyway. Iraq and what went right and wrong are a part of any intelligent conversation about America's foreign policy posture, particularly the posture as Republicans see it. Republicans in the main believe that President Obama has been weak. GOP presidential candidates promise they will be strong. If Obama is at the weak end of the continuum, then George W. Bush's actions in Iraq and Afghanistan represent the opposite--resolute strength and risk-taking. So where do the various 2016 candidates fit on that continuum? That requires a thorough discussion of Obama's foreign policy--and also the policy he inherited. These are the events that give shape and details to abstract discussions. We could allow ourselves to use vague words like weak and strong about the largest military intervention America has launched since the Vietnam War, but then we'd just blunder forward. So it's in everyone's interest to get specific, especially since we're going to spend so much time together in this presidential campaign. It's hard to know what Bush believes not just because he doesn't seem to want to talk about Iraq, but when he does, it's confusing. Knowing what he knows now, would Jeb Bush approve of the Iraq war? This is the question he was asked by Megyn Kelly. He seemed to answer a different one. Bush said, ""I would,"" but then went on to say, ""So would Hillary Clinton, by the way."" That's not quite right. Clinton would not. She has said that given what transpired after giving President Bush the power to go to war, she would not give him the authority again to wage it. She's said her vote was wrong. This raises questions about her judgment that she'll have to answer. Jeb Bush's answer suggested that perhaps he heard a different question than the one he was asked. He seemed to think he was asked to answer what he would have done in 2003 before the invasion. (A request for clarification from the campaign on Monday did not bring clarity, which suggests that the former governor will be revising and extending his remarks.) So which does Bush believe? If there is no distance between Jeb and his brother, then he believes that the decision to invade was ""the right decision,"" given all that has happened. That raises political and policy questions. First, the political one: What are voters going to think about this position given that the war's costs have been so high--nearly 4,500 Americans dead and 32,000 injured--and the promises of the invasion--a cache of weapons of mass destruction and democracy-spreading through the region--did not materialize. Laura Ingraham, a conservative who is no Jeb Bush fan, found the claim outlandish. ""You can't still think that going into Iraq, now, as a sane human being, was the right thing to do,"" Ingraham said on her radio show in response to Bush's remarks. In a recent piece in National Review, Jim Geraghty asked the question, ""Regardless of how you feel about George W. Bush, the pre-war intelligence, Michael Moore and the anti-war left, or the opportunistic flip-floppers like Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, is there anyone who would argue that the price America paid in its battle in Iraq was NOT too high?"" In June of last year, a CBS News/New York Times poll found that only 18 percent of the country thought that the Iraq war was worth the cost. So a candidate who holds that view would seem to have some explaining to do if he is to convince voters that he should be the next commander in chief. Given what we know now, if Jeb Bush believes that he would not have authorized the war, then he will find himself at odds with members of his brother's administration, such as Dick Cheney and Karl Rove, who say America should be proud of removing Saddam Hussein from power. In other words, that the war was still worth it. If Jeb Bush has a different view, then he'll be asked if the war was a mistake. Bush may want to put it in the category that Hillary Clinton now puts her own war vote: an error made in good faith.  Though unlike Clinton, Bush doesn't have to defend whether he did his homework before making that mistake. But let's leave aside the topography of views. As a policy matter, the Iraq war and a candidate's position on it raises a host of important questions. Bush has said in deflecting questions about Iraq that he doesn't want to relitigate the past. But explaining what we've learned from the past and how we understand it is central to human experience; it's not some gotcha question. Also, as a practical matter, Republicans don't want to treat the past as off limits; doing so would rob them of an iconic example of strength from the past: Ronald Reagan's treatment of the Soviet Union. Republicans also have an interest in maintaining conversations about U.S. obligations to countries where we have had a hand in blowing things up. That's in part what justifies rigorous questioning of Clinton and the misadventure in Libya that led to the Benghazi attacks. The country is a mess. The former secretary of state should explain why it is and why that outcome wasn't inevitable given U.S. policy. Candidates collude to avoid the type of hypothetical questions they must rigorously engage once they take office. When they go on foreign trips organized by their campaign staffs, they only learn things that affirm their existing beliefs, which is what happened when Obama, then a senator, went to Iraq in 2008. So there is a conspiracy among all politicians to show us very little about their thinking on foreign affairs. Questions about history are all we have to go on to investigate how a candidate understands the relationship between action and consequence. The U.S. military has studied the last decade of war and found 11 enduring lessons. What does the Iraq war tell Jeb Bush or any presidential candidate about the limits of U.S. military power, the possibility of nation-building in the Middle East, or our ability to predict outcomes when large-scale operations are launched? What does it teach about the limits of U.S. popular support for a process that certainly will last longer than civilian patience, and what doctrine should emerge from these lessons that guides the United States in the future? The Bush brothers agree that the security vacuum in Iraq after the invasion created the conditions that led to destabilization. How did that happen? Didn't people predict that might happen before the invasion was launched? Why weren't they listened to? Where did the process break down? It is possible that after doing a careful assessment one could conclude that the United States should never have gone to war in Iraq in 2003 and should not have withdrawn from Iraq in 2011. Arguing that position or any position that seemed the product of hard thinking would inform a lot of voters about a candidate's worldview. Then voters would know what to expect if that candidate ever gave one of those grim addresses from the Oval Office explaining the rationale for the next U.S. military action. If we knew what the men and women seeking the presidency really thought, then there'd be no gotcha questions left to ask. Read more of Slate's coverage of Jeb Bush and the 2016 campaign."

29	29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/05/jeb_bush_is_embracing_his_brother_s_invasion_of_iraq_while_hillary_clinton.html	"Hillary Clinton is sprinting away from Bill. In the short month since she's been an official candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, she's renounced his criminal justice policies--pledging an end to the ""era of mass incarceration"" her husband helped usher--and adopted a careful skepticism on free trade, versus the enthusiasm of the Clinton administration. She hasn't abandoned the former president--Bill will almost certainly campaign for Hillary--but she's begun to put space between her career and his legacy. The other dynastic candidate in the presidential race, Jeb Bush, is moving in the opposite direction. ""If you want to know who I listen to for advice, it's him,"" said Bush of his brother, President George W. Bush. In this instance, speaking to a group of Manhattan financiers, he was referencing his proposed policy toward Israel. But it's clear Jeb has taken sibling wisdom on a variety of topics. Not only does he sound like his brother on immigration--he wants a path to ""earned legal status"" for 11 million unauthorized immigrants--but he's on board with his foreign policy as well. When asked if, ""knowing what we know now,"" he would have authorized the invasion of Iraq, Jeb Bush said yes. ""I would have,"" he told Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, ""and so would have Hillary Clinton,"" he added. Because the question was whether Bush would go to war with today's information--as opposed to 2002's intelligence--this wasn't really an answer. Clinton's vote to authorize the war with the information she had doesn't mean she would do the same with the information she now has (though, someone should ask). But that's secondary to the astonishing fact that Bush has embraced the most disastrous choice of his brother's administration. To that point, Kelly also asked if Bush thought the war was a mistake. And here, his reply was even more interesting. ""In retrospect,"" Bush said, ""the intelligence that everybody saw, that the world saw, not just the United States, was faulty. And in retrospect, once we invaded and took out Saddam Hussein, we didn't focus on security first, and the Iraqis, in this incredibly insecure environment turned on the United States military because there was no security for themselves and their families. By the way, guess who thinks that those mistakes took place, as well? George W. Bush. So, news flash to the world, if they're trying to find places where there's big space between me and my brother, this might not be one of those."" Either Bush is dodging the question--and looking for ground to defend his brother--or he doesn't understand that the mistake of the war was the decision to launch it, not the shoddy aftermath. Even with a more competent administration in charge, it's likely the Iraq war would have remained a disaster: a needless diversion against an overblown threat that claimed tens of thousands of lives, committed the United States to a long destructive occupation, and destabilized the Middle East in ways that still reverberate. And if Bush doesn't grasp the error of the invasion, then he's liable to make a similar mistake if elected president. Bush has to know this is toxic to the general public. Even with the gruesome violence of ISIS, pluralities--and sometimes majorities--of Americans oppose further major involvement in Iraq. Last June, in a poll from Quinnipiac University, 61 percent of Americans said the Iraq war was the wrong thing to do, and that October, in a poll from NBC News and the Wall Street Journal, 66 percent of Americans said the war was ""not worth it."" But at this moment in the election, Bush isn't speaking to the public. He's speaking to Republicans. And even now, most Republicans think the war was a good idea. Last year, in a poll from USA Today and the Pew Research Center, 52 percent of Republicans said it was ""right to use"" military force in Iraq. And in the aforementioned Quinnipiac survey, 56 percent of Republicans agreed that the war ""was the right thing for the United States."" In that instance, Republicans were the only group to show majority support. If Bush were running unopposed--or with marginal opposition--there might not be an imperative to embrace the Iraq war. But he's running in a crowded field of legitimate competitors, where most are hawkish (Sen. Rand Paul is the notable exception) and one, Sen. Marco Rubio, has the belligerent posturing of George W. Bush in his first term. In his 2010 campaign for Senate, Rubio praised the Iraq war for making the world ""better off,"" and in a 2013 speech in London, he called the war a ""vitally important achievement"" of America's relationship with the United Kingdom. He's pushed interventions in Syria (he would have armed the rebels), opposed withdrawal in Iraq and Afghanistan, and wants a more aggressive stance toward Iran. As Eliana Johnson wrote for National Review last year, Rubio is the neoconservative candidate for 2016: ""To this group, beating back the rising tide of non-interventionism in the Republican party is a top priority, and they consider Rubio a candidate, if not the candidate, capable of doing so."" You can chalk up Jeb Bush's Iraq position to familial loyalty, if you want. But you shouldn't ignore the politics of it. Bush needs to distinguish himself from a younger, more popular competitor in a congested presidential field. Embracing the Iraq war--and his brother's legacy on foreign policy--is one way to challenge Rubio on his own turf, at least among donors and elites. Likewise, over on the left, Clinton is rejecting the triangulation of her husband and adopting progressive positions on criminal justice and immigration reform, to bolster her position and preclude a repeat of the 2008 primary. Most observers assumed Clinton and Bush would be forced to make some moves because of the political legacy of family members. What's ironic is that they've moved opposite of expectations. Bill Clinton is among the most popular presidents of recent memory, and George W. Bush is among the most disliked. But Hillary, eager to define herself and reconstitute the Obama coalition, has distanced herself from her husband while Jeb, fighting to build stature in a melee of a Republican primary, has pulled closer to his unsuccessful brother."
