Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. He has tried twice to bring about comprehensive immigration reform, in 2006 and 2007, earning the blogger-created nickname, ""Grahamnesty."" He once called his critics ""bigots"" at a 2007 meeting of La Raza, which was--gasp--giving him an award. It's for this reason that immigration restrictionists scoff at Graham's call to revisit the 14th Amendment and end the ""birthright citizenship"" granted to children born within American borders no matter where their parents are from. ""This is Lindsey Graham-standing,"" said David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union. ""Coming from Lindsey Graham, this is pandering,"" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies. ""It's not something to take seriously."" Basically, no one agrees with what Graham said when he kicked off this debate. On July 28, he appeared on Greta Van Susteren's Fox News show and declared that ""birthright citizenship, I think, is a mistake [and] I think we should change our Constitution and say, if you come here illegally and have a child, that child is automatically not a citizen."" ""That is going to cause such a stir!"" said Van Susteren. That was a good call. For nearly two weeks, reporters have dogged senators to ask whether they agree with Graham. Liberals and the people Krikorian calls ""high immigration advocates"" have reacted with outrage and new calls to stop the Republicans from taking Congress. It's been a perfect political story, grade-A chuck for the cable news that drives White House spokesman Robert Gibbs to distraction. Most Republicans have endorsed the Graham stratagem. Three former aides to George W. Bush have criticized it, inspiring stories about a ""GOP split"" over immigration for their troubles. Restrictionists--who oppose more immigration, legal or illegal--argue that it's been largely pointless. On Friday, National Review's Daniel Foster got Graham to explain that the 14th Amendment gambit was all about comprehensive immigration reform, a way to put ""all laws on the table"" and get a fresh debate about how to make more immigrants into citizens. The American Spectator's W. James Antle III declared that Graham ""gave the game away"" and said this was just the latest attempt to hornswaggle conservatives by promising them a constitutional amendment. That's how some professional restrictionists see it, too. Graham suggested that an alteration to the 14th Amendment would easily win approval from two-thirds of state legislatures and Congress. But Republican political rhetoric is littered with promises of new amendments about the flag, gay marriage, abortion, and other wedge issues. Some Republicans are also pledging to bring back the Balanced Budget Amendment, which last failed in 1995. None of this, say conservatives, will actually happen. The will to amend the Constitution is not there. Despite what Graham says, amending the Constitution is not easier than passing legislation and waiting for the Supreme Court to rule on it. ""I don't know anyone who thinks we could try the amendment first and win,"" said Roy Beck, president of the restrictionist group NumbersUSA. Krikorian compared the Graham stratagem to the mostly forgotten aspect of 1996 welfare reform that outlawed benefits for recent legal immigrants. That, he said, was a bone tossed to restrictionists that distracted them from the brief political opening they had to cut down on legal immigration quotas. ""It's just posturing,"" said Krikorian. ""It's like the flag-burning amendment that will never pass."" But beyond all the pessimism and mistrust, immigration restrictionists are winning something: They're having a debate about how to restrict immigration. In his attempt to defibrillate the amnesty debate, Graham shoved the entire immigration argument further to the right. It works like this. When Arizona passed SB 1070, the law that allows police to check perps for proof of citizenship, many mainstream Republicans blanched at the law. Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia, for example, called it not ""necessarily helpful to democracy."" Then followed a minor legislative fix to the law and three months of polls showing its popularity, basically, everywhere. By the start of August, McDonnell's attorney general had signed an order putting Virginia's policy in line with Arizona's. So the restrictionist hope is not that the Constitution will be amended. It's that Americans will start thinking about birthright citizenship. That's an issue on which restrictionists fare less well with the public than, say, on whether to deport illegal immigrants who commit other crimes. (An NBC News poll in July showed 49 percent of Americans backing birthright citizenship, compared with 46 percent who opposed it.) Still, it's good enough for Roy Beck. Get a debate about the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act going, gather support from Republicans in Congress who want to alter it, and you have the seeds of victory. The legislation to change the law is foundering in the House, but someone--probably current sponsor Rep. Gary Miller, R-Calif.--will resurrect it in 2011. ""All we really need to do is change that act in the Congress,"" Beck said. ""The people who really want to get rid of birthright for tourists and illegal aliens want to pass a law, not debate an amendment. It's fine that Lindsey Graham started this fire, actually, even though he doesn't represent what we're doing."" Even if no one buys into Graham's 14th Amendment gambit, has Graham--the great immigration reformer's hope--actually hastened the end of birthright citizenship? Maybe. All that immigration restrictionists can hope for at the moment is for their cause to be elevated from the pile of ""fringe issues"" to the much nicer pile of ""campaign-ready issues."" The Graham-standing, which sets up a fight they can't win, gives them an opening to talk about an issue that, weeks ago, no one was talking about. That's not what Graham is promising them, but they'll take it. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	Why anti-immigration forces are both scornful of and grateful to Lindsey Graham.

After the Taxpayer March on Washington on Sept. 12, 2009, the Fair and Balanced network shamed its competitors with splashy photos of the event and the headline ""How Did ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC and CNN Miss This Story?"" This year, reporters are determined to prove Roger Ailes wrong. They have crowded into the Tea Party group's Washington headquarters for the second time this year to learn about a training session for local activists. Some reporters have been embedded here all weekend, sitting in on seminars like ""Care and Feeding of Volunteers"" and ""How To Stay Out of Jail This Year."" Reporters for CBS, BBC News, Reuters, Bloomberg, USA Today, and Fox News sat patiently as FreedomWorks President Matt Kibbe introduced the local organizers who are going to save America. ""There's been a lot of talk in some wings of the press about the loss of energy in the Tea Party movement,"" said Kibbe, who looks and talks like Billy Bob Thornton cleaned up for a job interview. ""Talk about some of the squabbling that's been going on. I would argue that these are not problems, but growing pains."" And with that, the reporters were off and interviewing. ""I'm a huge preacher of openness,"" said Adam Brandon, the group's spokesman, who taught a weekend seminar called ""What to Expect From the Media."" ""This is how you fight back from the charges of 'Astroturf' and racism. They get to know you, and you can ask them: Am I Astroturf? Am I a racist?"" On Monday, FreedomWorks displayed the latest version of its target list--the people its PAC would most like to defeat--the latest signs and fliers printed up for its candidates, the reading list handed out to activists (it includes  Atlas Shrugged and the new manifesto by FreedomWorks Chairman Dick Armey and Kibbe, Give Me Liberty), and advice for contacting the media. (""Always try to do personal emails or be sure to use the BCC field. Never advertise which other media outlets you are trying to score a hit with."") This event was scheduled weeks ago. Unfortunately, the meet-and-greet coincided with Ken Vogel's latest Politico write-up of those ""growing pains"" that Kibbe wanted to downplay. The story points out that FreedomWorks raised only 5 percent more in 2009 than it raised in 2008, peaking at $7.9 million. So Brandon changed tack slightly: The article just showed that FreedomWorks is a low-budget, grass-roots, non-Astroturf operation. ""We're one of the smallest PACs in the game,"" said Brandon. ""We're going to spend, at most $10 million. We don't know those Karl Rove donors."" He leaned down and tapped a stack of Rand Paul fliers that were bound for FreedomWorks members in Kentucky. ""These cost less than one cent per flier. Fractions of a cent."" The newest member of FreedomWorks' political operation is David Spielman, the campaign coordinator for the PAC. Spielman graduated from college just last year, and the bulk of his experience comes from a floundering campaign against Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz. It just happens to be experience that FreedomWorks can use. Tea Party groups in the district were active. ""You'd see the same people showing up at everything,"" Spielman said. ""Town halls, [Americans for Prosperity] Hands Off My Health Care tours."" The problem, Spielman said, was that those activists couldn't be relied on to do the brutal and boring work of campaign volunteering. His job now was to inspire activists in the other 49 states to psych themselves up, spend their own money, burn their own time. (In fact, other than $100 travel vouchers and discounted hotel rooms, most of the people at this weekend's conference paid their own way.) The gallery at the FreedomWorks offices were pledging to do that. ""I don't know how much I've spent,"" said Bob Koch, a retiree from Valley Forge, Pa. ""Hundreds of dollars. So many hours driving to D.C."" ""I spend 60 hours a week on this,"" said Anna Puig, another Pennsylvania activist. Featured in MSNBC's documentary ""The Rise of the New Right,"" which so angered Tea Party activists that it inspired a boycott of MSNBC advertisers, Puig now says the documentary was a recruitment godsend. An onrush of people who saw her on TV and wanted to join her Kitchen Table Patriots group changed the way she felt about coverage from the hated ""MSM.""It's not clear that FreedomWorks has anything at all to fear from the MSM. The 9/12 march is getting a sequel, one that the group says will be more focused on get-out-the-vote efforts, candidates, and the movement's bottom-up ""Contract From America,"" a pledge for contenders to make to prove their Tea Party bona fides. Two weeks before that, FreedomWorks is co-sponsoring Glenn Beck's own Washington mega-rally, which will co-star Sarah Palin on the anniversary of Martin Luther King's ""I Have a Dream"" speech. The publicity is mixed, but for the Tea Party's purposes, it really doesn't matter.  Two mega-rallies in three weeks, said Brandon, will ""psych up"" activists, renew their sense of purpose, and fill them with the confidence to beat the candidates opposed by FreedomWorks PAC. * ""If Beck turns a few people off,"" said Brandon, ""it won't make a difference."" ""He's not for everybody, but there's an expression I like to use,"" said Koch. ""You can eat the meat and spit out the bones."" Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter.

Time, then, for us to unveil our suggested reading list. A week ago we asked Slate readers to offer books that fit into several categories from which he and his predecessors have usually selected their material: presidential history, fiction, crime novels (based on last year's list, a presidential favorite), and current events. We also asked for a ""popular book"" that might allow the president to look in touch with the citizenry. This is an election year, after all, so no gimmick to improve his falling approval rating will go untried. Many of you may be disappointed that your suggestions were not accepted, but the U.S. Constitution wasn't really in the spirit of the contest. We were looking for relevant reading. (Kidding!) But we're pretty sure that as a former professor of constitutional law, the president has read the Constitution several times. Economics in One Lesson,  When Presidents Lie, and a bound copy of his campaign promises were other wiseacre submissions. The call to provide a book by a female author (to make up for last year's omission of same) was met with gusto. The overwhelming favorite: Ayn Rand. But she is an author and not the name of a book. We didn't know whether people meant to suggest  Atlas Shrugged or  The Fountainhead or perhaps this handsome box set, containing both. Herewith is the final list, culled from your suggestions. Some were chosen because lots of people suggested the same book and some were picked because our readers offered a good reason the president should include them in his beach bag, which we've listed after some of the titles: Presidential/Historical  1776, by David McCullough: ""Portrait of a leader, George Washington, who in the face of every calamity continued to persevere with an iron will and a public persona that never spoke of his private anguish and despair."" Benjamin Franklin, by Walter Isaacson: ""The patron saint of sensible nonpartisanship."" Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter, by Seth Grahame-Smith. If Obama is as big a fan of Lincoln as he says he is, perhaps he's already read this. Fiction Blindness, Jose Saramago: ""This book taps into what is most sacred and fundamental about democracy and human cooperation. It tears down the bureaucracy of everyday life and reminds us how much we rely on one another and our inner sense of goodness to survive."" Cutting for Stone, by Abraham Verghese. This was a winner in the ""transport the president out of his world"" category.. Current Events or Issues  Shop Class as Soulcraft, by Matthew B. Crawford. Barack Obama is your new bicycle repairman. (Also a suggestion on Slate's reading list for incoming college freshmen.) Last Call, by  Dan Okrent. * This story of prohibition was suggested by conservatives and liberals alike, though they seem to have taken different lessons from it. For conservatives, it's the story of the ""folly of government intervention."" For liberals, it's a story that ""shows how we as a country have always been richly endowed in wingnuts."" The Rational Optimist, by Matt Ridley. ""The best antidote to malaise."" Zeitoun,  by Dave Eggers: ""A good reminder of all that government can do wrong.""* Crime Novels  Gone Tomorrow by Lee Child: ""Excellent urban crime drama, with international-politics implications."" Savages, by Don Winslow: Crime novel set in Orange County, Calif. Interesting look at Mexican drug cartels. Withering political commentary. Very funny, which would be good for a president with no apparent sense of humor. * * The Common Touch  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,  by Stieg Larsson: ""Everyone is reading it. It would connect him with a lot of readers. Plus it would be a good transporter for him."" The Bible. ""Show the common touch--best selling book in the world. Symbol of seeking comfort in touch times (economically, poltically). Helps deflect conservative attacks and the weird 'closet Muslim' rumors.""

3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/08/divided_government_redux.html	"Who would have guessed that the Republican leader of the Senate would be calling for the return of Bill Clinton? That's what Mitch McConnell of Kentucky did Thursday when talking about the political evolution he expects from Barack Obama. The midterm election is likely to shrink (and perhaps erase) the Democratic majorities in Congress. McConnell, who voted guilty on both of Clinton's impeachment charges, held him up as a model for the way a president can come back after his party loses a congressional election. Clinton's declaration after the 1994 GOP victory that ""the era of big government is over,"" said McConnell, ""showed an incredible amount of flexibility."" A chastened president who works with an emboldened opposition: That's just one of the post-election fantasies being shopped to voters. McConnell was pushing that narrative in response to another one in which he's an unblinking fanatic. For months, Democrats have been trying to argue that the GOP is indistinguishable from the Tea Party. In a recent ad, McConnell is included in a collage with Rand Paul, the Tea Party favorite who hopes to become the other Kentucky senator. In the DNC ad McConnell looks as if he has a sour stomach, and the music is menacing. At a breakfast with reporters hosted by the Christian Science Monitor, McConnell was chipper and singing a happy tune of cooperation. He argued that if more Republicans are elected to the Senate, it will create bipartisan compromise legislation, because neither party will have a large enough majority. ""If you're between 55 and 45 you get genuine bipartisan agreement. I hope what we're going to have is more balance, which will give us opportunities together that were missing when you have [the current] disparity."" But balance only goes so far. McConnell continued, ""I'm not going to be very interested in doing things left of center. It's going to have to be center-right, and I think the president is a flexible man and I'm hoping he'll become a born-again moderate."" McConnell made it sound as if the president's conversion might have started with his private meeting with him Wednesday. It was their first since Obama has taken office. The two men agreed not to talk about the details, but McConnell described the meeting as if Obama were already preparing the way for a post-election Clinton-like accommodation with the opposition.  Asked why he thought Obama invited him, McConnell said, ""The election is not tomorrow, but most people feel there is going to be a mid-course correction, and the president is a very smart guy, and he figures he's going to be seeing a lot more of me in the future, and I enjoyed our discussion and I look forward to seeing more of him.""* Throughout the hour, it became clear just how much McConnell is the anti-Rand Paul. Senate candidate Paul is regularly driving his campaign off-message. McConnell passed up every opportunity to weigh in on red-meat topics. He stayed focused on the economy, the issue voters say they care most about. McConnell was asked twice about the judge's ruling overturning Proposition 8. He could have talked about activist judges, a favorite conservative punching bag. The judge in this case is from San Francisco, a city that in some conservative circles is an epithet. In 2004 a ruling on same-sex marriage from the Massachusetts Supreme Court inspired president George Bush to call for a constitutional amendment outlawing gay marriage. McConnell, though, just said he thought voters would be more worried about the economy. What about the Islamic center being planned near Ground Zero in New York? Newt Gingrich and Sarah Palin are exercised about it. William Kristol is, too. When asked about it, McConnell said it was a local issue. Next question. McConnell won't jump on the red-meat issues, because he wants voters to look to the GOP congressional leaders and see them focused on the issue they care about the most--the economy--and he knows that the GOP base, which might be excited by hot rhetoric on these sideline issues, is already energized enough in this election. Finally, McConnell was also disciplined enough to stay vague about what the GOP will actually do if it gets more power. Why get specific now and give Democrats items they can attack? Republicans would like to make this election a referendum on the current president. I asked McConnell how the policies the Republicans are putting forward now would be different than George Bush's policies. Democrats say they'll be identical. ""The Bush administration ended two years ago. We're moving forward, not reliving the past,"" he said before promising that the GOP would be offering an agenda in late September. The hope is that unveiling an agenda that late will show that the GOP has ideas but won't expose them to too much scrutiny. If Barack Obama is going to meet Republicans halfway after the election he's going to have to wait almost that long to find out where he's supposed to go.

According to his worldview, the United States represents Christianity, al-Qaida represents Muslims, Christians won't protect Muslims, the West hates mosques, peaceful coexistence is a fraud, and the ""war on terrorism"" is really a war on Islam. By spreading this message, Bin Laden works to turn Muslims against the United States and rally them to al-Qaida. Now Bin Laden has an ally in this propaganda campaign: Newt Gingrich. Over the past two weeks, in a series of articles and speeches, Gingrich has declared a religious war that suits al-Qaida's agenda almost perfectly. While denouncing ""Islamists"" rather than Islam, Gingrich has blurred the distinction by selecting as his initial target the construction of a mosque  near Ground Zero. Everything Bin Laden says about the United States, Gingrich validates. All you have to do is read their statements, side by side. BIN LADENGINGRICH[N]ow that senior U.S. officials have spoken ... every Muslim should rush to defend his religion. ... They came out to fight this group of people who declared their faith in God and refused to abandon their religion. They came out to fight Islam in the name of terrorism. ( Oct. 7, 2001)One of our biggest mistakes in the aftermath of 9/11 was naming our response to the attacks ""the war on terror"" instead of accurately identifying radical Islamists (and the underlying ideology of radical Islamism) as the target of our campaign. ( July 28, 2010)This war is fundamentally religious. ... Those who try to cover this crystal clear fact, which the entire world has admitted, are deceiving the Islamic nation. ... It is a question of faith, not a war against terrorism, as Bush and Blair try to depict it. ... Fear God, O Muslims and rise to support your religion. ( Nov. 3, 2001)Some radical Islamists use terrorism as a tactic to impose sharia, but others use non-violent methods--a cultural, political, and legal jihad that seeks the same totalitarian goal even while claiming to repudiate violence. Thus, the term ""war on terrorism"" is far too narrow a framework in which to think about the war in which we are engaged against the radical Islamists.( July 28, 2010)It has become clear that the West in general and America in particular have an unspeakable hatred for Islam. ... A few days ago, they ... dropped--in what they said was a mistake--a radio-guided bomb on a mosque where ulemas were praying. They targeted the mosque, killing 150 Muslim worshippers. It is the hatred of crusaders. ( Dec. 27, 2001)[T]he Ground Zero mosque is all about conquest and thus an assertion of Islamist triumphalism which we should not tolerate. ... It is simply grotesque to erect a mosque at the site of the most visible and powerful symbol of the horrible consequences of radical Islamist ideology. ( July 28, 2010)The intentions of the Americans have also been clarified in statements about the need to change the beliefs, curricula, and morals of the Muslims to become more tolerant, as they put it. In clearer terms, it is a religious-economic war. ( Jan. 4, 2004)America is experiencing an Islamist cultural-political offensive designed to undermine and destroy our civilization. Sadly, too many of our elites are the willing apologists for those who would destroy them if they could. No mosque. No self deception. No surrender. ( July 21, 2010)The West is incapable of recognizing the rights of others. It will not be able to respect others' beliefs or feelings. The West still believes in ethnic supremacy and looks down on other nations. ... How can we explain France's stance on the headscarf and the banning on wearing it at schools ... This is a Zionist-Crusader war. ( April 23, 2006)[T]hey proposed a 13-story mosque and community center that will extol the glories of Islamic tolerance for people of other faiths, all while overlooking the site where radical Islamists killed almost 3,000 people in a shocking act of hatred. Building this structure on the edge of the battlefield created by radical Islamists is not a celebration of religious pluralism and mutual tolerance; it is a political statement of shocking arrogance and hypocrisy. ... [F]or radical Islamists, the mosque would become an icon of triumph, encouraging them in their challenge to our civilization. ( July 28, 2010)So what is the sin of the Afghans due to which you are continuing this unjust war against them? Their only sin is that they are Muslims, and this illustrates the extent of the Crusaders' hatred of Islam and its people. ( Nov. 29, 2007)This is not a war on terrorism. Terrorism is an activity. This is a struggle with radical Islamists in both their militant and their stealth form. ... The stealth form believes in using cultural, intellectual and political [power], but their end goal is exactly the same. ( July 29, 2010)""O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians for your friends and protectors: they are but friends and protectors to each other. And he amongst you that turns to them (for friendship) is of them."" ... Similar are sophistries like ""dialogue of religions,"" ""freedom of opinion,"" ""freedom of speech,"" ""peaceful coexistence."" ... ( March 14, 2009)President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, as our troops were landing in Normandy, went on national radio at 10 o'clock at night and actually led the nation in six and a half minutes of prayer, something very few modern liberals appreciate. This is part of what he said: ""Our sons, pride of our nation, this day have set up on a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our Republic, our religion, and our civilization, and to set free a suffering humanity."" This was not a man who was confused about what the stakes were, nor was he confused about what the goal was. ( July 29, 2010)So, who stood by America the Christian, and who supported it? Isn't that Zardari and his government and army? ... Obama has walked like his predecessors in increasing hostility towards Muslims. ... I encourage my Muslim nation to stand by the side of the mujahideen and support them everywhere. (""Speech to the Pakistani Nation,""  June 3, 2009)President Roosevelt said the following: ""We must remember what the collaborative understanding between Communism and Nazism has done to the processes of democracy abroad. Those forces hate democracy and Christianity as two phases of the same civilization. They oppose democracy because it is Christian. They oppose Christianity because it preaches democracy. Their objective is to prevent democracy from becoming strong."" Again, this is hardly a man who's confused about what's at stake. Winston Churchill, at the very peak of the Battle of Britain, said, ""Upon this battle depends the survival of Christian civilization."" ( July 29, 2010 )The war which has been taking place on your soil these past years is a war between Islam and the International Crusade. - (""Fight On, Champions of Somalia,""  March 19, 2009)There should be no mosque near Ground Zero in New York so long as there are no churches or synagogues in Saudi Arabia. The time for double standards that allow Islamists to behave aggressively toward us while they demand our weakness and submission is over. ( July 21, 2010) Several astute writers--Robert Wright, Jeffrey Goldberg,  Blake Hounshell, Andrew Sullivan--have explained the idiocy of the anti-mosque campaign. By opposing the mosque, Gingrich, Sarah Palin, Rudy Giuliani, and other Republicans think they're standing up to Bin Laden. But Bin Laden isn't fighting for Islam. He's fighting to transform a war of terrorists against civilization into a war of infidels against Islam. He's fighting to persuade Muslims that they belong on his side, not on ours. And you're helping him, Newt. You're giving him exactly the fight he wants. Nice going.

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/08/antiantiincumbency.html	"BREAKING: A historic wave of anti-incumbency is sweeping the nation. Angry voters first threw Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, out of office in a dramatic Tea Party coup. Then Sen. Arlen Specter, D-Pa., went down to Rep. Joe Sestak, D-Pa., in the primary. On Tuesday, Rep. Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, D-Mich., lost a primary. ""Incumbents beware,"" warned the Associated Press. ""Another lawmaker just bit the dust."" If you ask Fox News, this has been ""a primary season fraught with anti-incumbent furor."" Whose head will the anti-incumbent hordes claim next? But let's put this in perspective. So far this year, 282 federal-level incumbents have been up for re-election. Of those, only six have lost their seats--four in the House and two in the Senate. (Aside from Bennett, Kilpatrick, and Specter, there's Rep. Alan Mollohan, D-W.Va.; Rep. Parker Griffith, R-Ala.; and Rep. Bob Inglis, R-S.C.) That's 2 percent of all incumbents. If you count only the 119 incumbents who have faced primary challengers, the proportion who were defeated goes up to 5 percent. Is that a lot? Historically, no. While it's hard to game out exactly how many incumbents had been defeated at this point in election years past, this year isn't a huge anomaly, according to University of Virginia's Larry Sabato, who has been trying to tamp down the anti-incumbency myth since May. ""This is about average,"" Sabato says. ""Usually there's one Senate seat lost, we're at two; about five House seats, we're at four."" Looking at the rest of the primaries, he says, ""I can tell you at most three or four more will lose, total."" The six incumbents who have lost are largely anomalies. Bennett, for example, was ousted by a small Utah convention dominated by the party's conservative base. Sure, all primaries skew toward the party's base, but this was a caucus of 3,500 Republican activists. Had the whole state of Utah voted, Bennett might well have survived. Specter, too, was a special case. After switching parties, he was asking for the votes of Pennsylvania Democrats who had spent their lives voting against him. Same with Parker Griffith, who lost to another Republican soon after becoming one. Kilpatrick's loss was abnormal, too: She barely won the primary in 2008, when her son, Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, was embroiled in a sex scandal. In 2010, after he was sentenced to five years in prison, she lost. That's not to say a lot of incumbents won't lose in the general elections. They probably will. But that's not because of anti-incumbent sentiment so much as anti-Democrat sentiment. Many of the moderate Democrats who joined in the 2006 rebellion against the party in power are now vulnerable as the country rebels against ... the party in power. Some of them, fearing defeat, have chosen not to run. So goes the pendulum. There is no proven relationship between incumbent performance in the primaries and in the general. (If an incumbent loses in a primary, after all, he or she usually doesn't compete in the general.) In both 2004 and 2006, for example, two members of the House lost their seats in the primaries. But whereas 2004 turned out to be a fairly status-quo general election, 2006 saw a Democratic surge. Looking at the primary results, though, you never would have known. Doomsayers in 2010 could point to proxies for incumbent losses--a bad economy, low presidential approval ratings--but again, those factors tend to work against the incumbent party, not so much incumbents across the board. The fact is, even an ""anti-incumbent"" year isn't that bad for incumbents. The average rate of re-election for members of the House since 1964 has been 93.3 percent. (Over the last decade, it's been 96 percent.) In the Senate, the average since 1964 has been 81.6 percent. So what's the worst-case scenario for this year? In June, George Washington University political scientist John Sides compared House re-election rates from years past with historical polling on whether voters would prefer candidates who have been in Congress or those who haven't. He found a slight correlation and extrapolated that, based on polling in 2010, the re-election rate would be somewhere around 87 percent. Compared with past years, that's pretty low. But if a year in which 87 percent of incumbents win re-election is considered ""anti-incumbent,"" that says as much about the power of incumbency as it does about the year itself.

If or when it does, they expect it to look like this. Fade-in to black-and-white image of Rep. Whiteguy Bluedog, looking sleazy and pale as he messily eats a sandwich. NARRATOR: What is your congressman trying to hide? Images of Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., and Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., appear behind the congressman, looking just as sleazy, but much less pale. NARRATOR: Why hasn't he returned the $1,000 he took from Harlem Democrat Charlie Rangel, who's facing a trial for cheating on his taxes? Why did he oppose investigating Democrat Maxine Waters, who got a tax break for her husband's business and says that American spies invented crack cocaine? The images of Waters and Rangel fade and are replaced by slow-motion  footageof two members of the New Black Panther Party, stalking outside of a polling place in 2008. NARRATOR: Why did he support Barack Obama's lawyers when they dropped a case against the racist New Black Panther Party, a hate group that threatened voters in the last election? The image of the Panthers fade, and the congressman morphs into Barack Obama. NARRATOR: What is he trying to hide? Is there something about him we should know? Since last week's double shot of rotten ethics news--the investigations into Rangel and Waters, both of whom refuse so far to settle--Democrats have contemplated two potential nightmares. The first is that Republicans will use the troubles of Rangel and Waters to try to depress the Democrats' African-American base, making them less likely to come to the rescue of endangered incumbents. The second is that Republicans will use the embattled committee chairs the way that they once used Willie Horton, as Halloween masks in TV ads. ""In 2006, the Democrats could have put out ads about Mark Foley, and it wouldn't have made a difference whether they used pictures of him or not,"" says Bob Shrum, a Democratic strategist for multiple presidential campaigns who now teaches at New York University  and warns of Republican race-baiting in the weeks ahead. ""In 2010, if Republicans put up photos of Rangel or Waters, they're putting them there to elicit another kind of response. That would be fear among white voters."" The Democratic angst comes, in part, because they know they're facing a whiter, older electorate this year than they faced in 2008. The electorate that put Obama into office and pulled in new, vulnerable Democrats was 74 percent white, and 53 percent were older than 45. In 2006, the last midterm election and a fine year for Democrats overall, the electorate was 79 percent white, and 63 percent were 45 or older.  Will an older, whiter electorate in Nov. 2010 be susceptible to a racially-tinged message from the GOP? ""You'll notice that [conservatives] always refer to him as 'Harlem Democrat' Charlie Rangel,"" said one Democratic congressional aide. ""It's not a coincidence. They want you to know the guy represents Harlem--get it?"" Republicans respond with a collective rolling of eyes. This is Michael Steele's party, they say, set to elect its first African-American member of Congress in eight years (South Carolina's Tim Scott). Rangel's scandals have been churning for two years, kicked off by the New York Times'  investigation of his taxes. Any notion that it would be playing a race card to remind voters of this, they say, is laughable. Ladd Ehlinger Jr., an Alabama political consultant who produced larger-than-life spots for Republican candidates like Dale Peterson and Rick Barber this year, laughs uncontrollably when told that Democrats are even talking about this. ""I have advice for Republicans who are too weak-kneed to make hay out of Rangel,"" he says. ""If anyone starts coming at you about Rangel or any of this stuff, just [say] this is post-racial America. This isn't about race. It's about a fat guy lying out in the sun on a beach and not paying his taxes."" Of course, Republican strategists are always being accused of race-baiting. They spent much of the 2008 campaign trying to avoid that charge, wincing whenever Democrats found racial subtext in their ads, such as a McCain campaign corker that portrayed Barack Obama as a vapid, sexualized celebrity. Team McCain was so cautious about race that it deep-sixed a staffer, Soren Dayton, after he tweeted a link to a video that compared Obama to history's more memorable black radicals. Democrats aren't comforted much by that experience. They haven't forgotten 1988 (a presidential race much more race-tinged than 2008) when the ""independent"" Americans for Bush committee air-dropped its toxic Horton ad into one small market. The ad was then discussed (and amplified) ad infinitum on cable news. Alternatively, information about Rangel, Waters, and/or the New Black Panthers, might be ""laundered,"" to use the word of one strategist, to conservative blogs like Andrew Breitbart's BigGovernment.com. ""This is the cry wolf syndrome,"" says Breitbart, who will appear at a Republican National Committee fundraiser later this year. ""The battle against legitimate racism, which does in fact exist, is suffering from cry wolf syndrome,  Mike Nifong syndrome, Spencer Ackerman syndrome."" Breitbart refers to those two people--the district attorney disgraced  in the bogus Duke lacrosse ""rape case"" and the reporter who once suggested (off the record) that Republicans obsessing over Jeremiah Wright be called racist--to make the point that Democrats will accuse him, and accuse Republicans, of racism, no matter what they do. Scott Wheeler knows what it's like. In 2008, his PAC, the National Republican Trust, ran an 11th-hour blitz of commercials reminding voters of Jeremiah Wright. ""The New York Times called me,"" remembers Wheeler. ""The Boston Globe called me. I had to tell my children: Whatever you're reading about your dad, you ought to know that it's not true."" Democrats included the National Republican Trust in a memo, widely circulated last month, warning donors about the money conservatives would be spending to beat Democrats. It's one of those organizations they think might run ads that throw their incumbents into the racial briar patch. They're right. ""We've thought about running a New Black Panther ad,"" says Wheeler. ""The question we'd ask is, where do these Democratic candidates stand on an investigation of why the Department of Justice dropped the case against them? The House had a 15-14, party-line vote against investigating this, so it's fair to ask why those members voted that way. And it's not race-baiting. This administration doesn't answer questions. What is Obama's connection to Louis Farrakhan? He's never answered questions about it."" (Actually, he has.) That's the conservative response to the ""race-baiting"" charge, more or less. They have the right to bring up these issues; they fully expect Democrats to try to deflect them with a debate about race. If liberals think the lesson of the Willie Horton ad was that Republicans use race to win elections, conservatives think the lesson was that Democrats will scandalize and racialize just about anything. ""Americans of all colors/beliefs/persuasions don't have jobs,"" says Floyd Brown, who produced the Horton ad in 1988 and continues to work as a political consultant. ""The economy sucks, and liberals want to hold college seminars on racism and gender bias."" Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	Will the GOP play the race card on Rangel and Waters?

7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/08/americas_peculiar_amnesia.html	"Historical amnesia is at once the most endearing and the most frustrating of American qualities. On the one hand, it means that--F. Scott Fitzgerald to the contrary--there really are second acts in American lives. People can move somewhere else, reinvent themselves, start again. On the other hand, our inability to remember what our policy was last week--never mind last decade--drives outsiders crazy. We forget that we supported the dictator before we decided to destroy him. Then we can't understand why others, especially the dictator's subjects, don't always believe in the goodness of our intentions or the sincerity of our devotion to democracy. Domestic policy is no different, as I learned from readers who wrote to denounce my column of two weeks ago. I had argued that Americans on both the left and the right have, for the last decade, consistently voted for high-spending members of Congress and consistently supported ever-higher levels of government intervention and regulation at all levels of public life. As a result, the federal government expanded under George W. Bush's administration at a rate that was, at least until President Barack Obama came along, totally unprecedented in U.S. history. Alas, historical amnesia appears to have affected some readers, many of whom are under the impression that President Bush believed in small government and that recent Republican congressional leaders opposed federal spending. Here is a more accurate assessment: ""President Bush increased government spending more than any of the six presidents preceding him, including LBJ."" I didn't write that; the astute libertarian economist Veronique de Rugy did. She also points out that during his eight years in office, Bush's ""anti-government"" Republican administration increased the federal budget by an extraordinary 104 percent. By comparison, the increase under President Bill Clinton's watch was a relatively measly 11 percent (a rate, I might add, lower than Ronald Reagan's). In his last term in office, Bush increased discretionary spending--that means non-Medicare, non-Social Security--by 48.6 percent. In his final year in office, fiscal year 2009, he spent more than $32,000 per American, up from $17,216.68 in fiscal year 2001. But Bush is not the only culprit. After all, the federal government usually spends money in response to state demands. Look, for example, at the demands made by Alaska, a state that produces a disproportionate quantity of anti-government rhetoric, which has had Republican governors since 2002, and which has a congressional delegation dominated by Republicans. Nevertheless, for the last decade, Alaska has been among the top three largest state recipients of federal funding, per capita. Usually, Alaska is far ahead--sometimes three times as far ahead--of most other states in the union. Largely, this is because of one famous Alaskan, Sen. Ted Stevens--a Republican--who devoted himself to securing federal funding for his state during more than four decades in the Senate. Not only were his efforts extremely popular among his Republican constituents--he was re-elected multiple times--they won him many, many imitators. Timothy Noah has pointed out that Sarah Palin, when mayor of Wasilla, hired Stevens' former chief of staff as a Washington lobbyist. As a result, the 6,700 inhabitants of Wasilla enjoyed $27 million in federal earmarks over a four-year period. Please note, angry readers, that I am not citing these numbers in order to claim that the Obama administration has done any better. On the contrary, the Obama administration is far more profligate than either Clinton or Bush, terrifyingly so. Following the president's first budget, de Rugy predicted ""unprecedented and sustained levels of debt for the American people, their children, and grandchildren."" But then, the Democratic Party does not call itself the party of small government. The Republican Party does. Of course, parties can change, politicians can see the light, lessons can be learned--and perhaps some Republicans have learned them. But you cannot start from scratch. You cannot forget history. You cannot pretend that the Republican Party has not supported big and wasteful spending programs--energy subsidies, farm subsidies, unnecessary homeland security projects, profligate defense contracts, you name it--for the last decade. Before the Republican Party can have any credibility on any spending issues whatsoever, Republican leaders need to speak frankly about the mistakes of the past. They also must be extremely specific about which policies and which programs they are planning to cut in the future. What will it be? Social Security or the military budget? Medicare or the TSA? Vague ""anti-government"" rhetoric just doesn't cut it anymore: If you want a smaller government, you have to tell us how you will create one. Like  Slate on Facebook.

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/07/rangel_agonistes.html	"Rep. Charlie Rangel had to decide on Thursday which he cares about more: his party or his job. The answer, for now: his job. As the House ethics committee prepared to read its 13 charges against Rangel--the culmination of a two-year investigation--there was a flurry of reports that Rangel would strike a deal with the committee and thereby avoid an embarrassing trial in September. But the deal didn't materialize in time, and the hearing proceeded. Rangel, a 20-term Democrat, could still strike a bargain, but it would require approval from one of the committee's five Republicans. And during the hearing, at least, they didn't sound ready to make a deal. ""Congressman Rangel was given the opportunity to negotiate a settlement in the investigation phase,"" said Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the committee's ranking Republican. ""We are now in the trial phase."" The prospect of a September trial represents a Worst Case Scenario for Democrats. It would showcase a prominent Democrat's alleged ethical failings two months before the midterm elections, boosting the GOP case that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has failed in her promise to ""drain the swamp"" of corruption in Washington. (The 13 charges include allegations that he used public rent-controlled housing for campaign work, failed to report $75,000 in income on a villa in the Dominican Republic, and used congressional letterhead to solicit donations for a City College educational center named after him.) Some Democrats have quietly pushed Rangel to make a deal. At least three have urged him to resign. But Rangel seems to think he has a shot at winning. All along, he has insisted that he didn't intentionally break any House rules or statutes. And that may well be true. A plea deal would probably require him to admit wrongdoing. While it's understandable that he doesn't want to end a remarkable four-decade career under a cloud--especially if he didn't mean to break any laws--Rangel has only made life harder for fellow Democrats, and on himself. From day one, he has lashed out at anyone who questioned him about the alleged violations. When a New York Times reporter called to ask about the rent-controlled apartments in 2008, Rangel replied, ""Why should I help you embarrass me?"" and hung up. Later that year, when the Times reported that Rangel met with an oil company CEO who had donated $1 million to the Rangel Center on the same day that Rangel's committee approved a loophole worth millions of dollars to the company, Rangel fired back at the Times. He downplayed the allegations to the end. In its report, the House ethics committee notes two instances in which Rangel claimed that the allegations were ginned up by the press--even after the committee had notified him of its charges. The report also faults Rangel for repeatedly delaying the investigation. Just last week, Rangel bristled when NBC's Luke Russert asked him whether he feared losing his job over the allegations, calling it a ""dumb question"" and accusing Russert of ""trying to make copy."" Sure, Rangel might be no better off if he'd been more polite. But the outbursts earned him no goodwill. Moreover, they gave the impression that he thinks this kind of behavior--failing to report taxes, handouts for donors--is no big deal. That makes it hard for the Democratic leadership to claim it is cracking down on corruption and boosting transparency. (Rangel stepped down from the Ways and Means chairmanship in March.) There were signs today that Rangel has lost his bluster. He spoke to reporters at the Capitol Thursday more in sadness than in anger. ""Sixty years ago, I survived a Chinese attack in North Korea, and as a result I haven't had a bad day since,"" he said. ""But today, I have to reassess that statement."" Meanwhile, he has been blunt with Democrats, telling them to save themselves rather than risk their reputations to defend him. ""I know you love me,"" Rangel told a Democratic colleague. ""But love yourself more.""What he has yet to realize, apparently, is that their fates are inextricably linked. If he goes down, so do they. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/07/mixed_messages.html	"Neither Tom Perriello nor Gerry Connolly, both first-term Democrats from Virginia, wants to talk about Charlie Rangel. ""I think the people who are most obsessed with that are you,"" said Connolly at a meeting with reporters hosted by the centrist Democratic group Third Way. ""My constituents don't even know who Charlie [is]."" Voters don't bring it up at town hall meetings, said Perriello, who has 20 more such meetings scheduled for August. Rangel, the New York Democrat who stepped down from the powerful Ways and Means Committee in March, has been charged with violating House ethics rules and faces a possible September trial. Republicans hope to make his case into a broader attack on Democratic leadership. Scores of Democrats have returned money Rangel donated to their campaigns. A few have asked for Rangel to resign. Still, his two House colleagues insisted it was a ginned up controversy that likely wouldn't amount to much. On message! Both men wanted to duck the issue. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi did promise in 2006 that Democrats would ""drain the swamp"" and improve ethics in Congress, but never mind. She also needs every Democrat to avoid distractions for the next three months and talk about Democratic accomplishments and their plan for the economy. ""People want jobs, people want to be able to feed their families and pay their bills right now,"" said Perriello with a sigh. That sigh encapsulated the frustrating dynamic of this election, at least as these two men see it: too many distractions. Some of the problems are self-inflicted. Rangel is a special bummer, but the larger issue is the party has a problem staying on its economic message. The media make the situation worse, according to the two men. We ignore the Democratic Party's achievements and are too easily swayed by conservatives who use Rangel's woes or other issues to consume valuable news cycles between now and the election. Another problem was one the two men didn't articulate but instead demonstrated: It's hard to stay on message when you don't agree on the message. Both men were in agreement about the horrors of the GOP, the benefits of health care reform, and the stimulus package. But they got into a disagreement when it came time to talk about whether to extend President Bush's tax cuts on Americans making over $250,000 or let them expire at the end of the year as scheduled. This will be a key issue in the fall as candidates debate what can be done to improve the economy and shrink the deficit. Connolly's 11th District, which includes Fairfax County just across the river from Washington, is the most affluent one in the country (based on median income). He argued for keeping the tax cuts on economic and political grounds. The wealthy provide the bulk of consumer spending that drives the economy, he argued. Why take that spending out of the economy before it has recovered? But his larger point was about the perception of a Democratic Party that wants to soak the rich. ""I think Democrats need to abandon their ideology when it comes to the Bush tax cuts. ... I think this is where Democrats need to reassess their views about who's wealthy,"" he said, pointing out that of the 59 wealthiest districts, Barack Obama carried 47 in 2008. ""These people voted for us. They are our constituents, and yet we have ... almost consistently picked on them to finance a whole plethora of wonderful ideas."" Though the two men share the same state, their districts are very different. In Perriello's 5th District in central Virginia, the median income ($35,700) is less than half that of the 11th District ($80,400). John McCain also won there, whereas Obama won by 15 points in Connolly's district. Perriello favors letting the top-tier tax cuts expire, arguing that the president has done well by his wealthy supporters. ""If you look at who has benefited the most since President Obama came to office, it's been that top percent,"" he said. Some issues of this election may be too complex, and the Democratic caucus too diverse, for Democrats to boil it all down to one easy message. But the two men were in agreement over the power of Obama. They would both welcome him to their district, though Connolly was more enthusiastic than Perriello, ""I need the base excited,"" Connolly said. ""If there's someone who gets the base excited, it's President Obama. President Obama is magic."" Does the White House share that view, Connolly was asked. After a long pause, he said he wasn't sure but thought it might be getting the message. What should the administration do next? ""They have to be out there night and day and stay on message,"" he said. Now if everyone can just agree on the message. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson on Facebook.

11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/07/adios_democrats.html	"For Democrats, the most frightening candidate of 2010 may well be Susana Martinez, the Republican nominee for governor in New Mexico. If she wins in November, she will be the first female Hispanic governor in U.S. history--and an instant national GOP spokeswoman. It is a biennial ritual of punditry to speculate about the direction of the Hispanic vote: ""This election,""a thousand columnists will write, ""Hispanics will truly make a difference."" This is not that piece--well, not quite, anyway. What's notable about this year may be not so much Hispanic voters as Hispanic candidates: specifically, Republican Hispanic candidates. In addition to Martinez, who currently leads in the polls and has been endorsed by Sarah Palin, there's Marco Rubio, the Tea Party favorite who drove Gov. Charlie Crist out of the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in Florida, and Brian Sandoval, a former judge who holds a big lead in the Nevada gubernatorial race. Sure, that's only three candidates. But in the 74 elections this year for governor or U.S. Senate--not all of them competitive--there are no Democratic Hispanic nominees. ""Republicans have done a great job of recruiting Hispanic candidates,"" one Democratic strategist told me. ""They are giving us a big wakeup call this year."" In 2008, Hispanics amounted to 9 percent of the electorate--a record turnout--and went overwhelmingly for Barack Obama and Democrats. This year, the Democratic National Committee is devoting $50 million to getting 2008's first-time voters, principally minorities and young people, to the polls again. ""I hear some folks saying that because there's no immigration reform, Hispanics are going to stay home,"" says Andres Ramirez of NDN, a Washington think tank formerly known as the New Democrat Network. ""Other folks say because there's no immigration reform, Hispanics are going to come out in record numbers, to flex their muscles and show they're still a presence."" Ramirez thinks both arguments miss the point. From 1992 to 2008, he points out, the number of Hispanic voters steadily increased from 2 million to 12 million. This trend, Ramirez says, isn't primarily driven by issues--it's a demographic inevitability. ""An estimated 50,000 Hispanics who are citizens turn 18 every month,"" Ramirez says. ""Census projections say this will be a consistent trend for the next 18 years. There's going to be more Hispanics who engage simply because more are coming into the system."" Democrats say that Hispanic voters won't turn out for the likes of Martinez, Sandoval, and Rubio because of their views on such issues as immigration, which a recent poll says is their top issue in key states. Martinez's campaign ran a television commercial blaming her opponent for giving ""sanctuary to criminal illegals, like child molester Juan Gonzalez""--a spot that drew comparisons to the infamous Willie Horton ad against Michael Dukakis in 1988. Sandoval has said he favors Arizona's tough new illegal-immigration law. Rubio has called for excluding illegal immigrants from the census. Democratic activists say (and hope) Hispanic voters will see past these candidates' last names and be turned off by their rhetoric. But that may be wishful thinking. One Democratic political consultant in Nevada told me canvassers in Las Vegas' heavily Hispanic neighborhoods hear over and over, ""Si, si, Sandoval!"" Never mind that Sandoval doesn't speak Spanish. That didn't stop him from making his first television ad of the general-election campaign a Spanish-language spot titled ""Ya Es Hora"" (""It Is Time"") that ran during the World Cup. ""When Sandoval says things like that he supports the Arizona law, Hispanic voters just assume he's lying to get elected,"" the consultant says. Matt Barreto, a political scientist at the University of Washington who is also a partner in a polling firm called Latino Decisions, has focused much of his research on Hispanic candidates. ""Everything overwhelmingly points to a mobilizing effect for Latino voters,"" he says. ""It is a huge, documented effect, with evidence across states, across types of offices. Latino voters respond, have higher rates of political engagement, are more trusting of government--all those things--when they see themselves represented in elected office."" Barreto's research on this effect builds on work dating to the 1950s, when Irish and Italian last names suddenly started showing up on ballots across the Northeast. ""It was a ploy by both parties to engage white ethnic voters,"" he says. And it worked. Like white ethnic voters, Hispanics stand to benefit from remaining a swing group rather than a base group and from attaining political power themselves rather than being represented by others. It's on that score that Democrats may find some reason for hope. They may not have top Hispanic candidates this year, but the party is home to more than 90 percent of Hispanics in partisan office. At a Democratic Party conference of Latino leaders in Washington in June, the buzz was about people like Linda Chavez-Thompson, a former labor leader running for lieutenant governor in Texas, and Catherine Cortez Masto, the nation's only Hispanic attorney general, who is seeking re-election in Nevada. There are three Democratic Hispanic nominees for statewide offices in New Mexico. But when your top Hispanic contender in the country's most populous state is a candidate for superintendent of public instruction--not exactly an office with the prominence of governor--then you may tend to focus on the number of candidates instead of the offices they're running for. As Democrats look to repeat 2008's historic turnout, they may find that Hispanics will make a big difference in November--but maybe not in quite the way they'd prefer. Like Slate on  Facebook.

Last month, Politico  reported on the fallout from the mess Gen. Stanley McChrystal had made for himself in his interview with Michael Hastings in Rolling Stone. A day later, the Columbia Journalism Review noticed that Politico had removed two key sentences from its article. The deleted passage had speculated that a freelance reporter such as Hastings""would be considered a bigger risk to be given unfettered access, compared with a beat reporter, who would not risk burning bridges by publishing many of McChrystal's remarks.""

Yet it got me wondering: How often does Politico, in the din of the news cycle, make significant changes to its copy after publishing it--without telling readers? Part of the answer, of course, depends on your definition of the word ""significant."" But part of it is simply math. To get the raw numbers, I wrote a series of fairly simple computer programs to monitor changes to all major Politico  articles at regular intervals.

By the end of last week, 217 of the 382 articles (57 percent) tracked had been changed in some way. Because the program detects even the most trivial changes, like the deletion of superfluous white space, the vast majority of these changes were unremarkable. Amid hundreds of these trivial changes, however, we found 12 noteworthy alterations. That amounts to 3.1 percent of the articles we monitored. (We've posted the list in reverse-chronological order.) In the McChrystal meta-controversy--the one about Politico's deletions, not McChrystal's quotes--Politico deputy Managing  Editor Tim Grieve said that he deleted the freelancers-vs.-beat-reporters sentences ""solely for the purposes of keeping the story tight and readable"" while he ""substantially reworked"" the article. *Politico often updates articles continuously, its editors say, as a story evolves.

First White House press secretary Robert Gibbs had to back off his claim that Republicans could retake the House. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her colleagues were furious at Gibbs and complained it was indicative of a general White House indifference to their dire political situation. But by Thursday, to quell the intraparty sniping that had broken into the open, Pelosi went out of her way to praise the president and the White House, saying they've done everything and more to help House members. Looking back on the week, one Democratic operative said one of its lessons was that motivating the base is an inexact science. Indeed, when you're trying to raise money, something like the theory of Schrodinger's cat comes into play: The threat of defeat (whether just in your race or a GOP takeover of the House) has to be alive enough to motivate Democrats to give, but not so alive that people will get discouraged or that your opponents will find hope. The White House has a different view of what motivates the base. It thinks people should be scared into voting for Democrats by the prospect of a Republican House. Pelosi and her team think that merely saying the House is in jeopardy lowers enthusiasm among the party stalwarts. This is an age-old tension. Gibbs merely stated the obvious, that a GOP takeover is a possibility (Gibbs never said it was going to happen). He never backed off that claim because he was merely articulating the underlying message behind the president's political strategy of  the last two months. But boy, did he ever motivate congressional Democrats. They bashed him behind closed doors and to White House aides. At the same time, their anger was about more than just Gibbs. Here are a few of the simmering tensions that have come up in my conversations this week: There is existing tension between the House and the Senate. Some House members believe Senate candidates get more attention from the White House. They're upset because they feel like the Senate always gets preferential treatment. It's not just that House Democrats had to take a tough vote to support cap-and-trade legislation without the Senate following through. There are lots of bills the Senate hasn't picked up, and every time the House Democrats want to do anything, they have to pare back their ambitions because their Senate counterparts need to get 60 votes to do anything. They're also irritated Obama didn't whip the Senate Democrats into line during the drawn-out health care process.The Democratic coalition is so big that tension in a bad election year is inevitable. One particular sore spot is immigration. Blue Dog Democrats don't want the administration to push the issue or fight the Arizona law. The Hispanic caucus and some liberal Democrats do. Pelosi gets an earful. Every time the White House does something even one member hates, he or she feels free to complain to Nancy Pelosi. This means she spends all day hearing about how the White House is ignoring one constituency or another. According to some Hill Democrats, her strong reaction to the Gibbs remarks was in part about showing her constituents that she is taking them seriously.The White House can never do enough. In a tough election year, there are a greater number of Democrats with needs, and those needs are more acute. There just isn't enough time for the president to raise enough money and hold enough events to satisfy all of the nervous Democrats while simultaneously not doing so much that conservative Democrats have to spend all their time answering for his actions. In the back-and-forth, the White House penned a memo outlining all the work administration officials had done on behalf of Democratic candidates which found its way into Politico. Fears about Obama focusing too much on 2012. For months, Democrats have criticized the president for not being tough enough on Republicans. They worry that he and his aides are trying to maintain his post-partisan reputation in order to protect his brand for the re-election rather than sacrificing for this year's contests. It's a bad year. You've heard this before, but it's the template that overlays everything. Only once since FDR has a president's party picked up seats in the midterm elections. Democrats won the last two cycles, and there are a lot of Democrats in unfriendly GOP territory. The economy is bad, and the other party seems more motivated. After a few days proving that Democrats still like to air their dirty laundry in public, by Thursday Democrats were back on the same page. The Democratic National Committee sent around a memo to Democrats highlighting the good news in recent polls. The short take: Obama is more popular than Bush or Clinton before they lost big elections in 1994 and 2006. Republicans are still less popular than the Democrats in Congress or the president. The data leave out a few facts, such as that Republicans are enthusiastic and that key voting blocs who are likely to vote are very unhappy with the president. Still, by the end of the week, Democrats had a new achievement to boast about, the passage of financial regulatory reform. GOP leaders immediately vowed to repeal the law if they came into power. Democrats gleefully seized on the claim as one more reason voters can't allow the Republican Party to win control of the House in November. Not that anyone was willing to admit that might possibly even happen. That's how this whole business got started. Like  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter.

It's not just that the luck of 2006 and 2008--when they gained 30 and 23 seats, respectively--has run out. Conditions have changed. Sure, Democrats control both chambers of Congress and the White House. But President Obama's approval rating is hovering at an anemic 45 percent. The economy isn't seeing the kind of recovery a party in power wants before an election. Meanwhile, Sarah Palin is doing her best to stir up angry voters who might otherwise stay home during an off-year contest. So speculation is running rampant, particularly in the media and especially among Republicans (and White House spokesman Robert Gibbs), that 2010 could be a replay of the Democrats' lowest political moment in the last half-century: the 1994 midterms, when Republicans seized 52 seats in the House and eight in the Senate, taking control of Congress for the first time in 40 years. But the similarities between 2010 and 1994 are superficial. The more relevant election--the one that gives a better gauge of the magnitude of losses the Democrats may see--is the 1982 midterms. Although some political scientists were predicting that the Democrats would gain as many as 50 seats, on Election Day they took only 26 seats from the Republicans. What happened? And could their disappointment of 28 years ago offer reasons for Democrats to hope this year? After all, they're in the same position now--stronger, actually, since they control both houses of Congress--as the Republicans were in 1982. A quick look at three of the most important factors in any midterm election show why 2010 may be for Democrats what 1982 was for Republicans: not great, certainly, but not nearly as bad as it could have been. The economy. In many respects, today's economic conditions are identical to those in 1982. The yearly change in real disposable income per capita is a key factor in predicting midterm outcomes: When their wallets are fuller, people are more likely to send their representatives back to Washington. And right now this number is almost the same as it was at this point in 1982. For the third quarter of 2010, Moody's Economy.com is predicting a 0.4 percent increase in real disposable income per capita from last year--a fairly stagnant number that does not show much economic growth for the average citizen. In the third quarter of 1982, the change in real disposable income per capita was 0.5 percent--also fairly flat. The unemployment rate is also eerily familiar; it's now pushing 10 percent, while in 1982 it was 9.7 percent. In 1994, meanwhile, the economy was in better shape than it is now or was in 1982, with a 6.1 percent unemployment rate and 2.3 percent increase in personal disposable income from the third quarter of 1993. Campaign spending. In 1982, one of the ways Republicans were able to fend off the Democratic attack was by achieving parity on campaign spending for challengers--both parties spent an average of $141,000. (You can find these data on JSTOR; login required.)  It's true that, as a group, Democratic challengers did better than Republican challengers (attributed to the fact that they often ran in Democratic-leaning districts). But if Republicans had skimped on those races, Democrats probably would have come closer to their predicted 40- to 50-seat pickup. Meanwhile, in 1994, Republican challengers outspent Democratic challengers by an average of $244,042 to $152,659 and by a margin of $40,000 on open seats (data again from JSTOR). This year, although the National Republican Congressional Committee outspent the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in May, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee outspent their Republican counterparts. The DNC and DCCC also had more cash on hand at the end of the month, which will help them later in the election. Without outspending the Democrats, it is unlikely the Republicans will be able to achieve all the pickups they are hoping for. Messaging. Perhaps the most compelling reason why 2010 won't be another 1994 is the current state of the Republican Party.With the economy the major focus of this election--as it was in 1982--the sitting president has much more power to present a unified voice on behalf of the party. This is something that both Reagan did and Obama has done well. The conventional wisdom holds that a bad economy casts a dark cloud over the party in power, but 1982 shows the cloud's silver lining. The depths of the economic problems that year gave the president nearly unlimited open-mic time to talk to the American people--and present a coherent strategy on behalf of his party. By November 1982, Reagan had given six speeches from the Oval Office about the economy, explaining to Americans how he and Republicans were trying to solve the problem. Obama has given no Oval Office speeches on the economy, but it has been the topic of 106 speeches and appearances--and the subject of his recent campaign trail rhetoric. And, just as with Reagan, many Americans do not place the blame for the economic problems with Obama. Even with a job approval rating in the mid-40s and stagnant personal disposable income, Reagan and the Republicans avoided a walloping, and Obama might too. In 1994, in contrast, Clinton lost control of the national conversation. Congress did pass a huge tax-cutting and -raising bill in Clinton's first year. But despite his unofficial campaign slogan (""It's the economy, stupid""), Clinton spent a lot of time in the first two years of his term on controversial projects unrelated to the economy (a crime bill, a failed health care bill, a failed attempt to lift the ban on gays in the military). This opened avenues of failure for the Republicans to exploit. Led by Newt Gingrich and his Contract With America, they blanketed the country with their message. Not only was Gingrich successful in promoting a unified message, particularly among challengers; he also helped his party reach voters in new ways, with previously underused media like talk radio. That kind of message mastery was essential to the Republicans' capture of 52 House seats. This year, the Republican Party is deeply divided in its upper echelons of leadership--and people like RNC Chairman Michael Steele certainly aren't helping the party define or stay on message. Additionally, the Republicans (far more than the Democrats) have had to contend with the distractions of the Tea Partiers, whose candidates have the potential to steal away the conservative voters on which the Republicans rely so heavily. A recent Gallup poll highlighted the steep overlap between the Tea Partiers and the Republican base. Republicans this year have to fend off charges from the right and the left instead of just being able to focus on the attack. As Robert Gibbs says, it's certainly possible that the Democrats will lose the House this year, like they did in 1994. But from an economic standpoint, this year more closely resembles 1982. And the president--a Democrat now, a Republican then--seems similarly disciplined. All the party in power has to do is spend some money and hope that this year turns out to be less bad than everyone predicts. LikeSlate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

16	16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/08/five_myths_about_the_tea_party.html	"The grass-roots conservative activists who march under the ""Don't tread on me"" Gadsden flag and the Tea Party label have put a new twist on Gandhi's maxim *: First they were ignored; then they were ridiculed; then they began to fight. They battled health-care reform and then the Republican establishment, which became angry about the less-than-seasoned candidates it was suddenly saddled with. In short order, a movement that few people took seriously has become the most obsessed-over and overanalyzed political backlash since the 1960s. And as long as both parties are grappling with it and publishers are putting out Tea Party books every month, it's worth busting a few myths about the movement. The Tea Party isn't a reaction to President Obama, it's a reaction to the bank bailouts.There are some kernels of truth here. The first modern Tea Party events occurred in December 2007, long before Barack Obama took office, and they were organized by supporters of Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, to raise money for his long-shot presidential bid. They received the respectful, hey-look-at-that coverage sometimes given a candidate flipping pancakes at a church social. Some of the people recognized as leaders of the Tea Party movement, such as FreedomWorks Chairman Dick Armey, have loudly condemned the 2008 financial-sector rescue package. And several members of Congress, such as Sen. Bob Bennett (Utah), have been  unable to survive  their TARP votes when facing GOP primary voters. Here's the thing, though: The tea parties were kicked off by CNBC reporter  Rick Santelli's rant  about, of all things, Obama's Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan, an effort to lessen the damage to people who'd taken out mortgages they couldn't afford. And it picked up steam when conservative groups fired up activists about energy and health-care legislation--the Obama agenda, not a last-ditch conservative plan to rescue the banking industry. If you think the tea party would have risen up to oppose a Republican president who spent like mad and violated conservative principles, then where was it in the Bush years? The Tea Party is racist.It's a phenomenon that some activists call ""nutpicking""--send a cameraman into a protest and he'll focus on the craziest sign. Yes, there are racists in the Tea Party, and they make themselves known. But Tea Party activists usually root them out. Texas activist Dale Robertson, who held a sign likening taxpayers to a racial epithet at a 2009 rally, was drummed out of that event and pilloried by his peers. Mark Williams, formerly the bomb-throwing spokesman for the Tea Party Express (he once told me he wanted to send the liberal watchdog group Media Matters ""a case of champagne"" for calling him racist), was booted after penning a parody that had the NAACP pining for slavery. Liberal critics of the tea party argue that conservative opposition to social spending is often racially motivated. That's not new, though, and it's not the basis for the tea party. Sarah Palin is the leader of the Tea Party.After she and John McCain lost the 2008 election, and after eight  unhappy months  back at work governing Alaska, Sarah Palin took her time to re-enter politics. She spent the last half of 2009 writing Facebook posts that, for all the attention they got, mostly praised the work of people such as Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn. It wasn't until this past February,  at the National Tea Party Convention  in Nashville, that Palin picked up the movement's banner. Her credentials aren't ideal: Tea Partiers unanimously agree that the TARP was what turned America's decline into a freefall; as a vice presidential candidate, Palin backed the TARP. But she showed plenty of political savvy and hitched herself to the movement, and reporters, eager to find a party politics angle to the Tea Party story--and knowing that Palin's name brings traffic to news Web sites--anointed her. Palin has more devoted fans than any other Republican politician, but according to an April New York Times/CBS News poll, only 40 percent of self-identified Tea Party activists think she would be an ""effective chief executive."" They'd like to be leaderless for now, thank you very much. But the Tea Party Nation, which planned the Nashville event, and the Tea Party Express, which invited the former governor to rallies in Nevada and Massachusetts, knew they could get media to show up if Palin came along, and they won't forget that lesson. The Tea Party hurts the GOPSen. Lindsey Graham predicted recently that the tea party movement  will ""die out.""  Rep. Bob Inglis, R-S.C., who lost his primary race to a Tea Party-backed candidate, has made the media rounds to accuse the movement and some of its heroes, such as Glenn Beck, of poisoning politics. There is no shortage of Republican grumbling about the primary wins of Tea Partiers  Sharron Angle in Nevada  and  Rand Paul in Kentucky, two Senate candidates who are being hammered by Democrats for their anti-big-government rhetoric. Democrats are doing their best to make Republicans answer for it when tea party activists pledge to dismantle Social Security or the Environmental Protection Agency. But in every political cycle there are ""bad"" candidates who say the wrong things--and with the right electorate, they still win. The Tea Party movement is giving Republicans a dream of an electorate, one in which  surveys find more GOP-inclined voters enthusiastic  about casting ballots than voters who lean Democratic. Democrats have done some damage to the Tea Party brand--its favorability has fallen in polls--but in general, the presence of a new political force that is not called Republican and is not tied to George W. Bush has given the GOP a glorious opportunity to remake its image, at a time when trust in the party is very low. Some liberals deride the Tea Party as a new bottle for old Republican wine. But rebranding works. (Even Coca-Cola eventually benefited from the publicity of New Coke.) The Tea Party will transform American politics.Here, Sen. Graham has history on his side. A popular, and correct, aphorism about grass-roots movements is that they act like bees--they sting, then they die. Third parties fold into major parties, like the 19th century Populists did with the Democrats. The Tea Party is unlikely to even reach third-party status, because the vast majority of its members--up to 79 percent, in some polls--identify as Republicans and are savvy enough not to take actions that would help Democrats. (Liberals only wish that Ralph Nader thought like this.) The movement's big innovations, such as fast organizing, are mostly technological, inspired by and improving on Obama's 2008 campaign. Their demands are really the same ones that conservative Republicans were making after Obama won, and that Rush Limbaugh and most GOP lawmakers were already making, too. So the Tea Party will succeed, if it hasn't already, in making one of America's political parties more devoted to supply-side, pro-war-on-terror, anti-spending principles. But it was pushing on an open door. This article also appears in the Washington Post's ""Outlook"" section. Like  Slate  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter.

Charlie Rangel, D.-N.Y., and Maxine Waters, D.-Calif., threaten to darken an already-gloomy year for Democrats. Both of the accused have shaken off formal reprimands in favor of a public proceeding before a House subcommittee that can issue punishments as severe as expulsion. While it's unlikely that either lawmaker will receive the ultimate punishment, there are plenty of Democrats who wish Rangel and Waters would do the party a favor and expel themselves. The question of what will persuade a given politician to resign when he or she is embroiled in a scandal hinges on complex political arithmetic. How vulnerable is the party in the next election? How vulnerable is the politician? Are there compromising photos? Is the politician in question given to moralizing about the very sin of which he or she stands accused? The path of political scandal being well-trodden, the patterns of human behavior in this realm are more predictable than you might suppose.

Not enough of his fellow Republicans came with him. Gingrich's party lost five seats in the House of Representatives after a year exploring impeachment charges against President Bill Clinton. Gingrich, who was House speaker, acknowledged the unexpected setback by announcing his resignation. His final act of power was to call a lame-duck session of Congress to deal with the impeachment. Democrats were horrified and helpless. As far as they were concerned, the election had been a referendum on impeachment, and the Republicans had lost it. Republicans who were retiring or being replaced by Democrats were going to provide votes for impeachment that wouldn't be there when the new, Gingrich-free Congress took over in January. ""Listen to the American people,"" said Democratic investigative counsel Abbe Lowell, one of many members of his party who spent weeks wringing hands, pointing at polls, and watching the impeachment train chug along. One week before Christmas the majority party held votes on four articles of impeachment, passing two of them. Gingrich cast his final votes in the House for all four articles. Two weeks later, he departed. This is well-remembered Washington history, and it wraps plenty of yellow ""CAUTION"" tape around Gingrich's newest cause. His latest petition--a sequel and supplement to campaigns by the Tea Party groups FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity--asks conservatives to send the following pledge to their members of Congress."

19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/08/black_tea.html	"When the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People introduced a resolution calling on the Tea Party movement to ""condemn extremist elements,"" I wondered what possible good it would do. How might it help liberals who felt frustrated, increasingly, that their attacks on ""racism"" in the new conservative movement were never taken seriously? The resolution didn't do much for the NAACP, but it did plenty for liberals. Three weeks later, after the Shirley Sherrod mess, and after the implosion of Mark Williams, spokesman for the Sacramento-based Tea Party Express, conservatives are still bristling at the charge of Tea Party ""racism."" On Wednesday morning, Williams' old organization organized a two-and-a-half-hour event at the National Press Club in order to rebut the charge the best way it knew how--with a chorus line of black conservatives attacking anyone who dared call the Tea Party racist. ""The left has wielded racism like a dirty nuclear weapon, destroying whole cities and the hopes and dreams of many Americans, not just black Americans,"" said Kevin Jackson, a self-published author and blogger who calls himself ""a leader in the consulting industry in America"" and frequently appears on talk radio. ""It's time that reign of terror ended."" Jackson spoke calmly, giving the crowd some time to applaud his jokes, sporting the same tan suit/black shirt combo he wore for the cover of his book, The Big Black Lie. Looking on were more than a dozen black conservative activists from organizations that are known, if they are known at all, as the ones booked on cable news to give the Other Perspective when race and politics take over the news cycle. It was a snapshot of the reverse-racism grievance industry, a far-flung and much-interviewed network of black conservatives who profess to believe--as Stephen Colbert professes, less seriously, to believe--that racism can be ended in America if people stop obsessing over it. ""Being called a racist is the single most damaging charge for any American,"" said Niger Innis, the national spokesman for the Congress of Racial Equality, a major player in the civil rights struggle that since the late 1960s has been aligned with the right. ""Because of this new phenomenon, the NAACP, in a betrayal of its own legacy, and in a betrayal of black Americans, has now adopted the tactic it was formed to fight in the first place--racial terror! The same racial terror that was employed by whites in hoods is now being employed by blacks and whites in suits! The terror is employed against Americans who want to exercise their First Amendment rights."" This was not the morning's only reference to the KKK, and none of those references caused much of a stir. Black conservatives have been making this case for decades, with limited success. Liberals dismiss them as plants or dupes; they double down and say this proves just how racist and plantation-minded white and black liberals really are. AlfonZo Rachel, a black comedian and star of the conservative video site PJTV, accused Democrats of using blacks as ""ballot cattle,"" forever to be kept poor and voting the right way. ""The NAACP is basically made up of the same kind of people who'd rat out a runaway slave,"" said Rachel. ""We're the ones who don't have chains on our brains, and they hate us for it."" ""They"" are the overwhelming majority of African-Americans. In the Gallup Poll, President Obama has enjoyed approval ratings among black voters as high as 96 percent. His lowest low came in the aftermath of the firing of Shirley Sherrod, the USDA administrator let go after a video of a speech she gave to the NAACP was edited to make it sound as though she'd mistreated a poor white farmer. Obama's rating dipped to 85 percent, reflecting the anger of many people who felt she was whipsawed by conservative media like Fox News and Andrew Breitbart's BigGovernment.com. Obama's bounced back since then, although Rachel didn't let Sherrod off the hook when a reporter suggested that the Sherrod tape was ""doctored"" by a conservative. She might have patched things up with that white farmer, but she wasn't colorblind. ""Doctored it? Ma'am, if he doctored it, he did her a favor, because if you look at the whole tape, you'll find out just how racist Shirley Sherrod is."" The Tea Party movement has produced a bumper crop of black conservative stars. Fox News pundit Angela McGlowan, one of the more successful proponents of the ""Democratic plantation"" argument, rode her Tea Party stardom to a congressional bid that was endorsed by Sarah Palin (although that wasn't enough to win her the primary). Retired Lt. Col. Allen West, who ran an unsuccessful congressional campaign in 2008, has become a Tea Party superstar this time around, translating his fame into one of the best-funded challenges of the cycle. The National Press Club event was emceed by Lloyd Marcus, a Florida singer (press materials informed reporters that he wrote a near-miss candidate for official state song) who has become one of the Tea Party Express' stars, with all of the cable TV time that's worth. But the NAACP's attack rattled them. The Tea Party Express' spokesman Mark Williams, a former radio host who bragged about his ability to torque off the media, decided the best way to respond to the resolution was with a satirical essay, written from the NAACP's perspective, making the case for slavery. He was gone within days, as other Tea Party groups--with leaders who had criticized Williams' incendiary comments about Obama for months--put distance between themselves and Williams. On Wednesday, it was left to William Owens, another TPE organizer, to explain that the group acted slowly because Williams was a ""friend."" ""If my white brother was to use the word--now, bear with me--nigger, in a friendly and playful way towards my black brothers, he would be seen as a racist,"" said Owens. ""But if my black brother used the same jovial banter, no one would see him that way. ... The word racist has lost its meaning."" This, though, is the limitation of the professional black conservative. The issue he or she talks about the most is not so much race as it is political correctness. And when he or she is asked to talk, it's in response to something the NAACP or a civil rights spokesman has said or done. The charge that prompted this press conference had to be answered, but the activists made their task harder than it had to be by challenging the premise that there was any racism in the Tea Party. Shannon Travis, a CNN reporter who had embedded with the Tea Party Express, asked the activists to respond to the signs and slogans that liberals saw as emblems of Tea Party racism. Bob Parks, a producer at the conservative Media Research Center, replied, ""You have people who actually bring signs in, stick them up, and have people take pictures of them to show they were there. Or you have people who, in the convenience of their home, Photoshop them. And you're still falling for it!"" The activists explained the racial imagery in some Tea Party signs by arguing that it wasn't racial. Robert Broadus, a congressional candidate for a safe Democratic seat in Maryland, argued that an image of Barack Obama as a witch doctor was simply a statement about health care reform. I asked Owens whether questioning Obama's citizenship--as Williams used to--was racist. ""It's not racist at all!"" said Owens. ""It's just an issue of proper documentation, to show you're a citizen."" Broadus agreed but suggested that the Obama doubters were ""clutching at straws."" That they even had to discuss this, though, rankled the activists. That journalists were asking about this proved that the media were still taking cues from the NAACP and that the job of battling the civil rights hustlers was as all-consuming as ever. On the way out, Niger Innis of CORE admitted that he preferred discussing issues--the 14th Amendment, for example--but that explaining why liberals were the real racists was too important to avoid. He repeated what he said when a listener chastised him for going on TV to talk about ""hyphenated-Americans,"" instead of being colorblind. ""I empathize with you dropping the hyphen,"" said Innis, ""and I'm for that, but we have to let white America see black people condemning the NAACP."" Like Slate on  Facebook.

Lindsey Graham last week proposed amending the Constitution to change the law that grants citizenship to the children of immigrants born in the United States. More specifically, he would change the language of the 14th Amendment to bar birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented parents. Graham's Senate Republican colleagues John McCain, Jon Kyl, and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell all agree that hearings should be held on the proposal. This effort is just the latest evidence of how insincere they are about supporting a meaningful attempt at immigration reform, opting instead for pointless political chest-thumping. They cannot be serious about amending the 14th Amendment (which may explain why key Republicans are already backing away from the proposal). The Constitution can only be amended in two ways: The first is for a bill to pass both houses of Congress, by a two-thirds majority. Good luck with that, especially in this age of partisan politics. Once the bill has passed both houses, then it's on to the states for approval. Congress will normally put a time limit (typically seven years) for the bill to be approved as an amendment that must be ratified by three-fourths of states. Again, good luck. The second method requires that a constitutional convention be called by two-thirds of the legislatures of the states. Any amendments adopted would then be sent to the states to be approved by three-fourths of the legislatures. This route has never been taken, and there is concern in political science circles about just how such a convention would even be convened and the can of political worms it could open. The last serious effort at a constitutional amendment was the Equal Rights Amendment. The proposal, intended to guarantee that equal rights under any federal, state, or local law could not be denied on account of gender, was passed by both houses of Congress in 1972. But only 35 of the required 38 states ratified the change. Thus, the amendment failed even after a controversial extension of the ratification period. I seriously doubt that the American public has either the interest in, or the stomach for, a long, drawn-out constitutional debate about birthright citizenship. Polls show the public favors the anti-immigrant Arizona SB1070 but overwhelmingly supports legalization for undocumented immigrants as well. Apparently, the majority of the public is open to having a real conversation about immigration policy and solving the undocumented immigration challenge. This attack on U.S. born children--or, per the ugly moniker, ""anchor babies""? That's just a distraction. Challenges to birthright citizenship are not new. They emerge in predictable historical cycles. Like other attention-grabbing anti-immigrant initiatives, they may even spark debate, but not the kind of honest discussion necessary for immigration reform. Proposals couched in enforcement-only, anti-immigrant sentiment naturally encounter reflexive push-back from immigrant rights supporters advocating legalization. That's why the polarized battle over closing the border and increasing enforcement, versus enacting a legalization program, leaves little room for meaningful conversation. For any real change to come about, we must talk about the needs of employers and the contributions of immigrants. The vitriol about pregnant foreigners who sneak across our borders prevents us from getting an accurate picture of who most immigrants are--both documented and undocumented--and why they continue to arrive instead of trying to achieve their dreams at home. For example, our instincts tell us that reducing the flow across the southern border will require the expansion of the economy and job growth in Mexico. Yet formulating a plan to work with Mexico on its economy has never been part of the discussion. The real problem with the enforcement-only approach to the undocumented immigration challenge is obvious: It's pretty much all we've been doing for the past decade, and what's the result been? Billions of dollars later, we are left with daily deaths at the border, as an enforcement regime funnels the continuous flow of migrants through the most treacherous terrain and ICE raids. Our borders separate loved ones as detention facilities bulge to the breaking point. Congress is currently sitting on Senate and House proposals for reform that attempt to strike a principled balance between greater enforcement and a fair way to adjust the status for the 10 million to 12 million undocumented immigrants in the country. However, even immigrant rights advocates must acknowledge that legalization will not solve undocumented migration permanently. An expansion of visas will certainly help, but if the package does not include at least the first steps toward helping Mexico improve its economy and infrastructure, undocumented Mexican migration will continue, and the tension over undocumented migration will resurface down the road. Given our experience with recent politicized debates over health care and financial reform, as framed, the immigration proposals in the Senate and the House will invite only predictable criticism from the right and the left: Those in the immigrant rights camp will complain about proposals to increase enforcement through biometric cards, stepped-up ICE raids, and enhanced militarization of the border. Anti-immigrant forces will reject anything that suggests an amnesty for ""law breakers,"" including a temporary guest worker program. But if serious consideration were to be given to a long-range economic strategy with Mexico, I believe conservatives and liberals alike would have reason to collaborate. Fewer Mexican workers would want or need to leave their country looking for work--making conservatives happy. And Mexican workers--the vast majority of whom would rather stay home--would have options, making liberals happy. To truly understand undocumented migration, we have to do what Americans have thus far been unwilling to do: Look beyond the simple explanation that migrants cross the border in search of work. We have to ask why they cannot find what they want in Mexico. In 1994, we were told that NAFTA would solve the undocumented problem because new jobs would be created in Mexico. But NAFTA ultimately contributed to huge job losses in Mexico. Mexican corn farmers could not compete with heavily subsidized U.S. corn farmers, and now Mexico imports most of its corn from the United States. Because of globalization, 100,000 jobs in Mexico's domestic manufacturing sector were lost from 1993 to 2003. Where do those unemployed workers look for work? El Norte. A comparison with Europe is instructive here. When the European Union experienced pressure to expand its ranks to include poorer nations, the wealthier members worried. EU membership includes the right to open labor migration, and wealthy countries fretted that membership would bring a flood of poor workers across their borders. So beginning with the 1973 EU enlargement to include Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, the British insisted on an approach to aid poorer regions. When Greece (1981), then Portugal and Spain (1986), were added, all three nations as well as Ireland received infusions of capital and assistance with institutional planning. This approach worked. Their economies transformed, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain--all of which were emigrant-sending nations prior to EU membership--are now net immigrant-receiving nations. Today, only 2 percent of EU citizens look for work in other EU countries. One other useful lesson? The EU strategy of providing ""adhesion"" funds was forged by conservatives and liberals working together, rather than at cross purposes. The anti-immigrant lobby has used the politics of fear to generate much of the hysteria over immigration today. They advance the specter of hordes of immigrants coming to take our jobs and commit crimes, while refusing to speak English. Of course the empirical data undercut those myths. Yet through fear and intimidation, comprehensive immigration reform has been stalled for years. An economic turnaround in Mexico is central to solving the undocumented migration challenge in the United States. Conservatives should understand that. And liberals should recognize that reducing undocumented migration is in Mexico's interest as well; the persistent loss of able-bodied workers needed to build its infrastructure and economy only hurts Mexico. To be sure, investment in Mexico will not and, probably, should not be done without close monitoring. The EU enlargement policy sets standards for candidate countries. These criteria require a country that wishes to join the EU to meet certain political, social, and economic standards. We need a similar strategy in our own hemisphere. The longer we put this off, the worse the immigration crisis becomes. Raising the issue of birthright citizenship--indeed the prospect of years of congressional hearings followed by years wasted attempting to amend the Constitution--doesn't do much beyond stirring up more hostility toward undocumented immigrants. Worse yet, it distracts us yet again from the meaningful discourse that might truly solve the problem. If key Republicans really want to launch a discussion about the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, then fine. What they will find is a group of young adults who are English speakers, good neighbors, and hard workers and who contribute importantly to the economy and to our society. In short, they will find Americans, who should be protected by the Constitution, not persecuted by it. Like Slate on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter."

21	21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/08/not_sarah_palins_friends.html	"The comments on Sarah Palin's Facebook page offer a relatively unbroken chain of adulation, applause, and approval: ""Tell it LIKE IS MRS. PALIN."" ""God Bless you Sarah!! Thanks for all you do!!"" ""Palin 2012!!!!"" No matter the topic of her posting--an endorsement of a candidate or a remark about energy policy--scores call for her to run for office. It should not surprise you that the comments to posts she makes on her page are screened. For any high-profile politician, online comments are like town hall forums: Both appear to be spontaneous but are actually highly choreographed. In presidential town hall meetings, people sit in high-school gymnasiums and wear flannel as they jockey for the microphone. They almost seem genuine, but as they ask questions, it becomes clear they have been carefully selected. Each question to the candidate features the same sentiment: You're pretty wonderful, aren't you? Palin's Facebook page  is a key tool in her public brand management. She has used it effectively to project her message, appear connected with voters, and bypass the traditional media (while simultaneously using it to rebroadcast her message). In a recent Facebook post, she celebrated her 2 millionth fan on the site and the size of her reach. ""Two million! Wow! That's more than some cable news shows. Thank you all and let's keep the momentum!"" How much work does it take to keep everything so sanitized? To help me find out, my colleague Jeremy Singer-Vine wrote a program to capture comments to Palin's page before the clean-up crew could arrive. (Here's an explanation of how Jeremy's program works.) All these posts were initially public, if only for a few minutes. We looked at the comments to 10 Palin posts over 12 days, capturing the deletions in the 24 hours after the posts were live. In that period, a rough average of 10 percent of total posts were deleted. The deletions amount to a real-time look at how much effort and care Palin puts into protecting her public image. It's not just the number of posts that are screened out that gives some indication of how seriously Palin's team is monitoring things. The superfine mesh through which posts are sifted also gives an indication of the work involved. You don't get erased just for using vulgarity or pushing spam (which Facebook might remove anyway if flagged). The kinds of posts that are likely to get you removed from the Palin comments section can be divided into categories (the comments have not been edited): Mean comments about Sarah Palin. ""Please go away from my wall.  I do not like you or agree with any dumb thing you say or do."" Mean things about the people who say mean things about Sarah Palin. ""if you dont like her posts LEAVE THE GROUP DUMBASS!!!!"" Racial or ethnic slurs. ""America's greatest threat is Marxism and International Jewry/Zionism!  We will never regain our Liberty and Freedom until we expel every Jew from America!"" Polite disagreement. ""Sarah, perception is everything! I learned that in the military. All you have to do is disassociate yourself from those Tea Partiers that are indeed racist and the NAACP gones [sic] away,"" wrote one in response to Palin's post on the NAACP's charge that the Tea Party tolerated racism. ""Even they [the NAACP] admit the Tea Party is not a racist organization. Mrs. Palin, I believe you to be an honorable Woman. You believe in your cause. Sometimes for the good of the cause one has to make a stand even to those that support the cause. Remember John Mccain, circa 2008 in which a woman stood up and called Candidate Obama a Muslim. The Honorable John Mccain rebuked her. This could be your moment."" Too much agreement. ""Do us a favor Sarah, trap a few Wolves and ship em to D.C., they do eat Rats don't they?  Have a great trip Sarah, God Bless."" Criticism of her children. ""please dont let your daughter do a reality show :(but i love your family and you ..hope thats just a rumor from the liberals."" Anything about Obama's birth certificate or conspiracies related thereto, even in muted form. ""Just so we're clear, Conspiracy theories about Obama's refusal to release his college records--lunacy. Conspiracy theories about Trig Palin--journalism."" Complaints about her endorsements of so many female candidates. ""I am beginning not to like you (Sarah). You have endorsed every women candidate running. You are looking quite biased."" (Actually, she's endorsed as many men as women.) Excessive use of religious prophesy or imagery. ""The ones I feel for is one day those in the media that are doing the way they are will come down .you are a threat to them and their evil ways. David only needed 5 stones to bring down the giant. and i belive those five stones had on them five letters JESUS. The road may get hard but one day you will know God gave you that to walk."" There are a host of benign posts deleted from supporters who simply disagreed with the person Palin chose to endorse in a particular note. A typical one addressed her endorsement of Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire for U.S. Senate: ""I can't believe Sarah endorsed Ayotte. Ayotte is not a Momma Grizzley, she's just another progressive in Rep. clothing. The 912 group I belong to and some of the other groups in the state are disappointed by this endorsement."" This caused a little stir among the commenters. ""Why are the few comments expressing disagreement with this endorsement being deleted?"" wrote one. "" Just because some of us disagree with the endorsement doesn't mean that we don't follow Sarah Palin."" Alfred Petross wrote, ""I just wish you would listen to me as a resident of the 3rd Congressional District.  All I am doing is voicing my opinion and my posts keep getting deleted...."" (These comments were then deleted.) ""Having my posts deleted were extremely disappointing,"" says Petross, who went on to post his letter to Palin on his Facebook page, ""because I was under the impression that Sarah Palin was in fact a political activist who was all about hearing the opinions and voices of the constituents of the United States."" Though recent deletions seem heavy on these voices of protest, Palin's screener doesn't take out every voice of dissent. Indeed, the outcry over her endorsement of Carly Fiorina for the U.S. Senate in California prompted Palin to respond to her fans. My efforts to get some insight from Palin's camp have so far gone unanswered. (Given how prolific Palin has been, and how carefully the posts are screened, they could be too busy.) This leaves us without explanations for some intriguing deletions. ""Hey all Sarah fans! Come and 'like' Mike Huckabee on Facebook. Like Sarah, he is a common sense conservative. Sarah and Mike have ideas that will save this great nation."" Many posts make innocuous requests that readers support causes or read Web pages. So why was this one about a potential rival for the Republican presidential nomination deleted? Palin is far more rigorous with her Facebook friends than most other political figures. Mitt Romney, Michele Bachmann,* and Scott Brown get the familiar trolls and mischief, but those comments stay on the page. (Over on Rand Paul's page, one poster is wishing cancer on another.) President Obama's page is perhaps the only other one that is so carefully tended. Though when we looked at the deletions on Obama's page, they were less than 1 percent of comments posted and surprisingly rather benign: ""We the People are NOT unertaxed...YOU, Mr Obama are spending too much!"" Palin is a polarizing figure, which makes this kind of curation necessary to guard her reputation and keep her from being linked (literally if not figuratively) to anything controversial. There's no reason she should be responsible for the nutty posts on her Facebook page, but that doesn't mean her opponents won't try to put them there and then make her guilty by association. She's also wise to scrub the offensive posts of the kind the Republican National Committee only recently removed. So Palin never allows anything that might be considered mildly controversial. Political strategists say that it's often hard to talk long-shot candidates  out of running for office because they have so many friends and hangers-on telling them they deserve to be president. If that's true, then there's no political strategist alive who could persuade Sarah Palin not to run for president. She has 2 million Facebook friends telling her otherwise. *Correction, Aug. 3, 2010: This article originally misspelled Michele Bachmann's first name.

22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/07/redhanded.html	"It's the first rule of politics: Don't take dirty money. Just kidding, of course. You'd think that would be the rule. But politicians take dirty money all the time. So when a big political donor gets in trouble--as the Texas billionaires Samuel and Charles Wyly did Thursday, when the SEC charged them with $550 million worth of securities fraud--every politician they ever gave money to has to make a calculation: keep the cash or give it away? Over the past 20 years, the Wylys gave nearly $2.5 million to 192 top Republicans, including both Presidents Bush, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Phil Gramm, Dick Armey, John Cornyn, John McCain, Sam Brownback, Judd Gregg, John Thune, and Kit Bond, plus various GOP committees, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. So far, the only person to publicly return the money was John McCain, who gave back $20,000 in 2006 when he learned the Wylys were under investigation. The rest have yet to make a decision. Which is understandable! It's tough to decide if you should return--or, in many cases, give to charity--money that might be tainted. Here are a few factors politicians must consider. Are you running for re-election? If dirty money falls into your bank account and no one notices, is it unethical? Good question. But it's purely theoretical. If you're trying to get re-elected--and unless you've announced your retirement, you are--someone will notice. That's why candidates offload tainted funds as fast as possible. ""You have to ask what's worth more to you, the $2,000 or the freedom of your opponent to attack you?"" says Dave Levinthal of the CRP. That explains McCain's decision to offload the Wyly money in 2006, as he was mulling a presidential run. Obama, too, returned at least $85,000 raised by Chicago developer Tony Rezko. Are you vulnerable? When California billionaire Henry Samueli pled guilty to stock fraud in 2008, two members of Congress refused to give back the money he'd donated to them. Those two members--Rep. Jim Moran of Virginia and Sen. Joseph Lieberman--also happen to occupy some of the safest Democratic seats in the country. (Moran, who has served since 1991, won 68 percent of the vote in 2008; despite a tough primary, Lieberman won the general election handily in 2006.) Moran said at the time that it was a question of standing by his supporter: ""Frankly, I'm proud that he saw fit to contribute to me, and I don't intend to try to embarrass him by sending him back the money."" How much money did you take? The more you took, the more likely you are to return it. (Even though it might be harder to part with big money.) When Democratic donor Norman Hsu was charged with fraud and went on the lam, Hillary Clinton gave the $23,000 she had received to charity and returned to donors the $850,000 Hsu had ""bundled"" for her. But she declined to return the $5,000 donated by Houston oilman Oscar Wyatt after he was charged with fraud and conspiracy in connection to the United Nations ""oil-for-food"" scandal. Was the donor actually convicted? How painful would it be to return the money, only to have the person be acquitted? That's why politicians often wait to see how bad the damage is. In 2007, John Edwards gave away $4,600 donated by trial lawyer William Lerach, but only after he pleaded guilty to a federal conspiracy charge. Have you already spent the money? If the money's just not there, it's hard to return it. At least that's the argument many politicians make. (Yes, money is fungible, etc.--enough with the reasonable counterarguments!) For example, the Wylys gave money to Rep. Dick Armey's PAC in 2001 and 2002. But after Armey left Congress, the fund shut down. ""That's so far gone, it's almost a decade ago,"" said Adam Brandon, a spokesman for Armey's group FreedomWorks. Same goes for the money donated by embattled Democratic titan Hassan Nemazee to two New York institutions, the Spence School and the Asia Society, both of which refused to return the cash after Nemazee pleaded guilty to fraud. A lawyer for Spence said that ""the funds were spent long ago."" What's the other side saying? When Nemazee was charged with lying about his assets to secure a $74 million loan, the National Republican Senatorial Committee called on Senate Democrats to ""return any and all contributions that they received from this disgraced financier to preserve the integrity of fundraising efforts in 2010."" (Many did.) But now that Republicans are in the same position with the Wylys, they might not have to give anything back. Why? Because Democrats are in no position to attack them for shady ethics--at least not until Rep. Charlie Rangel's woes recede from the front pages. Until then, if Democrats threaten to make the Wyly money an issue, Republicans can say, go for it. We dare you. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/07/what_should_obama_read.html	"In a few weeks, President Obama will start his summer vacation on Martha's Vineyard. (Before arriving, he'll spend a weekend enjoying Florida's oil-free beaches.) What should he take for beach reading? This is a conundrum for any bookish person, but particularly for the president, whose every move is assessed for meaning. What do Obama's picks say about the state of race in America? How will the independent voter react? Will he use a Kindle or an iPad? The White House usually releases the president's reading list on the eve of the trip, providing the first item in what the president and the traveling press corps hope will be a week and a half of low-impact news coverage. Last summer we wrote about the meaning of President Obama's reading list. We also wrote about Bush's list. We're threatening to revive the parlor game this year. But before we do, we'd like to host a contest. We're asking Slate readers to help choose the president's summer reading list. After all, he's received so much unsolicited advice so far, it just wouldn't feel right to leave any aspect of his presidency, however insignificant, unadvised-upon. (The bookstores on the Vineyard aren't likely to miss the chance. They'll send over a basket of books, as they did last year and when Bill Clinton visited as president.) Your objective is the president's: A set of books that will both entertain and not open him to a lot of grief in the press. The latter may be impossibility, but the public is not too sensitive.  After all, President Bush, in the middle of two wars in the Middle East and declining U.S. image in that region, picked as one of his summer reads a tale about a youthful layabout who became an unrepentant Arab killer *: Albert Camus's The Stranger. Another thing to keep in mind while making your choices is that at least one of the authors should probably be a woman. Obama picked only male writers last year, but this is an election year, and control of Congress may hang in the balance on this crucial question. (Although press secretary Robert Gibbs is not allowed to admit this in public.) Here's how it will work. On the form below, submit anywhere from one to five books as your choices (feel free to add a brief rationale as well). Or, if you prefer, you can submit your choice via Twitter (in fewer than 140 characters, of course) with the hashtag #obamareads. We'll pick the best ones and publish a list before he leaves for vacation. Here are the categories: Presidential history: Last year Obama read John Adams by David McCullough. Presidents read about their predecessors for tips about how to do the job but also to put their troubles in perspective. Presidents like Lincoln, Truman, and FDR, now considered great, were also criticized in their time. Ergo, history will prove the current president  right. George Bush made this point a lot. Obama has started to. A president doesn't want to be too literal, though, or the parallels will start to get uncomfortable. With the war in Afghanistan looking so shaky, best to stay away from LBJ biographies. Fiction: All presidents struggle to escape from the constant pressure of their office. Obama feels this acutely and pines for the simple pleasure of a long walk. Taking a vacation only relieves this condition a little. He probably needs something truly transporting. Urban crime drama: Last year Obama read two such books--George Pelecanos's The Way Home and Richard Price's Lush Life--so we figure it's a thing with him. Current events or issues: Last year the president took Tom Friedman's Hot, Flat, and Crowded. At the time it had been on his bedside table for about a year. Given how busy he is, he might still be reading it, but he can't bring it along. It would only highlight that he's not likely to make good on his promise to find the votes for energy reform. The common touch: Pollsters say voters want politicians to connect with their concerns and way of life. One of the symbolic ways presidents do this is by stopping by sandwich shops and burger joints. Is there a literary equivalent? Or, if you consider yourself one of those people whom the president just doesn't understand, you may submit a book from your own reading list. We are no longer accepting submissions. Read the results here. Become a fan of  Slate and  John Dickerson  on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter.

24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/07/taxonomy.html	"When is a tax hike not a hike? When it's a tax un-cut! As Republicans and Democrats clash over whether to extend the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, the battle has become largely rhetorical. The GOP paints the prospect of letting the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans expire--which would reduce spending by an estimated $678 billion--as a hike. ""This is about stopping a job-killing tax hike on small businesses during tough economic times,"" said Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch over the weekend. Democrats, meanwhile, say they're merely proposing a return to home base, a restoration of the world as it was and should be. From their angle, it's the original tax cuts that were abnormal. They're just un-cutting the cut. Tax policy is a lot more complicated than ""cuts"" and ""hikes."" Yet politicians insist on reducing every proposal to one of the two. If the debate over tax policy is going to be accurate, it's probably worth diversifying our terminology. The hike. This is your basic, no-frills tax hike. There are two main methods: You can raise the rate of taxation--for example, President Clinton's 1993 tax hike raised the corporate income tax rate from 34 percent to 35 percent. Or you can increase the amount of money being taxed--so if a tax normally hits people who make up to $100,000, you can then make it hit people who make up to $150,000. Politicians might call that ""expanding revenue"" or some such, but a hike is a hike is a hike. Economists generally prefer broadening the tax base to raising rates, because raising rates incentivizes some people to work less. The cut. Again, two methods: You canlower tax rates, or you can reduce the amount of money that gets taxed. The Bush tax cuts, for example, slashed the top estate tax from 60 percent in 2001 to 45 percent in 2007. They also reduced the total amount of money that's taxable. Most economists urge rate cuts over reductions in the tax base, since it encourages people to work. The break. The break is the cut's younger sister. Instead of explicitly reducing a rate or narrowing the tax base, you carve out a loophole for a particular activity. For example, the Bush tax cuts of 2001 doubled the child tax credit. This served the dual purpose of encouraging an activity--in this case, having children--and putting more money in people's hands. The sunset. Less direct than the hike or the cut--but still often described as such--this means deciding not to extend a tax hike (which opponents can spin as a tax cut) or not to extend a tax cut (which they can spin as a hike). That is, you ""let it sunset."" For example, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, who is running for governor, has proposed allowing a tax hike on the wealthy to expire next year. ""If it doesn't sunset,"" he said, ""it's a tax."" On the flip side, Democrats want to let Bush's tax cuts sunset in 2010, at least for families making more than $250,000. Republicans, of course, portray this as a hike--even though it would merely return us to previous tax levels. That's the thing about most sunsets; they're almost always mirages. Kick the can. Pass a tax hike or cut now that kicks in later. This is a way to say you did something but not to bear the full blame for it once it takes effect. When Democrats needed a way to pay for health care reform, they settled on a tax that doesn't kick in for another eight years. There's an economic rationale for the delay--it gives people time to switch to insurance plans that won't be as heavily taxed. But it's also a political tactic: Delay the pain, delay the blame. The incremental cut/hike. Don't feel like slashing things all at once? Phase the tax policy in, one year at a time. That was the approach to the Bush tax cuts, which did much of their cutting after 2004. By changing the economic landscape gradually rather than suddenly, it becomes harder to repeal the cuts by the time they expire. The derivative cut/hike. If a tax is set to increase over time and you slow its increase, is that a cut? Conversely, if it's decreasing over time--as the Bush tax cuts did--and you slow its decrease, is that a hike? This kind of reversal in the trend of a tax doesn't happen often, but the opposition would no doubt construe as a hike or a cut. The do-nothing hike. Sometimes doing nothing amounts to raising or lowering taxes. Taxes are usually pegged to inflation. But income growth usually outstrips inflation, which means that taxpayers fall into higher tax brackets and thus pay more in taxes. As a result, many taxes end up hitting more people than originally intended--which over time becomes a hike. The patch. When a do-nothing hike looms, Congress usually fixes it with a patch. The most famous patch prevents the Alternative Minimum Tax--which was originally created to affect the wealthy--from impacting too many middle-class Americans. You could therefore describe it as a tax cut, since it reduces the hike. Other, smaller tax tactics abound. Small businesses can expense equipment to take advantage of its depreciation right away instead of over time--which amounts to a tax cut. Same with loopholes that allow businesses to avoid taxes overseas or let them pay taxes later rather than sooner. An expanded taxonomy may not change who supports or opposes the Bush tax cuts. But at least it would add some subtlety to a heretofore two-worded debate. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	A new taxonomy for debating the Bush tax cuts.	['Hatch']	[]
25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/07/let_the_prepreprecampaign_begin.html	"If you're running for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, you're not allowed to admit it. But just because you can't admit it doesn't mean you have to stop campaigning. So when Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota was asked this morning to describe what his party should offer in 2012, he didn't simply say ""me."" Instead he described a bright future that had a Tim Pawlenty-shaped hole in it. ""What do people think when they think about Republicans? What's the stereotype?"" he asked. ""We're all CEOs or sons or daughters of CEOs. We play polo on the weekends. We never got our fingernails dirty. We drink Chablis and eat brie. Uh, that's not my story, and it's not the story for the Tea Party, and it's not the story for most Republicans."" He mentioned the CEO stereotype a few more times, just to make sure that any reporter at the breakfast meeting would get the message. The only way he could have been less subtle is if he had spelled out M-I-T-T R-O-M-N-E-Y with his sausage links. (Romney is the very wealthy founder and former CEO of Bain Capital, a private-equity firm.) Such a display would have offered a segue into Pawlenty's life story, which started in a meatpacking town. He is the youngest of five children, whose mother died when he was 16. Pawlenty, the only one in his family to attend college, was raised by his truck-driver father. Presidential candidates generally try to sell themselves as the opposite of the current occupant. So Pawlenty said the next GOP nominee needed to offer an antidote to Obama's cool detachment. ""When you walk into a VFW and talk to somebody wearing a Carhartt jacket, drinking a Miller High Life beer, you can explain to them your seven-point plan for health care reform,"" he said. ""But what they mostly want to know is: do your values generally line up with theirs, does your life story generally line up with theirs, do you have some life experiences that would indicate that you understand their circumstances, their challenge, and their worries and they connect to you on a heart and a gut level?"" Pawlenty made his gut pitch at his first Christian Science Monitor breakfast. Even in an age when prospective candidates are jockeying on Facebook and Twitter, the breakfast remains a required stop for presidential candidates (particularly for less well-known ones like Pawlenty). The 44-year tradition allows political candidates to test out ideas in front of national political reporters and get wide exposure for their views. It was at a Monitor breakfastin January 1968 that Robert Kennedy first hinted that he might run for president. In 1991, Bill Clinton hinted at the rumors in his personal life--with his wife also at the breakfast (the idea was to inoculate himself against future disclosures). Pawlenty had several messages to send. He arrived fresh from his most recent trip to Afghanistan and Iraq. He pointed out that he'd been to Iraq five times and Afghanistan three times. For a candidate without extensive foreign policy experience, it is important to show that you can talk about national security issues. He spoke with knowledge but no particular insight on the two wars. He opposes Obama's July 2011 deadline for starting to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, saying it is having a corrosive effect on our efforts to get Afghan leaders and the Pakistanis to cooperate. He says none of the military officials he talked to expressed this opinion, though. Pawlenty is in the position Barack Obama was in when he was a candidate. Perhaps it's the trap all candidates are in. They take trips predicated on gathering facts and seeing things up close, but the trips only serve to confirm their existing positions. Pawlenty's is the conventional Republican view, which means he and his party are on track to use Afghanistan as an issue in 2012 against Obama--just as he used it as an issue against George Bush (and John McCain) in 2008. Pawlenty is wise to make distinctions on tone, because, as he pointed out, ""in the end, there's going to be five, 10, 12 candidates standing on the stage who, at least for now, all look kind of the same. And they're going to say about the same thing. There'll be general agreement as to the content of the message."" He's right.   His views are largely indistinguishable from those of his likely opponents. He opposes tax increases to shrink the deficit (""I don't think the argument can be credibly made that the United States of America is undertaxed"") and supports Arizona's immigration law (""It has been wildly, irresponsibly mischaracterized by people quoted in the press including the president of the United States""). *  One area of potential separation from potential rivals is on the TARP, which Romney  and Palin  supported but which Pawlenty opposed (""I think some creative destruction of some of the misbehavior as it relates to Wall Street firms and investment banks would have been a healthy signal to send."") Of all of his potential rivals, Pawlenty mentioned only Sarah Palin by name. He pointed out that she might not have to get into the race until later because she's so well-known. That means she doesn't have to spend time introducing herself to people and can raise money quickly. This may be wise analysis, or it may be a trap, if the conventional wisdom is true and voters in early primary states penalize candidates who don't work hard for their vote. A late entrant can be accused of taking the voters for granted. That's another reason, of course, to attend these Monitor breakfasts: to show reporters that you don't take them for granted.

26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/07/friends_without_benefits.html	"Senate Democrats finally broke a Republican filibuster Wednesday on a $34 billion package that would allow the unemployed to collect benefits for up to 99 weeks. The bill passed in a final vote--but only after Republicans made Democrats wait an extra 30 hours after cloture, a formality that parties usually waive. Why are Republicans so determined to stop the benefits--even for 30 hours? It's not about the polls. Extending unemployment benefits is a popular move.  A recent poll conducted by CBS News found that 52 percent of respondents favored extending benefits even if it meant enlarging the federal deficit, with 39 percent opposed. * The numbers were even more skewed in a poll by ABC News that provided the arguments for and against the measure, with 62 percent for and 36 percent against. It's not about November--at least, not entirely. (More on that later.) Republicans say they oppose the extension because it adds to the deficit. But the deficit isn't anywhere near Americans' top priority. In a recent Gallup poll, the national debt ranked sixth among the most important problems facing the country, behind the oil spill and health care. Unemployment and jobs ranked second. Extending unemployment benefits wouldn't create jobs directly, but it would put money into the hands of people who would spend it, stimulating the economy. It's not about principle, either. Congress has extended unemployment benefits five times since the beginning of 2008, including under President Bush. During past recessions--2003, 1992, 1983--Congress extended benefits, albeit not nearly as long as the new 99-week cap. The difference this time, Republicans say, is that the extension isn't paid for. (In reality, it's a mixed bag: Some past extensions have been paid for; some haven't.) ""I don't know anybody who's not in favor of extending unemployment,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday. He just wants it to be paid for--for example, by dipping into unspent stimulus funds.  Democrats point out, however, that Republicans have not applied this pay-as-you-go standard to their own policies, particularly the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, which added to the debt by a lot more than $34 billion. * Some Republicans also argue that extending unemployment benefits will make people less likely to look for jobs. But when there are five job seekers for every available job, that's a hard argument to support. What it's probably about, unsurprisingly, is political branding: The GOP wants to reassert itself as the party of fiscal responsibility. That image has taken a blow in the last decade. The Bush tax cuts only added to the deficit, as did the Medicare prescription drug benefit and the war in Iraq. Worse, Obama appears to be claiming the deficit-hawk mantle as his own. Health care reform, Democrats are only too eager to point out, will cut the deficit by $138 billion over the first decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Meanwhile, Obama has set up a bipartisan debt commission to tackle the painful spending choices that await us. Sure, the solution will be dubbed ""bipartisan."" But Democrats will make sure no one forgets that their guy started it. Republicans therefore need a rock on which to plant their flag--and unemployment benefits appears to be it. Never mind that $34 billion is a pittance compared with the size of the deficit ($1.5 trillion) or the debt ($13 trillion). Or that economists largely agree that stimulating our way out of the recession is more important--for now--than cutting the deficit. Opposing the benefits package lets Republicans say they tried to rein in yet another piece of outrageous Democratic spending. And that, per the caveat above, does help in November. Voters may favor extending benefits, but they're also ticked off about the bad economy, and most think Obama's stimulus package hurt. Never mind that the desire to extend benefits and rein in spending contradict each other--cognitive dissonance among voters is nothing new. Republicans are betting that frustration with Obama wins out. And given that voters usually blame the incumbent for an ailing economy, they're probably right. But they're also playing the long game. Whoever controls the House after November, cutting the deficit will necessarily occupy Congress for a generation. Positioning yourself as the party of fiscal responsibility makes sense in the long run--even if it means a few million Americans remain jobless in the short run. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter.

27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/07/skim_baby_skim.html	"Plug one leak, and another springs up. That's the lesson the Obama administration is learning after BP successfully capped the oil well that has leaked into the Gulf of Mexico for nearly three months. But now it's not oil that's escaping. It's gas. As November approaches, Republicans are emitting kilotons of hot air over Obama's handling of the clean-up. ""This is mainly a failure of the administration,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Sunday. ""BP caused the spill. It's BP's responsibility to plug that leak."" But, McConnell said, the federal government has been slow to mop it up. On Fox News, Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana accused Obama of ignoring the spill for political reasons: ""I'm afraid he's decided to deal with this issue, at least politically, by not coming back here at all, and trying to move it off the front page rather than dealing with the situation forcefully."" Entertain for a moment the possibility that these Republican criticisms are not mere politics but fair-minded critiques of the administration. What, exactly, would Republicans have done differently, were they the ones in charge? The biggest difference, based on their public statements, is that they would have mobilized more oil-collecting skimmers sooner. ""It took the administration 70 days to order skimmers down to the Gulf,"" McConnell said on Sunday. Sen. George LeMieux of Florida, the leader of the Skim, Baby, Skim caucus, has been equally frustrated. ""We need every resource, domestic and foreign alike, in the Gulf, and we needed them yesterday,"" he said on the Senate floor June 30. ""In fact, we needed them 50 days ago."" At the beginning of June, there were still only about 100 skimmers in the Gulf. (There are an estimated 1,600 skimmers available off the coast of the continental United States.) It wasn't until late June that the Coast Guard and the Environmental Protection Agency issued an order freeing up additional skimmers from other parts of the country to deploy to the Gulf Coast. If Obama were serious about the clean-up, Republicans say, he or Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen would have demanded more skimmers sooner. Then again, a Republican president would have faced the same complications that Obama did. According to the Deepwater Horizon Joint Information Center, the number of skimmers in the Gulf increased by 450, to 550 total, in the month of June, before Allen relaxed the rules that would allow more skimmers. Since then, the number has increased by only 150 more. So the newly relaxed rules haven't made a huge difference so far. Plus, skimmers are just one element of the clean-up. Crews are also using chemical dispersants and controlled burns to get rid of oil. And in many cases, those methods are more effective than skimming, which collects mostly water. The nature of the spill has changed, too. When the leak began, the oil spill was a large, thick, monolithic blob, requiring fewer, larger skimmers. Later, after it was broken up by dispersants into smaller, isolated blotches, many smaller skimmers could collect it more effectively. Another major plank of a GOP president's clean-up effort would presumably be to waive the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, better known as the Jones Act, which prohibits foreign vessels from making deliveries between American ports. President Bush waived the law in 2005 to allow foreign assistance in New Orleans. Republicans argue that Obama's refusal to waive it has prevented foreign countries from donating vessels and other equipment to help clean up the spill. ""There are thousands of ships around the world"" that would help, if only Obama would let them, LeMieux told Fox News. Not quite, says the Department of Homeland Security. Foreign-flagged vessels have been helping out with the clean-up since the very beginning, and in mid-June, the number was up to 15. It's true that the State Department has been slow to accept some offers of foreign assistance: At the end of June, about 80 percent of the international offers made were still ""under consideration,"" according to a State Department count. But the number has since improved, with 66 percent of government offers accepted, according to a different tally by the National Incident Command. More importantly, the Jones Act is irrelevant to such offers. For one thing, the Jones Act already excepts vessels dedicated to cleaning up oil spills, so it would never keep a foreign skimmer away. Plus, the Jones Act applies only within three miles of shore. When it comes to collecting oil near the Deepwater Horizon rig 50 miles off the Louisiana coast, the Jones Act has no sway. In only two cases has the administration needed to waive the Jones Act after the BP spill, and that was to make sure two foreign vessels could return to the coast in the event of a hurricane. ""In no case has any offer of assistance been declined because of the Jones Act or similar laws,"" says the Department of Homeland Security. Rather, the United States has turned down assistance because, for example, the dispersants being offered aren't approved, or the skimmers don't skim properly. Another difference between Obama and a hypothetical GOP president: The Republican would have taken a stronger leadership role, rather than delegating to BP. ""Instead of acting like BP's assistant in this effort, the administration should act as an overseer,"" says Rep. Cliff Stearns of Florida. He would also have tried harder to stop the spill. ""The president should have brought in the best minds and experts from industry, from academia, and from governments around the world to develop an effective response,"" says Stearns. Instead of James Cameron, perhaps Michael Bay. A Republican president would also have visited the Gulf Coast a lot more than Obama. Although Obama has swung through the Gulf four times since the initial explosion on April 20 and is planning a fifth trip, some Republicans say that's not enough. They want on-the-ground, Rudy Giuliani-style leadership. ""I do not want to see him in Wisconsin giving a political speech,"" said LeMieux. ""I want to see him in Florida getting these skimmers there, overcoming obstacles, solving problems, managing through this crisis, so we can protect our beaches, protect our estuaries, and protect the way of life for the people of Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana."" How much time focusing on the spill is enough? LeMieux said that during the 2005 hurricane seasons he watched Jeb Bush dedicate ""12, 14, 16 hours a day to make things happen, to get results."" Indeed, Obama's fifth visit may fix everything. A Republican president would also treat BP and other oil companies better. He wouldn't be kind, of course (or apologize)--any president would have publicly shamed BP. But he probably wouldn't use the spill as an excuse to crack down on all oil companies, safety conscious or not. Likewise, a Republican president would face less internal pressure to force BP to create a $20 billion escrow fund. And he would almost certainly not announce a moratorium on deep-sea oil drilling--especially after a federal judge slapped it down as unconstitutional. Vitter, along with Sens. John Cornyn of Texas and Roger Wicker of Mississippi, is currently sponsoring a bill that would overturn the moratorium. Vitter estimates that the moratorium will kill 140,000 jobs. From their perspective, the damage to the economy caused by the moratorium outweighs the risk of another accident. Lastly, a Republican president wouldn't leverage the spill to sell America on the importance of alternative energies and pass comprehensive energy reform. But then again, a Democrat might not, either. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	How would a Republican president have handled the Gulf oil spill?

28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/07/the_twitter_primary.html	"The next Republican presidential campaign will happen in lots of new places. There will be all the familiar locations we love so much--Iowa, New Hampshire, diners, and Lincoln Day dinners--but this week offered another reminder, as if we needed one, that the race for the 2012 nomination will play out in the virtual world and at hyperspeed. For the next 18 months, there will be stories and controversies and entire news cycles (or mini-cycles) in which the candidates deliver their messages but in which no one is actually seen speaking. The most successful adopter is Sarah Palin on Facebook. She's been posting messages on the social network for months. This week she endorsed Karen Handel in the Republican primary in Georgia, which drew a sharp response from one of Handel's GOP challengers, and responded to the NAACP resolution calling on the Tea Party to denounce racism. ""The charge that Tea Party Americans judge people by the color of their skin is false, appalling,"" she wrote, ""and is a regressive and diversionary tactic to change the subject at hand."" In politics, the general rule used to be that, to get yourself involved in a story, you had to haul yourself in front of a camera. Not so much anymore. Palin's post was mentioned in nearly every story about the resolution, including on the network news. (It helped that this was a fight producers couldn't resist, and that Palin attracts a big audience.) Then Newt Gingrich, who announced this week that he's seriously considering running for president, inserted himself into the story in the role of peacemaker and wise man. He suggested on Twitter that the NAACP and Tea Party could come together. ""The naacp has opened up a wonderful opportunity for the tea party movement. Local tea party leaders across america should reach out. ... If tea party leaders contact local naacp chapters and offer to cohost local townhalll meetings a wonderful dialogue could begin."" Gingrich loses points for verbosity--his message took two tweets--but he wins them back with liberal use of lowercase and misspellings. On Friday, Mark Halperin published a column in Time that quoted an anonymous Romney adviser knocking Palin as not serious. The story was burning through the political Twitter world until @MittRomney tweeted: ""TIME says unnamed advisors disparaged @SarahPalinUSA. Anonymous numbskulls. She's proven her smarts; they've disproven theirs."" Smart move, Governor. It's too early to get into an anonymous battle with Palin. As an adviser to another 2012 Republican hopeful put it when presented with an opportunity to bash another member of the party, ""We're in the business of making friends."" There's no upside in knocking Palin, who may not run for president but will certainly be in a position to influence a lot of voters. Romney also wins stylistic points for use of the word ""numbskull,"" an awfully voicey choice for a candidate who can seem wooden. In the end, all of this jockeying may have the same marginal affect on the race that road sign jockeying does. But it's clear that the candidates are taking it seriously as a way to get around the traditional media or present themselves in ways that the traditional media pick up quickly. The downside to all of this lightning quick, context-free communication seems easier to see.   Gingrich proved it when he fired off a blast about Sonia Sotomayor being a racist several months ago. * He had to retreat from his remarks, but if he ends up running as a national candidate in states with a Hispanic electorate, he'll probably be asked about that tweet again by the press and his opponents. There will also come a time when candidates like Romney don't want to knock down the anonymous quotes in the press. All candidates find it useful to have messages conveyed anonymously without having to own up to them. When this happens, and reporters ask questions, reporters are told the candidate is too busy to sit for an interview and simply can't answer every claim made by an anonymous source. But now with such a low bar--who doesn't have time for a 140-character response?--it will be harder for candidates to hide. These new venues aren't replacements for the old ways. Someone like Mitt Romney still needs to publish columns on the op-ed page of the Washington Post, where it will be read by people who still think Twitter is something birds do in the morning. It just means there are new ways for candidates to compete and push their message--and new ways to measure candidates against one another. Almost nothing matters more than money raised in politics, and as the second quarter comes to a close, the totals are being closely watched. But here's another list: the Twitter accounts of potential 2012 hopefuls: Newt Gingrich: 1,308,757  followers, 1,925 tweetsSarah Palin: 191,164  followers, 347 tweetsMike Huckabee: 83,297  followers, 1,188 tweetsTim Pawlenty: 16,464  followers, 235 tweetsMitt Romney: 14,347  followers, 241 tweetsHaley Barbour: 6,357  followers, 264 tweetsMitch Daniels: 3,451  followers, 457 tweets Haley  Barbour is such an outlier that Twitter hasn't even bothered to verify his account *, the way it does with celebrities and politicians.

29	29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/07/pelosis_paradox.html	"In the debate over how to reduce the deficit--should we cut spending or raise taxes? should we do it now or later?--economists say we should spend now and save later. This is partly Economics 101: We're still in a recession, so let's stimulate our way out of it before turning to fiscal austerity. But it's also a convenient way to put off hard choices. Regardless of whoever pays the economic price for deficit reduction, the consensus seems to be that future Congresses should pay the political price. Indeed, many of the biggest pieces of legislation facing Congress put off political pain.  For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act--otherwise known as health care reform--pays for itself with an excise tax on ""Cadillac"" insurance plans that  doesn't kick in  until 2018. *  Financial regulatory reform would put a consumer financial protection agency in place right away, but the panel wouldn't reach full strength until 2020. Immigration reform, meanwhile, would require illegal immigrants to wait another eight years before they could apply for permanent residency. In other words, each bill contains provisions that will be implemented sometime in the future--not by Congress, necessarily, but by the executive branch. But these policies will require enough continued congressional support that no future Congress tries to reverse them. And there's no guarantee they wouldn't. The problem is partly legal, partly political. Courts have long held that Congress cannot ""bind"" future Congresses--that is, it can't force a future session of Congress to carry on its own policies. That practice, formally known as ""legislative entrenchment,"" is seen as privileging one group of lawmakers over another, ""binding"" future to the priorities set in the present. In the 1996 case U.S. v. Winstar Corp., Justice David Souter quoted the British jurist William Blackstone, who said that ""the legislature, being in truth the sovereign power, is always of equal, always of absolute authority: it acknowledges no superior upon earth, which the prior legislature must have been, if it's [sic] ordinances could bind the present parliament."" The principle is more complicated in the United States, where the government is bound by the Constitution and any private contracts into which it enters. But as a general rule, any Congress can reverse the decisions of any past Congress. For example, Bob Dole repealed future tax cuts in the 1980s. Our political system makes promise-keeping even harder. Congress always has the incentive to act in its own short-term interest at the expense of the country's long-term interest, since spending is more likely to get you re-elected than saving. The result is that Congress always puts off hard financial decisions. That's how we end up with policies like the annual ""doc fix,"" which adjusts the Medicare reimbursement schedule to keep payments high, or the annual ""AMT patch,"" which fiddles with the tax brackets so the middle class can avoid the Alternative Minimum Tax. There are plenty of ideas for how to solve the binding problem. But, so far, none has worked. Obama's debt commission, for example, is trying to break the cycle of never-ending red ink. If both parties commit to the commission's goals, the theory goes, they'll give each other political cover to keep their promises in the future. But say everything goes according to plan.  The commission drafts a blueprint to reduce the debt * to 69 percent of GDP by 2020. (The debt is currently on track to reach 100 percent of GDP by 2022.) Congress begins whittling away at entitlement spending while sucking up the pain of major tax hikes. Even then, Congress still faces the conundrum of how to make sure that future Congresses stay on the path. The strongest way for one Congress to bind another is by adopting a constitutional amendment. When it comes to reducing the deficit, for example, Congresses have tried to pass a balanced budget amendment. The first attempt was in 1936. Congress tried again in 1947, 1956, a couple of times in the 1980s, and twice during the 1990s. But passing any amendment requires two-thirds majority in both houses, plus ratification by three-quarters of the states. None of the budget-balancing efforts have cleared the bar. And even if they did, a future Congress could always repeal the amendment if there were enough political will. (Of course, a two-thirds majority is hard to get, making constitutional amendmentsas good as binding.) But say Congress did pass a balanced-budget amendment. The federal government would still find loopholes that allow it to run a deficit. Just look at the states. Many states currently require that all spending be paid for. But they've found all kinds of workarounds, such as creating a separate entity to borrow money on behalf of the state that doesn't show up in the annual budget. Even the balanced budget amendments proposed in 1990s included loopholes. Under one, for example, Congress could engage in deficit spending if the country were in a recession and three-fifths of Congress voted to override the amendment. Then again, maybe it's a good thing Congress can't control its future self. Any Congress forced to carry out the desires of a previous Congress has less flexibility to respond to crises. For example, requiring a balanced budget could have all kinds of adverse consequences. It could push the economy even further into recession. It would risk political deadlock if Congress can't reach an agreement. And it could make it harder for a Congress to make its own decisions about what's best for the country, since it privileges balancing the budget over all other issues. Then again, if you think about it, Congress binds itself all the time. As University of Chicago law professor Eric Posner points out: ""Congress can already bind the future in uncontroversial ways. It borrows money, compelling the future to repay or suffer a loss of credit. It starts wars, compelling the future to finish them. Everything Congress does affects future generations, for good or for ill."" You might not be able to physically force a future Congress to cut costs. But you can pass laws and create political pressure to make it hard for them to wriggle out of something. In 2001, for example, Congress passed tax cuts with the explicit understanding that they would expire in 2010--that's what the law said. But there was an implicit understanding that it would be pretty hard for the Congress of 2010 to allow them to expire. Ultimately, the only way to ensure that a future Congress follows orders--whether it's to eliminate the deficit or to punish banks or to implement immigration reform--is the old-fashioned way: Political pressure. Whether that pressure comes from K Street lobbyists or grass-roots campaigns, its purpose is to persuade Congress that this cause still matters. Deficit reduction will only happen if future Congresses are as scared of the issue as the present Congress. (The reasoning could go something like this: I don't like these tax hikes, either, but we need to do something about the deficit, and, besides, I didn't write this law.) Congress may not be able to bind itself, but politics can. Correction,  July 15, 2010: This article incorrectly stated that the ""Cadillac"" tax doesn't kick in until 2013. (Return to the corrected sentence.) Correction,  July 15, 2010: This article stated that the presidential debt commission seeks to reduce the deficit to 69 percent of GDP by 2020.
