Jim DeMint, R-S.C., probably the only Tea Party incumbent  on Election Day, was re-elected by a comfortable margin of 61 percent to 28 percent. With little need to worry about his own prospects, he concentrated on writing a Wall Street Journal op-ed (""Welcome, Senate Conservatives"") advising freshman tea partiers on how to navigate the moral cesspool atop Capitol Hill (where he has labored for more than a decade, first in the House and, since 2005, in the Senate). Most of DeMint's advice is benign and predictable (don't get co-opted by lobbyists; don't request earmarks; hire likeminded staff; don't value re-election above all else). Some of it is a dig at Republican leaders like Mitch McConnell (""don't seek titles""). But one recommendation on his list struck me as novel: Avoid committee assignments. ""[B]eware of committees,"" DeMint wrote. ""Committee assignments can be used as bait to make senators compromise on other matters. Rookie senators are often told they must be a member of a particular committee to advance a certain piece of legislation. This may be true in the House, but a senator can legislate on any matter from the Senate floor."" What's new isn't DeMint's suggestion that committee membership matters more in the House (which has 335 more members and keeps a tighter rein on floor action) than in the Senate. Rather, it's DeMint's conclusion that because committee membership matters somewhat less in the Senate, it should be avoided altogether. This is a new, bracingly nihilistic notion about what it means to be a U.S. senator. ""I never heard the avoid-committee advice before,"" the Brookings Institution's Thomas Mann, who's forgotten more about the U.S. Congress than I'll ever know, informed me by e-mail. ""Committees are less important in the Senate than in the House,"" Mann agreed, ""but still essential for getting into the guts of legislation and learning something about the substance of programs and their implementation."" ""Perhaps,"" Mann mused, DeMint ""is afraid that his new minions will go native on committees and dilute their role in the revolutionary vanguard."" Action equals corruption. Mere knowledge equals corruption. Ignorance is strength. DeMint (whose office ignored my request that he elaborate) would probably dispute this interpretation. After all, ""a senator can legislate on any matter from the Senate floor""! But that's a ridiculous exaggeration. Legislating from the floor typically means introducing either an amendment or a filibuster. Amendments, Mann notes, ""aren't really a satisfactory alternative"" to crafting a bill and seeing it through the committee process, ""especially given the filibuster-induced paralysis in the Senate chamber."" Not unless--could it be?--paralysis through filibuster or the sponsorship of mischievous killer amendments is the whole idea. DeMint wrote his op-ed before the election results were in and probably assumed (somewhat disloyally, it seems to me) that the Democrats would maintain their Senate majority, which they did. He therefore assumed it would remain necessary for any self-respecting Republican to emulate Professor Quincy Adams Wagstaff, who  sings in the Marx Brothers'  Horse Feathers, ""Whatever It Is, I'm Against It."" Does DeMint actually mean what he's saying, or is he simply posturing, trying to establish himself as more contemptuous of bipartisanship than any other member? Well, let's take a look at his own committee memberships. He's on the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee; the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee; the Foreign Relations Committee (perhaps the clubbiest in the entire U.S. Senate); and the Joint Economic Committee. That's four. I asked Mann: Is four a lot, or a little?  ""The mean number of standing committee assignments in the Senate is 3.4,"" Mann explained. In other words, DeMint sits on slightly more committees than the average senator. If you count subcommittees, Mann added, the mean number of committee assignments is 11.7. DeMint sits on 10 subcommittees--on three of them he's the ranking member; that is, the Republican most likely to consort with the Democratic enemy--bringing his total up to 14. That's more than two committees above the average! We must conclude that either DeMint hates himself for being unable to overcome a debilitating committee-sitting addiction or he's a hypocrite offering advice that he would never be foolish enough to follow himself.

In the second year of his term, the voters give him a colonic. Or, as President Obama put it at his news conference Wednesday, ""a shellacking."" In the post-election press conference that has now become a White House tradition, Obama's goal was to show that he ""got it."" This was the big charge of the campaign, lobbed liberally by both sides. But the election results shifted the burden on the president. Republicans didn't just take over the House and win six seats in the Senate. They picked up a slew of governor's offices and flipped 19 statehouses from Democratic to Republican. There is a formula for these press conferences after the president's party suffers a big electoral defeat. Bill Clinton in 1994, George W. Bush in 2006, and Obama today all acknowledged that voters wanted an end to partisan bickering and called for a new era of cooperation. This may be true, but it's not the point. All took responsibility for the slow pace of ""progress""--a word each put into heavy rotation--but went no further. All refused to admit that the election said anything about their course for the country. This is all a game of peek-a-boo, because all of the presidents ultimately admit that underneath they know the defeat was much more severe than their careful half-admissions suggest. ""I think [the voters] were saying two things to me,"" Clinton said at his press conference ""or maybe three. They were saying--maybe 300."" He obviously understood the magnitude. George Bush referred to the 2006 Democratic control as a ""thumping."" Those kinds of descriptions are candid and invite more candor. Like Clinton, Obama flirted with frankness. He admitted he had not changed the legislative process as he'd promised. He also said he'd been reflecting about how to handle issues related to businesses and investment. But on the main issue he gave no ground: Obama flat-out rejected that his policies were taking the country in the wrong direction. (In post-election exit polls, 52 percent of voters said Obama's policies were harming the country.) Bush, by contrast, took action in 2006. At his post-Election Day news conference, he announced that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was stepping down. The voters didn't force him to do it, but by making the move after the election, Bush showed that he'd gotten the message. Maybe the difference between a first-term president and one in his second is how closely tied the election and the message are. In his first term, Bush contemplated dropping Vice President Dick Cheney to send a similar message but decided against it. No president is going to admit that he's been on the wrong path, particularly when his opponent says what John Boehner did: ""The American people have sent an unmistakable message to him tonight, and that message is, 'Change course.' "" But eventually a president can get around to responding to the core protest of an election. Sometimes he allows some time to pass, to make it look like the actions are somewhat disconnected. Clinton, for example, fired no one the day after the election. But he slowly began a program of moving to the middle so that by January 1996 he could declare ""the era of big government is over."" That was the ultimate signal that he had heard the voters who thought he was too liberal and had moved too fast. President Obama seemed to be trying to send a similar kind of signal, though it was hard to pick up. He made it clear that the crisis-driven haste of the first part of his term was over. He promised to work with Republicans on energy legislation, education, and reducing earmarks. Where there were disagreements, he said he would go small: ""It's doubtful that you could get the votes to pass [cap-and-trade energy legislation] through the House this year or next year or the year after. But that doesn't mean there isn't agreement that we should have a better energy policy. And so let's find those areas where we can agree."" Obama also tried to do a little rewriting of history, saying that because his administration had to respond to crises by, for example, passing an economic stimulus package and bailing out automakers, people thought he was engaged in a systematic expansion of government. ""It was an emergency situation,"" he said. ""But I think it's understandable that folks said to themselves, 'You know, maybe this is the agenda as opposed to a response to an emergency.' "" That wasn't the spirit of the early Obama administration. ""Never let a crisis go to waste"" was former Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel's saying. He believed that success bred success and that the administration shouldn't risk slowing the pace. The health care bill was an elective policy proposal promoted in this crisis-as-opportunity strategy. The president is feeling out the new situation. He was cautious in response to an electorate that was not. He seemed to struggle in the press conference, as he has throughout his presidency, with those parts of his job that call on him to convey to people that he understands what they're going through. ""You know, there is an inherent danger in being in the White House and being in the bubble,"" he said. ""One of the challenges that we've got to think about is--is how do I meet my responsibilities here in the White House, which require a lot of--a lot of hours and a lot of work, but still have that opportunity to engage with the American people on a--on a day-to-day basis and know--give them confidence that I'm listening to them?"" He doesn't necessarily have to travel to send that message. One place he could have started was at Wednesday's press conference.

2	2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/party_of_the_right.html	"""I'm a Cleveland Browns fan. I've never won anything,"" says Adam Brandon. It's 1 a.m. Wednesday *, and Brandon, communications director for the conservative group FreedomWorks, is standing in the lobby of the organization's office on Pennsylvania Avenue. Every surface--tables, shelves, floor--is covered with confetti. The two kegs are kicked. Rows of computers are littered with half-eaten burritos and pizza crusts. This is what victory looks like. ""I've never felt this,"" he says. ""It's euphoric!"" It's also deserved. Over the last two years, no group has been more involved in recruiting, funding, and publicizing Tea Party candidates than FreedomWorks. Whether or not you buy its ""grassroots"" rhetoric--it was founded by former Republican Majority Leader Dick Armey--the group can take at least some credit for Tuesday's Republican sweep. Brandon lifts a giant wine glass. ""After 2008, everyone was saying Charlie Crist was the future of the Republican Party,"" he says. ""The day we endorsed Rubio, it was, Rubio couldn't possibly win."" This election confirms once and for all that America is ""a center-right country,"" he says. Now the Tea Party enters a new phase. ""The Tea Party is done with street protests,"" he says. ""We're done, that's it. Now we've got Congress."" Now comes the policymaking. For those who say the Tea Party has no legislative ideas, Brandon has three words: ""Here it comes."" Matt Kibbe, the president of FreedomWorks, comes over wearing a pinstriped suit jacket and jeans. ""This is the most awesome party,"" he says. Brandon agrees: ""You'll find this party is more exciting than the Republicans'. Our activists are fired up."" (Indeed, the GOP victory party was deliberately low-key.) Someone made a bunch of T-shirts featuring a cartoon of Kibbe's face, mutton chops and all, with the words, ""Chops You Can Believe In."" A cheer goes up in the next room. The results of the Illinois Senate race are in: Republican Mark Kirk has won. FreedomWorks isn't afraid to take credit for many of the night's victories. Of the 113 candidates FreedomWorks endorsed, the number who have won their races as of 1 a.m. is 62 and climbing. For the last two years, FreedomWorks has boosted Tea Party candidates. Now it's their job to hold those candidates to their promises. ""We've got them on the record now,"" says Brandon. ""If you got elected on the Contract from America, we expect"" you to support fiscally conservative policies. Tea Party candidates may be tempted to moderate, Pappas says. But he doesn't think they will--at least not if they want to survive. FreedomWorks will remind the new class why they got elected in the first place, and will encourage constituents to do the same. The 1994 Gingrich ""revolution"" fizzled out. But 2010 isn't 1994, says Pappas: In 1994, there was no outside group like the Tea Party holding politicians accountable. ""The first test is earmarks,"" says Kibbe. He expects Republicans to be about half ""appropriators,"" half anti-pork. FreedomWorks will be supporting the latter. ""It's not like eliminating earmarks fixes everything,"" says Kibbe, ""but it changes the culture."" Max Pappas, VP for public policy, says an early goal will be to make Congress extend the Bush tax cuts--or, as he puts it, ""prevent the Obama tax hikes."" Russ Walker, political director, points to a few districts that the Tea Party can take special credit for. There were two Republican pickups in Colorado by Scott Tipton, Col.-3, and Cary Gardner, Col.-4, where FreedomWorks was active, for example. They also endorsed senators-elect Marco Rubio, Pat Toomey, and Ron Johnson back when it was unfashionable, Walker says. There were disappointments. Walker thinks Harry Reid's seat was a missed opportunity. ""It's like you got to the Super Bowl but you didn't get the ring,"" he says. What could Sharron Angle have done better? ""I'd rather not talk about it,"" he says, although he does argue that she erred by avoiding the media. ""You should be able to defend your positions,"" he says. Around 2 a.m., Brandon decides to call it a night. He has to be up at 6 a.m. to help coordinate Armey's media appearances. Someone offers their condolences. ""No, this is awesome!"" he says, pounding the table. ""I've been waiting for this for two fucking years!"" They'll worry about the mess in the morning. Correction,  Nov. 3: This article originally described a scene as taking place ""Tuesday night."" It should have been Wednesday morning. (Return to the corrected sentence.) Like Slate on  Facebook.

3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/blue_linings.html	"Rep. Chris Van Hollen's job was tough enough already. As chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, he was responsible for coordinating House races across the country during an inevitably bad election year. At about 9 p.m. Tuesday, his job got worse. At DNC headquarters on Capitol Hill, Van Hollen came downstairs to speak with a gaggle of reporters. His message was one of cautious optimism: ""People understood the high stakes in this election, and we remain confident we're going to have a strong showing and keep the majority."" After a brief back-and-forth, MSNBC's Norah O'Donnell cut in: ""Congressman, we just called the House for the Republicans."" A pained smile. ""Well, I think that's a mistake,"" he said. Ten minutes later, all three networks made the same call. Tuesday night tested the Democratic spin machine like never before. Even as the losses piled up, party officials stuck to their message: That the American people don't want to go back to the same old Republican policies. How do massive Democratic losses in the House somehow add up to a rejection of Republicans? As DNC Chairman Tim Kaine explained, a GOP takeover of the House may be ""a message from the American public."" But it's not a rebuke of Democratic policies, he suggested. It's a message about the need for bipartisan cooperation--that ""everybody's gotta work together."" A vote for Republicans is thus a vote against Republican obstructionism. Or something. Democrats also argued that the losses aren't as bad as they were expecting. One strategist pointed to the victories of Reps. Heath Shuler in North Carolina, John Carney in Delaware, and Joe Donnelly in Indiana, the last of whom voted for health care reform, as evidence that calamity has been avoided. Dems also kept an eye out for cruel twists of fate, such as Republicans' loss of the Delaware House district Republican Rep. Mike Castle vacated in order to run for a Senate seat the Republicans also lost. Another bright spot: Democrats may be losing governorships north and south, but they appear to be holding onto key seats like Massachusetts and Maryland. And compared with 2006, they say, Democratic turnout is way up. Of course, that's to be expected after the wave of new Democratic voters in 2008. Of all the silver linings, perhaps the shiniest is that they'll hold onto the Senate. Few people ever seriously suggested they would lose the Senate. (Many asked the question.) But it's a relief nonetheless. Relentless optimism can lead to cognitive dissonance. On the one hand, Democrats emphasized that they got the message. On the other, they seemed unclear on what the message was. ""We're going to be listening closely,"" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told a packed room at the Liaison Hotel earlier in the evening. ""And we're gonna be expecting the American people to say we want to move this country forward."" In other words: We're listening. But we know what we're going to hear. Democrats wanted Americans to listen to them, too. The core message of Nancy Pelosi's early evening address: It's not too late to vote! ""Across the country, the polls are still open,"" she said. The fact that media organizations began calling the House for Republicans before all polls had closed irked Democrats. But in the world of spin, asking the media not to report the news might be one rotation too far. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	The Democratic spin machine goes into overdrive.

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/election_night_cheat_sheet.html	"Get your last bits of election speculation and guessing out now--because starting Tuesday night we will have actual facts. People will vote. Candidates will win. Careers will end. Power in Washington will shift. There are 435 elections in the House, 37 in the Senate, and 37 gubernatorial elections. To help you sift through the returns, here's a reader and viewer's guide to some key things to watch. Where we standThe official unemployment rate is 9.6 percent, though the true picture may be closer to 17 percent. In states with key races, the unemployment rate is worse: In Nevada it's 14.4 percent; in Ohio it's 10 percent. President Obama's approval rating is about 45 percent. The generic ballot shows voters picking Republicans over Democrats by seven points. The congressional approval rating is below 20 percent. Almost $4 billion has been spent  on the election. House contests to watch There are nearly 100 contested House races to watch. (Follow them all on the spreadsheet I created that tracks votes, the partisan makeup of their district, and Tea Party support.) All but five represent possible Republican pickup opportunities. Each one is interesting, and those of you who want to talk through all of them can stay after class. Here, though, are a few pairs of races to watch to get a sense of whether this will be a big night for the GOP or a gargantuan night. Indiana's 2nd and 9th districts. Indiana polls close at 6 p.m. ET. It's a pundit's first shot at fact-based speculation.  Democrat Baron Hill represents Indiana's 9th District, which is one of the 48 John McCain won in 2008. * It is a Republican district that Hill represented and then lost and then won again in the Democratic wave of 2006. This is the kind of place Republicans should win. The 2nd District is a little harder. Obama won that district, represented by Democrat Joe Donnelly, with 54 percent of the vote, and it is less Republican. (Indiana election returns)Georgia's 2nd and 8th districts. The South is not Democratic territory. The 8th, represented by Democrat Jim Marshall, is heavily Republican. Obama got only 43 percent of the vote there in 2008. If it's a very big night, Democrat Sanford Bishop will lose in the 2nd District. That district leans Democratic, and Obama won there with 54 percent of the vote. Almost 50 percent of the district is African-American, a key part of the Democratic base that needs to turn out for Democrats everywhere. (Georgia election results)Virginia's 11th and 5th districts. Democrat Gerald Connolly represents the wealthiest district in the United States, Virginia's 11th, which is perhaps why he supports the extension of the Bush tax cuts for those making more than $250,000. Obama carried it in 2008 with 57 percent of the vote. It is a quintessential suburban district. The 5th is one that Republicans have been planning to win. It's a McCain district, and Democrat Tom Perriello won by only a small margin last time. (Virginia election results)Ohio's 15th and 16th districts. A few months ago, I asked strategists from both parties to each pick a district that they thought exemplified the election for their side. The Democrats picked the 15th because Mary Jo Kilroy, the Democrat running in a rematch against Republican Steve Stivers, stood to benefit from a concentrated national effort to turn out the vote in her area. The Republicans picked the 16th District because it leans Republican, incumbent Democrat John Boccieri is a freshman, and the district was one of the 48 John McCain won. (Ohio election results)Colorado's 4th and 7th districts. Democrat Betsy Markey in the 4th should be a casualty of the night. She's in a strong Republican district that John McCain carried two years ago. In the 7th, Democrat Ed Perlmutter represents a Democratic district Obama carried with 59 percent of the vote. Democrats drawn by Colorado's Senate race should help him. (Colorado election results) Democratic hopesIf you are a Democrat you can light a little candle for the few Republican seats that your party might pick up. For every one that the Democrats win, the Republican pick up needs to be one seat greater. They might be the difference between Republicans needing 39 seats and 44 seats. The districts to watch are Delaware's at-large, Florida's 25th, Hawaii's 1st, Illinois 10th, Louisiana's 2nd and California's 3rd and Washington's 8th. Five Senate races to watchTo review: Republicans have to take 10 Senate seats from Democrats to gain control of the Senate. Three are pretty much gone: Indiana, North Dakota, and Arkansas. Wisconsin looks good for Republicans. Of the six remaining, almost all are toss-ups. This means it could be a very late night of vote counting. If Democrats win the early-poll-closing states of Pennsylvania and West Virginia, the GOP will have to run the table the rest of the night--including California, which looks tough going into Election Day. Here's a quick rundown of places to watch to see how the night is going. West Virginia: Joe Manchin is a popular governor, but that hasn't translated into an advantage in his Senate race. Watch Cabell County, the second largest in the state, it may be the swing county. The southern-border counties of Logan, Mingo, and Raleigh are Democratic territory. It's coal country, which is why Manchin was firing his rifle at the cap-and-trade legislation in his advertising. Republican John Raese has gone after those voters, too. (West Virginia election results)Pennsylvania: Obama campaigned just a few days ago in Philadelphia. Did he turn out students and African-American voters for Democrat Joe Sestak? The suburbs around Philadelphia--Montgomery, Bucks, and Chester counties--are the key area to watch. Democrats outnumber Republicans by about 1.2 million in Pennsylvania, but independent voters, one-fifth of whom said they were still undecided heading into Election Day, will be as crucial to the election as they have been in the past. Obama won independents and moderates by 20 points  in 2008, but in a recent Quinnipiac poll, Republican Pat Toomey was way ahead among independents, 52 percent to 39 percent. (Pennsylvania election results)Nevada: This is a classic test of turnout vs. enthusiasm. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has the former and none of the latter. For Sharron Angle, the situation is reversed. Can Reid turn out a lot of Democrats in Clark County around Las Vegas? That's the state's largest county and a Democratic stronghold. A crucial House race in the 3rd District between Joe Heck and Dina Titus may be one place to see which party is turning out voters. Washoe County is a traditional swing area, but Angle is from there. Will familiarity breed contempt or give her the win? Also, watch how the ""none of the above"" does. If it's more than three or four percentage points, that means voters are protesting but not voting for Angle, which is good for Reid. (Nevada election results)Illinois: Perhaps it's a sign of the dire political mood that the trophy race for Obama's old Senate seat is so tarnished. Democrat Alexi Giannoulias was a loan officer for his family bank that made loans to people connected with organized crime. Republican Mark Kirk serially embellished his resume. Republicans had hoped to make this a ""character"" campaign about the Democrat, but as one GOP strategist said, ""You can't do that when your candidate has no character."" Republicans have tried to make Giannoulias a captive of the Chicago machine, and he'll have to hope that machine turns out the vote for him in Chicago. Kirk will rely on the traditionally more conservative voters in the southern part of the state. He represented the affluent 10th Congressional District outside Chicago and will rely on those suburban voters in the collar counties around the big city: DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and Will. (Illinois election results)Colorado: Strategists from both parties agree that incumbent Democrat Sen. Michael Bennet has run a good campaign and Ken Buck has not run a great one. That may not matter if this is a big wave election. Adams, Arapahoe, and Jefferson counties circle Denver and are considered Colorado's swing counties. Bennet has to hope he can appeal to moderate voters and women there. Republicans need to turn out their vote in El Paso (Colorado Springs), Douglas (south of Denver), Weld (Eastern Plains), and Mesa (Western Slope) counties. Also look to Larimer, a northern county in the middle of the state, that has a strong Tea Party movement. Both Bennet and Buck did well there during the primaries. (Colorado election results)Washington: If control of the Senate is close, this one could keep us up for days. Most voters cast their ballots by mail. You can do so on Election Day, and the final vote isn't made official for 10 days. One-quarter of the vote comes in after the polling places close. The calculus here is simple. Patty Murray, the incumbent Democrat, will try to turn out voters in King County, home of Seattle. She'll have to match her turnout in '98 and '04, which was about 65 percent. If she can do that, she can split the vote in the counties that border King: Snohomish and Pierce. Republican Dino Rossi has to do well in Clark County in the southwest corner and in the GOP strongholds in the east. (Washington election results) Governors' races to watchOn big national election nights, governors don't get the love they should. Yet there are two important reasons to pay attention: redistricting and battleground positioning. Governors play an important role in the once-a-decade process of redrawing congressional districts. The party in control of the governor's mansion and the legislature can draw those districts in a way that helps members of their party get elected. In Texas, the last time this happened, the Republicans who ran the show took six congressional seats away from Democrats. The key states to watch with big redistricting implications are: Ohio: Republicans need challenger John Kasich to defeat incumbent Democrat Ted Strickland--and pick up seven seats in the state legislature--to gain control. (Ohio results)Florida: Republicans already control the legislature, and a win by GOP candidate Rick Scott, who is dead even with Democrat Alex Sink, would give the party a lock in the state. (Florida results)Pennsylvania: Republican candidate Tom Corbett leads Democrat Dan Onorato. If the GOP wins the race for governor, Democrats have to hold their slim seven-seat majority in the state House. (Pennsylvania results) In both Michigan and Wisconsin, the GOP candidate is favored for governor. Democrats have to hope that the Michigan House stays in their party and that in Wisconsin they hold on to narrow majorities in the House or Senate. The other reason to pay attention to governor's races is that many of them are in key presidential battleground states. Strategists believe that a candidate has an easier time in a state if he or she can take advantage of the organization of the top elected official there. Nine key battleground states totaling 121 electoral votes are up for grabs in 2010: the five above plus Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, and Iowa. How enthusiastic?There was indeed a giant enthusiasm gap in this election: between the people who used that term repeatedly and the audience who grew sick of it quickly. Now we'll see just how much more fired up conservatives were than Democrats. The key figure to watch going into the election was the difference between registered voters and likely voters. In the last Gallup poll, Democrats were down among both: Republicans led among registered voters 48 percent to 44 percent and among likely voters by a whopping 15 points, 55 percent to 40 percent. It was, said Gallup, ""a lead large enough to suggest that regardless of turnout, the Republicans will win more than the 40 seats needed to give them the majority in the U.S. House."" So the question of the evening Tuesday is not whether Democrats can match Republicans everywhere. They can't. The question is whether, when Democrats put on their full effort in specific places, they were able to build a wall against Republican advances. Specific toss-up districts to watch to see if all the effort paid off: Ohio's 1st, Ohio's 15th, Wisconsin's 7th, Nevada's 3rd, and New York's 1st. Is Obama toxic?A number of Democrats tried to keep their distance from President Obama this year.  Gubernatorial candidate Alex Sink didn't want him to come back to Florida. In West Virginia, Joe Manchin--the governor and a candidate for Senate--refused to endorse Obama's re-election. In Indiana's 2nd District, Rep. Joe Donnelly ran an ad touting his conservative stance on immigration over pictures of Obama and Pelosi. ""That may not be what the Washington crowd wants, but I don't work for them,"" Donnelly says. ""I work for you."" Rep. Gene Taylor in Mississippi's 4th District said he didn't vote for Obama. (And all this is to say nothing of the Democratic voters who are distancing themselves from  Obama. A recent AP poll showed 47 percent want him to have a primary challenge.) Other candidates under threat did embrace Obama. Rep. Tom Perriello of Virginia called for the firing of Obama's economic advisers earlier this year, but he welcomed the president's visit at the end of the campaign. Sen. Barbara Boxer appeared with Obama at a late rally in California and put him in her final ad. Incumbent Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland of Ohio campaigned with Obama several times, including just a few days before the election. Which group of candidates--those who invited the president in, or those who kept their distance--fares better on Election Day is another theme worth watching. Which ""old bulls"" will go down?During the final pre-election excitement, when the projection for Republican gains appeared to grow by an order of magnitude every day, there was talk about 26-term veteran John Dingell being under threat of losing his seat. If the longest-serving member in House history loses, it will be a gargantuan night for the GOP. Most election prognosticators don't believe that will happen. But that doesn't mean there won't be losses among members who have been in the House for a long time. Places to look for possible career-enders: 18-term Rep. James Oberstar of Minnesota, 17-term Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri, 14-term Rep. Rick Boucher of Virginia, 15-term Rep.  Barney Frank of Massachusetts, 14-term Rep. John Spratt of South Carolina, and 13-term Rep. Paul Kanjorski of Pennsylvania. Someone is going to make historyNo matter what happens tonight it will be historic. Here are some bits of history that are likely to be undone: In the House takeover years of 1994 by Republicans and 2006 by Democrats, no incumbent of either winning party lost. In Pennsylvania, the governor's office switches parties every eight years, which means Republican Tom Corbett should win. But in Pennsylvania an attorney general has never won the office of governor, which means the Democrat Dan Onorato should win.Since World War II, the House has changed parties six times and in every case the Senate has switched, too.Colleen Hanabusa in Hawaii can retake the 1st Congressional District from six-month incumbent Charles Djou, a Republican who won it in a special election. But in the state's entire history, a federal office-holder has never been kicked out of office.

6	6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/i_still_love_obama_love_love_love.html	"Just before Halloween 2008, while out for a walk, I noticed that on the front porch of a nearby house sat a row of five pumpkins, each carved with one letter of Barack Obama's last name. The election was, at that point, a week away, and I was charmed by this seasonal display of Democratic support. Then I rounded the corner and spotted the exact same arrangement: a row of five pumpkins, each carved with one letter of Obama's last name. OK, so maybe not quite as original as I'd thought but still encouraging, at least for a liberal like me living in a swing state--my neighborhood, after all, is not in Brooklyn or Berkeley but in suburban St. Louis, Mo., a state that ultimately, by a margin of 0.1 percent, didn't go for Obama in '08. This Halloween, it was clear that if I wanted to see a row of jack-o'-bamas, I'd need to carve them myself. Where once it was impossible not to trip over Obama enthusiasm, much of it shown by people not usually all that invested in politics and in ways that went well beyond bumper stickers or pins (remember the trend of young voters unofficially changing their middle names to Hussein?), these days, not only are Tea Partiers boiling over with fury at Obama, but even Obama campaign stalwarts Shepard Fairey of the Hope poster and YouTube sensation Obama Girl are feeling lukewarm about our president: Obama Girl, aka Amber Lee Ettinger, told the New York Post in January she'd give Obama a B- grade: ""In my opinion, I feel like he should be focusing a lot more on jobs and the economy."" But my own feelings haven't changed at all. Two years after voting for him, I'm just as exhilarated as Oprah Winfrey was in Grant Park on Nov. 4, 2008. You might say, to borrow the accusation frequently leveled at the 2008 media, that I've remained in the tank for Obama. The only problem is that, currently, I seem to be in the tank by myself. Earlier this fall, when even NPR hosts were making jokes that could have been borrowed from Rush Limbaugh--the teaser for a recent episode of Wait Wait ... Don't Tell Me! imagined that one of the ""inspiring"" quotations in the new Oval Office carpet was, ""At least your daughters still like you ... probably""--I felt the unmistakable loneliness of being the last one left at a formerly hopping party. Honestly, though, I'm surprised that so many people have turned against the president. Obviously, if you've lost your job, life is tough, but did voters really believe the country was going to quickly and dramatically reverse course once he was elected? So he hasn't yet made good on every campaign promise--isn't this like being shocked that you didn't lose as much weight doing Jenny Craig as Valerie Bertinelli did, or that your new memory-foam mattress didn't magically cure your insomnia? It's not that I can't understand voters' frustration with, for example, the fact that the Guantanamo Bay detention camp is still open. So Obama is an imperfect president--who wouldn't be? During the almost two years he's been in office, I (apparently alone among sentient voters) don't think he's made any major missteps: As far as I can tell, the economic stimulus package might not have been perfect, but it prevented something bad from being even worse. Health care reform will offer better coverage--or coverage, period--to millions of Americans, including children and those with pre-existing conditions. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is providing billions of dollars to improve education and infrastructure. And, hell, I have no idea what Obama could have done differently with the oil spill, with the possible exception of not succumbing to political pressure and so-called optics by making Sasha go swimming with him off the coast of Florida. So he hasn't yet gotten Congress to repeal ""don't ask, don't tell""--at least he's explicitly assured us he wants to, and he recently indicated his view on gay marriage could ""evolve."" And, yes, it did give me pause in December 2009 when he announced that he was sending more troops to Afghanistan, but here's the thing: Although he was criticized for taking too long to decide on that plan, I was reassured by his aversion to acting hastily. In general, when I hear the criticisms of Obama--that he's professorial or wonky or emotionally restrained, that he's willing to listen to various points of view, that he likes arugula--I often think, wait, those are supposed to be insults? But, my fellow Americans, how quickly we forget! After an excruciating eight years of Bush, the thrill still hasn't worn off for me of once again having an intellectually nimble president, not to mention one who doesn't pride himself on going with his gut when it comes to foreign policy. Whenever I watched Bush speak extemporaneously, I'd feel alternately embarrassed by and for him. I'd be tempted to cover my eyes, as if watching a clumsy figure skater botching double Lutz jumps. And whenever I interacted with someone from another country, I'd feel compelled to mention that I hadn't voted for Bush. But when I see Obama on television, I'm unfailingly struck by his intelligence and charisma, by his easygoing humor, by the magnificence of his megawatt smile. He just makes me proud, and perhaps this is where I should admit that if there are two categories of Obama critics--conservatives who never liked the guy and have in some cases become unhinged since he was elected, and centrists or Democrats who voted for him but now feel let down--I suspect that, in the visceral nature of my response to our president, I have more in common with the unhinged nut jobs. By this I mean that my Obama admiration is a kind of emotional inverse of the right-wing Obama antipathy: I can pretend it's all about policy, but in truth, it's much more personal. Where his detractors dislike him because of, say, that Muslim vibe he gives off, I like him for similarly nebulous, albeit slightly more factual reasons. I like that he's married to--and seemingly still quite taken with--a strong, opinionated, gorgeous woman, and that he has two ridiculously cute daughters. I like his mind-bendingly multicultural extended family. I like that in a campaign interview in Glamour magazine, he could fluently and unabashedly talk about Pap smears. I thought that the beer summit of 2009 was delightful. I was even excited when Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize, not realizing until pundits explained otherwise that I was supposed to be aghast at its prematurity. And I wasn't a bit offended by Obama's alleged 2008 debate gaffe--a line the otherwise irreproachable Frank Rich mentioned yet again in a column as recently as September--in remarking to Hillary Clinton, ""You're likable enough, Hillary."" Oh, and did I mention that I actually voted for Hillary in Missouri's Democratic primary? I was one of those Democrats who thought it'd be nice to have an entree of eight years of Hillary, with Obama as a vice-presidential side, followed by eight years of a more seasoned Obama as the main course. I was always an Obama admirer, but maybe the fact that I was initially rooting for Hillary has prevented me from feeling the disappointment in his presidency expressed by certain Obamamaniacs. So swoony and ardent was their Obama love during the campaign that it couldn't be sustained; my more measured affection, by contrast, has grown over time. At this point, I love Obama so much that I recently thought if it were 1961, I'd probably display a bust of him in my living room. Then I realized I'm already displaying the 2010 equivalent: On my living room wall, I have a framed version of that famous November 2008 New Yorker cover of the O moon over the Lincoln Memorial. Meanwhile, on my desk, I keep a printed-out photo I first saw on the Huffington Post in May 2009, of Obama in the Oval Office, bending over so a little African-American boy could rub his head. The boy, it turns out, was the child of a White House staffer, and the reason Obama was bending was, according to the caption in the White House's Flickr account, ""The youngster wanted to see if the President's haircut felt like his own."" I don't care if it's good PR--the picture still practically brings tears to my eyes. It reminds me of the sense of excitement and possibility I felt in November 2008, as if in electing Obama, we Americans were acting as our best, smartest, least racist selves, as if there really was change we could believe in. And, OK, so it's been a long two years since then, and for a lot of people it's been an undeniably hard two years. But I'm just not convinced that's Obama's fault. I'm also not convinced, my own hyperbolic tendencies aside, that I'm really the last Obama devotee standing. When I ask around, I find that the people who are disappointed in Obama aren't as disappointed as the media would have us believe, and that many aren't disappointed at all. In fact, some acquaintances have told me that they, too, feel surprised by the assumption that the Obama backlash is universal. Sure, a lot of the people I know are like me--Whole Foods shoppers, NPR listeners, Slate readers and writers--but I do live in a state where I'd be unable to avoid voters of varying political persuasions even if I wanted to. During the years of George W. Bush's presidency, a popular magnet among my Democratic friends featured a serious photo of Bill Clinton, his hands clasped. ""COME BACK BILL,"" the punctuation-free text read. ""ALL IS FORGIVEN."" My fear is that if Democrats continue to convince one another, and swing voters, of our president's failures and shortcomings, a similar Obama magnet might surge in popularity as soon as 2013--during a Mitt Romney administration, or a Mike Huckabee administration, or, God forbid, a Sarah Palin administration. But even if my worst political nightmare comes to pass, I know I will never buy that magnet. After all, I've never thought there's anything for which to forgive Obama. Like  Slate on Facebook.

In the final weeks and days of the campaign the messages from both parties have been consistent, regardless of the race. Republicans have sought to tie Democrats to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and President Obama. Democrats have tried to tie Republicans to the Chinese. Though the messages are similar, one area where ad makers can show their creativity is in picking the gruesome shot of their candidate's opponent. There are a wide variety of ways to make your opponent look sinister, goofy, and unrecognizable to even his own mother. The trick, says a strategist involved in several races, is to ""make your opponent unattractive or alien without making the exercise cartoonish or unbelievable.""

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/this_is_a_test.html	"CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va.--Why did Barack Obama decide to campaign for Rep. Tom Perriello, of all members of the House, on the Friday before Election Day? Obama said it was a test. ""We always say we want integrity from our politicians,"" he told the crowd in Charlottesville. ""Well you know what? This is a test case right here."" The race to represent Virginia's 5th District in the House does test whether a Democrat who supported most of the administration's signature policies--and, unlike most Democrats, campaigned on them--can survive. But it's also a test for Obama, particularly whether he can gin up the same levels of enthusiasm that drove Democrats to the polls in 2008. To that end, Obama and Perriello did everything to make 2010 seem like 2008. ""Two years ago, we defied the pundits,"" said Perriello in his speech. ""Two years ago, we rejected everyone else's definition of what is possible in politics and turned Virginia blue for the first time."" Obama explained why voters who came out in 2008 should really come out this time: ""2008, that wasn't the end goal. It wasn't to elect a president. It was to keep building a movement for change."" He also said that while the initial magic wears off, the need for good policymaking doesn't. ""The inauguration, that fades,"" he said. ""Beyonce was singing, Bono was there. All that stuff fades. But that spirit can't fade."" It's clear why Obama likes Perriello. Perriello's message is, in short, ""more of the same."" But whereas Republicans say that as if it's a bad thing, Perriello emphasizes the good. At a time when many Democrats are distancing themselves from their party's accomplishments, Perriello is doubling down. He defends health care reform and the stimulus package, both of which he voted for. (He voted against Wall Street reform, but only because it didn't go far enough.) His decision to embrace his record--and large parts of Obama's--helps Obama argue that not all Democrats are spurning him. That seemed to be the message when Obama mentioned Perriello favorably in his ""The Daily Show"" appearance on Wednesday. Perriello's double-down strategy is especially bold--or foolish, depending how you view it--given that Virginia's 5th District is historically Republican. In retrospect, his victory in 2008 looks like a fluke. He beat the six-term Republican incumbent, Virgil Goode, by about 700 votes--the closest margin in the country. Not even Obama won the district. But the blue tide, combined with Goode's penchant for talking about ""anchor babies,"" pushed Perriello over the threshold. No matter how many campaign stops Obama makes, Perriello can't count on the same wave this time around. Voters have soured on the administration. Democratic enthusiasm is down. (Perriello says his voters are an exception.) In parts of his district, unemployment is above 20 percent. Another difference between now and 2008 is that voters now have a sense of what ""change"" is. This is good and bad. On the one hand, Perriello talked about students getting Pell grants, homeowners getting loans, and sick people getting care they previously would have been denied thanks to legislation he voted for. On the other hand, bragging about concrete changes gives his opponent specific programs or policies to rail against rather than generalized rhetoric about tax hikes and growing government. But Perriello is still going for the Hail Mary. He has help, to put it mildly. Outside groups have poured millions of dollars into the race, including $1.6 million from liberal organizations like the League of Conservation Voters in the last 10 days. His opponent, state senator Robert Hurt, is also getting outside aid, but not as much as Perriello. As for whether Obama's appearance will help or hurt, Perriello argues for the former. ""Look, I haven't agreed with every decision the president has made,"" he says. (He says this a lot.) ""But there was a group of people who said we're not going to let another Depression happen on our watch. Either you stand with the people trying to solve it, or you stand with the people who caused it."" Obama may help in deep-blue Charlottesville, but the rest of the district is a different story. Perriello spent the first half of the day in Martinsville, Va., a town near the North Carolina border that's about as far from Charlottesville as you can get--geographically and politically. Martinsville has been in a recession a lot longer then the rest of the country. For decades, it was a manufacturing town specializing in textiles and furniture. DuPont Chemical opened the world's largest nylon plant there in 1941. But in the 1990s, one factory after another shut down. The local economy still hadn't recovered when the nationwide recession hit. ""It's important to explain what happened,"" Perriello says. People blame Democrats for the state of the economy, he says, but that's not fair. The economy was terrible when the Democrats entered office. They averted a disaster the Republicans created. He's since been focused on the economy ""like a laser""--and that includes passing health care reform. ""It all goes back to the big idea: How will America out-compete the world?"" For example, he says, we're not going to beat China if our health care system is dragging down businesses. Perriello is happy to make the case for extending Democratic rule. But the strategy now seems to be less about persuading on-the-fence voters than mobilizing his northern, urban base. Hence the Obama rally. In Charlottesville, University of Virginia students started gathering at the gate to the pavilion Friday morning. Many students from out of town have registered there in order to vote. In the final days, Perriello will keep crisscrossing the district. But no matter how much time he spends shaking hands in Martinsville--he's visited the place 76 times, he says--his fate is in the hands of the believers.Like Slate on  Facebook.

9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/all_politics_is_national.html	"After President Obama hugged Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida in February 2009, Crist's career went into decline. Alex Sink, the Democrat running to replace him, didn't want the same thing to happen to her, so Obama did not make a stop in Florida in the closing weeks of the campaign. How toxic is Obama? The Republican candidate for governor in Florida, Rick Scott, was chief executive of a company that paid the largest fine in history, more than $1.7 billion, for Medicare fraud. Democrats involved in the race say polls show that it is more damaging for a candidate to be associated with Obama than Medicare fraud. That's why Scott has consistently tried to tie Sink to Obama. Florida, you might remember, is a swing state with 27 electoral votes. There are 37 governor's races this year, but not all of them are created equal. Seven battleground states, plus Florida, are up for grabs. In these states, whichever party holds the governor's office will have a head start in putting together a field organization for its presidential nominee. But that's not all. Many of those states, plus a few others, will gain or lose congressional seats as the reapportionment and redistricting process reshape the House for the next decade. The president is more welcome in Ohio than in Florida. Incumbent Ted Strickland, the Democrat, is in a tight race with former Rep. John Kasich, and Obama will campaign in Cleveland on his last stop before Election Day. It will be the president's 12th visit to a state that is pretty much a must-win for him in 2012. Nathan Daschle, the executive director of the Democratic Governors Association (and the son of the former Senate majority leader), looks at the 17 or so close races in terms of electoral votes. In the 2008 presidential race, Obama won Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan, New Mexico, Wisconsin and Nevada. Six of those eight states had Democratic governors. This year, all of those governor's offices may go Republican--putting a total of 112 electoral votes under GOP control. (A caveat: Obama's 2008 victories came with a Republican governor in Nevada and Florida. While the political class puts a lot of stock in the idea that governors can help presidential candidates of their party, academics have found little evidence of that influence.) There is one area, though, where governors and local politicians do have influence. Nathan Larger is a Republican running to be the state representative in the 24th district of Ohio. Like most candidates this year, he's talking about jobs. Voters ""want to see the jobs come back to Ohio,"" he says. How much impact one state representative can have on the job outlook of his constituents is unclear. But if he's elected, Larger could have a huge impact on the job prospects of Ohio's Republican politicians. If the GOP can take over the Ohio House and the governor's office, it will control the process by which the state's members of Congress are selected for the next decade. Democrats only hold a seven seat majority in the Ohio House. After the 2010 census results become official, Ohio could lose as many as two of its 18 congressional seats. Ten years ago it lost one seat, and Republicans used the opportunity to redraw the boundaries in their favor--allowing them to gain three seats from the Democrats. ""The course of our party and the future of our party for the next decade in the state of Ohio hangs in the balance of the elections in 2010,"" says Ohio GOP Chairman Kevin DeWine. Garnet Coleman, a Democrat who represents a state district in Houston, saw Republicans reshape Texas' political map during redistricting almost a decade ago. After the 2000 elections Democrats had a 17-13 edge. Republicans redrew the state's map after the 2002 election, and now the GOP controls 20 seats to the Democrats' 12. The competition means local races have started looking like national ones, with cable-television advertising and sophisticated voter targeting. The high stakes mean that even the smallest local issues are bitterly contested. ""This is a crucial year and everyone knows it"" says Coleman. ""It's nastier and more divisive in particular because it can come down to 100 votes."" Texas is likely to gain four seats. In Texas, Democrats had hoped they were closing in on Republican Rick Perry, but polls show him pulling away. Florida is likely to gain a seat (for a total of 26). The state legislature is controlled by Republicans, which is why the governor's race is so important. The governor can veto the legislative redistricting map. Pennsylvania is likely to lose a congressional seat. If they lose the governor's race, Democrats have to hope they hold on to their narrow 104-98 majority in the Pennsylvania House. In Michigan and Wisconsin, where the governor is likely to be a Republican, Democrats have to hope they can hold on to some power in the legislature. Strategists for both parties say the reapportionment and redistricting process could determine the control of up to 25 congressional seats. While everyone is looking to see which party controls the House next year, the other big prize will go to the party that improved its chances to control the House for many years to come.

10	10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/citizen_russ.html	"EAU CLAIRE, Wis.--It's Pat Kreitlow's job to introduce Russ Feingold on Tuesday night. The third-term senator is waiting behind a curtain; in front of the curtain are about 200 Democrats, half of them students at the University of Wisconsin campus here. Kreitlow is a state senator, on the ballot this year, but he used to be a journalist and academic, and he uses this occasion to give a history lesson. ""Let me tell you something about angry millionaires,"" says Kreitlow. ""They can buy a lot of stuff. After they buy the houses, plural, after they buy the cars, after they buy the club memberships, there's other things that some of them can do with their money."" Heads start nodding. Kreitlow has packed a lot of references in there. Feingold's opponent, Ron Johnson, is a plastics manufacturer who got into the race in May and opened his wallet. His most notable prior engagement with politics was inviting conservative scholar Charles Murray to his hometown, Oshkosh, for a lecture on education. He has proudly said he never visited Washington, ever, until being dragged there this year for campaign meetings. Hours before this rally, the Onion published a parody column ""by"" Johnson in which the ur-novice argued that it was time for ""an outsider who doesn't even know what casting a vote means."" So, not much question who the chief ""angry millionaire"" is. ""This isn't class warfare,"" says Kreitlow. ""This is about that angry sliver of the very well-off who think that along with buying the houses, and the cars, and everything else, maybe we ought to buy a cable network. Maybe we ought to buy some newspapers. Maybe we ought to buy a whole bunch of radio stations, because then we're buying the message machine, and then we can buy elections. It's not briefcases full of money that go to candidates, necessarily. It's buying the message machine, and the players involved who are going to make the decisions, from that horrible Citizens United case before the Supreme Court, to an obstructionist congressional minority not doing what you and I all voted for in 2006 and 2008!"" There's less of a cheer at this--more of a collective sigh. Yep, that's the election. In no other state has the Democrats' last-ditch argument--that shadowy, possibly foreign-influenced business interests are trying to buy the election--been as powerful a motivator as it has been in Wisconsin. This is a state that's lost at least tens of thousands of jobs to outsourcing since the passage of NAFTA, jobs that are especially missed as the Great Recession has killed tens of thousands more. There is not much to be done about that right now. But it makes what President Obama and Sen. Feingold and the rest of the Democrats are saying even more outrageous. ""Citizens United is hurting us,"" says Michael Turner, a Democratic activist running for sheriff in Eau Claire. ""We've got loads and gobs of undisclosed money on issue ads. Because there's no disclosure, there's no reason to tell the truth. The incentive to be credible is completely gone. You can pay for a huge smear campaign and have nobody know where it came from."" Of course, this isn't why Feingold is stubbornly behind in the polls to Johnson, or why Democrats are in danger of losing three House seats, the governorship, and control of the state legislature. Democrats are in trouble in Wisconsin, first and foremost, because voters are not happy with the party's efforts to combat the recession. And Democrats do get this. ""I guess [Obama] didn't live up to my wildest dreams,"" says Steph Regenauer, a student at the university who's signed up to volunteer all weekend. ""But that's how it goes."" And Kristen Dexter, a freshman state representative who also addresses the crowd, admits that the health care bill that may cost Feingold his career ""may not have happened the way we wanted, but it was a good start."" She says this, again, to a room of partisan Democrats. At an event Monday, in the small north-central Wisconsin town of Rhinelander, I talked briefly with Feingold and posed this question. Was Johnson's generic, kick-the-bums-out, stop-all-the-spending campaign working because voters didn't think Democrats had delivered? When Johnson refused to get specific about how to create jobs, did that hit home because Democrats said the stimulus would create jobs and voters don't think it did? ""It's something you have to work hard on,"" said Feingold. ""The fact that 95 percent of the people, working families, got a tax cut is something that has not been adequately stressed. I've been stressing it all year. I think people are beginning to realize, though, as they see projects in their communities, the highway projects, the fact that we have a wonderful new senior center in Plymouth, a new wastewater-treatment plant here in Rhinelander--these things, people are now sort of admitting that it probably did a good job."" If voters are benefiting, then why don't they know it? ""The rhetoric of the Republicans here is to pretend that it did absolutely nothing,"" said Feingold. ""I don't think the issue is decisive--I think that in the end, people know we had to do it. It didn't solve the whole problem. They're looking for the belief that things will get better more quickly. The question is who is more likely to get that done."" Feingold has an advantage that some endangered Democrats are lacking: He's genuinely adored by his base. The idea that he could lose is not just shocking but also cosmically unfair. Eighteen years working on campaign finance reform and the Supreme Court unspools his legislation? A lifetime of public service that's kept him poor, and he's being out-man-of-the-peopled by a wealthy industrialist? It doesn't matter that Democrats are actually withstanding the ""secret money"" onslaught with money of their own--it just doesn't seem fair. In Rhinelander, a local activist named Kay Hoff, who stressed that she's the winner of the ""Eleanor Roosevelt award"" for political activism, hoisted a sign that read, ""I Don't Want My Government Run Like a Plastics Factory."" ""Call me foolish,"" says Rep. Ron Kind, who is in a dogfight to keep representing Eau Claire. ""But I think it's important that we still have one poor person serving in the Senate. If Johnson buys this election, he'd be the 72nd multimillionaire in the Senate."" And that's a huge part of the Feingold closing message: Johnson's one of them. At his Eau Claire rally, Feingold says that Johnson's ""support for shipping Wisconsin jobs to other countries has been a gamechanger,"" that every major state newspaper is endorsing Feingold because Johnson won't talk about what he'd do if elected, and that voting against Feingold is handing a victory to the moneyed interests that are robbing them. ""He's got over $2 million of those hidden ads, those Citizens United ads that we haven't seen before,"" says Feingold. ""Chamber of Commerce, you know, runs these ads. They just bought $700,000 for the next five days. Nobody has any idea where the money's coming from or who it is."" A voice in the crowd growls ""China!"" It's not clear whether Feingold can hear it, but he answers it anyway. ""We have a pretty good idea, don't we? It's the huge corporate interests that already dominate our government, and Mr. Johnson says that's OK!"" If Feingold loses his seat, Wisconsin Democrats will know why. It was purchased at a discount. Voters were softened up by Fox News and talk radio and didn't realize what the party was doing for them, that the economy was coming back. ""We're not good at tooting our own horns,"" grumbles Dean Scanlon, a laborer making calls for the Democrats. ""Nobody's real happy right now,"" Feingold tells me, ""but they're sure not happy with the Republicans."" The trick for Democrats in Wisconsin--across the de-industrializing Midwest, really--is convincing voters that they can trace their problems to big money and free trade, and that they'll be more unhappy with the Republicans than they are now with the Democrats.

The Tea Party Express is not Tea Party Patriots. FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity can't stand each other, and only one of them has taken money from the Kochs. Oath Keepers and the Campaign for Liberty both trace their origins to the 2008 Ron Paul presidential campaign, but Paul's only involved with one of them. What follows is a taxonomy, in rough chronological order, of the main organizations that have made, or been remade by, the Tea Party movement. Some of them predate Rick Santelli's February 2009 CNBC rant that really kicked off the movement. Some of them are defined by feuds with other groups. Some of them are pro-Republican; some of them hate both parties. Now you can keep them straight.  Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter.

Duffy, a Republican district attorney from the far north of the rambling 7th Congressional District, is facing Julie Lassa, a Democratic state senator from its southeastern end, in Tuesday's election. When he and Lassa take the stage in front of four student moderators in the Chippewa Falls High School cafeteria, she stiffly thanks them before saying she was raised on a farm and noting (as she will often over the next hour) that Duffy wants to outsource jobs to China. Duffy doesn't swing back. Instead, he lays on the charm. ""Paulie, happy birthday!"" he tells one moderator. ""I hear you're 18 today. You can vote on November 2. Also, I've got somewhat of a fond history with Chi-Hi. I used to play hockey, and we had a nice rivalry with you."" He offers up a short bio: ""I grew up doing lumberjack competitions and exhibitions. That's chopping, sawing, log-rolling, tree-climbing."" National Republicans would like these last few debates to be formalities. As far as they know, Duffy locked up this seat in May, when incumbent Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., pronounced himself ""bone tired"" and announced his retirement. Republicans saw Duffy as a rising star, and here was his opportunity. So as he campaigned, he basked in national media attention based mostly on his roles in The Real Word: Boston and Road Rules.  He met his future wife, Rachel Campos-Duffy, on Road Rules: All Stars, and today she's a professional pundit on all things conservative and motherhood-related. * His TV ads have played on his professional lumberjack past. In one he chops ""the big spending in Washington"" with an ax; in another, he runs on a log and knocks off a ""professional politician."" In both ads he is wearing flannel. On Monday night it's impossible to forget that Duffy's been in the spotlight for most of his life. Lassa is 40, Duffy is 39, but the debate goes off like a scene from some 1980s college movie in which the fraternity president outsmarts the dean. She clings tightly to talking points, repeatedly saying Duffy supports ""policies that send our good-paying jobs overseas."" She has notes and uses them. Duffy just talks. She says again that Duffy fails to realize that Wisconsin is losing jobs because of bad trade deals and ""tax breaks that ship our jobs overseas."" Duffy shakes his head and makes with the folksy. ""They're packin' up and goin' elsewhere because they can't do business in Wisconsin!"" he says. ""If you talk to businesses, they say: 'We're not leaving because of the workers in Wisconsin. We're leaving because of policies in Madison.' And Sen. Lassa has a leading role in developing those policies that make Wisconsin one of the worst places in the country to do business."" The student questioner stumbles a bit in an attempt to ask Lassa a follow-up. Lassa doesn't seem sure how to answer it, either. ""Certainly we need to, just like the Department of Commerce has recommended""--new sentence--""is for their paper products that are coming here, a 115 percent tariff, because they are unfairly competing against us""--new sentence--""but also the policies dealing with currency manipulation."" This is a polite crowd. The only time they laugh is when Duffy makes them; he has a habit of smiling and saying ""I'm done"" when he finishes his answers. Duffy's appeal isn't just personal, of course. In another year, voters could face the same choice--the Republican breezily handling questions, the Democrat clinging to the podium like a life raft--and Democrats wouldn't be worried. But in 2010, all Duffy has to do is remind voters of how bad things are. What Lassa has to do is convince a critical mass of Democrats and independents that they should direct their anger at trade agreements and the possible Republican threat to Social Security. That's not enough for some angry swing voters. Steve Gilbertson, a retired army officer from Chippewa Falls, says he came to the debate with an open mind, having voted for Democrats in plenty of elections, although he backed John McCain in 2008. ""We need to reduce spending, and we need to tax everyone equally."" He repeats himself. ""Everyone, equally. She wants to tax the rich and not the poor, and that doesn't work. I was disappointed, you know, because the NRA had rated her so high. She lost my vote tonight."" This drives Democrats crazy. They see Duffy as glib and superficial, expert at delivering a bold statement about how Wisconsin needs jobs as if he has a Green Lantern ring to will them into existence. ""He acted like he could do anything,"" says Mary Kelly, a Lassa supporter. ""Just say the word 'jobs' and they're created. He didn't give me any indication that he would make hard decisions, which is what being a legislator means."" Ironically, Democrats used to have a candidate who actually could do that. His name was David Obey. He voted the way the NRA wanted as he shoveled money to the district and loudly registered his outrage at whatever the Democrats were screwing up that day. As the chairman of the Appropriations Committee who pushed through the stimulus, he raged at the White House for ""stupid mistakes"" that convinced the public that the bill was a boondoggle. Even here, in Obey's district, you can find examples of how little confidence people have in the stimulus. ""You hear about another wasteful project every week!"" says Sandy Kenner, a retiree who moved to the area from Illinois. ""What was the last one? Something about studying mice in California. Something ridiculous."" She adds that the government could--and should--save a lot of money by defunding NPR. But these are the reasons Obey quit this year. In his resignation letter, he warned that politics had become too small to get anything done. ""I am, frankly, weary of having to beg on a daily basis that both parties recognize that we do no favor for the country if we neglect to make the long-term investments in education, science, health, and energy that are necessary to modernize our economy and decline to raise the revenue needed to pay for those crucial investments,"" Obey wrote. ""I do not want to be in a position as Chairman of the Appropriations Committee of producing and defending lowest common denominator legislation that is inadequate to that task and, given the mood of the country, that is what I would have to do if I stayed."" Was Obey wrong? At a key moment in the Chippewa Falls debate, Lassa attacks Duffy for voicing his support, at times, for Rep. Paul Ryan's ""roadmap,"" a long-term budget plan that would slash entitlement spending. Duffy challenges her to describe the plan, and she reverts to a basic explanation of who Ryan is and why the plan is a threat to Social Security. Duffy goes for the jugular. ""When she's asked what Paul Ryan's plan is, she goes back to her talking point,"" he says. ""It's the same thing over and over that she regurgitates. This is just a campaign gimmick that she's using."" After the debate, a student who'd been handing out programs at the door of the cafeteria approaches Duffy to get his copy signed. He needs a signature to get class credit. I ask him if he's going to get Lassa to sign it, too. ""Naah,"" he says. He goes back to talk to Duffy. Correction, Nov. 2, 2010: This article originally misstated that Duffy met his future wife on The Real World: Boston. ( Return to the corrected sentence.)"

13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/goteav.html	"Measuring the size and impact of the Tea Party has been an ongoing project ever since the movement began in early 2009. What we've learned is they're mostly white, male, Americans older than 45 with higher-than-average income--that is, not much different from the Republican Party. What hasn't been established is how much of a difference the Tea Party can make in the 2010 election. Are the various groups going to mobilize huge numbers of conservatives, thus earning the right to claim they ""won"" the election for the GOP? Or is ""Tea Party"" just useful shorthand for generalized conservative opposition to President Obama, without much organizational acumen? We won't know for sure until after Election Day. But a survey of Tea Party organizations published on Sunday in the Washington Post may give us a hint. Tea Party leaders have always emphasized the organization's disorganization. At a rally last year, Tea Party Patriots co-founder Mark Meckler told me to read  The Starfish and the Spider, a business book about leaderless organizations. There are two kinds of companies, the book posits: ""Spiders"" operate with a central leadership, a head that tells the legs what to do. ""Starfish"" have no central authority--each leg operates on its own. When you hit a spider on the head, it dies. But when you cut off a piece of a starfish, that piece grows into another starfish. (At least among some species.) The Tea Party, says Meckler, is a starfish. The new Post survey suggests a better animal metaphor might be a sloth. The movement appears to be a lot smaller than its spokespeople claim. Tea Party Patriots keeps a list of more than 2,300 local groups. But the Post was only able to verify and reach 647 of them. (A group could have one member or thousands.) Of those groups, only 29 percent were doing any campaigning. And within that group, only two thirds are doing get-out-the-vote efforts, just more than half are sending letters or e-mails, and less than half are making phone calls. That's about 84 groups in the whole country working the phones. That may be enough to swing some tight elections. But it's hardly the tidal wave of enthusiasm that Tea Party leaders and the Republicans who depend on them are hoping for. Which raises the question: Could a centralized Tea Party do a better job getting candidates elected than a diffuse mass? The Tea Party's greatest hits have all benefited from central organization. Glenn Beck and the conservative group FreedomWorks helped gather the masses for the 9/12 rally on the National Mall. Rep. Michele Bachmann organized a protest in August. The National Tea Party Convention was held in Nashville last February by a top-down group called Tea Party Nation. Part of the problem may be that not all Tea Party groups want to get involved in elections. Meckler, for example, hasn't endorsed any candidates. Another Tea Party Patriots organizer, Jenny Beth Martin, emphasized education over electioneering in an interview with National Journal in September. ""If you just tell people to vote but you don't talk about the underlying principles, you just have to do it again and again and again, in every election,"" she said. It's also possible that many Tea Partiers are GOTV-ing through other, non-Tea Party organizations. Adam Brandon, a spokesman for FreedomWorks, argues that the Tea Party's decentralization is an asset, not a liability. Whereas a hierarchical organization needs to appoint a new representative every time it expands, FreedomWorks connects with existing local Tea Party organizations. ""This has given us flexibility to go everywhere,"" says Brandon. There's also evidence that the Tea Party movement has attracted donations it wouldn't otherwise have gotten if it weren't so decentralized. Brandon disputes the idea that not many Tea Partiers are getting out the vote. He cited a CNN pollthat said one in 10 Americans has attended a Tea Party event or given money. ""If 30 percent of this group is active, that's a massive army,"" he says. To say Tea Partiers won't get out the vote is not to say Tea Partiers won't vote. If the  New York Times and  Washington Post surveys tell us anything, it's that they're more enthusiastic and politically engaged than most voters and therefore more likely to vote. What's still unclear is whether they can convince less enthusiastic people to join them. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	Will Tea Partiers get out the vote?	[]	[]
14	14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/bad_neighbor.html	"Each week until the election, I'm posting some of the questions I'm trying to answer based on news of the week or something that's come up in my reporting. Feel free to weigh in with answers--or with more political questions--at  slatepolitics@gmail.com  or in the comments section below. Here are this week's questions: Will Christine O'Donnell cost Republicans two Senate seats? Ever since she won Delaware's Republican nomination for senator in September, the conventional wisdom has been that Christine O'Donnell turned a sure win for Republicans (if Rep. Mike Castle were the nominee) into a sure win for Democrats. In this case, the conventional wisdom is not wrong. But now I've been hearing a pitch from several Democrats involved in the Pennsylvania and Delaware races that O'Donnell could affect the Senate race in Pennsylvania, too. She's so toxic, they say, and so visible in the Philadelphia media market, that she's convincing voters Republicans are too extreme. It's a contributing factor in the tightening that appears to be happening in both the Senate and gubernatorial races. This theory has a lot of potential adherents. Democrats hope to sell it in order to keep pushing the ""Republicans are extreme"" message. Establishment Republicans irritated with O'Donnell--and Sarah Palin--want to argue that the reckless campaign might cost them more than simply the seat in Delaware. And TV producers and Web site editors like this theory because it is about Christine O'Donnell. Though she's 20 points behind in Delaware, and there are a dozen more interesting Senate races, she's good for ratings and readership. But this theory is also like those watches they sell on the street corner: shiny and thin. No one has any proof at all. How soon will the 2012 campaign start? Marc Ambinder reports that Sharron Angle's campaign is pitching this ad as the first one of the 2012 presidential campaign. It uses President Obama's words against him and ties the president to Harry Reid. As proof of the double-edged problem of an Obama visit, an image in the ad of the two men hugging (often a liability in campaigns) also appears on fliers the Reid campaign has used to turn out its vote. Reid has many problems of his own making, but one of the big ones is that for months he's been the subject of attack ads from outside groups. Will that happen to Obama in 2011? Will conservative groups with anonymous donors spend money to continue pummeling the president even after Nov. 2 and into 2011, when he can't really respond as a candidate? In 1995 Bill Clinton started putting together ads in the early summer to define his Republican opponents. Will Obama have to start putting his ads together even earlier? Are Democrats alive in Ohio? Democrats in this bellwether state may have the best get-out-the-vote effort in the country--and there are signs that it is performing well. Usually participation falls off in non-presidential years, but according to Ohio Democrats, in Cuyahoga County, a Democratic stronghold, more than 210,000 ballots have been requested to date, compared with 224,640 ballots requested in 2008. Statewide, Democrats account for 40 percent of the ballot requests. Republicans have asked for just 30 percent. Democrats appear to be mailing them in. According to numbers first reported in Politico, out of nearly 400,000 votes cast statewide through Thursday, 44 percent were from registered Democrats, 34 percent from Republicans. More Democratic ballots means more Democratic votes. But what we don't know is how the 30 percent of unaffiliated voters who asked for early ballots will vote. We also don't know whether the Republican turnout will be greater on Election Day itself. In the Senate race in Ohio, Democrats don't look like they have much of a chance. Their candidate, Lee Fisher, is behind by almost 20 points in the polls. Incumbent Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland is in a tight race, though. Turnout will be key. These numbers also matter to President Obama. The organization doing all of this work grew out of the one he created for the 2008 campaign. Ohio will be crucial to his 2012 chances. That's why, even after traveling there last week, the president will make yet another Ohio stop before the election. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter."

15	15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/the_permanent_temporary_majority.html	"According to the conventional wisdom, we've now seen three ""change"" elections in a row. The first was 2006, when Democrats wrested both the House and the Senate from Republican control. In 2008, Democrats overthrew the Republican executive. And on Tuesday, American voters elected the same Republican bums they'd just recently thrown out. (In a two-party system, there's only so much change to go around.) We've heard a lot over the years about the coming [insert party here] majority. The ur-text was  The Emerging Republican Majority, a 1969 book by Kevin Phillips that popularized the ""Southern strategy"" that got Richard Nixon elected. After 1972, Republicans predicted a broad political realignment that would keep them in power. Same in 1980. The Weekly Standard revived the claim in 2003, arguing that ""Realignment is already here, and well advanced."" The same idea manifests today in claims that America is fundamentally ""center-right""--and therefore inherently Republican. Democrats, too, have declared permanent victory. In 2002's  The Emerging Democratic Majority, John Judis and Ruy Teixeira argued that demographic trends are turning the country increasingly blue. These claims weren't crazy--they were grounded in a history of longstanding partisan majorities. Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress for the entire span between 1955 and 1994, except for a Republican control of the Senate between 1981 and 1987. After 1994, Republicans then controlled the House for a solid 12 years. The Senate flipped back and forth during that period, but mainly because of a defection and a special election, not because of wave elections. But the last few years should put predictions of permanent anything to rest. The key data point: Voters appear to have voted Democrats out for the same reasons they voted Republicans out before. And those reasons don't appear to be going away. Foremost is the bad economy. (As we constantly reiterate but never seem to process, the economy is the No. 1 factor in electoral outcomes.) Voters didn't examine Bush's economic policies and dismiss them, only to examine Obama's economic policies and dismiss them. They're just responding to hard times. As long as times stay hard, voters will punish incumbents. The economy may recover in the short term, but the need to address the long-term national debt means that future presidents and Congresses will have to make much more difficult decisions than the current leaders--and will probably be punished for it. Have we entered a new era of seesaw government, constantly switching back and forth between parties? It seems likely: The speed of the media makes voters impatient about how quickly politicians can get things done. The spike in partisanship--just look at filibuster usage over time--makes it harder for the party in power to pass legislation. Voters are therefore more likely than ever to dismiss a president as ineffectual and a Congress as ""do-nothing""--even if they've done quite a bit. What would that mean for how the parties behave? Two things, both bad. It means the party in power will be less ambitious, since it knows the opposition will misrepresent any accomplishments and a fickle public will punish them for it. (Exhibit A: Harry Reid saying he's open to trimming back parts of health care reform.) And it means the minority party will resist cooperation so as to take advantage of voters' discontent with the majority. (Exhibit B: John Boehner's speech Tuesday night, in which he declined to name concrete goals.) David Brooks argued recently that because control of the House is likely to flip back and forth, ""lasting change has to be firmly implanted and gradually absorbed."" Whatever that means, it sounds unlikely. Voters are fickle enough, and partisan divisions are stark enough, that the chances of lasting anything--except, perhaps, temporariness and contingency--seems remote. The only sure thing is that there are no sure things. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	Have we entered an era of seesaw politics?	['Reid', 'Nixon']	[]
16	16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/he_manned_up.html	"""Thank you!"" said Clark County Republican Party chairman Frank Ricotta. ""Thank you for attending the Harry Reid retirement party."" The smallish crowd that had started walking in to one of the Venetian's many, many ballrooms reacted to this as smallish crowds tend to do. They cheered, and it echoed across the eight-chandelier space, between its two bars, and across a stage where conservative radio hosts were broadcasting live from, well, the Sharron Angle victory party. In every election there is a campaign that glows with the sure confidence of success, then loses. This was not going to be one of those campaigns. It wasn't going to become one of those campaigns because Angle was the unofficial leader of the great trend of 2010. She was the ""fringe"" Republican, always written off, always bullied by the establishment, who had been adopted by a brand new political movement and stomped the establishment like a troublesome protester at a Rand Paul rally. She'd won her primary with a shoestring campaign. How could she not beat Harry Reid? A company called Political Connections was even selling a ready-made collectible tribute to the win--a framed photo of the victory party. A small palm card made the hard sell. A Historic Evening, An Amazing CollectibleANGLE WINS!Available Here Tonight! Limited Edition of 250 Dudley Winn, one of 16 Republicans from Lubbock, Texas, who came up to campaign for Angle, walked the ballroom in a shirt patterned after the flag of his state. He wore one of the night's ubiquitous Angle victory buttons, and a rainbow-patterned button that said ""Man Up, Harry Reid."" The reference to Angle's jab at the majority leader in their only televised debate was missed by no one; an inventive salesman named Victor the Snakemann was offering ""Man Up"" shirts at his Web site. Winn came to Nevada, he said, because this was really the only election he cared about. ""You have no idea what it means to Texas if Angle wins!"" he says. ""This matters more than all the other races."" The polls close in Nevada three hours after most of the polls are closed on the East Coast. Before they close, the major networks announce that Republicans are going to win the House of Representatives. There are not enough people in the room to really make an impressive noise in response to this. But the word travels fast, and there are few people still doubting that Angle, who led Reid solidly in the final polls after their debate, will win. They talk about what she can do when she wins. ""The approach should be: No more compromise,"" says Mitchell Tracy, a Republican who made a longshot bid for a seat on the Clark County commission. (It was a long enough shot that he has skipped the campaign trail to show up here a bit early.) ""Republicans always compromise. Democrats never do."" But all of this becomes moot, because Reid gets re-elected. The news is displayed on one of the ballroom's two giant screens at the exact moment that John Boehner is tearing up about the election that will make him Speaker of the House. The Republican victory bash in Nevada becomes one of the few miserable conservative fetes happening in America. Why did it happen? Bob List, an RNC committeeman who was governor of the state 30 years ago, says that it's simple. Harry Reid's campaign skills are beyond the ability of mere mortals to comprehend them. ""He really did have the best get-out-the-vote operation we've ever seen here,"" says List. ""It re-energized in the last five or seven days, whereas I think Angle peaked too early. I can't say anything she did wrong."" He thinks about this for a second. ""I suppose if I had to name something, it would be that she let Reid define her as 'crazy' in the six weeks after primary. Obviously, she isn't crazy, but obviously she never recovered."" There are other theories. An Angle volunteer named Ashkaan Koupa suggests that something went awry--illegally, maybe--because Reid had been losing in those polls. Mike Sachs suggests that Angle ""never ran a positive campaign"" and was bullied and mistreated by the Republican establishment. Winn suggests that Angle turned down the aid of ""the 600 pound gorrilla"" by refusing to hitch up her campaign, post-primary, to whoever the GOP told her told her to. But in the space of hours, there has already been a notable shift in the way that Winn talks about the race. It used to be the most important election in the country. It's now just an element of a GOP sweep. If this sounds like the self-justification of people who spent good money and hours of their time on a lousy victory party--well, it is and it isn't. It's hard to avoid the truth that they saved Reid by anointing Angle. According to exit polling, Reid won the election with a 45 percent approval rating. This is never supposed to happen. It would not have happened if Reid had not scared his best potential opponents from the field and had he not defined Angle as a kook who would wreck everything that Nevadans enjoyed. But Democrats really did fail to do that in most other races. The coming days are going to be thick with intra-Republican recriminations about what the ardor and stupidity of Tea Partiers cost them--this seat, Delaware's U.S. Senate seat, possibly the race in Colorado. And Tea Partiers did make it harder for Republicans to win a couple of seats. They did this while building intense organizations in their own states and districts. Democrats tried to fight back all year by amplifying the craziest things that the Tea Partiers or their preferred candidates said. They did what Reid did to Angle. But Reid's election operations were focused and taut, prepped for a possible loss since early 2009. Reid's victory speech plays early in the night, to a shrinking crowd. They're almost too bored to boo, until the speech starts to amuse them. ""There will still be too many foreclosure signs in too many front yards!"" says Reid, lowering expectations for his next six years in office. ""What are you doing with my money, Harry Reid?"" yells a heckler. The image is cut off, and multiple successful Republicans are trundled onstage before Angle finally concedes the race. Her speech is a tribute to the Republicans who've done better than she has and gotten to Congress. She thanks her volunteers and donors because their time wasn't wasted, nor were the 80 percent of donations she got from out of state. ""They gave like the founding fathers gave. They gave with their fortunes, their lives, and their sacred honors!"" ""Made in the USA!"" yells one fan. The crowd is small enough that she hears the comment, opens up her smile a little more, and gets back to explaining why her loss was no symptom of a lost cause.

In the last 16 years, each party has had a presidential victory and taken control of Congress in what was heralded as a realignment of American politics. Now it's happened again. House Republicans got the car keys back, to borrow Barack Obama's overused metaphor. But it wasn't a victory. The exit polls suggested the country threw them at the GOP in disgust: Here, you drive. Polls don't show much affection for the new co-leaders of American politics. According to exit polls, 41 percent of voters have an favorable view of the Republican Party, four points less than President Obama. Even Tea Party members said the GOP was on ""probation."" Yes, this was an election fueled by a bad economy, but American politics is also in a dizzying cycle. Now the debate changes. With the election over, we will now move on from the argument of how you should vote and start the argument over why you voted the way you did. The post-election debate matters because it will shape the motivations of lawmakers of both parties and the expectations of voters, who want them to do something but have no faith that they can do anything. In exit polls, almost 90 percent of voters said they were worried about the future. The House of Representatives will change from a Democratic 77-seat majority to a (smaller, but sizable) Republican majority of close to 60. The Democrats' losses were greater than the average of 36 seats during a presidency of Obama's popularity. John Boehner is now speaker of the House in a country that doesn't like his party but loves its sentiment. In exit polls, 56 percent said government is doing too many things better left to business and individuals. Nancy Pelosi will now likely find a way to gracefully exit the stage, steward of the shortest House majority since the mid-1950s. The victory in the House was broad. Republicans won in all regions of the country. The Northeastern Republican, once thought to be found only in one of Audubon's collections, is now back in New York and New Hampshire. Of the 23 Democrats elected in 2008, 16 were defeated. Meanwhile, old bulls like 13-term Rep. Paul Kanjorski of Pennsylvania, 14-term Rep. Rick Boucher of Virginia, and 17-term Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri, Democrats all, were sent home. Republicans also had a big night in the races for governor. They won in key battleground states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. The GOP won control of the statehouses in all those states (some of the 19 statehouses that flipped), which means that it will control the once-every-decade process of congressional redistricting. The only good news for Democrats was in the swing state of Colorado, where John Hickenlooper won the governor's office. If there was good news for Democrats, it was in the Senate--but it was good only relative to the grim news everywhere else. (You know you're in trouble when a loss of six seats--including the president's old seat--is the good news.) Senate Democrats retained their majority and kept their leader. Harry Reid survived. Democrat Joe Manchin won in West Virginia by running away from the president. In California, Barbara Boxer won by embracing the president. Still, Democrats lost seats. At least three of the new crop of Republican senators can thank the Tea Party. Jim DeMint took a jab at his party leader Mitch McConnell who backed Rand Paul's opponent in the GOP primary. ""I want to congratulate Rand Paul on winning a race that the leaders in his own party said he could not win,"" DeMint said in a statement. ""Rand overcame difficult odds because he consistently stood up for conservative principles."" Of course, Mitch McConnell would argue that in Delaware and Nevada Republicans could have won if the Tea Party hadn't gotten in the way. If the conservatives are going to stick to their principles, Democrats in Washington will, too. Those who are still in office in the House are more liberal and are therefore less likely to go along with the new more conservative GOP. After having watched conservatives rise in the GOP ranks by saying ""no,"" what's to keep them from not trying a little of that themselves? In broad terms, the election was a rebuke of the president. In specific geographical areas, the pain was acute. Obama's home state of Illinois elected a Republican, Mark Kirk, to fill Obama's old Senate seat. The state of Ohio essentially gave the president the finger. Obama has visited the state 12 times since his inauguration. He made his last stop before Election Day in Cleveland. Vice President Joe Biden was an honorary resident of the state, party officials joked. Democrats boasted about the turnout organization being the best in the country. After all of that, Democrats lost all five of the competitive House races in the state. They lost the Senate race. They lost the governor's race. They lost their majority in the state House of Representatives. And younger voters--who Obama and the Democrats were counting on--failed to show up, with turnout below 2008 and even 2006 levels. John Boehner didn't claim a mandate, he claimed a repudiation. ""We are witnessing a repudiation of Washington ... a repudiation of Big Government ... and a repudiation of politicians who refuse to listen to the people."" It's a good thing he didn't claim a mandate, because the message from the electorate wasn't clear. In exit polls, 37 percent said the highest priority of Congress should be ""spending to create jobs."" The nearly equal priority was reducing the budget deficit, which 37 percent said was their No. 1 goal. Repealing health care is not a priority. 48 percent want to repeal it, but almost the same number want to expand it or leave it the same. Still, it's just not at the top of their lists. 62 percent said the economy was the most important issue facing the country. Only 18 percent said that of health care. Only 39 percent of the country believes Congress should expand the Bush tax cuts for everyone, another top GOP action item. John Boehner now has the task of pushing these tricky priorities with a caucus made up of many new members who came to Washington promising to be uncompromising. Obama extended a hand immediately to Boehner. He called the presumptive speaker, and the White House released a photo with the president looking calm and easy. Today the president will have to decide whether this election was a message that signaled unhappiness with the pace of progress, or unhappiness with the direction he was taking the country. President Bill Clinton, after the disastrous Democratic performance in the 1994 midterms, said, ""I accept my share in the responsibility for the elections."" But he seemed reluctant to accept a larger verdict. By his State of the Union address, he would declare the era of big government over. Will Obama follow that path? We'll find out today at 1 p.m., when the president is scheduled to have a news conference. He can take solace in one part of the Clinton legacy, though. Two years later, after everyone had declared him dead, Clinton won re-election in a rout. Obama has to hope that the economy turns around for him the way it did for Clinton, and that the electorate does, too. He has to believe in the swing."

18	18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/youth_gone_mild.html	This article will be updated throughout Tuesday night. 11:40 p.m. One of the big assumptions the Democratic Party made this year was that President Obama could turn out the young voters who had voted for him in 2008--and there was no state in which Democrats tried harder to turn out this vote than Ohio. Nationwide, young voters did not turn out this time around. Only 11 percent of those under 30 turned out, below the 18 percent of the 2008 election and the 13 percent who turned out in 2006. In Ohio, the young vote was even more dismal. There, only 8 percent of young voters are voting. In 2006, exit polls showed that 13 percent of young voters turned out in Ohio. 11:14:Republicans have picked up seven gubernatorial seats. While it's nice that Democrats held the governor's office in New York and Massachusetts, Republicans have picked up the swing states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Only in the swing state of Colorado have Democrats won a governor's seat. This is important because, while governors don't ensure a presidential candidate will win that state, it does give them a leg up. A ready-made organization allows a candidate to spend resources elsewhere. Those victories will matter after 2012 as well, particularly because Republicans are doing very well at the state level. In 11 states, control of the statehouse has flipped from Democrat to Republican. In Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Texas, the GOP now controls the branches that deal with redistricting. In Ohio, the House has turned Republican, which puts even more pressure on Democrats to win the governor's race. The same is true for Florida. If Democrat Alex Sink doesn't win, that will make another state in which the GOP will control the entire redistricting process. 8:59: So far the best news of the night for Democrats comes from the candidate who tried to run away from President Obama. In West Virginia's Senate race, Gov. Joe Manchin is the projected winner. According to exit polls, 62 percent of coal industry households voted for Manchin. The southern-border counties of Logan, Mingo, and Raleigh, where Manchin had to do well, are coal country. John Raese, the Republican, was going to try to take votes away from Manchin there. Raese wanted this to be a campaign about change. Manchin tried to paint him as an outsider. Manchin won that battle. More people based their vote on the terms of the debate as he defined it. Exit polls show that 40 percent of the voters said what mattered most was that the candidate understands the needs of people like me. Manchin won that group 60 percent to 37 percent. Raese did even better among those who wanted change--but only 31 percent of voters picked that as their main criteria. Some other early thoughts from the exit polls: *Democrats are getting killed with white voters. In 2006, Democrats lost the white vote by 4 percentage points. In exit polls tonight, Democrats are losing white voters by 60 percent to 38 percent. *The president was on people's minds. In 1994, 51 percent of the population said that President Bill Clinton wasn't a factor. This year, only 36 percent said Obama was not a factor. Of those, 24 percent said it was support for Obama that was a factor, while 37 percent said it was opposition to Obama. *Who is to blame for the economy? Wall Street Bankers (34 percent), George Bush (29 percent), and Barack Obama (24 percent). *In Virginia, we were looking to see if the Republican wave would take vulnerable Rep. Tom Perriello of the 5th District and stop there, or would it also get Rep. Gerald Connolly in the 11th District. Perriello has gone down, as has Rep. Rick Boucher in the 9th District, and as of 8:30 p.m., Connolly is fighting for his life. That's a preliminary indication that this wave could grow. *Late in the Kentucky Senate campaign, Democrat Jack Conway threw a Hail Mary pass: He ran an ad trying to raise questions about Rand Paul in order to scare religious voters. It didn't appear to work. Half of the voters in the state identified themselves as evangelicals, and they overwhelmingly went for Paul, 70 percent to 30 percent. *In Indiana's 9th District, Republican challenger Todd Young has defeated Democratic incumbent Baron Hill. It was a race Republicans  should have won, but it neverthless represents a GOP gain. In the state's 2nd District, however, the firewall held: Rep. Joe Donnelly, a Democrat,  won another term. *In Pennsylvania, the House went to the Republicans, as did the governorship. That will be a boon to the party when it comes time for redistricing next year. It has total control over the state, and therefore the redistricting process--and Pennsylvania is a crucial battleground state.

19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/precriminations.html	"Victory has a thousand fathers, but defeat is an orphan. Unless you're talking about the 2010 elections, in which case the list of scapegoats for likely Democratic losses is long and growing. With only hours to go until polls close on Election Day, prognosticators have settled on their forecasts: Most agree that Republicans will gain at least 50 seats in the House--enough to win the majority--and about seven seats in the Senate. Whom to blame? The complete list of scapegoats will not be available until after the election. But it never hurts to get a head start. Here are some of the people, institutions, and political phenomena Democrats are likely to blame: Barack Obama. The president swept into office promising to pass monumental legislation that would transform our health care system and fix Wall Street. Unfortunately for some Democrats, he succeeded. When asked what makes them want to vote against sitting incumbents, most voters cite health care reform, according to polling commissioned by the National Republican Congressional Committee. Had Obama first pushed more popular legislation like job creation--instead of waiting until March 2010--Democrats would be OK, the thinking goes. (Never mind that job creation was the whole point of the stimulus package.) And whatever the merits of health care reform and Wall Street reform, Obama failed to articulate them. Instead, he ceded that territory to ... Republicans. They called Obama ""socialist."" They indulged in the ""death panels"" myth. They obstructed bills without providing plausible alternatives. And it worked. Whatever you think of the GOP's governing philosophy, their electoral strategy--attacking Obama's policies as government overreach of historic proportions--was airtight. Democrats labeled them the ""Party of No."" It turns out ""No"" is an effective rebuttal. Max Baucus. Health care might not have happened without Sen. Max Baucus of Montana. Then again, it might have happened a lot faster. Over the course of four months in 2009, Baucus made one compromise after another--scrapping the public option, killing the employer mandate--in order to attract Republican votes that never materialized. That gave Republicans time to demagogue the bill and ate up valuable time on the congressional calendar--time that could have been used to pass legislation like immigration reform or an energy bill (which, of course, would probably have hurt Democrats, too). Chris Van Hollen. It's a tough job, sure. But there's no way the man in charge of re-electing Democratic House members doesn't escape unscathed. Van Hollen, who represents Maryland's Washington suburbs, appears to have done everything he could, urging Democrats to vote against party leadership when it helped their re-election chances and raising twice as much money as his Republican counterpart earlier this year. (Republicans eventually caught up.) This year, everything was not enough. Nancy Pelosi. The speaker of the House did an incredible job getting Democrats to take a tough vote on a climate change bill. Unfortunately, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid did not, leaving the House Democrats who supported it with a damaging vote but nothing to show for it. The Supreme Court. With a series of decisions culminating in Citizens United in January 2010, the Supreme Court opened the doors to unlimited independent expenditures in elections by unions, corporations, and individuals. Since then, Republican-leaning interest groups have been outspending Democratic-leaning groups by a factor of 2-to-1. (There's a chicken-and-egg problem, though, since the spending disparity may be caused by greater Republican enthusiasm.) Democrats also argue that the court's decisions led to the rise of front groups like Karl Rove's American Crossroads, which allow corporations to spend money anonymously. (Again, it's more complicated than that.) The Economy. The simplest explanation is usually the correct one. A bad economy hurts incumbents. In fact, there's a strong correlation between economic indicators and votes. You could argue that Democrats shot themselves in the foot by making the stimulus package too small. But they were probably doomed either way. The Cycle. The president's party almost always loses seats during midterm elections. There are some exceptions, notably Democrats during the Depression in 1934 and Republicans in the aftermath of 9/11. But still, since 1862, the president's party has lost an average of 32 House seats and two Senate seats in off-year elections. In politics, that's the price of doing business. The Voters. Job losses, a rising deficit, and frustration with the tone in Washington got Obama elected in 2008. Two years later, the same forces will push Democrats out. The ultimate culprit for Democratic losses may be voter impatience. Many voters don't seem to know what they want: They want smaller government, but they don't want cuts to Medicare. They want tax cuts, but also want to balance the budget. They want more political cooperation, but they reward House Republicans for casting not a single vote for the stimulus package or health care reform. And voters who do know what they want want it immediately. ""When we promised during the campaign change you can believe in, it wasn't change you can believe in in 18 months,"" Obama told Jon Stewart last week. Maybe he should have been more specific.

20	20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/11/how_bad_can_it_get.html	"Just how badly are the Democrats about to lose this election? Yes, the likes of Tim Kaine, Joe Biden, and other men with horrible jobs are still promising that their party can win. But no one else is buying it. Charlie Cook predicts that the party will lose 50 to 60 House seats, and if he's wrong the number will head higher. Nate Silver gives the GOP about an 85-90 percent chance of winning the House. There are many good reasons to buy the doom, and few reasons to disbelieve it. A year ago, Democrats had an inauspicious off-year election, losing the governors' mansions in New Jersey and Virginia and key county offices in New York. At the time, the generic ballot test found them roughly tied with Republicans nationwide. They're not tied any more. And the abiding Democratic mood is doom. Politico's Alex Isenstadt has captured the conventional wisdom of party consultants, some of them named and some of them not, who assume that they're going to lose the House and add, in the words of one scaredy-cat, ""Everybody that is tied will lose, and everyone that is ahead by a few points will lose."" But there's a difference between a Democratic loss and a historic Democratic meltdown. And there will be different kinds of spin from the ruling party depending on exactly how the party loses. Here, based on conversations with Democratic strategists, is some post-election spin--one day early! Losing, Barely: When Democrats want to prove that 2010 is still survivable, they reach back to the 2009 and 2010 special elections and mine them for fairy dust. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee won every competitive special election for the House, save for a fluke in Hawaii, where two Democrats split the vote and allowed Rep. Charles Djou to slip into office on a plurality. The two model races--they hope--happened in New York's 23rd District and Pennsylvania's 12th. In New York, Democrat Bill Owens eked out a victory over conservative candidate Doug Hoffman after Republican candidate Dede Scozzafava angrily quit the race and endorsed Owens. (She'd been effectively hounded out by national conservatives up to and including Sarah Palin.) In the Pennsylvania race, the late John Murtha's district director Mark Critz powered out a decisive eight-point victory--bigger than the polls had predicted--with a muscular, union-driven get-out-the-vote program and a relentless campaign accusing Republican Tim Burns of backing outsourcing and a national sales tax. Democrats want to repeat those results again and again and again. And they're trying. In many districts where Tea Partiers or Libertarians are running to the GOP's right, they're paying for ads in the hope that the other side will split its vote. In the 28 states that don't have right-to-work laws, Democrats are hopeful that their union-based field organization overcomes the Tea Party's newer, less tested operation. And they're running anti-outsourcing and anti-sales tax ads wherever they can, doubling down in more liberal districts by hitting Republicans on abortion rights. If this works--and it's by far the least likely scenario--Democrats could limit their seat losses in the House to the mid-40s and hold the Senate beyond the margin of Lieberman while keeping out Alaska's Joe Miller and Nevada's Sharron Angle. That would put them ahead of where they were in 1995--something true of most election scenarios, incidentally--and give incoming House Speaker John Boehner (we can say that now, right?) a working majority that would still be reversible in 2012. And in this scenario Democrats offset their gubernatorial losses in Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, and a swath of red states with wins in California and Florida. As Bad As They Thought: What if the polls are right? Democrats lose big--bigger than they thought was possible a month ago. As their Senate firewalls hold in Delaware, Connecticut, and California, they lose every other race that it was possible to lose. Patty Murray goes down in Washington. Rand Paul curb-stomps--figuratively speaking, of course--Jack Conway in Kentucky, pulling in a Republican member of Congress in one of the state's two Democratic districts. Sharron Angle heads to the Senate from Nevada. The Republican wave reels in more than 60 members of the House, some of them from districts where Obama got 60 percent of the vote. Democrats hold the Senate, but only by one or two seats. They lose to Rick Scott--Rick Scott! The bald supervillain who killed the public option!--in the governor's race in Florida, and the redistricting picture looks worse in other states as their numbers drop in state legislatures. There are a few bright spots for the party. California stays blue, and everyone has a hearty laugh at Meg Whitman, outbid on the governorship. There are a few surprises: Perhaps Ben Quayle loses the open race for a safe seat in Arizona, or Annie Kuster wins the precarious 2nd District of New Hampshire. There are some races for Democrats to analyze and re-analyze for signs of how to rebuild, the way that they studied the Colorado Democratic surge in 2004. There are some rising stars who get profiled by the media, because the media needs to profile somebody. The last time this happened, some guy named Barack Obama got onto the cover of Newsweek with the headline ""Seeing Purple."" Some version of this scenario is what most Democrats now expect. It's the scenario the party's Cassandras are most ready to spin. ""The Democrats who are going to survive are not going to be 'green shoots,' "" says New York-based Democratic operative Dan Gerstein, who has been warning of Democratic peril since early 2009. But the search for signs of Democratic life in this scenario has already begun, and it's getting on his nerves. ""Democrats can win in California, so they're surviving? That's bullshit spin,"" says Gerstein. ""You're hearing excuse-making and rationalizing when independents are screaming 'It's not working! You didn't deliver the results!' "" The Nightmare. Every toss-up goes to the Republicans. Some races that no one paid much attention too--little windy gerrymanders in New York and California and Illinois--go to Republicans who were never supposed to come close, and never had before. Some of the old bulls of the House who never looked truly vulnerable, like Missouri's Ike Skelton and Washington's Norm Dicks, lose their seats to candidates whom Democrats had considered too flawed or fringe to take advantage of the trends. The GOP picks up as many as 1,000 state legislative seats, and governorships they were never supposed to win. And they take the Senate. This is the scenario elegantly imagined by Nate Silver in a Sunday blog post. How do the Democrats recover from this? For a while, they don't. That AP-KN poll that found 47 percent of Democrats hankering for a primary challenge is answered by more polls trying to stoke a Hillary Clinton campaign for 2012. (This has begun already: Rush Limbaugh has proclaimed a ""Reverse Operation Chaos,"" in which election losses will be blamed on ""Hillary voters"" staying home to soften up Obama.) Depending on how many Blue Dog Democrats survive, the Republican House can get awfully close to overriding presidential vetoes. And the nightmare scenario drops some time bombs that Democrats aren't seeing yet. In a pure wave election, voters generally pull the lever for the winning party all the way down the ballot, in the races they know less about. This is one reason why Virginia's Ken Cuccinelli easily won the 2009 race for attorney general despite editorial boards warning about his conservative activism. And this is why many budding Democratic stars-- California attorney general candidate Kamala Harris, New York attorney general candidate Eric Schneiderman, Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray--could go down. Few people have paid much attention to the Republicans who would replace them, or what they would do. Cuccinelli has the answer: A new class of Republican attorneys general can take dead aim at the Obama administration's federal mandates, and a new class of Republican secretaries of state can raise the barriers to voting and voting registration, challenging early voting and same-day registration reforms that have been good for Democrats. In other words, are Democrats about to lose one election? Or are they about to lose elections for years to come? Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/sane_clown_posse.html	"Everyone was wondering what kind of rally Jon Stewart would hold. Would it be a comedy routine, interchangeable with an episode of The Daily Show? Or would it make a serious political statement that could, according to some analysts, undermine Stewart and Stephen Colbert as comedians willing to mock both sides equally? It was both. The Rally To Restore Sanity and/or Fear, held on the National Mall Saturday afternoon, ridiculed the whole idea of a political rally. But it also managed to send a message about the broken political system, how the media abets it, and why it's OK to care--even for professional ironists. Turns out the political rally is a ripe form for satire. And while not all the jokes hit, Saturday's show was faithful to the format, down to a ""Benediction,"" a lame poetry reading, and cheesy musical numbers. (""The Star Spangled Banner"" went wisely unmocked.) Tim Meadows guested as a shyster trying to hawk janky rally memorabilia. Stewart and Colbert handed out awards for calmness and fear-mongering, respectively. They even took on media coverage of rallies. ""There are two options for reporting on a rally,"" Stewart said. ""It was either a tremendous success or horrendous failure."" Cut to Daily Show correspondent Wyatt Cenac filing a jingoistic snow job that celebrated real Americans coming together while Jason Jones delivered a paranoid hit piece underplaying attendance. Stewart thus managed to mock the very media tropes that could be used to cover his own rally. Stewart has always walked the line between irony and sincerity. He's a jokester, but he cares about political discourse, if not the minutiae of policymaking. The rally was a three-hour exploration of that tension. Every time the tone threatened to get mawkish, a gag swooped in to undercut it.  Just as the eyeballs started the roll as the artist formerly known as Cat Stevens sang ""Peace Train,"" Ozzy * Osbourne intervened with ""Crazy Train."" Jon Stewart was just starting to give a somber ""keynote"" speech when Colbert cut him off. Only at the end did Stewart take off the clown nose entirely. (He affixed a warning label, calling it a ""moment for some sincerity."") He admitted not knowing what exactly the rally was about. ""Some of you see it as a clarion call for action. Some of you more ironic cats see it as a 'clarion call' for 'action.' "" He could only speak to his own intent, he said, which was to show that civil discourse and cooperation are possible. ""We work together to get things done every day,"" he said. Most people are not political animals--they ""don't live solely as Democrats or Republicans or liberals or conservatives. Most of them [are] just a little late for something they have to do."" Likewise, things are not as bad as they seem. ""We live in hard times, not End Times."" But you wouldn't know it from the way the media portrays politics. ""The perpetual pundit conflicterator did not cause our problems, but its existence makes solving them that much harder."" Individuals may not physically be able to restrain Glenn Beck from going to work. But they can change the channel, Stewart said. As for fixing the political process, he compared problem solving with cars merging lanes to squeeze through a tunnel. ""They do it, concession by concession. ... There will be days of darkness. And sometimes the light at the end of the tunnel isn't the promised land. Sometimes it's New Jersey."" The rally's open-ended mission statement meant that each person brought his own interpretation--which, come to think of it, is how the Tea Party works. Some people took the ""rally against rallies"" angle. Signs mocking signs were everywhere: ""Having a Sign Makes Me Right,"" ""I hope today isn't too windy so my sign doesn't blow away,"" ""My Political Views Can't Be Summarized by a Sign."" Chris Ellis,  26, carried a sign saying, ""Meh!"" As a ""raging apathetic,"" his goal was to protest protests. ""If you really want to get things done, you don't go to a rally,"" said his friend, Kevin Guertler. ""You go get a job. You go start a social group. You don't hold a sign."" They feel so strongly about not holding signs, they drove all the way from Raleigh and Richmond, respectively, to hold signs about it. * Others were motivated by disgust with the Tea Parties. ""Yeah, Right, Like Jesus Would Have Been in Your Tea Party,"" read a sign carried by Terry Holliday, 33, of West Virginia. ""I want people to know that the Tea Party are not the only patriotic people in the country,"" he said. Other attendees were just Daily Show superfans. ""It ain't no joke!"" said Ralph Childers, a man of a certain age who, along with his friend Barbara Sarah, was toting a ""Bubbies 4 Sanity"" sign. Childers says he gets his news from Stewart and Colbert. ""Everybody else is crazy."" And the sincerity bit? Holliday says that was his favorite part. ""Every comedian has a serious side,"" he said. ""I don't believe it was a play for ratings. He sees a divide and wants to fix it."" ""The only thing I thought was missing was I thought he should have said you should vote,"" said Fred Edwords of Maryland. ""I think it's a civic duty. Why should he shy away from it?"" Stewart's plea to change the channel didn't satisfy everyone, either. ""I already don't watch 24 hour news,"" said Mallory Hatton, 25, of Texas. ""I don't do any of that stuff."" But for a few hours on Saturday, at least, civility reigned. When a girl near me started a chant--""Fuck Glenn Beck!""--a guy nearby shushed her and suggested an alternative: ""Glenn Beck has different opinions than me!""

23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/a_new_angle.html	"Each Friday before the election, I have posted some of the questions I'm trying to answer based on news of the week or something that's come up in my reporting. This is the last entry. Thanks for reading. Feel free to weigh in with answers--or with more political questions--at  slatepolitics@gmail.com  or in the comments section below. Here are this week's questions: Can Obama really eat his spinach? If Republicans take control of the House, very little is going to happen in Washington unless there's a decline in the distrust between President Obama and the leaders of the Republican Party. Both sides believe the other acted in bad faith from the start. According to House Minority Leader John Boehner, some of his private interactions with the president have gotten testy. ""He looked at me and he slapped the table and said, 'Boehner, it's not my policies that are paralyzing these employers. It's you Republicans who are scaring them.' "" One way relations might improve would be through some personal interaction. Boehner is a clubby guy. He's a long-serving legislator. He might reach out to the president. But will Obama reach back? The president welcomed Republicans early in his administration. He even had GOP leaders over to the White House for drinks. He also paid a public visit to the GOP caucus during the health care fight, and put in a strong performance. But when it comes to potentially difficult one-on-one interactions, the president isn't always eager to engage. He didn't meet face-to-face with Gen. Stanley McChrystal for months after naming him his top commander in Afghanistan. He waited 18 months to meet one-on-one with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. He didn't call Tony Hayward, the former BP CEO, during the oil spill. In March, he treated his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu like a root canal. Does Mitch want Sharron? In a return to tradition broken by former Senate Republican Leader Bill Frist against Majority Leader Tom Daschle, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has not campaigned against his counterpart, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. But presumably, McConnell would prefer to increase the size of his caucus, which means he'd like Sharron Angle to win in the Nevada Senate race. But are we sure about that? McConnell has a working relationship with Reid. (Indeed, Reid says they are friends, though that can mean a wide variety of things in the Senate.) Whoever replaces Reid may be more difficult to deal with--especially if it's the combative Chuck Schumer of New York. Reid's defeat would bring in Sharron Angle, who is unpredictable. One of her signature campaign promises is that she won't go to Washington and embrace the establishment. Alternatively, she has boasted that she'll go to Washington and be able to make demands on McConnell. Mr. Minority Leader, it's the gentlelady from Nevada on Line Two. Again. Angle also grows the DeMint caucus, that group of conservative Republican senators, acolytes of Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina, least inclined to listen to their leader when he makes the case for compromise. Nonsense, say GOP Senate sources. McConnell would take Angle in a heartbeat. Here's why: Schumer or Dick Durbin, the Illinois Democrat who would also be a strong candidate to replace Reid, allow him to make a stronger ideological contrast than with Reid. The DeMint caucus may get larger, but so will the less combative Republican caucus, which will likely include new members Blunt, Portman, Hoeven, Coats, Kirk, and Ayotte. Should Democrats have attacked the Tea Party more? For months, Democrats have tried to make specific Tea Party candidates like Rand Paul and Sharron Angle stand in for the entire Republican Party. Should they have done more to define and attack the Tea Party itself more thoroughly? At a meeting with reporters sponsored by the centrist Democratic group Third Way Pollster Pete Brodnitz made the case that the Tea Party helped the GOP by allowing the Republican Party to shed its past. People no longer thought of it as the party that had been in control of the White House when the financial crisis happened. They thought of it as a new entity built by the grass roots. ""They took off their ties and they were a new party,"" said Brodnitz. Some Democrats argue that this is why Democrats should have worked harder to show that the Tea Party is the same group that caused the economic problems about which they are now so unhappy. But voters are motivated more by a dislike of incumbents, many of whom are Democrats. Members of the party in power are the ones who needed to lose the necktie or find some kind of costume to make voters forget who they are. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook.

But when it comes time to decorate their offices, the theme is often ""I am so not you!"" Stroll through any senator's office and you'll find scores of mini museums doubling as waiting rooms. The content of their exhibits varies widely, ranging from historical artifacts and sports memorabilia to expansive ego walls dedicated only to themselves. There's nothing wrong with being proud of a career achievement or showing off the time you met a celebrity at a charity golf tournament. But when do a few photos or plaques transmogrify into a self-aggrandizing shrine? Where is the line between modest pride and out-of-control egomania? In a quest to find out, we developed the Senate Vanity Index, a formula that measures the level of egotism displayed in each senator's lobby, the part of his or her office open to the public. (Here's a look at the math--really!--behind our formula. And here's the raw data, in convenient spreadsheet form.) Visiting all 100 offices, we counted every award and picture on the walls--giving special weight to each senator's poses with celebrities, presidents, and foreign dignitaries. We make no claims that our vanity formula is flawless. But we do feel comfortable declaring that we have found a truly bipartisan issue: Of the top 10 egos in our rankings, five are Republicans, four are Democrats, and one is an independent who caucuses with the Democrats. Six of those top 10 have run for president, but four are leaving office, meaning that some of the Senate's most spectacular ego walls will soon be dismantled. Fortunately, we have captured them for posterity--as well as several more exhibitions of senatorial splendor.

25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/mexijuana.html	"The American war on marijuana has a villain problem in California. After 14 years of legalized medical cannabis, which has had the unintended consequence of turning nearly every news article about pot into an opportunity for light humor, the face of the drug's trade has softened considerably. The only real public menace left in the state's pot economy--the last scourge worthy of old-school drug-war tactics like helicopter drops and raiding parties--comes in the form of Mexican ""cartels,"" the crime syndicates that grow pot deep inside California's public lands and sow hellish violence and mayhem south of the border. Now the dreaded cartels are at the center of the debate over Proposition 19, next Tuesday's historic referendum on whether California should legalize marijuana as an adult recreational drug. Advocates say that ending prohibition would be the most effective way to beat the Mexican drug rings. A legal marijuana industry, they argue, would undercut the crime syndicates on price and quality and cripple their business. Opponents of Proposition 19, meanwhile, point to the cartels as the true, inevitable face of the drug trade, arguing that the syndicates will only change their tactics and become more violent if the ballot initiative passes. Either way, the debate over legalization sounds eerily familiar. Indeed, as the drug war recedes in California, it appears to be returning to its roots. Like the Tax, Control, and Regulate Cannabis Act of 2010, the earliest moves to outlaw cannabis took place at the state level--in California, no less. And like today's movement for legalization, the push to ban marijuana revolved around fears of Mexicans. The idea of prohibition first took hold around the time of the 1910 Mexican Revolution, which drove waves of poor immigrants north into the Western United States. Along with their willingness to pick beets and cotton for pitifully low wages, the newcomers brought a penchant for smoking a peculiar sort of cigarette. At the time, cannabis was virtually unknown as an intoxicant among the Anglo-American population, writes Dale Gieringer, the California state director of the National Campaign for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. Aside from a few accounts of hash houses in New York and travelers who had visited the hashish-loving regions of the Middle East, there is next to no record of pot's recreational use in America before the 20th century. Criminalizing marijuana, then, was a way of criminalizing Mexicans: a kind of stoner's Jim Crow. And state lawmakers who favored the policy weren't exactly shy about their agenda. ""All Mexicans are crazy,"" said one Texas legislator during the floor debate over marijuana criminalization in his state, ""and this stuff is what makes them crazy."" Or as an advocate of Montana's first anti-marijuana law said in his state legislature: ""Give one of these Mexican beet field workers a couple of puffs on a marijuana cigarette and he thinks he is in the bullring at Barcelona."" California's 1913 law against pot--one of the first such statutes in the nation--banned ""preparations of hemp, or loco-weed."" Prohibition of marijuana finally went federal in 1937. In a little-remarked, exceedingly brief congressional hearing held to discuss the proposed Marihuana Tax Act, Federal Bureau of Narcotics Director Harry Anslinger--who once said that ""the primary reason to outlaw marijuana is its effect on the degenerate races""--testified that marijuana caused in its users ""insanity, criminality, and death."" As the late historian Charles Whitebread recounts, that official testimony enjoyed a strange afterlife over the next few years, as a series of defendants in sensational murder trials walked off with insanity pleas, claiming they had done their vile deeds under the influence of the obscure drug ""marihuana."" Moral panic ensued--as did the drug's prevalence as something other than a trick legal defense. ""Ironically,"" writes Gieringer, ""it was only after marijuana had been outlawed that it began to become popular."" Before long, Americans' taste for marijuana far exceeded that of their neighbors to the south. Today, only 3 million Mexicans say they smoke pot. By contrast, 25.8 million Americans say they have done so within the past year, most of them members of the Anglo-American majority. (On the list of Stuff White People Like, marijuana is No. 33, behind microbreweries but ahead of TheDaily Show.) And yet Mexico has always managed to play a major role in America's relationship with weed, just as Latinos have always managed to bear more than their share of the drug war's aggression. For years, Mexico was the dominant source for all pot smoked in the United States. Then in 1975, the Mexican government, using equipment donated by American drug warriors, sprayed the marijuana fields of the Sierra Madre Mountains with Paraquat, an herbicide deadly to humans. Contaminated pot entered the American supply, which made Mexican dope about as popular as English beef was during Britain's 2001 outbreak of hoof-and-mouth disease. This helped establish the hippie stronghold of Northern California as the new capital of marijuana production, which in turn encouraged the Mexican cartels to get out of the smuggling game and relocate their gardens to Humboldt and Mendocino. Today, vast Mexican ""guerilla grows"" colonize the inner reaches of California's state and national forests, supplying the low end of the marijuana market. This summer in Northern California, amid all the heady talk of legalization, incidents of violence on public lands between police and guerilla growers reached the highest levels in recent memory. Five growers, all Latinos, were shot and killed by law enforcement officials. But whether these casualties were foot soldiers of the Sinaloa Cartelor simply hired hands working for an American employer is nearly impossible to tell. Because cartels operate somewhat like terror cells (or labor-trafficking rings), even the guerilla growers who fall under arrest often have no idea who their real employers might be. In fact, many Northern California locals who grow marijuana say they don't believeall the reports of Mexican cartels deep in the woods: They argue that, more often than not, references to the syndicates are just police hype and overdiagnosis--propaganda meant to keep the marijuana business as scary as possible in the waning days of prohibition. (In an age of stoned-senior-citizen bingo nights, every bogeyman helps.) Of course, people in the border regions of Mexico don't have the luxury of entertaining doubts about the cartels' reach. There, the crime syndicates could hardly be scarier, with a death toll that has reached 28,000 since 2006.  Last week, after the Mexican government seized and destroyed 134 metric tons of marijuana, 27 people were killed in Tijuana and Juarez in apparent retaliation. * Earlier this month, during a conference to promote investment in Tijuana, two headless bodies were found hanging from a bridge a few miles away. The most heartbreaking calls for legalization come from within Mexico itself, where the evils of prohibition have exacted the largest human toll. At the same time, it's important to realize that the campaign for Proposition 19 is, in part, a fight for control over a hugely lucrative industry. The gentrified segments of the trade want to seize control over the industry from its criminal segments, which frequently happen to have both Mexican labor and Mexican management. As I have written elsewhere, if Proposition 19--or some successor legislation in 2012--should pass, the marijuana industry stands to grow, prosper, and consolidate. But in the process, it will probably end up trading one form of illegality for another. We could see big pot operations open up in the Central Valley, and the once-outlaw hippies of Mendocino and Humboldt catering to busloads of Japanese tourists with a Napa Valley of marijuana. But in a world of tighter profit margins and higher taxes for growers, the laborers tending these crops will likely be the same people who work virtually every other field in California agriculture: undocumented laborers from the land of Acapulco Gold.Like Slate on  Facebook.

26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/fake_the_vote.html	"Another election, another round of voter fraud allegations. Republicans and Democrats--also known as the voter-fraud police and the voter-fraud-police police--are already manning their stations. David Norcross, chairman of the Republican National Lawyers Association, says that attempts to commit voter fraud are under way. Michelle Malkin announced on Fox News on Monday that ""we are all voter-fraud police now."" Dick Armey, chairman of FreedomWorks, attributed the Democratic lead among early ballot voters to the fact that there's ""less ballot security"" in areas where Democratic voters dominate. In response, Tea Party groups and other organizations on the right are recruiting poll monitors to make sure no shenanigans take place. A Tea Party group in St. Paul has even offered a $500 reward for information that leads to a successful prosecution for voter fraud. In Milwaukee, billboards show people behind bars with the caption, ""We Voted Illegally."" Liberals, meanwhile, warn that conservative attempts to monitor the polls will intimidate voters and suppress turnout. No one denies that ginning up fear about systematic voter fraud is an effective political tactic. It appeals to an electorate suspicious of government and helps delegitimize any victories that can be attributed to the overenfranchisement of minorities, i.e. Democratic voters. But no one should believe that voter fraud is a widespread problem. In 2002, the Bush administration made cracking down on voter fraud a top priority. Five years later, the effort had yielded 86 convictions. About 30 convictions were linked to vote-buying schemes in races for small offices like sheriff or judge. Only 26 were attributable to individual voters, and most of those were misunderstandings about voter eligibility, such as felons who voted without knowing it was illegal. The prosecutions provided little evidence of organized fraud. A 2007 study by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University reached a similar conclusion. The vast majority of ""fraud"" cases, it found, were due to typographical errors in poll books and registration records, bad matches between voter databases (for example, you could be listed as John Smith in one database and John T. Smith in another), and voters registering at new addresses without deleting old registrations. Much of the alleged ""voter fraud,"" it turns out, is just poorly filled out registration cards. And even if someone purposely files a fraudulent form by writing the name ""Mickey Mouse,"" it doesn't affect the election. ""Mickey Mouse doesn't vote,"" says Wendy Weiser of the Brennan Institute. Actual voter fraud--a voter pretending to be someone he's not--is, according to the study, less common than getting struck by lightning. Perhaps the strongest evidence against claims of widespread voter fraud is that it would make no sense. Imagine what you'd have to do to perpetrate such a scheme. You'd first have to recruit a large number of voters willing to cooperate, each of whom would risk five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Then you'd have to get them all registered, which would require fake IDs and mailing addresses. (The mailing address would have to be real so they could receive their registration cards.) The names and addresses would then get checked against a central state database. If the database fails to find a match, the voter's registration gets flagged for a follow-up check of their Social Security Number or driver's license number. Then on Election Day, they'd have to show their fake ID again and lie to a poll worker's face. At each point--registration, the database check, voting--they'd run the risk of getting caught. And the more people involved in the scheme, the more likely someone slips up. All it would take is one unlucky person for the whole plan to unravel. And for what? The prospect of winning a few extra votes for a candidate you support simply isn't worth the risk of jail time. (This is especially true for illegal immigrants, who want to vote even if it means risking deportation, according to some anti-fraud crusaders.) And for large organizations, there are much better, safer, more efficient ways to steal an election, such as bribing an election official or tampering with voting machines. The punishment is just as harsh, but those methods require the participation of fewer people. What's most confusing is how poll monitors would prevent fraud from occurring. Guidelines on ""what to watch for"" posted by the group Election Integrity Watch tell poll monitors to look out for buses, noncitizen voters, and voters with multiple ballots. But there's little they can do if voters simply create fake identities, which any large-scale systematic fraud would require. There's nothing wrong with preventing voter fraud, just as there's nothing wrong with preventing alien attacks. First make sure the problem is worth your time. Like Slate on  Facebook.

Because we have gathered some of the most spine-chilling Halloween footage you will ever see--all produced in an effort to influence state judicial elections. Thirty-eight states hold some form of election for their state supreme court justices, and the elections are getting ever nastier and more expensive. Whereas the spending on these races was once infinitesimal and the advertising--to the extent it existed--minimal and usually mild, that's all changing. The reasons are complicated. Judges have been targets in the culture wars, and their elections have attracted the attention of a polarized electorate. But the money behind the campaigns often comes from business, trial lawyers, and labor interests, whose bottom lines are routinely affected by state court rulings. The United States Supreme Court shares some of the blame too. Thanks to a 2002 Supreme Court ruling that removed some restraints on what judicial candidates can say in election campaigns, plus a series of Supreme Court cases culminating in this year's Citizens United case, which removed the possibility of limits on campaign spending even in judicial elections, judicial election campaigns are looking more and more like other elections: They are more expensive, more professional, and much, much scarier. And this is becoming true even in some states (such as Iowa) that merely use ""retention"" elections, in which voters just vote ""yes"" or ""no"" on whether sitting judges should remain in office for the next term. In short, these are distinctly frightening times--especially for those of us who believe judicial elections should be different from other elections and that it is important to maintain both the appearance and actuality of impartial justice. A path-breaking report by Hofstra professor James Sample, the Justice at Stake Campaign, the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, and the National Institute on Money in State Politics looking at the last decade in judicial elections reveal just how bad things have become: Between 2000 and 2009, $206.9 million was spent on judicial campaigns, more than double the amount spent in the previous decade. Special interest groups, many from outside the states where the elections are taking place, have taken to television with attack ads. And, as with campaign spending for other offices, much of this money is secret. In the midst of an already spooky campaign ad season, and wondering just how scary an attack on a dusty old moth-eaten judge could be, we went in search of some of the most negative judicial ads of this campaign, and began culling through collections of ads including those collected at the Brennan Center's Web site and the YouTube collection of the National Center for State Courts. Here are five of the scariest ads that have appeared on television, radio, or on the Internet, along with a bonus video guaranteed to send shivers down your spine: a YouTube parody following the Iowa Supreme Court justices all the way down the slippery slope after gay marriage. Help us--if you dare!--pick the creepiest ad by casting your vote below (after you watch the slide show). And be prepared to be very afraid. If judicial campaigns become just like other political campaigns, these ads will have sequels. And those sequels will be even scarier still.

28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/radical_shriek.html	"BERKELEY, Calif.--On the night before we are scheduled to address this conference, the Tea Party experts are treated to a meal at the Faculty Club. It sounds fancy, and it is, with the feel and decor of a Sundance ski lodge. Over craft beers, wine, and cheese, we discuss that favorite topic of liberal academics: What the hell happened to Barack Obama? Why does the right have all the energy that he and the left used to own? ""He got out in front of a movement that was already beginning to mobilize,"" says Hardy Frye, a professor emeritus of black studies who was an SNCC field director in Alabama and Mississippi. ""I walked precincts! I saw people voting that I hadn't seen voting in 15 years. I said, 'This is a movement, he's going to win on this issues.' And I'm not the only one disappointed."" Frye shakes his head in disbelief. ""What he needed was a job program that addressed the inner cities. It didn't even have to cost that much."" He shakes his head again. ""I think he really believes this bipartisan shit."" We sit down and we're given the full details for the conference: ""Fractures, Alliances, and Mobilizations: Emerging Analyses of the Tea Party Movement."" It's the first event of its kind hosted by Berkeley's two-year-old Center for the Comparative Study of Right-Wing Movements. The San Francisco Chronicle's Debra Saunders and I are two reporters invited to speak; everyone else is an academic, a think tanker, or a political researcher. One of the authors of the NAACP's report on ""Tea Party Nationalism"" is here, as is  Nixonland author Rick Perlstein. But the focus is going to be on the academics and the activists, on and off the stage. They want to know what the hell is going on. They are in Berkeley, where they are used to venerating left-wing activism and putting up sandbags against the once-a-decade conservative wave--Reagan (twice), Proposition 13 (about property taxes), Proposition 209 (about affirmative action), George W. Bush. The Tea Party, though? A bunch of people who reverse-engineer Saul Alinsky and yell ""Keep the government out of Medicare"" and have conservatives shouting down politicians and filling street corners? On Friday morning we file in for the conference. Just outside are giant tubs of coffee and tea, and abstracts for papers that are in progress or completed. Prospects for an American Neofascism. Initially the project would consist of a review of recent research on American right wing groups (including the Tea Party movement, the Minutemen, and the Christian right); and of trends in national and transnational political economy that bear on our subject (such as cyclical and structural economic crises, corporate/government interpenetration, and the explosive growth of the military/industrial/security complex). A Macro-Micro Model of Participation in Political Action: The Tea Party and Cognitive Biases in Information Consumption and Processing. Hypotheses were tested using qualitative data obtained from interviews with two groups: protest participants from various Tea Party protests (protesting group, N-15) and non-protesting Tea Party ""supporters"" (supporting group, N=3). Results show that strongly held pre-existing beliefs (particularly economic and political individualist ideology) heavily impacted levels of dissatisfaction with government policy and choices of information consumed. The research and analysis from the panelists is along those same lines. Why are people joining the Tea Party? Perlstein kicks off the conference with an analysis of conservative anger, tracing its history and discussing the ""sluicing"" that conservatives do to keep people angry by giving them stories that reinforce their fears. The audience, mostly academics and activists but some students, respond to quotes from Newt Gingrich and other Republicans with nervous laughter and gasps, the air-rushing-through-teeth kind that you only hear from audiences reacting to speeches. The plaintive questions start in. ""How is it that [the Tea Party has] read the Saul Alinsky handbook and progressives haven't?"" gripes one activist. ""It seems like a natural thing for progressives to take the lead here and say, look, this is in your interest. Especially when jobs and homes are being lost, that seems like a cakewalk."" ""One of the most famous things Saul Alinsky did was--when O'Hare Airport wasn't hiring African-Americans--he held the 'shit-in,' "" said Perlstein. ""They waited until the big planes were getting in then monopolized the toilets. I can't see Barack Obama doing that."" ""There is that U.S. DNA that goes all the way back and does provide the conceptual source for this lynch mob mentality,"" says Steve Martinot, who teaches at San Francisco State University. ""And that is white supremacy. Shouldn't we be looking at the Tea Party through that?"" Perlstein moves around the question. ""The thing that makes America different, and this is a very dialectical, paradoxical concept, is that we have a lot of democracy,"" he says. ""The idea that everyone has an opinion worth hearing is both the glory and the tragedy of American democracy.""* But the social scientists are more ready than the historians to crunch numbers and prove that racial animosity is key to the Tea Party. It's cold comfort for people like Hardy Frye, but it does suggest that Obama's ability to form some grand populist coalition was always limited. The University of Washington's Christopher Parker shares his research-in-progress based on interviews in seven states that break down subjects into ""true skeptics"" of the Tea Party at one end and ""true believers"" at the other. ""If you look across the board here, true skeptics of the Tea Party, 49 percent agreed with the proposition that blacks ought to work their way up without any special favors,"" says Parker. ""But if you look at the true believers, that goes to 92 percent. This is another indicator of racism, right: Over the past few years, blacks have gotten less than they deserve. Forty-five percent of true skeptics disagree with this; almost 80 percent of true believers disagree with this."" This is useful stuff for the gathered academics. Many of them are currently contemplating Tea Party research projects of their own, and a few grad students buttonhole me for advice. Some are really starting from scratch. When Saunders asks how many audience members consider themselves Tea Partiers, one hand nervously goes up; when she asks how many have attended Tea Party rallies, a bit more than a dozen hands go up. This crowd, steeped and marinated in radical politics, is struggling to understand the Tea Party. And part of their problem is that the wider world either doesn't think their analyses are novel, or derides them as slander. It's a strange place to be in. These are the people who watched Barack Obama spend a year fighting back against the charge that Bill Ayers had indoctrinated him in the ways of the Weather Underground. Then, once he came into office, they watched Obama enact an agenda that disappoints them every day but that the opposition--and sometimes the media--calls ""socialist."" When they try to label and categorize the politics of these new, conservative radicals, they convince one another but don't break through to the rest of the country. Over lunch, Charles Postel, an award-winning historian of populism and a professor at SFSU, talks about an interview he taped for a PBS program, in which he debated the Tea Party with the National Review's resident historian, Richard Brookhiser. Postel tried to explain that the more out-of-nowhere ideas of the Tea Party, such as repealing the 17th Amendment, were inspired by the John Birch Society. Brookhiser wouldn't have that. ""He blew up!"" sighs Postel. ""He was saying the Birchers haven't done anything in 40 years!"" ""They have a fully staffed office!"" laughs Chip Berlet, a well-traveled political researcher with a cane propping him up before his scheduled March 2011 knee surgery. ""They were at CPAC!"" ""It got so bad that they just didn't use that part of the tape,"" says Postel. He and Berlet move on and discuss whether the right can actually be ""populist."" Meanwhile, political anthropologist Madeline Landau shares her own theory of how the right-wing populists took over. ""The second that the major financial institutions would not loan money was in my view the critical moment,"" says Landau. ""All Obama needed to do was say to Wall Street, if you do not do this I'm going to create some regional banks."" Most of the scholars take a darker view, and provide more evidence that Obama was always going to be running uphill. Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory, presents data on the increasing partisanship of Republicans, who are more and more likely to despise Democratic presidents and deny them space to govern. ""The feeling thermometer scale goes from 0 to 100,"" says Abramowitz, pointing to a chart with a collapsing line. ""Over time, you can see that Democratic presidential candidates getting less and less. By the last time period, you can see that the average rating is around 27 degrees. That's downright freezing."" But there's a tussle here. Was Obama's downfall inevitable? Was the rise of the Tea Party? ""We need social citizenship,"" says Lisa Disch, a professor of political science and women's studies at the University of Michigan. ""We don't need Democrats kowtowing to the language of the market--although I don't think Obama is kowtowing. He believes in it."" That puts the blame on Obama, but a moment later, Disch argues that the Senate and the Republican Party used the Tea Party's anger to undercut any progressive agenda Obama might have had. ""You're not allowed to just say no to everything the president wants,"" she says, venting. ""The Tea Party movement gives them the illusion they're speaking for the majority when they aren't."" The research, the race theory, the scholarly speculation--all of this is a good start, but it doesn't soothe academics who expect the Republicans to win a bunch of elections in 10 days. While they try to understand the movement, while they pass on New Yorker articles about the Kochs and the Birchers, the movement keeps on beating them. ""I wonder if we're likely to see a Timothy McVeigh situation,"" says Nicholas Robert, an attendee originally from Australia, who basically wonders if any Tea Partiers can be arrested. ""It seems to be that we're being very polite. I wonder if there are any legal mechanisms--one that comes to mind are the provisions used to crush the Wobblies."" He gets no sympathy from the academics. ""I think that's a dangerous road to go down,"" says Berlet. Abramowitz finds me and whispers into my ear. ""In Berkeley,"" he says, ""you're seeing the other side of polarization."" Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter.

29	29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/the_good_soldier.html	"One of the reasons Democrats say 2010 won't be like 1994 is that, this year, they saw the attack coming and planned for it. ""I have said from day one this is going to be a very challenging cycle for Democrats,"" said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, who is chairman of Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Later: ""This is going to be a tough election."" Then: ""It's a tough cycle."" And again: ""It's a cycle that puts all of us to the test."" Speaking at a breakfast with reporters sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor, Van Hollen was stating the obvious. At this stage in the campaign, however, even small admissions can be hard to come by. It is still possible to find Democratic leaders trying so hard to find a silver lining that they sound like they've got their head in the clouds. On Charlie Rose Wednesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, ""Let me tell you right here and now that I would rather be in our position right now than theirs."" What she meant is that Republicans have to win maybe more than 40 seats to take control of the House, whereas Democrats only have to lose fewer than 39 to retain control. This is a novel view of casualties. As candid as Van Hollen was, there are two things he must say if he wants to have a future in politics: He must say that Democrats will keep control of Congress, and he must say that Nancy Pelosi will remain speaker if they do. It's like being in the security line at the airport: If you even hint or joke that something might go wrong, the consequences are severe. So, for example, Van Hollen could be frank enough to reveal that a lot of his fellow Democrats did not initially take this election seriously. There were ""a few [Democratic] members who we approached many, many, many months ago to get their act together who did not take that advice,"" he said. ""But he was not so forthright as to actually name any of these people. Van Hollen opened the session by delivering a dense, calorie-rich Powerbar of Democratic talking points. He hit on the legislation Congress has passed--holding Wall Street and insurance companies accountable. He mentioned the middle class, workers, special interests, secret money, Joe Barton, extremism, and outsourcing (for, for, against, against, against, against and against, respectively). He emphasized that this election is a choice--not a referendum!--and that the choice is between going forward and going backwards. It was admirably complete. But it was also long. Especially in bad times, the party in power has it harder: It has to justify what it's already done, whereas the party out of power can claim what it would have done. (Republicans can probably boil their pitch down to a word: stop). Van Hollen's central message was that, in the last two years, special interests have seen their power diminish and are fighting back by donating a flood of secret money to GOP candidates. But it may be that Democrats are delivering this message more out of necessity than by choice. They've tried to turn House Minority Leader John Boehner into a boogeyman and it hasn't really worked. They can't really tout passage of health care reform because voters have mixed views. When they rail against special interests, however, it's popular. According to a recent Wall Street Journal/NBCNews poll, 74 percent of those polled say it's a concern that outside groups have their own agenda and care only about electing or defeating candidates based on their own issues. And 71 percent say it's a concern that the candidates who are helped by these groups could be beholden to their interests. This argument also suggests to Democrats that their legislation has been effective in pinning back special interests even if people don't feel the legislation has changed their lives. Special interests wouldn't be spending so much money, the theory goes, if they weren't nervous. Strategists in tough races have been skeptical of this message, and they still are. Yes, people tell pollsters they don't want undisclosed special interest money influencing elections. But that's not what worries them when they go to bed at night, and it may not be topmost among their concerns when they head to the voting booth. When polls ask people to name their worries, special-interest money doesn't come up. (That isn't to say that by 2012 this won't be an issue. In two years, if Republicans policies are unpopular Democrats will say it's because the GOP has been paying back the special interests who bought the election for them.) In the end, it may be the key example used in the post-election recriminations, as Democrats debate whether their problem was bad communication (as various White House aides have suggested) or a bad message. Though the president has been in a reflective mood recently, discussing the modifications he may make to his presidency after the election, Van Hollen did not indicate how congressional Democrats would change if they lose control of the House on Nov. 2. When asked how things might be different, he said he hoped Republicans might be less obstructionist. It was a genuine hope, surely, but it wasn't quite a responsive answer. If this election is a referendum on what happened in the last two years, rather than a choice between competing visions for the next two--or even if it's more of a referendum than a choice--then there are signs that message has yet to sink in among some Democrats. Which means that just because the election won't be a surprise like Pearl Harbor doesn't mean it won't be a rout like the Alamo. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson on Facebook.
