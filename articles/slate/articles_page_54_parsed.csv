Now imagine that city is a place where residents suffer routine violence and cruelty at rates unlike anywhere else in the country, where they are raped and beaten with alarming frequency by their neighbors and even the city officials who are paid to keep them safe. Now imagine that we, as a nation, didn't consider the vast majority of that violence to be criminal or even worth recording. That is, in effect, the state of the U.S. correctional system today. Each year, the federal government releases two major snapshots of crime in America: The Uniform Crime Reports, written by the FBI, and the National Crime Victimization Survey, compiled by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. As part of the former, the FBI tallies a year's worth of crime as reported by police departments around the country. The latter estimates the same by surveying a sample of the American public. The two reports provide the best available data on crime in America and together are used as something of a proxy for how successful our justice system is at curbing crime around the country. According to both, America has become significantly safer over the past two decades, with today's violent crime rate nearly half of what it was at the start of the 1990s. Neither report, however, takes into account what happens inside U.S. prisons, where countless crimes go unreported and the relatively few that are recorded end up largely ignored. If we had a clearer sense of what happens behind bars, we'd likely see that we are reducing our violent crime rate, at least in part, with a statistical sleight of hand--by redefining what crime is and shifting where it happens. ""The violence is still there,"" says Lovisa Stannow, the executive director of Just Detention International, a human rights organization dedicated to ending sexual abuse and violence in prisons and jails. ""It's just been moved from our communities to our jails and prisons where it's much more hidden."" It counts as an assault when one drug dealer beats up a second on the streets of Chicago, why shouldn't it count as sexual assault when one of them is raped after he is sent to prison? It is a crime when someone beats his wife, so why shouldn't it be a crime when that same person attacks a prison guard? Technically, of course, they are crimes--only the likelihood that someone will be investigated, charged, and prosecuted for them are vanishingly small. Indeed, the assault--especially if it's between inmates--is likely to never be officially noted. The Department of Justice chooses to exclude the bulk of violence committed inside its correctional facilities from the national crime surveys. These wholesale omissions make it impossible to paint a complete picture of life behind bars in America, but there are nonetheless bits and pieces of the puzzle that we can pull together from what little is available. The FBI, for example, counts aggravated assaults, while the Bureau of Prisons tracks inmate violations for assault on fellow prisoners and guards. The BJS self-reported survey lumps rapes and sexual assaults together, but the National Inmate Survey uses a ""sexual victimization"" catchall. What might get you arrested outside of prison won't necessarily earn you a violation inside one, and vice versa. Because as much as we may want to believe that putting more people in prison has made our country a less violent one, the numbers we have suggest that that violence itself doesn't disappear, it is simply relegated to a place the public can barely see. Regardless of whether you believe that's a fair trade-off, it stands to reason that the brutality occurring behind bars deserves a fuller accounting--particularly given that we know there are innocent men and women serving sentences they don't deserve. So, again, imagine this correctional metropolis, and those to whom it is home. First the good news, which may come as a surprise: Someone living there is less likely to be murdered than they would be elsewhere in America. That, however, is where the good news ends. The bad news, of which there is plenty, is that the life he faces is so brutal that he is more likely to commit suicide than if he were free, and his chances of being raped and beaten, possibly repeatedly, appear exponentially greater. All told, there are likely at least hundreds of thousands of violent acts that occur in this city every year that could be counted as a crime if they occurred on the other side of the fence. For comparison, there were 1.2 million violent crimes reported to the FBI by police departments across the country in 2012, and a little more than 5.8 million self-reported by inmates that same year, according to the BJS survey. With the exception of fatalities--which, after all, pretty much count themselves--the Justice Department statisticians go to the greatest trouble to tally rapes and sexual assaults inside prisons, or at least they have since Congress passed the Prison Rape Elimination Act in 2003 mandating for the first time that they go through the trouble of estimating the crisis. The most recent numbers are staggering. In a 2012 survey, a full 4 percent of the nation's prisoners and 3.2 percent of jail inmates reported being sexually victimized in the previous 12 months, more than half of which said the alleged incident involved a prison guard or other staff member. When you account for inmate turnover that figure represents roughly 200,000 possible victims a year, according to BJS. Because the survey tallies victims and not incidents, an inmate who is raped repeatedly in a given year counts as a single entry. It's realistic to believe that the true number of incidents is a multiple many times that 200,000 figure. ""Rape is not part of the penalty,"" says Stannow. ""It's enormously important that we have a detailed picture of what's happening because that's the data that we need to solve the problem."" In the rest of the country, meanwhile, the self-reported total of rapes and sexual assaults in 2012 was 346,830, representing a rate of 1.3 per 1,000 people 12 years of age or older, or 0.13 percent.* While rapes have garnered the most attention since the government first began surveying inmates in 2004, it is the near-constant physical abuse--again, at the hands of both inmates and guards--that goes almost entirely unquestioned. The numbers here, too, are imperfect and somewhat dated, but a self-reported survey from 2004 found that 16 percent of state inmates said they had been injured in a fight since they began doing time. Administrative prison records offer another data point: In 2000, inmates were given 52,307 violations for assaulting fellow prisoners or guards, for a rate of 4,260 violations per 100,000 prisoners. Outside prison walls, meanwhile, the FBI tallied 911,706 aggravated assaults that same year, for a rate of 324 for every 100,000 people. The number of people incarcerated in the United States quadrupled during the past four decades before plateauing (and then slightly receding) in the past five years. The inmate population grew so fast during the boom that states were unable to build prisons fast enough to keep up: At last count, more than half of the state prison systems, as well as the federal one, were operating at or above 100-percent capacity. If we choose to continue to lock people up at a rate unparalleled in the world, we should at least be honest and acknowledge that doing so is aimed at eliminating violence from our streets, not necessarily our country. *Correction, July 1, 2014: This article originally misstated that the U.S. rate of self-reported rapes and sexual assault in 2012 was 1.3 per 100,000 people. The rate, according to the BJS, was 1.3 per 1,000 people age 12 or older. (Return.)"	The Statistical Sleight of Hand That Makes the U.S. Crime Rate Seem Lower Than It Really Is	[]	[]

First, though, the party has to figure out what it wants to say. Its leaders have the basic gist: Obama bad. It's the delivery and the details where things get a little fuzzy. Right now there are at least three competing GOP visions to Obama's world view. Sen. Rand Paul is the most articulate voice in the conservative movement for a more restrained U.S. foreign policy. On the other end of the spectrum, there is former vice president Dick Cheney, arguing for a forceful U.S. military presence in the middle of the chaotic Middle East. Between those two are those Republicans who believe in a robust American role in world affairs but recognize the practical limits of military force. This middle group has a lot of adherents but no spokesperson. If they would like to assert themselves, they better find a champion soon because right now the media, Cheney, and Paul are all conspiring to drown out their views. And unless someone can articulate a non-Dick Cheney vision of the world, Rand Paul is poised to win the conversation. In the wake of the recent turmoil in Iraq, Paul has come across as thoughtful and measured in both his op-ed in the Wall Street Journal and on Meet the Press. He is critical of the president, but also of the architects of the Iraq war. This is a good place to start if you want to begin a conversation with the American people. They are neither fans of the Iraq war, nor the president. Paul also is in sync with the national mood about foreign meddling. According to an April Pew poll, 52 percent of Americans believe that the United States should mind its own business and let other countries get along as best they can. In 2004, that number was 30 percent. Americans are also saying, by a margin of 51 percent to 17 percent, that the United States does too much rather than too little in helping solve the world's problems. Despite Republicans' recent criticism of the president, they are slightly more likely to share this view than Democrats--52 percent to 46 percent. Paul offers a stark test for intervention in Iraq--or just about anywhere--now: Is it worth sacrificing his son? ""Do I want to send one of my sons, or your son, to fight to regain Mosul?"" he asked on Meet the Press. ""These are nasty terrorists, we should want to kill them, but ... who should want to stop them more? Maybe the people who live there. Should not the Shiites, the Maliki government, should they not stand up? And, if they're ripping their uniforms off and fleeing, if they don't think Mosul is worth saving, how am I going to convince my son or your son to die for Mosul--another bad terrorist? And yes, we should prevent them from exporting terror; but, I'm not so sure where the clear-cut, American interest is."" That may be the wrong test for a foreign policy. The world may not be as simple as Paul claims and the first-term senator may be badly misrepresenting the Reagan foreign policy he claims to champion. But who will step forward to articulate that alternative worldview? Right now the alternative to Paul's vision comes from Cheney. The former vice president is raising money for a new hawkish foreign policy organization and his fundraising emails sound just like his own Wall Street Journal op-ed. President Obama is weak, says Cheney, and terrorists are going to take advantage. This blunt, Hobbesian worldview and language is indistinguishable from Cheney's posture of the past 13 years. There's nothing in his pitch for a future foreign policy that acknowledges any personal mistakes or evolution in his thinking to match a changing world. Cheney is unpopular and so are the policies he advocates. Three-fourths of the country opposes sending troops to Iraq (which Cheney supports), according to a recent CBS poll. Cheney thinks the Iraq war he helped launch was a success. According to a recent CBS poll, only 18 percent think that the Iraq war was worth it. That's the lowest that figure has ever been, though it is still higher than Cheney's approval rating when he left office, which was 13 percent. But what's more entertaining than a Dick Cheney vs. Rand Paul fight? Their differences are stark! And both are good copy and rile up readers and viewers. The fight helps both Paul and Cheney, too. Paul needs the Cheney cartoon vision of foreign policy realism to convince primary voters that they must vote for him to avoid a return of neoconservatives like the guy in the cowboy hat with the knife in his teeth. Cheney needs Paul to convince foreign policy hawks that they should listen to him because the party might flounder and wind up supporting an isolationist who will bring terrorists to our doorsteps. The country has soured on Obama's foreign policy stewardship. A plurality of 36 percent of the country thinks his policies have made America less safe, up from only 19 percent who felt that way in October 2011. For the past two years, the Republican Party has been regaining the edge on the question of which party do you trust on foreign policy, which it lost after the Bush-Cheney years. The opportunity, say those on the right who critique Obama, is a foreign policy vision that outlines a more assertive American foreign policy than the one Paul would support but one that doesn't necessarily revolve solely around military might. The conversation about this new view of power is happening in the think tank world. Former Republican officials and their policy gurus are thinking through what power means in the 21st century. But what is required--especially in a campaign against Hillary Clinton, who has an expertise in foreign affairs--is an articulate champion of views who can get past the GOP's association with the toxic Iraq war. But whoever the GOP's foreign policy wise men are, they better speak up. Because right now Dick Cheney and Rand Paul are speaking for you."	Where Did the GOP's Foreign Policy Wise Men Go?

""On Thursday morning,"" writes Ned Resnikoff for MSNBC, ""the Swedish furniture retailer IKEA announced that it would be adopting a new wage structure which is expected to increase pay for about 50 percent of its American employees."" Beginning next year, the company will link its base-level pay to the ""minimum standards of living"" in each area it is located. As a result, the average minimum hourly wage for all stores will jump to $10.59, or a 17 percent increase from the current minimum wage. What's more, notes Resnikoff, Ikea will work to comply with ""proposed minimum wage hikes across the country,"" including the $15 wage passed in Seattle and under consideration in San Francisco and Chicago. Indeed, in taking this step, Ikea joins other retailers (like Gap, Inc.) that have raised their pay or increased their benefits, likely in response to federal, state, and local pressure to increase minimum wages. With that said, it's worth noting that there's less than meets the eye to Ikea's promise to hew to local and municipal minimum wage hikes. Most Ikea stores are located in suburbs, as opposed to urban centers. The Ikea near Charlotte, North Carolina, for instance, is located on the outskirts of the area, as is the Ikea near Seattle (in Renton) and the one in Dallas (near Frisco). By virtue of geography, these stores will avoid city-mandated wage hikes. What's more, for as much as Ikea and similar stores might be good for workers, their overwhelmingly suburban locations make them isolated from large numbers of potential workers who lack employment opportunities in their own areas and neighborhoods. A few months ago, I wrote about the challenges of economic mobility in a landscape governed by residential segregation. Millions of Americans--and blacks in particular--live in neighborhoods with concentrated poverty, poor schools, high crime, and underinvestment in key public services. Compounding all of this is a huge mismatch between jobs and housing. When middle- and high-income whites left the cities for the suburbs--and then, for the exurbs--they brought a whole host of service jobs with them. Grocery stores, malls, big-box outlets, movie theaters--most are located in America's suburban and exurban areas, the defining features of our sprawling human geography. And while the proportion of blacks and Latinos living in suburban areas has rapidly increased over the last three decades, it's still true that--compared with other groups--black residential areas remain concentrated in older urban and suburban neighborhoods of our nation's metropolitan areas, away from the predominantly white outer suburbs where the majority of jobs are located. The result is that, for both groups--but low-income blacks in particular--there is a ""spatial mismatch"" between neighborhoods and employment opportunities. Put simply, the greater the sprawl of jobs in an area, the less likely it is that black residents will have easy and reliable access to them. Or, as UCLA professor Michael Stoll writes in a 2005 paper for the Brookings Institution, ""Blacks are more geographically isolated from jobs in high job-sprawl areas regardless of region, metropolitan area size, and their share of metropolitan population."" And this isn't an accident: ""Metropolitan areas characterized by higher job sprawl also exhibit more severe racial segregation between blacks and whites,"" he writes. All of this is exacerbated by our shoddy, car-centric transportation policy. To get to any job in a place like Virginia Beach, Virginia--where 10- to 15-mile drives are a fact of life--you need a car. Yes, there is a public transportation system, but it's irregular (the agency had a rate of 18 missed trips per day in March), limited in scope, and unreliable for most workers who need to be on time. But cars are expensive, and black and Latino households are much less likely to own cars than their white counterparts. What comes next is predictable: Plenty of low-income people can't find or keep jobs because they are isolated from opportunities. Which brings us back to the minimum wage. There's no question its increase will help workers in the aggregate. For example, the Democratic proposal to hike the federal minimum wage to $10.10 from $7.25 would lift 900,000 Americans out of poverty and raise incomes for the 16.5 million Americans who make less than that amount. At the same time, it's important to note the limits of the approach, namely, that higher-wage jobs don't mean much when you can't access them. It's great that Ikea and other stores are raising their base wages, but for, say, Detroit residents who can't reach the store in Canton, it doesn't mean much.* If there's an immediate solution here, it's a concerted effort to improve public transit nationwide, and push against the anti-transit policies of Tea Party groups, which have opposed mass transit projects in places like Nashville and Indianapolis. Indeed, transportation equity should be at the forefront of any liberal plan for tackling income inequality. More broadly, this underscores the critical importance of residential integration. The only way to significantly dent patterns of concentrated poverty and disadvantage in our metropolitan areas is to push policies--like land-use deregulation, housing vouchers, and relocation programs--that reduce segregation. As sociologist Mary Pattillo argues, ""more strict desegregation laws would also open the door for low-income blacks to move to predominantly white neighborhoods, where jobs and resources are unfairly clustered."" There's no improving the lives of low-income Americans without dealing with racism and its consequences for our cities and suburbs. We can raise wages and improve services, but if we can't improve transportation and mobility--if we can't break segregation--then we'll finish the battle without ever winning the war. Correction, June 27, 2014: This article originally stated that the Ikea near Detroit is located in Westland, Michigan. The store is located in Canton, a nearby area. (Return.)"

3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/06/thad_cochran_surprise_victory_over_chris_mcdaniels_political_consultants.html	"If you are a Republican political strategist, pollster, or shaman and you were thinking about buying a summer home or knocking out the wall in the kitchen to make a breakfast nook, you can go ahead. Billable hours are about to skyrocket. Sen. Thad Cochran's victory over Tea Party-backed challenger Chris McDaniels in the Republican Mississippi runoff--a rare come-from-behind win for a sitting senator--only affirmed the lesson from previous elections this primary season: If you are an incumbent, you need to be wary, attentive to your constituents, and prepared to defend yourself. Political professionals are more necessary than ever. Run scared or run unopposed. If you're looking for a grand unifying theory that ties Cochran's surprise win to the other outcomes of this Republican primary season, that's a good one. It's an ancient political cliche--you can find it on needlepoint pillows in some homes--but Cochran almost forgot it. Former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor forgot it. Sens. John Cornyn, Mitch McConnell, and Lindsey Graham, who all coasted to primary victories over their grassroots challengers, never did. They prepared for their Tea Party foes and fought back by amassing enough money, hiring the right staff (McConnell picking up Rand Paul's campaign manager), calling in air cover from friends at the Chamber of Commerce, and not straying too far from their constituents. If the message is to always run scared, then you'll need a pollster to get a temperature reading of how your constituents feel about you. You'll need a local strategist to monitor things on the ground so that your weekend visits are spent stroking the right people, and that strategist should keep an organization warm in case you need to get out the vote. If there's a consultant who can be kept happy in the nonelection years, best throw her some business--you might need her to run your super PAC for you. Cantor's pollster was way off about his race, but that just hurts his reputation. Other lawmakers will take the lesson that they need to just do more polls or hire more expensive pollsters. Cochran was a reluctant candidate, cocooned from the cut and thrust of campaigning by his temperament and long incumbency, but he had a team of local professionals that was scared for him. The Barbour brothers, Austin and Henry, have been on emergency duty for months. Austin worked inside the campaign and Henry ran the pro-Cochran super PAC. Their uncle, former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour muscled on Cochran's behalf, too. Stuart Stevens, late of the Romney campaign, also returned to his native state to lend a hand. After the blow in the June 3 primary, the team set to work contacting powerful friends outside of the state, energizing the locals, and saying lots of things suitable for a screenplay, as this reconstruction in Politico attests. The victory included a late-in-the-game political ad starring Brett Favre, the former Green Bay Packers quarterback's most effective comeback since he stopped playing football.* The team exploited scandal, celebrated Cochran's pull in Washington (rather than implausibly trying to hide it), reached out to black voters, and pumped up the Chamber of Commerce Republicans who were a little drowsy in the original primary vote three weeks ago. Turnout for the runoff was greater than for the primary, the first time that has happened in 30 years. That was not achieved by Cochran's last minute dazzling displays of charisma. This race proves that grassroots conservatives are still a strong and vibrant force. They almost knocked off a veteran senator. But this is not good news for the Tea Party. If incumbents are now more nervous than ever after the Cochran squeaker and Cantor's collapse, then it means those incumbents are going to raise even more campaign money to pay those pollsters and strategists. The fastest way to do that is to become friendly with the lobbyists and insiders who control that world. This is not just a victory for an old-time senator who grassroots activists associate with Washington's capitulating ways. It's a boost to a campaign and governing culture that they despise. Sen. Mitch McConnell has to be very happy. If the minority leader becomes majority leader after this election, he's going to face a difficult task managing a small Republican majority. He'll have to balance two things: senators up for re-election in battleground states in 2016 who will want to notch accomplishments and not alienate swing voters, and conservative agitators like Sen. Ted Cruz who will want to make names for themselves by bucking the GOP leadership. McDaniel was more likely to be in the latter camp. Cochran will largely go along with McConnell's goals. ""Senator Cochran's come from behind victory is an amazing achievement and a reminder that campaigns matter (as was true in Cantor's defeat),"" former House Speaker Newt Gingrich wrote on Twitter. When political professionals say ""campaigns matter,"" it means they are coming down a long-running debate between whether long-term trends or talented candidates and tacticians determine what voters do. In presidential campaigns, it's clear that long-term trends deserve more weight than the decisions made by frazzled strategists barking orders in the holding room at the Akron, Ohio Courtyard Marriott, but the answer is usually that both campaigns and trends matter. The problem, as one pollster once said to me, is that we don't know how much of one and how much of the other. However, for a fee, someone in a conference room or on a scratchy conference call will give you a theory. If you're in office, you'd better keep them on speed dial. Their calendar is about to get a lot more full. Correction, June 25, 2014: This article originally misspelled Brett Favre's first name. (Return.)"

4	4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/06/joe_biden_says_he_doesn_t_own_stocks_or_bonds_why_politicians_pretend_to.html	"On Monday morning, at a White House summit on policies to help working families, Vice President Joe Biden reflected on his wealth. He said that while he wore a ""mildly expensive suit"" and was vice president of the United States of America, he didn't own a stock or a bond, and as a senator, was the poorest member of the club. This bit is a longstanding part of Biden's shtick, but was interpreted--most loudly by the Republican National Committee--as a dig at possible presidential rival Hillary Clinton. The former secretary of state has been having trouble talking about her considerable wealth, ever since she described herself as ""dead broke"" upon leaving the White House. It's hard to know what motivates Biden to zoom down a rhetorical byway. His comments on Monday were particularly strange, given that the vice president's disclosure statements show that he does have a stock portfolio, though it is owned by his wife. But even if that's the case, Biden probably couldn't help himself. The poor-man routine is a political trope, the same one that tripped up Clinton on the first leg of her book-promotion tour. Politicians find it so irresistible because it can be effective. Politicians can't help trying to connect. Tell them your hometown, and they'll have a story and a relative from there. In a time of economic woe, they will try to show you that they have some connection to the most fundamental forces in a voter's world. The connection is powerful because it suggests to voters that the politician is going to work to address their problems. But candidates also try to make this connection because it's one of the vital pathways to a voter's heart. If you show voters that you have some understanding of their economic condition, they'll listen to you. Or, better yet, they'll support you without much further investigation. Voters ""fill in political characteristics from the personal,"" says Lynn Vavreck, political science professor at UCLA. ""They take an inference. They're not making it up, but they're not doing research either. They're using a lot of cues and shortcuts from their daily lives to come to a judgment."" That is why politicians kiss babies, drink boilermakers, go bowling, duck hunting, and otherwise engage in all kinds of gymnastics and pantomimes that have little to do with the office they're trying to hold. Vavreck cites the work of political scientist Samuel Popkin whose 1991 book The Reasoning Voter studied ""low-information rationality,"" the gut level way in which voters read candidates. When voters don't have much information and aren't inclined to do lots of the extra work researching the candidates, they pick information that's most available and cue off of that. That's why candidates are always mentioning that they have ""Iowa values,"" or ""Ohio values,"" says Vavreck, because ""that's a way to signal that I'm just like you."" Sometimes that's enough to make a lasting first impression. If you can show voters you understand their condition, or have experienced something similar, then you've made a potentially powerful connection. They may not know what carbon sequestration is, but their economic circumstances are vital to them. Voters who make that brief connection will be more willing to trust you as a candidate even if it's on issues that have nothing to do with the economic issues on which that connection was based. ""It's a big canister you can throw a whole bunch of stuff in,"" says Vavreck. While an economic connection can be potent, it can be easily broken. Mitt Romney talked about owning American cars--but that led to him talking about how many his wife had. He talked about liking NASCAR, but then mentioned that he knew a lot of NASCAR team owners. When President Obama picked the high price of arugula at Whole Foods as his example of the discrepancy between what supermarkets charge and what farmers get paid, he probably didn't make inroads with his audience of rural voters in Iowa which did not have the upscale chain.* Biden and Clinton are courting danger when they embroider their hard times. Dislike of phonies is a gut instinct, too. Clinton had just bought $2 million homes and signed an $8 million book contract at the time she said she was ""dead broke."" Though Biden may not be as wealthy as others in his cohort, he is obviously set for life and as a long-serving senator was always on a far easier track than a struggling middle-class family. More than Hillary, though, the vice president has known personal struggle that any hard-pressed American would recognize. His wife and child were killed in a car accident in 1972 while Christmas shopping. Fellow feeling is also not the only thing voters take into account. Liberals have long wondered why voters have put social issues above economic ones in certain parts of the country. As Vavreck points out, Rep. Paul Ryan had a compelling story of his family's struggles after his father died, but that story competes with his promotion of a budget plan that shreds social safety nets and leads even some in his party not to support it. John Edwards, Tim Pawlenty, and Rick Santorum all failed as candidates, even though they were able to connect to middle-class voters through their humble roots stories. Biden and Clinton failed too, for that matter, but since the economy is going to dominate the next election (as it always does), more stories about pocketbook struggles are inevitable. Correction, June 24, 2014: This article originally misstated that Obama was talking about high prices at the Whole Foods checkout counter.

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/06/paul_ryan_yells_at_irs_commissioner_john_koskinen_the_hypocrisy_angers_most.html	"Anyone who has ever kicked a trash can across a room after trying to get the Internal Revenue Service to explain a tax rule, or been through one of its exfoliating audits, gained a champion in Rep. Paul Ryan on Friday. At a Ways and Means Committee hearing investigating how the IRS lost thousands of emails sought by congressional investigators, the Wisconsin congressman lost it. He emptied his frustration and anger over IRS Commissioner John Koskinen like he was flushing a radiator. ""You are the Internal Revenue Service. You can reach into the lives of hard-working taxpayers and with a phone call, an email, or a letter you can turn their lives upside-down. You ask taxpayers to hang on to seven years of their personal tax information in case they are ever audited, and you can't keep six months' worth of employee emails?"" It's the IRS' business to be in our business--so Ryan is giving them the business. It's hard to think of a federal agency that is less forgiving about record keeping. If you are audited, the IRS wants you to move fast. Not only do you have to keep your records for years, as Ryan says, but the IRS wants you to move quick like a bunny. And the entire process has one subliminal message to it: ""I don't believe you."" That is exactly what Ryan said to the IRS commissioner, who took umbrage. Now he knows how it feels. It's not Commissioner Koskinen who lost the emails, he's just on the wrong side of a bad policy that doesn't require the IRS to be as records-conscious as the citizens it polices. But in the traditional IRS power relationship, it's usually the subjects of its audits who feel the unfocused and overly harsh attention of a system that assumes they are guilty. One of the big complaints I hear from voters, particularly conservative voters, is that the government exempts itself from the burdens it puts on everyday people. So members of Congress are treated differently under the Affordable Care Act than regular citizens, President Obama can decide which laws he wants to follow and which ones he doesn't, and the IRS doesn't have to be as circumspect as the rest of us. Sometimes there are good explanations, like the congressional ""exemption"" from the ACA, but since the IRS is stingy with its benefit-of-the-doubt powers, it has a high bar with the public. Democrats mocked the elaborate displays of outrage at the hearing--always a safe thing to do--but you don't have to share Ryan's view that the IRS is engaged in a cover-up of a scheme to target conservatives to recognize a more universal element to Ryan's anger. The IRS expects all of us to maintain rigid compliance, spelunk-on-demand for every receipt, and is highly skeptical of what might be garden-variety mistakes until we prove otherwise. So if the congressional system of inquiry feels a little itchy, tight, and irrational, perhaps this will be a learning opportunity or a good topic for the next pricey conference."

Other than bringing three-cornered hats, powdered wigs, and knee breeches back in style, that is. If every Republican squish in Congress were booted out of office and replaced by a doughty defender of our constitutional freedoms, what kind of laws would this purer, more authentically conservative GOP pass, and which government programs would it dismantle? If FDR gave us the New Deal and LBJ gave us the Great Society, how would President Rand Paul or President Ted Cruz seek to transform American life? No one really knows. But it is a question that comes to mind after the shocking defeat of Eric Cantor. It is not particularly likely that we'll see unified Tea Party control of the government any time soon. It is nevertheless useful to think through what a Teatopia might look like. One reason it is challenging to describe Teatopia is that Republicans who identify with the Tea Party movement are diverse in their ideological inclinations. Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., is an idiosyncratic libertarian in the Ron Paul mold, and he has never met a U.S. military intervention he's liked. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is a modernizing reformer type who wants to make government smaller and smarter, and he's a flag-waving believer in a Pax Americana foreign policy. Some Tea Party conservatives favor limiting immigration, including Dave Brat, the economist who vaulted to fame by besting Cantor. Others, including the deep-pocketed Koch brothers, believe that welcoming immigrants of all shapes, sizes, and skill levels is a bedrock principle of Americanism. If the Tea Party ever seized power, perhaps its members would, like founding fathers Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr, settle their disagreements in a series of duels. Deep divisions notwithstanding, there are a number of principles that unite the movement. The most important of them is a devotion to subsidiarity, which holds that power should rest as close to ordinary people as possible. In practice, this leads Tea Party conservatives to favor voluntary cooperation among free individuals over local government, local government over state government, and state government over the federal government. Teatopia would in some respects look much like our own America, only the contrasts would be heightened. California and New York, with their dense populations and liberal electorates, would have even bigger state governments that provide universal pre-K, a public option for health insurance, and generous funding for mass transit. They might even have their own immigration policies, which would be more welcoming toward immigrants than the policies the country as a whole would accept. More conservative states, meanwhile, would compete to go furthest and fastest in abandoning industrial-era government. Traditional urban school districts would become charter districts, in which district officials would provide limited oversight while autonomous networks of charter schools would make the decisions about how schools are run day-to-day. Parents would be given K-12 spending accounts, which could be spent on the services provided by local public schools and on a range of other educational services, from online tutoring to apprenticeships designed to provide young people with marketable skills. On transportation, Teatopia would borrow from governments in Australia and New Zealand, where roads are owned and operated by public road enterprises that make spending and investment decisions on the basis of consumer demand rather than political imperatives. Social welfare policies would be crafted with local sensibilities in mind, and they'd have a different character in communitarian Utah than they would in libertarian Texas. The goal of Tea Party federalism is not for states to serve as ""laboratories of democracy,"" in which programs that work in Houston are eventually adopted across the country by dint of federal pressure. State governments wouldn't serve as a kind of minor-league farm system for the big leagues in Washington, D.C. Rather, the goal would be for different states to offer different visions of the good life. Citizens would vote with their feet in favor of the social-democratic societies that would emerge in Vermont and the Bay Area or the laissez-faire societies that would emerge in large stretches of the Mountain West. The Tea Party movement sees this approach as the best way to honor and reflect what you might call America's normative diversity--a diversity that has less to do with ethnicity and race and more to do with the virtues that we as communities want to cultivate in our children, and that we want to see reflected in our collective institutions. Are there problems with this kind of ultra-federalism, and would it be challenging to get from here to there? Of course. Back in 1976, when Ronald Reagan challenged Gerald Ford for the GOP presidential nomination, Ford mocked Reagan for his plan to devolve large swathes of government from the federal government to the states. His main point was that even if Reagan succeeded in drastically reducing the size of the federal government and cutting federal taxes, all he'd succeed in doing is to force state governments to raise their taxes so that they could continue offering the same services. Reagan didn't have a particularly snappy response, which is a big part of why he didn't defeat Ford. To Tea Party conservatives, however, Reagan was right on the money: We should live in a country where more of our taxes go to state governments than to the federal government, as it is a heck of a lot easier to move from one state to another that better reflects our political beliefs than to move from one country to another. This is all very nice in theory. To get to Teatopia, we'd have to revisit the fact that almost all states are subject to balanced budget requirements, which are a big part of why state governments have lost ground to the federal government over the years, particularly during recessions. But remember: We're talking about the Tea Party's long-term vision, whether or not it's particularly realistic. The robust federalism of Teatopia would, in the Tea Party imagination, at least, lead to bipartisan peace in the nation's capital. Today's Era of Bad Feelings, as the National Review's Ramesh Ponnuru describes the last decade and a half of American politics, would be replaced by an Era of Good Feelings as the federal government shrinks. Crony capitalists seeking handouts and favors would be forced to decamp from D.C. to state capitals around the country, and in particular to the states that decide to maintain and expand corporate subsidies, targeted tax breaks, and other giveaways. What is left of the federal government would focus on either winding down the large federal programs that are the chief legacy of the New Deal and the Great Society, or transforming them into barebones platforms that state governments could build on if they choose to do so. Social Security, for example, could be transformed into a ""universal pension,"" a la New Zealand, where everyone over the retirement age receives a flat benefit designed to eliminate poverty among seniors. As an added bonus, this much smaller Social Security program could be financed by a smaller payroll tax, or some other funding source, which would appeal to Tea Party conservatives like Ben Domenech of the Federalist, who hate the regressive payroll tax with a passion. State governments, meanwhile, could create their own add-on retirement benefits, like the publicly-sponsored retirement plan recently proposed by liberal state legislators in California. The federal role in health insurance could go in a few different directions. Virtually all Tea Party conservatives favor repealing Obamacare, as we all know. In a post-Obamacare world, Medicare, Medicaid, and the tax subsidy for employer-sponsored health insurance could gradually be turned into defined contribution programs, with the federal government kicking in a fixed amount of cash for each beneficiary. State and local governments could find creative ways to spend their Medicaid money wisely, and spend more if they see fit. But a small number of Tea Party fellow-travelers, led by Avik Roy of the Manhattan Institute, are making the case that the right ought to use the Obamacare exchanges to their advantage. By deregulating the exchanges, putting most Medicare beneficiaries on the exchanges, and raising the Medicare eligibility age, thus keeping older Americans on the exchanges for longer, Roy believes that the federal government could drastically reduce the growth of federal spending. In effect, the Tea Party could turn the program it hates the most into a Trojan Horse for a decentralized Teatopia. Again, the fundamental idea is to allow states and local governments to let their freak flags fly--to let San Francisco and Cambridge be as left-wing as they want to be, and to let Midland and Colorado Springs be as right-wing as they want to be. And for better or for worse, Teatopia would be far less bellicose than our own America. This week, Michael F. Cannon and Christopher A. Preble of the libertarian Cato Institute, a think tank that has a great deal of street cred in the Tea Party movement, offered an ingenious proposal in the New York Times. Instead of having the federal government provide health and disability benefits to veterans directly, they propose a system of prefunded veterans' benefits. Military personnel would be given enough additional pay to purchase benefits at actuarially fair rates from private insurers. If war is looming, it is a safe bet that private insurers would jack up their rates to account for the fact that service members would face an elevated risk of death and dismemberment. Suddenly the federal government would have to pay for its war-waging ways even before the first shot is fired. Masking the long-term costs of military interventions would no longer be an option. Cleverly, Cannon and Preble find a fiscal solution for what at first glance seems like an intractable political problem, which is the tendency of lawmakers to neglect the lasting consequences of their actions. The military-industrial complex wouldn't wither away overnight. But conservative voters would be far more skeptical about the use of military force if they could clearly see that it all but guaranteed higher taxes. Whether or not Cannon and Preble think of themselves as members of the Tea Party, their proposal illustrates how members of the movement might do things differently than other conservatives. I have mixed feelings about Teatopia. There are aspects of it that I find very attractive. Yet there are other aspects that, as an old-school sentimental American nationalist, give me pause. What I can say is that the Tea Party movement does indeed have a distinctive vision, which will come into sharper focus in the years to come. The Tea Party is not some temporary aberration that will seamlessly blend into the conservative establishment in a few years. It is a real movement, and as America grows more diverse, and as American politics grows more contentious, it will grow."

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/06/the_maximum_family_grant_and_family_caps_a_racist_law_that_punishes_the.html	"Last April, Melissa Ortiz, a low-income mother of four, gave testimony to a committee of the California Assembly detailing her life on the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids program, or CalWORKs, the state's welfare program. ""When we first had the twins, the only person in my family getting aid was my oldest son,"" she said. ""We didn't have money to buy them car seats to get home [from the hospital]. ...We didn't have money to pay for diapers, wipes, shampoos, and toiletries. ... I am here to tell you that I am trying my best to be a great mom. I do not need to be punished for deciding to have children."" Ortiz was referring to the Maximum Family Grant rule, a provision of CalWORKs that denies assistance to new children in families that received benefits 10 months before the child's birth. Other states have similar rules, and broadly, they're called ""family caps."" Ortiz and other advocates are lobbying California state lawmakers to repeal these caps, which they argue are harmful and counterproductive. And they are: With four children, Ortiz received just $516 a month in aid from CalWORKs. ""I had to go to charities, wait in line, and hope that the charities had diapers that day,"" she writes, explaining the impact of family caps on her life. ""I am constantly trying to pay just enough to not have [the utilities] shut off."" For women like Ortiz, new children become a burden to carry--a threat to their livelihoods. But that was always the point. Family caps were designed to make life more difficult for low-income mothers, to thrust them deeper into poverty, and thereby discourage births. Thousands of families occupy the lowest rungs of American society because the state has punished them for having a child it didn't want them to have. What's more, in the 16 states where caps exist--including California, Mississippi, Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, and Arizona--the most affected women look like Ortiz, women of color who have been penalized based on a racist stereotype about their worthiness as individuals and fitness as mothers. Indeed, of all of our country's discriminatory policies, family caps are one of the few that actualizes this prejudice into policy, and in the process, it echoes some the ugliest chapters of our past. Twenty years ago, House Republicans issued their Contract with America, a concise description of their agenda for the next two years, should they win the majority. Republicans promised procedural reforms--open committee meetings and an audit for fraud--and substantive policies, from crime control to new tax cuts. The third item on their policy list was the Personal Responsibility Act, which would ""discourage illegitimacy and teen pregnancy by prohibiting welfare to minor mothers and denying increased [benefits] for additional children while on welfare ... to promote individual personal responsibility."" The language is dry, but the object is clear. If elected to the House majority, Republicans would pass ""family caps"" and keep your tax dollars out of the hands of irresponsible welfare mothers who had babies for cash. In less inflammatory terms, the family cap was intended to create disincentives for mothers on welfare to have additional children, easing the public burden and providing the poor a path to upward mobility. Of course, the policy was based on a myth, the idea of the sexually irresponsible ""welfare queen."" In 1990, just 10 percent of households that received Aid to Families with Dependent Children--the precursor to today's federal welfare program--had three or more children (most had two or fewer). Those figures were down from the 1960s, when 32.5 percent of such families had four or more children. In 2013, the Bureau for Labor Statistics noted that ""average family size was the same, whether or not a family received assistance."" Public perception notwithstanding, there's no difference in family size between those that collect welfare and that those that don't. Moreover, the notion of family caps presupposes that welfare recipients are somehow gaming their reproductive choices in order to gain the maximum return. It's an absurd idea, as few people--of any income level--have the necessary time or sophistication to make that kind of calculation, which hinges on a web of federal and state regulations. And it's even harder to believe that anyone who did would go through the challenge of pregnancy and childbirth for $40 or $50 more a month. Not that this dissuaded conservative lawmakers. State caps began to appear in the early 1990s, with New Jersey and Arkansas adopting caps in 1992 and 1994, respectively. In 1995, true to their promise, House Republicans passed a welfare reform bill with mandatory family caps. In the Senate, however, Democrats joined with moderate Republicans to defeat the caps over the objection of Majority Leader Bob Dole, who warned, ""If we don't deal with out-of-wedlock births, then we're really not dealing with welfare reform."" He continued: ""The crisis in our country must be faced. Thirty percent of America's children today are born out of wedlock. ... Families must face more directly whether they are ready to care for the children they bring into this world."" In the conference report, House and Senate representatives compromised with mandatory family caps and an opt-out provision, but President Clinton issued a veto, leading to a final bill--signed in August 1996--that omitted a cap requirement, but allowed states to use existing policies, adopt new ones free from federal regulation, or avoid family caps altogether. Of the 16 states that have a family cap policy today, most passed in the aftermath of welfare reform and the introduction of Temporary Aid for Needy Families, the current federal welfare program. There's little evidence that family caps work as advertised. What is unquestionably true is that they make poor families poorer. A 2006 report from the Urban Institute found that family caps increase the ""deep poverty"" rate of single mothers by 12.5 percent, and increase the deep poverty rate of children by 13.1 percent. It's easy to see how this works. In Maryland, a state without family caps, the average benefit for a single-parent family of three is $574. If, while receiving that benefit, the parent had another child, it would rise to $695, a 17 percent increase. By contrast, in Virginia--where the benefit for a family of three is $389--it would stay the same (as opposed to growing to $451). And when you consider the generally low benefit levels of family cap states--in Georgia, the average monthly benefit for a three-person household is $280, in Mississippi it's $170--what you have is a recipe for greater poverty. Given the extent to which welfare families--like their high-income counterparts--have a hard time planning their pregnancies, this is little more than punishment for being poor. After all, we don't have family caps for the mortgage interest deduction. And, for all the ways these laws disadvantage poor families, they also fail in their purported mission of reducing family size. Several studies--including a 2001 analysis from the Government Accounting Office--have found no substantial relationship between welfare caps and a reduction in births. ""Despite the political attractiveness of caps,"" writes researcher Michael Wiseman in a 2000 study on welfare policy and children, ""there is little empirical support for expecting them to do much beyond reducing costs. By far the dominant conclusion of the literature on welfare effects on fertility is that such influences, though present, are small and uncertain."" And while a 2004 paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that, in family cap states, ""birth rates fell"" and ""abortion rates rose among high-risk women with at least one previous live birth,"" this same pattern happened in states without a family cap, potentially reflecting the degree to which fertility declined among all American women in the later 1990s. It's an outrage, but it's not a surprise. The case for welfare caps wasn't built from a dispassionate look at outcomes for welfare families. It emerged from our beliefs and stereotypes around the kinds of women who receive government benefits: namely, low-income black women. In the popular imagination, writes legal scholar Laura M. Friedman in a 1995 paper, these women are ""thoughtless child-making people"" who get pregnant in order to collect money from the government. As such, childbirth by welfare mothers--then, as now--is seen as ""undesirable, irresponsible behavior on the premise that people should not have additional children if they cannot afford to support them without governmental aid."" With his stories of welfare cheats and abusers, Ronald Reagan maybe did more than any single individual to popularize this belief. But the best proof that this stereotype had purchase with nearly all corners of American society comes from the cover of the August 1996 issue of the New Republic. It offers a single image: A poor black woman, feeding a child while holding a cigarette, headlining an editorial titled ""Sign the Welfare Bill Now."" The message is impossible to miss: Pass this bill before she breeds again. Family caps, much more than welfare reform itself, are an extension of a racist stereotype. By ending the ""incentive"" of reproduction, goes the argument, caps would arrest the spiral of moral decline and pathology in poor black communities, and end the crime and poverty that presumably flows from black single motherhood. As then-Oklahoma Sen. Don Nickles said in 1995, ""Illegitimacy has been exploding in this country. As a result, we have increased crime, we have increased welfare, and we need to break that cycle."" Or, as conservative scholar Robert Rector put in more gentle terms, ""A 'reform' of the federal welfare system which fails to send a clear moral signal, which remains agnostic on the question of illegitimacy, and which simply allows states to 'do their own thing' with federal taxpayers' funds--or do nothing--would be a disaster."" It's hard to escape the eugenic tint of these arguments. Indeed, when you situate family caps in the broad history of American policy and reproductive rights, it's easy to see the connective tissue between eugenics and benefit cuts to stop ""illegitimacy."" At the turn of the 19th century, several states--Michigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Washington, and California--all passed or attempted to pass forced sterilization laws. In 1929, North Carolina passed ""An Act to Provide for the Sterilization of the Mentally Defective and Feeble-Minded Inmates of Charitable and Penal Institutions of the State of North Carolina,"" which allowed sterilization for both ""improvement of the mental, moral, or physical condition of any inmate"" or ""the public good."" Between 1929 and 1935, under the act, North Carolina sterilized 223 people. In 1935, following a challenge from the state supreme court, North Carolina established the Eugenics Board to provide due process for individuals condemned to sterilization. Initially, the targets of sterilization were inmates and the mentally disabled. But over time policymakers and bureaucrats moved to the physically disabled and other groups. Wallace Kuralt served as welfare director in Mecklenberg County, North Carolina, from 1945 to 1972. During that time, Kuralt expanded the sterilization program to include the poor and destitute, with a particular focus on black Americans. In 1960, black Americans were 25 percent of the population in Mecklenberg. But between 1955 and 1966, noted the Charlotte Observer in a 2011 piece investigating Kuralt's work, they made up more than 80 percent of those sterilized at the request of the Welfare Department. ""When we stop to reflect upon the thousands of physical, mental, and social misfits in our midst,"" wrote Kuralt in 1964, ""the thousands of families which are too large for the family to support, the one-tenth of our children born to an unmarried mother, the hoard of children rejected by parents, is there any doubt that health, welfare, and education agencies need to redouble their efforts to prevent these conditions which are so costly to society?"" Sterilization, he believed, would save tax dollars by reducing poverty among the ""low mentality-low income families, which tend to produce the largest number of children."" Or, as he wrote in an unsigned editorial the same year, ""[A]t the bottom of many welfare problems is the illegitimate child, the unwanted child in his most extreme form."" Proponents of family caps in the 1990s didn't claim that welfare families were irredeemably ""unfit"" and ""feeble,"" nor did they profess to see poverty as a product of innate deficiency. But the preoccupation with the reproductive behavior of the poor, the unsubstantiated belief that they're a drain on public coffers, the focus on black American women, the cries against ""illegitimacy,"" and the calls for action are all reminiscent of the not-too-distant past. Consider that the only exception to the family cap in the CalWORKs program is for births resulting from a contraception failure under an approved method: A contraceptive shot, an intrauterine device, or sterilization.* Put another way, women in CalWORKs have to choose between long-term or permanent contraception or risk becoming pregnant with a child who won't receive state aid. California, it should be said, also has a long and dark legacy of eugenics--more Americans were forcibly sterilized there than in any other state. Some states have ended the failed family caps experiment. In the last decade, Maryland, Minnesota, Illinois, Wyoming, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Kansas have repealed their caps, while other states have modified or revised their programs. And in January of this year, California state Sen. Holly Mitchell introduced a bill to repeal the state's Maximum Family Grant. With wide support from groups like the ACLU, the Catholic Conference, and Planned Parenthood, it promised to end this discriminatory regulation and commit California to $200 million in additional benefits for poor families with children. After passing the Senate Human Services Committee on a narrow 3-2 vote, it made its way to the Appropriations Committee, where it died, on account of its high cost. If it had been passed and signed into law, it would have reduced childhood poverty in the state by up to 7.4 percent. Supporters are crushed, but remain dogged. ""The reproductive justice and anti-poverty advocates who have been working diligently to repeal this harmful and ineffective rule are sorely disappointed and surprised the bill didn't make it out of committee, but we are not giving up,"" said Shanelle Matthews, communications strategist for the ACLU of Northern California, in an email. Given its size and influence, an end to family caps in California might prompt other states to re-evaluate their policies. And if nothing else, it would do a lot of good. As of April, nearly 250,000 families in the state are still subject to family caps. ""One in six California children are living in poverty or something called deep poverty,"" said Sen. Mitchell in a recent speech touting her bill, ""Fifteen red states across the country have reversed their maximum family grant policy."" It's time all states do the same.

9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/06/republican_2016_candidates_at_iowa_republican_party_s_state_convention_rand.html	"DES MOINES, Iowa--Listening to Republican presidential candidates talk to GOP activists in Iowa, it's hard to tell which party is in more trouble. The president and his party are so bankrupt and swaddled in serial stupidities that a string of electoral routs is surely coming, they say. Common-sense voters will drive Democrats from Congress and the presidency before they undermine the American Dream further. Still, each GOP hopeful seems compelled to pitch himself as a Republican savior: the only solution to a broken party that won't win the presidency without his unique brand of political repair. ""You guys have a strong force here,"" said Sen. Rand Paul to the attendees at the Iowa Republican Party's state convention on Saturday, ""but frankly the president won Iowa twice. So we can't do the same ole same old."" Paul's solution is to reach out to younger voters and minorities. Former Sen. Rick Santorum told the crowd of 1,400 delegates he knew how to talk to the working class, which the GOP must woo in order to win in 2016. Gov. Bobby Jindal portrayed himself as a can-do governor in touch with a national grassroots ""rebellion"" and ready to lead a hostile takeover of Washington. Gov. Chris Christie, former Gov. Jeb Bush, Gov. Scott Walker, Sen. Ted Cruz, and Sen. Marco Rubio were not in the important presidential state for the weekend, but each promises that he has the missing puzzle piece to the GOP's presidential election map in his suit pocket. Iowa has what Paul calls ""strong force"" because its caucus starts the Republican primary process. If there is to be a successful national Republican coalition, it will be built by the party's next presidential candidate and that candidate will have to figure out Iowa first. ""Sen. Paul, I supported your father, and I'm ready to help you, too,"" said a young man who stopped him after his speech. Paul asked if he had a business card. The senator threw out plenty of red meat to the crowd, suggesting the president should trade five Democrats instead of five Taliban members in his next prisoner exchange and suggesting that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's handling of the security situation in Benghazi made her unfit to be commander-in-chief. But Paul is considered to be the Iowa front-runner by strategists here because of people like that young supporter. The young, energetic voters who backed his father are ready to work for the son. The other Republicans who stopped Paul in the hallways offering to host him when he returns in August proved that the appeal is also broad. Paul's message to the party was that younger voters are ready to vote Republican if the party follows his lead in appealing to them on issues of personal privacy. ""Every one of them has a cellphone,"" he said of young voters, ""and they don't think it's any of the government's business what they say on it."" Rick Santorum, who was signing copies of his book Blue Collar Conservatives, said the party must focus more on workers if it is going to win national elections. He said 6 million working people didn't vote in the last election. ""Our message is all about corporatism and business,"" he said of the national party. ""We can win every businessman's vote and still lose elections by landslides. ... As far as a lot of workers in America are concerned, we don't care about them."" Santorum's prescription for the party was to do what he did in the 2012 race: talk about rebuilding the country's manufacturing base and rebuilding infrastructure as ways to provide jobs. He also reiterated his pitch that marriage and strong families should be promoted as paths to income security. Jindal was the first out of the gate after Mitt Romney's presidential loss to offer advice. He said the GOP should stop being the ""stupid"" party, which amounted to a prescription to present conservative ideas in a more appealing way and stop focusing on the party's congressional wing. He did not reprise that message to delegates. Instead, he took a more traditional approach, using outrage as his inroad to voter hearts. He cited a string of Obama administration scandals, but put his rhetorical emphasis on what he said was the administration's war on religious liberty. ""I see more frustration in this country than I've seen in decades, and it's not just against Democrats, it's against Republicans as well. People are saying I don't just want to see incremental change. Don't just rearrange the chairs on the deck, we want to see a wholesale takeover."" As a governor, he offered himself as an antidote to ""a president who hasn't run anything before."" A common theme among the possible future candidates is that while the Republican Party didn't need to moderate its policies, it did need to improve its public face. ""Let's stop being a cheap version of the liberal party,"" said Jindal, who then repeatedly told a small gathering of GOP supporters and activists Friday night that ""tone matters"" and that ""we need to be optimistic and cheerful in this fight."" Paul, who has said, ""If we want a bigger crowd, our message has to be a happy message, an optimistic message, one of inclusiveness,"" told the Iowa crowd that it should try to achieve the optimism contained in the message the painter Robert Henri offered to young painters: ""Paint like a man coming over the top of the hill singing."" I asked Paul who he thought represented that optimistic vision of the GOP. He named Jack Kemp, the former congressman and secretary of Housing and Urban Development, who was able to sell conservative policies as a happy warrior rather than a dour scold. ""As I go into communities and talk to African-American conservatives, they tell me that Kemp is the one they remember, more than Reagan."" The Iowa GOP is a microcosm of the tensions within the national party. Each of the constituencies in the larger party--the establishment wing, social conservatives, several Tea Party organizations, and those with libertarian leanings--has a base there. Party leaders are trying to manage these internal tensions in the hopes that they don't squander the state's national reputation and Republican chances to pick up a Senate seat in a purple state. That's why over the last year, Gov. Terry Branstad and his establishment allies worked to retake control of the state party from the libertarian-minded wing that supports Rand Paul. In the past the conflicts between these groups have erupted during the state conventions--this year it was Idaho's turn to have a fight--which is why the Iowa state party co-chair started the day by saying that the watchwords for the gathering were ""Republican Unity."" The party chairman then kicked things off, asking delegates, ""If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all."" Everyone listened. It was a grand unified event with little rancor. Branstad's efforts to win control paid off. If Iowa Republicans figured how to make everyone play nice, it might become a model for future presidential candidates as well as a starting place."

Yet it also made a grave mistake by withdrawing its military forces in 2011. The notion that we were wrong to go in but that we were also wrong to get out is hard to comprehend for many people. Once Americans collectively settled on the idea that the Iraq War was a disaster, it was perhaps inevitable that we'd want to wash our hands of the whole ordeal. President Obama appeared to do just that when he declared in December of 2011 that ""we're leaving behind a sovereign, stable, and self-reliant Iraq,"" knowing full well that we were doing no such thing. The disaster that is the Iraq War did not end when the last convoy of U.S. combat troops left the country more than three years ago, as many of us are now learning as the fragile Iraqi state loses ground to Sunni extremists. There are precious few people who've been right about Iraq from the start. One of them is Brent Scowcroft, who had served as national security adviser in the first Bush administration. Americans had two big opportunities to listen to Scowcroft on Iraq. We blew both of them. In August of 2002, as George W. Bush and his allies were building the case for regime change in Iraq, Scowcroft warned in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that an attack on Iraq ""would seriously jeopardize, if not destroy, the global counterterrorist campaign we have undertaken."" Though Scowcroft was confident that the U.S. could succeed in destroying Saddam's regime, he was also confident that military action would be expensive and bloody, and that it ""very likely would have to be followed by a large-scale, long-term military occupation."" As we all know, Scowcroft's warning went unheeded by the Bush White House. Scowcroft offered another warning in America and the World, a widely ignored book published in 2008 that collected a series of exchanges between Scowcroft and his fellow foreign policy wise man Zbigniew Brzezinski. Recognizing that Iraq remained riven by communal conflict, Scowcroft argued that the country would continue to need a U.S. military presence for at least a few more years. Under Saddam, Iraq's Shia plurality was subjugated by its Sunni minority. The fear among Sunnis has long been that once the Shias come to power, they would be the victims of all manner of reprisals. A similar dynamic has long been at play in Syria, where the Assad regime, closely tied to the Alawite minority, rules over a Sunni majority. It also played a role in the Bosnian civil war, where various ethnic groups fought desperately to avoid minority status, which many believed would amount to a death sentence. This desire to escape subjugation has been the central driver of the various Sunni insurgencies that have rocked Iraq for more than a decade. Some Sunni militants seek not just to avoid oppression and brutality at the hands of Shias but to reassert their dominance, often on the grounds that Shias are deviants or apostates. These are the true bitter-enders, for whom no compromise is possible. Most of Iraq's Sunnis, however, see themselves as essentially defensive in orientation, and willing to lay down their arms if they are promised the right to live in peace. It is only when U.S. officials came to understand the crisis in Iraq as a communal civil war that they knew what they had to do to contain it: reassure the Sunnis that the Shias would do them no harm, if only because U.S. forces would keep Shia sectarianism in check. As Scowcroft explained to Voice of America News in January of 2012, just weeks after withdrawal was complete, Iraq's political leadership still needed to learn to make compromises among various ethnic, sectarian, and ideological factions. And in his view, ""those compromises are probably easier to make in the embrace of a U.S. presence."" The end of the U.S. presence meant that these compromises were less likely, and that a war of all against all was much more likely. It is important to emphasize that Scowcroft was not calling for a permanent U.S. presence in Iraq. Rather, he believed that the post-Saddam Iraqi state needed time to get on its feet, and its new elected rulers needed time and breathing room to repair trust among communities that had spent so long at each other's throats. So why did the U.S. leave Iraq at the end of 2011? Part of it is that many within the Obama administration simply didn't believe that U.S. forces would make much of a difference to Iraq's political future. Ben Rhodes, President Obama's deputy national security adviser, told Dexter Filkins of The New Yorker that ""there is a risk of overstating the difference that American troops could make in the internal politics of Iraq,"" and that a U.S. military presence ""did not allow us to dictate sectarian alliances."" Rhodes is choosing his words carefully, as there is hardly anyone who would argue that a U.S. military presence would or even could put the U.S. in a position to dictate sectarian alliances. There is no doubt, however, that a military presence gives the U.S. leverage to shape political outcomes. The fundamental question is whether even a small contingent of U.S. troops might have reassured members of Iraq's minority communities by shielding them from the worst excesses of a Shia-dominated government, thus undermining those calling for its violent overthrow. Without a U.S. presence, the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has been free to do its worst, up to and including siccing Iraqi security forces on his political rivals. And Maliki's brutality has, quite predictably, sparked a backlash. That, of course, leads us to the other reason why U.S. forces were withdrawn: There were many Iraqis, and in particular many Shia Iraqis, who wanted American troops out of the country. Yet as Kimberly and Frederick Kagan have argued, the Obama administration could have done much more to reach an agreement with the Iraqi leadership. Indeed, Michael R. Gordon of the New York Times reported in 2012 that Iraqi lawmakers sensed that the president was ambivalent at best about committing to Iraq, and this made them far less inclined to pay a political price for hammering out a deal. There are no easy answers as to what the United States should do next in Iraq. The U.S. has so far refused to launch drone strikes in support of the Iraqi government, though the Obama administration might still have a change of heart. Sunni militants are still on the march, and I have to assume that Iraqi Shias are not going to be in a compromising mood in the weeks and months to come. Kenneth Pollack, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution best known for having offered a very hedged, very cautious case for invading Iraq, has recommended that the U.S. government use Maliki's desperation to its advantage by promising Iraq the military support it needs in exchange for sweeping political reform designed to create a more inclusive Iraqi government. But one wonders what might have happened had we listened to Scowcroft--had we kept a residual U.S. military force in Iraq to prevent this nightmare from having occurred in the first place."

In 2009, he helped engineer the Republican strategy of unanimous opposition to President Obama. In 2011, as house majority leader, he derailed a ""grand bargain"" that would have cemented conservative policy reforms--and given Obama a bipartisan victory. He had huge influence with Tea Party members of the conservative coalition, and was widely seen as House Speaker John Boehner's successor. But now thanks to David Brat, a conservative economics professor at Randolph-Macon College, Cantor is on the outside, a victim of right-wing anger, local discontent, and his own hubris. He ran a bad campaign, attacking the right-wing Brat as a tax-hiking liberal, backpedaling on immigration, and neglecting the get-out-the-vote effort that could have saved his candidacy. Not only is this unprecedented--Cantor is the only house majority leader in history (the office was created in 1899 during the 56th Congress) to lose his seat in a primary--but it completely shifts the landscape of Washington politics. If there's a pop cultural analogue, it's not House of Cards--the Beltway's current source for fictional nods--but Game of Thrones. In its effect, Cantor's downfall was the execution of Eddard Stark--a sudden, unexpected event that upsets the status quo, with consequences for everyone, and everything, in its orbit. Politically, it upends the House Republican caucus. With Cantor out as majority leader--he'll resign the position at the end of July--ambitious Republicans are jockeying for their chance at the spotlight. As house majority whip, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California is next in line behind Cantor and sure to run for the spot, but he'll face competition from figures like Rep. Jim Jordan, former chairman of the Republican Study Committee, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, the popular conservative lawmaker from Texas, and Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, the fourth-ranking Republican in the House. More broadly, as Sahil Kapur notes for Talking Points Memo, John Boehner's speakership is now potentially up for grabs; with Cantor out of the game, the court changes for everyone who wants the position. But the fallout goes beyond the leadership scramble. Remember, Cantor wasn't a moderate Republican: In ideology and tactics--he supported the dangerous stand-off over the debt ceiling--he was aligned with the Tea Party. Yes, he had his feuds and disagreements with conservative activists. But given his record, he should have been safe. As my colleague John Dickerson noted, Cantor's ouster is a warning to all Republicans. It doesn't matter that most incumbents will win renomination or that this upset, given both Cantor's poor performance and Brat's unexpected skill, was a fluke. Republicans are shaken, and that could lead the party down a deeper well of obstruction and radicalism. If that happens, we can finally say goodbye to the productive phase of the Obama administration. Insofar that immigration reform was alive, there was some hope that, with an election ahead, Republican leaders might work with the White House on a bill. With Cantor's defeat, however, that hope is dead, replaced with the smoking residue of the Tea Party double-tap. The same goes for the proposed bill to repair the Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County, which dropped the ""pre-clearance"" provision of the law, opening the door to strict voter identification throughout the states for the former Confederacy. Cantor was one of the few Republicans to support a response to the court. ""I'm hopeful Congress will put politics aside ... and find a responsible path forward that ensures that the sacred obligation of voting in this country remains protected,"" he said last June. Later, when lawmakers announced a plan to strengthen the VRA, his office was ""noncommittal,"" but House Democrats were confident that he could play a powerful role in making the bill a reality. ""He's been very positive in his response and I'm hopeful we can bring this bill to the floor before the summer,"" said House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer in March. Now the probably-dead effort to restore the Voting Rights Act to its former glory is certainly-dead. That makes Cantor's defeat a clear victory for voter ID supporters and other conservatives who view ""voter integrity"" as more critical than voter access. With all of that said, it's not clear how this works politically for Democrats, who--as the New York Times reports--were thrilled with his ouster. ""An informal dinner party at the Georgetown apartment of Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, turned into a celebration,"" writes the Times. Given Cantor's occasional role as the destructive, trickster god of American politics, Pelosi's toasting is appropriate. At the same time, however, Cantor's loss emboldens the Tea Party and destroys the already small odds for bipartisan cooperation. Barring a Democratic sweep in November--which almost isn't possible--gridlock is guaranteed for the next two years. If there's an upside for Democrats, it's this: In their drive to pacify the right wing, Republicans could continue their alienation from the American public. In which case, come 2016, the Democratic Party will likely retain its dubious crown as the less hated of the two political parties. No, it's nothing to brag about. But in the zero-sum game of American politics, it's a huge advantage."	What Will and Won't Change Now That Eric Cantor Is on His Way Out	['Hoyer', 'Shelby', 'Brat', 'McCarthy', 'Pelosi', 'Rodgers', 'Obama']	['god']
12	12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/06/eric_cantor_s_stunning_defeat_the_house_majority_leader_tried_to_pander.html	Since the rise of the Tea Party, Republican incumbents in the House have faced a basic political question: Do they represent safe districts, in which case the threat to their survival comes from right-wing populists challenging them in primaries? Or do they represent swing districts, where the graver danger comes from a moderate Democrat running against them in a general election? In the former case, which occurs more often, the ideal stance is to be a principled and unreasonable right-wing conservative. Those subject to Tea Party challenge must not, under any circumstances, cast a vote to raise the debt ceiling, regularize the status of undocumented immigrants, or accept the legal existence of Obamacare. For the smaller group of House members in swing districts, the situation is the reverse. Compromise, reasonableness, and moderation assume their normal place as political virtues. The problem Rep. Eric Cantor faced, and the reason for his unexpected defeat in a Virginia primary Tuesday night, is that he was unable to make this choice in either direction. That was not due to any lack of political sophistication on his part, but because of his role as House majority leader. Like House Speaker John Boehner, Cantor was not in a position to choose between the Tea Party and non-Tea Party. The House leadership must represent both factions, which are not necessarily at war with each other, but which face fundamentally contrary political imperatives. The result of trying to split this difference is an unpalatable mush, delicious to no one. For Boehner, a pragmatist at heart, it has meant an inability to deliver his caucus in support of the budget deals he would have liked to have made with President Obama and a constant, simmering threat of rebellion from his own back benches. For the more ideological Cantor, who tried to represent the Tea Party radicals but also coveted Boehner's job, it yielded a robotic incoherence: no but perhaps yes on immigration reform, no or yes on raising the debt ceiling, often in the same sentence. Vagueness and elision made Cantor inane. An interview with him was like a failed Turing Test. When it came to his own district, which turned even redder in the last round of redistricting, Cantor would have been better off adopting the clear, principled rejectionism of his opponent David Brat. In his Virginia primary, splitting the difference between ideology and compromise showed Cantor's lack of bottom. Trying to bend toward the rational but not negotiate with Obama meant compromising with Obama. Cantor pandered ubiquitously, which was annoying to all and satisfying to none. This is the current cross of the House Republican leadership, the reason Cantor lost, and the reason Boehner has had such a miserable tenure as speaker. You cannot side both with the faction that wants to protest and with the faction that would prefer to govern. But if your job is to lead the Republicans in Congress, neither can you choose between them. A version of this article also appeared in the Financial Times.	Why Cantor Lost	['Brat', 'Obama']	[]
13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/06/david_brat_defeats_eric_cantor_how_did_the_house_majority_leader_lose_to.html	"Not long after the 2008 election, after his party had promoted him to minority whip, Virginia Rep. Eric Cantor summoned a few colleagues to his condo. The topic: How Republicans could take back Congress, as soon as possible. ""We're not here to cut deals and get crumbs and stay in the minority for another 40 years,"" he told them, according to some later reporting by Time's Michael Grunwald. ""We're going to fight these guys. We're down, but things are going to change."" The party would deny President Obama any bipartisan cover on his policies, and then it would beat him. Cantor's plan worked better than anyone dared to predict it would. He whipped every single Republican against the Democrats' stimulus bill; his staff celebrated by sending out a video of Aerosmith playing ""Back in the Saddle."" In April 2009, when he mused publicly that Republicans ""could take back the majority in 2010,"" election handicapper Stu Rothenberg chortled that ""the chance of Republicans winning control of either chamber in the 2010 midterm elections is zero."" Tonight, Cantor surprised the handicappers again. Just days before his June 10 primary the leader's campaign shared polling that had him up by 34 points on conservative challenger David Brat. The challenger was ""expected to fall far short,"" reported the Washington Post, and ""the question in this race is how large Cantor's margin of victory will be."" Wrong again, and wrong for a whole new reason. In the short time between Cantor's rise to the leadership and his humiliating defeat--the first primary thumping of a majority leader ever, since the position was created in 1899--the conservative movement's rumbling populism got the better of its alleged maestro. Republicans, none of whom are old enough to remember 1899 clearly, are lost for explanations. According to some, the leader was undone by bad staff work. He'd become too regal, too inaccessible in the district that kept re-electing him by rote. He was unresponsive to the Tea Party, when he used to be their guy in the leadership--their bulwark against the recidivist sellout John Boehner. At the start of this Congress, hadn't right-wing Florida Rep. Ted Yoho signaled his independence from Boehner by voting for Cantor to replace him as speaker? Yes, he had, with good reason. From the stimulus vote on through the 2011 debt limit fight, Cantor was the Tea Whisperer, the ""wonk,"" the ""young gun"" who wanted the party to run on ideas. He'd remind conservatives that he was elected in James Madison's old House seat--you know, James Madison, author of the Constitution. ""Madison argued that electoral accountability was one of the bulwarks against tyranny embedded in our constitutional structure,"" he wrote in National Review in 2010. ""The tea-party movement is appropriately vowing to hold elected representatives to account."" In power, at least through 2011, Cantor scouted for openings that conservatives could jump through. He acceded to their demand that the first continuing resolution--the money to fund the government, in lieu of an actual appropriations bill--defunded the Affordable Care Act. (Senate Democrats reversed this.) It was Cantor, more than any other Republican with clout, who protected his conference from having to vote on a debt limit-raising deal that would have raised taxes. But conservatives didn't win those battles. They didn't win in 2012--which was sort of the point of punting the hardest choices past 2011 and past the election. Some of the conservatives who lost in 2012 linked up with the conservative counter-establishment--Republicans like Allen West, who'd attacked Cantor for giving the House a light work schedule, and Joe Walsh, who'd voted against every eventual GOP-Obama compromise backed by Cantor. ""Conservatives in the caucus have never trusted him and don't like him,"" Walsh told me. In 2013, Cantor and the counter-establishment flew apart. Less than a month after Obama's second inauguration, Cantor debuted a vision for a new GOP that would ""make life work."" What if the GOP incentivized people to buy better health care and seek more useful college degrees? What if it went a little easier on immigrants? ""It is time to provide an opportunity for legal residence and citizenship for those who were brought to this country as children and who know no other home,"" Cantor said at a February 2013 speech at the American Enterprise Institute. He pushed through school choice bills (The Student Success Act), and helped amend the farm bill to add more work requirements for food-stamp recipients. None of this was ""liberal,"" per se. It just wasn't what the conservative base had asked for, campaigned for, voted for. It was the agenda of the establishment, simpatico with the Chamber of Commerce. The business community had been there to elect Republicans in 2010 (and with less success in 2012), but in 2013 it was asking for Republicans to pass some sort of immigration reform and avoid a government shutdown. Cantor went with Democrats on a three-day tour to boost reform; he sought out a number of ways to avoid a shutdown, including a failed gambit to split the ""defund Obamacare"" vote from a separate appropriations vote. Conservatives came to view Cantor as at best unreliable, at worst an outright enemy. Brat entered the race against him in January 2014, with no obvious support beyond what he could get from talk-radio personalities. Ann Coulter endorsed him, as did Mark Levin (author of a book that argues for a new constitutional convention to enforce conservatism), as did Laura Ingraham. Cantor had no idea how to fight back. The national press (led by the Washington Post's Robert Costa) finally cottoned on to his problems in May, after local activists in Cantor's district beat his choice for a party leadership role. The video of that meeting, shared widely on conservative sites, revealed a party leader struggling to understand what his constituents wanted from him. ""It is easy to sit in the rarefied environs of academia, in the ivory towers of a college campus, with no accountability and no consequence,"" said Cantor, sniping at Brat. The crowd erupted with jeers. ""You throw stones at those of us who are working every day to make a difference,"" said Cantor. ""It's easy to say you are going to stand up to Obama and the left-wing attack machine. But it is an entirely different thing to actually do it, to stand up and be counted."" That got some cheers, but a voice rang out louder than all that: A man yelling, ""Then let's see you do it!"" Cantor, helplessly, tried to tell the truth. ""After Obama was elected, I stood up and I led the fight in opposition to Obamacare,"" he said. ""I personally went to the White House. I confronted Obama in person and held up a printed copy of the 2,000 pages of Obamacare and asked him to defend it. And he couldn't."" It sounded fine, until Cantor turned to his attack line: ""My opponent was MIA, missing in action on Obamacare."" The crowd booed loudly, and booed some more when Cantor attacked Brat for taking a job on an advisory board created by Virginia's Democratic governor. ""Wait a minute!"" said Cantor, desperately. ""Here's the point. The point is, another individual in his position chose to remove himself from the board when a governor sought to increase taxes."" This was incoherent. Was the lesson that conservatives should quit to make a statement or that they should stick around and fight? What did any of this have to do with the agenda Cantor was pursuing in Congress? The meaning of ""fighting back"" had changed, and Cantor couldn't change with it. He'd helped the party claw back power with a strategy of total opposition. The populists and the business groups went along with that. When they split, Cantor failed to realize that the populists were still demanding total opposition, whether it worked or not, however it polled. And he failed to realize that he was outnumbered."

Hillary Clinton told Diane Sawyer that she and her husband were ""dead broke"" when they left the White House. The remark caused something between a flap and a stir. It might even have qualified as a ruckus. The Republican National Committee said it showed that Clinton was ""out of touch"" (the go-to charge in the age of the Great Recession and its aftermath). The next day, Good Morning America's Robin Roberts asked whether Clinton had regrets about how she characterized her financial straits given that so many people are actually struggling. Clinton replied, ""Let me just clarify that I fully appreciate how hard life is for so many Americans today. It's an issue that I've worked hard on and cared about my entire adult life."" Hillary Clinton, the once and future candidate, should hope that people see this as an issue of whether she empathizes with regular Americans. That kind of problem she could handle. The bigger challenge for her as a candidate is that this inartful statement could start the slow erosion of voters' opinions of Clinton's honesty. That's what happened in 2008, and it's a harder problem to fix, especially when you are engaged in a political enterprise where honesty is already as pliable as a chicken bone. It is technically true that Clinton was broke when she came out of the White House. The Clintons had no cushion from a previous lucrative life in the private sector, and they had mountains of legal bills from their court fights. But the Clintons were not unlike the couple with the winning Powerball ticket: broke at the moment but with the promise of significant riches ahead. Clinton had signed an $8 million book deal (for her previous book). Before leaving the White House they bought a $3 million Washington home and a nearly $2 million home in Chappaqua, New York. She and her husband have profited nicely from their experience in public service, mainly from public speaking and headlining big events. Would that we could all be struck dead with this kind of penury. Does Clinton feel your pain? If Hillary Clinton gets caught in the empathy trap, it's her husband's fault. He elevated fellow-feeling to the high place it now has in presidential campaign politics in his race against President George Bush in 1992. It's deadly to get caught out of touch, but Hillary Clinton has plenty of time to find her way to the right side of the economic empathy issue. She's already been trying, talking about income inequality, student loan debt, and the middle-class squeeze. By the time voters actually engage with the next presidential election, this ""dead broke"" kerfuffle will be forgotten and any echo of it will appear in the soft cocoon of a campaign message devoted to her economic policies aimed at the middle class. Yes, there's a debate in the Democratic Party between the populist wing and the Goldman Sachs crowd with which the Clintons are aligned, but Clinton can debate those policies with skill when there actually is a campaign. Her husband will be a key force in testifying to her commitment to these issues. She can neutralize whatever disadvantage she has on this issue in order to let her other qualities shine. What's more problematic for Clinton are questions about her honesty. It has been a weakness for her in the past, and if ""gaffes"" ever sting, it's usually when they inflame an existing caricature. Clinton's honesty is an issue her opponents raised again and again during the 2008 Democratic primaries. It was essentially the theme of the debate in Philadelphia on Oct. 30, 2007. ""I think what we need right now is honesty with the American people about where we would take the country,"" said then-Sen. Obama about Clinton. John Edwards, who was keeping two sets of books in his personal life, nevertheless lectured: ""The American people ... deserve a president of the United States that they know will tell them the truth, and won't say one thing one time and something different at a different time."" Trust and Hillary Clinton became such a theme of the debate that Bill Richardson complained that the entire debate had devolved into whether you could trust Hillary Clinton. The danger for Clinton is that the ""dead broke"" comment will not be seen as a tone-deaf slip-up about personal wealth but as an effort to create a false story when confronted with the uncomfortable fact that she and her husband have made a lot of money fast. (That Clinton resorted to such a clumsy dodge gives you some sense of how uncomfortable she is with the topic.) The misstatement will be irresistible for her opponents who want to lampoon Clinton and press on the trust issue, which is the one that hits voters in the gut. We should expect nothing that happens now to have any impact on an election more than two years away, despite all the Twitter heat and the fact that Clinton moved so quickly to fix her characterization of her post-White House lifestyle. But if it is a sign of a casual dissembling instinct rather than a one-off slip, then it warns of a problem that could accumulate in the interviews and public political moments to come. The reason Clinton's approval ratings go up when she is out of politics is that people don't see her behaving politically. Once they do, her numbers start to suffer. In an October 2007 CNN poll, 51 percent found her honest and trustworthy. That mirrored a Washington Post poll from May 2006 in which 52 percent viewed her similarly. But by April 2008, only 39 percent viewed Clinton as ""honest and trustworthy"" in the Post poll. A Gallup poll at the time showed a similar problem. Of course this was when she had charismatic candidates pounding away at her every day. Polls have recently shown that people once again trust the former secretary of state. In a recent ABC poll, 60 percent found her honest and trustworthy, which shows how much she has done to improve her balance sheet with voters. If the ""dead broke"" clunker is just a sign of rustiness, then it will live on only in the warm-up acts by local officials at GOP rallies. But if there are more of these episodes during her return to public life, it could put her in the red."	Does Hillary Clinton Feel Your Pain? Would You Believe Her If She Did?

Chris McDaniel sounds like a bitter Scooby Doo villain. ""They used everything from the race card to food stamps to saying I would shut down public education,"" he said in an interview with conservative TV personality Sean Hannity. ""I've fought for this [Republican Party] all my life, but they abandoned us, made fun of us and ridiculed us and brought in 35,000 Democrats to beat us."" In other words, McDaniel is saying, I would have won if it wasn't for you meddling liberals. Of course, we should be clear. Because there is no party registration in Mississippi, there's no way to know the affiliation of the people who voted in Tuesday's run-off. McDaniel complains that ""35,000 Democrats crossed over,"" but he can't know for sure. Instead, he's made an assumption: These black voters are Democrats, and their votes are illegitimate. ""There is something a bit strange, there is something a bit unusual, about a Republican primary that's decided by liberal Democrats,"" he said after the election. He's likely right that the voters were Democrats--Mississippi's voting is entirely polarized along racial lines--but given the open primary he has no room for complaint. There's nothing fraudulent about Sen. Thad Cochran's appeal to black Mississippians, nor is there anything irregular about their participation in a Republican primary that will determine the state's representation in the U.S. Senate. As Sen. Roger Wicker, the junior senator from the state, said to reporters on Wednesday, ""Broadening the base of the party? Asking more Mississippians to participate in the ballot that's going to determine the next senator? No, I don't think there's anything wrong with that."" Obviously, McDaniel does. And in holding that view--whether he knows it or not--he channels a long history of similar complaints. For as long as blacks have been able to vote, there have been politicians who sought their support. And for just as long, there have been critics who called it unfair. ""What think you of the Grants and Colfaxes?"" asked former Confederate Major Gen. Howell Cobb in an 1868 speech to Democrats opposing Ulysses Grant for president. ""Of the Thad Stevenses? The Sumners and Wilsons of the North ... who wrote it upon their platform: 'The people of the South, you must submit to negro suffrage, you must submit to negro supremacy; but for our own people we reserve the old landmarks of the Constitution.' "" Cobb, who died before the election, had laid down the core argument of the contest. Who is America for, Democrats asked, the white man or the black? Their answer was simple: America was a white man's country, and if elected, the Democratic ticket--led by Horatio Seymour and Frank Blair--would oppose the Radical Republicans who sought ""military despotism and negro supremacy."" As Blair declared in a September speech while touring towns along the Pacific Railroad, ""The great masses of this mighty Republic have no affinity with the negro. The right of elective franchise is for the white man alone."" The Republican Party disagreed, and--campaigning for its nominee, Gen. Grant--it appealed to pro-Union Northern whites and newly enfranchised Southern blacks (who had the right to vote under the military governments of the former Confederacy). ""During the 1868 campaign,"" writes historian Eric Foner in Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, ""Yazoo County, Mississippi, whites found their homes invaded by buttons depicting General Grant, defiantly worn on the clothing of black maids and cooks."" The result was a win for Grant, who entered the White House on the strength of the first truly biracial political coalition in American history. Having lost the white vote, Grant owed his slim majority of roughly 300,000 to the more than 700,000 blacks who supported his ticket. That didn't escape his Democratic opponents, who accused Republicans of fraud and denounced Grant as an usurper. ""It is now ascertained beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Jacobin candidates were elevated to office against the wishes of a decided majority of the white voters of the country,"" wrote one angry voter in a Washington territory newspaper, ""If we take into calculation the white men denied a ballot by the disenfranchisement of the states of Virginia, Mississippi, and Texas ... the radical ticket was successful against a majority of more than one million white men."" This notion, that it was wrong to appeal to blacks and illegitimate to win with their votes, would dog President Grant throughout his first term, and into the 1872 election, which he won--once again--on the strength of black support. By the 1876 presidential election, white supremacist terrorism had driven countless black Americans from the polls, and by the 1880 contest, black suffrage was on the wane--Southern states had begun the long process of disenfranchisement, using law and violence to keep blacks out of politics. For more than a half-century, black Americans were absent from mainstream politics, the victims of Jim Crow oppression and national neglect. Still, the idea of illegitimate black votes lived on. After the Texas Populist movement won influence with multiracial coalitions of poor white and black voters, Democratic leaders responded with mechanisms to ensure white hegemony, like the ""white primary."" The goal was simple: to keep blacks out of the political process and to stigmatize whites who tried to bring them in. None of this is to say McDaniel is the same as these people in the past. But history often rhymes, and we see elements of old arguments in the controversy over Cochran's win. Indeed, we saw them during the 2008 Democratic primary, when Hillary Clinton dismissed the then-Illinois senator's support from black voters, calling it narrow: ""I have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on,"" she said in an interview with USA Today. As evidence, Clinton cited an Associated Press article ""that found how Sen. Obama's support among working, hard-working Americans, white Americans, is weakening again, and how whites in both states who had not completed college were supporting me."" Likewise, Obama's 2008 presidential win was followed by conservative hysteria over ACORN and the New Black Panthers--described as vehicles for mass voter fraud--as well as skepticism of his standing with the public. ""[T]he president and some of his policies are significantly less popular with white Americans than with black Americans,"" wrote Byron York for the Washington Examiner in 2009, ""and his sky-high ratings among African-Americans make some of his positions appear a bit more popular overall than they actually are."" In other words, if you stick with the voters who count--white ones--then Obama isn't as popular as he looks. Yes, in some sense, these are all the complaints of sore losers. But they tell us something important about American life: When it comes to race and politics, there's almost nothing new under the sun."

Yet there is something badly broken about the Golden State. At its best, California is America's America, where the young and adventurous go for a fresh start. The trouble is that housing in much of California has become so expensive that the young and adventurous have been priced out, leaving its most beautiful stretches to wealthy insiders. Last weekend, I had the great pleasure of visiting the Bay Area, to see friends and to attend a conference. The conference was held in a beautifully-situated resort in Marin County overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge, where a small number of low-rise buildings dotted a pristine landscape. And I thought to myself, as I often do, that it was insane that this land was not instead dotted by massive high-rises housing thousands of people. The beautiful town of Sausalito has a population of just over 7,000 within its 21/4 square miles. But would it be any less lovely if it were home to twice as many people, or 10 times as many even? Or would it be lovelier still if graceful towers full of young families sprouted on land currently devoted to, of all things, golf courses? Or consider San Francisco, one of the least-affordable major cities in the United States. San Francisco's population is about 825,000. If it had the same population density as my hometown, New York City, it would instead have a population of 1.2 million. Note that I'm referring to the population density of all five boroughs of New York City, including suburban Staten Island and the low-rise outer reaches of Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. A San Francisco of 1.2 million would not be a Blade Runner-style dystopia in which mole people were forced to live cheek-by-jowl in blighted tenements. San Francisco at 1.2 million people would still be only half as dense as Paris, a city that is hardly a Dickensian nightmare. One of the many benefits of allowing for more housing in a city like San Francisco is that it would likely lead to sharp reductions in carbon emissions. San Francisco is among the greenest cities in the United States, thanks largely to its superb climate. The same goes for San Diego, San Jose, and Los Angeles. The economists Edward Glaeser and Matthew Kahn have estimated that a San Francisco household spends one-fourth as much on electricity as a comparable household in Houston, as coastal Californians have far less need for air conditioning. To be sure, California does face serious environmental challenges. For example, that California's water resources are stretched thin. But redirecting water resources from agricultural to residential uses would make an enormous difference, as would pricing water resources more intelligently. The environmental upside of supersizing San Francisco and other coastal California cities far outweighs the downside. So what exactly is the problem? Well, the idea of a much denser San Francisco strikes many residents as appalling, not least because they fear that new development would threaten the city's distinctive architectural character and the gorgeous views afforded by its stringent land-use regulations. While I love quirky Victorian houses as much as the next bobo, aesthetic considerations can't justify the fact that San Francisco has become an oversize gated community. Rents in San Francisco are three times the national average, and they are rising at a fearsome clip. The housing crisis is even more severe in booming Silicon Valley, where the housing stock has barely increased over the last decade, despite the fact that the region has become a magnet for tech professionals from around the world. When skyrocketing demand meets stagnant supply, the predictable consequence is that housing costs soar and low- and middle-income families find themselves displaced. Perhaps you believe, as many otherwise intelligent people do, that the law of supply and demand is somehow inapplicable to the housing market. Consider the following. While San Francisco's housing stock grew by 8.8 percent between 2000 and 2010, for an average annual growth rate just under 0.9 percent, the average annual growth rate of the housing stock in inner Tokyo was 2 percent. The shocking result is that while rents have been rising rapidly in San Francisco, they've been falling, albeit slightly, in Tokyo. If anything, San Francisco should be building far more housing than Tokyo, the capital of a country that is aging rapidly and that welcomes a trivially small number of immigrants. Rather than allow for more housing development, California's political class has embraced the campaign to raise the minimum wage. The statewide minimum wage is already set to increase to $10 by July 2016, and labor activists have been pushing to raise it higher still. Not to be outdone by Seattle, Ed Lee, the mayor of San Francisco, has called for a $15 minimum wage for local workers to be put in place by July 2018. Whether or not minimum wage hikes are the best way to raise incomes (I tend to agree with Slate's Jordan Weissmann on this issue), it's worth noting that according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, you'd need to earn $29.83 an hour to afford a market-rate one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco, or roughly twice Mayor Lee's proposed minimum wage. Even the most enthusiastic proponents of minimum-wage increases will generally accept that you'd price some workers out of the labor market at a wage floor twice as high as Seattle's. Relying solely on minimum wage hikes to make San Francisco housing affordable for local workers will ultimately mean driving all workers who can't command a high wage out of the local labor market. Does that sound like much of a solution to you? In The Gated City, Ryan Avent observed that high housing costs in America's most productive cities had forced large numbers of middle- and low-income households to either accept long, costly commutes, which eat into the ability of families to work and save, or to move to low-cost, low-productivity regions. Over time, this greatly impairs the ability of working- and middle-class Americans to climb the economic ladder. Moreover, when you move large numbers of people from high-productivity, high-wage regions to low-productivity, low-wage regions, you lower the productivity of the entire country. In other words, the rich homeowners who are fighting development in San Francisco and throughout coastal California are actually making America poorer. That's not cool.

17	17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/06/thad_cochran_wins_with_mississippi_s_black_voters_african_americans_help.html	"On Tuesday, black Democrats saved an elderly white Republican from political oblivion in the nation's most racially polarized state. That's not an exaggeration. On June 3, six-term Sen. Thad Cochran lost Mississippi's Republican Senate primary to Chris McDaniel, a talk radio host and Tea Party-backed state senator with a long history of divisive and extreme rhetoric. But because of their vote totals--neither candidate broke 50 percent--the race went into a runoff. And the assumption from then until Tuesday was that Cochran would lose. After all, if there's a rule in American elections, it's that turnout goes down in a small, obscure contest like a Senate runoff. With his intense grass-roots support and wide backing from national Tea Party groups, McDaniel was the favorite. Cochran had a choice: He could play the game the way it's always been played and lose his seat, or he could bend the rules to his favor. He went with the latter. ""His campaign,"" wrote the New York Times last week, ""is taking the unlikely step of trying to entice black voters to help decide the most high-profile Republican contest in the country."" Between open primaries (anyone can vote in any primary, as long as he or she didn't vote in a previous one), low turnout in the Democratic Senate primary, and racially polarized voting (the vast majority of whites are Republicans and the vast majority of blacks are Democrats), Mississippi contained a huge number of eligible black voters who could turn the tide if persuaded to vote for Cochran. Yes, by backing Cochran, blacks would guarantee a GOP win in the fall--Democratic candidate Rep. Travis Childers probably had a better chance of defeating McDaniel, with his extremist views, than of defeating Cochran. But Mississippi is the most Republican state in the union; the difference between Cochran and McDaniel is the difference between likely Republican and leans Republican. Either way, Republicans were favored. In which case, black voters had to choose between the man they knew--a relative moderate who deals in earmarks and largess--and a new man. If you know anything about Chris McDaniel, this wasn't a hard choice. For as much as he's described as a generic Tea Partier--an angry, abrasive conservative extremist--the truth is a little more complicated. Remember, the ""Tea Party"" isn't a single ideology as much as it's a collection of related ideologies under a single banner. The civil libertarianism of Sen. Rand Paul, for instance, is distinct from the compassionate conservatism of Utah Sen. Mike Lee, which is distinct from the Goldwater libertarianism of Sen. Ted Cruz. If McDaniel resembles anything, it's not a libertarian--although he swims in the current of right-wing libertarianism--as much as it's a Southern reactionary whose appeal is built on resentment of assorted others, which in Mississippi, inevitably includes black Americans. Take these clips from his radio show, circa 2006, where he mocked complaints of racism, railed against hip-hop as a ""morally bankrupt"" culture that ""values prison more than college,"" and promised to stop paying taxes if reparations were ever passed: ""How you gonna make me pay for something that I had nothing to do with? How you gonna do that to me? I don't get it."" As a state senator, McDaniel has spoken to gatherings of the Sons of Confederate Veterans--a neo-Confederate group that promotes present-day secessionists--and delivered the keynote to a SCV event last fall. Indeed, his rhetoric decries the rise of a ""new America"" and pines for days of old. ""There are millions of us who feel like strangers in this land, an older America passing away, a new America rising to take its place,"" he said in a speech after the June 3 election. ""We recoil from that culture. It's foreign to us. It's alien to us. ... It's time to stand and fight. It's time to defend our way of life again."" His voters get the message, lashing out against those people who siphon dollars from hard-working Americans. Here's the Times with more: ""Everybody's got their hand out like these damn people at the food stamp office,"" Mr. Harris, 67, said between sips of coffee on Thursday at a local barbecue restaurant. ""They've got to put an end to all of this spending."" [...] On Friday, Mike Thornton, 65, was browsing the wares at a hunting and fishing superstore called Sportsman's Warehouse. Mr. Thornton, a land surveyor, said he could not really see what federal dollars had done for Mississippi, other than encourage lazy welfare recipients who were ""working the system."" Cochran's appeal to black voters was simple. We may not agree on much, but at least you can work with me. It succeeded. While turnout increased everywhere on Tuesday, it jumped highest in Cochran's strongest counties, Jefferson and Humphreys, which also stand as the blackest areas in the state. ""Black pastors here organized their congregations to back Cochran as if he were a Democrat,"" reports Perry Bacon Jr. for NBC News,  ""noting that the incumbent had helped fund historically black colleges and other initiatives that appeal to African-Americans and linking McDaniel to the Tea Party, which black voters feel is unduly harsh to President Obama."" Overall, notes Nate Cohn for the Upshot, ""Turnout increased by 4,156 votes in the handful of counties where black voters represent more than 65 percent of eligible voters."" White voters also turned out in greater numbers, but given the final results--191,508 votes for Cochran versus 184,815 votes for McDaniel--there's a strong case that blacks were a necessary part of Cochran's victory. Right-wing conservatives aren't happy. Cochran won ""through a combination of race-baiting attacks on McDaniel, and touting his ability to make government larger and bring home more goodies from Washington,"" wrote John Hayward for Human Events. Following his lead, more than a few bloggers--and a whole lot of tweeters-- have accused Cochran of ""race-baiting"" for making active appeals to black voters. ""GOP primary voters in Miss wanted Cochran out. GOP establishment wanted him in. So they turned to Dems & race baiting. But I repeat myself,"" said one conservative on Twitter. I think we can agree this is ridiculous. Cochran was well in his rights, and the law, to expand the map of the electorate. To appeal to new groups of voters--to ask them to consider your policies and their impact on their communities--is to play politics in its purest form. Cochran didn't cheat, he changed the game. And because of his views and his rhetoric, McDaniel couldn't play."	Why Black Democrats Saved an Elderly White Republican From Political Oblivion	['Cochran', 'Cruz', 'Perry', 'Obama']	[]
18	18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/06/kochs_american_enterprise_institute_and_happiness_and_well_being_research.html	"When Arthur C. Brooks stepped on stage in December, the influential conservative's mission was simple, yet ambitious: ""If I do my job,"" Brooks began his speech, ""in the next few minutes I'm going to give you the secret to happiness."" Standing before large block letters that spelled ""H-A-P-P-I-N-E-S-S,"" the charismatic president of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, explained how genetics, major life events, and choices all contribute to one's well-being. Brooks mentioned the importance of forging close relationships with family, promoted charitable giving, and emphasized that ""money doesn't buy happiness."" Nearing the end of his nearly 20-minute speech, Brooks said happiness also depends on ... free markets? ""The earned-success system that brings you happiness is the system of free enterprise that lifts people out of poverty,"" Brooks said. ""Don't work for the statism, the collectivism that suppresses this,"" he added. ""Work for the free enterprise that makes this possible."" Proponents say the free market system encourages investment, stimulates innovation, and increases efficiency. But according to Brooks, it also makes you happy and improves your well-being--even if you're poor. The message appears to be part of a new public relations initiative spearheaded by America's most high-profile free-market advocates: Charles and David Koch, the billionaire brothers who have built a powerful political empire based on libertarian principles. Brooks, whose high-profile think tank receives funding from the Kochs, was recently tapped to serve on the advisory board of the Charles Koch Institute's ""Well-Being Initiative,"" which ""aims to advance our understanding of the meaning, foundations, and drivers of human flourishing"" through research, education, and discussion. The initiative may be billed as a way to explore well-being, but some critics of the Koch brothers are skeptical. ""The question needs to be: Whose well-being are we talking about?"" asks Tony Carrk, a director at the Center for American Progress, a liberal advocacy group. ""The policies that the Koch brothers have promoted and put forward seem to only benefit those at the very top, at the expense of everyone else."" Officials from the Charles Koch Institute did not respond to requests for comment. The Kochs oversee a political ecosystem whose influence stretches far and wide--from think tanks and universities to trade associations and political action committees. As their public profile has risen, so too has criticism. In January, Koch Industries, America's second-largest privately held company, hired Steve Lombardo of the global public relations firm Burson-Marsteller as ""part of an effort by the Koch brothers to tell their story better,"" according to Politico. ""Koch Industries is working to improve the daily life of people around the world,"" Lombardo said, ""and I look forward to working with the team to bring this story to the global marketplace."" In May, Politico reported on a memo from the Koch brothers' powerful political group Americans for Prosperity, which laid the groundwork for its future political operations. ""[W]e consistently see that Americans in general are concerned that free-market policy--and its advocates--benefit the rich and powerful more than the most vulnerable of society,"" the memo read. ""We must correct this misconception."" Koch and the ""true nature of well-being"" Charles Koch informally introduced the Well-Being Initiative in a January blog post titled, ""The Importance of Well-Being."" ""Through sound research, broad education and robust discussion, the Initiative aims to advance understanding of what it means to flourish, how to understand and measure the various aspects of well-being, and how to empower individuals to live better lives,"" he wrote. The Charles Koch Foundation, a separate nonprofit from the Charles Koch Institute and a supporter of the Well-Being Initiative, recently posted on its website calls for research proposals, seeking ""doctoral students interested in contributing to the academic exploration of the role free societies play in advancing human well-being and prosperity,"" one proposal request states. Before it recently underwent a redesign and many old links died, the Charles Koch Institute's website had highlighted past well-being events and work published by Brooks and other board members dating back to last fall. It also linked to Brooks' ""Secret to Happiness"" speech. In December, Brooks published an op-ed in the New York Times titled, ""A Formula for Happiness,"" which mirrored his American Enterprise Institute speech. A few months later, in a Times op-ed about income inequality and what he referred to as the ""rising sympathy for income redistribution,"" he argued that there is ""a strong link between economic envy and unhappiness."" In February, Brooks even managed to pull off the unthinkable: He got the Dalai Lama, a self-described socialist, to visit the American Enterprise Institute, which decries socialism. The title of the panel discussion featuring the Tibetan leader: ""Happiness, free enterprise, and human flourishing."" Brooks did not respond to requests for comment. Some recent well-being forums sponsored by the Charles Koch Institute have featured panel discussions on the economy, criminal justice, and higher education, among others. On Wednesday, the Charles Koch Institute will host what it's calling its ""Inaugural Well-Being Forum"" at the Newseum in downtown Washington, D.C. Not-so-diverse board The five-member advisory board of the Well-Being Initiative includes Angel Cabrera, president of George Mason University, and Tyler Cowen, a popular libertarian professor at the school and Slate contributor. As the Center for Public Integrity reported in March, two of the six private charitable foundations the Koch brothers control and personally fund combined in 2012 to pump more than $12.7 million into colleges and universities. George Mason University has received more Koch money than any other school. ""The Charles Koch Foundation has been generous to the university, and they have supported various efforts in areas that are important to us, so this time around they wanted my guidance and advice, and I thought it would be a great thing to do,"" Cabrera told the Center for Public Integrity in an interview. Cabrera--not a libertarian, he says--explained that the Koch's Well-Being Initiative lines up with the university's strategic plan, which includes a well-being component. He refuted the idea that this initiative was all about promoting the Koch brothers' libertarian ideology. ""If they had a predefined definition or ideology that they wanted to push with this effort, the last thing you want is free, independent thinkers telling you what to do,"" he pointed out. The initiative seeks to explore various research areas, including something called ""neuroeconomics""--a field of study that merges brain science and economics to explore economic decision-making. Advisory board member Paul Zak, aka ""Dr. Love,"" is a neuroeconomist and founding director of the Center for Neuroeconomics Studies at Claremont Graduate University. He is widely known for his research into the brain chemical oxytocin--which he calls the ""moral molecule"" that is key to improving social interactions, including those involving financial transactions. Zak has concluded in his research that free markets are inherently moral. In an interview, Zak told the Center for Public Integrity that he had reservations about joining the advisory board when he was first approached by Koch Institute officials about nine months ago. ""I said, 'You guys have kind of a dicey reputation,' "" Zak recalled, noting that he disagrees with some of the Koch brothers' political efforts. ""And they said, 'Yeah, we know, and we want to start funding some good science so that we can allow people to draw their own conclusions.' "" Zak said officials convinced him that the Well-Being Initiative is apolitical. ""It seems non-agenda driven,"" he said. ""We really want to understand [well-being] better and we want lots of people to use this. Let's try to make a really global, useful, broad index and just see what it tells us about government policies, about economic growth, about all of these things that can affect people's well-being."" Still, Zak acknowledges that the initiative's advisory board is dominated by libertarians. ""Could [the board] be more diverse?"" he asked. ""Probably."" More libertarianism The other two advisory board member positions are filled by William Inboden, a professor of public affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, and Chris Rufer, the president and founder of the Morning Star Co. A former fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, Inboden was previously the senior vice president of the London-based Legatum Institute, which publishes the ""Prosperity Index,"" ranking countries based on wealth, economic growth, and quality of life. Rufer is a board member of the Free to Choose Network, which produces broadcast programs that air on PBS stations. Last November, the network produced Economic Freedom in Action: Changing Lives, a documentary about how the ""rise in economic freedom has led to increased prosperity and longevity, allowing more people to rise out of poverty and build positive futures for themselves and their children."" The program, funded in part by Chris Rufer and his wife, aired on stations all across the country. In an interview with the Center, Rufer said the Koch brothers' message has been misinterpreted by the liberal media. ""Is it a PR move?"" he asked. ""Call it PR. What do you do when you put on a better shirt so you think the girls will look at you? Is that fraud? It's not fraud. You're just trying to represent yourself."" This initiative, though, is good PR to a good end, he said. ""If you're maliciously trying to deceive, well that's bad,"" he said. ""But look at well-being and look at libertarianism and I think you'll see it's pretty consistent ... because that is the objective of libertarianism: human welfare.""

Barack Obama. The Hillary Clinton of 2014 is a much more popular figure and far more dominant candidate. She outpaces every potential competitor, with supermajority support among Democratic voters, and a ready network of operatives, donors, and organizations. We still don't know how she'd run a second presidential campaign--would she repeat the strategic blunders of 2008?--but on the surface, she's far stronger than she was. She even has an answer to the Iraq question, seven years after it ruined her first run for the presidency. In her memoir/campaign book Hard Choices, she writes that she ""got it wrong. Plain and simple."" And in an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. promoting the book, she said that she would ""absolutely not"" send ground troops to fight extremist forces in Iraq and ""would not support any effort by the United States to back up"" the current government ""unless the conditions that we had been asking for for a number of years had finally been met."" But a pat answer isn't the same as understanding, and looking at her time in the Obama administration, it's clear Clinton hasn't actually learned anything important from her Iraq war vote, other than I shouldn't support wars in Iraq. Indeed, when it comes to other interventions in other countries, Clinton is as hawkish as she ever was. In every internal administration debate during her four years as secretary of state, Clinton backed the most aggressive approach. She supported the surge in Afghanistan, pressed for the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden, and supported the intervention in Libya. She was an early advocate for arming the rebels in Syria, and in her book, she defends drone warfare as ""one of the most effective and controversial elements of the Obama Administration's strategy against al Qaeda and like-minded terrorists."" This logic even extends to Iraq. Yes, she says her vote was a mistake, but at the State Department she was aggressive in pushing for a long-term troop presence in the country.

Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick said that his representation of Abu-Jamal ""made a mockery of the jury's verdict and the court's sentence,"" while conservative outlets from Fox News to the Washington Times denounced Adegbile as a ""cop-killer coddler"" and worse. In the end, the frenzy of criticism was enough to spook Democrats and derail his nomination. A month later, the Republican Governors Association used similar tactics in an attack on Vincent Sheheen, the Democratic nominee in the South Carolina gubernatorial race. In an ad, the RGA denounced Sheheen for ""personally defending dangerous criminals""--in other words, doing his job as a defense attorney. Despite tough criticism from South Carolina legal groups--Alice Paylor, head of the state bar association, called it an attack on ""the Constitutional principles that are essential to a free society""--the RGA never removed the ad. This attack has resurfaced this week, this time as a criticism of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who worked as a public defender in Arkansas in the 1970s. On Tuesday, the Washington Free Beacon released audio recordings of Clinton discussing her criminal defense of Thomas Alfred Taylor, a 41-year-old accused of raping a child. For the Free Beacon, this audio--which includes ""Clinton's suggestion that she knew Taylor was guilty at the time""--""calls into question Clinton's narrative as a devoted  women and children's advocate in Arkansas."" And on Friday, the Daily Beast added to the pile, publishing excerpts from an interview with Taylor's rape victim in question, now 52, who says ""Hillary Clinton took me through Hell."" Like the the Free Beacon, the Beast suggests that this complicates Clinton's reputation. ""Whether or not Clinton was just doing her duty as a defense lawyer,"" writes reporter Josh Rogin, ""for the victim, Clinton's behavior speaks to her character, her ambition, and her suitability to be a role model for women or president of the United States."" It's immensely valuable to have the victim's perspective vis-a-vis Clinton's performance in the case, but the idea that this should be held against her--like Adegbile's advocacy or Sheheen's work--is ridiculous. It is the job of defense attorneys to do the best they can for the clients they have. Anything less--varying the quality of their work according to the caliber of their clients--is literal malpractice, to say nothing of its corrosive effect on the foundations of our legal system. A world where a lawyer's reputation is ruined because of who she represented or because of how zealously she did her job is one where the worst of the accused have little recourse. We would never apply this standard to another profession. No one would attack a police officer for protecting a drug dealer's neighborhood, or sanction a doctor for saving a thief's life. What's more, no one would hold those actions as a liability for public office. We would understand, correctly, that people in public life don't get to choose who they help and who they reject. Simply put, Republicans and their allies are playing a dangerous game with these attacks. In a broad sense, they risk delegitimizing the idea of a public defense. And in a narrow one, they discourage public defenders from entering politics, which is a problem. As it stands, American politics has a huge bias toward the state's side of the criminal justice system; of the 200 congresspeople with a background in law, 32 served as prosecutors and 7 served as judges. Defenders are almost nonexistent. The result, in part, is a political culture eager to crack down on crime, but less interested in rehabilitation or reducing incarceration. You don't have to support Hillary Clinton or her politics to see the problem with turning her career as a defense attorney into a partisan issue. If you believe in the rights of the accused and the right to legal representation, then these critiques of Clinton, while understandable, are wrongheaded."

Eric Cantor's defeat last week was a message from grass-roots conservatives to Washington's Republican leaders: No more business as usual. But on the eve of the election to replace Cantor as majority leader--the second most powerful person in the House of Representatives--it doesn't look like there's been much of a change in how the House will function. Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who was in the No. 3 position, is now going to be elevated to Cantor's old post. McCarthy is not an agent of change. On the issue of immigration, for example, which helped inflame opposition to Cantor, McCarthy is even more moderate. (He has in the past expressed support for giving undocumented immigrants a path to legal status.) House Speaker John Boehner, whom grass-roots activists criticize as a capitulator and dealmaker, is more powerful than ever, because without Cantor waiting in the wings, there is less threat that another member of the House could harness his grass-roots critics. Republicans in Washington got the message after Cantor's surprise loss--just ask the pollsters and strategists who have gotten calls from newly nervous members. But the limits of the damage caused by the Cantor earthquake were evident shortly after it happened. Conservatives were unable to unite behind a single alternative to McCarthy. Even if they had, they wouldn't have been able to find the votes. Republicans must still legislate, and when it comes to the process of corralling votes and moving legislation--the essential business of legislating--it can't be done by ideological stalwarts and political purists. It must be done by the people who know how to round up votes. McCarthy's ascension suggests a coming challenge if Republicans take control of the Senate and bring both chambers of Congress under one banner. If that happens, it will be in large measure due to the power of grass-roots conservatives, and yet at the same time it will put the party in a position where compromise and the forces of pragmatism will be stronger than ever. That's likely to cause greater clashes in the running debate between those who promote tactics necessary to govern and those who see those tactics as signs of ideological weakness. If Republicans win the six seats they need to take control of the Senate, they will owe a debt of gratitude to Tea Party supporters and other true believers. As the most committed members of the party, grass-roots conservatives will be the ones who turn out to vote in the greatest numbers. Conservative voters will also have played a big role in Republican Senate races in Georgia, Nebraska, and maybe Mississippi, where incumbents will be replaced with conservatives of a more modern flavor. But if Republicans take control, the party will face a situation not unlike the one House members faced after Cantor's ouster: They will immediately be faced with a set of quick decisions necessary to govern. In the House, that meant electing new leaders, which gave an advantage to those who have skill at leading a legislative body. If Republicans take control of Congress, the advantage will go to Sen. Mitch McConnell and Boehner, men who have been vilified for the budget deals they reached with the president. In those budget deals, both men, and the Republicans who backed them, operated on the theory that the party would be hurt more by getting blamed for government shutdowns and government defaults than by angering the ""hell no"" caucus. That will be their view after the next election. If Republicans control Congress in 2015, these fights between the pragmatic and the ideological will be even more pronounced because the pragmatic wing running the show will operate under two theories that will bolster their pragmatism. The first is that they must pass legislation to prove that Republicans can actually govern. Such legislation, even if it is ultimately blocked by a Democratic filibuster or a presidential veto, will require compromises that will be unpopular with Tea Party conservatives. The second theory is that pragmatists will be worried about looking like they are over-reaching by scoring political points on pet ideological projects, which will hurt the party in the 2016 congressional and presidential elections. That will inspire more caution for fear of turning off swing voters. In the Senate, there are 24 Republican incumbents up for re-election in 2016. The states Republicans will be defending--Florida, Illinois, Iowa, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin--will have more diverse electorates than Mississippi or the Virginia district that just ousted Cantor. If Hillary Clinton runs, there are likely to be more women voting in the elections that year. That's not a group with whom Republicans have traditionally done well. Those GOP senators are going to want to run on accomplishments. There will be pressure to pass legislation that will appeal to a broad swath of voters and that affects their daily lives. Such legislation will require compromise. There will also be pressure not to launch extended show trials into the IRS, Benghazi, and other issues, especially after the vote on repealing Obamacare, which would almost certainly be the first vote in a Congress under Republican control. All of these realities have the potential to irritate core conservatives, who will wonder what good it is to have control if leaders aren't going to stand on principle. The Tea Party's victories of 2014 may lead to another test for its grass-roots base: either become better followers or purge more leaders."

The legislation, which President Obama quickly signed into law, gave the secretary of agriculture the authority to write new rules requiring schools to serve up more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and less salt, sugar, and fat. It marked a high-profile victory for Michelle Obama, who by then had already made fighting childhood obesity her trademark issue as first lady. While it's still early, the rules are proving effective by most accounts. More than 90 percent of the nation's schools say they've implemented the new nutrition benchmarks, and public health experts are largely happy with the results. Fruit and vegetable consumption in schools is up, and, counter to some anecdotal evidence, less food is going to waste, according to a recent report from the Harvard School of Public Health. But if House Republicans have their way later this summer, those healthy meals may no longer be on the menu when students return to school this fall. House Republicans have tucked a provision into the agriculture spending bill currently winding its way through Congress that would allow any school cafeteria that lost money for six straight months to ask for a one-year reprieve from the new standards. The waiver would apply not only to the new set of rules but also to a forthcoming set of health standards that further ratchet up the requirements. That means that the provision wouldn't just keep some lunches from getting healthier but would likely allow some schools to offer less healthy lunches than they do now. Conservatives hoping to let money-losing kitchens serve up trays of cheaper, less-healthy fare say the existing rules already threaten to make cafeterias go broke and leave picky students to go hungry. But those behind loosening the nutrition standards are ignoring a more pressing issue: The ballooning waistlines and deteriorating health of America's children--specifically the kids in their own home states. Of the 29 Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee who voted last month to keep the waiver in the bill, 17 hail from states that include portions of what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dubbed the ""diabetes belt."" A dozen of these Republican lawmakers represent states with the dubious distinction of having rates of overweight and obese children among the 10 highest in the nation. Among the worst offenders, according to the 2011 National Survey of Children's Health: Alabama, home to Rep. Robert Aderholt, the subcommittee chairman in charge of setting funding levels for school nutrition programs and the chief architect of the waiver provision; Kentucky, represented by Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers; and Texas, which boasts a trio of its own powerful Appropriations subcommittee chairmen. In all, only four of the panel's Republicans come from states that have a percentage of obese and overweight children significantly lower than the national average of 31.3 percent. Not that any member of Congress can gloat: Utah Rep. Chris Stewart's home state's rate of 22.1 percent is the best in the nation but would still be among the worst in the world. Due in part to the child obesity epidemic, some doctors fear this generation of American kids may become the first to live shorter, less healthy lives than their parents. Nonetheless, GOP leaders insist the long-term health crisis must take a backseat to the near-term financial concerns of school cafeterias--which currently need to meet the healthier standards in order to secure federal reimbursement for a portion of the meals they serve--and the companies that produce the food in the first place. The idea of giving schools an easy out has plenty of critics, and not just the first lady and the president, who has threatened to veto the bill if it rolls back the improvements won in 2010. The White House counts roughly 100 national organizations--ranging from the Children's Defense Fund to the March of Dimes--as allies in its fight to preserve the updated school nutrition rules, with a growing chorus that has specifically come out in opposition to the waiver itself, including the Center for Science in the Public Interest and Mission: Readiness, a group of retired military officials who warn that the nation's obesity crisis is becoming a national security issue now that more than one in five Americans is too heavy to enlist. Republicans have their own high-profile ally in the waiver fight: the School Nutrition Association, a group that includes both the cafeterias that serve the food and some of the companies that produce it. The organization was a big booster of the first lady's campaign to push through the new standards in 2010. But four years later the SNA, under new leadership, has switched sides. ""These overprescriptive regulations have made it really difficult for a lot of our members,"" SNA president Leah Schmidt told NPR last week. ""And we are in this for our members."" Republicans say the change of heart proves that the first batch of standards, which went into effect two years ago, were too aggressive. It's impossible to say exactly what was behind SNA's official switch, although a recent report from the Environmental Working Group suggests an obvious answer: processed food giants that stand to gain from the loosening of the nutrition rules. According to the EWG's tally, more than 60 percent of the $10.5 million the SNA collected in 2012 came from sponsorship fees from large, processed-food companies. (SNA disputes the group's math, but its own estimates nonetheless suggest the number is around 50 percent.) This year alone, Domino's, PepsiCo, and a handful of others have already ponied up at least $10,000 each to sponsor the School Nutrition Association's annual conference. Nor is there uniform opinion about SNA's new posture. Nineteen of the group's past presidents have publicly broken with the organization over the waiver issue, sending a letter to Congress last month asking them to strip the waiver from the spending bill. ""We must not reverse the progress that was sought by school leaders and is well on its way to success in most schools,"" they wrote. The potential impact and reach of the proposed waiver remain hard to predict. According to Department of Agriculture figures, roughly 90 percent of school cafeterias say they're meeting the new rules. But since it is possible that some kitchens that are already meeting the standards could be operating at a loss, the number of schools that apply for a waiver could in theory be greater than 10 percent. Proponents of the new nutrition standards believe that Republicans have intentionally written the provision to encourage a greater number of schools to opt out. In an interview with Slate late last week, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack suggested the current food fight is Act Two of a three-act political play. It began with last year's fight over food stamps, he said, and won't end until next year when lawmakers have to reauthorize the Child Nutrition Act, which lays out funding for the school lunch program, among other things. ""I have to hand it to them, this is a politically shrewd move, an opportunity to energize their base,"" he told me. ""There are some people who oppose this government program just because they don't like the government."" Republicans pushing to exempt schools from improved nutritional standards deny they're playing politics but aren't hiding the fact they have no plans to stop soon. During a committee hearing last month, Florida Democrat Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz asked Rep. Aderholt if Republicans were looking to eliminate the new standards all together. ""Not in this bill,"" the Alabama legislator replied, drawing a round of laughter from the room."

23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/06/republican_party_black_voter_outreach_how_the_gop_can_win_african_american.html	"It sounds like a plot point from a bad '90s cyberthriller, but my email inbox might have a sense of humor. Let me explain. On Tuesday morning, I received an alert from the Brennan Center for Justice, announcing its new report on the prevalence of voting restrictions. In the four years since the 2010 election--when the GOP swept state houses across the country--22 states have passed restrictive voting measures, from voter identification laws to limits on early and weekend voting. While some restrictions were overturned by the courts or weakened by the Justice Department, others remain on the books, with provisions set to take effect before the midterm elections. ""In 15 states,"" notes the Brennan Center, ""2014 will be the first major federal election with these new restrictions in place."" Despite Republican rhetoric--which defends these measures as justified to stop ""voter fraud,"" to protect ""voter integrity,"" and to ensure ""fairness"" in the system--it's clear that partisanship has a lot to do with the proliferation of voter restrictions. As a recent study from the University of Massachusetts in Boston detailed, restrictions were more likely to pass ""as the proportion of Republicans in the legislature increased or when a Republican governor was elected."" Likewise, it's obvious from the pattern of restrictions that race plays a part. ""Of the 11 states with the highest African-American turnout in 2008, 7 have new restrictions in place,"" reports the Brennan Center. What's more, ""nearly two-thirds of states--or 9 out of 15--previously covered in whole or in part by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act because of a history of race discrimination in voting have new restrictions since the 2010 election."" In case you think this is some weird coincidence, it's worth going back to the UMass-Boston, which finds that ""the proposal of restrictive voter-access legislation has been substantially more likely to occur where African-Americans are concentrated and both minorities and low-income individuals have begun turning out at the polls more frequently."" In other words, Republican voter restrictions are most likely in places where black people vote the most. And there's also evidence that legislative support for voter identification is motivated, in part, by racial bias. Which brings us back to my email. After the Brennan Center alert, the next message in my inbox was a press release from the Republican National Committee. The subject line? ""RNC Chair Reince Priebus To NABJ."" The NABJ, for those unaware, is the National Association of Black Journalists, the largest organization of journalists of color in the nation. Priebus is visiting--along with Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz--as a speaker for the NABJ's annual convention, where he will speak on the GOP's outreach to black Americans. ""I ... look forward to discussing our ongoing efforts to engage black voters, expand the dialogue in communities across the country and inform the very journalists who help shape the views of a very important constituency,"" he said. By now, I'm sure you see the humor here. Announcement one: Republican-pushed voter restrictions target blacks and other minorities. Announcement two: Republican leader plans to talk outreach with black journalists who--among other things--report on voter restrictions. With that said, you don't need a fortuitous email coincidence to make this connection. Of everything Republicans have done to alienate themselves from the vast majority of black Americans, voter restrictions--and voter identification in particular--stand as the most egregious offense. Indeed, the GOP push for ID requirements in 2012 sparked a backlash in black communities across the country. ""There are forces at work that don't want you to vote,"" said one ad in Cleveland before the election, ""and will do anything they can to make it difficult for you to vote. You're stronger, you're smarter than that."" Ohio joined Pennsylvania and Florida as voter ID states with higher-than-normal black turnout in 2012, which suggests a relationship: Angered by attempts at voter suppression, black voters went to the polls in huge numbers, causing the long lines that defined coverage of that Election Day. Between the RNC's new investments in minority engagement and his visits to historically black colleges, I have no doubt that Priebus is sincere about outreach to black Americans. At the same time, the bulk of the Republican Party has committed itself to shrinking the electorate of low-income and minority voters as an alternative to growing beyond its base of aging whites. Which is to say that, before speaking to the NABJ or any other group of black Americans, the RNC chairman might want to turn his attention to his fellow Republicans and try to push them away from their current path. Voters are more likely to listen to your appeals--and even take them seriously--when they don't think you're trying to keep them from casting ballots."

You promised an easy victory and an inexpensive reconstruction, financed by the conquered nation's oil revenue. You built your case on the presence of weapons of mass destruction in the targeted country, and then switched gears--this was a war for ""liberation""--when none were found. Within a year of the invasion, it was clear your advocacy was a mistake. The easy occupation never materialized, and America was stuck with an expensive quagmire. The war you helped engineer had become a disaster for everyone involved, with countless deaths and trillions in wasted dollars. Now, more than a decade later, the United States has ended its war and left this country to handle its own affairs. And in short order, it has collapsed into chaos and anarchy, thanks to sectarian leadership and deadly extremists. Given your role in building this catastrophe, you should be barred from public comment, since anything you could say is outweighed by the damage you've done. But this assumes a world where elites, like yourself, are accountable for their ideas. Not only are we not in that world, we're in its opposite, where failed elites are invited to pontificate on their failures, as if they haven't been already discredited by their performances. Which is how we get to this past Sunday, where former Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz was on Meet the Press to opine on the appropriate response to growing violence in Iraq--as if he weren't the disgraced architect of a disastrous war that led to today's violence. In his comments to David Gregory, Wolfowitz called for an open-ended commitment to the country, analogizing his preferred approach to the long-term U.S. presence in South Korea. ""We stuck with South Korea for 60 years, South Korea is a miracle story, but if we had walked away from South Korea in 1953--that country was a basket case."" Ignore, for a moment, the fact that the circumstances of Iraq are vastly different than those of Cold War Korea. Or that, as my colleague Fred Kaplan notes, ""the collapse of Mosul ... has little to do with the withdrawal of American troops and everything to do with the political failure of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki."" What's amazing about this is the extent to which Wolfowitz is treated as a serious interlocutor. It's as if his history never happened, and he were just another pundit with another perspective. More egregious than Wolfowitz on Meet the Press was Bill Kristol on ABC's This Week, where he also held forth on the violence in Iraq. ""It's a disaster unfortunately made possible, certainly made more likely by our ridiculous and total withdrawal from Iraq in 2011,"" said the former Iraq war cheerleader, who famously declared, ""American and alliance forces will be welcomed in Baghdad as liberators."" He continued, ""President Obama said two days before Election Day, in 2012, al-Qaida is on the path of defeat, the war in Iraq is over. That was enough to get him re-elected, but how does it look today? Al-Qaida is on the path of defeat, the war in Iraq is over. Neither is true. It's a disaster for our country."" For Kristol the prospect of ""defeat"" is enough to justify a new presence in Iraq, regardless of the costs to American soldiers and Iraqi civilians. If you want intelligent commentary on this situation--or any other--you'd do well to stay away from anything Kristol says. What's maddening about all of this is that it's only the beginning. With Iraq in the news again, a whole host of war boosters have re-entered the public conversation, despite their utter lack of credibility. As the No. 3 man at the Pentagon under George W. Bush, Douglas Feith pushed a report on Iraq and al-Qaida that then-Vice President Dick Cheney called the ""best source of information"" on the alleged link between Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden. If we lived in a reasonable world, Feith would be barred from talking on the subject of Iraq. As it stands, he's making the rounds of commentary. Here he is in Politico, which treats him as a disinterested observer, and not someone with a clear stake in shifting the blame:"	The Neocons Botched Iraq. Now They Want to Tell You What They Think.

25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/06/columbine_aurora_newtown_isla_vista_families_of_shooting_victims_talk_about.html	"On Tuesday, a man with a gun killed a student and wounded a teacher at an Oregon high school. Two days earlier, a couple on an anti-government rampage shot two police officers and a man in a Walmart. And the week before that, Elliot Rodgers killed three people and wounded 13 in a shooting spree in the college town of Isla Vista, California. Those are just the recent fatal shootings that made headlines. At Slate, after the devastating mass shooting at Newtown, we tried to track each gun death for more than a year. The data were incomplete--and the total was still 12,042. In the wake of the Isla Vista shootings, the father of one of the victims, Richard Martinez, spoke out in an effort to ""make my son's death mean something."" He has joined a brave, sad band of family members who have made preventing more gun violence their cause. At Slate, we wanted to know what it's like to do this work, day in and day out. How does it feel to watch the shootings recur? How do you keep going? On Monday, I sat down to talk with people who have lost loved ones to gun violence. They'd gathered in Washington, D.C., for a conference hosted by the Brady Campaign. Tom Sullivan lost his son Alex, on his 27th birthday in Aurora two years ago (12 dead, 70 wounded). Sandy and Lonnie Phillips lost their daughter, Jessica, 24, also at Aurora. Carlos Soto, who is 16, lost his sister, Victoria, a 27-year-old teacher, at Newtown (26 dead, two wounded). Tom Mauser, who joined us by phone, lost his 15-year-old son, Daniel, at Columbine in 1999 (13 dead, 24 wounded). Eddie Weingart lost his mother when he was 2 years old; she was murdered by her ex-husband. Andrew Goddard's son, Colin, then 21, was shot four times at Virginia Tech (32 dead, 17 wounded). Colin recovered and also works to prevent gun violence. Here's an edited version of our group conversation. We've embedded a few audio clips along the way. Slate: Thank you all for coming. Tom Mauser, let's start with you, since it has been 15 years since Columbine. What is the best thing and the hardest thing about doing this work? Tom Mauser: I really love working at convincing people. It's like I've taken my son's place on the debate team at Columbine. An awful lot of people are with us, but you have to work through a lot of things that are in the way. I love working on that--taking on the cliches of the other side, and letting people see there are ways to answer the questions they have. The worst part is the intransigence and lack of civility of the other side. I don't consider my side to be anti-gun, by the way. It's pro-gun safety, and the prevention of gun violence, not anti-gun. Slate: As people who have lost family members, what do you bring that helps cut through some of the cliches Tom is talking about? Tom Sullivan: The picture I try to put out there is that I'm every man. I went to high school, married at a young age, built a house, built a family. I was in the service. I went to college. We took our kids places on their birthdays. We went to the movies on Alex's birthday. The first movie his sister remembers seeing was The Rocketeer, when Alex was 6. You try to tell that to people--I'm just everybody, it could be you. I came to the conclusion: This is my cross to bear. I can carry this. You want to hate on someone, hate on me. And then, maybe we have a chance of changing this. Now after UC-Santa Barbara, there is this father, Richard Martinez. And I see there's a reaction [to him], of ""I've seen this happen before, and then I've moved on."" I'm sorry, you can't just move on. You see a father, a mother, you have to do something. Even if that only means you talk about it, with your kids, at church, at the PTA. You can no longer go, ""it's their problem."" No, it's our problem. Sandy Phillips: Lonnie and I were, I don't know whether to say cursed or blessed, after Newtown happened, we were asked to go to Newtown. It was a week after the shooting. Those people remember our being there. They don't remember us. They just remember somebody who had already gone through it was there. We had the same experience in Isla Vista. The community may not ever remember Lonnie and myself on a personal level. But they will remember someone cared enough about them to show up, to wrap their arms around them. Slate: Carlos, do you remember Sandy and Lonnie coming to Newtown? Carlos Soto: I wasn't there. That first week was a blur to me. I believe I lay in my bed for the whole week. Slate: How did you come out of that? Carlos: I came out of it when I took a trip to D.C. three months after it happened, to lobby and to speak out. I kind of just wanted to get away. I went down, and I met Sandy and Colin, and it really changed my life. Slate: Did they give you any advice? Carlos: At the first meeting I went to, a senator was against us. Sandy told me: Use your frustration as motivation. Tell your story. And I remember Colin telling me to go back to school. Slate: How old are you? Carlos: I'm 16. Eddie Weingart: When I first became an activist on the gun issue, I was 15 years old. My [mother's shooting] happened when I much younger. All those years of dealing with the grief and anger, at a young age, I really felt like I was the only one. I felt like nobody could understand that pain until I went to a vigil for my cousin's best friend, who was killed in a drive-by shooting. There was a mother who lost two sons and a brother to gun violence. It was a joy in a weird way to know other people I could turn to. That was the biggest blessing. Because we all know there are added elements, compared with ordinary grief, to what we've experienced. Slate: How is your experience different from ordinary grief? Sandy: It is excruciating because of the way your loved ones have been killed. Knowing the details. The Newtown families, their little babies were shot 11 times with a 223 that destroys so much tissue and bone. To know that information. To know the way Tom's son was killed, and my daughter was killed, how many bullets, where they struck them, what their last moments were like. It's very traumatizing. Yet all of us have chosen to find our voice, to use our voice because these stories hopefully impact our fellow Americans to take corrective action. In time that will happen. Unfortunately, our numbers are growing every day. Lonnie Phillips: With Richard Martinez, I had the pleasure of meeting him by phone and email. I feel like I'm connected to him, because of the emotion. We could tell him, ""Look, you're in shock right now."" It helps Sandy and me. It gives us as much as we give, or more. You know, no one recovers at any given rate. You can't say to someone that happened two years ago, why haven't you moved on yet? Sandy: You never recover. Eddie: No, never. Lonnie: Richard Martinez came out swinging, he came out angry. We didn't even find a voice for two weeks, and here he is, on the day of, uttering phrases that are catching people's hearts. ""Not one more."" His voice gets louder and louder, and it's another addition to the movement. People are rallying behind him--tell us what to do. Tom Sullivan: When this happened to Andy and Tom Mauser, seven years ago, 15 years ago, they didn't get a phone call from another parent who had been through something similar. My family was on the front page of 97 newspapers. One of the first images that came out [of Aurora], other than the yellow tape, was my family, finding out. I didn't get any phone calls then from another family member who had been through this. This is a new phenomenon. Slate: Are you able to make these connections partly through social media? Sandy: That's part of it. It's hard to approach new victims and survivors. You don't know what they want. They don't know. On social media, you can just reach out and say, ""we're here."" Andrew Goddard: I've been quiet because my situation is different from others here. I didn't lose someone. Colin's alive. It was so close. I got the impetus to do something without having to pay the price. I got to look over the cliff, but not go over it. I'm an engineer. I spent most of my life in developing countries doing disaster relief. You get parachuted into a war or a drought or a famine, you size it up, you make a plan. Here I am, my son is in a French classroom on a Monday morning in college, and he gets four bullets. Something is terribly wrong here. So, what went wrong? I looked at all the things that brought him and the bullets together. I realized, a lot is going on here that people don't talk about. First I went to the NRA page online, to find out what they have to say. Well, forget that. Then I called Brady, and they said, we're really sorry. But they didn't want to intrude. I think a lot of organizations felt they had to have kid gloves with the families. But now I think it's quite common, you go to them, and they're all over it. Even to the extent of initiating contact, respectfully and carefully. Sandy: Absolutely. Slate: Tom Mauser, in watching this unfold over a long time, what has the biggest shift been over time? Tom Mauser: It's a tough thing to work on. It really takes an investment of time, getting people over the tendencies of Americans to simplify issues to something very basic. For too many, it's, ""Well, it's our right to have guns, and we're trying to take their guns away from them."" Also, there is the tendency to look for excuses. With each one, especially the mass shootings, people say: That happened because the shooter was mentally ill, or bullied, or something else. I think people hear the stories and think it's the person, not the gun. But when you look at the totality--at all the individual shootings, the ones the media doesn't cover--you see one thing behind all the stories is easy access to weapons. Eddie: Newtown was a waking moment for everyone. These were 5- and 6-year-olds. The innocence, it's overwhelming. Lonnie: Richard Martinez paid reverence to Newtown by saying ""those people only had their children for 6 years. I had at least 20 years with my son."" Slate: Sandy, when we talked on the phone last week, you were worrying about Richard Martinez burning out. I wonder what you said when you talked to him? Sandy: We said to Richard, ""you can't honor your son if you collapse. You have to take care of yourself."" I don't think I'm speaking out of turn here for any of us: When you get that news, you don't want to live. Then somewhere along the course, somewhere, you go, ""excuse me, crap, I'm going to live through this."" Eddie: I have to. Sandy: Yes, I have to live through this, and I have to make a change. You learn to roll with it. You sense when you're going to hit a wall. I was just talking with Nicole Hockley, one of the mothers from Newtown, about how you can almost time it. When you're in a situation like we're all in, where you're telling your personal story, at an event such as this, where you're learning how to tell it better. Slate: Which is a weird thing in itself. Sandy: Yes. This is your life. You can't rewrite the script. You can only tell the story and make it more impactful. That takes its toll every single time you do it. I had someone tell me one time, ""Oh, it will become almost rote."" I said, ""Oh my God, if that ever happens, then I need to leave the movement. Because if it doesn't break my heart every single time I tell that story--"" Lonnie: Then you're not authentic. Sandy: Then I'm not authentic. And that's not real. So you allow your heart to be broken every day you tell that story because you need someone else to understand the heartbreak that is part of this. You can't walk away from it. You redefine yourself because you've had to redefine yourself. You're no longer the person you were the moment before you learned-- Lonnie: We have a before Jessie life, and an after Jessie life. Tom Mauser: Yes that's the case. For me, 15 years later, when I speak to groups, I still break up. I let that happen. One thing we face, it's always in my head, knowing that when you get emotional, when you feel that sorrow, there's someone on the other side being dismissive. They're saying, ""Oh yes, we know it's hard for you, and you're so emotional, we understand why you blame guns."" Because they don't really want to face it. They want to just be able to say, ""Oh they must be distraught. They're not thinking straight."" Andrew: You know, there's a big fallacy out there about the idea that if you are emotionally motivated, then you are suspect. You tell me that the other side isn't emotionally motivated? Of course they are. Their emotions are as important to them as ours are to us. So many people say your emotion is clouding your judgment. You're not looking at this thing from a balanced perspective. No, I do look at all sides of things. But I'm still driven by the same emotions to get something done. Tom Sullivan: There are those who tell me, ""You're using your son's death to further your agenda about guns."" I tell them, ""Yes you're absolutely right. For once, I'm using my son's death. I know for a fact he would be proud of me.""Slate: Looking online, I found a few families of victims who are speaking up for the guns rights side. I imagine that on the one hand, you feel like you have to respect that, and on the other, it must be pretty hard.* Sandy: Everyone finds their own path. I don't agree with their choice. But that's my issue. I'm sure they question me. And that's OK. Andrew: Virginia Tech was this huge thing that came out of left field. I thought, wow, this will change something. There were so many people killed. A lot of rich white kids, basically. It was a shock to me when people told me at the time that it's not a sprint, it's a marathon. Pacing yourself is very difficult. I have a cycle. There are times when another shooting happens, and I can take it. It helps me, in a sense, it reminds me that's what we're doing this for. Other times, a daily shooting, I can't take it. It depends where I am in my cycle whether it will lift me up or push me down. My wife noticed I was getting bitter. It's because the other side uses language they shouldn't use, arguments with no logic to them. I like to argue logically. There are times I've said, I can't do this anymore, we're not getting anywhere. And then a couple of weeks later I'll look back and think, I was having a bad time then. What was I thinking? Tom Mauser: Columbine happened in a very Republican district. I was the only parent who was very vocal on the gun issue. One mom spoke at the Million Mom March in 2000, but by and large, others didn't speak out. I know a number were sympathetic. But they didn't want to get involved. Those people were really important to us in the first few years, the other parents. We had different views, but we got along. And when I took to them the petition to close the gun show loophole in Colorado, they all signed it. I think that's very typical of America, that when you get away from the rhetoric and cliches, and present something logical, people say, 'oh, really, right now someone can go to a gun show and buy a gun without a background check? That's not right--where do I sign?' Even parents, who were pro-gun, they signed the petition. Lonnie: Tom, they'll sign the petition, but how do we get them to vote? They've got to vote. Slate: I wanted to ask you about state versus national legislation. You have seen some movement in the states, but also the tremendous push and failure, last year, on the federal level. What lesson do you draw from that? Lonnie: We have to go to the state level. That's where the action is. It's how the NRA and their lobbyists got laws passed--one state at a time. We came close on a federal level. We won by a majority. But in this democracy, you have to have 60 percent. Sandy: Because of the filibuster rule in the Senate. Andrew: I play more defense than offense, in Virginia. Tom Mauser: Yes, but in a lot of states, you can put something on the ballot and have a vote of the people. As we did in Colorado and Oregon to close the gun show loophole. I think that frightens them. Certainly in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia they'll win, but in a number of states they'll lose the vote of the people. Slate: How do you all think about the mental health aspect of gun violence? In some ways this debate offers an opportunity to get more mental health services. On the other hand, it can feel like an excuse for not dealing with the weapons. Sandy: I'm so glad you said that. We've met with senators who will say, ""I'm all about getting a mental health bill."" Yet they're the very ones who cut the funding. So they're speaking out of both sides of their mouths. And they know they can't even get the mental health community to agree on what needs to be done. So they use that as excuse not to pass background checks. Andrew: It's the squirrel they throw out for us to run after. Slate: What do you mean? Andrew: The idea that all gun violence is perpetrated by mentally ill people, and if we could get a hold of treating them ... actually, when people are honest, they're often not talking about treatment. They're talking about locking people up. Look, we've had a mental health problem in this country, of poor financing, poor controls, for decades. Or centuries. Now, in some of the mass shootings, there's this little tiny confluence between that huge mental health problem and gun violence. It's something people latch on to. Like violent video games. We need to be doing something about mental health for the 99.9 percent of people with mental illness who are not getting proper treatment. Not because of the 0.1 percent who are dangerous. Lonnie: To put this in perspective: All the other industrialized countries have the same problems we do, except one. They have video games. They have mentally ill people, probably in the same proportion. They don't have a proliferation of 300 million guns. Tom Mauser: We have to call the mental health issue the smokescreen that it is. In most states a mentally disturbed person--a person who has been adjudicated as mentally disturbed--can still go to a gun show and buy a gun without a background check. Sandy: On the Internet, there is one site with more than 70,000 guns for you to buy with no background check whatsoever. Slate: Gun violence cuts across class and race. But it disproportionately affects poor people and people of color. I wonder, as people who are white and affluent, or middle class, if you feel some sense of responsibility about that. If we didn't have mass shootings, in places that seem like they should be safe, would anyone care? Eddie: I have the privilege to go into minority communities in D.C. that have been affected by gun violence, and they're disheartened. I know a gentleman who was three years old when his mother was killed, in very similar circumstances to my mother. He's African-American. Our grief is the same. But he says, your story comes across louder. That breaks my heart. Slate: Could each of you say one thing about how you keep going? How do you do that? Lonnie: You're probably going to get the same answer from all of us. Slate: Which is what? Lonnie: I keep going because of my daughter. Andrew: I didn't lose my son, so I keep going because of what I've learned and the people I've met. I've said many times, I don't think I could do this, if I had gone down the road you have. Because I'd be so busy looking to my own survival. Sandy: It's funny, because we look to people like Andy who didn't lose anyone, and you look at people who haven't lost anyone, who are still involved for 20 or 25 years, who are still involved and passionate. Those are our heroes. Now he turns around and says we're his heroes. There is a very tangible love you feel in this movement that also keeps you going. Lonnie: Tom, you're senior here. Why are you still here? Tom Mauser: To me, it's to honor my son. And to not have other people lose a child like my son. You know, unfortunately, people don't really want to see victims. And usually they don't. A lot of people who have been victimized are so traumatized, and they don't seek out a lot [of attention]. But I've had so many young people write to me and say, ""I didn't know about Columbine, I want to read about the victims."" And there's not a lot you can read about, other than the real basic stories. I try to take it a little deeper, to help them understand how senseless it is. We want to put a face to this. We want people to understand that it could be them. You don't think it ever could happen to you, but it can. Sandy: Anyone. Anytime. Anyplace. Andrew: You can't insulate yourself. There are certain risks in life you can take steps, you can be fairly sure you won't be involved. But gun violence comes looking for you. Slate: Tom Sullivan, that sounds like where you started us off. Tom Sullivan: I was caught unaware. I thought I had been doing things right, as I said at the beginning. I thought I had put my family in safe situations. The wolf wasn't at the door. They didn't have wants for things. Even though I did all of that, I send my son out for a birthday, and he can't come home from that. I'm not blaming anybody. I'm not blaming myself. But I need to understand how this kind of stuff can happen and why this happens, and what I can do to see that it doesn't happen to someone else. You have to do something every single day. If that only means reading a magazine article, making a phone call, talking to a friend, then that's what you do. I'll continue to do that. I've said to our legislators in Colorado: I'm not going to be able to see my son age another day, but by God, I'll come down here every year and watch you people age. Year after year. I'll be here. Sandy: Amen. Update, June 19, 2014: Due to a mistranscription, in one instance this article misquoted Tom Sullivan as referring to his son Alex as his daughter."

Both Brat and his Democratic opponent, Jack Trammell, are professors at the liberal arts school outside Ashland, Virginia. With both candidates relatively unknown, journalists are scrambling to know what to say about them. Fortunately, the students of Randolph-Macon have some opinions of their own. Rate My Professors--a website where students can leave totally unbiased and reliable reviews of their teachers--has seen a sharp uptick in activity in the past 24 hours, as students jostle to share their classroom experiences with the two political contenders. Both Trammell and Brat's Rate My Professors pages have three new reviews as of Wednesday morning, leaving Trammell with a sizeable margin over Brat in the overall ratings category: a 4.2 out of 5 over Brat's 3.4. Still, the race to win students' admiration may be closer than the numbers suggest. Both Brat and Trammell appear to be generally well-liked and respected by students. Brat was memorably described as ""unparalleled"" and ""almost too smart to teach."" Even when this economics professor is bad, Brat shows his political savvy, with one student saying that he is ""so charming you forget to be mad at him."" Trammell also received some rave reviews, with one student calling the sociologist the ""BEST PROFESSOR EVER!!!"" and another proclaiming him to be ""Brilliant."" Perhaps the most important Rate My Professors metric comes not from what students hear, but from what they see. I am of course referring to the hotness rating. Which of these scholars turns students on? Both, apparently. While ""total eye-candy"" Brat had the edge on Tuesday, with a glowing red chili pepper rating, as of Wednesday morning, he and Trammell are tied at a standard red chili pepper. Whether or not either candidate gives us butterflies during office hours, one thing is certain: This congressional race is some hot stuff."

President Obama has just signed an executive order that expands eligibility for Pay As You Earn, a newish program that caps the monthly debt payments of eligible borrowers to no more than 10 percent of their monthly income. And if you still have outstanding debt after 20 years, or 10 years if you work in the public sector or for a nonprofit, it will be forgiven, like a youthful transgression. You crazy kid! Remember when you thought taking on this student loan debt made sense because getting a college education meant that you'd eventually earn enough to pay it off? Oh gosh. Those were the days. Clearly you had been passed the peace pipe once too often. Cutting debt payments for cash-strapped borrowers is a nice gesture. In 2008 and 2012, Barack Obama fared well with under-30 voters, and Pay As You Earn will give some of them a nice little boost, just in time for the midterm congressional elections. But there is a much larger problem that the president's feel-good proposal fails to address, which is the fact that people who take on federal student loan debt aren't earning enough to pay it back. America's higher education institutions aren't offering value for money. And that's a problem that tinkering with the federal student loan program won't solve. To state the obvious: Borrowers can't handle their debt payments because of the general weakness of the economy. It would be far easier for borrowers to repay their student loan debt if they weren't unemployed or underemployed, and it would be easier still if they were employed in jobs that offered robust wage gains over time. Yet the debt crisis also reflects the corruption of mass higher education in America. You'll notice that I've been referring to borrowers and not to college graduates. There's a good reason for that. A large number of the Americans burdened by student loan debt never actually finished a degree. I can't give you an exact figure because, until recently, the federal loan database didn't actually track completion. What we do know, however, is that those who complete degree programs tend to earn substantially more than those who don't. The college wage premium, or the ratio of the median hourly wage of college graduates and that of those who've only graduated from high school, increased at a fast clip in the 1980s and the early 1990s, but it's been hovering around 1.8 for the past several years. That is, college grads have a median wage 80 percent higher than high school-only grads. The premium for those with ""some college"" has been stuck between 1.15 and 1.2 for about 30 years. Some of these noncompleters will be eligible for help from Pay As You Earn, and I'm sure many will be grateful for it. The fact remains that even in this best-case scenario, noncompleters will still be obligated to fork over one-tenth of their often quite modest incomes to loan servicers. There goes at least half of your wage premium. I know what you're thinking. ""Well, Reihan, the real problem is that college isn't free. If colleges didn't charge tuition, we wouldn't have to worry about student debt."" That's true in the most literal sense. But if the public sector is picking up the tab for higher education, so are all taxpayers, whether they're college-educated or otherwise. Do we have good reason to believe that the federal government will do a great job of whipping colleges into shape if it controls the purse strings? Some smart, thoughtful people, like Sara Goldrick-Rab and Nancy Kendall of the University of Wisconsin, seem to think so. Take a long, hard look at federal programs like Medicare and you might think differently. Granted, there is a strong case that higher education is a public good that generates positive spillovers, which is to say benefits that aren't captured by the individual actually getting the education, and so I definitely think that there is a place for subsidies. Yet there are limits to the subsidize-everything-that-moves strategy. Right now, federal student aid subsidizes attendance at any accredited college at virtually any price. The result is that students have no way of knowing which colleges offer the best bang for the buck, and colleges have little incentive to get better at actually serving their students. By declaring that taxpayers will pay for just about anything labeled ""higher education,"" whether or not it translates into skills that young people can actually use, we have entrenched the worst aspects of the higher education status quo, from wasteful spending to a borderline criminal indifference to the well-being of students--particularly the poorest, most vulnerable students. Consider the findings of Paying for the Party, a masterful account of the many ways life at a large Midwestern flagship public university is rigged against students from working- and lower-middle-class backgrounds. Over the course of five years, the sociologists Elizabeth A. Armstrong and Laura T. Hamilton tracked a group of female students at ""Midwest University,"" a thinly disguised big public flagship school, starting in their freshman year. One of their most striking findings is that standard college advising consistently failed to meet the needs of students from modest backgrounds. Students from affluent backgrounds had extensive social networks at their disposal, which helped them turn degrees in ""party majors"" like sports communication and broadcasting or interior decorating into jobs in glamorous, or glamorous-sounding, fields. Students who didn't have parents familiar with the ins and outs of higher education to help them navigate the system found themselves at the mercy of incompetent, indifferent, and overworked advisers who routinely led them astray. Many of the students profiled by Armstrong and Hamilton thus wasted precious dollars, and precious years, taking courses that ultimately proved useless to them. It was this opportunity cost--the wasted time these young women might have spent learning something useful elsewhere, at a school that actually gave a damn about them--that is the real tragedy at the heart of Paying for the Party. It's not clear that making Midwest University tuition-free would suddenly make its administrators more attentive to the needs of their students. If anything, it might ease what little pressure there is now to offer value for money. So what can we do to address the many ways higher education is failing young Americans? A good first step would be to punish colleges that have failed their students, as Andrew P. Kelly and Alex Pollock of the American Enterprise Institute have suggested. The basic idea is that if a student defaults on her student loans, the higher education institution she attended should pay a penalty. The genius of this idea, as Kelly has explained, is that it would make colleges think twice about their lackluster advising, even if the penalty were quite small. Colleges would suddenly have an excellent reason to guide students to majors that would help them gain marketable skills. The usual objection to this notion of giving colleges more ""skin in the game"" is that colleges would become extremely selective to minimize the risk of default, and this in turn would deny large numbers of students the opportunity to get an education in the first place. The reality is that the vast majority of America's higher education institutions are nonselective, and colleges that refuse to even try to educate students who need competent guidance would quickly find themselves out of business. More broadly, we'd do well to rethink higher education from the ground up. Thinkers like Kelly and New America's Kevin Carey often talk up the importance of breaking down the barriers to entry in higher education--of making it easier for new higher education institutions better-suited to the needs of today's students to get up and running, and to compete with existing colleges that are failing to offer value for money. Anya Kamenetz has gone even further in ""$1 Trillion and Rising: A Plan for a $10K Degree,"" a report from the think tank Third Way that offers a step-by-step roadmap for transforming public higher education. While Kamenetz appreciates the importance of lowering tuition, she emphasizes institutional reforms that would also lower the cost of high-quality instruction. Among other things, she envisions ""cohort colleges"" that offer students who need the most help intensive advising and instruction designed to help them meet their educational goals and short-term pop-up schools that would meet the lifelong learning needs of working students looking to learn specialized skills. Flagship schools, meanwhile, would be transformed from elitist bastions that take pride in their exclusivity to educational innovation hubs, where resources would be devoted not just to teaching students lucky enough to be on campus full time, but also commuters educated at satellite campuses throughout the state. I get why President Obama is talking about student loans. Telling your voters that you want them to keep more of their own money is always a political winner. Just ask every Republican since Jack Kemp. And the president has, to his credit, made occasional noises about reform, most recently when he proposed a new college ratings system, an idea that the higher education lobby has correctly interpreted as a threat to its lucrative incompetence. But he hasn't gone far enough. It is egregious that students, parents, and taxpayers are the ones who suffer when colleges don't do their jobs while the colleges in question are left untouched. We simply can't let them get away with it anymore."	Colleges Should Pay a Fine When Students Default	['Obama']	[]
28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/06/eric_cantor_loses_to_tea_party_s_david_brat_the_house_majority_leader_defeat.html	"Be afraid, be very afraid. In February, a top GOP aide explained why immigration reform was never going to happen this year. ""The Chamber [of Commerce] and downtown [lobbyists] want it, but they're not going to primary anyone."" The fear of a backlash from grass-roots conservatives was hard to predict before Majority Leader Eric Cantor lost in a stunning GOP primary defeat, and it has now become more so. There may be many reasons Cantor, a seven-term incumbent, lost to David Brat, a professor at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Va. Worry among Republicans that he was backing some form of immigration reform that would allow sweeping legalization of the undocumented population was the crystalizing issue. ""I think it's big,"" said Brat. ""It's the most symbolic issue that captures the differences between me and Eric Cantor in this race."" Conservative talk show host Laura Ingraham and other conservative pundits are certainly claiming the victory as a blow to the push for legalization. But suspicion about Cantor's immigration designs might have also morphed with anger that Cantor was trying to have the issue both ways, pretending he was a movement conservative who opposed amnesty and then backing Speaker John Boehner's immigration principles, which those same conservatives saw as a form of amnesty as well authoring his own version of the DREAM Act, to give legal status to young undocumented immigrants. On immigration, he was either wrong or perhaps worse, he was acting just like an insider--squishy on principles. Virginia's GOP primary voters wanted someone who was a consistent conservative. Or maybe it was because Cantor had lost touch with his district and was seen as a backer of Wall Street elites, not middle-class folks. Or maybe people bought Brat's claim that Cantor didn't fight Obama hard enough (the irony being that Obama really dislikes Cantor). Whatever the reasons, the lesson for other Republicans will be clear: If you aren't consistent, doom can come swiftly and unexpectedly. This election season has offered plenty of races where GOP establishment incumbents have swamped grass-roots, movement challengers. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky, Sen. John Cornyn in Texas, for example. And, on the same night Cantor lost, Sen. Lindsey Graham won in South Carolina with 59 percent of the vote. Graham is a stronger supporter of immigration reform and a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants than Cantor, and he was able to survive. But if you are a nervous Republican member of Congress, the lesson you're going to take is the one that keeps you alive: Don't fall out of favor with your activist base. If you do get into trouble, even the traditional weaponry might not save you. Cantor outspent his opponent 20-to-1. Cantor had the power to deliver things to his district. Cantor was seen as next in line to replace John Boehner as speaker of the House, which would have meant even more power and prestige for his district. This is an undiluted version of the lesson being taught in Mississippi where Sen. Thad Cochran's incumbency--and the funnel of federal spending that goes with it--aren't protecting him from a Tea Party challenger. Expensive pollsters aren't going to save you, either. Cantor's told him he was up by 35 points going into the election. Members of the GOP conference who are newly afraid weren't stuffed with great courage in the first place, but remember where we were before Tuesday night. Speaker John Boehner had beaten back the ""hell no caucus"" of conservatives after the government shutdown and given rank-and-file Republican House members a little room to breathe. Boehner slapped back the groups he thought of as grass-roots con men who were opposing the post-shutdown budget deal. ""They're using our members and they're using the American people for their own goals,"" he said. ""This is ridiculous."" Boehner was talking about the groups that claim to speak for the grass-roots, like the Club for Growth and Heritage Action Fund. With those groups scalded, establishment Republicans hoped that Republican members would not be so nervous and follow the strategy promoted by House leaders. Former RNC Chairman and former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour told me that Boehner's public comments were a turning point, giving more common-sense mainstream Republicans control of the reins of the party. Main Street Partnership's Steve LaTourette--whose organization funds moderate Republicans and clashes with Tea Party groups--said the same thing. If the House leadership needed a member to take a tough vote, they could convince him that his fears of being targeted were overblown. Members no longer had to worry as much about well-financed groups with communications departments harnessing grass-roots anger and pointing it at them. The problem is that's not what happened in the Cantor race. Those outside groups didn't play the role in this race that they have in other races that have been labeled as Tea Party vs. Establishment fights. (Though that didn't stop them from pretending they had a hand in Brat's victory.) So the message is the refreshing and reaffirming one that it's the voters who can turn on you. Brat's win will encourage more attempts, and whether the Cantor defeat can be replicated elsewhere doesn't matter. All incumbents will think there are monsters hiding under their beds--and maybe they're right."

29	29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/06/marijuana_legalization_will_weed_soon_be_legal_everywhere_in_the_united.html	"An overwhelming majority of Americans believe that the legalization of marijuana is inevitable. We'll soon find out if they're right. Voters in Alaska and possibly Oregon will decide this November whether their states will join Colorado and Washington in legalizing the commercial sale and recreational use of pot. Similar initiatives are at varying stages in more than a half-dozen other states--Nevada, Arizona, and California among them--where advocates are looking toward 2016, when they hope the presidential election will turn out enough liberals to push those efforts across the finish line. All told, more than 1 in 5 Americans live in states where marijuana use has a legitimate chance to become legal between now and when President Obama leaves office. It's not just at the ballot box where the pro-pot crowd is putting points on the board. Lawmakers in at least 40 states have eased at least some drug laws since 2009, according to a recent Pew Research Center analysis. According to the Marijuana Policy Project, proposals to treat pot like alcohol have been introduced in 18 states and the District of Columbia this year alone. Meanwhile, 16 states have already decriminalized marijuana, according to the pro-pot group NORML--Maryland will become the 17th in October. In large swaths of the country getting caught with a small amount of weed at a concert is now roughly the same as getting a speeding ticket on the way to the show. While not leading the charge, the Obama administration is allowing states the chance to experiment. The feds have given a qualified greenlight to Colorado and Washington to dabble in recreational weed, and have even taken small steps to encourage banks to do business with those companies involved in the quasi-legal pot trade. Given this momentum, it's not difficult to see why 75 percent of Americans--including a majority of both those who support and those who oppose legalization--told Pew pollsters in February that they now believe it's a matter of when, not if, the nation's eight-decade-long prohibition of pot ends. The question is: Are they right? This moment isn't the first time that the United States appeared on the cusp of legalization. After steep gains in popular support during the early and mid-'70s, support for legalization climbed to 30 percent in 1978, only to plummet back into the teens the following decade as Baby Boomers became parents and Jimmy Carter's pro-decriminalization administration gave way to Ronald Reagan's war on drugs. ""This was supposed to be inevitable then,"" says Kevin Sabet, a legalization opponent and former Obama drug policy adviser who helped found Smart Approaches to Marijuana after leaving the administration. ""No one could have predicted that [support] would have been wiped away so quickly."" The pro-pot crowd isn't ready to declare victory either. Ethan Nadelmann, who heads the Drug Policy Alliance and has spent decades in the reform trenches, says he's of two minds when he thinks about the future. ""On the one hand we have this extraordinary momentum,"" he says. ""On the other, public opinion can be fickle and marijuana is not going to legalize itself."" While such caution is reasonable, it's obvious that things are different now than they were 40 years ago, when then-record levels of support for legalization were good for little more than a vocal minority. It wasn't until 2013 that a majority of Americans said for the first time that they supported making it legal to use weed. Support now stands at 54 percent in the most recent Pew poll, 23 points above where the legalization effort stood as recently as 2000 and 13 points higher than in 2010. Even those fickle Baby Boomers are back on board, with 52 percent now in favor--5 points more than that generation's 1970s-era high. Meanwhile, each passing year brings us an electorate more familiar and less fearful of marijuana. It's not just a matter of shifting demographics. There's also the fact that voters have increasingly gotten an up-close look at state-legal weed in the form of medical marijuana. Twenty-one states and the District of Columbia have legalized pot for medicinal purposes to varying degrees since California became the first to do so almost two decades ago. Voters in Florida are set to decide later this year whether they want to join that group, something that would give advocates their first voter-referendum victory in the South. (Florida law requires at least 60 percent support, however, making it a heavier lift than it has been in other states.) Some pot opponents warn that medical marijuana serves as a Trojan Horse for the larger legalization movement, but that argument relies on Americans believing that the dangers of possibly legalizing recreational weed tomorrow outweigh the benefits of actually prescribing it to cancer patients and others in need today--a viewpoint shared by a diminishing number of Americans. While 54 percent of respondents told Pew they thought ""the use of marijuana"" should be made legal, things were more complicated when the question changed from a simple yes-or-no to one where people were asked to pick between three choices: 39 percent said that pot ""should be legal for personal use""; 44 percent said it ""should be legal only for medicinal use""; and 16 percent said it ""should not be legal."" Still, the answers to the original question--""Do you think the use of marijuana should be made legal, or not?""--suggests in an all-or-nothing environment, most Americans choose the former. Regardless, medical marijuana has already served as stepping-stone for states that have or are considering regulating the sale and use of recreational pot. In Colorado, where retail stores opened their doors on New Year's Day, advocates were able to point to the state's tightly regulated medical market, approved by voters in 2000, to allay fears that the state couldn't regulate a marijuana market from scratch. To date, Colorado regulators have delivered on those promises, building a relatively hiccup-free commercial market on the back of the medical marijuana industry. (Things in Washington, where the medical market is unregulated, have proved a good deal more complicated. Residents are still waiting for the first retail stores to open 19 months since the 2012 vote.) Medical marijuana has become so relatively uncontroversial that late last month the House of Representatives shocked almost everyone when a bipartisan majority voted to block the Drug Enforcement Agency from pursuing medical marijuana operations that are legal under state laws. ""Watershed is probably too strong of a word,"" says Nadelmann of the unexpected vote for a bill that had repeatedly stalled in the same chamber for the last decade, ""but it was pretty close."" Legalization in theory is different than legalization in practice, and an unforeseen disaster in Colorado or Washington--be it from the production of hash oil or the next time a New York Times columnist overindulges in baked goods--could always affect public opinion. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat who opposed his state's 2012 legalization initiative, for one, has warned his fellow governors to take a wait-and-see approach to their own state's legalization efforts. But it's looking increasingly like the voters may not be so patient if given the choice."	Could Pot Soon Be Legal Just About Everywhere?	['Obama']	[]
