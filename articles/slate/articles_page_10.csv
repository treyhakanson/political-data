My hope was that Trump would guarantee sky-high ratings for next week's Republican National Convention by selecting a bald eagle, a daring choice that while almost certainly unconstitutional would have delighted and amused Americans of all ages and that would have underscored Trump's commitment to protecting what is arguably our country's most-cherished animal. Instead, reports indicate that Trump has chosen Mike Pence, the not terribly popular governor of Indiana. Many had expected that he would select Newt Gingrich, a skilled if famously shameless communicator who has been one of Trump's ablest and most enthusiastic defenders. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has been auditioning for the VP role for months, though it seems his toadying was just a little too pathetic for Trump's inner circle to countenance. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker was once considered a real possibility, but he publicly withdrew from consideration. The newly minted junior senator from Iowa, Joni Ernst, was also in the mix, but she too demurred. There was talk of Trump selecting Michael Flynn, a little-known retired general and former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, but it all come to naught, perhaps because Flynn, like Trump, has a less than rock-solid track record as a social conservative. One gets the sense that every one of Trump's options was either too ashamed, too insane, too pathetic, or too embarrassingly obscure to run alongside him. Except for Mike Pence. Pence is a drearily conventional figure who had the distinct misfortune of following Mitch Daniels, one of the brightest bulbs in the GOP, as governor of his reliably Republican state. Despite Daniels' long and sturdy coattails, Pence only narrowly defeated his Democratic challenger, John Gregg, in the 2012 gubernatorial race. Some have suggested that Pence was eager to serve as Trump's running mate because he was far from certain that he could defeat Gregg a second time around this fall. Instead of suffering the indignity of an unsuccessful re-election bid, Pence has opted for a higher-profile indignity that might--just might--get him a weekly variety hour on Fox News. Over the course of his long political career--Pence was elected to the House in 2000, where he served until winning the governorship--the Indiana politician has had many deep thoughts. Back in 2006, when then-President George W. Bush was leading the charge for comprehensive immigration reform, Pence devised an ingenious yet almost certainly unworkable amnesty proposal. Essentially, Pence proposed that unauthorized immigrants return to their native countries and then re-enter the United States as ""guest workers."" As guest workers, these women and men would enjoy legal status yet would also be denied various rights and privileges granted to lawful permanent residents. The genius of this proposal, if you can call it that, is that it infuriated every possible constituency: opponents of an amnesty for unauthorized immigrants, conservatives who favor reducing immigration levels, and advocates who want to ensure that poor immigrants are not taken advantage of by unscrupulous employers. I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but one of the biggest reasons Trump won the GOP presidential nomination is that he pledged to strengthen America's borders, oppose amnesty, and reduce immigration levels. My guess is that Pence will endorse every last jot of Trump's immigration agenda. But you have to wonder: Can it really be that Trump couldn't find a running mate who had a clearer, more consistent position on immigration? It doesn't help that Trump's immigration stance is almost brand spanking new. There is at least some good news for Republicans in Pence's selection as VP. Pence has no political future. Had Trump chosen some reasonably together, competent, and appealing candidate, that candidate would have had her or his reputation permanently sullied by the association for years to come. That is not a concern here, at all. See more of Slate's election coverage."	Trump's Apparent VP Pick Is Boring, Incoherent, and Inept. At Least He Has No Political Future.

2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/how_bernie_spent_his_millions_was_anything_but_revolutionary.html	"Bernie Sanders' core pitch to Democratic primary voters was that his people-powered ""revolution"" would make him uniquely positioned to clean up a campaign finance system that most Americans see as hopelessly corrupted. On the strength of this appeal, Sanders raised more than $220 million, and almost 60 percent of those dollars came in the form of small individual donations. A recent analysis by the Los Angeles Times found that about $1 out of every $4 donated to Sanders came from people who aren't in the workforce, including the unemployed or retired. Outside groups supporting Sanders have raised just $610,000, and the only super PAC to offer him significant support this cycle--$3,262,105--was National Nurses United, which is funded from union dues, not the checks of ""millionaires and billionaires,"" as Sanders put it on the stump. But what did that money buy, exactly? Where did all those $27 checks go? A close examination of public records and interviews with campaign finance experts and grass-roots organizers suggests that, in some significant ways, a campaign that took in money like folk bandits wound up spending it like drearily conventional pols. In April, the campaign had a burn rate of 143 percent, meaning it was spending nearly half as much again as it was bringing in. A great deal of that money bought a blast of commercials preceding caucuses and primaries across the country, one effect of which was to enrich a small group of Democratic consultants whose compensation is tied to media spending. Disclosure forms examined by Slate suggest the campaign contracted with a front company--possibly created to obscure who made what off the Sanders movement--and in one cozy arrangement, effectively shared a third-party vendor with a pro-Bernie dark money group. This approach had material, if largely unseen, effects on Sanders' candidacy: Every dollar that went into broadcast ads, digital strategizing, or Democratic consultants' pockets was one less for local campaign staff or get-out-the-vote efforts. Bill Fletcher Jr., a veteran civil rights activist who said he consulted with the Sanders campaign early on but was not directly involved afterward, told Slate that while ""the Sanders campaign is a tremendous movement,"" it was plagued from the beginning by a ""top campaign brass that was very insular"" and didn't take strategic advice from long-time progressive organizers, including some with extensive experience within the communities of color in which Sanders struggled to gain traction. Fletcher doesn't believe Sanders got into the race to win and thinks that running a campaign focused on shifting the center of gravity within the Democratic Party led to serious strategic errors along the way. Key among them was a failure to come up with creative ways to convert millions of supporters' revolutionary zeal into an integrated campaign operation. Some of those errors are reflected in how the campaign chose to spend over $220 million in campaign contributions. * * * The top-billing vendor among all candidates during this campaign cycle is Old Towne Media. Located in a residential home on a leafy suburban street in Alexandria, Virginia, Old Towne Media is, from all outward appearances, a black box. Incorporated as an LLC in 2014, it lists no employees, and its only clients this cycle have been the Sanders campaign and a small PAC supporting an Ohio gubernatorial candidate. A close examination of the Sanders campaign's ad buys suggests that Old Towne Media is a front company for Canal Partners Media, a well-known media firm aligned with the Democratic Party. According to Federal Election Commission data compiled by Open Secrets, Canal Partners Media billed $45 million during the 2014 midterms, half of which came from the Senate campaigns of Mary Landrieu in Louisiana, Michelle Nunn in Georgia, and Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire, the only winner of the three. During this cycle, however, the company has taken in only $515,000 as of May 23. It appears most of its business was shifted into Old Towne, which billed the Sanders campaign $82,773,463 by the end of May. Buying ad time doesn't take rarified skills, but it's a major source of revenue for political consultants--who typically receive a 15 percent commission on ad expenditures for scheduling commercials, negotiating with broadcasters, and settling accounts on behalf of a campaign. Ad buyers are one of a number of businesses that saw a huge surge in revenues during the $2.6 billion 2012 presidential campaign. A study published in May by researchers at Emory University found that in the three most recent election cycles, ""less than 1% of total expenditures by federal candidates for the purpose of purchasing television advertising are paid directly from the campaign committee to a provider."" An examination of 5,800 Sanders ad buy contracts and supporting documentation found that one Canal Partners Media employee, Jeff Scattergood, and two partners, Barbara Abar Bougie and Shelli Hutton-Hartig--all three working as representatives of Old Towne Media--are listed on over 1,000 documents related to air-time purchases for the Sanders campaign. Keeping the different companies' names straight appears to have been difficult, even for the people filling out paperwork for the ad buys. In one document submitted in February, Canal Partners Media was listed as the agent of the Sanders campaign requesting rates for television time from stations in Columbus, Ohio. ""Canal Partners Media (CPM) and Old Towne Media (OTM) are separate companies. There is an overlap between two of the CPM Partners--Barbara Abar Bougie and Shelli Hutton-Hartig--and Old Towne Media,"" Hartig told Slate in an email. ""All Sanders work was done out of OTM and did not involve CPM. For the better part of the last year, Barbara Abar Bougie and I have spent very little time at the CPM offices. To avoid any inadvertent overlap, there has been a strict firewall regarding all operations between OTM and CPM."" Why create a front company at all? One possible explanation relates to another Canal Partners client: Friends of the Earth Action Fund, which made ad buys supporting Sanders in early primary states. Friends of the Earth Action Fund is a 501(c)4 organization, meaning it's a ""dark money"" group that isn't required to disclose its donors. FEC rules prohibit such groups from coordinating with the campaigns they support, but Canal Partners received $20,971 from Friends of the Earth Action; documents acquired by Slate confirm that Canal Partners Media staff made ad buys on behalf of Old Towne Media for the Sanders campaign. Campaigns and independent expenditure groups can use a common vendor, but they can't coordinate in any way and the vendor cannot be a conduit for nonpublic strategic information. Larry Noble, general counsel of the Washington, D.C.-based Campaign Legal Center, said it's possible that Canal Partners set up Old Towne in an attempt to avoid the appearance of coordination between the campaign and independent groups like Friends of the Earth Action. Or maybe the company, mindful of the business it does with more traditional Democrats, ""wanted to separate themselves from the Sanders campaign. Maybe they thought it would hurt their business if they were just working for the Sanders campaign."" By the end of May, the Sanders campaign had spent over $87 million on media production and ad buys, according to FEC records--nearly 40 percent of the funds raised by the campaign. They have spent more on advertising than any other candidate in the 2016 cycle, according to the Wesleyan Media Project. Because of the pay structure of media buying, that yielded an eight-figure payday shared by two firms: Old Towne Media and Devine Mulvey Longabaugh. Tad Devine served as a senior strategist for the Sanders campaign and as president of Devine Mulvey Longabaugh. He was the campaign's more establishment-friendly face, the Paul McCartney to campaign manager Jeff Weaver's John Lennon. Unlike Weaver, whose entire political career had revolved around Sanders, Devine had more skin in Democratic politics than anyone else, perhaps even more than Bernie himself, having worked on a number of presidential campaigns--Al Gore's and John Kerry's among them. This cycle, Devine's firm was paid just under $4.8 million for video and media production services and $438,403 for legal services. Devine also split a commission with Old Towne Media: Friends of the Earth Action is listed as a client of Devine Mulvey Longabaugh on the firm's website. Media buying in politics tended to be a clubby endeavor at odds with Sanders' tendency to hold himself at a monkish remove from campaigning's grubbier aspects. He often portrayed his campaign as being above such unseemly transactions, but in 2005, Vermont Republicans accused Sanders of having steered campaign contracts to members of his family during his 2002 and 2004 House campaigns. According to a 2006 article in Roll Call, Bernie Sanders' wife, Jane Sanders, and stepdaughter, Carina Driscoll, were paid $95,000 for ad-buy placement, database administration, and miscellaneous consulting services during those campaigns. Such arrangements are legal, but in 2005, Larry Noble, then-executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, told the Montpellier Times-Argus, ""It's a form of self-dealing and anytime you're involved with self-dealing, questions are going to be raised."" When it became an issue in 2006, Jane Sanders stopped taking commissions, and her husband's campaign started steering ad buys through a firm called Abar Hutton, which was founded by Barbara Abar Bougie and Shelli Hutton-Hartig. Ten years later, Bougie's name appears on multiple ad contracts for Old Towne Media, and the suburban house where the firm is located is owned by David Hartig and Shelli Hutton-Hartig, according to public records. * * * Was the Sanders campaign wise to invest so much in advertising? Travis Ridout, a professor of government and public policy at Washington State University who studies political media, said that Sanders ""is a candidate for whom advertising might have actually been effective, first for introducing himself to a lot of people, and also for political donors to see all those ads on the air. That lent him quite a bit of viability."" But Jason McDaniel, a political scientist at San Francisco State University, told Slate: ""We know that campaign ads tend to have minimal effects on persuasion and turnout. Whatever effect they do have is short term, fading away after several days at best. In the largest states, a campaign may not have the time and resources to build up an effective voter contact operation, so an ad blitz may make the most sense. But in many states, resources might be better used for canvassing or get-out-the-vote operations."" It's not uncommon for political consultants who get a fat commission from ad buys to become the tail that wags the dog of a campaign's spending priorities. Peskowitz, a political scientist at Emory University, said: ""The interests of political consultants and the candidate they work for can sometimes be in conflict with one another. The standard business model in this industry is that consultants--media consultants in particular--take a percentage off the top for themselves. Media consultants might be willing to spend more money on advertising than might be optimal from the perspective of the candidate."" Previous reporting on Devine's share of the campaign's ad buys have understated his take. ""While he usually gets a double-digit percentage of a campaign's ad spending, the veteran admaker is instead splitting a single-digit-percentage commission with the media buyers at Old Towne Media,"" the Washington Post reported in April, summarizing an interview with Devine. But several hundred Sanders ad buy disclosures filed with the Federal Communications Commission and reviewed by Slate show the campaign consistently paid the industry standard 15 percent commission, meaning that Old Towne and Tad Devine shared at least $10 million in commissions through the end of May. Tad Devine did not return a call from Slate seeking his comment on this story Another vendor, Revolution Messaging, received disbursements of over $28 million from the Sanders campaign for digital consulting and ad buys. Technology experts debate how much digital strategy should be kept in-house, but most agree that it makes sense to contract out some functions to innovative firms. But a leader of a New York-based, pro-Sanders volunteer group (who asked for anonymity because he was still working with the campaign) told Slate that its tech operation wasn't as impressive as some reports have suggested. ""You can't say, 'Oh, look at all this innovation that the Bernie Sanders campaign has pioneered.' They used the existing tools that were available,"" he said. ""The most significant technological achievement of the campaign was to get volunteers to use Slack."" The organizer, who said he spent almost a year working full-time to promote Sanders' movement, told Slate, ""The extent to which this campaign was not innovative, but actually did the traditional kind of campaigning ... that's kind of the hidden side of things."" He said that the campaign failed to take full advantage of the grass-roots ""revolution"" it sparked. One of the myriad volunteer groups that sprang up across the country, People for Bernie, which was organized by veterans of the Occupy movement, claimed to have generated more than 2.5 billion engagements online. People for Bernie said activists organized over 150 events ""around the country before the official campaign had an events tool,"" and that ""the people from those events formed the backbone of volunteer run efforts across the country."" But after the New York organizer and his team spent months canvassing, they went to the campaign with their voter data--which Sanders' paid staffers didn't integrate into their own database. ""Not only didn't they have staffing in place in most states until like three or four weeks before [the vote],"" the organizer said, ""but they also didn't have staffing at headquarters who were in charge of dealing with the massive grassroots energy that was taking place in states. So, OK, maybe you haven't hired staff in New York three months out, but at least have someone for us to talk to, so that we can be coordinated and seamlessly transition from a volunteer-based operation to working closely with paid campaign staff. And I would say that was a point of failure for the campaign not just once, but again and again."" Hillary Clinton wound up winning the New York primary by an unexpectedly wide margin, and afterward the Sanders campaign took on a funereal air. Asked what he thought of consultants like Devine making a small fortune on the campaign, while he and his fellow volunteers toiled for nothing, the organizer said he had no personal regrets. But it did make him wonder about certain, ah, structural inequalities in the system: ""This is [a] situation where the average donation is less than $30, yet there's a consultant making [millions]. I think the question has to be posed: How many $27 donations went to Tad Devine, and do those people think that was worth it?"" Bernie Sanders proved that you can raise hundreds of millions from small donors and run a competitive campaign against a well-financed opponent who enjoys incumbent-like support within the party. But running a national campaign is a big, inherently institutional affair, and it turns out that it's easier to run against the establishment and rail about its perfidy than it is to escape the habits of its campaign apparatus. The Sanders insurgency democratized fundraising in such a way, and to such an extent, that he could forswear the usual compromising relationships with super PACs and major donors. This was the nature of his revolution. But a presidential campaign, like any American institution, has structures in place to preserve the status quo. In this way, the Sanders campaign itself was a parable about the country it was trying to change. The New York organizer paused briefly, as if choosing his words carefully. The campaign, he said, wasn't ""consistent with the idea that there's a new kind of politics represented by ... Bernie. You can either buy that much media and say you're running a traditional campaign, or you cannot do that and say you're running an innovative campaign. But I don't think you can do both at the same time."" This article was reported in partnership with the Investigative Fund at the Nation Institute.

3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/the_democratic_platform_is_a_monument_to_bernie_sanders_campaign.html	"On Tuesday, Bernie Sanders will join Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire, the state that supercharged his insurgent candidacy and gave him a shot at the nomination. There, according to reports, they will campaign together. After weeks of waiting, the Vermont senator will endorse Clinton as the nominee of the Democratic Party. He'll do so with his influence, and his leverage, intact. Last month, I wrote that Sanders was losing his leverage--that Clinton's consolidation of liberal voters and Democratic Party actors had worn down his ability to pull the party to the left. That assessment, rooted in Clinton's rapid ascent against Donald Trump in national polling, was wrong. Instead, through tight marshaling of his supporters and delegates, Sanders waged a successful fight to produce the most liberal Democratic platform in a generation. The draft platform, produced this weekend at a meeting of Clinton and Sanders delegates in Orlando, Florida, still needs to be ratified at the Democratic National Convention. And there, delegates can make amendments and change provisions. But even with that caveat, this document represents a victory for Sanders and his backers, with planks that reflect the aims of his campaign. What did he win? Included in the new platform is his call for a $15 per hour minimum wage, Social Security expansion, a carbon tax to price its impact on the environment, tough language on Wall Street reform and antitrust, opposition to the death penalty, and a ""reasoned pathway for future legalization"" of marijuana. That's not to call this an unqualified success. Clinton delegates blocked a Sanders-favored fracking ban, a ""Medicare for all"" plank, a call for public financing of elections, an amendment to block lobbyists from serving as regulators (and vice versa), and language that would commit Democrats to pushing ""an end to occupation and illegal settlements"" in Palestinian territory. On the whole, however, Sanders won more than he lost, especially given the degree to which the two sides were more simpatico than aligned against each other. Indeed, for as much as coverage emphasized discord between Clinton and Sanders delegates, the real story is the extent to which the entire party has moved to the left, with broad agreement on most issues. Team Clinton and Team Sanders moved in tandem on a whole host of concerns, such as a police-reform plank that committed the party against police militarization and racial profiling (as well as supporting the use of body cameras), ""postal banking"" that expands banking services to low-income Americans, an end to loopholes for estates and hedge funds, and a stronger Earned Income Tax Credit. Even where Sanders lost, he still received something close to his aim. Democrats approved a fracking plank that backed additional regulations from local, state, and federal government, and Clinton herself endorsed a ""public option"" for the Affordable Care Act, widely seen as a possible step toward a single-payer health care system. When it was all over, both sides were satisfied. ""We are proud of the work that Democrats did in Orlando and for coming together to further strengthen the most progressive platform in the history of our party,"" said Clinton senior policy adviser Maya Harris on Saturday. ""I think if you read the platform right now, you will understand that the political revolution is alive and kicking,"" said Sanders policy director Warren Gunnells to NBC News. There's a big asterisk in all of this: Historically, party platforms haven't mattered for presidential candidates or presidential campaigns. At best, they are guideposts for future movement. More often than not, they're irrelevant--unenforceable documents that fall inevitably into the ash bin of history. Even that asterisk, however, requires an asterisk. If platforms don't matter, it's in part because party players act as such. But those figures can act differently, and when they do, those documents take on new significance. That Bernie Sanders has emphasized the platform--that Hillary Clinton has followed suit, with involvement from Team Obama--is a strong sign that it matters. And while it might not shape a Clinton White House--whose movement, like all administrations', is shaped by contingency and opportunity as much as by ideology and strategy--it provides a hook for activists and a basis for further demands. Liberal interests and other groups can measure the Democratic Party's actions against its stated principles and demand accountability when they fall short. And political innovators within Democratic politics--people like Bernie Sanders, for instance--can use the platform as a starting point for pushing the boundaries of the status quo. If nothing else, this platform emphasizes the extent to which 2016 isn't a year to move to the center. Barring a dramatic shift in Donald Trump himself, Democrats and Republicans will fight the fall election on questions of identity. What kind of country do we have, and who is it for? It's an election where policy and ideology play a role but aren't at center stage. For liberals and progressives, it's an incredible opportunity to move beyond the Obama administration and its modest steps to the left. Judging from the platform, they're going to take it.

John McCain had a bad day on June 16, which means that Stephen Sebastian had a good one. McCain was speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill several days after the Orlando nightclub shooting and assigned blame for the incident where he saw fit. ""Barack Obama is directly responsible for it,"" he said, ""because when he pulled everybody out of Iraq, al-Qaida went to Syria, became ISIS, and ISIS is what it is today thanks to Barack Obama's failures."" McCain has frequently argued that Obama made a strategic blunder in carrying out the 2011 withdrawal of Iraq. He believes this. But the personalization of his criticism during a tragic and toxic week in American social and political life seemed incongruously aggressive for the moment. His communications department soon set about cleaning up the remarks. ""I misspoke,"" the senator said in a press release issued several hours later. ""I did not mean to imply that the President was personally responsible. I was referring to President Obama's national security decisions, not the President himself."" Why the clarification and the additional scrutiny that invites? McCain is up for re-election this year, and he can't just throw raw meat to the base as he did in 2010, when all he had to do was get through his primary. Arizona was a safely red state then, and his Democratic competition that autumn was little more than token. The task is more delicate this time. He has a legitimate challenger in Kelli Ward, a former Arizona state senator whom he can't write off ahead of the Aug. 30 primary, and the Arizona GOP's Trump-inflamed hard-right flank is eager to get another shot at him. His general election competition, assuming he gets that far, is anything but token: He is going up against Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, a sitting member of Congress who knows what it's like to run in tight, expensive races. Demographic trends have already numbered Arizona's days as a safe red state. Democrats hope that Donald Trump is the catalyst they need to hustle the state into their column. That night, at an event in Phoenix, Stephen Sebastian was beaming. Sebastian is Ward's communications director. He'd been out of pocket at another event earlier in the day when news broke of McCain's comments. After he checked his phone and saw it blowing up, he scrambled to put out a statement. I saw his handiwork in Phoenix, a gleefully acerbic effort with the headline, ""WARD: McCain 'Directly Responsible' for ISIS."" In no way did Sebastian seem nervous that the sentiment might be received as a step too far in response to McCain's own overreach, and Ward herself would later read the statement aloud to a table of Tea Partiers. ""As we got used to during his 2008 presidential campaign, John McCain has once again thrown a punch at Barack Obama and immediately apologized for it, bowing to lick the boots of the political correctness police--Not surprising for the ultimate establishment insider,"" the statement read. ""I, however, am not afraid to place the blame right where it belongs: John McCain is 'directly responsible' for the rise of ISIS."" It was a Trumpian statement. On policy, it hit the Republican establishment on the ""globalist"" policies with which the nationalist Trump wing of the party takes issue--nation-building abroad, open borders at home. More important to Ward's campaign and a frustrated element of conservatives than the substance of the complaint, though, was the style: She had thrown a nasty punch that elites would likely tut-tut, and she would stand by it. As we saw with Trump, saying something controversial, not backing down, and getting away with it is just as central to earning the support of Republican hard-liners as the content itself. John McCain learned this firsthand a year ago. As the Ward camp hit McCain for exemplifying everything Republican presidential primary voters had rejected by nominating Trump, the Kirkpatrick campaign criticized McCain for his reckless Trumpism. ""Elected leaders have a moral duty to work together to root out terrorism and keep Americans safe,"" the Kirkpatrick campaign's statement read. ""But today, we saw John McCain cross a dangerous line in comments that undermine our Commander in Chief on national security issues--at the very moment the president was in Orlando to comfort victims' families. It's difficult to imagine the old John McCain being this reckless with something so serious. John McCain has changed after 33 years in Washington."" On the Kirkpatrick campaign's website, the statement is squeezed between two other news releases connecting McCain to Trump. Could John McCain lose? By his own admission, yes. ""If Donald Trump is at the top of the ticket, here in Arizona, with over 30 percent of the vote being the Hispanic vote, no doubt that this may be the race of my life,"" McCain said at a private event in early May. The polling in neither his primary nor his prospective general election matchup is all that cushy. Trump's position at the top of the ticket gives his rivals on the right and the left a feeling that this is the cycle in which their respective prophecies will be met. Immigration hard-liners in this hot-tempered border state--""the crazies"" of whom McCain once spoke--hope Trump's triumph is the sign from God that this is the year they'll retire McCain through a primary. Democrats see McCain's defeat at the hands of Kirkpatrick as the herald of tomorrow's blue Arizona, a state whose politics will be shaped by the growing Latino share of the electorate. Each camp may be more given to wish-casting than it admits. The right-wing resistance to McCain in Arizona has earned plenty of national press over the years, but it's never proven to be more than a vocal minority. And Democratic hopes of turning Arizona blue now sound an awful lot like Democratic hopes of turning Texas blue did a couple of years ago. Neither of these threats is catching McCain by surprise, and both the campaign he's assembled and the candidate it's tasked with re-electing are skilled operators. He is running a tight, merciless campaign, one at odds both with the caricature of McCain as a hopeless old fud and with the spontaneity of his campaigns of yore. This is John McCain, in a bind partly of his own devising, doing what he needs to do to squeeze another six years out of history. The Primary: Chemtrail Kelli and the Woodchipper At 6:30 p.m. on June 16, the weather was cooling to a balmy 100 degrees outside the Quality Inn Phoenix Airport. That's where Kelli Ward and a handful of other politicians running for lower offices had convened for a meet-and-greet with members of the Ahwatukee Tea Party. Ward, 47, is from Lake Havasu City on the state's western border. She represented the area in the state Senate for three years before turning full-time to her campaign against the most famous Republican officeholder in the country. Lake Havasu is home to London Bridge, built in the 1830s, which a businessman purchased from the city of London in 1968 and subsequently had rebuilt block-by-block. It is also a popular regional spring break destination. ""It's our Daytona Beach,"" as one Arizona operative put it to me. ""That's the politest way of saying it."" Lake Havasu City is very conservative. So is Ward, and so were the 20 or so local Tea Party members who showed up that night in Phoenix. Ward doesn't have the advertising budget or the support from outside groups that the senior senator from Arizona does. National groups that have funded conservative primary challengers in the past and had their eye on McCain this year, such as the Senate Conservatives Fund or the Club for Growth, have so far demurred from signing on with Ward. With so much of her campaign cash already spent on building up an organization, Ward advertises the old-fashioned way: meeting voters one by one, at as many events as possible, even if only a handful of people show up. Ward is warm and eager to impress, always smiling even when she's releasing a punch. She speaks rapidly, without pause for breathing, as she gives the elevator pitch to conservative voters around the state who know they may not like McCain but haven't a clue who his opponents are. She drops her endorsements less to boast than to signal her ideological allegiances--Phyllis Schlafly, Chris McDaniel, Ron Paul, Mark Levin--and mentions approximately every 20 words that she's a ""military wife,"" as important a biographical plank as any in a race against the country's most famous veteran. Ward also doesn't let slide McCain's election-season appeal to his own military credentials as a signifier of foreign policy know-how. ""John McCain was in the military,"" she explained to me, but ""he was never a commander in the military, that I know of. He was never somebody that was making strategy."" (It's a softer version of Trump's infamous reference to McCain's five-and-a-half-year captivity in North Vietnam. ""He's not a war hero,"" Trump said. ""He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured."") Ward's is an insurgency with the flavor of its native state. She mixes in typical sloganeering about how ""it's time to retire John McCain,"" who is ""not the conservative he claims to be,"" with more colorful jingles: ""I am ready to mix the mortar to fix the border!"" she would say the following day at a roundtable in Prescott. ""I have a question that's important to me and the 27,000 readers of my website,"" said one attendee at the Tea Party event. Middle-aged and sporting long, damp, curly locks reminiscent of Rick James, the man wore a T-shirt on which ""ISIS"" had been crossed out, with a bomb instead of a dot atop the second I. Next to that graphic was a likeness of Donald Trump, holding a gun from the business end of which erupted a mushroom cloud. Above Trump it read ""I'VE JIHAD IT!"" and beneath all of this, finally, came the quote, ""We're gonna knock the hell out of ISIS."" His question was whether Ward supports Donald Trump. Ward is on board with Trump, but she has her qualms. Like Trump, she's a border hawk; she goes so far as to support ""turning off"" immigration until ""we find the people here illegally."" A closer analog to her conservatism, though, would be Sen. Ted Cruz, and she gushes about the possibility of serving with him. Like Cruz, she's leery of the trade protectionist planks of Trump's campaign, and she hopes in the Senate to provide a check on Trump's extra-constitutional impulses. She's also spoken out and introduced statewide legislation against National Security Agency mass surveillance programs on Fourth Amendment grounds. Breaks from mainstream Republican orthodoxy like the latter expose Ward to the largess of mainstream Republican donors. McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, is running a campaign focused on national security, which suits his purposes in primary and general election terrains. A hawk if ever there was one, McCain--who spent the Fourth of July with the troops in Afghanistan and fretted about a deficit of soldier deployments there--doesn't have time for reforms that might even marginally handcuff the country's surveillance capabilities. And he believes that a majority of voters won't, either, after the attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando. He's probably not wrong about that. At both the Tea Party meeting and the coffee shop roundtable in Prescott the next day, one of the first things the assembled voters wanted to know was: What was all the stuff they were hearing about Ward--those ads that pop up whenever they're watching Fox News, those pamphlets that keep turning up in their mail? Was it true? In Prescott, one woman brought in a mailer she'd received and handed it to the candidate. Ward laughed; this wasn't the first time someone had shown it to her. Atop the mailer were the words ""RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORIST ATTACKS"" in a chilling typeface. Beneath it was a map marking Paris, Boston, San Bernardino, and Phoenix. A check mark appeared next to the first three cities, while Phoenix bore a question mark. ""THE THREAT IS REAL. THE THREAT IS GROWING,"" it said. ""And Kelli Ward's dangerous national security policies would make the threat even greater."" ""This is the nicest one they've sent out,"" Ward's mother, Lorraine Byrd, who travels with her daughter on the trail, said to me. Who is ""they""? The assault on Ward is a joint production from the McCain campaign and, in the case of this flier, an entity known as Arizona Grassroots Action. Naturally, Arizona Grassroots Action is a pro-McCain super PAC based out of Alexandria, Virginia, whose major donors include former WWE CEO and Connecticut Senate candidate Linda McMahon, billionaire Ron Perelman, and finance titans Paul Singer and Gregory Wendt. It shares an office address, according to Federal Election Commission filings, with Friends of John McCain Inc.--the official McCain campaign committee. The two entities are ""segregated"" from each other, the McCain campaign insists. But let's at least posit that the necessities of battle have led McCain far from the high-minded forbearance of his McCain-Feingold days. Ward laughs off the charges as ridiculous--and they are, though well within the norm of political campaigning--and she thanks McCain for helping to build up her name recognition. The McCain campaign would use a more traditional term for what they're doing: defining its opponent. Or as the armchair mercenary operatives would call it in private: killing its opponent. The McCain campaign made a legendary killing of its last right-wing primary opponent, J.D. Hayworth, in 2010. Hayworth was a television personality who parlayed that into a 12-year stint in Congress, after which he returned to the airwaves. As a talk radio host he was deeply critical of McCain, especially over McCain's work with Sen. Ted Kennedy on immigration reform. McCain's associates took umbrage and tried to get Hayworth off the air by filing complaints with the radio station. That backfired. ""To some extent, [they] almost pushed him off the air and into the race,"" recalls Jason Rose, an Arizona consultant who served as a senior adviser to Hayworth's campaign until spring 2010. This was the year of the Tea Party wave, and for a while, Hayworth was able to keep his head above water amid a $20 million-plus bombardment from McCain. That June the press ""discovered"" certain infomercials Hayworth had starred in. As pitchman for the National Grants Conference, Hayworth urged viewers to sign up for seminars that would teach them how to get grant money from the federal government--or, as the on-screen text read, ""FREE MONEY."" From the government! The production aesthetic of the infomercials is recognizable as ""obvious screeching scam."" As Talking Points Memo reported at the time, the company had received an F from the Better Business Bureau and complaints from 32 state attorneys general. Rose--who supports McCain this year--recalls catching up with a McCain staffer from the 2010 campaign a couple of years ago to swap war stories. ""There was a lot of concern about J.D.,"" the staffer told him, ""but then they got a tip about what really turned that race ... they uncovered this video."" Rose remembers talking to Hayworth's campaign manager at the time: ""And he said something like, 'Yeah, J.D. thought that might be a problem.' "" McCain won the primary by 24 points. If McCain prevails in the primary, we can be pretty sure what the defining kill shot was, the two words by which everyone remembers the 2016 Arizona Republican Senate primary. Chemtrail Kelli. In June 2014, Ward, then a state senator, convened a hearing with members of the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality to address, among other things, constituent concerns about ""chemtrail"" conspiracy theories. Chemtrails are a genre of conspiracy theory unto themselves; the gist is that jet contrails don't simply consist of water vapor byproducts, but also of chemical agents being sprayed onto an unsuspecting public for nefarious purposes such as altering human behavior. A lot of people in Ward's district had been concerned about blood tests they'd been receiving, and rumors began circulating. There's no evidence that Ward bought into these rumors. Ward's introductory remarks, which she gave before ceding the stage to experts, are actually sort of funny. She searches for the right euphemism for the conspiracists who've clearly been annoying the hell out of her and her office about this, and she settles on ""relentless"" before quickly adding, ""That's not a bad thing!"" Her constituents were worried, and Ward felt it was her duty to hold a public information session, no matter how absurd the concerns. ""The only people who would make a story out of that,"" she told me, ""are the political elite, who don't think you need to respond to constituents concerns, and the media who love to hype things up because it brings readership."" The press labeled her a conspiracy theorist at the time, and now the McCain campaign and its super PAC, with their piles of cash, have revived the story. ""CHEMTRAIL KELLI FUELS CONSPIRACY THEORIES AT TAXPAYER EXPENSE,"" a spot from Friends of John McCain blares out, while an ad from the campaign's super PAC officemate spells a number of complaints about Ward in contrail skywriting. ""They say politics is like being put through a wringer,"" Ward said at the Ahwatukee Tea Party event, ""but really it's a woodchipper."" She then pointed out something I had missed. Among the 20 or so people at the event, there was one other relatively young person who wasn't a reporter or a candidate. Dressed in a plaid button-down, he'd come to the event late and didn't say much to anyone. After sitting at a roundtable with Ward, he typed some notes on his phone and left early. He was a tracker, and he had been recording the event with his phone, only the tip of which was visible from his shirt pocket. One of Ward's great frustrations is that she can't get McCain in a one-on-one. There are two other weaker-polling candidates on the ballot, Alex Meluskey and perennial gadfly Clair Van Steenwyk, both of whom Ward has repeatedly urged to get out of the race since they're just diluting the opposition to McCain. There are rumors in right-wing Arizona circles that associates of McCain are covertly propping up Meluskey's campaign for this reason, rumors that both Ward's communications director and Ward herself passed on to me, even while noting that the relationship is ""impossible to prove."" McCain's spokeswoman, Lorna Romero, dismisses these rumors as paranoia. ""It's shocking that she would even allege something like that,"" Romero says. If Ward goes down, even in a state with so much right-wing rage at McCain, the explanation needn't stretch into conspiracy. McCain has done this before; he has money, and he's not taking his opponent lightly, even if she's not nearly as well-known as him. These are experienced political professionals, and it's not a coincidence that McCain drew Ward as his main primary challenger instead of, say Reps. Matt Salmon or Dave Schweikert, two conservative recruits who declined to run. ""They knew that [McCain] was taking this as the race of his life,"" says Sean Noble, an Arizona operative and former chief of staff to Rep. John Shadegg. ""They saw the numbers as well as he did. They took a pass for a reason."" The General: Ann Kirkpatrick and the Vault Just southeast from downtown Phoenix and across the river from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport rests Tempe, a city of 168,000 people that's home to Arizona State University. A short walk from the campus is an old bank building that looks abandoned from the outside but inside is teeming with a dozen or so young people making calls and chatting in the open atrium where customers once queued to speak to tellers. The old bank now serves as headquarters for Kirkpatrick for Senate, where these young employees are trying to win a U.S. Senate race for an Arizona Democrat for the first time in 28 years. ""Let's show you the vault,"" Kirkpatrick's communications director, D.B. Mitchell, told me when I visited. The vault has been converted into a room for opposition research on John McCain. Inside the foot-thick door--which, I was told, had been rejiggered to ensure that it can't be locked shut, trapping hapless staffers inside--were two computers used solely for digging through McCain's career in politics and the forgotten iterations of his picaresque journey. A rotation of staffers and interns, amply supplied by the massive public university down the street, sit in the vault and rummage through McCain's many previous lives. ""One of our interns was watching footage of a 1999 presidential debate"" between McCain and Bush, Kirkpatrick campaign manager Max Croes was saying in his office, ""and said to me, 'Did you know there was this guy named Bill Bradley who ran against Al Gore?' "" If young people, even ones interning for Democratic political campaigns, can't remember a major Democratic figure from the late 1990s, how much have they never known about McCain? And how much has everyone else forgotten? Do people remember, for instance, the McCain who was once something other than an establishment, Chamber of Commerce Republican? Do they remember his brush with scandal in the 1980s as a member of the so-called Keating Five? His reinvention over the next decade as a campaign finance reform prophet and an unpredictable vote, a good-government ""maverick"" who made an uncomfortable habit of calling out party leaders' wasteful spending projects? Surely they remember the McCain who added to all of the above a thirst for military adventurism and who by 2000 became, in his mind, a sort of latter-day Teddy Roosevelt. This was the man who for a fleeting moment looked as if he might wrest the nomination from establishment favorite George W. Bush and who finally earned his turn as the party's nominee in 2008. It's incredible to think now that McCain was ever the one who gave Republican leaders headaches. Right now that title belongs to Sens. Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, and Rand Paul and roughly one-sixth of the House Republican Conference, while McCain is just the guy trying to push appropriations bills through. The Tea Party would have come about anyway after Sen. Barack Obama beat McCain in 2008. But don't forget, either, that it was McCain who that year enabled the anarchic right by rushing Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin onto the national scene. Even today he will not speak negatively in public about his choice of Palin for vice president. The Tea Party turned hard against mainstream conservatives like McCain, while McCain, in first lunging to the cranky right to win re-election in 2010 and thereafter settling into his role as a party man, lost some of the shine on his halo among independents. Now here he is today, just throwing money at super PACs and telling them to get rid of his problem. Arizona Democrats, noting McCain's sagging popularity, had their eye on him this cycle even before it was known that Republican primary voters would make an immense in-kind contribution to the Democratic cause by nominating Donald Trump for the presidency. In 2014, a survey from the left-leaning Public Policy Polling found McCain to be the ""least popular senator in the country""; McCain referred to this as ""bogus."" In a May PPP survey (commissioned by progressive group MoveOn, as McCain's campaign likes to point out), McCain's overall approval rating sat underwater at 34 percent to 52. ""Everyone in Arizona has a story about how John McCain's been an asshole to them,"" Democratic consultant Andy Barr says. The Kirkpatrick campaign's message to those who do remember McCain's popular ""maverick"" iteration is that he's changed, while the message to younger voters is that he's always been this bad. And the message to everyone is that John McCain supports Donald Trump's candidacy. Not a single Arizona Republican operative I spoke with would describe McCain's support of Trump as anything other than a political necessity. He's just doing what he needs to do. But it's not good enough, Democrats say, for McCain to say he supports the nominee--even after having been personally insulted last year--but then to keep his distance and act as if they're wholly separate entities. He can't have it both ways. In the age of Trump, he can't be the loyal Republican soldier and the independent-minded center-right ally of Hispanic communities. Kirkpatrick, 66, is familiar with tight elections. She won her first race in Arizona's 1st Congressional District in 2008 in a year that was horrific for Republicans all around, but especially in that district. The congressman she was seeking to replace, Rep. Rick Renzi, didn't run for re-election due to his 35-count indictment involving various shady investment deals and acts of political corruption. Kirkpatrick won the district by 16 percentage points that year, a luxury she's never enjoyed since. She lost the seat in the next election to Rep. Paul Gosar then retook it in a 2012 squeaker after the district was redrawn and Gosar had moved to the 4th District. She narrowly won re-election in a brawl of a 2014 campaign that, with total expenditures of $17 million, was one of the most expensive House races in the country. Arizona's 1st Congressional District is enormous. Covering roughly half the state, it includes the Hopi, Navajo, and Apache reservations to the northeast and stretches west to gobble up Flagstaff--where Kirkpatrick is from--and the Grand Canyon. At the bottom it extends southwest to include the Sonoran exurbs south of Phoenix. Running campaigns in this district is good preparation for a statewide campaign: It requires advertising in the Phoenix, Flagstaff, and Tucson media markets; strong relationships with Native Americans; and an intricate knowledge of rural communities dotted across the terrain. ""It's like running for mayor of a million different small towns,"" Sean Noble says. But running in Arizona's 1st District isn't perfect preparation for running a statewide race. The shape of the district suggests a curious lumbering giant who approaches major population centers, sees all the people, and holds back. About 70 percent of the votes in Arizona are in Maricopa County--the blue city of Phoenix, phalanxed by the deep red suburbs of Mesa, Gilbert, Scottsdale, and Glendale--and Pima County (i.e., Tucson). It's these consistently fast-growing, demographically shifting hubs that Kirkpatrick has never had to win before where her bid against McCain will either be won or lost. Kirkpatrick announced her Senate candidacy in May 2015, when the political world still saw Donald Trump's dabbling with a presidential run as little more than his quadrennial play for attention. I asked Kirkpatrick what prompted her to give up her congressional seat for a ploy so risky as challenging McCain. ""I did a Democratic precinct analysis, and I looked at the underperforming Democratic areas of Arizona,"" she says, ""and I realized that's where we have to focus, and that's where we have to perform."" She looked at Richard Carmona's race against Sen. Jeff Flake in 2012--a wake-up call for the Arizona Republican Party--in which Carmona lost by only 3 percentage points. ""I said, OK, where do we pick up those 90,000 votes? And how do we do that? And once I figured that out, I was like, 'We can do this.' "" The precincts she was looking at were largely in the Phoenix and Tucson areas. Registering tens of thousands of new voters, and then ensuring that those voters turn out, is the Arizona election year goal for Mi Familia Vota, a national nonprofit that promotes civic engagement among Latino communities. It has two offices in Maricopa and one in Tucson. Francisco Heredia, MFV's national field director, walked me through its efforts at his office in Phoenix. The first phase of its program, from January through May, was to help legal permanent residents apply for citizenship ahead of the election, a four- to five-month process. The second phase, going on now, is to register the new citizens, and the third phase is to turn out the vote. Much of Arizona's voting is done by mail. The solidly Republican state government in 2007 passed a law allowing for permanent early (or absentee) voting, Heredia says, because at the time it believed such a system was beneficial to Republicans. As state demographics shifted and it turned out that easier access to the ballot only helped Democrats, the legislature determined that voter fraud was a very serious threat. One of MFV's practices in the past had been to collect the mailed ballots of Latino voters with whom it had built trust and ensure that the ballots were turned in. In March of this year, though, the state government passed a law making ""ballot harvesting,"" as it's known, a felony. ""The legislature, led by Republicans, really created this environment that there is voter fraud happening, when there's nothing going on,"" Heredia says. A 2013 analysis from the Arizona Republic found a total of 34 voter fraud cases since 2005 in Maricopa County. Kirkpatrick's task, like the tasks of all Senate and House challengers in competitive races this year, is to fuse her Republican opponent with Donald Trump. In Arizona doing so would allow her to maximize Latino and youth turnout--there's some overlap between the two, as the average age of Latinos in Arizona is mid-20s while for whites it's mid-40s--and sway more traditional swing voters. It's among those traditional swing voters where a female candidate helps. ""Basically, the entire swing demographic in Arizona is white suburban women,"" says Andy Barr. ""There's not much else in the swing demo."" But the electoral pivot of the race, as Democrats see it, is the young Latino voter, who they believe could inaugurate the bluing of Arizona, given sufficient turnout. The share of Latinos as a percentage of the Arizona vote has increased from single digits in the 1990s to 12 percent in 2004, 16 percent in 2008, and 18 percent in 2012. Arizona Democrats are hoping for 18 to 20 percent this cycle. Will that be enough? Rep. Ruben Gallego, a freshman member of Congress representing a safe Democratic district in Phoenix, thinks the magic number is still 18 percent of the vote. Anecdotally, at least, what he's hearing in his district is that new, young Latino voters who don't have a relationship with McCain are viewing him as an extension of Trump. ""Latinos are now seeing McCain and Trump as one and the same,"" he says, ""and even tying things that your average voter would not normally tie together. For example: John McCain not supporting the president's Supreme Court pick? In their minds, from what I'm hearing, it's telling them that he wants Trump to pick the next Supreme Court justice. So it's just starting to jell together."" (The Kirkpatrick campaign has been flogging the Merrick Garland obstruction hard as part of its ""McCain has changed"" effort.) Republican operatives, even ones who think that Arizona will eventually turn blue, just don't see this as the year. Eighteen or 20 percent isn't high enough, and McCain, though damaged goods, is still too strong of a brand for Trump to drag down. ""I believe that's likely the case""--that Arizona turns blue due to demographics--""sometime in the 2020s,"" Noble says. ""The demographics just aren't moving fast enough, because even though the population has increased, they just don't turn out."" Mike Madrid, a Sacramento, California-based GOP consultant who studies Latino voter trends and has warned the GOP about its rhetoric toward communities of color, believes that poor voter turnout plus McCain's far better-than-average numbers among Latinos won't even make this close. Sure, he says, McCain's numbers among Latinos have dipped over the course of his re-election campaigns--but it's been gradual, and his peak was really, really high. He says it's not ""likely"" they fall beneath 40 percent, even with Trump atop the ticket. ""McCain is the Republican elected official that has done the best with Latino/Hispanic voters [of] any candidate in history,"" Madrid says. A 2-percentage-point increase in the Hispanic share of the electorate won't make a difference if Latino voters still break in the 40s for McCain. If there is a collapse in McCain's trend line rather than a continuation of the gradual decline--say, plummeting to a 30 percent share of the Latino vote--then Madrid estimates the Hispanic percentage of the electorate would still need to be something like 25 percent. The highest growth rates, he says, are really in Pima County instead of Maricopa. ""It's a different demographic,"" he explains. ""It's a much more rural area. It's much more recently migrated. It's much more recently naturalized. It's much more migratory, much more Spanish dominant. All of those are indictors of voting for Democrats. They are also equally strong or stronger indicators of not voting at all."" It's not like the figure atop the Democratic ticket this cycle is a particularly popular candidate, either. Just as the Democrats will try to link McCain to Trump, so too will Republicans try to link Kirkpatrick to Clinton--on both policy and on style. Republican politicos in Arizona are unimpressed with Kirkpatrick and tag her with some of the same descriptions they might Clinton: scripted, guarded, overly protected by her handlers, afraid of mixing it up with the people or speaking off the cuff. ""John McCain is a very public figure,"" says Lorna Romero, McCain's spokeswoman. ""He enjoys going out to public events. He enjoys interacting with voters. He enjoys talking to the media. That's a real contrast with him and his challenger. She is a much more private candidate. ... She is much more comfortable in a controlled environment, and that's just the reality."" The McCain campaign and other Kirkpatrick detractors point frequently to a clip of Kirkpatrick walking out of a town hall meeting during the summer of 2009, when quite a few members of Congress found themselves face-to-face with livid voters across the nation. (The Kirkpatrick campaign disputes the account, noting that it wasn't a ""town hall"" per se but a meet-and-greet with constituents that Tea Party protesters disrupted.)* Like a lot of those members, Kirkpatrick lost re-election that fall. Per the McCain campaign, that experience was the reason her public image has become Fortress Kirkpatrick. The Kirkpatrick campaign, in my experience, does have its barriers. I was able to secure 16 minutes with the candidate, by phone, with the communications director listening on. (It was admittedly a busy day.) Yet that was 16 minutes more than I got with the ""very public figure"" who ""enjoys talking to the media."" In McCain's 2000 heyday, reporters would famously spend hours shooting the breeze with the senator on his campaign bus. This was largely a strategic decision, as McCain needed to try something dramatic to increase his exposure if he was ever going to have a fighting chance against Bush. But he also enjoyed being the Anti-Candidate who refused to be buttoned up. Now he's another endangered senator, fending off grassroots organizing from the right and the left, dutifully following his staff's instructions about staying on message. * * * ""Let's go call them terrorists,"" a young man named Rob, wearing a hat that read ""Stop Islam,"" said outside the Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Phoenix. Donald Trump was a couple hours away from holding a rally. Rob was expecting large protests that day. There had been some nasty ones the last time Trump held a megarally in the valley, and only weeks earlier, protesters had turned violent on Trump supporters at a rally in San Jose, California. Protesters in Arizona have been a well-organized federation, I was told, ever since the fight over SB 1070 in 2010. Several volunteer security groups--one of them a biker group--positioned themselves outside the arena to keep a check on the situation and safely escort earnest Trumpkins to their cars. I started following Rob and a few of his friends toward the site of the protesters whom he claimed he was going to call terrorists. We walked about five minutes, and he realized that there was probably another 10-minute walk to where had he heard some protesters were, and then I turned back. It was 114 degrees in the middle of the day. The protests never really materialized, probably because of the weather. The arena wasn't full, either, probably because people didn't want to leave their homes in the heat. And also because, well, what new was there to see? McCain didn't show up at the Trump rally. Aside from him and Sen. Jeff Flake, who's not up for re-election and who, unlike McCain, hasn't endorsed Trump, just about every other Republican worth his or her golfer's tan was at the stadium. (""Yes,"" Flake reportedly said to Trump during the candidate's testy meeting with Senate Republicans, ""I'm the other senator from Arizona--the one who didn't get captured--and I want to talk to you about statements like that."") Sheriff Joe Arpaio, himself up for re-election this year, was there. One enthusiast in attendance asked him to smile. ""Smile?"" he said, incredulous. ""I never smile."" He told me he had no preference in the McCain-Ward fight but hoped the best candidate would prevail: ""What do you think I'm with Trump for?"" Former Gov. Jan Brewer, state party chairman Robert Graham--who rejected any implication that his state might be turning blue--state treasurer Jeff DeWit, and state House Speaker David Gowan all took turns speaking before Trump. Then Trump came out and did his Trump thing for 45 minutes, and there were the usual chants of ""Build the wall!"" and call-and-response bits about how it will be Mexico that pays for it. And then everyone went back outside into the heat and the parking-lot traffic. John McCain will turn 80 the day before his primary. What compels him to look at what's going on in his state--in his country--and decide, ""I want another six years""? His campaign would give me only the usual talk about how he enjoys being in the mix, fighting for Arizona, keeping America safe. The more prosaic explanation for why McCain wants another six years is that he would retain a lot of power in the Senate as a committee chair. Other explanations tend to put McCain on the couch. There is the theory, which Noble offered, that McCain doesn't want to retire because both his father and grandfather either died or didn't know what to do with themselves after their retirements from the Navy. No one I spoke with at the Trump rally seemed eager to reach for the Freudian explanation. These people simply don't like McCain. They think he's a creature of Washington who's been around too long and answers only to elite interests and national media concerns and just needs to go. But even in their denunciations there was a tinge of respect, even acceptance. They paid tribute to his military service; they acknowledged his heroism. Jason Rose, the consultant who worked for J.D. Hayworth, had mentioned to me the amazing thing with McCain: No matter how sick of McCain his detractors can get, they always have the ability to be stunned anew when they hear his biography for the hundredth or thousandth time. Let's put McCain on the couch ourselves: If the stars had aligned better for him and handed him, at age 80, an easy path to re-election, perhaps he might have been less inclined to do it. McCain likes to fight, and he feeds off of adventure and uncertainty. He isn't so much a maverick as a man constantly at war with the last version of himself. If his scenario now is partially of his own making--he inflamed the dyspeptic right just enough to draw himself a viable Republican challenger and cozied up to the dyspeptic right just enough draw himself a viable Democratic challenger--one wonders if this two-front war wasn't on some level what he wanted. McCain, restless, set himself up for the re-election of his life, and he got it. He'll never allow himself to retire. And if someone wants to retire him, it's going to be a fight. *Update, July 11, 2016: This paragraph has been updated to include comments from the Kirkpatrick campaign received after the publication of the article.

5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/america_isn_t_coming_apart.html	"A week that began with Americans celebrating their best qualities has ended with the country staring into the eyes of its worst self. The tragedies arrived in quick succession, and it's worth dwelling for a moment on the details of each one. Alton Sterling, a 37-year-old father of five, was killed Tuesday in a confrontation with police outside of a convenience store in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. According to an anonymous 911 caller, Sterling was waving a gun (the convenience store owner disputes this). Upon arrival, officers confronted Sterling, used a stun gun, and tackled him to the ground. As they worked to restrain him, they found a gun in his pocket. Moments later, they opened fire. Sterling, who had appeared subdued, was dead. In the aftermath, each player performed his role in the standard dramaturgy of these events. The police department placed its officers on administrative leave; the family expressed its heartache and called for justice; political leaders gave condolences and assured a fair investigation; the federal government announced its involvement; Hillary Clinton made a statement. But just as we were grasping Sterling's life and death--just as activists were mobilizing and journalists were analyzing--we were confronted with another incident. Another police killing. In this second video, Philando Castile is bleeding, slumped toward the woman recording the scene, Diamond Reynolds. Her 4-year-old daughter is in the backseat. A police officer is outside the car, aiming his gun at the man he has shot. As Reynolds says in her shockingly calm narration, Castile was her boyfriend. He had told the officer that he was carrying a gun and that he was reaching for his driver's license and registration. It's at this point the officer fired several times. ""Please, officer, don't tell me that you just did this to him,"" Reynolds says. ""You shot four bullets into him, sir. He was just getting his license and registration, sir."" More shocking than the last, this video prompted greater anger and greater outrage. Upon arriving in Warsaw, Poland, for a NATO summit, President Obama gave a statement decrying the killings and emphasizing the extent to which American law enforcement has a problem with racial bias. In cities across the country, protesters demanded justice, with thousands gathering in Washington, New York City, and Dallas. It was in Dallas that a peaceful, almost celebratory demonstration--involving religious groups, police officers, and ordinary people--turned into a nightmare, as a sniper (or maybe snipers) took aim at police, killing five officers in a shootout and standoff that lasted into the night. Police eventually killed the suspect--25-year-old Micah X. Johnson--using an explosive delivered by robot. Three others are in custody; their connections to the shooting aren't known. Thus far, authorities have not found any evidence to tie Johnson, an Army veteran, to the Black Lives Matter movement or any political groups. According to Dallas Police Chief David Brown, Johnson ""wanted to kill white people, especially white officers."" The killings of Sterling and Castile are a stark reminder of deep racist inequality and of the degree to which police behave this way--relentlessly scrutinizing black Americans above all others--because that's what the public wants. And the Dallas shootings provide another example of the terrible gun violence that seems to define modern American life. It was the whole American horror show, compressed into a few days. There's no context in which this string of violence wouldn't have had a heavy impact on our politics. But in this particular year, it feels ominous. Just last month, we mourned the dozens killed in the hateful rampage through a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. We've seen an upswing in prejudiced and exclusionary rhetoric, and we have a presidential candidate in Donald Trump who condones and encourages it, all for the sake of his accidental campaign for president. Accordingly, the barriers we've built to keep racism and violence out of politics are faltering, and the international picture--where once-entrenched arrangements crash against the rocks of anger and bigotry--only adds to our anxiety. Groups and individuals see opportunity in this, and they begin to stoke flames of racial hatred for their own gain. It feels, in a visceral way, as if we're coming apart. But we're not. This isn't 1968, when wars, assassinations, and riots brought our society to its knees in a way that's still hard to fathom. This isn't 1992, when another case of police brutality sparked one of the worst conflagrations ever to strike an American city. For as little political movement as we've seen on questions of police violence and racial bias, there are signs that the broad public--the white public--is waking up to the problem. Conservative writers like Matt Lewis in the Daily Caller or Leon Wolf in RedState are conceding the pervasiveness of police brutality. Prominent Republicans such as Paul Ryan did the same, praising President Obama's remarks and hailing peaceful protests. Even Newt Gingrich--who once called Obama a ""food stamp president""--agreed. ""It's more dangerous to be black in America,"" he said. ""You're substantially more likely to be in a situation where police don't respect you."" It's too much to say that there's unity in American life. Nationally, police officers are killing people as often as they were before Ferguson, Missouri, put the issue on the map. It's not enough to acknowledge problems of police violence; Americans--and white Americans in particular--have to agree to end it, which means jettisoning views that equate crime with blackness and rethinking the role of police writ large. We are still at a deep impasse on the question of guns and what to do about the violence at the heart of our society. And there is the Trump phenomenon to be reckoned with. It's still true that his campaign is a vector for racism and anti-Semitism, still true that he has proposed plans that would target racial and religious minorities, still true that he has awoken and validated an ugly nativism across the country. But the events of the past week--and perhaps the shared sense that we're on a brink of some sort--have inspired a basic decorum. Black Lives Matter has fiercely condemned the violence in Dallas, and beyond the right-wing fever swamps, there's no apparent effort to cast blame on the movement against police brutality. At the risk of indulging the soft bigotry of low expectations, this week has revealed the strength of American society at the same time it has exposed its most fragile parts. That doesn't mean we can't break apart. But it does mean that enough of us, for now, agree that there is still something here worth holding together.

6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/the_vast_left_wing_conspiracy_to_make_trump_look_like_a_bigot.html	"On Saturday, Donald Trump tweeted an image that had previously circulated among anti-Semites on social media. It was a six-pointed star, overlaid on a pile of money, with a picture of Hillary Clinton and the words ""Most Corrupt Candidate Ever!"" Predictably, the left erupted. It's the same old story: The liberal media latch onto everything Trump says, finding new ways to paint him as a bigot. ""Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David,"" Trump tweeted Monday. His pal and former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, chimed in: ""That's the mainstream media trying to attack Donald Trump."" Trump's former adviser, Michael Caputo, blasted ""people in the media"" who are trying ""to try to shame Donald Trump. ... This pattern that you're seeing is being created by those people who need to bake this bigotry into the Donald Trump candidate model."" Trump is right. For years, the media have conspired to make him look prejudiced. It started in 2011, when reporters played up his suggestions that Barack Obama had been born in Kenya, was lying about his birth certificate, and might be a Muslim. In 2014 and 2015, bloggers pounced on Trump's tweets saying that ""President Obama has absolutely no control (or respect) over the African American community"" and that ""Our great African American President hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore."" When Trump announced his candidacy last summer, journalists tried to embarrass him by posting video of him saying, during the speech, that immigrants from Mexico were rapists. Then things really got nasty. The press put out quotes and videos showing Trump taking shots at his opponents' backgrounds and religious beliefs: Jeb Bush's Mexican American wife, Ben Carson's Seventh-day Adventism, Sen. Ted Cruz's Cuban ancestry, and the Hispanic heritage of Gonzalo Curiel, the judge in the Trump University fraud case. When Trump said he had seen thousands of Arabs celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11, journalists claimed they couldn't find evidence to back him up. When he called for a ""complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,"" they accused him of discriminating based on religion. In the past six weeks, it has gotten worse. Here's a chronology of the media's cynical attacks: May 27: Trump tells a crowd in San Diego that Curiel has been ruling unfairly against him in the fraud case, apparently because the judge ""happens to be, we believe, Mexican."" The Washington Post and other Hillary-loving outlets accuse Trump of prejudice. May 30: Trump's spokeswoman, Katrina Pierson, tells CNN that Curiel is ""connected"" to protesters who brandish ""Mexican flags"" and are trying ""to stop an American president from running for office."" Liberal CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota argues with Pierson on air. June 3: Trump tells the Wall Street Journal that Curiel has ""an inherent conflict of interest"" and is unfit to preside over Trump's case because the judge is ""of Mexican heritage."" The Journal, a well-known shill for amnesty, portrays the remarks as racist. June 5: Trump tells CNN's Jake Tapper that Curiel is mistreating him because ""he's of Mexican heritage."" Tapper, in an attempt to embarrass Trump, asks him: ""If you are saying he can't do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism?"" John Dickerson piles on, asking Trump on CBS whether a Muslim jurist might be similarly disqualified because of Trump's proposed ban on Muslims. ""It's possible, yes,"" says Trump. June 12: Trump says people from the Middle East are too dangerous to allow into the United States. Even if they're vetted, he points out, we have ""no way"" to ""prevent the second generation from radicalizing."" Liberal reporters misrepresent Trump's position as ethnic discrimination. June 13: Trump says refugees are ""trying to take over our children"" by telling them ""how wonderful Islam is."" Liberals accuse Trump of going beyond terrorism and attacking Islam. June 14: Trump says ""there's no real assimilation"" of ""second- and third-generation"" families from the Middle East. Reporters, imposing their bias, question whether that's true. June 27: NBC News says Trump, in a phone interview, called Sen. Elizabeth Warren ""Pocahontas."" This follows reports that he used the same term to describe Warren on May 27, June 10, June 15, and on other occasions earlier in the campaign. June 29: Howie Carr, a radio show host and Boston Herald columnist, warms up the crowd at a Trump rally by using a Native American war whoop to mock Warren. Reporters imply that Trump is to blame. June 30: In his Herald column, Carr writes that Trump told him not to apologize for the whoop. Carr says Trump, referring to anti-black comments made 28 years ago by sportscaster Jimmy ""the Greek"" Snyder, told Carr: ""Don't apologize. You never hear me apologize, do you? That's what killed Jimmy the Greek way back. Remember? He was doing OK 'til he said he was sorry."" Now comes the Star of David ruckus, another case of agenda-driven media hype. As Trump's representatives have explained, posting an image of a six-pointed star on a pile of money with a message about corruption is a perfectly innocent gesture. It's just as innocent as Trump's previous retweets of a message from ""WhiteGenocideTM"" and of fabricated black-on-white crime data from a neo-Nazi Twitter account. ""These memes float around the internet,"" says Trump's adviser, Ed Brookover. ""There's nothing going on here. ... I can't believe that we keep coming back to this."" I can't believe it, either. Week after week, reporters who cover Trump's latest remarks and tweets about blacks, Latinos, Arabs, Muslims, Jews, and Native Americans come back to the same story. They keep trying to make Trump look like a bigot. But we won't be fooled. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	The Vast Left-Wing Media Conspiracy to Make Donald Trump Look Like a Bigot
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/our_political_culture_doesn_t_know_what_to_do_with_trump_s_explicit_prejudice.html	"If Donald Trump has done anything consistently in the year he's run for president, it's play nice with white supremacists. That's not to call Trump a bigot; it's impossible to know what's in his heart. But what Trump feels is less important than what he does. As a real estate developer and casino owner, he was sued for breaking anti-discrimination laws. During Barack Obama's first term, he accused the president of foreign birth, blasting him as illegitimate and unfit to lead. And as a presidential candidate, he's called for racist policies--surveillance and heightened scrutiny of Muslim Americans, a ban on Muslim immigration to the United States--and adopted racist rhetoric. That rhetoric goes beyond the early (and false) claim that Mexico was sending ""rapists"" to the United States under the guise of immigration, beyond his attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel for his Hispanic heritage. Trump, who relies on social media to drive his message, has used his enormous Twitter platform to amplify racist and white supremacist messages. He's retweeted anti-black memes, white nationalist writers, and users with handles like whitegenocideTM. And over the holiday weekend, Trump tweeted an anti-Semitic image of Hillary Clinton, complete with a Star of David placed on a background of cash. ""Most Corrupt Candidate Ever!"" read the star, which evoked old stereotypes of Jewish greed and avarice. The image wasn't a Trump original--it came directly from a neo-Nazi Twitter account. The Trump campaign tried to claim it was a sheriff's star, in an absurd attempt to dismiss the outrage as ""political correctness."" Zoom out and the picture is even more disturbing. In one comprehensive analysis of Trump campaign accounts--from Trump's own to that of staffers and surrogates--Fortune magazine found that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee has retweeted at least 75 users who follow ""influencers"" for the ""#WhiteGenocide"" hashtag, the rallying cry of racists who believe there's an effort to eliminate the ""white race."" In turn, a majority of those accounts are followed by more than a hundred such influential users. Katrina Pierson, Trump's national campaign spokeswoman--who is black herself--follows the most influential ""#WhiteGenocide"" account on Twitter. And that's just one example. How this happened is its own question. Are these accidental follows and retweets, mistakes born of ignorance? Do they reflect a symbiotic relationship between the online white nationalists who flocked to Trump last summer and the campaign itself, which rewards and reinforces the praise with interaction? Does it represent an alliance between figures in the Trump campaign and racist reactionaries online? Or, as Josh Marshall argues for Talking Points Memo, is it just that ""Trump keeps 'accidentally' retweeting and embracing authoritarian racism because he's an authoritarian racist?"" Let's table that discussion for later. For now, it suffices to say that it's happening--that the Trump campaign is a superhighway for an organized horde of hate that defines much of the pro-Trump grass-roots presence online. Rooted in online communities like Reddit and 4Chan, these supporters--who often identify as ""alt-right,"" a current of conservative politics on the internet where racism thrives and anti-Semitism flourishes--are virtual shock troops against journalists who criticize Trump or scrutinize his campaign and its personalities. Jewish journalists, in particular, face the worst abuse. Trump isn't responsible for his followers. He doesn't direct them. But he doesn't criticize or rebuke them either. He hems and haws when asked if he renounces an endorsement from a white supremacist; he demurs when confronted with anti-Semitic attacks in his name; he indulges and amplifies bigotry from supporters at his rallies and events; he incorporates their ideas about cultural takeover into his speeches. Anti-Semites and white nationalists have built new networks and communities, and Trump is expanding their reach in the most direct ways possible. The Star of David tweet isn't the first broadcast to mainstream politics, and it won't be the last. If political media exists to do anything, it's to reveal this flow from the fringe. To educate audiences on what these ideas mean, to give context for symbols like the one we saw on Saturday. Thus far, the media seems ill-equipped for the job. For every display of ""pro-truth"" bias, there are a dozen examples of mindless coverage, as reporters present racist rhetoric as simple ""controversy"" or frame anti-Semitic propaganda as a ""he said/she said"" dispute. This is how ideas and symbols that were once considered beyond the pale become less so. They leave the realm of taboo and enter the world of partisan combat, where ethics and meaning are a function of tribal identity. People who wouldn't have backed this rhetoric now defend it. And even those who don't, like House Speaker Paul Ryan, decline to change their political commitments. In short order, the boundaries of political speech expand to include outright bigotry. Right now, Trump is showing his dedicated following of white supremacists that you can deny the humanity of other people and still thrive in mainstream politics. If this all feels dangerous--like the beginning of a new, more frightening kind of politics--that's because it is. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Our Political Culture Doesn't Know What to Do With Trump's Explicit Prejudice
8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/elizabeth_warren_would_be_more_than_a_vp_pick.html	"For months the argument that Hillary Clinton should select Sen. Elizabeth Warren as her running mate struck me as the quadrennially annoying exercise in veepstakes overthinking and thus inadvisable for all the reasons Jamelle Bouie lists here. It would sequester Warren and her valuable insurrectionary skills into the office of a deputy. It would at least temporarily cost Democrats a Senate seat. Most importantly of all, as Jamelle writes, it would risk violating the first rule of vice-presidential selection: Do no harm. I'd iterate the rule even more abstractly: Don't get cute with it. Install a comprehensively capable warm body with bureaucratic know-how in there and run the race from the top of the ticket, where it should and will be decided. But more and more I'm coming around to the idea that Warren solves a problem for Clinton that goes beyond mere signaling. The conundrum of Clinton on the hustings is that people hate her because she sounds like a panderer; she sounds like a panderer in part because that's all an out-of-office candidate can ever be. Warren, given her policy portfolio, given that she already annoys all the people Clinton has only promised, glancingly and perhaps with a wink or two, to annoy, changes that dynamic right away. Picking her would effectively serve as Clinton's first big governing decision. For example: Wall Street. For all of the talk Clinton made this primary season about imposing new regulations on the shadow banking sector, taxing both wealthy individuals and certain financial transactions, opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and supporting various other populist policy planks, few people really ... what's the term ... believe her. Left-of-center activists believe they're being pandered to while financial elites believe that Clinton is pandering to left-of-center activists. For evidence of how lefties believe Clinton is just pandering to them: Sen. Bernie Sanders' $200 million dollars in donations and 12 million primary votes this year. Sanders and progressives worried, with good reason, that Clinton would shed her commitment to more progressive policies once she successfully dispatched of Sanders. Though the Democratic platform drafting committee has voted to include several progressive planks, Clinton's supporters on the committee curiously voted down an amendment making explicit the party's opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Part of that was surely about avoiding an awkward stance against a sitting Democratic president's signature trade agreement. But opposition to TPP is a position Clinton herself took during the primary. That looked like an explicitly political posture she would abandon later on, and the platform committee's rejection of the amendment only fuels that speculation. Wall Street never really believed any of it in the first place. It sees Clinton--and Clinton sees it--as a partner at the table. The financial sector loves the Clintons. It loved President Bill Clinton and Sen. Hillary Clinton, and it believes the Hillary Clinton it loved before will be the one who governs after she's gotten past all the election ballyhoo. In a piece from April 2015 titled ""Clinton's Wall Street Backers: We Get It,"" Politico aptly summed up Wall Street's view of Clinton's populist-tinged inveighing against hedge fund managers and executive pay. ""[T]he hedge fund managers who've long been part of her political and fundraising networks aren't sweating the putdown and aren't worrying about their take-home pay just yet,"" Politico wrote."

9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/why_brexit_isn_t_good_news_for_trump.html	"Donald Trump, his surrogates, and other Republican politicians think the Brexit vote is good news. They argue that the vote reflects a popular backlash against immigration and that it suggests Americans are ready to support Trump's agenda. Media coverage of the referendum, suffused with liberal panic, echoes this view. But polls don't support it. The vote for Brexit didn't show that a majority of voters in the United Kingdom opposes immigration. And while most Republicans support Trump's immigration policies, most Americans don't. Let's start in the U.K. Fifty-two percent of participants in the referendum voted to leave the European Union. Many of them were motivated directly by immigration concerns, but some weren't. Here's a sample of polls taken shortly before the referendum. ORB, June 8-9. Respondents were asked whether ""the economy is a bigger issue than immigration"" in deciding their vote. Among ""Leave"" supporters, 57 percent agreed. Thirty-one percent disagreed. ComRes, June 9-13. Eighty-one percent of leavers said they ""would accept a short term economic slowdown in order to tighten controls on immigration."" Sixteen percent said they wouldn't. Survation, June 20. Likely voters were asked, ""Which of these issues is the most important to you when deciding how to vote?"" Among leavers, 32 percent chose ""levels of immigration to the UK."" Another 26 percent chose ""sovereignty and who makes British laws."" Thirteen percent chose ""public services, including the NHS [National Health Service],"" 8 percent chose ""the British economy,"" and 12 percent were divided among other considerations. YouGov, June 20-22. Respondents were asked, ""Which one of the following will be most important to you in deciding how to vote in the referendum?"" Among leavers, 35 percent cited immigration. Another 45 percent chose ""a better balance between Britain's right to act independently, and the appropriate level of co-operation with other countries."" Eight percent chose ""jobs, investment and the economy,"" and 12 percent gave various other answers. Ipsos MORI, June 23. The survey asked which issues would ""be very important to you in helping you decide which way to vote."" Respondents were allowed to give multiple answers. Forty-five percent of leavers cited ""the number of immigrants coming into Britain,"" 19 percent cited ""the cost of EU immigration on Britain's welfare system,"" and 14 percent cited ""the number of refugees coming to Britain to claim asylum."" Thirty-three percent selected ""Britain's ability to make its own laws."" Thirteen percent cited ""the impact on Britain's economy,"" 11 percent cited the ""cost of EU membership fees,"" 8 percent cited ""the impact on British jobs,"" 7 percent cited ""the impact on me personally,"" and 5 percent cited ""Britain's ability to trade with countries in the European Union."" The pollsters didn't report the extent of overlap among respondents who cited multiple factors. Opinium, June 20-22. Respondents were asked whether racial equality in the U.K. had gone too far, hadn't gone far enough, or was about right. For each of these three response groups, the pollsters reported the percentage who favored leaving the EU. From these figures and the total number of respondents in each category, we can calculate how leavers answered the race question. Roughly 40 percent said racial equality had gone too far, 45 percent said it was about right, and 15 percent said it hadn't gone far enough. These numbers suggest that anti-immigration sentiment drove support for the referendum but wasn't enough to pass it. On the most generous interpretation, 81 percent of leavers were driven by migration concerns. That translates to 42 percent of the electorate. If you define the anti-immigration vote more narrowly, it was about 30 percent to 45 percent of leavers, which works out to 16 percent to 23 percent of the electorate. You could argue that people who expressed concern about ""sovereignty,"" ""Britain's ability to make its own laws,"" and ""Britain's right to act independently"" were really just anti-immigration voters. But that slights their legitimate grievances about the British-EU relationship--an arrangement for which there's no clear parallel in the United States. And even if you include these people, they don't boost the anti-immigration ""Leave"" vote above 40 percent. The Opinium poll goes further. It shows that most leavers didn't believe--or at least weren't willing to say--that racial equality in the United Kingdom had gone too far. People who expressed this view about race, and who voted to leave the EU, constituted 21 percent of the Brexit electorate. These numbers don't mollify some of Trump's critics. They worry that pundits have consistently underestimated Trump and that his victory in the Republican primaries, followed by the Brexit vote, shows broad support for his nativist agenda. Brexit suggests that ""victory is possible"" when ""hostility to migrants"" is coupled with anti-intellectualism, writes Jonathan Freedland in the New York Review of Books. ""There are lessons here aplenty for Americans contemplating their own appointment with nationalist, nativist populism in November."" That's true. Brexit is a warning, and we did underestimate Trump before primary season. But in the American electorate as a whole, as opposed to the GOP, there's no majority for Trump's views on immigration or ethnicity. Look at the latest PRRI/Brookings survey, released Thursday. Among Republicans, it shows widespread agreement with Trump's views. (See the table below.) Seventy-four percent think today's immigrants, to the extent that they change American society and our way of life, are more of a bad influence than a good one. Sixty-five percent think immigrants burden our country (by taking ""jobs, housing, and health care"") more than they strengthen the country with hard work and talent. Fifty-seven percent think immigrants increase crime in local communities. Seventy-two percent say discrimination against whites has become ""as big a problem as discrimination against blacks and other minorities."" The poll's GOP respondents broadly support Trump's agenda. Seventy-three percent say immigration from predominantly Muslim countries is too high or shouldn't be allowed at all. Sixty-eight percent say the same about immigration from the Middle East. Sixty-six percent want a wall on the Mexican border, 66 percent want a ban on Syrian refugees, 64 percent want a temporary halt to entry by foreign Muslims, and 60 percent favor ""a serious effort to deport all illegal immigrants."" That's why Trump sailed through the primaries: He was competing in a party that shares his outlook. But the general public doesn't. In the PRRI/Brookings survey, none of the views or policies I just mentioned garnered majority support. Most respondents didn't agree that immigrants increase crime or that immigration from the Middle East is too high. Most opposed a border wall, a serious deportation effort, a Muslim ban, or a policy against admitting Syrian refugees. Trump, in advancing from the primary to the general election, has advanced from an audience that shared his worldview to an audience that doesn't. His latest attempts to backpedal on the Muslim ban are an admission of this predicament. So, no, Brexit doesn't presage a Trump victory. Brexit didn't show that most Britons support Trumpism. Trump's success in the Republican primaries didn't show that most Americans support Trumpism, either. What it showed was a widening gap between the GOP and the rest of America. That gap used to be America's problem. Now it's the GOP's problem. And Brexit doesn't change that. Correction, June 29, 2016: This article's chart originally misstated that 50 percent of all U.S. adults in the PRRI/Brookings poll agreed that ""discrimination against Christians has become as big a problem as discrimination against other groups,"" while 49 percent disagreed.

So why do Brexit's biggest backers already seem so discombobulated? Commenters described ""Leave"" icon and possible next prime minister Boris Johnson as ""rather pale"" and ""uncharacteristically subdued"" the morning after. Nigel Farage, the leader of the U.K. Independence Party, spent Friday morning distancing himself from the ""Leave"" campaign's promise that Britain's EU funds would be redirected to the National Health Service; and Tory European Parliament member Daniel Hannan admitted that renegotiating Britain's relationship with the EU wouldn't actually decrease immigration. Sorry, ""Leave"" voters who wanted to either curb immigration or fund the NHS! (That's pretty much all of them.) Across social media were reports of ""Leave"" voters waking up with buyer's remorse. Some were counting on a ""Remain"" victory and wanted only to ""send a message"" or press the EU for reforms--a bit like playing a game of chicken with 64 million people's hands on the steering wheel. The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU can't happen until the country sends the EU an ""Article 50 notification,"" a formal announcement that it intends to withdraw. That notification starts a two-year countdown during which Britain and Europe negotiate the terms of their separation. At the end of two years, regardless of the state of those negotiations, Britain's out. So who sends the notification, and when? Neither the EU charter nor the Brexit referendum specifies. (The vote was nonbinding, although both sides assured voters their decision would be implemented.) Prime Minister David Cameron could plausibly have done it on Friday, but he didn't. Such a step, he said, should be taken by his successor (probably Johnson). Cameron says he isn't stepping down until October, so there are at least four months before the trigger is pulled. (EU officials and member governments are pressing the Brits to move quickly, but there's not much they can do about it, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel says she's comfortable with a more leisurely withdrawal.) Perhaps Johnson--or pro-""Remain"" Tory MP Theresa May, or whoever else succeeds Cameron--will make a point of delivering the notification on his or her first day in office. And if the ""Leave"" crowd is still riding high, that's what will happen. But that doesn't seem to be the way things are going--which is why, even after a referendum that has paused global markets and unseated a prime minister, there's a strong chance that there will never be a Brexit. How will ""Leave"" voters feel in October, with the pound still down and the revelations about their campaign's broken promises? Some will still want out, but how many more will have second thoughts? And Johnson knows that as soon as he triggers Article 50 and begins the actual withdrawal process, the markets will plunge again. Is that how he wants his term to begin? (It's widely believed Johnson's decision to back ""Leave"" reflected something other than a deep-seated commitment to the cause.) As legal blogger David Allen Green points out, the more time that passes before the Article 50 notification is sent, the less likely it is to happen. Leavers are already stressing that there's no rush to actually, you know, leave. As Tory MP Liam Fox told the BBC:"	Brexit May Well Never Happen

The consequences of Thursday's vote are momentous. But it is even more important for what it represents: Today, we are entering a new political era--one in which popular support for the core institutions of liberal democracy can no longer be taken for granted. The practical consequences of Britain's departure from the European Union are terrifying. Millions of European citizens living in Britain woke up to the disorienting realization that they may soon lose the right to stay in a country they had made their home. The same goes for British citizens living in France, or Spain, or Germany. If politicians fail to ensure that some amount of freedom of movement between Britain and the rest of Europe is preserved, the disruption to the lives of ordinary people will be on a scale practically unprecedented in peacetime. But even if some reasonably humane solution is worked out, the emotional toll exacted by the uncertainty they face will be serious. At the same time, Brexit will also speed up the continent's centrifugal forces: England is turning inward. Scotland may well leave the United Kingdom before the decade is over. The uneasy peace in Northern Ireland is being put to a serious, and wholly unnecessary, test. In the coming years, copycat referenda on EU membership are likely to be held in countries at the European core, such as the Netherlands. There can no longer be any doubt that the European Union is in an existential crisis. Europe's weakness harms the West as a whole. As the continent lurches from crisis to crisis and sees the gradual rise of populist strongmen on its own shores, it is getting increasingly tempted to make nice with authoritarian leaders in Turkey, Russia, and China. It's little wonder that, outside Britain, the only triumphant voices to be heard Friday morning are those of Donald Trump, Marine Le Pen, Vladimir Putin, and the propaganda outlets of ISIS. These points alone would suffice to make the outcome of Thursday's referendum the most significant vote in a generation. But its true importance is even bigger than that: The decision of the British electorate to leave the European Union constitutes the most significant rebellion of the citizens of an affluent liberal democracy against their political system since the end of World War II. It signals the beginning of an era in which we can no longer be assured that the citizens of countries from Sweden to the United States will reliably choose liberal democracy over far-right populism and xenophobia. There are plenty of reasons to be dissatisfied with the European Union as it is currently constituted. The EU leaves the most important decisions to an unelected council of the ministers of its member states, giving ordinary Europeans little control. And countries such as Greece are paying a massive--and seemingly indefinite--price for the faulty construction of the single currency zone. Though I strongly believe that the human and political consequences of the U.K.'s departure from the European Union made a ""Leave"" vote unconscionable, I have some sympathy for those who advocated Brexit on the basis of sovereignty or in the hope of building a more robust welfare state. As the polls show, however, those were not the reasons that most supporters of Brexit had in mind. In fact, voters on both sides of the divide had virtually indistinguishable views on such questions as whether ""capitalism"" was good or bad. But Brexiters had starkly more negative views on issues such as ""immigration,"" ""multiculturalism,"" and ""social liberalism."" The vote to leave the European Union was not a vote against Europe's financial elites. It was a vote against civil rights, against ethnic minorities, against immigrants, and against refugees. This also puts a rather more sinister cast on all the talk of sovereignty. Voters cared some about whether decisions will be taken in London or Brussels in the future. They cared much more about whether checks and balances would continue to stop the people's righteous anger from expressing itself. What they really want is the freedom to make discriminatory laws against the immigrants and minorities whom the chief proponents of Brexit demonized throughout the campaign. As my recent research shows, British voters are far from alone in turning against the limits on the popular will that constitute an important element of liberal democracy. Across most countries in North America and Western Europe, voters have grown deeply dissatisfied with the political class. For a rapidly growing number, this dissatisfaction with particular leaders has started to transform into an actual rejection of democratic institutions. Across North America and Western Europe, the number of citizens who say that it is important to live in a democracy is shrinking. At the same time, the number of citizens who are open to making their countries more authoritarian is rising. This trend is especially striking in the United States. Two decades ago, 1 in 16 Americans believed that Army rule would be a good way to run the country. Today, it is 1 in 6. The picture is even bleaker among the young and affluent: Support for military rule in this group has increased nearly sixfold, from 6 percent to 35 percent. Obviously, Brexit won't lead to military rule. Nor is the Pentagon about to assume power in America. Opinion polls need to be interpreted carefully and with a healthy dose of skepticism. But when they show such a stark shift in opinion, it is safe to conclude that something big is going on. That big thing, I fear, is that the citizens of liberal democracies have grown so disenchanted with the status quo that they are willing to put their faith in populist strongmen and radical political experiments. Two decades ago, far-right populists were electorally insignificant in most of North America and Western Europe. Then, people such as Jorg Haider in Austria, Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, and Marine Le Pen in France celebrated a remarkable string of political successes, establishing their movements as a firm part of their political systems and making their countries less hospitable for immigrants and other minority groups. In countries such as the United States, France, or Sweden, they are now within striking distance of outright majorities. Thursday's referendum proves that there is no magic firewall that is sure to stop them. It is worth remembering that David Cameron only called this referendum because he, along with the vast majority of Britain's political class, was convinced that Brexit would never happen. It is also worth remembering that, 24 hours ago, most polls seemed to point to a victory for the forces of stability. This should serve as a stark warning to people who are confident that Donald Trump could never be elected president. If he manages to turn the election into a referendum on the status quo, he has every chance of winning--especially since all the evidence suggests that the citizens of liberal democracies have never held the status quo in as much contempt as they do now. If we blindly trust the polls that seem to foretell his defeat, we might be in for an even ruder awakening come November. Read more on Slate about Brexit."

But don't mistake that silliness for stupidity. America always threatens to tip over into ""the fury, the violence, and the desperation of the counterpastoral ... the indigenous American berserk."" English silliness is the silliness of a Twelfth Night festival, at which order is temporarily upended, then safely restored at midnight. It acts as a safety valve for an essentially stable authority. The British establishment has sometimes behaved sadistically toward those it didn't deem worthy of membership; it has had a tendency to coddle things like pederasty and alcoholism; it was never above ransacking its monasteries and distributing their treasures to its cronies. And yet for all its corruption, it did its job. It adapted. It made common cause with one former enemy after another: the Scots, the French, the Germans. In the 1940s, Britain suffered sustained aerial bombing that killed 40,000 civilians--imagine 13 Sept. 11s within eight months--and then helped the aggressors rebuild. It gave up its empire and pioneered the welfare state. It's a modern cosmopolitan democracy with a Parliament established in the 13th century and a monarchy that goes back to 871. Britain at the end of the 20th century was often violent, and corrupt, and racist, and tacky. But it didn't seem likely to fall apart, because it had an establishment that took its preservative responsibility seriously. That is no longer the case. There are plenty of reasons the U.K. has seen fit to plunge directly off a cliff: the impoverishment of the provinces, the government's austerity policies, the race-baiting demagoguery of the newspapers, the lousy weather that depressed turnout in London, the incompetent governance of the European Union. But all of this would have caused only ordinary misery if not for two men at the heart of the establishment scrabbling disastrously after short-term opportunity. Boris Johnson is essentially amoral, a trickster. He finagled his way into the establishment as a kind of performing monkey, with his wild hair and his enthusiasm for being photographed in amusing situations. The U.K. has a tradition of journalist-politicians, loquacious men who write witty columns and tell funny stories on TV and then stand for Parliament and make it seem like a bit of fun. (Remember that London is both the media capital and the seat of government-- both New York and Washington--which makes it easier to move from one world to the other.) Most serve a term or two and then return to writing newspaper columns or biographies. Johnson is more ambitious than that. He saw in the ""Leave"" campaign an opportunity--to topple David Cameron and position himself as his logical successor, and to make some mischief--and he took it. Better to reign in hell than serve in Brussels. Whereas Cameron, an establishment man through and through, is the sort of person who gets away with too many things and comes to mistake his privilege for innate luck. ""I've never hidden the fact that I am a very lucky person,"" he said when it emerged he'd profited from an offshore trust in Panama set up by his father. ""I had wealthy parents who gave me a great upbringing."" He was lucky to become prime minister when negotiations between Labour and the Liberal Democrats broke down. He was lucky that a 2014 vote on Scottish independence didn't sunder the United Kingdom on his watch. When Nigel Farage's U.K. Independence Party threatened to siphon off anti-immigrant voters from the Tories, Cameron took a risk and offered them a referendum on Brexit. It was surely a failure of imagination: He couldn't believe his luck would let him down. So, for another term as prime minister, he gambled with his country's future, and with the future of Europe--with the whole historic struggle to transcend nationalism and ethnic grievance. As it happens, he lost. Americans are always ready to take up against the elites, to gleefully reject the best advice of the experts and go their own way, even if their own way is gruesome and stupid. Americans cherish their freedom to shoot themselves in the foot, both literally and figuratively. But this populist moment plays differently in Britain. After years of austerity and stagnation, the governing classes saw anti-elitism and racial resentment as tigers to ride. Surely they were still in control. Why not let the punters have a bit of fun? But the British people, half of them, at least (the older, whiter half), had stopped letting the establishment tell them what to do--were eager, in fact, to give the establishment a poke in the eye, just as Boris did. Some of them thought this was more silliness. The powers that be wouldn't really let things fall apart, would they? Read more Slate coverage of the Brexit vote."

But if American voters are going to do a version of what British (and Northern Irish) voters just did--put aside their good sense and self-interest, in this case by voting for Donald Trump--it will be despite Trump's continued campaign of self-sabotage and idiocy. For the second time in a month, Trump has greeted a genuine tragedy or crisis with aggrandizement and know-nothingness. He could still win, but it will be in spite of himself: His inability to be anything other than Donald Trump may just save the country from his reign. Just last week we were all furiously speculating on what the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history--by someone who had pledged allegiance to ISIS--would do for Trump's poll numbers. Republicans generally benefit after terrorist attacks, and Trump himself had staked out anti-ISIS ground early in his campaign. We soon got our answer: Trump was as incapable of using the Orlando tragedy to his political advantage as he is of staying on message during one of his many attempted ""pivots"" to respectability. After tweeting self-congratulations and seeming less presidential than even a skeptic thought imaginable, Trump gave a mean-spirited and much-reviled speech. He appeared unprepared for the moment and unseemly in his glee at what he saw as his clairvoyance. The polls didn't budge. The first hints from Scotland, where Trump is ridiculously staying for a couple days not to prove his foreign policy chops but to look in on a golf property, seem to offer more of the same. What would seem like a perfectly Trumpian move by the voters of the United Kingdom--the Brexit campaign was in large part a reaction to immigration; the next prime minister is likely to be Boris Johnson, a slightly sinister and slightly absurd Trump-lite figure; nationalism has reasserted its appeal--was instead another occasion for Trump to act childish. After landing in Scotland, he proceeded to tweet out congratulations to the place for its vote. Of course, Scotland had just voted to remain in the European Union, to little avail. When asked about Johnson, he replied, ""Who is Boris? I don't know him."" It was Trump at his most Trumpian: international relations as mindless solipsism. But even worse than the boneheaded statements was the spectacle of a politician unthinkingly cheering as markets were tanking and amid general panic. Trump is simply not able to separate his own interest from the country's or for that matter the world's. While this may be true of many politicians, they at least hide it better. It's early yet in the depressing British-EU crisis, and Trump could very well find a way to capitalize on it. But his early statements and behavior suggest that instead he will just be himself. It may be the only thing that protects us from eight years of nothing but him. Read more of Slate's Brexit coverage."	Trump's Absurd Response to Brexit: World-Historical Solipsism on a Global Stage
14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/facebook_live_and_periscope_really_won_that_sit_in.html	Democratic members of Congress just finished their sit-in on the House floor. As Jamelle Bouie noted early this morning, the sit-in was unprecedented--and perhaps transformative--for many reasons: the ideological uniformity with which Democrats have rallied around gun control; their willingness to disrupt normal House business; and the form of the protest itself, which feels like a tactic from a bygone era. But there's another way in which the sit-in marks a political watershed: It unfolded via live-stream on social media. Typically, footage from the floor of the House of Representatives is aired on C-SPAN. But when Speaker Paul Ryan declared the House in recess in response to the sit-in, C-SPAN's feed cut out. That's when Facebook Live, a live video-streaming service launched in August and revamped in April by the social media giant, and Twitter's year-old live-streaming app Periscope, became essential. After C-SPAN stopped broadcasting, Democrats quickly went on the offensive, decrying the move as majority-party obstructionism. Here's Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who joined the sit-in Wednesday, on Twitter: But as the Washington Post reported late Wednesday, the drying up of C-SPAN's feed was less a matter of partisan politics than of procedure. House Republicans, who were presiding over the floor when Lewis began his sit-in at 11:25 a.m., had no choice but to call a recess after the demonstration interrupted scheduled House business. Per rules laid down in January 2015, when members of the 114th Congress first took their seats, that meant C-SPAN's coverage went with it. A clearly frustrated C-SPAN staffer clarified this point in a pinned tweet that sat atop the network's Twitter feed as the sit-in rolled on: Democrats quickly found a way around that. In a first-of-its-kind maneuver, C-SPAN began airing the Periscope live-stream feed of California Rep. Scott Peters and the Facebook Live feed from Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke. Here's some of that footage: Peters: O'Rourke: After a brief interlude--during which Ryan reopened the session in an ultimately futile bid to restore order--brought C-SPAN's cameras back to life, legislators continued to use social media to broadcast the proceedings to an audience wider than the infamously soporific network's. A Facebook spokesman told me that, over the course of the sit-in, 19 House members used Facebook Live and garnered a combined viewership of 3 million Facebook users.  Facebook and Twitter must be thrilled. (Several of the more prolific live-streaming legislators even got personalized shoutouts from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Thursday afternoon.) The demonstration provided ideal conditions for illustrating the power of live-streaming to politicians--the capacity to get around traditional media and broadcast a message directly to the people. The sit-in may have ended. Democrats' current fever over gun control may break. But don't expect the live-streams to go dark anytime soon.

In a May episode of the Slate Trumpcast, Jacob Weisberg interviewed John McLaughlin, a former acting director and deputy director of the CIA, about these briefings. To listen to that podcast, click the player below: A lightly edited transcript of that conversation follows. Jacob Weisberg: So you have given a security briefing to presidential candidates in the past. What happens in those briefings? John McLaughlin: Well, each one is a separate and unique situation, and the way it works is determined primarily through a discussion between the White House and the candidate or the candidate's advisers. So some candidates want to be briefed once, and that's it, for a short period of time. Others like periodic updates, and they work that out with the White House. And in terms of what happens, a briefer shows up and the briefer has a series of issues that he or she is going to take the candidate through, typically the ones that are in the headlines. Today, you can imagine it might be Syria, Iran, North Korea, Russia, China--things that a candidate who aspires to be president probably ought to know about in terms of what's available privately as well as publicly And then it really depends on the candidate. Sometimes the candidate will sit and listen. Sometimes a candidate will interrupt frequently and really take the conversation where he or she wants to go. That more frequently is the case, in my experience. And sometimes they will have an adviser with them. That has to be worked out with the White House as well. And that's the basic drill. Weisberg: I think I read you briefed George W. Bush before he was president and also John Kerry before he was not president. Is that right? McLaughlin: Correct, correct. [Laughs.] Those two, and also John Edwards. Occasionally a vice presidential candidate or the team will request that both presidential and vice presidential candidates be briefed. That's the only occasion that I was personally involved in that I remember that being the case, when it was Kerry and Edwards. Weisberg: So how classified is the information you get into in those briefings? Is it comparable to the level of briefing a president gets when in office, or is it something short of that? McLaughlin: Well, it's very close. In my experience, this kind of varies from administration to administration in terms of how much freedom the briefer has to go deep. The briefer is going to have to be somewhat improvisational. You have some guidelines, but inevitably the candidate takes you to the things that are of interest to that person. Typically, the rule I always had in my mind was the candidate can be briefed on just about everything except things that are not widely shared within the national security team itself in the government. So take, as an example, the operation that was mounted in 2011 to take down Bin Laden. If there had been a candidate briefing, say, two or three months before that operation, it almost certainly would not have been discussed because there were many people in senior levels of government who didn't know about it. It was that tightly held. But beyond those things, I had freedom from the administration to go where I thought the candidate needed to go to understand an issue. Weisberg: Now does the presidential candidate need or get a security clearance before receiving classified information? McLaughlin: Not to my knowledge. Conceivably something went on behind the scenes that I wasn't aware of, but to my knowledge the assumption is that if they've gotten that far there's no point in clearing them because they're cleared by election, essentially, as are most congressmen and senators. Weisberg: So you may see what I'm driving at, John, but what if you were in a position as a briefer briefing someone who wouldn't pass a security clearance, who you might feel is just fundamentally not trustworthy? McLaughlin: Again, I can't stress the degree to which, in the end, the briefer has to use personal judgment because of the fluid, dynamic nature of these discussions. Who am I to judge, sitting there, that this person would or would not pass a clearance? You may have concerns about someone based on their public persona. You know, people have asked me, for example, what about Trump? He seems to blurt things out. He seems himself very improvisational. If you stop and think about it, any presidential candidate is in the competition of their lives. They will never be in a more competitive, higher-stakes competition. So the temptation to somehow take what you're giving them and bend it to political purposes has to be there in every case. At some level, you have to count on them as patriotic Americans to do the right thing. Weisberg: But let me give you a hypothetical. I mean, it sounds like if there was information about a threat of an impending terrorist attack, that would be the kind of thing, absent information about sources and so on, that could be in the briefing. Boy, it's easy for me to imagine Trump using that in a political context and hard for me to imagine him keeping it confidential. McLaughlin: Well, try and imagine it, I guess would be my advice to you. I think the more interesting thing with Mr. Trump would be just how he absorbs discordant information because in an intelligence briefing you're almost certain to hear things that are at odds with your preconceptions, and you've got to deal with that. Politics exists in a very different world than intelligence. In politics, people take whatever facts they possess, or what they judge to be facts, and they stack them up and rearrange them and come up with a conclusion that favors their point of view and then the other side takes the very same set of facts and stacks them up and rearranges them to come out with their point of view. I think we call that spin, don't we? Weisberg: [Laughs.] Yes. McLaughlin: There is no spin in intelligence. There can't be. By definition, anyone who is doing intelligence right is going to just lay it out there. Sometimes you're going to hear something that doesn't accord with what you thought was the case or perhaps even what you were saying publicly is the case. Weisberg: So you are watching the candidate, or the president elect, to see how they absorb information, how they respond to information that maybe conflicts with what they thought, and figuring out for the future, potentially, how to get through to them, how to communicate with them. McLaughlin: Yes, and they're telling you. It's a conversation. In my experience it's always been a conversation. Let's take a hypothetical. I think Mr. Trump has called for backing away from Korea and Japan. We could back away from them as allies or be less involved as allies if they didn't pay more for their defense. Well, an intelligence briefer, at that point, might just work into the briefing the fact that Japan has been paying $2 billion for stationing our troops on their territory under a four-year agreement that comes up, I think, for renewal in 2016. And so the question would be, 'Is that enough?' I don't know if Mr. Trump knows that, that they've been paying $2 billion. I can see circumstances, and this is true of any candidate, but it might be a little truer in Mr. Trump's case, where what you're saying rubs up against, in an unpleasant way, stuff that he believes or has said. Weisberg: Mr. Trump has also suggested policies that violate America law, or international law, such as torture. Would you be in a position, as a briefer, whether he asked about it or not, to say, ""Mr. Trump, we heard you say that, but you can't do that as president."" McLaughlin: Again, you wouldn't go in with an agenda of things that you're going to tell him, along the lines of, ""Dear Mr. Candidate, here are all the things you've said that are wrong."" You wouldn't start that way. You would just start with your briefing. Now if that issue arose, probably in the context of a question from him, about how many captures is the government doing and how you are treating the captives, you would explain that in terms of treating detainees these days the U.S. government is bound by the Army Field Manual and by executive order and I believe by laws now that determined the techniques you could use. And then it would be up to him to say, ""Well, what about this?"" And you would just in a very matter of fact way say, ""Well, that is not permitted anymore under current law."" Weisberg: ""And when I get in we are going to change all that."" McLaughlin: You know, I've had candidates say things like that to me: ""When I become president""--I won't name candidates, but I've had candidates say to me, ""Well, when I become president we're going to change that."" You don't debate them at that point. That's not your job. Weisberg: You suggested that the president has a fair amount of discretion about what might be included in such a briefing, I realize it would be unprecedented, but could the president or the national security adviser say, ""In this case, we're not going to give a classified briefing to the nominee of a major party."" McLaughlin: That would be unprecedented and technically, technically, that could happen because ultimately the president in the executive branch owns this information and is responsible for its classification and its declassification. So technically that could happen. It's hard for me to imagine that happening, frankly. Weisberg: And in terms of what is probable, who do you think would be the likely person or agency representative to do this briefing, now that you're retired? McLaughlin: Well, in my day, it used to almost always be led by a CIA officer. I had taken, on a number of occasions, someone from other agencies. I took once to Kerry briefings the deputy director of the FBI because I felt that discussion of potential for domestic terror attacks was important. These days I think the decision on who does the briefing is not in the CIA director's hands. It's in the hands of the director of national intelligence, who would be Jim Clapper. Basically, you want someone who is going to be knowledgeable and able to handle themselves in that situation. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

With abysmal numbers among blacks, Hispanics, and other minority groups, white voters are the only path Trump has to the White House. He'll have to win all of them--white men, white women, white youth, the white working class--and he'll have to win them by substantial margins. In theory, this should be fertile ground for the real estate mogul. Trump has unprecedented pull with working-class whites, especially men. If he can match past Republican performance with college-educated whites and hold his increased share among their counterparts with high school diplomas, he'll have a smooth path to victory. In reality, this would be almost impossible--an electoral Kobayashi Maru. The reason is that Trump's problems go beyond nonwhites. The ostensible candidate for white America has a white-voter problem too. At this point in the 2012 election, according to the Pew Research Center, Mitt Romney held a 13 point lead among all white voters. He led Barack Obama by 21 points among white men, and by 6 points among white women. Among whites age 18 to 49, he led by 7 points; among whites older than 50, he led by 17 points. At election's end, Romney had won 59 percent of white voters, on par with the highest modern total since Ronald Reagan's 1984 landslide against Walter Mondale. Romney's success with whites--while higher than usual--was on trend. Since 1968, Republicans had won the lion's share of white voters. Even when they lost the presidency in previous elections--in 1976, in 1992, in 1996--the GOP has always won a majority (or plurality) of whites. If the distribution of voters had been static in more recent elections, Republicans would still control the field in presidential elections, even as Democrats won the large majority of nonwhites. But whites are a declining share of the electorate, which has offset this Republican advantage. It's still valuable, but not as much. If George W. Bush's Hispanic outreach efforts had worked--or rather, if the GOP hadn't squandered those efforts--the party would be in a strong national position today. So we know that Trump has ruined the Republican Party's tenuous ties to nonwhite communities, and Hispanic Americans in particular. Less remarked on is the extent to which he's moving white voters--or at least a meaningful segment of them--into the Democratic column. For the first time in modern elections, a majority of college-educated whites are backing the Democratic candidate for president. According to Pew's June survey--a comprehensive look at the electorate--Clinton holds a 12 point advantage among whites with a college degree, 52 percent to 40 percent. If you break that into men and women, she trails among the former--losing college-educated white men by 7 points--but holds a 31 point advantage with the latter, swamping Trump, 62 percent to 31 percent. ""Realignments"" in American politics are overstated--or at least, not as sudden as they might seem--but if this result holds to November, it may herald a new stage in presidential politics, or at least the composition of the Democratic Party. There has always been a gender gap, with Democrats winning women far more than men. But this was a function of age and race as much as anything else; disaggregate the numbers, and white women were a solid vote for the GOP. Trump, with his erratic behavior and misogynist rhetoric, has changed that. Now, a relative disadvantage with women has become an absolute one. According to Pew, Republicans are losing married women by 12 points (another unprecedented change), unmarried women by 37 points, and white women--a former redoubt--by 10 points. Trump wins white women without college degrees, but it's a slight 3 point margin. Depending on the shape of the election from now to November, he could lose them too. It's this shift among white women that's driving the inversion of white support within the Democratic Party. Twenty years ago--when a different Clinton was running for re-election--the Democratic Party was struggling to regain its advantage with working-class whites, who had formed the popular base of the party's white support overall. But 2008, 2012--and now 2016--has changed that. Increasingly, Democrats are drawing their white support from college-educated Americans in the prosperous suburbs of states like Colorado, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, just as Republicans are deepening their hold on working-class whites nationwide. For the immediate future, this means that Trump is in a bad place. If winning downscale white voters means losing their higher-income counterparts, then he's simply substituting one demographic for another, in a way that leaves him further behind. But more interesting than this short-term electoral calculation are the long-term implications for American politics. A Republican Party that loses its absolute hold on white women is one where Trump-style politics--his blend of aggressive resentment and economic nationalism--continues to hold sway among the base. And a big-tent Democratic Party of college-educated whites and working-class nonwhites is one that might continue its streak of national wins and regional defeats. That is, if it can survive the inevitable class tensions that come with trying to keep a big tent from falling into itself. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Donald Trump Is Headed for a Historic Loss with a Crucial Group of White Voters
17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/how_bernie_s_small_donor_revolution_could_change_politics_on_the_left.html	"By almost any measure, Barry Goldwater is one of the most important losers in the history of American politics. His landslide loss to Lyndon Johnson contained the inklings of a new GOP coalition and energized an entire generation of conservative activists who would eventually reshape and dominate the Republican Party. One of them was Richard Viguerie. In 1965, after Goldwater's catastrophic loss to Lyndon Johnson, the young-ish Viguerie--first national secretary of Young Americans for Freedom--got into the mailing business. Starting from a list of 12,500 donors who'd given to Goldwater--culled from official congressional records and copied down in longhand--Viguerie built one of the most important political operations of the 1970s. It was simple: He would target these donors (and others like them) with mail that solicited and evangelized on behalf of various conservative causes. He collected countless thousands more names and addresses (and donations), and he would use the information to solicit and evangelize some more. Viguerie's scheme was wildly successful--raising cash on a previously unseen scale--and quickly adopted by other conservative activists and organizations. In short order, ""direct mail"" would become one of the most important funding streams for the conservative movement, providing millions for organizing, giving fuel to a dynamic and dedicated grass-roots. In a real way, Viguerie's revolution in mail paved the path for the election of Ronald Reagan and his conservative ascendancy. It was a mechanical innovation in the landscape of American politics that helped produce tremendous ideological and institutional changes that persist into the present. Most of the praise and postmortem on the Sanders campaign focuses on personality and platform. And it is true: Sanders is the most successful socialist candidate in American history who came within a stone's throw of winning a major party nomination. He widened the universe of the possible with advocacy for universalist policies that would require huge expansions of the welfare state on par with the New Deal and Great Society. He took steps toward challenging Washington's consensus on Israel and Palestine, and integrated--to an extent--left-wing critiques of American racial inequality. It's been a remarkable run, hardly diminished by reports of strategic missteps and deep resentments. But remarkable campaigns are just that--campaigns. Even if they succeed, the crowds eventually dissolve, the energy dissipates, and the winners have to get down to the hard work of governing or movement building. Sanders, for all of his virtues as a politician, hasn't shown the appetite for that kind of grind, where the crawl is measured in years (if not decades) and the path isn't always clear. And while it's comforting to say he ""represents the future""--a claim I've made before--even that requires action. ""There's a temptation to assume that everything new in politics is a harbinger of the future,"" says political scientist Dave Hopkins in an interview with Vox's Jeff Stein. ""But lots of things are dead ends: They rise, and they go away."" He's right. It's just as likely, he argues, that President Barack Obama--popular with the vast majority of Democrats and most Americans--represents the party's future. But that's not to say the Sanders campaign didn't matter. It did. Sanders was able to fight his insurgency through to the end because he had the cash. Over the course of his campaign, he raised over $220 million almost exclusively from small donations (largely under $200), surpassing Clinton's total if you exclude cash from super PACs and other groups. In endorsing Clinton on Tuesday, Sanders took a moment to single out these donors--""the millions of contributors who showed the world that we could run a successful national campaign based on small individual contributions."" This was indeed unprecedented. The main reason most intraparty insurgencies fail is resources. The ""establishment"" advantage is that its candidate will always have a steady flow of cash generated by major donors and other traditional sources. And that, in part, is how they win: by overwhelming opponents in areas--advertising, get out the vote--that require large investments in money and staff. When this primary began, conventional wisdom was that Bernie Sanders would suffer the fate of so many other insurgents precisely because he was disconnected from traditional fundraising sources. Establishment fundraising comprises wealthy individuals and powerful interests, as well as smaller contributions from ordinary people. But Team Sanders--building on the experience of Obama's 2008 and 2012 campaigns--zeroed in on the lattermost group, tying the senator's anti-Wall Street and anti-Citizens United message to a small-donor fundraising apparatus cultivated through constant engagement, online or otherwise. In public events like rallies and debates, Sanders always made the connection, linking his crusade to a call for donations. He used technology to streamline the process of making small contributions. The day after winning the New Hampshire primary, these donors filled the campaign's coffers to the tune of more than $6 million. During the month of April, Sanders raised more than $25 million, a drop from his March total of $44 million. This was the greatest triumph of the Sanders campaign: To surpass establishment fundraising with small-dollar donations is to change how presidential politics is conducted. Now, candidates have space to marginalize influential factions and interests within the party--Wall Street, for instance--without facing an insurmountable deficit in election-year funding. That, far more than Sanders' electoral performance, opens the space for more left-wing politics (although the two are related). It is hard, and often unwise, to make predictions about what will happen in politics. However, there's a strong chance that the Sanders fundraising apparatus--which surpasses Obama's in its scope and ability to rapidly raise huge sums--will end up as the senator's chief contribution to progressive politics. Like direct mail, it could stand as a mechanical change to the business of politics that could sustain left-wing activists and reformists, if maintained and utilized. In the 1970s, direct mail opened up fundraising on an unprecedented scale, funding otherwise tough elections against ""establishment"" moderates, and linking conservative activists and politicians to active and potential supporters. Conservatives forged a tool that helped build a grass-roots network of voters and volunteers--one that played a vital part in swinging American politics to the right. Money was how the ideological became practicable. With its fundraising infrastructure, the Sanders campaign has built a 21st century analogue to the old right-wing apparatus. The only question is whether left-wing activists--and Sanders himself--can see the opportunity at hand to weave their ideology into the fabric of Democratic politics.

18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/mike_pence_isn_t_crazy_to_want_to_be_trump_s_vp.html	"There are a lot of things to say about the names on Trump's purported vice presidential shortlist, but ""has any political future whatsoever"" isn't one of them. Newt Gingrich is the national mascot for grand ole crankery whose gigs include going on CNN and making dumb DVDs. Chris Christie is the term-limited governor of New Jersey who couldn't make it past New Hampshire in his own presidential run and is disliked by most everyone in his state and America at large. Jefferson ""Jeff"" Beauregard Sessions III is an old man in the Senate who hates immigrants and has a stereotypically poor history of racial comments. Retired Gen. Michael Flynn is interesting as a dark horse, but he's a pro-choice novice whom Trump appears to have soured on. Which brings us to the hot candidate for at least the next 47 minutes, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. The Washington Times reported Sunday that Trump is ""likely"" to select Pence as his running mate. The story quoted Republican lawyer and insider James Bopp as saying there's a ""95 percent"" chance Trump picks Pence now that his campaign has scheduled a mid-week Indianapolis rally with the governor. This all leads me to believe that Pence won't be the vice presidential pick. That's not meant as an insult to the Washington Times' intrepid reporting or Bopp's rigorous statistical analysis; it's just that presidential campaigns are sophisticated operations that intentionally throw out red herrings--like, say, scheduling a mid-week rally with a reported member of the short-list--solely to troll reporters and prolong the secret. Then again, Trump's presidential campaign is not a sophisticated operation, and maybe he's scheduling a rally with Pence to introduce him as his vice presidential pick. This raises the question of what in God's name Pence is thinking. Here is a figure conservatives have respected for a decade, who served as a leader in the House and now as a governor. He took a beating and his polling dropped following last year's Religious Freedom Restoration Act mess, a fiasco that certainly contributed to his decision not to run for president in 2016. If he were able to grind through that to gubernatorial re-election this year, though, the table might be cleared for a run in 2020. Why interrupt that by resigning as governor and hitching his wagon to a probably doomed Trump campaign? Conventional theories about how Republican hopefuls should prep themselves for 2020 in anticipation of a Trump walloping usually involve circumventing this year's nominee without outright rejecting him. Sen. Marco Rubio--the ideal figure to follow if you wish to glean the prevailing conventional wisdom of GOP consultants --has given several thousand answers about his allegiance to the presidential nominee. Sen. Ted Cruz has given several thousand punts. You don't want to embrace the joke nominee, but you don't want to disrespect the many voters in your party who, in Cruz's and Rubio's cases, voted for him in greater numbers than they did for you. The safe answer, then, is to pathetically muddy the waters so as to be able to give whichever answer is popular when the next campaign rolls around. What if we were to posit--take a breath--that perhaps the conventional wisdom among the GOP consultant class here, and elsewhere, is debatable? And that it might be worth the risk for Pence to challenge it? National Review's Eliana Johnson, in a piece seeking to answer why Pence would consider accepting the VP slot, reports that a future presidential run of his own is very much part of Pence's consideration. ""Several of the governor's confidants"" tell Johnson that Pence ""believes a spot on the national ticket could simultaneously lift him out of a tough re-election campaign in Indiana and make him a top prospect for the Republican nomination in 2020 or 2024."" If it's 2024 and Pence is a sitting vice president, it's obvious enough how accepting Trump's offer puts him in line to be the next Republican presidential nominee. But in the more likely case that Trump-Pence goes down in flames? What edge would that give Pence in 2020? The loyalty card. The Republican base will not like the presidency of Hillary Clinton if it comes to pass. I know, I know. They will describe her as even worse than President Obama, the previous worst person in history, whether they believe that or not. Republican voters who didn't particularly love Donald Trump but supported him anyway in an effort to stop Clinton will say to those who kept their distance from Trump: See what you left us with? Here's where Pence would have a unique advantage over Cruz, Rubio, or any other 2020 prospect who didn't give everything they had to elect Donald Trump. Any time during the 2020 campaign that they mention something terrible Clinton has done--which will be just about every other word--Pence can jump in and say: Yeah, and what did you do to prevent this? I quit my job to stop Hillary Clinton from getting elected president, while you just looked out for yourself. If Pence eventually does want to be president, accepting Trump's VP offer if it comes might be his best play. It would give him a bond to loyal Republican voters and a boost to his national stature. If he didn't take it and Trump lost, he'd enter 2020 as a once-promising House member turned socially conservative governor hustling for national name recognition. Ask Bobby Jindal how far that gets you. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Why Would Mike Pence or Anyone Else Want to Be Trump's VP? Maybe Because It's Smart Politics.
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/there_is_a_war_over_race_in_america_but_it_s_not_whites_vs_blacks.html	"Hours after a sniper gunned down five law enforcement officers in Dallas--claiming, according to police, that ""he wanted to kill white people, especially white officers""--no one was crowing louder than David Duke. ""All I warned about, sorry to say, is now happening,"" the former Klansman tweeted. ""There is war against Whites in America. A war of hate, racism, and violence against us!"" Duke circulated tweets by people who used the phrase ""black lives matter"" and celebrated the shootings. In a pitch to Donald Trump supporters, he added the hashtags #WarOnWhites, #ThanksObama, and #MakeAmericaGreatAgain. This is the central thing to understand about what happened in Dallas: Black people who target whites are fundamentally allied with white people who target blacks. They're on the same team: the race war team. It's a lot like the global struggle over jihadism, in which Muslims who hate Christians collaborate, in effect, with Christians who hate Muslims. In the case of jihadism, the real struggle isn't between two religions. It's between people who want religious war and people who don't. The same is true of race: Either you're on the race war team, or you're against it. The attack in Dallas--allegedly committed by Micah Johnson, a black man--comes barely a year after a white man, Dylann Roof, allegedly shot nine black people to death in a church in Charleston, South Carolina. Roof told friends, and later police, that he wanted ""to start a race war."" ""He wanted it to be white with white, and black with black,"" said a friend. Roof's manifesto echoed the ideas of Anders Behring Breivik, a white Christian nationalist who massacred 77 people in Norway five years ago. Breivik claimed to be defending ""our people, our culture, Christendom and our nation."" He declared, ""It is every European's duty to defend their people and country against the ideology of genocide, conquest and destruction known as Islam."" Nothing helps Roof, Breivik, Duke, and other white nationalists more than hate crimes by the people they vilify--blacks and Muslims--against whites, Christians, and police officers. No crime justifies such collective vilification. But as a social dynamic, haters and killers on all sides work together, by stoking feelings of group victimization and group vengeance. In December 2014, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, a black man, ambushed and killed two police officers in their squad car in New York City. One officer turned out to be Asian American; the other was Latino. Brinsley had previously expressed anger about police killings of two black men, Eric Garner and Michael Brown. Shortly before the attack, Brinsley posted a message on Instagram: ""I'm Putting Wings On Pigs Today They Take 1 Of Ours...... Let's Take 2 of Theirs #ShootThePolice."" In January 2016, Edward Archer, a black Muslim, ambushed and shot a white policeman in his patrol car in Philadelphia. Archer said he had targeted police because they enforced laws that violated Islam. ""I follow Allah,"" he told investigators. ""I pledge my allegiance to the Islamic State and that's why I did what I did."" Both cases were complicated by diffuse grievances and questions of mental health. Nevertheless, white racists exploited the shooting in New York, and Islamophobes exploited the shooting in Philadelphia. The cries for racial and religious war went beyond American borders. Breivik predicted that the European Union, by ""dismantling border controls"" against migrants, ""could become partly responsible for triggering civil wars in several European countries."" He concluded: ""We are in the very beginning of a very bloody cultural war, a war between nationalism and internationalism, and we intend to win it."" Roof, in his manifesto, expressed similar views. ""I saw that the same things were happening in England and France, and in all the other Western European countries,"" he wrote. ""Europe is the homeland of White people, and in many ways the situation is even worse there."" These visions of mortal struggle between a white West and its dark-skinned enemies mirror, almost precisely, the ideology of Islamic jihad. Look at Osama Bin Laden's pronouncements over the years, and you'll see a striking resemblance to the rhetoric of Newt Gingrich and Donald Trump. Both sides describe and promote a clash of religions, and this unites them in a global alliance against Christians and Muslims--including President Obama, former President George W. Bush, and King Abdullah of Jordan--who argue that the real enemy, terrorism, belongs to no religion. Twelve years ago, in a video message, Bin Laden gloated that it was ""easy for us to provoke and bait"" the United States into doomed wars in Muslim lands. Last month, after the massacre in Orlando, Florida, Trump embarked on a spree of anti-Muslim demagoguery  that played right into the strategy of religious polarization that had just been outlined by ISIS. This is the war Micah Johnson joined in Dallas on Thursday night. He didn't join the side of black people, any more than Bin Laden or ISIS joined the side of Muslims. He joined the side of tribal enmity and vengeance. He joined the side of Dylann Roof, Anders Breivik, and David Duke. It's the wrong side. Reject it.

20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/big_donors_are_keeping_a_low_profile_at_the_convention.html	"Protesters will shout. Delegates may revolt. Factions will haggle over rules and platform proposals. But come later this month, no amount of friction will stop corporations, unions, and special interests from spending tens of millions of dollars to bankroll nonstop partying at the Democratic and Republican national conventions. Thank federal campaign finance rules that allow unlimited contributions to support them. Special interests concerned about chaos under their corporate logos shouldn't fret. There are plenty of ways to show support for the quadrennial bacchanalias and discreetly secure access to lawmakers and political power players without earning unwanted attention. Certainly some high-profile companies and individual donors--the list includes billionaire Paul Singer, Apple, Coca-Cola, Microsoft, and Wal-Mart--are scaling back on giving to the host committees this time. Some reportedly want to distance themselves from controversies surrounding presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee-in-waiting, is also historically unpopular with the public and attempting to weather fallout from her State Department email imbroglio, in which the FBI this week deemed her conduct ""extremely careless"" but not worthy of criminal charges. Meanwhile, many special interests, from Comcast Corp. to financial giant JPMorgan Chase to insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield, will participate in convention-related activities. But they've become more creative in how they influence conventioneers--or are altogether refusing to discuss their convention plans. ""They want to show up, they want to rub elbows with everyone at the conventions, they just don't want the corporate name out there,"" said Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist for advocacy group Public Citizen, which has long tracked influence efforts at the conventions. ""They'll be looking for lower-key ways of doing the same thing they've always done."" The Center for Public Integrity contacted dozens of companies to inquire about their plans for contributing to the convention host committees or sponsoring private events at the collection. The companies include the largest contributors to both 2012 national conventions and the top 10 Fortune 500 companies. Many didn't respond to questions, and almost none would provide specific details about their 2016 convention involvement. But through public records and other sources, the Center for Public Integrity identified major sponsorship opportunities and big-time backers. One way to keep a lower profile is to sponsor a delegation. The Republican National Convention's Texas delegation offers sponsorship packages ranging from the $5,000 ""Bluebonnet Club"" to the $50,000 ""Lone Star Club""--something for every budget. Most packages include a certain number of passes to the convention and official delegation events, and the ability to book hotel rooms at the same hotel as the delegation, ensuring easy access. Public recognition also comes with a sponsorship. But this year, many sponsors don't want their names associated with supporting the Republican National Convention. ""Part of the package is that they're recognized, and some of them have chosen not to be recognized publicly,"" delegation consultant Beth Cubriel said, adding, ""they just want to be supportive of the delegates."" The sponsorships have been almost entirely snapped up, Cubriel said. Indeed, there's more than one way to support the conventions, and many routes are decidedly opaque. If you're a special interest that wants to make a splash, you have three main options: The most direct route is to give a six- or seven-figure contribution straight to the host committees--nonprofit organizations created to organize, host, and fund the convention. These contributions will be publicly disclosed, but not until 60 days after the event. Corporations and unions may give money directly to these committees. A second option, new this year, permits individuals and political committees to write checks directly to special ""convention accounts"" administered by the Democratic and Republican parties themselves. Political parties at one time received $18 million each in public funding for their conventions in addition to money earmarked for security. But Congress eliminated this funding in 2014. To make it up, lawmakers created special ""convention"" accounts for each political party allowing individuals to contribute $100,200 and political action committees to kick in $45,000. That's in addition to other contributions to the party. Corporations and unions may not give directly to these accounts, although political action committees they sponsor may do so. Republicans have so far raised roughly triple the amount of Democrats: more than $15 million so far this cycle through the end of May, compared to approximately $5 million. Those contributions are disclosed monthly. The DNC declined to comment on the new convention fundraising accounts. In a statement, the RNC said the money they raise ""will be used to defray the costs of putting on a national convention."" The third option: throw a private party for lawmakers and partisan bigwigs. Such affairs might fly under the radar--great for many attention-avoiding special interests in 2016--but they require all involved to follow a convoluted bunch of federal ethics rules. Approaches among influence peddlers vary. A host of Republican officeholders and eminences have announced they'll be skipping the Cleveland event this year, contributing to questions about whether large investments are worth it, especially since most companies like to support both conventions to the same degree. Kevin O'Neill, co-chair of the legislative practice group at law and lobbying firm Arnold and Porter, said clients have always gone through a process to evaluate the value of participating, and it's been declining. Now, O'Neill said, lobbying firm clients are concluding, ""If we're going we should have a smaller footprint, a smaller visibility, it should be very targeted, and we should do anything we can to steer our brand clear of controversy. You have two candidates here that have some high negatives, and that gives people pause."" Wal-Mart spokesman Greg Hitt said the company's political action committee is contributing $15,000 to the convention fund for each party this election cycle and won't be giving additional money to the host committees. Compare that to the $150,000 corporate contribution Wal-Mart gave to the host committee for the Republican convention in 2012. Singer, a major Republican donor, has also contributed to the party convention account, and gave the maximum $100,200 in 2015. Microsoft's PAC gave $15,000 to the DNC's convention account. Some companies that have contributed heavily in the past, such as FedEx, which gave $250,000 to the Republican convention in 2012, did not respond to multiple inquiries about their plans this year. Such circumstances don't make soliciting large donations any easier. But representatives of both parties' host committees say they're nevertheless closing in on their fundraising goals: $50 million for the Democratic host committee and $57 million for the Republicans. Representatives of both host committees acknowledge they're relying heavily on big corporations anchored in their host cities, which is typical. The strong regional appeal of conventions also means many big contributors from four years ago-- companies headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Tampa, Florida, for instance--aren't necessarily in the mix this time. By the time the Republican National Committee decided to award the convention to Cleveland, ""we had nearly $30 million in commitments and the vast majority were from northeast Ohio or other parts of Ohio,"" said David Gilbert, president and chief executive officer of the Cleveland 2016 Host Committee. Consider KeyCorp., the Cleveland-based parent company of Key Bank. Beth Mooney, the company's chairwoman and chief executive officer, is co-chair of the Cleveland host committee. So far, the company has disclosed contributing $333,333.33 to the host committee in 2015. Jack Sparks, director of communications for KeyCorp, did not respond to a question from the Center for Public Integrity about whether KeyCorp had given additional contributions to the host committee or planned to host private events. Sparks did say the company ""looks for innovative opportunities to help Cleveland and northeast Ohio to thrive"" and ""is proud to partner with the Cleveland 2016 Host Committee as the committee works to make the most of the national spotlight that will shine on Cleveland during the Republican National Convention."" Democratic convention organizers, meanwhile, are rebuilding their corporate base almost from scratch after prohibiting direct corporate, political action committee, and lobbyist donations during 2008 and 2012. Some companies still found ways to give, notably Duke Energy, which forgave millions of dollars in loans after the 2012 convention. But fundraisers for the Philadelphia host committee have had to convince many companies that putting the Democratic convention line item back in their budgets this year is a good idea. Unions, which constituted seven of the top 20 contributors to the host committee for the Charlotte convention in 2012, appear to again be stepping up for Democrats. At a National Press Club event in June highlighting preparations for the Democratic convention, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney and Kevin Washo, the host committee's executive director, said support from organized labor has been key. ""Organized labor has been at the forefront of this bid, both in terms of support financially and the commitment to the work that's being done at the arena,"" Washo said. The Bricklayers AFL-CIO reported contributing $1.35 million to the Philadelphia 2016 Host Committee in 2015, according to a filing with the U.S. Department of Labor. James Boland, president of the bricklayers' union, is an at-large member of the Democratic National Committee. Other unions have so far reported smaller contributions, including $50,000 from the plumbers' union and $10,000 from the Service Employees System Council. On the corporate front, David L. Cohen, a senior executive vice president at Comcast Corp., is a ""special adviser"" to the Philadelphia host committee, an informal but high-profile role. The PAC of Comcast, one of Philadelphia's most prominent corporate citizens, has given $45,000 to the convention funds for both parties, according to public filings. Comcast declined to answer questions about its contributions to the host committee or other arrangements tied to the convention, and refused to confirm plans for a party at the Barnes Foundation, a high-profile art museum. For another way to avoid controversy, take the approach adopted by JPMorgan Chase. In 2012, the company gave $200,000 directly to the host committee for the Republican convention in Tampa, according to host committee filings with the Federal Election Commission reviewed by the Center for Public Integrity. This time? The two host committees are apparently getting bupkis from the financial industry giant. Instead, JPMorgan Chase is giving $300,000 to nonprofits in Cleveland and Philadelphia in support of summer youth employment programs but linking the charitable contributions to the conventions. ""JPMorgan Chase decided that the best way to support these conventions was to support the cities themselves where the events will take place,"" JPMorgan Chase global government relations head Nate Gatten wrote in a blog post about the contributions. In press releases touting the charitable contributions, JPMorgan Chase first mentions the national conventions in the eighth paragraph of its Philadelphia press release and the seventh and last paragraph of its Cleveland release. Of course, much of the mingling between influencers and politicians takes place at private events: parties, concerts, hospitality suites. Those aren't simple to throw together. They're governed by a variety of ethics rules, including some that apply only to events conducted during the conventions. The rules, many passed in response to influence-peddling scandals, govern even small details and often seem illogical. Individual members can't be honored by special interests, for example, but delegations can. Senators can be billed as ""featured speakers,"" but House members cannot. The rules even cover the types of food that may be served. In other words, no dangling entire lobsters off toothpicks. Kenneth Gross, head of the political law practice at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom, and a veteran of the confusing tangle of rules governing convention events, quipped that he's stopped reviewing menus himself. ""I have a sous chef who does that,"" Gross joked. Seriously, though, this isn't a good area for misunderstandings. Not only are the rules technical, they aren't uniform. There are different restrictions for members of the U.S. House of Representatives than for senators, and states have their own ethics requirements. ""We remind people these conventions are not ethics-free zones,"" Gross said. Some observers, including Public Citizen's Holman and elections lawyer Brett Kappel, say they're seeing fewer signs of private events this time. Kappel says he hasn't received a single inquiry from clients seeking legal advice regarding holding events at, or in association with, the 2016 conventions. That's down from several inquiries four years ago. Rich Gold, head of law and lobbying firm Holland and Knight's public policy practice, said the firm is still nailing down its convention plans, but they will be more modest than in past years. For example, he said, the firm will co-host a dinner for Democratic mayors in Philadelphia. In 2012, he said, the firm's large office in Tampa and its representation of the city of Charlotte prompted it to hold much larger events with hundreds of guests and live performances. Clients, too, are taking a more muted approach, he said, given the turmoil this year. In addition to the tension on the Republican side, ""I just don't think ... given the major issues on the Democratic side now in terms of income inequality and CEO pay, that this is the time to have an outlandish presence,"" he said. ""People are trying to be more tasteful."" There are still plenty of schmoozefests to attend--if you know how to score an invite. For example, law firm Dentons is hosting events at both conventions--one honoring former DNC chairs Joe Andrew and Howard Dean at a rooftop garden in Philadelphia, and one spotlighting former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, according to an invite obtained by the Center for Public Integrity. All three men now work with Dentons, one of the world's largest law firms. Andrew serves as its global chairman. Political Party Time, the Sunlight Foundation database that tracks invitations to fundraisers, has so far obtained two convention party invites--one for a ""Sex, Politics, and Cocktails"" fundraiser for Planned Parenthood Action Fund at the Democratic National Convention and another offering sponsorship packages for the ""Republican All Star Challenge"" at Progressive Field in Cleveland, honoring Republican members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee as well as the Republican Congressional Baseball Team. (Yes, such a team exists, playing annually against Democrats in the name of charity.) Invitations for several other Cleveland events are making the rounds. The country band Rascal Flatts, which has Ohio roots, is headlining the ""Buckeye Welcome Bash,"" a July 18 reception in Cleveland sponsored by the Cleveland Clinic Educational Foundation and the Jones Day Foundation. The reception benefits the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center and honors Steve LaTourette, a former member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Ohio who is now chairman and chief executive officer of the Main Street Partnership, an advocacy group. The Jones Day Foundation is the charitable arm of the law firm Jones Day, which was founded in Cleveland and still has deep roots there. Of particular note: The Trump campaign's legal team is led by Jones Day lawyer and former Federal Election Commission Chairman Don McGahn. Jones Day partner Chris Kelly is a co-host of the Republican convention host committee in Cleveland. Jones Day did not respond to a request for comment. Country singer Kip Moore will headline a concert in Cleveland sponsored by the Republican Governors Association--and honoring Republican governors--and BGR Group, the lobbying firm headed by former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour. Sponsorship packages for the event are split into a $25,000 and $50,000 tiers, and include tickets, photo opportunities with Moore, sponsorship signage, and other benefits. Country duo Big and Rich is headlining another benefit concert; sponsor logos on the ""Make Housing Great Again"" invite include the Mortgage Bankers Association. There are also notices for a series of concerts planned to honor the House Republican Whip team, among others, that benefit a charity called Concerts for a Cause, which raises money for epilepsy-related causes. Another event, at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, will honor the Republican leadership and members of the U.S. Senate. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas and Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi are featured speakers, and the event will be sponsored by AFLAC, Blue Cross Blue Shield, and AT&T. When asked for comment, an AFLAC spokesman said the company is sponsoring events at both conventions, though he didn't give details. A spokesman for AT&T, which is the official communications and technology provider for both conventions, said the company supports them ""on an impartial basis."" Blue Cross Blue Shield did not respond to requests for comment. AT&T is also subsidizing free admission for all to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame during the Republican convention. In Philadelphia, there are signs that high-profile private venues are booking up. The Barnes Foundation, whose Philadelphia campus houses its world-famous art collection and offers a wide range of high-end event spaces, is ""nearly fully booked"" for private events during the convention, according to Deirdre Maher, the director of communications, who also said the convention has brought ""an uptick in interest."" And pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA Action, which has raised more than $88 million this election, will co-host a ""unity party"" at the Electric Factory, a storied Philadelphia music venue. Headlining the event? Rapper Snoop Dogg--a curious choice, given that his lyrics have frequently referred to women in a variety of derogatory ways. But Snoop Dogg promised in 2015 to never again call a woman a ""bitch"" or ""ho,"" and he has since endorsed Clinton, who has made women's rights a cornerstone issue of her campaign.

Big Donors Are Keeping a Low Profile at the Conventions. Why?
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/07/the_email_affair_was_the_perfect_hillary_clinton_scandal.html	"With FBI Director James Comey's tsk-tsking statement Tuesday morning, the email saga that had dogged Hillary Clinton for more than a year was over. It ended with a whimper, with an outcome that fit the facts on the ground. Back in April, Politico's Josh Gerstein looked at dozens of federal investigations into the mishandling of classified records in an effort to glean insight into the investigation of Clinton and her use of a private email server as secretary of state. His conclusion? That we wouldn't see an indictment. Which is precisely what happened. Clinton was scolded but not indicted. Democrats were relieved, Republicans were outraged, and holdout supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders were crushed. It's obvious now that the email controversy was the perfect Hillary Clinton scandal: an event of modest consequence that reinforces every belief about her, from burning conservative hostility to deep-seated liberal anxiety. The FBI's judgment sounds like a victory for Secretary Clinton. It wasn't. Yes, she escaped indictment, thus crossing one unknown from the list of unknowns that could lead to a Donald Trump victory in November. But Comey's assessment was harsh. By his measure, Clinton and her team at the State Department were ""extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information"" and that they ""should have known that an unclassified system was no place"" for discussing items classified ""highly sensitive"" or ""top secret."" What's more, Comey said, there's a real chance Clinton's server was compromised by foreign agents, underscoring the degree to which her behavior was reckless. If this were any other election, against any other Republican nominee for president, Comey's statement would be damaging, if not deadly. It would shine a light on Clinton's most glaring attribute: an unrelenting paranoia that leads to undue secrecy and legally permissible--if ethically dubious--decisions. In the hands of Marco Rubio or John Kasich or even Ted Cruz, it would be Exhibit A in the political case against Hillary Clinton. But that's a different world. Here on Earth Prime, Donald Trump is the Republican nominee for president, with an omnishambles campaign that's too busy dealing with its own failures to capitalize on any of Clinton's problems. Like some real-life Cobra Commander, Trump lacks the cash, personnel, or organizational skill to take advantage of Clinton's present weakness. Instead, the story will fade from view, as she claims vindication ahead of the Democratic National Convention. When she claims that vindication, however, Clinton will do so as a damaged candidate. There's a decent chance that without the email scandal--and in particular, without the steady drip of negative coverage around it--she would be in even stronger shape for the general election, with higher favorability numbers than she now holds. The scandal didn't tank Clinton's numbers as much as it held them down, so that the inevitable decline that comes with campaigning and fighting for political power was never tempered by positive press coverage of endorsements or proposals. For the past year, the story of Hillary Clinton in American politics has been negative: of secrecy, of scofflaw behavior, and (thanks to the Sanders campaign) of ""establishment politics"" and Wall Street ties. Some of this is unfair, a product of Clinton's tense and adversarial relationship with the press and other groups in American politics. But some of it--perhaps a good deal of it--is self-inflicted. Hillary Clinton has been the target of unfair investigations and wasteful witch hunts. Far from instilling caution, however, that scrutiny has inspired a cavalier attitude toward rules and norms and general propriety. It's why Clinton didn't think to follow the letter and spirit of the rules with regard to email. It's why, after leaving the State Department, she didn't think to avoid investment banks when she went on the circuit to speak. This just creates more trouble, which reinforces that cavalier attitude, as Clinton's political enemies inevitably overreach. In watching this dynamic unfold, observers bring their baggage and their prejudices. Conservatives can't help but think this proves their beliefs about Clinton and ""the Clintons,"" about their inherent corruption and their disdain for rules. And despite their deep misgivings, liberals can't help but come to their defense against those conservatives, hoping that it won't happen again, resigning themselves to the fact that it will. The email scandal has had something for everyone. And now it's over. Will it be the end of the Clinton dynamic for 2016? Looking at the material that still hasn't had a hearing in this election. Probably not. Read more Slate coverage of the Democratic primary."	The Email Affair Was the Perfect Hillary Clinton Scandal
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/can_donald_trump_even_count_on_a_convention_polling_bounce.html	"It's not news that Donald Trump trails Hillary Clinton in national polling. As of Thursday, he's down 44.6 percent to 39.8 percent in the RealClearPolitics polling average, down 45.5 percent to 38.6 percent in the HuffPost Pollster average, and down 44 percent to 39 percent points in the New York Times average. Swing state polls tell a similar story, with Trump down in almost every state that's up for grabs in November. Now, there's a caveat here. Compared with spring or fall, the early summer is the least reliable period for presidential election polls. The reasoning is simple: Often, the two parties are still sorting out tensions and divisions from their primaries. Depending on the shape and tenor of their contests, one side might be more unified than the other, which produces an imbalance. We saw this in late May when Trump tied or led Clinton in several general election polls. But this made sense as Clinton was still engaged in a divisive nomination fight, alienating Democrats who would otherwise back her campaign against a Republican. And the real estate mogul had just cinched the nomination, yielding a post-primary bounce as he consolidated support across the party. But ""least reliable"" doesn't mean unreliable, and at this stage, the polls are telling a new story. At the same time that Clinton has started to unify the Democratic Party ahead of its convention, Trump has done the reverse. Now, as much as ever, the Republican Party is divided and fractious on the question of its nominee. And in this case, it may not get better. More than half of Republicans want someone else to lead their party in the fall, according to a new Fox News survey of the electorate, with the greatest anti-Trump sentiment among Republican women and Republicans with college degrees. Overall, as Phillip Bump shows for the Washington Post, using data from HuffPost Pollster, Trump wins an average of around 80 percent of Republicans, down from May when his support among co-partisans reached the mid-80s. Hillary Clinton, by contrast, wins close to 86 percent of Democrats. Likewise, according to a new survey of swing states by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, a Democratic polling firm, Clinton has consolidated 89 percent of Democrats while Trump holds only 80 percent of Republicans. In a national election, a difference in party unity of five or six percentage points can be dispositive, especially if one candidate is winning a higher-than-normal number of voters on the other side. And that's where Clinton stands: She pulls around 8 percent of Republicans, while Trump wins around 5 percent of Democrats. Once again, however, it's only July. The conventions--where nominees are buffed and shined and celebrated in primetime--haven't happened yet. Republicans could remember that they're Republicans and return to Trump's column in a spasm of post-convention partisan loyalty. And indeed, this is what we would see if Trump were more like a typical candidate. The problem for his campaign, and for the GOP writ large, is that he's extremely atypical. In addition to his erratic behavior and offensive, often demagogic rhetoric (the attacks on federal Judge Gonzalo Curiel are exhibit A here), Trump rejects the Republican consensus on economic policy, and is silent on issues of abortion and same-sex marriage. He's made little effort to assuage or appeal to party donors and faces a backlash from skittish party elites. Some delegates want to derail Trump at the convention, while dozens of prominent Republicans, from senators and governors to ex-presidents and former nominees, just aren't attending. Mitt Romney is loudly anti-Trump, as are other GOP heavyweights. John Kasich is still governor of Ohio and he's not attending the convention, which Republicans are holding in Cleveland. Far from a coronation of Trump, there's every indication that this convention will be a bonanza of chaos and confusion. This matters. If a normal convention boosts party unity by activating and celebrating partisan identity, a chaotic one corrodes it by highlighting anger and division in the ranks. Most nominees receive a boost after they officially claim the nomination: It stabilizes the race and sets the stage for the fall. In fact, it's the August after the convention when polls reach their most stable and reliable state. Donald Trump, however, might be the exception. Without a weeklong endorsement from Republican stars and luminaries--and with wide coverage of any division and disruption--there's a strong chance that Trump gains nothing from his convention. It might even hurt him. It's not out of the question that, come the fall, the Republican Party will be less unified than it is now. If there's a reason to discount this, it's the campaign itself. Rallies, advertising, and surrogates could make up the difference, reminding Republican voters of their loyalties and heightening the election's stakes. But Trump isn't running a real campaign, is he? With little staff, little cash, and little advertising, he's done almost nothing to rebut the tens of millions in pro-Clinton spending. Trump may have an iron grip on cable news, but that's of limited help when the coverage is almost always negative, and when it doesn't counteract the harsh and relentless blitz from Team Clinton. In the coming months, Americans will hear all the reasons they shouldn't vote for Donald Trump from figures across the political spectrum, as Democrats and Republicans speak out against his candidacy. And Trump, it's clear, isn't ready or able to do anything about it. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Can Trump Even Count on a Convention Polling Bounce?
23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/bernie_sanders_blew_it.html	"On Monday, Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren campaigned together in Cincinnati. Their message was clear: Donald Trump is a ""thin-skinned bully who is driven by greed and hate,"" as Warren put it, and the Democratic Party can deliver the policies and investments to improve life for ordinary Americans. But more interesting than their rhetoric was the event's tone and tenor. Warren was a compelling surrogate, giving Clinton the kind of strong and affirmative endorsement she needs to win over skeptical voters. And Clinton, in turn, was energized, touting her policies and platform--and indicting Trump for his attitudes and behavior. It was a grand display of party unity: Warren and Clinton, the left and the center-left, united against a common foe and cheered on by thousands of excited Democrats, all ready for the general election. And where was Bernie Sanders? Two weeks ago, after the Democratic primary's official end, the Vermont senator gave a campaign speech that had all the trappings of a concession but lacked the part where he actually conceded. In it, he celebrated the size, scope, and success of his insurgent bid, spoke a little about cooperation with Clinton, and went on to affirm his efforts to reform the Democratic Party. ""I also look forward to working with Secretary Clinton to transform the Democratic Party so that it becomes a party of working people and young people, and not just wealthy campaign contributors,"" Sanders said. ""[A] party that has the courage to take on Wall Street, the pharmaceutical industry, the fossil-fuel industry, and the other powerful special interests that dominate our political and economic life."" Sanders wasn't going to be the Democratic nominee, but he still held a good amount of leverage in the form of his voters. After a tough primary, they were hesitant to back Clinton, a fact apparent in the polls. Clinton stood ahead of Donald Trump, but not by much: Her lead was weakened by the party's unbridged divisions. By holding off on a concession and an endorsement, the Vermont senator was keeping this leverage in reserve ahead of the Democratic National Convention. It made sense. Still, it was a risky move. Whatever influence or leverage Sanders had was tied to his voters. As long as they stuck with him--and didn't move to Clinton--he could make demands and win concessions on items like the Democratic Party's platform, a key object of his rhetoric over the past month. But if his voters moved without his endorsement, either pushed by fear of Trump or support from other Democrats, then the value of his support would fall accordingly. Which is what happened. In his nonconcession speech, Sanders told supporters their ""major political task"" was to ""make certain that Donald Trump is defeated and defeated badly."" It turns out that was the message that landed. In the most recent poll from ABC News and the Washington Post, Clinton leads Trump 51 percent to 39 percent, expanding her previous lead by 5 points, as Trump has seen a complete collapse in his support. And what's driving the move toward Clinton? Democrats and independents who supported Bernie Sanders. In May, 20 percent of Sanders supporters said they would back Trump over Clinton in the general election. In June, that number is down to 8 percent. Overall, 81 percent of Sanders backers have rallied to Clinton, surpassing the 74 percent of Clinton supporters in 2008 who fell in behind Barack Obama. By any measure, the Democratic Party is unified. Sanders' endorsement isn't irrelevant, but it now carries less weight, and the leverage he held at the end of the primary just isn't there anymore. Take the Democratic platform. The good news for Team Sanders is that its advocates--like Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison--have put Social Security expansion and the $15-an-hour minimum wage into the party document, as well as a call for an ""updated and modernized version of Glass-Steagall,"" the Depression-era law that prohibited commercial banks from engaging in investment banking activities. At the same time, these are areas of wide Democratic agreement. Most Democrats support Social Security expansion and a substantially higher minimum wage, up to and including $15-an-hour. These aren't concessions. On those points that are more contentious, Team Sanders has lost out. The platform committee has rejected Sanders' language on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, his stance against the Trans-Pacific Partnership, his call for a carbon tax, and his total opposition to fracking. Maybe this was inevitable. Maybe Sanders was never going to have the full stamp he clamored for simply on account of having lost. But this underplays the initial strength of his hand. Had Sanders endorsed Clinton at the end of the primaries and recalibrated as an advocate for her campaign--in short, had he mimicked Warren--he would have gotten ahead of his voters. This is important. With an early concession and endorsement, Sanders does two things: He pre-empts any natural movement to Clinton among Democratic primary voters, which lets him claim credit for her improved numbers even if they were inevitable. Like Warren, he would take a starring role in the campaign against Trump. And as we saw in 2008 between Obama and Clinton, a partnership can open the doors to lasting influence. As it stands, the Vermont senator has almost vanished from the news cycle, overshadowed by Clinton's growing lead, overall Democratic unity, global events, and the never-ending emissions of Donald Trump. He'll still matter to the shape and direction of the Democratic National Convention, but he could have had a larger, more visible role. Bernie Sanders had his shot, and he threw it away.

24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/should_hillary_clinton_pick_elizabeth_warren_for_vice_president.html	"Will America see its first all-female ticket for the White House? The signs are strong. Hillary Clinton is the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is most everyone's favorite pick for the vice presidential slot, despite some very good reasons she shouldn't be on the ticket. Not only is she under heavy consideration from the Clinton campaign--which is ""vetting"" her, along with Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro--but she's been at the forefront of the Democratic push against Donald Trump and a strong advocate for the former secretary of state. The same day President Obama endorsed Clinton as his successor, for instance, Warren did the same in an interview with MSNBC. But that was after she attacked Trump in a merciless address to the American Constitution Society, calling him a ""disgrace"" and concluding with a brutal slam. ""[W]e will not allow a small, insecure, thin-skinned wannabe tyrant or his allies in the Senate to destroy the rule of law in the United States of America,"" she said. Last week, Warren visited Team Clinton offices in Brooklyn to give a pep talk, and earlier Monday she could be found at a campaign event in the swing state of Ohio, joining hands with Clinton. Rhetoric and optics aside, the substantive case for Warren is good. For Clinton, she helps bridge the gap with Bernie Sanders and his supporters, giving skeptical progressives a positive reason to back the Democratic Party's nominee. Likewise, with her anti-Wall Street message and her work on consumer advocacy, she brings a populist edge to the Clinton ticket, offsetting a weakness that harmed Clinton in the primaries and could do the same in the general. And if part of the Democrats' anti-Trump strategy is putting his misogyny into sharp focus, then a two-woman ticket is ideal. There's also the sheer history of it all. To have two women on a major party ticket for president of the United States--after 228 years of only male presidents--would be a remarkable shift in American politics and an enormous symbolic victory for gender equality.* It's difficult to say what it would mean for the nuts and bolts of the election. But it would stand as a powerful moment in our history, on par with Obama's election. But there are serious downsides to Warren, and just as critically, for Warren. To start, a Warren pick risks violating the cardinal rule of the ""veepstakes"": Do no harm. A vice presidential pick should neither overshadow the top of the ticket nor jeopardize control of Congress. For all of her virtues, Warren might do both. On the former count, the Massachusetts senator is a star in her own right, with a substantial following independent of the larger Democratic Party. A Clinton-Warren ticket could easily become a Warren-Clinton one in practice, which is not something a presidential nominee wants. (Ask John McCain.) This might be a risk worth taking if Warren could be replaced by another Democrat in the Senate, but that's an open question. If chosen, Massachusetts' Republican governor would pick Warren's replacement. It wouldn't be permanent--the state has to hold a special election after roughly five months--but it risks handing an otherwise safe Democrat seat to the GOP, which adds a serious impediment to the party's agenda, should it win the White House in November without capturing the House of Representatives. In that (likely) world, President Clinton would be working her will through the executive branch and would need a Senate with as many Democrats as possible to confirm her nominees. And if, somehow, Democrats capture the House, they'll need as large a Senate margin as they can manage to overcome any Republican filibuster. Obama's choice of Joe Biden is instructive. Biden was a senator from solid-blue Delaware, and there was no chance that picking him would jeopardize the Democrats' hold on the chamber. Biden ""balanced the ticket,"" offsetting Obama's youth; relative inexperience; and, frankly, his race. But most importantly, Biden was an able partner for Obama, managing key projects like the stimulus, advising the president on national security decisions, and standing as a strong advocate for the administration's policies. Biden had no apparent trouble in the role of subordinate, and it made him more versatile and valuable in the role. In Warren's case, the vice presidency could be valuable if she's empowered to make crucial bureaucratic and regulatory decisions. It's not hard to imagine a Vice President Warren who acts as a watchdog within the administration, pushing Clinton to find and hire aggressive regulators and reject Wall Street-sourced appointees. But this would be an unusual amount of freedom for a vice president not named Dick Cheney. Given the extent to which the modern vice president is something like a chief advocate--responsible for pressing, negotiating, and enforcing the president's agenda--Warren could find herself bound to Clinton's agenda and priorities, even when she disagrees, leaving her with less autonomy than she had in the Senate. In which case, progressives will have lost one of their most able and vocal champions with little in return. There's real symbolism in ""Warren for vice president,"" but it may hurt progressives in the long term to have her in a presidential administration versus in the Senate, where her advocacy has long and impressive reach. (The same, incidentally, goes for another vice presidential contender, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, a strong progressive choice who would be replaced by a Republican if he left the Senate.) There are other options. The aforementioned Kaine has a vice presidential resume (former governor, current senator), deep ties in the Democratic Party (he served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee), and is in step with the party and its liberals on most issues. He won't excite Sanders or his supporters like Warren might, but he is a safe choice whose departure from the Senate wouldn't harm the party's majority (Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe would choose his replacement). Castro is young and talented with views on the liberal side of the mainstream. He adds a touch of youth (although that comes with the distinct downside of inexperience) and heightens the symbolism of the Democratic Party's ticket: If elected, Clinton would serve as the first  female president of the United States and Castro as its first Hispanic American vice president. The ""dark horse"" choice, if there is one, is Labor Secretary Tom Perez, a longtime member of the Obama administration (he previously served as head of the civil rights division of the Justice Department) with strong bureaucratic skills and a real following among progressive activists and advocates. Of all the possible picks, he might be the closest thing to a middle ground, someone acceptable to all factions in the Democratic Party, a Latino politician with symbolic appeal who is amenable to skeptics on the left of the campaign. In all of this gaming and strategizing, however, it's worth remembering one important point: Whoever the vice presidential nominee is, he or she won't change the game. In general, the vice presidential nominee has no more than a modest effect on the final outcome. Other than John Kennedy in the 1960 election (who in part owed his victory to Lyndon Johnson's popularity in the South), presidents don't win or lose on the basis of whom they picked to run on their tickets. Which means that, as Clinton weighs her choice, she shouldn't spend too much on the politics. What counts is whether he or she can do the job, however defined, without leaving unfillable holes in his or her previous posts. Everything beyond that is just window dressing. *Update, June 28, 2016: This sentence has been updated to clarify that the 228 years of only men refers to the U.S. presidency.

25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/embattled_whiteness_gave_us_brexit_it_won_t_give_us_president_trump.html	"If there's a dominant narrative in the story of the Brexit referendum, it's the anger and disenchantment of working-class voters, who largely backed the ""Leave"" campaign and by extension its most vocal advocate, Nigel Farage, leader of the U.K. Independence Party. UKIP is Euroskeptic and anti-immigration, a party that caters to racism and xenophobia, especially in the face of rapid and rising immigration to the United Kingdom. Immigration has altered the social fabric of the country at the same time that globalization, austerity, and financial capitalism have undermined the industries and institutions of working-class life. Farage speaks the language of the anxious to Britons who feel threatened and dislocated. And immigrants are his chief target. It's why, for instance, he warned that Muslim migrants were a potential ""fifth column"" that threatened British society. ""There is an especial problem with some of the people who've come here and who are of the Muslim religion who don't want to become part of our culture,"" he said in a 2015 interview. ""People do see a fifth column living within our country, who hate us and want to kill us."" All of this carried over to the ""Leave"" campaign. In the course of his advocacy, Farage warned Britons that continued European integration would bring waves of Turkish immigrants and Syrian migrants. He claimed that the EU had all but stolen from British workers by channeling to the continent funds that could be used to fix the National Health Service. Last week, he unveiled a poster that echoed the racist imagery of fascist propaganda, with its specter of a Britain overtaken by impoverished, brown-skinned refugees. And actual British voters identified the ""Leave"" campaign with efforts to stop or curtail immigration to the United Kingdom. The results--a win for ""Leave"" and for Farage--speak for themselves. ""This will be a victory for real, decent people,"" Farage said when it was clear his side would carry the day in the referendum. In the final result, the oldest Britons--those most dismayed by the economic and social changes in British society--backed ""Leave."" The youngest rejected it. It's not hard to see why Americans would watch this with fascination. For the past year, we've been transfixed with our own version of this right-wing, anti-immigrant backlash in the form of Donald Trump, who will be the Republican Party's nominee for president of the United States. Trump hopes to get to the White House by riding the anger of working- and middle-class whites--or at least a substantial portion of them--who oppose mass immigration and feel similarly alienated from the rapid shifts in American culture. Some, like their counterparts in the U.K., are the victims of globalization and the financialization of American capitalism. There's no place for their labor and no substitute for their work. Others have prospered but still feel the sting of alienation. Either way, their political lives are increasingly defined by anti-elite anger, perceived racial threat (from Muslims and from immigrants), and profound cultural loss, all tied together by a sense of deep betrayal by their leaders. It's what Farage has tapped into, and it's what Trump has tapped into. Both have used it to their advantage. What Brexit suggests, to many American commentators, is that Trump could in fact win. Despite our differences with the U.K., writes Andrew Prokop for Vox, ""the Brexit result should jolt American liberals out of any complacence they may feel about Trump's candidacy."" Amy Davidson echoed this in the New Yorker. ""The Brexit results are a strong warning for anyone complacent about Donald Trump,"" she wrote. I'm skeptical. What's striking about the results of the EU referendum is the extent to which they matched the polls. Every survey of Brexit showed a close race between the two sides--a coin toss. The balance of the polls suggested a narrow--but far from dispositive--lead for ""Remain."" The final result was in line with the projection: a contest with no clear advantage for either side in which ""Leave"" won an extremely modest victory. Here in the United States, our polls show a substantial Trump loss in the general election against Hillary Clinton, just as they showed a substantial Trump win in the Republican presidential primaries. The chief reason is that, unlike the U.K., the U.S. has a large voting population of nonwhites: Latinos, black Americans, Asian Americans, etc. In Britain, ""black and minority ethnic"" people make up about 8 percent of the electorate. By contrast, people of color account for nearly 1 in 3 American voters. In practice, this means that in the past two national elections, there has been an electoral penalty for embracing the most reactionary elements of national life. And we see this in the polling between Trump and Clinton. If the United States were largely white--if its electorate were as monochromatic as Britain's--then Trump might have the advantage. As it stands, people of color in America are acting as a firewall for liberalism--an indispensable barrier to this surge of ethno-nationalism. Complacency isn't called for, but confidence isn't wrong either. But the success of Brexit demonstrates the degree to which ""Trumpism""--the anger and resentment stemming from a mixture of xenophobia, racism, and economic dislocation--is a global phenomenon, and one that won't subside even if he loses in November. That toxic stew will still simmer. It's tempting to view it all through a lens of ideology, where these battles represent an ascending movement of the right, a backlash against neoliberal economics, and a failure of left-wing politics to forge solidarity among working people. All of these are true in their own ways and play a part in the story. But just as vital is the role of race and, specifically, ""whiteness"" as a political category. The development of Western society over the past 300 years has occurred against a backdrop of racist domination, in which people of color were (and are) deliberately excluded from political and economic rights reserved for those persons deemed ""white"" (as distinct from European ancestry). All men might be created equal, but this normative equality didn't extend to black or native Americans, just as it didn't extend to those in South America, just as it didn't extend to Africans or South Asians under colonial rule, just as it didn't extend to Southeast Asians under the same. It's how the same men who preached freedom could justify slavery and native extermination, how those who defended liberty could starve millions. This racial hierarchy is still with us and still powerful, albeit attenuated in the face of broad taboos and the dismantling of official white supremacy. It continues to shape larger beliefs about citizenship and inclusion. Who really counts as an American? Who really counts as a Briton? Look no further than Trump's attacks on Gonzalo Curiel, the American-born judge in the case against Trump University. For Trump, Curiel is a ""Mexican,"" and thus not American enough to be dispassionate in his judgment. Or, for an older vintage, see the brief right-wing push to end ""birthright citizenship"" in the United States. In the United States, ""whiteness"" was the key to unlocking a broad array of social and economic benefits, provided to you as long as you could find the door (this despite the courageous work of leftists and radicals, black and white, in challenging those racial barriers). The same was true of other Western nations, where whiteness was a necessary (but not the only) factor in gaining access to new entitlements of citizenship. It's not hard to see how global capitalism and the elevation of financial markets have transformed the world over the past 30 years, upending our societies in ways we're still trying to grapple with. What's less obvious is the extent to which global capitalism has also upended racial hierarchies by degrading whatever material benefits accrue to those deemed ""white."" For as much as capitalist economies entrench racial inequality, the logic of capital doesn't especially care. It will impoverish black, white, and brown all the same. Trump supporters are largely white Americans. Brexit backers are largely white Britons. And on both sides, they're older, often elderly. In addition to everything else--all of the particular concerns of particular communities in the United States and the United Kingdom--we are witnessing a backlash to the weakening of a hierarchy that gave real status to people at the top, that protected them from the whims of capital or gave them prime social status as the expense of nonwhites. There are a million caveats here, and I'm obviously flattening too many dynamics to name. But it's important to place race at the center of this story, as part of the bundle of factors and trends and stories that are driving a new wave of nationalist anger from whites--or people deemed ""white""--on both sides of the Atlantic. Both Trump and Brexit are part of an anti-elite backlash. But it's not a backlash against the economic arrangement, per se. The older workers and pensioners who backed ""Leave"" are handing power to men of capital like Boris Johnson and Farage, a former commodities trader; the working and middle-class whites who back Trump, if they succeed, will hand power to a longtime financial elite, leading a party that bends fully to the prerogatives of financial elites. No, this is a backlash against the cosmopolitanism of those elites, against the belief that they broke the contract that upheld the relative social and economic status of people like them. If you're on the left, this is a backlash for all the wrong reasons. This is critical. In our fixation on these dislocated whites, we forget those that haven't embraced backlash. And in the United States, at least, we forget that the world of disadvantaged working people includes millions of people of color. They too have been harmed--often irreparably--by the march of financial capitalism and the weakening of the social safety net (if they even had access to it). But they reject the overtures of demagogues. Which is a reminder that, for as much as workers are circumscribed by forces out of their control, they aren't pawns of history. They can still make choices. Nativism is one choice. We don't have to respect it. Read more Slate coverage of the Brexit vote."	Embattled Whiteness Gave Us Brexit. It Won't Give Us President Trump.

There was something poignant about Blair's reaction, which managed to be calm, measured, and anguished all at the same time. One gets the sense Blair understands, on a gut level, that Britain's rejection of the EU is a rejection of his worldview. Perhaps he can take some solace in the fact that he is not alone. Like most leading figures in the worlds of politics and business, Blair favored remaining in the European Union. As prime minister during the 1990s, he often made the case for deeper European integration. More broadly, Blair proved himself to be among the most emphatically cosmopolitan world leaders in recent history. Within the Labour Party, Blair has since been repudiated by a base that fiercely rejects his brand of economic liberalism and will never forgive him for his decision to back the war in Iraq. Both commitments were, in very different ways, a reflection of Blair's belief in a more internationalist Britain, one that would shed its imperial past and embrace a new one as a multicultural society at home in the world. To that end, Blair also presided over the opening of Britain's borders to immigrants. Since 1997, when the Labour Party, under his leadership, swept into office in a landslide, British society has been transformed by a wave of immigration unprecedented in its history. Over the following years, roughly twice as many immigrants arrived in the United Kingdom as had arrived in the previous half-century. Many who arrived during that earlier era hailed from the Caribbean and South Asia, and by the early 1990s, 7 percent of England and Wales' population belonged to ethnic minorities. By now, that share has grown to over 14 percent. This, more than anything else, has been Tony Blair's legacy, and it is a legacy his successors Gordon Brown and David Cameron have been grappling with ever since. In Britain's less-diverse, pre-Blair past, political conflict was more or less straightforwardly driven by class conflict. The Tories were the party of the rich, the shires, and the aspirational working class, while Labour represented the working class and a thick slice of Britain's credentialed professionals. Class still matters in post-Blair Britain, but so too does the widening divide between cosmopolitans who embrace Britain's post-Blair transformation and nationalists who do not. David Cameron has long tried to straddle this divide: The EU referendum's result is a testament to his failure. To understand Britain's demographic transformation, it is important to understand that it has been unevenly distributed. Immigrants and their children have long been heavily concentrated in London, and southeastern England, and a handful of cities in the Midlands. London in particular feels ever more like a post-national metropolis. The white Britons who live there today are generally those most comfortable with cosmopolitanism and ethnocultural diversity. Those who've left are generally less so. Over the past decade, however, members of ethnic minority populations have been settling outside of Britain's urban centers in ever-larger numbers. Eric Kaufmann, a scholar of nationalism and its relationship to demographic change, observed that the white British population is particularly sensitive to the rate of immigration. When an immigrant influx is relatively gradual, resistance to immigration is limited. When it occurs very rapidly, the level of resistance intensifies and support for explicitly anti-immigration parties like the U.K. Independence Party (UKIP) increases. What does this have to do with the European Union? One of the EU's core principles is freedom of movement: EU citizens have the right to live and work in any EU member state. When a number of countries in Eastern and central Europe joined the EU, most existing member states put temporary limits in place on the freedom of movement to ensure they wouldn't experience a large and potentially disruptive influx of new arrivals. Blair's government decided not to do so on the assumption that immigration from the new member states would be relatively modest. In fact, immigration from the new member states far surpassed the government's projections. It was around this time that the politics of immigration in Britain entered a new phase. Ever since the 1960s, when large-scale Commonwealth immigration sparked intense controversy, the Conservatives have been seen as the more anti-immigration party. And during the Blair years, Conservatives struggled to shake their image as narrow-minded bigots. Just over three-fourths of the immigrants who've arrived in Britain since 1990 have been from outside the European Union; among the British elite, at least, anti-immigration sentiment has long been seen as a proxy for racism against nonwhites. In more recent years, however, the challenges presented by mass European immigration complicated this neat picture of the prejudiced Conservative. Early on, David Cameron recognized that doubts about uncontrolled immigration were no longer limited to older white traditionalists who could be dismissed, fairly or otherwise, as motivated by racial resentment. Once the less-skilled immigrants at the heart of the immigration debate were Poles and Bulgarians rather than blacks and South Asians, one could more credibly argue that anti-immigration sentiment was driven by concerns about the fiscal and environmental impacts of immigration, not a blind hatred of outsiders. And the last decade or so has indeed seen Britain become a highly sought-after destination for less-skilled European immigrants, thanks to the structure of the U.K.'s economy and its public policies. Recently, Martin Ruhs, an expert on international labor migration based at Oxford University, argued that free movement across the European Union is greatly complicated by the fact that different member states have different approaches to labor market regulation and the welfare state. First, countries with lightly regulated labor markets are generally more attractive to less-skilled immigrants than countries with tightly regulated labor markets, because high minimum wages and rigid limits on work hours tend to price less-skilled workers, native- or foreign-born, out of jobs. This is why there are so many less-skilled, non-European immigrants desperate to enter Britain from France--a country no less prosperous or safe than Britain-- where it is far harder for immigrants to get on the labor market's bottom rungs. Second, there are some European countries with welfare states that demand years of contributions before one can start drawing benefits and others where prior contributions are not generally required. Less-skilled immigrants to countries with noncontributory welfare states can start drawing benefits fairly quickly, regardless of their contribution. Britain is one such country: Under Tony Blair, Britain greatly expanded the use of refundable tax credits as a tool for poverty reduction, and this strategy has been wildly successful. But under EU rules, Hungarian newcomers are just as entitled to these benefits as, say, a poor Welshman. Regardless of whether this is a good idea, it is easy to see why some Britons find it frustrating. The only way Britain can make itself less attractive to less-skilled European immigrants is by imposing labor market regulations and welfare reforms that would apply to everyone, including less-skilled British workers. If we're going to curb welfare spending, some British voters are asking, why not start with European immigrants who've just showed up on our doorstep? If the European Union requires Britons and other EU citizens be treated the same, why not leave the EU and be done with it? As opposition leader, and later as prime minister, Cameron did much to legitimize doubts about mass immigration. He also pledged to drastically reduce net migration to the U.K. on explicitly nonracial grounds. The trouble is that while Britain could restrict non-European immigration, it could not limit European immigration without flouting EU rules. Since Cameron came to power in 2010, European immigration as a share of total immigration has crept upward for precisely this reason. Europe's economic malaise and Britain's robust labor market recovery has made it all but impossible for Cameron to hit his overly ambitious immigration targets. Recognizing that his failure on immigration made him vulnerable, Cameron tried desperately to persuade other member states to allow Britain to change the rules. But he met with implacable resistance from the leaders of newer member states in central and Eastern Europe, who resented the suggestion that their citizens be treated any differently than Britons. This left Cameron dangerously exposed: Having made the case for why Britain should have more control over European immigration, Cameron's failure to actually wrest that control from his European partners made him look more than a little ridiculous. All leading Brexiteers like Boris Johnson and Michael Gove had to do was point out that Cameron had failed to deliver. Right now, the partisans of ""Remain"" are damning the likes of Johnson and Gove for Brexit. However, it is not at all clear if they are the ones to blame for Remain's defeat. Had Cameron managed to secure a solid commitment from the European Union to do something as simple as limit the access European immigrants had to British welfare state benefits for, say, two or three years, Remain almost certainly would have won.* Instead, Cameron's friends and allies in Europe left him out to dry. What will Britain look like in the wake of Brexit? One possibility is that it will be awfully similar. If Britain leaves the EU merely to become a member of the looser and more-inclusive European Economic Area, it may well be subject to the same freedom of movement rules--while having even less say over Europewide policies. Or perhaps Britain will truly attempt to forge its own path in the name of Corbyn-ite socialism or UKIP-style populism. The only thing we can safely say is that the Blair era has finally and definitively come to a close. *Update, June 24, 2016: This sentence has been updated to clarify that although Cameron failed to secure the four-year ban on benefits for EU migrants he had sought, other EU member states did promise to work with him on phasing in in-work benefits.

27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/brexit_is_just_the_beginning_the_eu_blew_it.html	"A few weeks ago, I sat on a horse-drawn cart lumbering over a potholed bridge that felt less like the divide between two countries than between two political realities. I had spent the week reporting in Abkhazia, a breakaway Russian-backed separatist region of Georgia recognized as independent only by Moscow and a handful of other governments. Cars aren't allowed across the disputed border between Abkhazia and Georgia, hence the horse carts to carry travelers and their baggage across the 1-kilometer no-man's land. As we made our way across, I asked one of my fellow travelers, a local, which side of the border he lived on. ""In Georgia,"" he replied. ""In Europe!"" Georgia is not a member of the European Union, or even a candidate for membership, though it signed an ""association agreement"" in 2014. But EU flags are everywhere, from the airport to government buildings in the capital, Tbilisi, to the border with Abkhazia. The flags don't symbolize the country's current status but, rather, its aspirations. In many of the countries that broke free from Soviet domination, and are now fighting to stay outside the sphere of influence of Vladimir Putin's Russia, the EU flag is a powerful symbol. It was the issue of European integration, after all, that brought Ukrainians, many carrying EU flags, out onto the streets to topple their pro-Moscow government in 2013. For these protesters, and my companion in the back of the horse cart, Europe stands for democracy, good governance, and freedom of movement. But Europe obviously looks quite different when viewed from the West rather than the East. For the Britons who voted last night to pull their country out of the European Union, Europe stands for the surrender of political sovereignty to a faceless and bloated foreign bureaucracy, and the loss of cultural identity thanks to uncontrolled immigration. Even its supporters have to admit that it has done little to counteract this perception in recent years. The British public, or at least the English public, has always been skeptical about European integration, and the country had already kept the EU at arm's length, never signing on for the common currency or the passport-free travel zone. But the U.K. certainly isn't the only country where euro-fatigue has set in, and likely won't be the last country to hold this type of vote. Populist anti-EU parties, including the Dutch Freedom Party and France's National Front, are already calling for their own countries to hold membership referendums. Many of these parties are growing in influence, but as Britain's U.K. Independence Party has demonstrated, they don't even necessarily have to take power: They can simply pressure mainstream political parties into adopting their positions. The prospect of European countries rushing toward the exits should be an alarming one: For all its flaws, the EU is among the most impressive political achievements of our time. Mock the overpaid, pampered eurocrats and silly banana regulations all you want, it's hard to argue with the fact that after a half-century of carnage that dwarfs today's Middle East conflicts, not to mention the centuries of war that preceded it, Western Europe has been at peace for 70 years. The carrots and sticks of EU membership are also a large part of the reason that Spain, Greece, and the formerly Communist countries of central Europe are now consolidated democracies. The mere fact that you can drive from Lisbon, Portugal, to Tallinn, Estonia, without once showing anyone your passport should be considered a major political achievement. As historian Charles King writes, the EU has introduced something genuinely new to Europe--a political identity based on a set of values rather than old-fashioned ethnic nationalism. That being said, it's also always been a hard project to root for in its actual form: endlessly bureaucratic, unaccountable, and arrogant. As columnist Christopher Hitchens once mockingly pointed out, it's a body whose constitution begins not with something along the lines of ""we the people"" but with ""His Majesty, the King of the Belgians."" European integration is a project that has often been motivated less by optimism about the United States of Europe than by fear that if it ever stopped, the continent would return to the bad old days. It has always been, as historian Tony Judt described it, ""the insecure child of anxiety."" Now, it seems, anxiety isn't enough to keep the project on course. The first major turning point was the euro crisis, which exposed one of the union's signature projects--the common currency--as an ill-advised, or at least poorly implemented, blunder. The harsh, growth-strangling austerity programs the German-dominated leadership in Brussels then imposed on struggling member states deepened the continent's economic and political divides. Next came the refugee crisis, which has caused many to rethink the wisdom of open borders and, again thanks largely to Germany's policies, deepened the EU's East-West divide. The German question is, as always, pretty central here. The EU may have helped keep the peace since World War II, but Germany's economic dominance allowed British tabloids to portray the Brexit vote as a restaging of the Battle of Britain. The worst sign for the EU's future may actually be that it is losing popularity in the new member states that joined with such enthusiasm a few years ago. The Czech Republic has the lowest support for the EU in Europe, including the U.K. Poland and Hungary both have right-wing governments backsliding on democracy and proudly touting their willingness to defy Brussels. Thursday's result shouldn't have been shocking to anyone who watched Greece vote down its EU bailout deal last year, or majorities in France, the Netherlands, and Ireland reject successive EU constitution drafts, or Denmark and Sweden--the only country where euro adoption was put to a referendum, both reject it. The fact that the EU project is rejected almost every time it is put to a public vote should indicate that the union needs to do a better job of making a proactive case for itself. Instead, integration seems to continue apace and the response to these public votes has been to avoid holding them whenever possible. In the debate leading up to last night's vote, the ""Leave"" side argued for national sovereignty, political independence, and control of borders. The ""Remain"" side, by contrast, generally seemed to base its case on costs: Brexit would be expensive and the U.K. would lose out on access to markets. Not surprisingly, vigorous nationalism won out against lukewarm economic expediency. (Let's hope the Clinton campaign is taking notes.) In 1950, when Robert Schuman, French foreign minister and EU godfather, first proposed the European Coal and Steel Community, the original partnership that evolved into today's EU, he suggested the integration project would proceed ""through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity."" In other words, integrate first and ask questions later. But that's not good enough anymore. If the EU project has a future, its leaders and supporters need to find a way to make an affirmative case for it, not just warn voters of how expensive it would be to abandon it. German Chancellor Angela Merkel showed some signs of awareness on Friday, saying Europeans must not forget the foundation of European unity was the ""idea of peace."" But at this point, it's not clear that anyone is listening. Update, June 24, 2016: This article has been updated to add a citation to Charles King. Read more Slate coverage of the Brexit vote."	How the European Union Blew It

He'll build a wall on the Mexican border, block Muslim refugees, and slap tariffs on China. But Trump's latest threats against Muslim Americans, like his attacks on the ""Mexican"" judge in the Trump University fraud case, show that these assaults won't stop at the border. Trump is now targeting natural-born citizens of the United States, treating them as aliens based on religion or ethnicity. He's not building walls around America. He's building walls within it. When Trump went after Judge Gonzalo Curiel three weeks ago, calling him biased and underhanded because of his ""heritage,"" many Americans cried foul. It's one thing to campaign against illegal immigration or even legal immigration, they noted. It's quite another to challenge someone born in this country based on his ancestry. The massacre in Orlando on June 12, awful as it was, gave Trump an opportunity to change the subject and mend his ways. Instead, he continued--and broadened--his line of attack. He insinuated that Muslim Americans, like Mexican Americans, were disloyal. ""Since 9/11, hundreds of migrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism in the United States,"" Trump declared in a statement hours after the massacre. ""Hillary Clinton wants to dramatically increase admissions from the Middle East, bringing in many hundreds of thousands during a first term--and we will have no way to screen them, pay for them, or prevent the second generation from radicalizing."" ""Their children."" ""The second generation."" Trump wasn't just arguing, as he had in the past, that the refugees couldn't be vetted. He was claiming that even if they were vetted, they still had to be kept out of the country, because their offspring might someday become terrorists. This scenario would take place in the future, possibly involving children who were not yet born and influences from abroad that might reach these children without their parents' knowledge. Therefore, no migrant, regardless of vetting, was safe to admit.

29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/06/why_marco_rubio_is_running_for_senate.html	"Finally. Sen. Marco Rubio's public Hamlet routine about whether to run for re-election is over. No longer will we have to bother with reports about what his conscience is telling him and how events like the Orlando shooting helped him arrive at the conclusion that was wisest for his political future. He is running because that's his best available option for positioning himself ahead of the 2020 Republican presidential primaries, period, the end. There's nothing wrong with that; go get 'em, tiger. But one more day of this hammy aw-shucks routine and Rubio might've chewed up all that was left of the scenery at the Russell Senate Office Building. ""There were two paths before us,"" Rubio writes near the end of his letter explaining why he chose to run. ""There was one path that was more personally comfortable and probably smarter politically. But after much thought and prayer,""--this guy!--""together we chose to continue with public service; to continue down the path that provides the opportunity to make a positive difference at this critical and uncertain time for our nation."" Let's examine the path not taken, the one he had pledged to follow before he did all that thinking and praying. It's no lie it would have been more ""personally comfortable"" for him to have accepted a position as executive vice president of power-lunching for the financial entity of his choosing. The skyscraper corner office is there for whenever he wants it. But what about the Oval? He hasn't given up on that yet. Though he argues that not running for re-election would have been ""probably smarter politically""--itself a tell that his thinking still very much involves the White House--that self-effacing calculus doesn't check out. Rubio had three options for positioning himself for the White House. The first, as noted, was to enter the private sector. Aside from the torrents of cash, this could have plugged a hole in his resume: business experience. The only problem is: What business experience could a figure like Marco Rubio pick up in the two years he would have before he started running for president again? It's not enough time to actually start a private sector career, becoming a haberdasher or dry-goods merchant or whatever romanticized version of small business plays well in politics. He would either take the aforementioned sinecure at a hedge fund or join a law practice--most likely some combination of both. How would he use this? ""Just like you,"" he would say, standing atop a hay bale at the 2019 Iowa State Fair, ""I get up each morning, put on my pants, kiss my wife and kids goodbye and go to work in the private sector, using my networks of contacts to help devise strategies for inserting into appropriations bills riders that would dilute the federal government's ability to enforce capital requirements."" Then there's the non-Senate political option: running for governor of Florida in 2018. Rubio had denied any interest in this office but, heh, well. Were he to win that race, he'd thicken his resume with executive experience. The problem here is that presidential primary voters no longer care about gubernatorial experience. In the minefield of the contemporary Republican presidential primary, such experience and the difficult decisions that governing necessitates are more likely to serve as negatives. Being a governor also limits exposure to the national political media; he would risk falling off the map. And the timeline doesn't work, either: He can't launch a presidential campaign for 2020 the day after his inauguration in 2019. Barring another total crackup--a serious caveat--the 2020 Republican nominee will have an extremely good chance of denying Hillary Clinton a second term, so Rubio would have to wait until 2028 for his next shot. Are all of these downsides really worth the utility of being able to say, ""I cleaned up Tallahassee"" over and over on a debate stage? The recent literature suggests not. Rubio's best option for reaching the White House is to win re-election this fall and spend two more years posturing on the Senate floor before launching his second presidential campaign. A lengthier tenure will comfort the not-insignificant tranche of voters who thought his time hadn't yet come. He'll bury the Gang of Eight experience further down in his biography, and he'll know never again to make the same fatal mistake of trying to pass meaningful bipartisan legislation. He can dutifully vote ""no"" on as many bills as are necessary to procure his 100 percent rating from Heritage Action, and at the end of the day he can trudge down Capitol Hill to the Fox News studios and talk about how terrible Hillary Clinton is. He's also keenly aware that he's doing the party a favor by running for re-election. In one of its more honest moments, his explanatory letter notes how critical the Florida Senate race is to the balance of power in the Senate. When it comes time to run again, he'll have a bounty of chits to call in. ""In the end,"" he writes in his robotically saccharine style that America came to know earlier this year, ""this was a decision made not in Washington, but back home in West Miami over Father's Day weekend, with my wife and our four children."" A satisfying clincher to a well-executed public relations mission. Rubio made this pledge that he wouldn't run again a while ago and then came to realize that running again was probably his best option ahead of 2020. He had the patience to allow himself to be drafted. These last weeks have been impeccably choreographed, and the Father's Day decision is the audience-tested closing scene. The anecdote that gives us a rawer look at how Rubio really thinks, though, is the one, reported by Washingtonian, about how he asked Ted Cruz on Tuesday to ""blast out a statement urging Rubio to run for reelection, 'so it's not just Mitch [McConnell]' asking him to do so."" Cruz did end up endorsing Rubio on Wednesday, referring to him--with just the right amount of condescension--as ""a tremendous communicator."" Still, you've got to wonder whose anonymous aides leaked that embarrassing request from Rubio. The 2020 race between Cruz and Rubio is on, and both of them recognize that staying in the Senate is the best way to kill time and stay in the picture until then. Rubio just had a more complicated route to get there. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Why Is Marco Rubio Running for Senate? It's About 2020, of Course.
