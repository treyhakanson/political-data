The meeting near the Chesapeake Bay was full of realism about the party's slim chances to make gains in the 2014 elections. For some, in both the House and Senate, just keeping their jobs is a dicey proposition, which is why in selected races Democrats are distancing themselves from the president's health care plan. A Democratic super PAC is even running ads praising Democrats for criticizing the White House's botched rollout of the health exchanges. They get extra points for working to restore coverage to those whom the president had promised would be able to keep their plans and couldn't. It's no surprise that Democrats are on the defensive, but usually when they get together, someone makes the case for why people will like the law as soon as they understand it. A Democratic elected official told me as much this week. But Democrats have been making this case for four years--ever since the law was passed--and it hasn't moved public opinion much. Based on the president's remarks to his fellow party members, it appears he isn't holding out for any miracles. The president spoke about the upward tick in the enrollment numbers, the number of people who were now on Medicaid, and the fact that there would be fewer uninsured Americans as a result of the law. It followed the familiar pattern from countless other speeches in which he touts whatever the latest good news is for his hard-fought law. But then he did not make the expected pivot of assuring everyone that the more people knew about the Affordable Care Act, the more they would embrace it. Instead, he said: ""I just want to say thank you for all of you hanging in there tough on an issue that I think 10 years from now, five years from now, we're going to look back and say this was a monumental achievement that could not have happened had it not been for this caucus."" That is cold comfort for a member of Congress. Representatives are up for re-election in nine months; they can't wait nine years. The repeated recitation of the law's benefits hasn't changed the public's unfavorable views. That will only come over the years--more than a handful of years, the president suggests--if people's nightmares of higher premiums and losing their doctor don't come true. The president has always been wary about the political timeline for the law, though he used to be considerably more bullish. In making his final pitch to Democrats on the eve of their vote, he called out the courage of Reps. John Boccieri and Betsy Markey, who were in tough districts but standing up for the law. The president suggested the praise they were getting portended a possible political upside for the vote. When Ted Deutch won the first congressional election after the health reform law passed, in April 2010, the president had a mini-gloat. ""Now look, I mean, let's not get too excited, it's a Democratic district. But to listen to the Republicans, they were warning over and over again [the Deutch race] would be a referendum on health care. ... Well, maybe it was."" Deutch, who represents the most Democratic-leaning district of the three (by a long shot), is still in office. Boccieri and Markey were defeated in the 2010 elections after the law passed. Ahead of what appears to be another tough year, Obama wants Democrats to appreciate the moral benefit of their struggle, not just the political one. He is building on the pitch he made four years ago on the eve of the ACA vote, in what is still the most emotional pitch the president has ever made for the legislation. He quoted Lincoln: ""I am not bound to win, but I am bound to be true."" Four years later he is promising that they will indeed win. It just may not be in their political lifetime."

On June 13, 2013, Sen. Rand Paul finished a breakfast speech for social conservatives and headed across town to meet with the ACLU. Paul was going to act on information revealed by Edward Snowden by suing the National Security Agency. His plan was to ""challeng[e] the constitutionality"" of the court order that allowed the government to pull the records of Verizon phone calls. ""Americans are rightly concerned about having all of their phone records collected and monitored all of the time,"" said Paul, holding up his own, compromised smartphones for the clicking cameras. ""Today, we've gathered some of the nation's leading advocates of civil liberties to say: Enough's enough. We want our Constitution back."" Paul spoke first, followed by some likeminded Republican congressmen, the ACLU's Laura Murphy, FreedomWorks' Matt Kibbe, and finally Bruce Fein, who was introduced as a former associate deputy attorney general under Ronald Reagan. Fein had only had that specific job for a year. He'd worked with Paul for much, much longer, at least since his father, Ron Paul, started running for president in 2007. ""Sen. Rand Paul deserves a salute for his courage in standing up for the Constitution in the same manner of our Founding Fathers,"" said Fein in his assured voice that registers somewhere between nasal and reedy. ""It's an uphill battle, because we've become so powerful--we have a psychology of empire, big government everywhere, because we have to go abroad in search of monsters to destroy."" Fein delivered a pocket history of the Fourth Amendment, from the reaction to the British ""writs of assistance"" to the words of John Adams and James Otis, and finally to remarks by William Pitt the Elder. ""The poorest man,"" quoted Fein, ""may in his cottage bid defiance to all the force of the Crown. It may be frail, its roof may shake, the wind may blow through it, the storms may enter, the rain may enter, but the King of England cannot enter! All his forces dare not cross the threshold of the ruined tenement."" Close quote. ""That was the spirit of the Fourth Amendment!"" Reporters sat dazed as Paul took back the microphone. ""Well,"" said the senator, ""if we had our glasses, I'd say we raise a toast now to Pitt the Elder!"" Eight months later Paul filed the lawsuit on behalf of all those people who signed up via his RANDPAC. He filed it in person, at the U.S. District Court, before walking between a vinyl FreedomWorks backdrop and several dozen reporters grimacing in the cold. Lead attorney Ken Cuccinelli was there to answer questions. Bruce Fein wasn't. He wasn't on the case anymore. Hours later Paul and Cuccinelli were being accused of ""plagiarism."" The story of how Bruce Fein stopped being the de facto solicitor of the libertarian movement is a bit of a sideshow. Paul's lawsuit was an international story; Fein's absence, which blew up into a fight about whether the lawsuit was stolen intellectual property, was a he-said-she-said that played out across a few offices in Washington. On Wednesday, Fein's ex-wife Mattie was answering emails and media calls on his behalf. On Thursday she left this role after what she called ""a post-marital fight."" It's the latest and strangest example of Paul's challenge: managing the Republicans who want to share his brand without alienating the people who made his (and his father's) movement. Fein was definitely one of the founding partners, with decades of experience arguing that unpopular or unfair-seeming decisions were deeply rooted in the Constitution. In the Reagan years, Fein defended a regulation that allowed employers to discriminate against people with AIDS. It was ""akin to discrimination against persons who are left-handed or red-haired; it may be irrational, but Congress has not yet made it illegal."" In the early Bush years, Fein argued that Saddam Hussein should be killed without a trial, even if that violated the law. ""All laws are matters of degree,"" he wrote, ""even the rule of law. James Madison lectured in Federalist 51: 'Justice is the end of government. It is the end of civil society.' "" In the years between, he lobbied for the government of Sudan. Fein found a higher calling in 2007, when he started focusing, almost exclusively, on the outrages of the Bush administration. In columns for Slate, he argued for the impeachment of Dick Cheney and at least an impeachment inquiry for George W. Bush, because of his ""apparently criminal spying."" Suddenly, Democrats were inviting Fein--an old hand from the Reagan administration!--to take Bush apart in their oversight hearings. Suddenly, and more importantly, he entered the orbit of the Pauls. Fein gave a 25-minute speech decrying the ""utopian"" foreign policy of Bush at Paul's ""Rally for the Republic,"" a daylong celebration of his 2008 primary campaign, held in Minneapolis while Republicans met in St. Paul. Fein became a fixture at paleoconservative events--the smartest guy in the room, the one who had a quote from John Adams for any occasion. When Ron Paul announced his final presidential bid, Fein quickly endorsed him. When Sen. Rand Paul was criticizing the use of force in Libya, Fein was drafting articles of impeachment. ""If that level of oppression justifies war unilaterally,"" he told Alex Jones, ""we've got about 80 countries standing right behind Libya."" By the time Fein joined Sen. Paul for the NSA announcement, 2013 was becoming his milestone year. Lon Snowden, the father of the whistleblower, called Sen. Paul's office to talk about the growing circus. Snowden was encouraged to work with Fein. The attorney was suddenly, expertly shepherding his clients through the green rooms of This Week and Anderson Cooper 360. It didn't last. Fein represented Lon Snowden, but many press requests were routed through Mattie Fein. She insisted that Edward Snowden's allies, chiefly Glenn Greenwald, were exploiting him. The younger Snowden encouraged his father to dump the Feins, while issuing a statement to make clear that ""neither my father, his lawyer Bruce Fein, nor his wife Mattie Fein represent me in any way."" One month later, in late September, Lon Snowden terminated his relationship with his attorney. Fein didn't take it well, but he didn't blame his ex-wife. ""The belated unity of my former client, Ben Wizner, and Glen [sic ]Greenwald seems a desperate effort to bolster their relevance to Ed Snowden,"" Fein told reporter Michael Calderone. ""I regularly remind myself that Socrates struck the mightiest blow for freedom of inquiry in the history of mankind [by] taking the hemlock in Athens according to its laws, not fleeing elsewhere."" And Fein had a client who wasn't fleeing. He had Rand Paul. In the winter of 2013, Fein worked with other attorneys to craft Paul's lawsuit against the NSA. According to Mattie Fein, who provided an invoice, her ex-husband worked for 201.99 hours on the NSA brief. He charged only two-thirds of his normal $700-per-hour rate for work like reviewing the 1978 FISA amendments (six hours), meeting with NSA expert James Bamford (10 hours), and reviewing committee hearings. The bill added up to nearly $47,000. By Jan. 15, as first reported by Dana Milbank, Fein had produced a draft that ended up looking like the suit filed by Paul and Cuccinelli. It had been two weeks since Cuccinelli was announced as the attorney on the finished suit. Mattie Fein insists that her husband was dumbstruck. ""He wasn't even told that they were filing it on Wednesday."" Bruce Fein stayed silent. Mattie Fein did not. On Wednesday she carried out guerilla warfare against Cuccinelli, supplying reporters with her evidence that Cuccinelli--not even licensed to practice in D.C.--was peddling someone else's lawsuit, and suggesting questions that could stump him. The Paul-Cuccinelli-FreedomWorks press conference ended before noon, but by 2 p.m. Cuccinelli was emailing Bruce Fein to ask what had happened. ""Rather pointed questions from media folks have started to arise specifically about you,"" Cuccinelli wrote. ""Has Mattie perhaps had conversations with her contacts that have inspired such questions[?]"" Mattie intercepted the email and told Cuccinelli to speak to her directly. ""What is your explanation for not being able to answer the numerous FISA suits?"" she wrote. ""LOL I planted that because I know you are dumb as a box of rocks."" Paul had planned to hold a conference call about the lawsuit. It was canceled. Early on Wednesday evening, Milbank ran with the story that Paul had been accused of plagiarizing his lawsuit and had never paid Bruce Fein. ""Untrue,"" said Doug Stafford, executive director of RANDPAC, when asked about the story. ""Bruce was one of several attorneys. And he was paid."" On Thursday morning Stafford forwarded reporters an email from Bruce Fein himself. ""Mattie Lolavar was not speaking for me,"" wrote the attorney, pointedly using his ex-wife's maiden name. ""Her quotes were her own and did not represent my views. I was working on a legal team, and have been paid for my work."" If Bruce Fein is lucky, the decision to cut ties with Mattie will end the story. It just comes a little late. The Snowden case was a highlight, maybe the highlight, of his career, and the alliance with the Pauls won him a loyal following and a large audience. He could patch up those relationships. His friends certainly want him to. But as Rand Paul's national profile rises, some people can't rise with it."

2	2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/02/debt_limit_brinkmanship_is_dead_the_republican_strategy_of_crisis_budgeting.html	"Washington had returned to normal; reporters had surrounded Sen. Lindsey Graham to seek his wisdom. It had been only two hours since the House Republicans announced that they wouldn't demand any concessions in exchange for raising the debt limit. They would pass a ""clean"" bill, on the expectation that nearly every House Democrat would bail them out and support it. Graham, one of the Senate's Tesla coils of compromise, was explaining how the House Republicans blew it. ""If I was in the House, I'd put something in the debt ceiling bill that made sense to the average American,"" said the South Carolina senator. Those words, debt ceiling, sucked in yet more eavesdropping budget and finance reporters, who pointed the business ends of their recorders at Graham. ""Maybe there'd be a stimulus package where you repatriate corporate earnings to put in infrastructure projects that all of us would like to see happen. There are creative things you can do to grow the economy and decrease debt."" Here was Congress, giving up on the three-year battle to attach spending cuts to the debt limit. Here was Graham, explaining why it didn't have to be this way. It was the return of the golden age, pre-2011, low-stakes politics of the debt ceiling. The minority party votes ""no,"" the majority grudgingly raises the thing, and no one facilitates a crisis. The debt limit was restored to its natural and accidental place, as a vehicle for trolling. In its forgettable, shrugging way, this was history. Two months ago, the Ryan-Murray budget agreement had ended the four-year quest for a ""grand bargain"" by funding the government above the levels set in 2011 and not cutting entitlements. The Republicans' Tuesday collapse marked the end, for now, of the debt limit brinkmanship that House Speaker John Boehner never wanted in the first place. Really, he didn't--though he saw it coming. At the end of 2010, as it became clear that Republicans would run the House of Representatives, people started to wonder whether the new members would agree to raise the debt limit. Boehner, in a December 2010 interview with The New Yorker, acknowledged that they'd have to. ""For people who've never been in politics it's going to be one of those growing moments,"" he said. ""It's going to be difficult, I'm certainly well aware of that. But we'll have to find a way to help educate members and help people understand the serious problem that would exist if we didn't do it."" Thus began the Tea Party Era (2010-2011) of the debt limit crisis. Boehner had been presumptuous, and his new troops started correcting him. ""I think until proven otherwise we're looking for $300 billion in cuts if that's possible,"" said South Carolina Rep. Tim Scott, co-president of the freshman class, after the ""adult moment"" interview ran. ""Right now all the talk about the issue seems to be that it's a foregone conclusion that you cannot do that. I'd like to let the proof be in the pudding."" For the next seven months, the Refuseniks effectively ran the House. More than enough Republicans pledged to not raise the debt limit under any circumstances. Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey proposed legislation that would have promised ""to pay with legal tender the principal and interest on debt,"" and not any other government obligations, in case the ceiling was breached. Boehner and his team dispatched experts to explain why default would be unthinkable; his membership simply didn't believe it. When former undersecretary of the treasury Jay Powell showed Republicans a PowerPoint presentation on the crisis, conservatives like Georgia Rep. Phil Gingrey read him emails from banker friends who didn't buy it. So Boehner learned the lingo. ""I think this is the moment and this is the opportunity for us as Americans to tackle our long-term fiscal issue,"" he said as the crisis loomed. To shame Democrats, he brought up a ""clean"" bill to raise the debt limit by $2.4 trillion. It failed on a 97-318 vote. Meanwhile, House conservatives endorsed a plan--Cut, Cap, and Balance--that would raise the limit only when paired with wish-list conservative reforms. The pledge was rolled out at a special rally in the Senate that featured Republicans joined by scores of Washington-based conservative groups--the Club for Growth, the Institute for Liberty--and Tea Party organizations from the national Tea Party Express to the homey Kitchen Table Patriots. It would be adopted by most of the 2012 GOP candidates for president. Since then, the pledge has vanished from the Internet. The movement activists who'd pushed for it sound, today, completely fatalistic and unsurprised that the debt limit would be raised without a real fight. ""When Republicans were divided on that issue, it was basically a free pass for Democrats,"" said Tea Party Express strategist Sal Russo. ""Nobody ever wants to default. That's not a constructive way to talk about things, and we didn't make a very good education effort to explain otherwise."" They didn't, which meant that the eventual Budget Control Act that ended the crisis substituted the long-term cuts for ""sequestration,"" automatic cuts that could be replaced by a ""supercommittee"" of ... honestly, it's just too pathetic to think about it again. Suffice to say that the deal began the Empty Promise Era (2011-2014) of the debt limit crisis, a period of Republicans (mostly Boehner) saying that, of course, after the 2012 election the debt limit would be restored as leverage for reforms. It's difficult to count how many times this was said. Sometimes, Boehner promised a ""whale of a fight"" when the debt limit came up. Sometimes he invoked the ""Boehner rule,"" and said any debt limit increase, naturally, would be paired with spending cuts equal to the new, borrowed money. (This became a ""rule"" despite never actually happening.) In February 2011, Boehner pushed through a temporary delay of the debt limit on the promise that the GOP would have more leverage in the fall. When fall came, the ""Boehner rule"" was revised--now, any sort of reforms, no matter what the cost, would be good enough for a debt limit increase. None of this ever worked, and Republicans argue about the reasons why. One theory: The October 2013 government shutdown scared Republicans straight and convinced them that brinkmanship wasn't worth it unless they had a clear plan for victory. ""It did change the environment when the American people rejected the shutdown,"" Arizona Sen. John McCain said on Tuesday. ""It was a disaster. People can say that it wasn't, but it was. Don't ask me. Look at the poll numbers."" Another theory is that the stakes for Republicans, if they voted to raise the debt limit, were never as high as they thought. Only six House Republicans lost primaries in 2012. All but three of them--Florida Rep. Cliff Stearns, Oklahoma Rep. John Sullivan, and Ohio Rep. Jean Schmidt--were victims of redistricted maps that forced them into primaries against their colleagues. After 2012, ensconced in their safe seats, few Republicans feared being primaried for a debt limit vote. There's an alternative theory, one that Republicans never bring up. The deficit, the driver of the debt limit crisis, has shrunk steadily since 2011. A week before Tuesday's debt limit vote, in the CBO report that Republicans were largely using to attack the health care law, the deficit was projected to shrink to $514 billion, or half of what it had been when the Tea Party won the 2010 midterms. This has brought us back to the norm--the Era of Concern Trolling (1917-2010, 2014-present). Republicans aren't happy about this and rejected the idea that this week's surrender meant that no big policies could ever be leveraged in by a debt limit vote. Ohio Sen. Rob Portman and Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake argued that crises, and only crises, forced action on spending. But there'll be no crisis this year. ""If the position of the Democratic Party is that we're going to borrow money forever without addressing why we're in debt, I hope that becomes an issue in 2014,"" said Graham. ""Politically, they're misjudging where the American people are."" He headed off to the GOP's weekly luncheon, saying he'd vote against the ""clean"" debt limit bill. A few hours later, it passed the House."	The GOP's Debt-Limit Brinkmanship Is Officially Dead	['Portman', 'McCain', 'Flake', 'Toomey']	[]

4	4	http://www.slate.com/articles/life/culturebox/2014/02/bars_are_too_loud_and_caf_s_are_too_quiet_it_s_ruining_america.html	"On Dec. 16, 1773, a group of young men dressed as American Indians dumped three boatloads of tea into Boston harbor. It was the most brazen act of a long campaign of political disobedience planned by the Sons of Liberty from the safety of the Green Dragon and Salutation taverns in the city's North End. Today, you can still find the Green Dragon in the North End, a spiritual successor at the site of the original colonial tavern. But this Green Dragon is filled with throbbing music, making it a headache to plan and coordinate so much as a one-night stand (or so I've been told). Sixteen years after the Tea Party, on the night of July 12, 1789, journalist Camille Desmoulins stood on a table at the Cafe de Foy and called on his fellow Parisians to smash the monarchy before it smashed them. The ensuing riot climaxed two days later with the storming of the Bastille. In the U.S. in 2014, you'll find no shortage of urban cafes, but jump up on a table and you'll break little more than the silence--and perhaps an unlucky Macbook Air. Then management will invite you to leave. A noise gap has developed in American public life, and it's a problem. The bars--at least those frequented by people under 40, who historically drive bottom-up political movements--have gotten louder. How loud? In 2012, the New York Times found that bars in that city regularly reached decibel levels so dangerously high that they violated federal workplace safety standards. All that noise makes it hard to conduct a meaningful conversation, which is actually the idea. Bars have gotten louder at least in part in response to research showing that louder music encourages patrons to talk less and drink more. By rendering conversation obsolete, the loud atmosphere also nudges people towards imbibing past the point where intelligent conversation is possible. It's not easy to find a large, crowded bar in an American city where conversation isn't drowned out by music or a sports telecast. In fact, the Saloon, On U St. in Washington, D.C., has made its name by refusing to play loud music and forcing patrons to stay in their seats, making conversation possible. The cafes, meanwhile, have gotten quieter. For centuries, coffee was used as a conversation stimulant. But in the present-day U.S., it functions primarily as productivity booster. Coffee long ago penetrated the workplace, and now cafes themselves have become workplaces--not just for eccentric writers and artists, but for knowledge workers of all stripes, who are often plugged into headphones that are plugged into laptops. In 2011, a Gizmodo writer found it rude that people were talking near him at a cafe and tweeted, ""Etiquette question: Now that coffee shops are basically office spaces, do you have to be quiet when you're in them?"" At the Bean in Manhattan's East Village, as in several other other New York coffee houses, management has instituted a laptop-free zone. A few tables tucked in a corner of the shop, the Bean's computer-free zone may as well be a memorial to the late, great cafe atmosphere. The shift in both scenes amounts to more than just a loss for conversationalists. For centuries, bars and cafes around the world have fostered dissent and bottom-up political action. Cafes, especially, have bedeviled the authorities as long as they've existed. In 1511, worried about loose political talk stimulated by coffee, the governor of Mecca ordered all of the city's cafes to shut their doors. In 1675, Charles II of England condemned coffee houses as sites where ""False, Malitious and Scandalous Reports are devised and spread abroad, to the Defamation of His Majestie's Government, and to the Disturbance of the Peace and Quiet of the Realm."" He ordered all of them disbanded by January. Neither ban proved enforceable. In the history of the United States, the bars have played host to much of the action. Both the international labor and LGBTQ movements can trace their roots to American watering holes. The U.S. labor movement first took hold in the beer halls of industrial cities. The 1886 Haymarket Rally, which ended with 11 fatalities, was planned at Greif's Hall in Chicago, a hotbed of labor agitation, by a group of anarchists and activists. Prosecutors went on to characterize the meeting at Greif's as the ""Monday Night Conspiracy,"" and its participants were convicted as accessories to the murder of the police officers killed at the rally. The events inspired the communist and labor movements' observation of May Day. The LGBTQ rights movement began in earnest in the summer of 1969 with a rebellion against a police shakedown at the Stonewall Inn, a mob-run gay dive bar in Greenwich Village. Though the Stonewall riots were spontaneous, much of the organized movement that sprang from them was planned at gay bars from California to England. This isn't coincidence--a variety of factors have made bars and cafes the spaces where potent political change begins. Alcohol loosens inhibitions and caffeine stimulates conversation. The spaces offer a meeting place for people who don't have access to private clubs, boardrooms, and the halls of power--people, in other words, who are less invested in the status quo. Crucially, these are also semi-public spaces that can deliver a measure of privacy, a place where it's easy to congregate yet hard for authorities to monitor. But that sweet spot can only be achieved at a certain level of din: A bar or cafe needs to be quiet enough that you can engage in conversation but loud enough to create both the perception and the reality that you won't be too easily overheard by the wrong people. (Not that the authorities won't try. Louis XV's spies haunted the cafes of 18th-century Paris. The NYPD's controversial 21st-century infiltration of Muslim neighborhoods in New York City and beyond sent plainclothes officers to spy in cafes where they eavesdropped on conversations about politics, cricket, and kebab.) It's this din, created by a large number of people closely congregated and engaging in regular conversation, which has been increasingly hard to find in our coffee houses and beer halls. In part, the noise gap has developed because the Internet has become our new gathering space. A lot of those people ignoring their neighbors at cafes are on their computers, and some of them are surely using those machines to engage with politics. (The FBI has asked Internet cafe owners to report suspicious customers, defined in part as people who ""always pay cash"" and ""are overly concerned about privacy,"" as potential terrorists.) But the Web cannot play the same role as bars and cafes. It can't match the intimacy of those physical spaces or their potential for spontaneous mass gatherings. For all the hype about social media's role in the Arab Spring, cafes still played a role, and an important one. Al Jazeera presenter Hassan Ibrahim has said of Egyptian protestors, ""Electronic media, and the Internet played a vital role, but actually, they met in coffee shops. All political movements in Egypt started in coffee shops."" It's also much easier for governments to tightly monitor online expression, as revelations of the NSA's extensive Internet penetration have underscored. In 2012, the government compelled Twitter to turn over thousands of tweets from an Occupy Wall Street protestor charged with disorderly conduct. The tweets bolstered the government's case, and the protestor pleaded guilty lest they become public at trial and incriminate other Occupiers.  The Internet is not always an environment conducive to civil disobedience. Perhaps this is why we haven't seen a bottom-up political movement agitating to break our country's political paralysis. Much has been made of Washington lawmakers' changed social habits. Their short workweeks and the permanent campaign push them back to their districts on weekends. They no longer mix at Georgetown townhouses or over bourbon-fueled poker games, and so, the theory goes, across-the-aisle deal-making doesn't happen. But the same social insulation affects average citizens as well. The rest of us sip coffee and beer right next to our neighbors without the opportunity to take each other's confidences, shout about politics, or engage in acts of spontaneous persuasion. In the wake of a financial crisis and in the face of a sclerotic federal government, we might have expected a political upheaval in recent years in the U.S. Instead, we got the Tea Party and Occupy. Today's Tea Party emerged in part from the Koch Brothers' boardrooms, not a tavern, and it's no wonder that the putative grassroots movement has had the primary effect of contributing to more gridlock, installing obstructionist legislators, and discouraging moderates from participating in deal-making. Occupy managed to insert income inequality into the national dialogue, but the carried interest loophole still enriches hedge fund managers while Congress cuts food stamps for the poor. After the movement was pushed from the open-air spaces it occupied, it lacked another space in which to build on what momentum it had. We're left with a political system in which our Congress is near-universally reviled, and yet its incumbents can generally expect to remain in power. Sure, not everything that comes out of the bars and cafes is to the good. The Beer Hall Putsch, in which the Nazis tried and failed to seize control of Munich, was Hitler's stepping-stone to power. Desmoulins, after inciting the storming of the Bastille, eventually succumbed to the guillotine in Robespierre's reign of terror. But the guys who planned the Boston Tea Party over rum punch decided that allowing for the possibility of periodic upheaval was an important part of their democratic experiment. The current upheaval in the Middle East, it's worth noting, is often playing out in cafes. The first cafes in the world sprang up in the region some time between the mid-15th and early 16th centuries, and they continue to serve an important political function. As Billie Jeanne Brownlee, a scholar of Middle East politics, wrote last year, ""Unlike in the West, the Internet has not turned people into antisocial creatures; quite the opposite, it has turned these cafes into places where information found on the web is shared face-to-face between friends."" The New York Times found ""the spirit of the Arab Spring"" alive and well last year in a buzzing cafe in Tunis. Perhaps it's no coincidence that the owner of Washington's most conversation-friendly bar, Saloon proprietor Kamal Jahanbein, was born in Iran. The Washington Post has dubbed the establishment ""a true chat room."" Maybe all this country needs to deliver the periodic rebellion the founders counted on is a few more good proprietors willing to get Americans talking, confiding, and subverting again. I'd drink to that."	Bars Are Too Loud and Cafes Are Too Quiet. It's Ruining American Democracy.	['Hassan']	['gay']

(Posed mainly by people not from North Carolina.) And: ""Why doesn't anyone care what's happening here in North Carolina?"" (Posed largely by folks rallying in North Carolina.) The answer to the first question was laid out forcefully by Prof. Jedediah Purdy in the Huffington Post. As state governments limit reproductive rights, gerrymander voting districts, harm workers and the environment, and suppress the vote, we are all North Carolina now. The answer to the second question is that I don't really know why the major national media, with a few notable exceptions, keeps ignoring this story. So my son and I joined friends from Virginia and Georgia on a road trip to Raleigh, N.C., on Saturday, where tens of thousands of protesters gathered, largely undetected by cable news, to protest the raft of vicious new laws passed by the North Carolina state legislature in the past two years. Organizers hoped that 20,000 protesters would assemble. The NAACP estimates that between 80,000-100,000 protesters turned out. Either way, it should have been news. If you haven't heard of ""Moral Mondays"" or North Carolina NAACP President Rev. William Barber II or the amazing HKonJ coalition, which stands for Historic Thousands on Jones Street, well, check it out: For the past eight years, a diverse group of North Carolinians under the HKonJ umbrella have been protesting state government policies at monthly rallies. Then last spring Moral Mondays became a thing. When the GOP won both the state House and Senate and then elected Republican Pat McCrory as governor in 2012, the party gained complete control of state government for the first time in more than 100 years. GOP-controlled redistricting and a truly nasty voter suppression bill attempt to ensure that this remains the permanent state of affairs in North Carolina. The legislature promptly raised taxes on the bottom 80 percent, eliminated the earned-income tax credit for 900,000 people, slashed education spending, passed radical gun legislation, declined the Medicaid expansion (leaving 500,000 of its poorest citizens without health insurance), and passed a draconian abortion bill that was tacked onto a motorcycle safety law. The state, in short, turned on its own workers, its own minorities, its own teachers, its own doctors, its poor, its women, and its prisoners, with what has looked like unbridled glee. As Deborah Gerhardt explained recently in Slate, the effect of the school cuts on the state's teachers has been nothing short of devastating. The steadily expanding Moral Mondays protests--held since April at the state legislature--led to the arrests of almost 1,000 peaceful citizens protesting at the rotunda. And Saturday's demonstration was, according to Ari Berman, ""the largest civil rights rally in the South since tens of thousands of voting rights activists marched from Selma to Montgomery in support of the Voting Rights Act."" As the Moral Mondays movement has grown, it has spread to other states, with protesters in Tennessee and Georgia recently arrested at their own Moral Mondays demonstrations in response to state government outrages. South Carolina has now created ""Truthful Tuesday."" I think it's probably high time Virginia progressives adopted something along the lines of a ""Thoughtful Thursday."" Based on Saturday's turnout in Raleigh, this is not a movement that is going to fade away. And based on the growth of out-of-state participation, it's no longer clear that what happens in North Carolina only matters to North Carolinians. One of the great ironies of the Moral Mondays movement is that although Republican politicians like to deride the protesters as out-of-state meddlers, they are passing mass-produced American Legislative Exchange Council-sponsored laws that are crafted at the national level by huge interest groups promoting national big-business interests. Hardly a grassroots effort. It turns out that social justice, like corporate greed, knows no geographic boundaries. So what was Saturday's protest like? Lovely. Busloads of marchers from across the country joined tens of thousands of state protesters on a chilly gray morning. They started at Shaw University, where 54 years ago the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee was founded and radically altered both politics and protest in the South. They ended up in the plaza and surrounding streets across from the state Capitol. No arrests were planned at this protest, and none occurred. Parents marched with their babies, LGBT activists stood next to doctors in lab coats, and immigration reformers and students of all ages chanted and sang. The reproductive rights activists wore pink. Organized labor supporters wore red. Teachers, veterans, and nurses stood shoulder to shoulder with rabbis, imams, Unitarians, and Baptist preachers. Sound corny to you? As someone who fully supported the goals of the Occupy movement of 2011 but never felt perfectly comfortable with the fact or rhetoric of an occupation, this form of protest--nonviolent, respectful, even expressly faith-based and across multiple coalitions--felt right. As Barber put it: ""Justice is what love looks like in public."" One of the first speakers of the morning opened with a booming, Southern, ""Shabbat Shalom, y'all."" An imam spoke eloquently of civil rights. An astute 11-year-old friend observed that when so many religious leaders can agree so much about moral truths, ""The speeches can be much shorter."" And when Barber spoke, he toggled almost imperceptibly between quoting the Constitution and the Bible. ""Kicking hardworking people when they are down is not just bad policy. It is against the common good,"" he preached, pleading, ""Lord, Lord, plant our minds on higher ground."" Progressives are not used to so much religion in their politics. I met someone who planned to avoid Saturday's protest because of the God talk, and it's clear that for many liberals, it's easier to speak openly about one's relationship with a sexual partner than a relationship with God or spirituality. But there are a lot of liberals who live on the seam between faith and politics. And one of the core messages of Moral Mondays is that ceding all talk of faith and morality to the political right in this country has been disastrous for the left. Or as Barber put it when he spoke, those who dismiss these protesters as ""violent, and losers, and leftists, and socialists"" fail to understand that the great prophets of the Bible and the founders of American constitutional democracy were ""violent, and losers, and leftists, and socialists,"" too. As discomfiting as it may be to hear the Bible quoted alongside the Federalist Papers, the truth remains that for most people of most faiths, kicking the poorest and most vulnerable citizens when they are down is sinful. Stealing food and medical care from the weakest Americans is ethically corrupt. And the decadeslong political wisdom that only Republicans get to define sin and morality is not just tactically wrong for Democrats. It's also just wrong. This is a lesson progressives are slowly learning from nuns and the new pope. When we talk of cutting food stamps or gutting education for our poorest citizens, we shouldn't just call it greed. We should call it what it is: a sin. The other exciting component of Moral Mondays is that its leadership has worked to forge ""fusion"" politics that strive to undo the atomized nature of liberal activism, where climate change issues have no bearing on reproductive rights and reinstating voting rights must come at the expense of immigration reform. Barber and the Moral Mondays protests have broken down single-issue-based divisions on the left by focusing each Monday protest on one issue while enabling protesters to understand that they are all ultimately connected. Instead of fighting dozens of separate battles, Moral Mondays have made those battles everyone's battles. As a result, at Saturday's protest, teachers spoke of budget cuts and of women's health; doctors spoke of insuring the poor and of the right to vote. People who arrived angry about LGBT rights in the state left angry about organized labor. Working across constituencies means that injustice for any one group becomes injustice for all. So what does this all accomplish? The Moral Mondays' short-term demands are to reinstate the lost health care, LGBT rights, voting rights, reproductive rights, and rights of prisoners. But the real effort is to get out the vote, to organize and mobilize state voters to demand change. ""We are the voters, and there will be elections in 2014, and there will be elections in 2016,"" explained a Raleigh physician who was arrested protesting last year."" Don't forget, if the 2012 elections showed us anything, it's that attempts at vote suppression usually end badly for the GOP. On Saturday, the protest was long, the weather was chilly, and when Barber started to really preach at the end of his speech, my 8-year-old kid found it all too loud and too much. So we took him to a nearby science museum, where he handled stuffed squirrels for a few hours until he was cheerful again. As we were leaving the museum, he mused that it was a good day for combining history with science. I asked him what part of the day had involved history. ""The protest was history,"" he said, deploying the silent ""duhhh"" of a slightly older child. I thought about this for a minute and then told him it may indeed have been history--and that it will be his generation, not ours, that makes it so."

6	6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/02/the_new_conservative_assault_on_early_voting_more_republicans_fewer_voters.html	"It is easy to dismiss the latest conservative rants against early voting as just one more way for Republicans to try to gain advantage over Democrats at the polls. But something much more troubling may also be at work: Some opponents of early voting are promoting the view that a smaller (and skewed) electorate is better for democracy. In the past few weeks, a flurry of conservatives have attacked early voting, from Eugene Kontorovich and John McGinnis in Politico to George Will in the Washington Post to J. Christian Adams in the Washington Times.  The timing is no coincidence: The Presidential Commission on Election Administration, which President Obama created to look at issues with long lines and other election problems, recently issued its much-anticipated report. The report is full of many sound suggestions for improving our elections, and one of the key recommendations is to expand early voting, either in person, through absentee ballots, or both. There's good reason to follow the commission's recommendation: Early voting takes pressure off administering the vote on Election Day. It helps avert long lines and aids election administrators in working out kinks. Voters like early voting because it lets them pick a convenient time to vote, when there are not work or child-care conflicts. And yet, the commission's stance on early voting could have been derailed by politics. The commission was co-headed by Barack Obama's election lawyer, Bob Bauer, and Mitt Romney's election lawyer, Ben Ginsberg, and some observers thought that Ginsberg might take heat for endorsing early voting because in recent years it has benefited Democrats. That's why the Republican legislatures in Florida, North Carolina, and Ohio have cut back on early voting. To their credit, Ginsberg and other Republican commissioners saw the sound basis for expanding early voting and ignored the partisanship surrounding the issue. The conservative critique against early voting, meanwhile, goes deeper than the partisan concern about boosting Democratic turnout. George Will bemoans early voting as ""diffuse and inferior."" Adams says, ""Early voting means stubborn voters will make uninformed decisions prematurely. Voting even one week early produces less-informed voters and dumbs down the electorate."" Kontorovich and McGinnis complain: ""People will be able to vote when the mood strikes them--after seeing an inflammatory ad, for example. Voting then becomes an incoherent summing of how various individuals feel at a series of moments, not how the nation feels at a particular moment."" Despite their opposition to early voting, Kontorovich and McGinnis don't seem to have a problem with ""old fashioned absentee ballots."" That's nonsense. If one really believes that we need a set Election Day to all make a deliberative choice together, absentee balloting is even worse than early voting because it does not even happen in public with other voters and it raises a real risk of voter fraud--much more than in-person voting. (Will and Adams, for their part, generally don't like absentee voting.) All of these conservative commentators agree that everyone should vote on Election Day to promote ""deliberation"" or to prevent ""stubborn"" voters from making ""uninformed"" or emotional decisions ""prematurely."" In short, they argue that we cannot trust the people to decide for themselves when they have enough information to vote. The claim is empirically false. As Doug Chapin explains: ""This argument, which was popular a decade ago, is undercut by research by Paul Gronke and others showing that early voters are not only more partisan but less undecided, meaning that they have no interest in 'taking in the full back and forth of the campaign.' It also flies in the face of voters, well, voting with their feet by choosing to cast ballots outside of the traditional polling place."" But conservative critics of early voting runs don't just mistrust early voters; they mistrust voters in general. As I explained here, there is a fundamental divide between liberals and conservatives about what voting is for: Conservatives see voting as about choosing the ""best"" candidate or ""best"" policies (meaning limits on who can vote, when, and how might make the most sense), and liberals see it as about the allocation of power among political equals. Cutting back on early voting fits with the conservative idea of choosing the ""best"" candidate by restraining voters from making supposed rash decisions, rather than relying on them to make choices consistent with their interests. In a sense, the more barriers to voting, the better. Consider how Jonah Goldberg put it in a 2005 Los Angeles Times column: ""Voting should be harder, not easier--for everybody. ... If you are having an intelligent conversation with somebody, is it enriched if a mob of uninformed louts, never mind ex-cons and rapists, barges in? People who want to make voting easier are in effect saying that those who previously didn't care or know enough about the country to vote are exactly the kind of voters this country needs now."" It is probably no coincidence that the comments on Adams' piece on the Washington Times website go even further, by endorsing things like literacy tests or civics tests before voting. I wish the calls to cut back on early voting were merely partisan. But I fear not."	The New Conservative Assault on Early Voting: More Republicans, Fewer Voters	['Paul', 'Adams', 'Obama']	[]

It's a strange notion because the United States is more engaged with the world than at any time in recent memory. There are nuclear talks in Iran (after 34 years of no talking whatsoever), an internationally supervised dismantling of chemical weapons in Syria, half-serious nudges toward an Israeli-Palestinian peace (an improvement over unbridled neglect), and a delicate approach to the Asia-Pacific that embraces China as a partner while containing its expansionist impulses (though this combination could bear more attention). Who knows how these efforts will pan out, but they're hardly the signs of aloof disengagement. What many of these critics don't like about Obama--what they mistakenly, or misleadingly, call ""disinterest""--is his disinclination to go to war. And who can blame him? Two years after the last American soldier left Iraq, the place is ablaze in sectarian conflict, hundreds of civilians dying every week. Afghanistan awaits an uncertain fate as the troops head toward the exits there. Some blame Obama for these failures, too. If only he'd kept a few thousand troops in Iraq and made an open-ended commitment to Afghanistan, they claim, the insurgents would be cowed, the central governments would be stable, and the people would be prosperous and secure. To believe these claims requires a twisted view of the two wars and a deep misunderstanding of power in the modern world. First, the wars. It's maddening to have to repeat this fact over and over, but George W. Bush--not Barack Obama--negotiated the Status of Forces Agreement with Iraq, which required the withdrawal of all U.S. forces by the end of 2011. One clause allowed the deadline to be extended by the vote of both countries' parliaments, but the Iraqi parliament wasn't about to do any such thing. Obama dispatched emissaries, including one who'd also worked in the Bush White House, to see if some deal could be arranged. It couldn't. The re-eruption of sectarian violence has little to do with America's withdrawal and everything to do with the oppressive rule of Iraq's prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki. The whole point of the surge in U.S. troops and the switch to a counterinsurgency strategy, as led by Gen. David Petraeus, was to slash the violence, buy some time, and create a ""zone of security,"" so that Iraq's political factions could form a durable, inclusive government. The problem was, and is, that Maliki had no interest in inclusiveness. He had no interest in sharing power with Sunni politicians, or bringing Sunni militias into the national army, or dividing oil revenues and settling land disputes with the Kurds. He was interested only in solidifying power for himself and his Shiite allies (at home and across the border). It was inevitable that the Sunnis would revolt--and that foreign jihadists would rush in to help, and exploit, their cause. This is an armed struggle for power--with an all-too-familiar script. If we couldn't influence Maliki's actions on this score when we had 100,000 troops in his country, we couldn't have done so with 3,000 or 10,000. A similar tale plagues Afghanistan. In the 12 years we've been fighting there (today's new junior officers were in kindergarten when al-Qaida hijackers toppled the World Trade Center), the Afghan army has grown and improved; its special-ops forces are particularly good. But here too, the problem isn't military; it's political. Afghan President Hamid Karzai's government lacks legitimacy and isn't interested in reform. The Taliban have seeped into districts and provinces where his governors are either corrupt or ineffectual. Back in 2009, Adm. Mike Mullen, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified to Congress that he could throw in a million more troops, and they wouldn't have much effect if the central government remained corrupt. That equation hasn't changed. Which leads to the question of military intervention, broadly. Embedded in the portrait of Obama as a feckless world leader is an assumption that the United States--or any one nation--can solve a big problem by throwing troops at it. Bush threw 140,000 troops into Iraq, Obama threw an extra 64,000 into Afghanistan--and while each escalation yielded some tactical successes, neither of them settled the war's cause or gave us lasting leverage to sway the local leader, whose very life was saved only by the terrible sacrifices American troops and taxpayers suffered. No one country can shape the world the way it once did, because the world has grown less malleable. The turning point, in this regard, wasn't 9/11 but 11/9--Nov. 9, 1989, the date the Berlin Wall fell, followed soon after by the collapse of the Soviet Union and, with it, the Cold War. The Cold War was a time of dread, but it was also the dominant feature of global politics since the end of World War II. It set the alliances, rules, and measures of power that fostered and fed America's rise. With the system's implosion came a global diffusion of power. Take Egypt. In the mid-1970s, when President Anwar Sadat broke away from the Soviet orbit, he turned to the United States--and, as a consequence, had to change his country's policies on a number of issues, especially relations with Israel--because he had no choice; he needed protection from one superpower or the other. In today's multipolar (or, in some ways, nonpolar) world, Egypt's ruling generals can pursue their own interests as they see them, consorting with and dangling a number of countries. If our interests collide with theirs, no American president can do much to rein them in. And so it goes with Iraq and Afghanistan. Maliki has his own agenda. It doesn't align much with ours; it never did, a fact that some smart colonels and generals realized at the time. He sees our past alliance as one of convenience and has now moved on to other allies, including Iran--except, of course, when he needs arms and consulting advisers to stave off his old enemies, in which case he turns to us again, and we supply him with what we can. This is fine, when it's also in our interests to resupply him, but there should be no illusions; there's no point going back in deeper, even if the treaty allowed it, because, like the last time, we won't be able to settle the war on our terms. Obama seems to realize this. He too has an unsentimental outlook on the world. His views have been tempered by Iraq and scorched by Afghanistan. He's not shy about using military force, but insists, when possible, to grip it tightly. ""Escalation"" is a suspect term; ""uncontrolled escalation,"" is an unacceptable one. As evidence, see Libya, Syria, drone strikes, and Stuxnet. One can admire or criticize the actions he's taken, or not taken, in those crises or with those precision instruments. But they're all preferable to sending in 100,000 troops in pursuit of a mission that we have no power to accomplish, even with all those men and women in arms. And if going into such conflicts lightly, or not at all, is the emblem of disengagement, let him wear it proudly."

9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/02/thomas_steyer_michael_bloomberg_and_jonathan_soros_give_big_to_super_pacs.html	"The first generation of super PACs operated as shadow party committees, embodied in American Crossroads, the pro-Republican behemoth co-founded in 2010 by Karl Rove and Ed Gillespie. Next came candidate-specific super PACs, like those that aided President Obama and his GOP rival, Mitt Romney, in 2012. The latest iteration is the single-issue vanity super PAC--a group backed by a single, wealthy donor focusing on an issue of national importance, such as climate change or gun violence. Case in point: Thomas Steyer. An environmental activist and former hedge fund executive, Steyer invested more than $11.1 million into his two super PACs last year. That's more than any other individual, union, or company gave to super PACs in 2013, according to a Center for Public Integrity review of campaign finance records. Steyer's NextGen Climate Action Committee and CE Action Committee hammered home the message that politicians need to take action on global warming during the Virginia gubernatorial race and the special U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts. This stands in stark contrast to the 2012 election cycle, when Steyer did not donate a dime to super PACs. Steyer ""is committed to engaging in campaigns where climate is on the ballot,"" said Suzanne Henkels, the deputy press secretary for NextGen Climate Action, who added that the CE Action Committee ""is in the process of winding down its operations."" Super PACs became a household term following the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision in 2010. Unlike candidates, these political committees can accept unlimited donations from billionaires, corporations, and unions and use the money to pay for ads that support or oppose candidates. Republican groups, like American Crossroads, were quicker to welcome the new rules than Democrats. This election cycle, however, Democrats have embraced the big-money groups in a bid to retain control of the U.S. Senate. No. 2 on the list of 2013's super donors is a billionaire who was once a member of each party and is now an independent funding his own issue-driven super PAC. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg contributed $8.7 million to super PACs last year, mostly to his own Independence USA PAC, a group that favors stricter gun control laws. (Bloomberg gave about $6 million to the Independence USA PAC in 2013.) The outfit backed Democrat Terry McAuliffe in his winning 2013 bid to be Virginia's governor. It was also active in a U.S. House race in Illinois and the special U.S. Senate election in New Jersey. Bloomberg has said the super PAC is designed to support moderates who ""will help protect Americans from the scourge of gun violence, improve our schools and advance our freedoms,"" including gay couples' right to marry. He also contributed $2.5 million to the pro-Democratic Senate Majority PAC and $250,000 to Americans for Responsible Solutions, a pro-gun control super PAC founded by former Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona. Then there's Jonathan Soros, the son of financier George Soros. The younger Soros contributed more than $1 million last year to a hybrid super PAC he co-founded, known as Friends of Democracy. That was enough to rank Soros among the largest Democratic-leaning super PAC donors in 2013, although not quite enough to earn him a spot on the top 10 list. The elder Soros, for his part, contributed about half as much as his son last year, including $500,000 to the Democratic-aligned American Bridge 21st Century super PAC, $25,000 to the Ready for Hillary super PAC, and $5,000 to Friends of Democracy. Friends of Democracy is designed to be the anti-super PAC super PAC. It supports candidates who favor campaign finance reform and seeks to ""stop the power of money in politics."" As a hybrid super PAC, it can make direct donations to candidates from one fund that accepts only contributions of limited size and produce political ads from another fund that is unrestricted. Numerous labor unions peppered the list of the 10 largest super PAC donors in 2013, including the National Education Association (No. 4), the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners (No. 5), the AFL-CIO (No. 7), and THE AFSCME (No. 8). Also on the list: the Democratic Governors Association (No. 3), which largely used its super PAC to funnel money to McAuliffe's campaign in Virginia, and Texas trial lawyers Steve and Amber Mostyn, who mostly gave through their law firm (No. 10). In all, the top 10 super donors collectively gave more than $47 million, accounting for nearly one-third of the roughly $150 million raised by super PACs last year, according to the Center for Public Integrity's research. The biggest Republican super PAC donor in 2013 was Bob Perry, who contributed $3.1 million and whose death in April has left a void in GOP fundraising circles. That sum ranked him as No. 6 on the super donor list. The largest beneficiary of Perry's giving was a hybrid super PAC called Texans for a Conservative Majority, which received $2 million. That group has actively worked to help Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, fend off a conservative primary challenger. Many of the deep-pocketed GOP donors who ranked among the most generous givers during the 2012 election cycle have yet to open their checkbooks for super PACs during this election cycle. Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson did not contribute a cent to super PACs in 2013. Nor did his wife, Miriam Adelson. The couple contributed more than $90 million to such groups during the previous election cycle. Similarly quiet were GOP mega-donors Joe Ricketts, Robert Rowling, and William Koch, the lesser-known brother of billionaire industrialists David and Charles Koch. The more famous Koch brothers have typically used nonprofits, rather than super PACs, to weigh in on policy debates and elections. The only other Republican to break the list of the top 10 super PAC donors in 2013 was John Jordan, a California vintner who ranked 9th overall after contributing $1.7 million to a super PAC that backed underdog GOP Senate candidate Gabriel Gomez in the Massachusetts special election last June. His super PAC has since disbanded. Ben Wieder contributed to this report.

10	10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/02/philip_seymour_hoffman_s_political_documentary_the_party_s_over.html	"Philip Seymour Hoffman slumps in his chair, dressed for a sick day--baggy clothes, knit cap. He lolls his eyes at a TV set that's playing a series of depressing videos from the 2000 presidential campaign. George Bush yammers his talking points. Al Gore rises like Aphrodite, shirtless, out of a tossing sea. ""I decided to host this documentary because I felt ill-informed,"" says Hoffman. ""I've always had an aversion to politics. Can't say why."" This is the first real scene of The Party's Over, also known as Last Party 2000, maybe more easily explained as Hoffman's sole political documentary. For a few weeks that year, a 34-year old Hoffman teamed up with filmmakers Donovan Leitch and Rebecca Chaiklin and acted as a layman guide to America's last pre-war-on-terror election. The result was a curio that hasn't been discussed much by Hoffman's countless admirers and eulogists. He was probably the best actor of his generation, and there's no acting in this movie. The Party's Over was one of the only sequels Hoffman ever made. Eight years earlier, Leitch had produced a similarly experimental documentary, The Last Party, in which a manic Robert Downey Jr. sort of reported on the 1992 election. I say ""sort of"" because the most memorable parts of the movie are not his interviews (he asks Bill Clinton if ""anybody under 30"" will speak at the convention) but the many scenes in which Downey unleashes his inner ""goat boy"" and jumps around on all fours. ""The prerequisite for Downey was that he'd never participated in politics and never voted,"" remembers Leitch. (Chaiklin politely declined to talk about the movie.) ""It was the same for Philip. He'd never voted. Also, we had some friends in common, and we loved his work. It wasn't like he was a huge A-list actor, but we kind of liked his no-nonsense approach--kind of the antithesis of Robert Downey. Everything was so big with him. Phil played it much closer to the vest."" Much closer. Hoffman tended to sound wise, sad, and searching in the many interviews he gave about his acting. If he'd researched a role, he could explain the character's motivations and biases with the skill of an authorized biographer. But as a political correspondent he was earnest and occasionally overwhelmed. ""The first interview we did was with Harold Ford Jr., when he was a congressman,"" says Leitch. ""We hadn't prepped Phil, and during that interview he felt a little out of his depth. So we wrapped and he said, 'Hey, guys--next time, I want to get the brief before I go in.' From then on, we'd have a conversation about who we were about to talk to; we'd have a file. He was an incredibly smart guy, and he could figure things out for himself, but part of the process of making these films was that we wanted him to come into it on his own."" So the filmmakers hooked Hoffman up with thinkers and strategists on the right and left. ""Hoffman struck me as a guy with noble intent,"" remembers Mark McKinnon, then a strategist for the Bush campaign. ""He didn't know much about politics, but he seemed to genuinely want to discover what was at the root of the dysfunction and corruption we call American politics today. While it turned out to be pretty left-leaning, I had the sense that Hoffman was sincere in his approach, and sadly discovered himself knee deep in a cesspool of bipartisan bile."" The film lets us see Hoffman struggling to escape the cesspool. ""I'm nervous,"" he says before a hastily-scheduled interview with Jesse Jackson. ""I'm forgetting all my questions."" Hoffman eventually just lets Jackson roll, nudging him along to see how much contempt he has for the Republican rebranding effort that defined the 2000 convention in Philadelphia. The actor takes the same approach with everyone who comes on camera. They know more than him, fine--he's not going to nail them, but he's going to see how well they've thought through their dogmas. The more they had, whatever those dogmas were, the more engaged he got. After a night in a debate spin room, Hoffman wipes his brow with frustration at what John Kerry, Karl Rove, and the rest of the hacks have been telling him. Cut to an interview with Noam Chomsky about how meaningless the exercise had been. ""I remember the interview with Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon,"" says Leitch. ""They were backing Ralph Nader, and they'd been political animals for years. Talking to them, you could see Phil get pumped up. Even Ralph Nader's convention was inspiring to be at. Phil respected the fact that Nader wasn't going to fall on his sword to let the Democrats win the election. That's where Phil's heart was. He had an independent spirit."" He also happened to cover the most depressing election in a baby boomer's lifetime. Filming was supposed to wrap on Election Day. The election didn't end right then. The filmmakers hurried to Florida to cover the recount, and when he found time, Hoffman returned to Washington to gawk at the protests outside the Supreme Court. The cameras capture a series of protesters debasing themselves in the interest of making sure their candidate won. Hoffman tries to argue with a Republican who wants to stop the count before every county can be recanvassed with the same standards. The image freezes. ""He'd just realized that the whole act of voting and making your voice heard got hijacked by high-powered attorneys,"" says Leitch. The Party's Over ends with a shrug. Bush is inaugurated. Hoffman walks across a crowded New York street. He doesn't have anything to say. ""In the post-production, he wanted to keep the voice-over very brief,"" says Leitch. It wasn't about him. He said, 'This is about a journey I'm going on.' He wanted to just educate himself, not sit there and pontificate. This is a part of Phil that people maybe haven't seen before. Maybe this film can be a way to see him not playing Capote or a cult leader or one of the other roles he played. It's a way to see the real Phil Hoffman."""

Before Sunday night's game, everyone thought the Broncos and Seahawks would have a close one and by the third quarter the Seahawks had so dominated the action, it became necessary to thumb through the rule book to see if pro football had a mercy rule. Traffic from Fort Lee, N.J., is more free-flowing than the Broncos offense. Who knows where the week will end up, but here are three questions worth noodling as it starts: 1. Chris Christie: Does going on offense reinforce negative views of the governor? Monday at 7 p.m. Gov. Chris Christie will take to the airwaves for his regular ""Ask the Governor"" segment. Will he go after his critics in the forceful way his aides have or will he try to stay above the fray? David Wildstein was the Port Authority official who ordered the lane closings on the George Washington Bridge, so when he says he has a version of events that contradicts Christie, it creates tremors. But Wildstein's revelations could be damaging or they could be a bluff. We don't have any evidence yet. Even if we did, the charges he's apparently leveling don't go to the big political issue in the scandal: Whether Christie ordered the lane closures as political retribution or whether he knew about it. Wildstein is silent on this point. What he is saying is that he can contradict what Christie has said about the lane closures once they were under way. If there is a discrepancy, that could further damage the governor's credibility, but right now we wait and see. But Christie isn't waiting. His team put out an exfoliating attack against Wildstein on Saturday, questioning his motives and charging that he's simply trying to save his own hide. In questioning his character, they reached back to his high-school years. (So then why was he entrusted with the Port Authority job in the first place?) The Christie posture since the scandal broke has been to focus on getting work done. There were a few caustic comments from his team about MSNBC's bias, which broke the story about the Hoboken mayor who says she was pressured to approve a development project, but that's it. This response to Wildstein is an escalation. If others come forward to protect themselves and receive the same pounding, the pattern of Christie throwing punches at former friends and allies could become politically damaging in itself--particularly if Christie starts engaging in it himself. In attacking the character of former aides it raises questions about why people whose low character was obvious since high school were on your team. It also might convey the overall impression that when the governor is unhappy he goes after those that make him so. That's a risky impression to court when the larger question is whether the governor knew anything about an overreaction by his political team to a perceived slight. 2. GOP infighting: How fast do we get to questioning motives? There are many dangers to inner-party fights--they waste time, they draw attention from highlighting your opponent's flaws, and they often don't lead to productive legislative results. One of the big downsides is when combatants start questioning each other's motives. That takes a policy debate and turns it into a personal fight where people lock in and get emotional. The resulting attacks hand your opponents powerful sound bites they can use against you. This is what happened during the government shutdown when Republican senators claimed Sen. Ted Cruz had ""tricked the grass roots"" to raise his profile for his presidential run. The charge was an insult to grass-roots conservatives, suggesting they were morons to be led around by the nose, and it was an attack on Cruz's character. When House Speaker John Boehner suggested grass-roots lobbying groups in Washington were fooling the rank and file over the Ryan-Murray budget just to raise money, it was a similar personal attack. Since then, the skirmishing on the right has been mild. The Ryan-Murray budget, the $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill, and the farm bill all passed the House without too much clubhouse fighting. (The ugly personal stuff has been left to Greta Van Susteren and Erick Erickson.) Now comes the conservative conversation about immigration. The issue is so fraught that Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol and the editors of the National Review said Republicans shouldn't touch it for fear they will waste their energy fighting each other and not exploiting the weaknesses of Obamacare. We know it will be a heated debate, but will it be heated in a debilitating personal way that reignites the full fury of the personal war between the populists and establishment? Or, will the recent tactical restraint over budget fights prevail in an election year when Republicans have a shot at taking control of the Senate? 3. Will Obama wimp out on trade? The administration is boasting about all the ways the president can take direct action to get around Republicans in the House. He'll do anything he can to get the economy going. He has both a pen and a phone. One thing he could do to help the economy is to fight for authority to make trade deals without congressional interference. It is within his power to do so and has little to do with congressional Republicans who support the idea. But he may not reach for the phone--or at least he won't engage with the gusto he's putting toward far smaller items he outlined in the State of the Union. Trade promotion authority, sometimes known as ""fast-track,"" is the necessary requirement to finalize the trade discussions with Pacific Rim countries that are currently moving along briskly and the European trade deal that's in a far earlier stage of the process. The administration argues that both will give a real boost to the economy. Trade is always a tough issue for Democrats. Unions worry this will threaten their workers and environmentalists worry it will lead to greater damage to the planet. ""Everyone would be well advised just to not push this right now,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Some Democrats are making the argument similar to the one Republicans are on immigration: Let's not have this ugly fight in the party during an election year when we should be fighting with the other side. Perhaps, but the Obama administration has argued that these trade deals will help the economy, so the sooner the better. The question is: Will politics win out? U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman and White House chief of staff Denis McDonough have been lobbying lawmakers, but lobbyists for business and politicians who support free trade in both parties are asking for more direct pressure from the president. Will Obama make the push? Given how comfortable Democrats are bucking him, would it matter if he did? I asked Obama's top economic adviser Jason Furman how important it was to have trade promotion authority pass in 2014 in order to achieve the best result with ongoing trade deals. ""What's important is that as Ambassador Froman is negotiating with our partners that he can make it very clear to them that as we're asking for concessions from other countries that we're going to be able to deliver and implement those agreements in the United States and that's why it is important to strengthen our hand of our negotiator by having forward momentum,"" he said. Momentum toward authority is different than authority. No one thinks the promise of a congressional vote has the leverage-making power of an actual deal. ""Very few of our U.S. trading partners are going to come to the table with their best offer if it is still possible that the United States Congress could come along and undermine that deal,"" says Bill Frenzel, trade expert at the Brookings Institution and a former member of Congress. ""If the president signs off on an agreement and he doesn't have TPA, he won't be signing off on the best agreement we can get."" Rather, the administration appears to be pre-emptively trying to finesse the practical impact of the stall in Congress and the limited power the president has to change the situation in an election year. That suggests trade authority is something that is going to remain on the president's wish list for a time to come."	Will Christie Go After His Opponents Personally?

12	12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/02/republican_governors_association_outraises_democrats_can_chris_christie.html	"The Republican Governors Association heads into a crucial election year having outraised its Democratic counterpart $50.3 million to $28 million in 2013, thanks largely to donations from corporations and billionaires like industrialist David Koch. Koch, hedge fund chief Paul Singer, casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, and Limited Brands CEO Leslie Wexner each donated more than $1 million to the group last year while tobacco company Reynolds American, Koch Industries, and health insurer Wellpoint each contributed more than $500,000, according to Internal Revenue Service records posted Friday. The cash advantage is welcome given the challenges facing the RGA's leader, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Christie, the RGA chairman, is embroiled in an ongoing scandal in his home state that could make it hard for him to bring in cash and votes in a year when 36 governors' races are on the ballot. With members of his party calling for him to step down, Christie may have trouble matching the Midas touch of former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, who raised a staggering $87 million to help the party capture five new governorships in 2010. In addition, two of the RGA's most reliable and generous donors--Texans Bob Perry and Harold Simmons--died in 2013. Perry was the RGA's most generous benefactor, contributing more than $12 million over the past five years, half the total in 2010 alone. While the RGA will likely still outraise the Democratic Governors Association, it will have to contend with a motivated union political machine that combined with the DGA actually accounted for more outside spending than the RGA in 2012. And money doesn't guarantee success at the ballot box. ""You can't just buy these elections,"" said Kyle Kondik, a political analyst at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. ""There are all sorts of other factors that go into it."" 2014 outlook The early read on 2014 elections is that the Democrats are better poised to win back a few of the governorships they lost in 2010. Recent polls show that fewer than 1 in 4 Pennsylvania voters believe Republican Gov. Tom Corbett deserves a second term, while 46 percent of Florida voters prefer Democratic challenger (and former Republican governor) Charlie Crist to incumbent Republican Gov. Rick Scott. Maine's GOP Gov. Paul LePage, meanwhile, faces a three-way race without a clear-cut favorite. ""The Democrats definitely have some seats to pick and choose from where they have a real chance of winning,"" said Lou Jacobson, the deputy editor of fact-checking website PolitiFact and a gubernatorial handicapper for Governing magazine. The most vulnerable Democrats, meanwhile, appear to be Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, according to recent polls by the left-leaning Public Policy Polling. Arkansas, where Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe is stepping down due to term limits, is also a tossup. Democrats' advantage going into this election year is in part a logical byproduct of Republicans' success in consolidating power in 2010. The GOP controls 29 governorships across the country, and 22 are being contested this year. ""There's just naturally going to be more targets for the party that doesn't hold quite as many seats,"" said Kondik. Even so, he said that with 29 of the 36 elections featuring incumbents, there's likely to be less change than in 2010, when only 13 incumbents were running. The RGA and DGA are what's known as ""527"" groups. They can accept unlimited donations from labor unions, corporations, and individuals but cannot make donations to federal candidates. They can, however, have an impact on the states, where campaign finance rules are often much looser. Maintenance costs Broadly speaking, the RGA's top donors are billionaires and corporations. The DGA relies more on labor unions but also sees its share of corporate money as CEOs hedge their bets. Even without Perry and Simmons, the RGA has plenty of big-money benefactors including Koch and Adelson. Meanwhile, the DGA received first-time donations from billionaire hedge fund managers Paul Tudor Jones and Thomas Steyer, who each gave $250,000. Still, the group's largest donors in 2013 were labor unions and pharmaceutical companies. The International Association of Fire Fighters and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees donated $400,000 and $375,000, respectively, while the drug industry's top lobbying group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, donated $325,000. The heavy corporate and union backing of the groups has raised questions in the past about whether the organizations have avoided bans on corporate and union contributions in state races through the use of a Byzantine network of state and federal finance political action committees. Since 2000, the RGA has given more than $50 million directly to candidates, according to data from the National Institute on Money in State Politics, while the DGA has given nearly $29 million. The Center for Public Integrity reported that in 2010 the Washington, D.C.-based RGA routed $1.5 million first through its state affiliate in Wisconsin and then to its state affiliate in Pennsylvania before the money found its way into Corbett's campaign war chest. Corporate donations are illegal in both Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. That shuffling of funds is fairly common to both groups, said Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, an assistant professor of law at Stetson University who researched their activity between 2002 and 2010. ""It looks like both of the groups [are] really skirting the line,"" she said. It's now much easier for the RGA and DGA to spend money in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling, which invalidated state bans and limits on outside spending by corporations and unions. The spending often comes from groups that do not reveal their backers and use the funds to buy negative television ads and mailers. These groups are not permitted to coordinate with the candidate, however. Those rulings have contributed to a spike in outside spending at the state level. Outside groups, led by the RGA and DGA, spent more than $209 million in 2012, and the amount is expected to be much greater in 2014. It's not clear yet whether Christie's fundraising abilities will be hampered by the ongoing political scandal in his home state. If he were to step down in response to the scandal, he wouldn't be the first governor to do so. Then-South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford abdicated the position after revelations that he had secretly visited his mistress in Argentina while claiming to be hiking the Appalachian Trail. Sanford's departure ushered in Barbour, and with it the most lucrative fundraising period in RGA history. John Dunbar contributed to this report.

And this is true, in the same way it's true to say the Civil War started because some guys in Charleston, S.C., started lobbing cannon balls at Fort Sumter. But the real problem in Atlanta isn't snow; the real problem is history. I grew up in Atlanta and still have scores of friends, former colleagues, and family members in Georgia, so my Facebook feed lit up with snow news long before the first flakes hit. (Southerners greet the prospect of snow with the excitement they usually reserve for rumors of the Second Coming of Jesus. More, actually, since the Second Coming does not entail a frantic race to the store to get milk and toilet paper.) A friend whose office overlooks 10th Street in Midtown posted a picture of the snarled traffic as it was happening, and I knew this was going to be bad, bad, bad. I also knew that I'd be hearing stories about folks coming out to aid stranded motorists, or inviting strangers in for a bowl of hot oatmeal or some such, because Southerners are like that. A New Yorker might go out of his way to help a stranger cross the street in a time of disaster; a Southerner is apt to take him home and cook him dinner. And in fact there were plenty of such vignettes, all of them reminding me of what I miss about living there. ""Proud, brave, honorable by its lights, courteous, personally generous, loyal ... such was the South at its best,"" wrote W. J. Cash in his classic 1941 work, The Mind of the South. So far, so good--but Cash goes on to describe some less appealing but still quintessentially Southern traits, among them being ""suspicion toward new ideas, an incapacity for analysis, an inclination to act from feeling rather than from thought, an exaggerated individualism and a too-narrow sense of social responsibility."" And, of course, ""too great an attachment to racial values""--or, so as not to mince words, racism. What does this have to do with snow? Let us review. ""Exaggerated individualism"" is a pretty good description of the Southern approach to politics--especially in Georgia, which has more counties than any state in the country except Texas. ""Atlanta"" is actually a 10-county metropolitan region which is home to more than 4 million people and 68 separate municipalities. In some places, such an amalgamation might make people think about consolidating services. Not in Atlanta: In Fulton County alone, home to most of the city proper, three suburban municipalities have formed their own governments just since 2005 in an effort to distance themselves from the urban problems of their big-city neighbor, and there's a growing push among residents of the affluent northern end of the county to form a whole new county, as if Georgia doesn't already have enough of those. Secession movements have percolated in various metropolitan areas across the country for years, and lately western Maryland and the entire state of Texas, among other places, have made a lot of noise about seceding from greater Maryland and the United States, respectively. But in the Deep South, people don't just talk about secession; they do it. Southerners love them some local ""gummit,"" the local-er the better. But when regional disaster hits--whether it's the years-long drought of a few years back, or this week's snowstorm--that means umpteen local and state politicians have to work together on a deadline, putting aside their various ambitions and competing constituencies under adverse conditions in order to deal with a common threat. It could work in theory, I guess, but here's how it looks in practice: Then there's the part about having ""too narrow a sense of social responsibility."" Exhibit A here is the failure in 2012 of a massive $7.2 billion transportation initiative, which would have paid for sorely needed regional highway improvements and funneled $600 million into the Atlanta Beltline, an innovative proposal to link neighborhoods in the city by light rail, using 22 miles of abandoned cargo lines left over from Atlanta's heyday as a railroad hub. To which the voters of the metropolitan Atlanta area said: Hell, no. Here is a region that even without freak snowstorms is choking on its own traffic, which has built its reputation on being a transportation hub, which is looking at a future when gas will never be less than $3 a gallon again, and all voters could think about was how much they hated government and paying taxes. They had their reasons--Georgia has no shortage of political corruption, and in 2012 the economy was still deeply in the tank--but even so, it was like watching folks refuse to get out of a burning house because they objected to the way the firemen were holding the ladder. And, of course, there's race. Race is a recurring motif in the long history of the city-rural divide in Georgia politics, as well as the uneasy history of relations between the leaders in City Hall and the state Capitol just down the street. Much as white Southerners despise being labeled ""racist"" whenever they vote Republican--and I do understand why that makes them mad--it is still a fact that you cannot separate anything in the South entirely from the question of race. I was a kid when then-Mayor Ivan Allen Jr. proposed a rapid rail system to link Atlanta to its surrounding suburbs, and I distinctly remember the joke circulating among white people back then, the one that said that MARTA (the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority) actually stood for ""Moving Africans Rapidly Through Atlanta."" Plain and simple, it was white folks' fear of black folks that explained the failure of a sales-tax hike to fund rapid rail in three of the then five counties making up the metro Atlanta area. Today, Atlanta's rapid rail map looks kind of like a crooked plus sign that doesn't venture outside Fulton County and part of DeKalb, instead of the web of rail lines connecting the entire region that was originally envisioned. The results are not just suburban sprawl, which Atlanta is hardly the only city to suffer from; another result is widening income inequality--which Atlanta leads the nation in, by the way--since sprawl creates a dearth of close-in affordable housing and forces poor people spend a larger portion of their income on transportation. Today, Atlanta's affluent northern suburbs, which have no mass transit, stretch practically to Chattanooga--and south Fulton County, which does, is a sea of mostly poor, mostly black neighborhoods. But at least those black folks in south Fulton--who benefit from mass transit because they live close to Hartsfield International Airport--got to take the train home on Tuesday night, so there's that. For generations, the South has been labeled a backward region, a reputation it has yet to completely outgrow, but I see it as the opposite: It's a region that has confronted enormous challenges, and results, as they say, have varied. Industrial, large-scale agriculture? The South pioneered it in the early 19th century, on the backs of slave labor, and we discovered that it strips the land of nutrients and enriches the few at the expense of the many. (This is a discovery we have yet to communicate well to the rest of the world, though God knows Wendell Berry and his friends are trying.) Race? Still working on that, though arguably we've made more progress than other places--and here I'm talking about little-noticed but very active grassroots racial reconciliation efforts across the South, not to mention the South's explosion in the number of black elected officials over the last half century. And now, here's a major Southern city confronting the problem of how to survive the 21st century. I think it's safe to say that this week, Atlanta conclusively demonstrated what is never, ever going to work. The way forward is complicated, to say the least--but it's hard to know where you're going without a clear idea of where you've been. Southerners are notoriously poor at understanding our own history--there's so much of it, and so much is painful--but here, today, is a really good place to start."	Snow Didn't Paralyze Atlanta. Racism Did.	['Allen']	['god']
14	14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/01/barack_obama_state_of_the_union_proposals_the_president_s_ideas_feel_too.html	"""America does not stand still,"" said President Obama in his State of the Union address, ""and neither will I."" For the next hour the president plotted the path he would walk and the strides he would take to get around the members of Congress who had blocked his path before. But when the speech was over, the president hadn't moved very far at all. He was still a leader entangled by Congress and the Constitution. In the lead-up to the speech, the president and his aides talked about how he was going to use the tools of his office--the pen and the phone--to address the challenges of the day since Congress would not. But, judging from his speech, you can't do much with a pen and phone. When the president outlined his executive actions, the biggest items were a modest effort to raise the minimum wage for companies with federal contracts, six additional manufacturing hubs, and an ill-defined savings instrument aimed at making it easier for lower-income Americans to sock away money. Those are hardly initiatives that amount to a ""year of action."" The rest of his offerings were even smaller--cajoling CEOs, convening college professors, and cutting red tape. He put Vice President Biden in charge of improving the 47 government job-training programs. It's not that these are unworthy efforts. They're just modest compared with the president's stated goal, of reversing decades-long changes in the workforce brought about by global competition and technological innovation. Indeed, you can't imagine a president asking Americans to assemble to hear this list of proposals if there wasn't a tradition saying he had to. The president and his team are hoping that small programs will create a ""foothold,"" produce some good results, and then expand beyond their original design. By raising the minimum wage for employers who sign new federal contracts, for example, administration aides hope for a multiplier effect that will go beyond the limited number of employees who will benefit directly from the raise to $10.10 an hour. The idea, explains a senior administrative official, is that a big company that has to meet the minimum wage for contracting will feel pressure to raise the wage for the whole workforce, which will then compel a competitor to do the same in order to stay competitive when hiring new workers. The president's proposal to fund school modernization would work along the same theory. Though the funding would only cover a limited number of school districts that competed for the dollars, an aide said it would create demand. The losing school districts would call their members of Congress and pressure them to raise funding so that they could update their facilities, too. The president is pinning these policies on a lot of hope. That's because--as becomes abundantly clear when you hear his aides explain how they arrived at some of these executive measures--he is operating under legal constraints that make it hard for a president to do much. His minimum wage effort is limited to companies entering into new contracts, because his authority to do it comes from his power to do things that are good for the ""efficiency"" of the government. The minimum wage increase can be defended on those grounds, say officials, because studies show it leads to retention. But it can't be applied to all existing contracts because that would require ripping up those agreements, which is hard to defend as efficient. It was hard to pin the White House down on specifics behind some of the programs. The manufacturing hubs, for example, require a sustained level of funding to help innovative businesses get on their feet and thrive. The money for the initial experiments in Ohio and North Carolina was found in the defense and energy budgets. Is there enough money for the six more the president promised and to sustain the investment for a sufficient duration? White House aides would not immediately say. ""If you have uncertain funding for a very short time, the danger would be that you have startups that can't scale up and then remain in a kid of zombie limbo,"" says Mark Muro, policy director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. The president says he is focused on the big issue--the welfare of the middle class--and that he is doing everything he possibly can to further that goal. If better posture would help, he'd sit up straight, on the theory of his speech that every bit counts. But to take big strides the president needs Congress's cooperation, which meant this ended up being a thoroughly conventional speech in which he called on his audience to help him enact tax reform, extend unemployment benefits, reform immigration laws, raise the minimum wage, and expand the Earned Income Tax Credit to apply to workers without children. The speech still had some nice turns. ""Give America a raise,"" the president said after making the case for the popular minimum wage increase. When he called for equal pay for women, he received an extended standing ovation. We'll hear about that again this election year. Otherwise there were only a few mild political moments, the most astringent coming when he tweaked GOP House members for their obsession with defunding Obamacare. Though the president was telling his audience he was going around them, there was nothing dour about his pitch. And given that he was demonstrating all of the ways he has come to terms with the constraints of his job, he nevertheless had a certain lightness in his delivery. The president began with a testimony to the grit of the American people. He was returning to his talent as a storyteller. He didn't just assert, he drew little sketches of hardworking everyday Americans--the entrepreneur, the teacher, the autoworker--who represented the grit that carried people through the recession and positioned the country to take off, if only its leaders would just get out of the way. This was a speech calling for action in the name of the Americans who already had taken action. The president wanted to follow their example. He returned to this emotional theme at the end of the evening when he told the story of Army Ranger Cory Remsburg. He had been injured on his 10th tour of duty and has battled back from a traumatic brain injury. The president shot him a thumbs up as he struggled to stand, assisted by his father. Remsburg returned the gesture. It led to what some observers believe was the longest sustained ovation in the history of the State of the Union. Everyone stood together to salute the hero. Now we'll see if the only thing they can do together is stand still or if the president and his audience can get up and move."	"Obama Said He Won't ""Stand Still.""

You are pathologically regimented and nerdy almost beyond belief. You are penny-wise and pound-freaking-ridiculous. Every now and then your behavior is simply reprehensible. So maybe this is perverse, because also--ewww--you're my uncle. But I am so in love with you. Let me count the ways: You protect me from terrorists and pathogens and pollution and bigots and foreign armies and racketeers. You enforce a semblance of order in the neighborhood and in the marketplace. You finance stuff that I use all the time, more or less for free: bridges, dams, GPS, federal reserve banks, crash-test dummies (indirectly), and Medicare (soon).

Stealth fighter shmealth shmighter, we're talking 30 extra yards off the tee, baby. Also you invented the Internet, which is soooo great for global communications and last-minute shopping.

Twice in the past 85 years, from the New Deal to TARP, you saved the world from financial Armageddon. In the 20th century you defeated both fascism and communism--because of, not in spite of, your gigantism. So when the haters mock your size and the size of your heart, it breaks mine. When Newt Gingrich flamed you in his book (""The secular socialist machine represents as great a threat to America as Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union once did."") it was like seeing you rank last in ""Hot or Not."" All love, it is said, begins with pity. Big Government, will you be my Valentine? Truthfully, this was love at first sight. You didn't even have to offer Big Bird or Obamacare. You had me at the Louisiana Purchase--a huge federal expenditure guaranteeing westward expansion. Fifteen states emerged, in whole or in part, from that budget-busting, tax-and-spend initiative--13 of them red.* That was a Thomas Jefferson deal. So much for the modest federal aspirations of the founders. In fact, as historian Steven Conn of Ohio State likes to point out, the very first act of Congress after authorizing itself was an economic-stimulus law, Alexander Hamilton's pet Tariff Act of 1789 protecting domestic manufacturing and paying off debts from the Revolutionary War. The Postal Act of 1792 did in the 18th century what the Internet has done in modern times: connected a far-flung world and marketplace. The transcontinental railroad joined the coasts via federal land with federal loans. The Homestead Acts lured settlers to the Wild West, a centurylong land redistribution program ... conceived by Republicans. Pretty ironic, eh? Oh, Big Government, not only does conservative dogma ignore the GOP's proud history, it ignores some bedrock conservative values--such as, just to name one, law and order. The same folks who demand you frisk loiterers want you to leave oil companies and banks unmolested by tyrannical job-killing measures like, whaddya call them ... laws. I feel for you, ya big lug. You're so ungainly next to the sleek and comely free market, but let's not forget that the captains of industry, with alarming frequency, go all Bligh on us: BP (manslaughter), GlaxoSmithKline (suppressing bad clinical news and illegally marketing unapproved drugs), JPMorgan Chase (subprime recklessness), Philip-Morris (lying merchants of cancer), Archer Daniels Midland (price fixing), HSBC (abetting drug-cartels' money laundering), Enron (megafraud), Comcast (just plain sucking). Yes, as I constantly say, among the things the free market is free of is conscience. Now don't go getting a big head, my dearest Uncle Sam, because in addition to a century of human bondage you have plenty to answer for. Spying on your own citizens is merely your latest outrage. Who can forget the CIA overthrows? The World War II internment of Japanese Americans. The Trail of Tears. The Vietnam War. The Red Scare. Tuskegee. The Amtrak cafe car. And yet I'm prepared to be forgiving. Social Security. Yellowstone. The Sherman Antitrust Act. Dude, memory foam! Yes, plutonium and weaponized bacteria aren't the only things developed in a government lab. Touch-screen technology, too. Whatever number of $600 hammers went into my ATM and Tempur-Pedic pillow is fine by me. Anyway, per the corporate crimes and misdemeanors listed above, you have no monopoly on institutional transgression. You do, however, have a monopoly on protecting the public from monopolies. And hostile ICBMs. And salmonella. With all due respect to the rights of individual states, some functions require scale. New Mexico Division of Antitrust? Arkansas Institutes of Health? Vermont Aviation Administration? Alaska Department of Defense? As somebody once said, thanks but no thanks. Also, some things even private industry isn't industrious enough for. To whom should we outsource food inspections or air traffic control ... Blackwater? But now there's a Blue Scare, and they're hating on you. They loathe your debt and your giveaways to freeloaders like the elderly, the poor, the unemployed, the war-disabled, and the just plain unlucky. They want the unregulated economy's lucre to simply trickle down, like fracking-lubricated ground water, to the disadvantaged. As Florida Sen. Marco Rubio says, ""Free enterprise makes people prosperous, all people prosperous, and big government makes people poorer."" But, gosh, Big Government, one of the things I so love about you is your generosity--not to welfare queens but to free enterprise itself. On top of the bridges and that other infrastructure you built, the stable society you have sustained through your do-gooder entitlement largesse offers business a dependable, educated workforce and vast affluent consumer base more or less entirely unwiped-out by famine, epidemic, civil strife, or grinding poverty. In other words, the supposed welfare state your enemies so despise is the ultimate trickle-down corporate welfare. As for spending, it's so infuriating when folks like House Budget Committee member Bill Flores start running you down. (""Every American family and 49 out of 50 states currently abide by some form of a balanced-budget requirement. If they can make the hard choices to pay their bills and live within their means, then Washington should too."") But, dearest one, two-thirds of American families do live with huge debt burdens ... called ""mortgages."" Flores has two of them, totaling about $1.5 million. Last I checked, he hadn't been strangled. At business school nobody calls debt a noose. They call it a lever. That's why corporations indebt themselves to the tune of trillions of dollars. Gee, Unc, you don't hear Grover Norquist badmouthing bonds. Yet he blackmails legislators into signing an anti-tax pledge. Why? Compared to the rest of the industrialized world, you tax us so little. In terms of individual tax rates, you are in the middle of the pack. As a percentage of GDP, at 27.3 percent you are near the bottom, 29 spots below Denmark (48 percent), one above Turkey. In a month or two, I'm going to file my tax return, SWAK. Think of my check this way: sweets for my sweet. Big Government, be mine. Correction, Feb. 14, 2014: This article originally stated that all 15 states that emerged from the Louisiana Purchase are now red states. Thirteen of the 15 are red states. (Return.)"

16	16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/02/scott_walker_and_the_2016_presidential_election_the_wisconsin_governor_benefits.html	"Valentine's Day isn't just a Hallmark holiday for people in Wisconsin. It's also the anniversary of the first protests against Gov. Scott Walker after he proposed his anti-union legislation in 2011. Students and teaching assistants were on the front lines of the protests, walking out of class to march up State Street to the Capitol with bullhorns and leaving ""valentines"" outside Walker's office asking him to change his mind. During that month, the crowd of protesters swelled to 30,000, then 100,000. But three years later, the valentines are gone. The thousands of people who came for the protests and counterprotests are gone. The stands selling anti-Walker buttons and shirts emblazoned with the pro-union groups' iconic blue fist are gone, too. The packs of people with bullhorns aren't roaming downtown anymore. Now, only a handful of people gather in the Capitol rotunda every day at noon to sing protest songs. But guess who is still here? This November, Walker will fight his third gubernatorial race in four years. And although he's not as loathed as he was three years ago, Wisconsin is just as polarized. After all, this is a state whose two senators vote against each other more often than any two senators from the same state. This is a state where the first openly gay senator elected cannot get married. This is a state that petitioned for a historic recall (disclosure: I signed the petition), then overturned it. This is an electorate who voted for Walker in June, then voted for President Obama in November of the same year. ""This is a state that does not have uniformly predictable aggregate political views,"" says Kenneth Mayer, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""That's an academic way of saying people don't vote the same way, and it can be hard to predict."" The state of Wisconsin is in a semi-permanent identity crisis, and that crisis has both helped Walker gain statewide prominence and made people want to kick him out of office. But the June 2012 recall election against Walker could severely backfire on the people who organized it. ""For Walker, the recall is in some ways the gift that keeps on giving,"" says Charles Franklin, who runs the Marquette University Law School Poll. ""The recall established him nationally in conservative circles, gave him much more visibility nationally than he would have had otherwise, and most importantly let him have a national fundraising base."" That national fundraising base has been a mixed blessing for Walker. A prank call that he credulously took from a radio host impersonating David Koch will haunt him for the rest of his career. The cost may have been worth it, though--the real David Koch donated $1 million to groups supporting Walker in 2012, and the Koch-funded group Americans for Prosperity shelled out $10 million on behalf of the governor. Other out-of-state millionaires like Sheldon Adelson and Foster Friess also got in the race. But it's not just a handful of wealthy magnates financing his campaign--just take a look at this map of Walker contributions from 2012. Since Act 10--Walker's controversial collective bargaining law aimed at labor unions--was introduced, only 38 percent of donations to Walker's campaign have come from inside the state. That isn't to say Walker does not have support within Wisconsin--after all, he won the recall election by a wider margin than when he was first elected in 2010. Surprisingly, Walker's job approval has fluctuated very little during the past two years, especially when compared to other divisive governors from the 2010 class like John Kasich of Ohio. ""The consistency over a two-year period is striking for how harsh political attitudes toward Walker have been,"" Franklin says. But more than the lingering resentment over his collective bargaining law, Walker will have to grapple with slow job growth. In his 2010 campaign, Walker promised to create 250,000 jobs during his first term. With one year left, that number is less than halfway there. Wisconsin ranks 37th in job creation in that time, lagging behind other Midwestern states. Social issues could also affect Walker's fortunes. In June, Walker signed a mandatory ultrasound bill, which included a provision that would have shuttered the only Planned Parenthood abortion clinic outside of Milwaukee and Madison. That part of the law has been tied up in the courts.* He also turned down expanded Medicaid funds from Obamacare, leaving 83,000 people living below the poverty line to wait until spring for state coverage. Enter Mary Burke, Walker's Democratic opponent. Burke's main strength is in her family business, Trek, which employs 1,600 people. But two weeks after Burke entered the race, 70 percent of Wisconsin residents either had no opinion of her or didn't know who she was. That number was the same three months later. Although she's more charismatic than Walker's former opponent, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, she still risks running the same sort of phlegmatic campaign that cost Barrett the recall election. Burke has never run a partisan campaign, and her idealism shows. Instead of focusing on high-profile events in Madison or Milwaukee, Burke drives around the state seven days a week in her Ford Escape to meet with locals. She's also stressed that she wants the majority of her contributions to come from Wisconsin residents. Though she opposes Act 10, Burke doesn't want to use that as a wrecking ball against Walker, according to Burke spokesman Joe Zepecki. Instead, they'll be campaigning on jobs and raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour--an idea 62 percent of voters support and Walker vehemently opposes. In the meantime, the Republican Party of Wisconsin has already scooped up maryburke.com and is defining her as ""Madison Millionaire Mary Burke."" (Of course, Republicans touted fellow millionaire Ron Johnson as a ""jobs creator"" when he ran for Senate in 2010.) At this stage, Burke needs to tap wealthy in-state donors. Her campaign raised a healthy $1.7 million by the end of the year--a figure tripled by the Walker campaign. ""Scott Walker is going to have more money than we do. We know that,"" Zepecki says. ""We don't need to outspend him--we need to spend smarter."" Could election fatigue also cause a lower turnout? Not likely, Franklin says. Still, it's been enough of a drain that one-third of voters have stopped talking to friends and family members about politics because of conflicts over the recall. ""There's certainly been a cost, psychically, to the public,"" Franklin said. ""They decided it was better to stop talking about it at all."" Even if voters don't want to talk about it, the implications of the upcoming election may be even bigger this time around. The 2014 election is just one variable in a potential Walker 2016 presidential run. There have certainly been plenty of think pieces speculating that he's going to run for president, and Walker isn't doing much to dispel the rumors. He's a regular on Morning Joe and at national Republican events, he headed the Republican Governors Association, he writes op-eds in the Washington Post about the state of national politics, and he came out with a memoir last year. He gets around. ""He is very ambitious, he's frequently underestimated, and he's young,"" Mayer says. ""Republicans love him, Democrats loathe him ... Ronald Reagan was the same."" (Walker name-dropped Reagan 11 times in his memoir.) But unlike Reagan, Walker is no great orator, and he certainly doesn't sound like a Beltway insider. Unlike his fellow Wisconsinite Paul Ryan, Walker sports a thick ""Mawaukee"" accent--just listen to any of his speeches about growing ""jabs"" in ""Wis-CAN-sin."" At this point, the question isn't so much ""Will Walker run?"" as ""Why wouldn't he?"" That said, it's hard to predict what lurking scandal could upend a governor's ambitions in the next two years (see: Christie, Chris). Walker is already entangled in a complex John Doe investigation examining outside groups' spending during the recall. The Wisconsin Club for Growth has sued to shut down the investigation, but it's unclear whether the fundraising shadiness could be linked back to Walker. At an event in Washington to promote his book a few months ago, Walker was asked who his ideal candidate for president would be. Walker's response sounded suspiciously familiar: ""An ideal candidate to me would be a current or former governor,"" Walker said. ""Just because I think governors have executive experience and, more importantly, I think there's a real sense across America that people want an outsider."" Correction, Feb. 12, 2014: This article originally said Wisconsin's mandatory ultrasound law shut down a Planned Parenthood abortion clinic. That provision of the law is being challenged in court, and the clinic in question remains open."

17	17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/02/hillary_clinton_chris_christie_and_ruthless_politicians_why_there_isn_t.html	"Let us now praise ruthless men. And women. The two most talked-about potential presidential candidates in 2016 are enduring public examinations of their ruthlessness. In New Jersey federal investigators, the legislature, and the press are looking at whether Gov. Chris Christie knew aides in his office sought to punish a local official for not supporting their boss by closing portions of the George Washington Bridge. At the same time, Hillary Clinton is going through one of the periodic public checkups she has enjoyed since emerging on the national stage in 1992. A new book, HRC, describes a carefully tended Clinton enemies list where the couple kept track of those who had abandoned or betrayed them. The private diaries of a close confidante, first reported on by the Washington Free Beacon, describe first lady Hillary Clinton's desire to punish everyone from anonymous leakers to an Arkansas publisher during her husband's presidency. Partisans react to these developments predictably; your opponent's penchant for ruthlessness is a sign of his or her low character. That's wrong. Ruthlessness is a necessary political skill, particularly for presidents. The task is to make an assessment about whether a particular politician uses it effectively or not. There are limits to ruthlessness--abuse of power and crippling vindictiveness--but we shouldn't mistake signs of the trait as necessary proof a politician is locked into its excesses. Politics is a profession so clouded with self-love, self-dealing, and greed that in some cases the only way you can make progress is if you use a pickax. That means knowing how to use intimidation and retribution--and recognizing that every tool of the office can be a weapon if you hold it right. In presidential campaigns some voters are uncomfortable with politicians who show an aptitude for arm-twisting. That, in turn, leads to a lot of wasted time as politicians pretend that they are not skilled in the activities required for the job that they're trying so hard to get. It gets circular fast: You deceive to prove that you are not deceptive. Democratic strategist James Carville once famously compared Hillary Clinton with President Obama by suggesting the former first lady had more guts than the president, though Carville referred to a part of the anatomy physiologically unavailable to a female candidate. Reading Diane Blair's journals you see what Carville was talking about. ""HC still in despair that nobody in WH tough and mean enough,"" writes the political science professor, a longtime Arkansas friend of the Clintons, who died in 2000 and whose papers were donated to the University of Arkansas. ""Most people in this town have no pain threshold,"" she quotes Clinton as saying in another entry. When something is blocked in the White House, ""HC urging hard ball."" Hillary Clinton spends the weekend reorganizing the White House, planning firings and punishing leakers, but Blair says it ultimately frustrates the first lady because her husband won't pull the trigger. These are stories about events more than 20 years ago, but they read with potency because they offer an intimate portrait of a figure who has worked hard to shield herself from penetrating insights. If voters are ambivalent about toughness in their politicians, they are particularly so about it in female politicians. One of the benefits of the Diane Blair documents is that they offer us a historical marker for national attitudes about women and power in the early 1990s before Clinton became the most influential American female politician of her time. ""What voters find slick in Bill Clinton, they find ruthless in Hillary,"" reads a strategy memo in the files from the 1992 campaign. ""While voters genuinely admire Hillary Clinton's intelligence and tenacity, they are uncomfortable with these traits in a woman. She needs to project a softer side--some humor, some informality."" As first lady, Clinton was a ""pioneer in an anachronistic role,"" as Blair put it. More than 20 years later, Clinton may still have less room to appear tough than a male candidate. But the question about Clinton's toughness isn't limited to public perceptions about it. Now the question is, when does ruthlessness cross the line beyond its utilitarian benefits and into something more damaging? Presidents need to be self-confident but not arrogant, focused but not living in a bubble, wise but not too professorial, a leader but not a tyrant. The Christie and Clinton stories offer us an opportunity to examine where ruthlessness should begin and end in the most powerful office in the land. In New Jersey the ruthlessness of the Christie operation bled over into its abuse of power, but so far there is no connection between Christie and his aides. In the Blair documents, Clinton is ruthless in conversation in a way that we never have seen with Christie. It's gripping reading, but it's more figurative than real; Clinton couldn't abuse power because as first lady she had none. Furthermore, the machismo displayed in private conversations with a friend requires a caveat. It's possible that Clinton, powerless and under siege, talked tougher on the phone precisely because she couldn't follow through in real life. Abuse of power is not the only downside of ruthlessness. The danger is that it can lead to an all-consuming vindictiveness. There is nothing wrong per se with an enemies list of the kind reported in HRC. In a business of leverage and power, it's almost a best practice. Bill Clinton raised money for Sen. Claire McCaskill, and then she said she wouldn't let him near her daughter. She also endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary. That would seem to be the kind of offense so glaring you wouldn't need a cheat sheet to remember it. But politics can get confusing. McCaskill has already endorsed Hillary for president in 2016. But there were also lesser officeholders who caused offense who occupied the enemies list spreadsheet, and in ensuing elections for attorney general and Congress, Bill Clinton campaigned in Democratic primaries against candidates who had backed Obama against his wife. Tending to a list of enemies and ingrates can become a problem if imagining and carrying out retribution become the focus of too many hours in the day. You lose the theme of your office. Before Richard Nixon graduated to abusing power, he was consumed with his political enemies. So if the question for Christie is whether the culture of easy retribution fostered the excesses of the George Washington Bridge scandal, the question for Clinton is whether the constant attention to allies and enemies can ever become an overwhelming distraction. It hasn't in some of Clinton's relationships. She does not hold grudges when they become impractical, the best example of that being her reconciliation with Barack Obama and her constant and unwavering loyalty to him. She developed a relationship with Gen. David Petraeus, even though she essentially accused him of misleading the country about the Iraq war. In the Blair documents, Clinton even seems to offer a kind word for former Sen. Al D'Amato, whom she nevertheless loathed for his attacks during the investigations into the Clintons' Whitewater investments. If you spend all your time erecting battlements, it becomes a prison. This is where President Obama's Hawaii demeanor helps him, say those who have worked for him. He doesn't become consumed with combat. One thing that is clear from the Blair documents is that the Clinton White House was a near-constant state of chaotic confrontation. According to Blair, the weight of that siege, and maintaining the constant mask that they weren't bothered by it at all, is what Hillary says led her husband to have an affair with Monica Lewinsky. But Blair's notes are from a time capsule: They capture part of Clinton's worldview from almost 20 years ago, when she responded to the pressure cooker with off-key comments about having chosen a career instead of baking cookies and countered truthful reports by saying they were the product of a vast right-wing conspiracy. She has had two distinct careers since then, in the Senate and the State Department, which show no evidence of the debilitating embattlement that consumed those early Clinton years. But those periods are also obscured, particularly the events leading up to and after the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, so there's still much to be assessed. Ruthless is not a word associated with Barack Obama's style of politics. Many of his supporters wish he were tougher with Republicans. As Dan Balz reports in Collision 2012, when Obama's pollsters held focus groups, they kept hearing people talk about Lyndon Johnson. Voters wanted Obama to embody a little of LBJ's bareknuckle grit because they thought it would make him more effective with Congress. As former Defense Secretary Robert Gates writes, Obama, like Bush before him, was ""neither particularly liked nor feared. Accordingly, neither had many allies in Congress who were willing to go beyond party loyalty, self-interest, or policy agreement in supporting them."" President Obama's 2008 message of progress through cooperation is not available to candidates in 2016. Instead, the intense partisanship of the day means a successful candidate is likely to have more success convincing voters that cooperation will come through strength and steel. In that case, Clinton, will be making an implicit claim that she is tougher than the man whom she seeks to replace. It will be another pioneering role."

18	18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/02/ahmed_maher_and_activists_imprisoned_egypt_s_revolutionaries_are_now_the.html	"During his first two weeks in Cairo's notorious Tora Prison, Ahmed Maher was able to smuggle out a few letters that he had scribbled on toilet paper. Maher is the soft-spoken 33-year-old civil engineer who co-founded the April 6 Youth Movement and was a crucial behind-the-scenes operator during the 2011 protests that toppled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak three years ago today. Maher has now been in prison for 72 days. His family is having difficulty getting information about his wellbeing, although he has occasionally dictated letters to visitors, including this one, published last week by the Washington Post, and this one, sent to me yesterday. In one of his earlier messages, Maher wrote of conditions in the jail, joking that his food, at least, would stay well-preserved. ""I don't think there is a refrigerator anywhere colder than this cell."" For the most part, however, his letters have been scathing indictments of Egypt's military and warned of catastrophic social unrest if the ""police state"" continues its campaign to dismantle the groups that came together for the 2011 Revolution. That dismantling has gone largely unnoticed by the West. Outside of Egypt, news about the country suggests a binary struggle. On one side: the Muslim Brotherhood, angered over the ouster of President Mohammad Morsi and pushing back against oppression, real or perceived. On the other side: The military-led government of Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who appears poised to run for president. The election, conflict between the military and the Muslim Brotherhood, and Morsi's trial are all obviously newsworthy. (Soundproof cage? Seriously, Egypt?) Squeezed out of most coverage, however, is the fate of secular activists, many of whom are now behind bars: Maher, Mohammed Adel, and Ahmed Douma of the April 6 Youth Movement, as well as organizers like Alaa Abdel Fattah. Others have been expelled from politics with the help of smear campaigns (Wael Ghonim and Asmaa Mahfouz), or face changes and prohibitions on travel that effectively neutralize their political influence (Mostafa Al-Naggar and Amr Hamzawy). And there are others. Three years ago, we cheered for these activists, humbled by their courage and dazzled by their ability to mobilize peaceful demonstrations with the use of new and old technology alike: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, secret meetings, messages written on banknotes, patriotic songs, flowers, and an occupied public square that captivated the world. When Mubarak finally stepped down, Egypt's daring revolutionaries became activist rock stars, nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize and taking meetings with Prime Minister David Cameron, Sen. John McCain, and other world leaders. A stable democracy for Egypt was no sure bet, but thanks to people like Maher and the everyday citizens who took to the streets, the despot was gone. We could at least exhale--and change the channel. When we did, Mubarak regime holdovers began a systematic crackdown on leading dissidents, while smothering unfavorable press coverage. In 2013, Egypt made the Committee to Protect Journalists' top-10 list of countries that jail reporters, and was the world's third deadliest country for journalists, behind Syria and Iraq. Last fall, realizing it could do better than merely quash media coverage of politically inconvenient voices, the interim government decided to simply ban public protests. That brazen new law is what is being used to justify Maher's incarceration. ""It should be clear to all by now,"" Maher wrote, ""that we are dealing with a military dictatorship that rejects any opposing views that do not serve its interests, and that deals with peaceful expression of opinion with tragically familiar tactics: swift detentions, torture, and even murder."" Washington was late to the party in 2011--on the wrong side of history, as President Obama might put it, if not now than in some future memoir. The question today is whether Egypt and the world will stand with the people who put so much on the line three years ago, or accept what is looking more and more like a redux of the Mubarak regime. In the letter received yesterday, Maher put it this way: ""To say that the U.S. and the rest of the world are turning a blind eye to oppression is an understatement."" But he has not lost hope. Keenly aware that he occupies the moral high ground, Maher wrote in one of his smuggled letters that reversion to iron-fisted methods of old is doomed to fail. ""There will come a day when everyone will wake up."" Wake up again, that is, more determined than ever to do away with the old guard."

19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/02/heritage_foundation_ideas_summit_the_conservative_think_tank_wants_to_put.html	"House Speaker John Boehner must have had nightmares like this: Sen. Ted Cruz, speaking before banks of cameras and a rapt press corps, planting his boots behind a podium that read Heritage Action for America. Here was the senator who goaded Republicans into forcing the government shutdown; here was the unaccountable 501(c)3 that backed him up. And here they were lecturing, just a few hours before a special House Republican meeting on how to raise the debt limit without further humiliation. But the Texas senator wasn't talking about health care. He'd come to talk up the American Energy Renaissance Act, one of 10 real-enough policy proposals that would be explained during the ""2014 Conservative Policy Summit: An Agenda to Unite America."" Cruz's bill, which will not make it through the Democratic-controlled Senate, would give an OK to the Keystone Pipeline and bar any further regulations on fracking. A printed schedule said he would speak for 15 minutes and do a 15-minute Q-and-A. Thirty-four minutes later, Cruz said ""thank you,"" ended the speech, and exited stage right. The press corps escaped the auditorium and snaked around to the narrow space between the exit and the elevators. Reporters asked what size and model of wrench Cruz planned to throw into the debt limit negotiations. ""We'll have to wait and see what the details are,"" said Cruz, ""but in my view we should not raise the debt ceiling without significant structural reforms that fix the tide and stop the out-of-control spending."" The senator left the building. Half of the press and nearly half the crowd left with him. The lost body heat sent a chill around the 230-seat auditorium. This was, Heritage Action's Tim Chapman COO suggested to me, pretty standard for the media--give 'em 10 actual policies to cover and watch them get distracted by a fight. ""No offense."" None taken, but who can blame the press? Last year, they watched Heritage Action send foundation president Jim DeMint on a national speaking tour and demand that any House Republican budget cut the funding for Obamacare. The resultant government shutdown ended when the Republicans funded Obamacare. To this day Republicans can't agree on whose fault this was. On The Tonight Show last month, Boehner credited his party with starting the ""predictable disaster."" On Monday, after his Conservative Policy Summit speech about health care, Georgia Rep. Tom Price told reporters that ""the president wanted to shut the government down, and he did."" The summit was a chance to move on. A member of Congress would mention his most daring bill; a panel of policy mavens would discuss it. There would be bathroom and networking breaks, but no free lunch. It was down to business. ""I suppose, at times, it's tempting to just sit back and be snide about the many failures of liberalism and big government,"" said DeMint in his opening remarks. ""With examples like Detroit and Obamacare, it's just too easy."" Heritage Action was kicking off 2014 by featuring ideas that could win ""broad agreement"" from most of America, because ""a mandate for conservatives without a plan, without an agenda, without legislation, is no mandate at all."" This did not mean a less pugnacious version of Republicanism, or that the Heritage teams had been wrong to fight last year. When a questioner prodded DeMint to talk about the farm bill, which had been delayed for half a year by conservative protests and passed over Heritage Action's opposition, the former senator declared a TKO. ""We helped Americans see that the farm bill is not really a farm bill,"" he said. ""It's 80 percent food stamps, and the spending on food stamps had increased dramatically. They cut it back a little bit. If we hadn't forced a debate on it, there wouldn't have been any debate on food stamps. We didn't win the argument, but I think we made it a little harder next time to pass a farm bill without reforms."" DeMint passed the microphone to Heritage Action president Michael Needham, whom the media has settled on as the scheming Oz of the activist right. Needham was less cheery than DeMint. ""America did not get to move our agriculture policy into the 21st century,"" he said. ""We've kept the same Soviet-style ag policies that this country has had for decades."" Later, outside the auditorium, he explained that this was not necessarily a negative view of things. ""You had, I think, $110 million spent in nine months from the farm lobby to pass this bill,"" said Needham. ""That's more than labor unions spent. It was huge. A farm bill was going to be passed at some point, but the fact that it took this long is really good news for getting reform in the long term, because nobody wants to go through this again. People are going to want to sit down and talk, and ask: What are good ideas on the left, on the right?"" There's a third question, one that Needham didn't mention. At what point does a conservative idea stop being conservative and start being another failure of liberalism that a group like Heritage Action needs to oppose? It was in this building, after all, that scholars developed the idea of an individual health care mandate--clearly, a superior and market-based way of bringing the country closer to universal coverage. The Obama administration will probably never tire of reminding conservatives where the mandate came from. Sure enough, Obamacare and its problems vexed the congressmen and wonks of the summit. ""Obamacare took a lot of our labels,"" said Tim Chapman. ""They stole them from us--choice, freedom, that kind of stuff."" ""It's the entire dictionary of public policy!"" said Grace-Marie Turner, president of the conservative Galen Institute. ""They've taken our talking points to defend their health care policies. Choice, affordability--all these things."" Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan kicked off his pitch for a new welfare reform bill by attacking the latest example of the liberal judo flip. Last week, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that many Americans would find it easier to leave jobs, or take fewer hours, thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Republicans, whose own health care plans also tried to design ""portable"" health care plans untethered to employers, pronounced that Obamacare would kill 2.5 million jobs and create 2.5 million loafers. ""We crossed a line last week,"" said Jordan. ""We now have one of the two major parties in this country saying that less work and more welfare is part of the Democrat platform."" He shook his head. ""Did you hear what Nancy Pelosi said about job lock? What Harry Reid said about job lock?"" But hadn't Republicans also worried about ""job lock""? Asking that missed the point, said Rep. Tom Price. ""The Democrats came up with this job lock argument after they figured out how they were going to respond to the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs being lost because of Obamacare."" Jordan pointed to the work of a university of Chicago economist, Carey Mulligan, whom conservatives have been crediting with the lost-work insight. The ""job lock"" solution allowed by Obamacare was the work of subsidies and meddling. It would have to be undone, like the rest of the law, in a full repeal bill. ""The CBO report was pretty specific--it was about a disincentive to work, in general, because of and directly attributable to Obamacare,"" said Jordan. ""Professor Mulligan's work was spot on about this--it's the tax increases, it's the 40-hour work week, it's a host of other things that contribute to the general point Mulligan was making."" Anyway, that was a discussion for later--after the 2014 midterms, after the Obamacare backlash helped Republicans win at least six Senate seats. At Heritage, the new detente with congressional Republicans was all about new ideas, a mandate for 2015 or 2017. Long after Cruz and Jordan and most reporters were gone, Utah Sen. Mike Lee took the podium to talk about conservative reform in higher education. ""The conservative movement really is at its best,"" said Lee, ""when it's all about ideas."""

20	20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/02/gay_rights_debt_ceiling_and_immigration_reform_three_political_questions.html	"As the White House prepares to host French President Francois Hollande for a rare state dinner on Tuesday, here are three questions to start the week: 1. Where do gay rights rank among President Obama's priorities? Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the federal government will soon treat married same-sex couples the same as heterosexual couples when they file for bankruptcy, testify in court, or visit family in prison. Now the question is whether the president will take the next step in his support of equality, issuing an executive order that would ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity among federal contractors. After all, he just increased the minimum wage for federal contractors by executive fiat. Why not do the same thing here? With the minimum wage, the administration had to wedge its policy within the statutory limits of executive authority. An administration aide says that's not the impediment in this case. The president has the authority, he'd just prefer that the House move on the issue by passing the Employee Nondiscrimination Act, which has already passed the Senate. If they don't, the president might act. But where does this rank among his other policy priorities? That will determine how the president may want to sequence the move among all the other executive actions his administration will take. Some, like the EPA restricting emissions on power plants, will be politically volatile, increasing the heat he will take for exceeding his executive authority. Is the president willing to have a big fight over the legality of changing the discrimination provision while he is preparing for other big fights? Or does he want to make the announcement later in the election cycle, using the lack of congressional action by Republicans to remind Democrats why they should turn out on Election Day for members of their party? 2. Did Boehner's ""hot stove"" theory work? The question isn't whether Congress will vote to raise the debt ceiling but how. In days gone by, conservatives would have used the vote to strong-arm concessions from the president. In 2011, the House exacted more than $2.4 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years. But since that high-water mark Republicans have been less effective getting their pound of flesh. The president refuses to negotiate and Republican leaders don't want to risk default for fear of getting the blame for wrecking the economy. A CNN/ORC International poll released Feb. 3 found that 54 percent of Americans would blame Republicans if the debt ceiling isn't raised, while 29 percent would blame the president. Business leaders are warning that even approaching the limit will rattle the already jittery economy. Even those in the GOP conference who normally agitate are on board. ""I do not want to get into a cataclysmic fight,"" says Idaho Rep. Raul Labrador. Michele Bachmann said something similar. This retreat is also a validation of Boehner's leadership. In the fall, conservatives pushed the House Speaker into a confrontation that led to the government shutdown. At the time, Boehner believed in the ""hot stove"" theory. If conservatives were allowed to follow their plan, they would take the blame for shuttering the government and that would discourage them from bootless brinkmanship in the future. It's worked. Since the government shutdown, Republicans have voted for a debt ceiling increase, a budget agreement, and an omnibus appropriations bill without much fuss. In the past, all three could have been vehicles for showdowns. So will Republicans simply vote to raise the debt limit and move on or will they try to win something for their side from the exercise? Efforts to use the vote to force the president to approve construction of the Keystone pipeline and change provisions in the Affordable Care Act have been shelved. There is some talk about trying to find popular measures that will pressure Democrats--such as restoring recently trimmed veterans' pension benefits or stopping the mandatory cuts to Medicare doctors--but Democrats say they don't like the way Republicans want to pay for those measures. Who will be under greater pressure? Democrats resisting Republican efforts to sign on to a couple popular measures or Republicans still trying to avoid being pinned as the reason Washington doesn't work? 3. Did Sen. Chuck Schumer call Boehner's bluff? House Speaker John Boehner said his conference couldn't move forward on immigration reform because they didn't trust the president. (We assessed that claim, and the future of immigration reform, here if you'd like to read it.) Sen. Schumer responded on Meet the Press. OK, said the New York senator, we'll just delay the implementation of the bill until after President Obama is out of office. He called Boehner's bluff by exposing the speaker's comment for what it is--a fig leaf that tries to hide the biggest impediment to reform, which is his party's own disagreement about how to proceed. (On immigration, the trust hurdle isn't just about not trusting Obama; it's about not trusting anyone to keep the promise of tougher border security in exchange for accommodating those already in the United States illegally.) But how does Schumer's bluff call play out? Does it eviscerate Boehner's claim and expose Republicans as not really wanting to do anything serious on immigration? Or, by pretending to treat it seriously, does it give Republicans another opportunity to talk about their lack of trust in the president? And which discussion helps more in an election year? Are there more voters angry about their lack of trust in the president than there are voters angry the GOP won't move on immigration? And, if immigration reform is delayed, does the GOP really want to have a bloody immigration fight in 2015 when its candidates are jockeying for president?"

21	21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/02/immigration_reform_is_dead_in_2014_why_house_speaker_john_boehner_is_right.html	"In the famous scene from Monty Python's Holy Grail, a man tries to convince an undertaker with a cart full of bodies that the old man he is carrying on his shoulder is dead. The alleged corpse protests, ""I'm not dead yet."" They debate the point. ""I don't want to go on the cart,"" says the old man. ""Don't be such a baby,"" says his captor. Twice people referenced this scene as I called around looking for the latest on immigration reform. It was not dead yet, various people suggested, even though House Speaker John Boehner just announced that progress was stalled because Republican members didn't trust the president. If that was the hurdle, it was the equivalent of idling the hearse, because trust is not likely to bloom afresh in the bosom of House Republicans in an election year on this volatile topic. But immigration reform backers were not taking this dark view. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Boehner's remarks were merely a sign that the process will take time. Sen. Chuck Schumer was not discouraged either. ""I think Boehner has tried,"" said Simon Rosenberg, president of the New Democrat Network, and a longtime advocate of immigration reform. ""We are as close as we've ever been. I haven't given up."" Boehner's remarks were interpreted as an attempt to settle down his bifurcated and spiky conference. Last week House Republican leaders put forward vague principles that would guide immigration reform. Conservatives didn't like them, even in their vague, amorphous state. Boehner's remarks were an effort to lower the boil by showing he wasn't rushing to a deal. He was also sending a signal to the business groups, evangelical leaders, and agricultural interests who are lobbying Republicans to support reform: Right now the votes are not there and getting them will be hard. (How hard? About as easy as convincing Republicans to trust the president.) Democrats also could empathize. They recognize that Boehner has a sequencing problem. He is going to irritate conservatives soon enough by agreeing to a debt limit increase which won't extract sufficient concessions from the president. He has to get that skirmish out of the way first before the immigration fight. It's a little surprising to hear Democrats giving the House speaker room to maneuver rather than rushing to denounce him. It is actually a sign of trust that they think he really does want to pass some form of immigration reform. It's also a recognition that little else would do much good. President Obama has not made a showy and sustained public push for reform, which Republicans working the issue say has been helpful, on the theory that when the president touches an issue, Republicans shy away from it, regardless of the merits. If anything is going to happen on reform, Boehner is going to have to shepherd it, so beating up on him isn't going to help matters. Immigration reform advocates are hoping that the lobbying groups and the GOP's fears of permanently alienating Latinos will keep the pressure on for action. Those in the Republican Party who believe that improving relations with the Latino community is necessary for the GOP's survival worry that putting off immigration reform until next year will be too late. The presidential jockeying will begin in early 2015, which will force the conversation to the right as the party's most public voices compete for its most conservative activists who are cool to sweeping reform. Rosenberg, of the New Democrat Network, also warns Republicans that by failing to act after having gotten a bipartisan bill through the Senate, they won't simply be missing an opportunity to court Latinos, they will be doing further damage to an already battered brand. So despite the public signs of gloom from Boehner, a case can be made for hope. That's always nice. But in the Monty Python scene, the moral is not that hope wins out in the end, but that a stronger determined force typically triumphs. ""I feel happy,"" sings the old man, trying to prove his vitality. Just as he does, the mortician dispatches him with a club, sending him to his reward and ending the debate. This is the inevitable truth of immigration reform. The forces trying to kill this reform are stronger than those trying to keep it alive. People working this issue see it this way: The House Republican conference can be divided into thirds. In this view, one third will never vote for any immigration reform that could actually be signed into law, one third would like to get an immigration bill, and one third is highly reluctant either because they lack trust or think it is politically dumb. Here is a key point: The conservative activists and grassroots groups who can punish members who vote for a bad immigration bill are stronger than the forces that are pushing for passage of the immigration bill. This is the shorthand Republicans use to explain the political balance of power. ""The Chamber [of Commerce] and downtown [lobbyists] want it,"" says one GOP leadership aide, ""but they're not going to primary anyone."" Absent the clarifying force of an outside group putting a lot of money or enthusiasm behind a challenger, Republicans in individual districts don't face pressure from minority voters. There are 108 majority-minority districts and Republicans only hold nine of them. Of the 24 House Republicans who represent a district where the Latino population is 25 percent or higher, only a handful are vulnerable and could therefore be affected by a bold move on this issue that would affect voter opinions. As Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg points out in a recent memo, only 34 percent of Republicans favored a way to accommodate undocumented workers in a recent CNN poll. Only 29 percent of Tea Party supporters did. Republicans need base voters in nonpresidential years and the GOP base is more likely to be motivated by what they see as a capitulation on immigration than the Democratic base is likely to be motivated by a lack of action. Given this political landscape, why would Republicans want to have a fight over legislation that will divide their party, especially when they could spend their time attacking Democrats over Obamacare? It won't just be the policy that will divide Republicans. Any deal would require some kind of arrangement with President Obama. That's where the trust comes in. The substantive reason Republicans cite is that they don't think Obama will enforce the stricter border security that would be a prerequisite for any deal that would allow some kind of permanent status for undocumented workers. Democrats point out that Obama has quite a strong deportation record and that he'll be out of office when the enforcement would take place. But facts are beside the point. The lack of trust in Obama is a toxic mix of anger over Benghazi, the IRS, and the president's shifting promises on health care. A Republican politician is very nervous about making any deal that can be characterized as requiring faith in Obama. That would irritate their most ardent constituents and the next thing they know, they might find themselves arguing for their political life."

22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/02/charlie_crist_memoir_the_party_s_over_the_former_florida_governor_s_book.html	"The challenge facing Charlie Crist, Florida's once-and-maybe-future governor, was that which confronts so many struggling authors of romance novels. How do you describe a hug? How do you cram all the intimacy of human skin, breath, and contact into a couple of words in a Garamond font. How do you not end up polishing a Bad Sex Award? Crist came up with something, but it's not pleasant. In The Party's Over, his unimaginatively titled memoir of a political life cut short by the Tea Party movement, Crist returns again and again to his February 2009 appearance with President Obama. ""As he and I made our way through the crowd toward the stage,"" Crist writes, ""how could anyone not feel the power of this man?"" When they reach the podium, Crist gave a short speech about budgets and infrastructure that was, he reminds us, interrupted frequently by applause. Then came the moment. ""The new president leaned forward,"" Crist writes, ""and gave me a hug. Reach. Pull. Release. As hugs go, it wasn't anything special. It was over in a second--less than that. It was the kind of hug that says, 'Hey, good to see you, man. Thanks for being here.' It was the kind of hug I'd exchanged with thousands of thousands and Floridians over the years ... reach, pull, release--just like that."" After the shudder fades, the reader at least understands where Crist is coming from. In 2009, a few months after Obama had carried his state, Crist was one of the only Republican governors willing to take strings-attached stimulus money and denounce anyone who wouldn't. One of the first rallies of the nascent Tea Party movement took place outside the Crist-Obama rally. Marco Rubio created a fundraising site consisting entirely of the ""hug"" photo. Conservatives heckled Crist, dared him to ""hug Obama again."" When Texas Rep. Steve Stockman's primary campaign against Sen. John Cornyn lacked a photo of the senator with Obama, it just Photoshopped Cornyn's head onto Crist's. Anyone who followed Crist's doomed Senate campaign remembers how he scrambled to recover. For as long as he thought he could beat Rubio, he downplayed the ""hug"" and why it happened. In November 2009, he insisted to CNN that he did not actually ""endorse"" the stimulus. ""I didn't even have a vote on the darned thing,"" he explained, ""but I understood that it was going to pass and I wanted to be able to utilize it for the benefit of my fellow Floridians."" That quote doesn't surface in The Party's Over, and it's not because Crist is loath to quote himself. In one scene, months after the hug, he recalls how he told off his fellow Republican governors at a dinner with the White House, defending his appearance with Obama. (Strangely, he doesn't name any of the governors who criticized Obama to his face and he says he was tired of ""this shit,"" but assures the reader that he ""didn't use the expletive."") ""I went there because I was raised by my mother and father and taught how to behave,"" he tells his peers. ""We ought to be treating each other as we're told in the Bible--'do unto others.' "" Crist reports that some colleagues did not, for some reason, enjoy being lectured from the scripture. But White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett thanked him personally for speaking the truth. ""As Valerie spoke,"" Crist writes, ""I could see tears were running down her cheeks."" The conversions of Charlie Crist, from Republican to independent to Democrat, make up one of the least inspiring tales in modern politics. To take it seriously is to admit you're the sort of person who takes Scientology stress tests and supplies credit card info to anyone who claims to need help from Nigeria. Crist is deeply affable, and handsome in a bottle-tan way. ""The only thing that was weird about writing this book with him,"" Crist's co-author Ellis Henican told me, ""was that he looked like me if my mother had dumped my father and dated George Hamilton."" Crist enjoys being popular. He enjoys winning elections, too. When he won his first state Senate race he ""danced all night [to] the Sister Sledge song 'We are Family,'"" even though he really doesn't ""like dancing at all."" He enjoys high poll numbers. He enjoys praise, the kind he got after siding with Democrats against an anti-abortion bill on the grounds that he believed in ""individual rights."" He can remember exactly what an administrative assistant told him after that: ""Great vote, boss."" This book exists because Crist remains fairly popular, and the Republican who replaced him, conservative hospital tycoon Rick Scott, does not. Democrats have celebrated Crist's slow embrace of their party, grudgingly, even as Florida's Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson leaves open the possibility that he'll run if Crist screws up. But that's not in his nature. In 2009, even his enemies attributed Crist's embrace of the stimulus as an odd lapse from a politician who can usually figure out where the public's going to be. When he stayed in the 2010 Senate race as an independent, Crist cut the figure that rich know-nothings call for in every election--he was for working together. Other readers of this memoir, seeking insight into the man who might again rule a megastate, have remarked at how little self-awareness he shows or how much he talks in campaign English. Did the Senate race turn on any issues, any decisions of Crist's? We aren't told, though we learn that Crist turned against a teacher tenure bill backed by conservatives because ""every day, individual teachers were writing me and calling with personal appeals"" to veto it. We assume that they were right, especially after Crist's political mentor Connie Mack calls him and threatens to resign as a campaign co-chair if Crist vetos. ""It kind of broke my heart that he would feel so strongly about this one issue that he would resign from my campaign,"" writes Crist. ""Sometimes, there are pressures beyond our understanding. I don't know what brought that to bear."" How you read that sentence depends on whether or not you, personally, are Charlie Crist. Mack was a former U.S. senator, making embarrassing amounts of money at a lobbying firm that didn't actually work on education policy. What was in it for him? Maybe nothing was in it for him. Crist, who shows no traces of a guiding ideology, thinks of it like a sort of infection or pod-people curse. But what sort of politics do you have without it? There's a helpful example from the end of the book and the end of Crist's time in office. ""I convinced my fellow members of the Clemency Board to grant a posthumous pardon to rocker Jim Morrison,"" writes Crist. ""That may not rank as a major governmental achievement. But it was long overdue."""	Charlie Crist Has No Ideology Beyond His Hope That People Like Him	['Cornyn', 'Rubio', 'Nelson', 'Obama']	[]
23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/02/republicans_are_favoring_going_easy_on_drug_offenders_the_young_gop_leaders.html	"Rand Paul had been talking for 20 minutes, strumming all the familiar chords. He was the gala keynoter for the annual American Principles Project, a 5-year-old social conservative group best known recently for running TV ads against Liz Cheney. (The ads, funded by APP's political arm, attacked Cheney's advocacy for ""government benefits for gay couples."") Paul had criticized the New York Times, defended the now-lapsed cuts of sequestration, and warned that a ""Republican-lite"" party was doomed to lose. Standard stuff. So he started challenging the crowd. ""As Christians, we believe in forgiveness,"" said Paul. ""I think the criminal justice system should have some element of forgiveness."" There are, sure, human terrors who need to be locked up. ""But there are also people who make youthful mistakes who I believe deserve a second chance. In my state, you never vote again if you're convicted of a felony. But a felony could be growing marijuana plants in college. Friend of mine's brother did 30 years ago. He has an MBA. But he can't vote, can't own a gun, and he's a house-painter with an MBA, because he has to check a box saying he's a convicted felon."" Paul's audience, consisting of social conservatives, congressional candidates, and radio hosts, listened or nodded along. ""These are ideas not many Republicans have talked about before,"" Paul said. ""I think if we talk about these ideas, we take them to the minority community, often the African-American and sometimes the Hispanic community--3 out of 4 people in prison are black and brown! But if you look at surveys on who uses drugs, whites and blacks and Hispanic use at about the same rate. You don't have as good an attorney if you don't have money. Some of the prosecution has tended to go where it's easier to prosecute people."" The crowd stayed with him. ""I think these are things we should look at. I'm not talking about legalization. I'm talking about making the criminal justice system fair and giving people a second chance if they served their time,"" Paul said. That line earned a long burst of applause. Paul was in no danger of losing this crowd. Conservatives were ready to talk about lighter sentences for some criminals and for the restoration of felons' rights. Just one week earlier, the Senate Judiciary Committee had approved the Smarter Sentencing Act, co-sponsored by Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin and Utah Sen. Mike Lee. If signed by the president, it would slash the 30-year-old mandatory minimums for drug crimes. Ten-year sentences would become five-year sentences. Five-year sentences would shrink to two years. Every Democrat had voted ""aye""--as had three of the committee's eight Republicans. The bill isn't as far-reaching as Paul's own Justice Safety Valve bill, but it's moving, and there's already companion legislation waiting in the House. The most partisan Congress in anybody's memory may actually come together to go easier on nonviolent drug offenders. Both parties are raring for it. In a subtle kind of way, they're racing to take credit for it, too. In 2010, President Obama signed the Fair Sentencing Act into law, shrinking the disparity between crack and cocaine sentences from 100-1 to 18-1. In 2013, the re-elected Obama administration started talking more openly about sentencing reform. ""The war on drugs is now 30, 40 years old,"" Attorney General Eric Holder told NPR last year. ""There have been a lot of unintended consequences. There's been a decimation of certain communities, in particular communities of color."" Holder, who's been officially censured by the Republican House of Representatives, suffered no talk radio/outrage machine/political backlash for his message. The U.S. Sentencing Commission, which is being heavily lobbied to change standards, now consists mostly of Obama appointees. Even the conservative appointees like William H. Pryor Jr., whose judicial nomination was filibustered by Democrats for two years, are advocates for reform. This is more than a trend. This is a reversal of a trend that helped create the modern Republican Party. After bottoming out in the 1964 election, Republicans surged back in 1966 and won the presidency in 1968. They cracked the old Democratic coalition, in part because rising crime rates and visions of urban riots sent voters sprinting away from liberalism. ""In recent years,"" said Richard Nixon in a 1968 campaign ad, ""crime in this country has grown nine times as fast as population. At the current rate, the crimes of violence in America will double by 1972."" As he talked, images of dead bodies, guns, and wild-eyed protesters played over a soundtrack of atonal horn blasts and drumbeats. For three more decades, Republicans could win tight elections by capitalizing on the fear of crime. Democrats met them where they could, to neutralize the issue, because to be called ""soft on crime"" was to be exiled with Michael Dukakis. As recently as 2012, a pro-Mitt Romney super PAC could dunk on Rick Santorum by warning voters that the senator ""voted to let convicted felons vote."" But it's one issue at a time, and sentencing reform is getting a look before felon vote restoration does. Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, one of the Judiciary Committee members who voted for the sentencing reform bill, acknowledged that the GOP had long been the ""law and order"" party. ""But we've also been the rational party,"" he said. ""We've been the party of fiscal discipline. It's tough to justify some of these incarcerations and the cost. I understand the argument that it gives law enforcement another card to play, plea bargains--I understand that. But we've gone too far."" In the Judiciary Committee, the average age of the Republicans who voted for reform--Sens. Ted Cruz, Jeff Flake, and Mike Lee--was 45. The average age of the Republicans who voted no--Sens. John Cornyn, Lindsey Graham, Chuck Grassley, Orrin Hatch, and Jeff Sessions--was 69. The elder Republicans didn't want to patronize the new class and didn't doubt that, in Sessions's words, ""there are some areas where we could reduce the length of incarceration without adversely impacting crime rates."" But they remembered the bad old days, and the young guys didn't. ""They don't remember how bad crime was in the 1970s, when people were terrorized and murders were three times what they are today,"" said Sessions. ""There's a libertarian concern that the government is incarcerating too many Americans. They don't think too much of that."" They don't, but they're not naive. Idaho Rep. Raul Labrador, age 46, sponsored the House companion to the Durbin-Lee reform bill. He was an immigration lawyer before he entered politics. ""I spent 15 years working in the criminal defense business and seeing people, nonviolent offenders, going to prison,"" he explained. ""Then, when I was in the state legislature, I was seeing these budgets continue to grow. In federal court, you can know a drug dealer, and just the fact that you knew he was about to make a deal, you'd be charged with the entire conspiracy. You'd have a person who was a low-level offender who really had no participation in the conspiracy, and he'd be charged with everything the top trafficker was charged with. And I don't think that's right. Our Founding Fathers wanted to make it difficult for people to be prosecuted."" And here's one of the paradoxes of the new Republican divide. The older class, hewing to law and order, points to the nightmares of the 1970s and 1980s. This isn't a theoretical discussion. It's about undoing minimums and social norms that have, sure, generated some awful stories but have played at least some role in plunging crime rates. ""I think the president made a big mistake when he spoke cavalierly about drug use,"" said Sessions. ""There's a national effort that saw drug use by high school seniors go from over 50 percent to under 25 percent. The more we talk about it, the more it goes on television, the more it goes on jokesters' programs, you're going to see young people use drugs more."" The new Republicans, people like Paul, have their own anecdotes, about people their own age--about themselves. Then they skip past the law-and-order era, 200 years back, to the intent of the founders. Here is a cause whose time should have come many, many years ago."

24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/02/the_cbo_report_and_obamacare_the_law_s_uncertainty_is_the_aca_s_biggest.html	"When you get an envelope from your insurance company, it can contain a variety of surprises. Sometimes a check falls out. The claim was paid quickly--and they covered more than you expected. This is rare. More often you open the envelope and unfurl a multipage form that reads ""this is not a check and isn't likely to be a check any time soon."" That isn't the literal wording, but it's the reasonable conclusion you reach after trying to parse the jargon, following the code at the bottom of the page, and reading the grayed out boilerplate on the back of the letter. Or, you get a notice from your insurance company telling you that your coverage is going to change. You don't know exactly what that means, but you're pretty sure that it won't lead to more happy surprises in the future. These types of experiences have their analogue in the life of the Affordable Care Act. As it has come into being, the legislation has delivered both good and bad surprises. Recently the big surprises have been bad. The website didn't work, portions of the law had to be delayed, people who were promised they could keep their coverage couldn't, and there have been headaches for those who have signed up that have continued beyond the website. On Tuesday the administration had to manage another surprise when the Congressional Budget Office predicted the Affordable Care Act would have a ""substantially larger"" impact on the labor market than it had previously expected: The law would reduce the workforce in 2021 by the equivalent of 2.3 million full-time workers, three times more than the 800,000 originally anticipated. Debate immediately raged over what that number really meant. It didn't mean that 2.3 million jobs were being lost, which is how ACA opponents framed the news. The CBO said this explicitly and Republican Budget Chairman Paul Ryan was clear to make this case too at his hearing with the CBO director Wednesday. The law would lead to a reduction in hours, which would come from people choosing not to work. So one parent in a couple could stop working so hard to get health insurance, replacing those hours spent at the office with time at home with the kids. Older workers who risk their health to keep working to get benefits could stop. But not all of the decisions will be voluntary. People who want to work more won't work because as they earn more, their subsidy will decrease, creating a tax. That is a natural result of any social policy where benefits taper off as wages increase. The news ratified the longstanding claims by opponents of the ACA that the law would change the incentives for work--in this case trading work for a new entitlement. The Congressional Budget Office did not try to parse out exactly how many of the fewer hours will be a choice people will be happy about and how many will be a choice forced on them. As the report says, ""The CBO's estimate of the ACA's impact on labor markets is subject to substantial uncertainty, which arises in part because many of the ACA's provisions have never been implemented on such a broad scale and in part because available estimates of many key responses vary considerably."" In other words: Big surprises are coming. Regardless of where you come down on the specifics of the report--will it mean job losses or greater flexibility--the report was a reminder that when you unleash a law that affects this much of the economy, it creates a lot of uncertainty. In this specific instance, the CBO says the uncertainty described in its report will fall on a lot of lower-income people who might very well be happy they have insurance for the first time in their lives. They may also be healthier people--the report is predicting behavior several years from now--since these people will have been covered for a few years and perhaps taken advantage of preventive care. So as a political matter, the people directly affected by the policy may reward the politicians who brought it to them. But what about the people not necessarily affected by the law but worried about the uncertainty? This group involves those with high incomes who won't receive subsidies or who already have policies. They won't be affected by the subsidies that play the largest role in the changes the CBO is predicting, but that may not reduce their political nervousness. These voters are a problem today for the reason they always have been: They see the ACA not as an engine of great new benefits but as an unpredictable force that could disrupt the coverage that they have. The CBO report--and the reaction to it--reanimates their underlying fear about the law: When the government initiates huge changes, it creates tremors that may affect me even though I was promised they wouldn't. This is the fix for Democrats running for re-election during the Affordable Care Act rollout. They can find information in the CBO report that helps their case, like the fact that the law has led to no increase in part-time work as detractors have prophesied or that the provision Republicans bash as an ""insurance company bailout"" actually brings in money, but they also have to address every new round of jitters, which cannot simply be dismissed as the creation of partisan Republicans. One sensible approach might be to wait until the law is implemented and stop jumping at the smallest hints about what the future might hold. Or we could at least wait for insurance companies to publish their new premium costs in May. Then we'll know if the law is causing prices to increase. Or we could wait until the fall to see how many more people are now insured. Then we can use that data to make a claim about whether the whole thing was worth it. That case for patience is one that administration advisers are making, but they are on shaky ground since they have been projecting their own sense of false certainty about the future, too. After a string of bad ACA surprises, administration officials started touting a good surprise: Health care costs have been declining because of the law, they say. A check may not have fallen out of your last envelope, but the check is in the mail ... really. The problem with this nice surprise is that it requires a mix of optimism and creative thinking. It's clear that health care expenditures have slowed, but a 2013 Kaiser study said the majority of the reduction in health spending came from the recession, not the ACA. Medicare actuaries reached the same conclusion: ""There is no discernible impact of the [ACA] legislation on aggregate health spending trends."" The administration's case, which can be found here, relies on a different way of measuring health care costs. If the administration is going to make a case about the future of health care costs based on evanescent evidence, then it can't complain about people who see doom in these new CBO numbers. The best the administration can argue is that we don't know what the future holds, but that's not likely to calm people's jitters about what might appear in tomorrow's envelope."

He asked his wife, Theresa, if she wanted to join him in reliving Mitt Romney's six-year quest for the presidency. ""She said, 'Of course not,' "" remembers Smith. ""So I started watching it. I got to the part where Romney was being made up, and he said 'Careful, don't break it!' I turned to my wife and said, 'Baby, you should watch this--he's kind of funny!' And she said, 'Fuck no.' "" Theresa Smith was missing out on an incredibly meta night of movie-watching. Jeff Smith, who's now an urban policy professor at the New School in New York, used to be a rising star of Missouri politics. In 2004, he ran for Congress and let a documentary crew film his narrow--much, much closer than expected--loss in the primary to a member of the Carnahan dynasty. The result was the campaign documentary Can Mr. Smith Get to Washington Anymore?, an instant genre classic that probably helped Smith win a state Senate seat in 2006. ""I had my organizers signing up volunteers when moviegoers would come out of the theaters in St. Louis,"" says Smith. ""As soon as I was sworn into the Senate, I was asked to join the party campaign committee, and that had to be because they knew about the movie and figured I could raise money."" Three years later, Smith was in federal prison. During that heroic 2004 campaign, he'd filed a false affidavit about an independent group that sent out helpful mailers. Smith spent 366 days in jail, but he bounced back quickly. His movie-won celebrity did not hurt. ""In prison, I got letters from someone every week, pretty much, from someone who just watched the movie,"" he says. ""I still get really, really heartwarming notes from strangers. I Skype into 30-40 classes a year of political science professors who teach the movie."" An honest documentary can turn any politician into an icon, as long as he doesn't act like a monster. This is what Mitt Romney's been learning since the rollout of Mitt--a campaign that easily eclipses that of the Netflix-owned The Square, which is nominated for an Oscar. Romney appeared at his film's premiere at Sundance, basking in possibly the kindest coverage he'd gotten since he ran the 2002 Winter Olympics. ""Not only did Mr. Romney's team often fail to convey the full depth of its candidate,"" wrote the New York Times Romney correspondent Ashley Parker, ""but he himself could not seem to transcend the barrier between his public and private personas."" Romney is suddenly appearing on cool late-night talk shows and at the Super Bowl. He is getting asked whether he'd run for president again. Hey, he is even leading the polls in New Hampshire. (For the record, his answer: ""Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no."") From cycle to cycle, presidential campaigns brainstorm new ways to limit access for the media while concocting an appearance of access. The documentary, for all its risks, is a perfect way to do that. Filmmakers need a narrative. The rush of a campaign, the punishing, fatiguing task of flogging oneself to voter after voter, is a ready-made hero's journey. That's been true since Robert Drew tagged along with John F. Kennedy's campaign in the 1960 Democratic primary. It was just as true for Barack Obama, who let a crew film the eventual HBO documentary By the People, as it was for Romney. It's even truer for a campaign loser. Romney won't run again, but Rick Santorum might, and Santorum's guerilla war to win the Iowa caucuses is the main drama of the helpfully titled 2013 documentary Caucus. It's not as light on policy talk as Mitt is, but it's close. There's one late scene where a confused woman insists that Mexicans are taking America's trucking jobs and Santorum struggles for a way to be disgusted without alienating her, but there's nothing about, say, Herman Cain's regressive tax plan or the contemporary debt limit quagmire that drove the entire campaign far to the right. None of that. The story of Caucus is that the process of running for president is completely degrading, but Rick Santorum survived it. It's Rocky recast and set at a series of suburban Pizza Ranches. Are there 30 seconds of Santorum talking about the wrongness of legal gay marriage and abortion? Then they're going to be matched by 60 seconds of him driving an audience to tears with the story of his stillborn son Gabriel and his disabled daughter Bella. ""People say, Rick--you're so extreme!"" says Santorum after a voter asks about Gabriel. ""You want to value all human life!"" By that point, we're nodding along with his sarcasm. Director A.J. Schnack did not set out to lionize Santorum. ""We thought it would be an interesting B-storyline of this guy who does everything he can and comes in last place,"" Schnack told Jon Ward last year. The director showed up in Iowa, he covered the candidates, and one of them just so happened to make hundreds of campaign stops. ""Quite frankly,"" says 2012 Santorum communications director Hogan Gidley, ""they were the only cameras that showed up for the first year."" Santorum's late surge changed the narrative. When he told a crowd at the Iowa State Fair that the media was ignoring his campaign--""What's the national media have against a guy who's beaten three Democratic incumbents in a swing state?""--it sounded weak and bitter. At the front of this documentary, it's a moment of huh-look-at-that foreshadowing. (Santorum beat two, not three, incumbents and lost his Senate seat in 2006.) The filmmakers are there when Santorum learns that he's surged in the final Des Moines Register poll and whispers, ""It's real."" Maybe it's the raw emotion, maybe it's the natural and human desire to watch Mitt Romney spend a bunch of money and lose, but in that moment, the viewer is rooting for Santorum. ""If you're not a frontrunner and there isn't a running narrative already in place, things like that can produce a positive narrative,"" says Gidley. ""The more you hang out with Rick, the more likable he became. You know, after the movie started playing, the old campaign team joked about it--we said we need to get about 80,000 copies of it and send it to everybody in Iowa. Hey, voters, look! He's a good dude."" Would that work? The narrative of a documentary like Caucus or Mitt ends with a losing candidate. It's hard to hate a loser, hard to be cynical about how he presents himself onscreen. When he's a candidate, though--well, then he's a vessel for the beliefs of a particular party or wing of a party. It's harder to fool voters into liking the guy because they saw him being ""real."" But it's been tried. When Romney ran in 2008, actually, the campaign issued occasional real-video updates of his family being ridiculous. Before Super Tuesday, voters got to see Matt Romney prank-call his dad using a soundboard of Arnold Schwarzenegger clips. ""I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions,"" said the voice of the California governor, ""and I want to have them answered immediately."" Romney's deadpan confusion, packaged and distributed by the campaign, became a kind of news. So did many of Gov. Chris Christie's town hall meetings, organized and filmed by his communications team--they're the reason he became a national star so quickly. Christie was far more open to the press than the average presidential campaign, but the inevitable trend of all coverage is a diminution in the role of the press and more controlled ""transparency"" from the candidate/campaign/president. Tomorrow's campaigns really should let in the documentary makers and put the footage out themselves. The worst that could happen is that the candidate becomes an icon."

26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/02/democratic_super_pacs_trounce_gop_rivals_republicans_intraparty_rivals_may.html	"Democrats are embracing super PACs--the independent political money groups they once derided--and are easily outpacing Republicans in the race for cash, according to the most recent campaign finance filings. In 2013, the three highest-profile Democratic super PACs focused on congressional elections collectively raised more than $22 million--about four times more than their five mainstream GOP counterparts, according to a Center for Public Integrity analysis of new filings submitted to the Federal Election Commission. Republicans, meanwhile, are again facing an intraparty struggle as Tea Party-affiliated super PACs take aim at mainstream Republicans in primary battles. Super PACs, which roared to life after the U.S. Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision, differ from campaign committees and traditional political action committees because they can raise unlimited amounts of money from individuals, unions, and corporations. Liberals blasted the Citizens United decision and have scoffed at the groups it spawned. Still, super PACs are key to the Democrats' plans for this year's congressional elections. Senate in play The Senate Majority PAC, which aims to help Democrats retain control of Congress' upper chamber, raised $8.6 million in 2013, and the House Majority PAC raised $7.8 million. Additionally, the Democratic-aligned American Bridge 21st Century super PAC--which specializes in opposition research, the type of information that often makes it into campaign ads as segments of damning video or audio--raised $5.9 million. ""Senate Majority PAC is necessary because we have to fight back against the Koch brothers and other conservative outside groups who are flooding millions of dollars into races trying to buy the Senate,"" said spokesman Ty Matsdorf. ""We can't fight with one arm tied behind our back."" Billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch have spent millions backing conservative causes--the specter of their involvement this year has become an effective fundraising tool for the Democrats. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, ranked as Senate Majority PAC's biggest backer last year, giving $2.5 million, while hedge fund executive Donald Sussman--the husband of Maine Rep. Chellie Pingree--was top donor to the House Majority PAC, at $850,000. Liberal billionaire George Soros, meanwhile, contributed $500,000 to American Bridge in December, earning him the top spot among that group's 2013 donors. Several labor unions also pumped sizeable sums into the three groups' coffers. While Democratic-aligned groups are winning the fundraising race as of now, deep-pocketed donors can shift the scales overnight should they choose to pour new money into either super PACs or politically active nonprofits, the favored vehicles of the Kochs. Poor showing for GOP American Crossroads and the Conservative Victory Project, two super PACs connected to GOP strategist Karl Rove, each reported comparatively paltry receipts in 2013. American Crossroads, which was the top-spending super PAC during the 2010 midterm election, raised about $3.6 million in 2013. And the Conservative Victory Project raised just $16,500. Two other GOP-aligned super PACs focused on helping the party retain control of the House--the Congressional Leadership Fund and the YG Action Fund--raised $1.1 million and $344,000, respectively. And a recently launched super PAC called America Rising, which specializes in opposition research, much like the Democrats' American Bridge, raised about $478,000. One of its top donors was Restore Our Future, the super PAC that attempted to boost Republican Mitt Romney during the 2012 presidential race, that gave it $100,000. Texas billionaire Harold Simmons, who died in December, ranked as the top giver to the Congressional Leadership Fund, at $200,000. His company, Contran Corp., ranked as the No. 1 donor to American Crossroads last year, having contributed $1 million. American Crossroads spokesman Jonathan Collegio vowed that his group would ""make a big impact in the 2014 elections"" and help ""win a GOP majority in the Senate and help expand the majority in the House."" First, though, the GOP establishment must survive an intraparty fight, where conservative hardliners--armed with their own super PACs and nonprofits--are pushing Republican candidates rightward and even angling for their preferred candidates to triumph over incumbents they dislike. Groups such as the Club for Growth and Senate Conservatives Fund--which have tapped into the energy and pocketbooks of Tea Party and anti-tax activists--are looking to replace GOP senators who they deem insufficiently conservative. Republicans vs. Republicans The potential targets include Mississippi Sen. Thad Cochran, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Club for Growth President Chris Chocola, a former Republican congressman from Indiana, has made it clear that his group is not afraid to go after incumbents. Club for Growth's political machine, he said last year, ""helps elect candidates who support limited government and free markets. Unfortunately, the two goals coincide less often than the Republican establishment cares to admit."" The sentiment has also been echoed by Jim DeMint, the former South Carolina Republican senator who founded the Senate Conservatives Fund and now serves as president of the Heritage Foundation. ""We must remember that there is a distinction between the Republican Party and the conservative movement,"" DeMint declared at the 2013 Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C. ""National Republican leaders have not advanced a conservative agenda for almost 20 years."" Already, the Club for Growth's super PAC has spent more than $200,000 on ads backing Mississippi state Sen. Chris McDaniel, who is challenging Cochran. And the Senate Conservatives Fund, through its super PAC and traditional political action committee arm, has spent nearly $1 million combined on ads backing either McDaniel or Matt Bevin, the conservative businessman challenging McConnell. In 2013, the Club for Growth Action super PAC raised $2.6 million, and the Senate Conservatives Action super PAC raised $1.6 million. Wealthy home builder Bob Perry, a Texan who died in April, ranked as the top donor to Senate Conservatives Action, giving $1 million. Meanwhile, investor Virginia James of New Jersey and Illinois businessman Richard Uihlein each gave $500,000 to the Club for Growth's super PAC last year, ranking as top donors to the anti-tax group. Super PACs to ""scare off opponents"" Super PACs supporting the candidacy of a single politician have become increasingly commonplace. ""Candidate-specific super PACs can help scare off opponents or signal to opponents and potential opponents that their favored candidate will have ample funding,"" said Jessica Levinson, a professor at the Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. That phenomenon is already unfolding in Kentucky, Mississippi, and South Carolina--and a host of other states from Alaska to North Carolina. Last April, McConnell's allies launched a super PAC called Kentuckians for Strong Leadership to aid in his re-election. The group raised $2.4 million in 2013. It received large contributions from the likes of real estate mogul Donald Trump ($50,000), coal executive Joe Craft ($100,000), and Florida-based NextEra Energy, a Fortune 200 utilities company ($100,000). Graham's supporters, likewise, created a group called the West Main Street Values PAC, which raised about $130,000 in 2013, including $50,000 from GOP fundraiser and former U.S. ambassador to Belgium Sam Fox and $25,000 from the political action committee of Boeing. And in mid-January, Cochran's backers launched a super PAC called Mississippi Conservatives. That group has not yet disclosed any of its funders, but it has already spent more than $200,000 on pro-Cochran ads. Republicans are not the only ones getting in on the action. Allies of embattled Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan of North Carolina recently launched a group called Wolfheel PAC, and Sen. Mark Begich of Alaska is being backed by a super PAC called Put Alaska First. The pro-Hagan Wolfheel PAC, which registered with the FEC in early January, has not yet been required to report its funders. Put Alaska First, meanwhile, collected $287,500 last year. One of the largest donors to the pro-Begich political group was actually the Senate Majority PAC, which transferred $170,000 to Put Alaska First last year. A Washington-based fishing company headed by a Begich donor named Hae Joo ""Helena"" Park also contributed $100,000. Then there's We Are Kentucky, a super PAC that is backing Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes, who is vying for McConnell's Senate seat. It raised $260,500 since its formation in July. Two labor unions--the United Autoworkers and the plumbers and pipefitters' United Association--each pitched in $100,000. Ready for Hillary to play in midterms At least two Democratic-aligned, candidate-specific super PACs are also already making preparations for the next presidential race. The first is Ready for Hillary, which was formed a year ago. The other is Priorities USA Action, which helped President Barack Obama win a second term in the White House and now plans to aid Hillary Clinton, should she opt to run in 2016. Ready for Hillary spokesman Seth Bringman told the Center for Public Integrity that his group, which raised $4 million in 2013, will engage in races in which Clinton herself has endorsed candidates. ""We will conduct additional efforts to amplify Hillary's endorsements,"" Bringman said. ""Success in the midterm elections is vital to our party."" Peter Kauffmann, a spokesman for Priorities USA Action, meanwhile, said that his group, which still has $3 million in reserves, does not intend to be involved in the 2014 midterm elections. As Democratic and Republican groups alike look to keep increasing the size of their war chests, one thing's for certain: The proliferation of super PACs will lead to a barrage of ads this year--particularly in the Senate's battleground states. ""Residents of states with high-profile Senate races will be inundated with ads,"" said Erika Franklin Fowler, a director of the Wesleyan Media Project, which monitors political advertising. In many places, she continued, ""ads have already started."" Ben Wieder and Erin Quinn contributed to this report.

27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/01/terrorism_civil_liberty_and_security_americans_need_to_debate_homeland_security.html	"As Congress sets its agenda for hearings and legislation relating to homeland security, we can anticipate some of the issues it will address. Expect discussion about whether al-Qaida is on the run or on the rebound, new legislative initiatives on how to deal with the continuing threat in cyberspace, beefing up security on the border, and the National Security Agency's collection of metadata, to name just of few. These should be matters of great public interest, and they are. According to recent public opinion polls, 75 percent of Americans see terrorist attacks in the United States as a continuing threat, although they are close to evenly divided on whether the government can do more to stop them. But as legislators work their way through these matters, here are some fundamental issues of threat, risk, public expectation, and the protection of liberty and privacy that merit debate. What is the terrorist threat? Getting the threat right is critical. But this is an election year, so threat assessments will inevitably get tangled up with political agendas. Some want to discredit the administration's narrative of a tough and mostly successful counterterrorism campaign, while others want to claim a victory of sorts and declare an end to the war's costly diversion of attention and resources. Both sides can muster evidence to support their positions. Looking back to 2001, there has been undeniable progress, but peace is not at hand. Relentless pursuit has decimated al-Qaida's top leadership and degraded its operational capabilities--the threat of new 9/11s has been reduced. But the recent proliferation of groups across Africa and the Middle East that have taken up al-Qaida's banner cautions that it would be premature to write al-Qaida's epitaph. The dominant role played by al-Qaida's fighters in Syria's civil war and the recent takeover of Fallujah and parts of Ramadi by al-Qaida's affiliate in Iraq attest to the terrorist group's resiliency. Threat assessments must also take into account that it ain't all al-Qaida. Beyond al-Qaida there are groups that subscribe to similarly hostile Salafist ideologies. Continuing chaos in Libya, Syria's civil war, and escalating sectarian violence in Iraq and elsewhere in the region will undoubtedly create new terrorist adversaries. Intelligence officials worry that the nation's understandable obsession with al-Qaida has created narrow corridors of inquiry that may cause it to miss new threats and combinations of threats. Complicating the discussion is how the United States performs threat assessment itself. Homeland security is largely driven not by what terrorists have done in the past, but rather by what we fear they might become capable of in the future. The success of the terrorist attacks on 9/11 was attributed to failures of imagination by U.S. authorities--they failed to conceive of such a plot. That cannot be allowed to happen again. The government is pushed to prepare for every imaginable terrorist scenario. That gets costly. Ensuring homeland security in an era of budget constraints. Thus far, the intelligence and homeland security budgets have come through congressional battles comparatively unscathed. That may not last. In the years immediately following 9/11, the United States hastily built a homeland security apparatus and gave it an ambitious assignment. But everything done then is probably not equally necessary now. It is time for review. Unlike America's past wars, the battle against terrorism will not allow demobilization. The terrorist threats the nation faces today are the new normal--homeland security will be an enduring task. Whatever is done must be sustainable. The government could simply impose across-the-board percentage cuts, or it could carry out a more discerning audit to identify where it can trim without significantly increasing risk. Are there any homeland security programs that no longer make sense? Does the Department of Homeland Security provide increased effectiveness, economies of scale, or other added value, or does it just impose an additional layer of bureaucracy? These are tough questions, but they must be asked. Homegrown terrorism and domestic intelligence. Today's conflicts make no distinction between frontlines and homefronts. What happens abroad may directly affect local communities. As the United States reduces its presence in Afghanistan and loses some valuable connections in countries like Egypt and Syria where internal conflicts rage, preventing terrorist attacks in the United States increasingly depends on domestic intelligence collection. The record in dealing with the threat of homegrown terrorism is so far very good. To begin with, intensive online jihadist sales campaigns have gained little traction among theoretically susceptible communities. America's Muslims, like most Muslims worldwide, reject al-Qaida's message. In the more than 12 years since 9/11, only a couple hundred people have been arrested for providing material support to terrorist groups, attempting to join jihadist fronts abroad, or, more seriously, plotting to carry out terrorist attacks in this country. Of more than 40 jihadist terrorist plots since 9/11, intelligence efforts have uncovered and thwarted all but four. Those arrested have, for the most part, not been the cunning ""lone wolves"" often portrayed in the press. Rather, they have been barely competent (although still potentially lethal) stray dogs, many of whom appear to have embraced al-Qaida's extremist ideology as a conveyor of individual discontent. But that could change as a new generation of terrorists emerges, one that could include foreign fighters hardened by their participation in the war in Syria. Domestic intelligence collection in a democracy is always a delicate and contentious business. There has been public pushback on many domestic intelligence activities. Some communities resent being a focus of domestic intelligence activities. Others criticize sting operations and other controversial investigative techniques. But heading off attacks before they occur rather than investigating them afterward requires aggressive intelligence. It is against this backdrop that Congress will address the NSA's data collection programs. Does the need for collective security threaten individual liberties? The NSA's collection of vast quantities of personal data has put the matter of personal privacy front and center. For more than 12 years, the United States has pursued terrorists as the principal threat to America's national security, and national emergencies call for extraordinary measures. But extraordinary measures are usually suspended at the end of emergencies (or they are clawed back when there is evidence of abuse). The swing of the pendulum is a popular metaphor, which would be reassuring if it could be relied upon. But what if the right metaphor is a ratchet that goes only one way? When extraordinary measures become permanent, personal liberties can erode. And enough of this erosion can alter the nature of the relationship between the public and its government. Americans expect the government to protect them from terrorism. At the same time, the public bridles at government intrusions on its personal privacy. In the current debate about the NSA, this is understandable. Few people find reassurance in secret legislation authorizing secret programs monitored by secret courts. Some may hail Edward Snowden for revealing the details of the NSA's programs and provoking a needed national debate. But his actions only contribute to further distrust, not just because of what they revealed, but also because they show how damaging a single self-appointed crusader can be--no matter the motives. If it is acceptable for Snowden to place his personal beliefs above the law, then what's to stop the next sincere patriot or overzealous prosecutor from unilaterally exploiting access to data for whatever reason? Inarguably, America's counterterrorism regime has been successful since the 9/11 attacks. But it's time for a public debate in America--an enlightened discussion that focuses anew on threats, risks, and costs. Americans should be able to discuss the terrorist threat and how best to meet it, how much of the country's precious resources should be devoted to homeland security, and the impact intelligence efforts can have on personal privacy and freedom. It is up to the American public to decide what risks it will endure and what cost it will bear to defend lives and liberties."	The Real Homeland Security Issues for 2014	[]	[]
28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/01/republican_party_plots_immigration_reform_gop_wants_to_appear_reasonable.html	"CAMBRIDGE, Md.--House Republicans had promised it for weeks: When they gathered for their annual policy retreat, they'd tell you their immigration policy. A front-page Tuesday scoop in the New York Times claimed they'd call ""for a path to legal status - but not citizenship - for many of the 11 million adult immigrants who are in the country illegally."" And so they did. Shortly after 4 p.m., allies of the immigrant legalization movement started catching leaks of the GOP draft humbly named ""Standards for Immigration Reform."" There was the finger-wagging denunciation of a ""special path to citizenship,"" there was the ""legal residence,"" and there was the carve-out ""for those who were brought to this country as children through no fault of their own."" By 4:20, New York Sen. Chuck Schumer (co-sponsor of the Senate immigration bill) had praised the framework. By 4:30, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions (the hammer-swinging opponent of said bill) had denounced it. The conference's discussion session on immigration reform was supposed to start at 4:30. Of course, everything about this year's conference carried a sense of the inevitable. Republicans hardly even pretended that they might lose their House majority this year. Addressing reporters in the Hyatt's riverside restaurant, where a closed bar was advertising ""Throwback Thursday"" drink specials, House campaign chairman and Oregon Rep. Greg Walden bragged about Democratic retirements and suggested that the GOP would win some seats. ""I'm not going to predict whether it's six or 30,"" he said. With the House locked up, Republicans see 2014 as a chance to take the Senate. If they win the upper chamber, they will pass their own bills and dare a lame-duck Barack Obama to veto them. If Obama's spending his last two years on defense, Republicans can then concentrate on winning the White House. That's where immigration reform comes in, and where a companion plan for an Obamacare ""replacement"" follows. The Republican Party and (especially) the Congress remain far less popular than the president--not a problem for 2014, given the electoral map, but quite a problem for 2016. And so, in Cambridge, the party's leaders and more loyal backbenchers moved in and out of the conference's press room to sell their evolution from ""opposition"" to ""alternative."" As ""messaging,"" it seemed to work. The Capitol Hill press corps was joined by a larger-than-usual contingent of Spanish-language media, asking Republicans to commit to do something or other by the end of the year. None of them said no. ""It's something we've got to take up and work on,"" said Walden. ""I think it's time to deal with it,"" said Speaker of the House John Boehner. ""If we fix our broken immigration system,"" said Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, who chairs the conservative Republican Study Committee, ""I think you'll see that number of people here illegally drop dramatically."" The do-something impulse terrifies parts of the party's base. After Walden's remarks were reported, Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol accused him of threatening the land with ""Speaker Pelosi."" ""If GOP leadership proceeds with this unique combination of cynicism and recklessness,"" wrote Kristol, ""who could blame some voters for supporting such an independent candidate in November?"" On Twitter, single-term Tea Party Rep. Joe Walsh threatened that ""[i]f Republicans push for legalization or citizenship, there may be no denying that the time for a third party is upon us."" Republicans simply aren't worrying about that. Walden openly admitted that a bill might be easiest to pass in or after June, once most of the possible primary challenges from the right were dispensed with. Would the ""legal residence"" for workers, be it limited to agricultural workers or expanded to other vocations, take away jobs from American citizens in highly depressed areas? No sense worrying about that. ""Any time you have more people and more workers, that's a good thing,"" said Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger. ""The question is: Do you give citizenship to people who came here the wrong way? These programs have to be well-crafted to make sure they're not taking jobs away from Americans, but I've talked to a lot of farmers who say it's important to have legal status. Citizenship or legalization--that's kind of the sexy issue everybody's talking about. Maybe you give that chance [for citizenship] to their children."" The beauty of the ""principles"" was in their studied lack of specificity. There's nothing in them about the specific triggers that would be hit before some immigrants were eligible for citizenship. The denial of a ""special path"" to citizenship is understood, by reform advocates, as loose language that would prevent deportation and keep the non-special path wide-open. And the lines about citizenship for children really is bold, in a party where efforts to deny automatic ""anchor baby"" citizenship in line with the 14th Amendment crop up from time to inopportune time. What if none of this results in an actual bill? Politically, that might be the best outcome for the party. That's the point of looking and sounding open to negotiation--redefining President Obama as unreasonable, obstinate, and tyrannical. A couple of days before the conference, I asked Florida Sen. Marco Rubio whether ""legalization"" without citizenship required a bill at all. The president could, after all, issue an executive action, calling off deportations. ""That would be a terrible mistake,"" said Rubio. ""No. 1, it would expire at the end of his presidency. No. 2, I think it's an overreach of his powers. No. 3, he's already said he would not do that, so if he did, he'd be violating a promise he made. No. 4, it would set back even further the hopes of arriving at a solution that's responsible."" Rubio isn't really relevant to the process in the House, but he knows what they're thinking. Immigration reformers have managed to keep their cause alive, in a year when the House has no political incentive to pass it. They could still get what they want. But Republicans could get what they want, too, without satisfying the reformers. And everybody knows that as they plow ahead."

Rep. Randy Weber, a conservative who'd narrowly won the Gulf Coast seat vacated by Ron Paul, put his deep thoughts in the form of a tweet. This went viral, as it was designed to, and as the White House could only hope it would. Senior advisers had promised a speech that would pledge fast action for whenever the Congress inevitably took a pratfall and failed to do anything. The speech lived up to the leaks. ""I'm eager to work with all of you,"" the president told legislators, ""but America does not stand still--and neither will I. So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that's what I'm going to do."" Spoken like a man with a 44 percent approval rating talking to politicians with a number 30 points closer to zero. It's been like this ever since John Podesta left the Center for American Progress to join the White House. CAP and other organs on the left are brimming with ideas for extracongressional end runs. Obama's never stronger than when he's signing a popular bill, which hasn't happened in a while, or when Republicans are making exploitable errors, which happens every 20 or minutes or so. The early leaks of the speech did both tricks. On Monday and Tuesday, finding a Republican who'd denounce Obama's executive actions--whatever they were--was easier than breathing. ""We're going to watch very closely,"" intoned Speaker of the House John Boehner after the conference meeting. ""There's a Constitution that we all take an oath to, including him, and following the Constitution is the basis for House Republicans."" More resonant warnings followed, from Republicans who had been characterizing all of Obama's actions--delays to the health care law, EPA rules, deferred action on certain deportations--as petty tyranny. ""Dictatorships are often characterized by an abundance of laws,"" wrote Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the Wall Street Journal. ""When a president can pick and choose which laws to follow and which to ignore, he is no longer a president."" Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul weighed in, too, though his dark cloud concealed a rainbow. ""I think it's disturbing,"" he said, ""and I think the Supreme Court is going to rebuke him, in the near future, on the idea that he can go around Congress and decide when we're in session for recess appointments. I hope that that would chasten him, not embolden him."" A State of the Union isn't really an occasion for chastening, but the White House didn't go as far as conservatives feared. The president announced, for the second time in a day, an executive order that would raise the minimum wage for future federal contractors. ""I intend to lead by example,"" he said. He planned to ""direct the Treasury to create a new way for working Americans to start their own retirement savings"" and ""use my authority to protect more of our pristine federal lands."" Twice, he sketched out a reform and said that it would work best ""if Congress wants to help."" That was it, really, but it raised all the expected hackles. South Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson, who became famous when he yelped ""you lie"" during Obama's 2009 address, left the House chamber shaking his head. ""I think it's just wrong,"" he said. ""He calls on us to work together, then he threatens to act unilaterally? It just doesn't fit."" Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, who's retiring at the end of 2014, watched the speech while taking notes on a paper transcript. When a line shocked her, she took off her reading glasses and shook her head. She left the speech raring to pass a bill that would let Congress more easily sue the president when he started firing off executive orders. ""The Congress is going to push back,"" she said. ""The president has refused to faithfully execute the laws of the United States, which is required under Article II."" ""You want to sue the president?"" asked a reporter. ""That's what the American people are calling on us to do,"" said Bachmann. ""The president of the United States is announcing ahead of time that he will unilaterally act, pronounce laws, without Congress. He's changing the economic livelihood of the American people."" A different sort of worry flowed from the Republicans who actually want to work with the administration. Florida Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who gave the Spanish-language response to the speech, wants an immigration bill to pass this year. ""I represent a majority-Hispanic district,"" she said. ""I'm thinking about freedom for oppressed peoples or immigration--those are my two issues. But when the president takes executive action and changes what we do or don't do, my Republican colleagues ask, 'Well, how do we know that what we do on immigration will stay?' Even though the end result, I like--deferred action on DREAMers, that's good--but if we could only work through the legislative process first, it would be a better process."" Would that perspective change at the end of the year? If 2014 ran out and Congress hadn't passed a bill, would she want the president to wield his pen and extend deferred action to more immigrants? ""We're never going to see it as OK,"" she said, ""but we'd get the sense--well, he's trying. He worked through the process. But how many executive actions did he say tonight? We're just taken aback whenever he says it."" Not Democrats. They were thrilled. Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, answered a question about the executive actions by ticking through all the failures of the Republican House. California Rep. Mark Takano, one of the progressives who'd pressured the White House to raise the minimum wage for contractors, quoted a Spanish motto he'd just learned: !Obama, escucha, estamos en la lucha! ""Obama, listen, we're in the fight!"" ""The great thing about executive actions is that you keep on looking for opportunities,"" said Takano. ""Someone asked me, do I want to see an executive order in regard to LGBT folks. Well, as Scarlett O'Hara said, 'Tomorrow's another day.'
