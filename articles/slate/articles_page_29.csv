Bernie Sanders. The topic is gun control, but the angle is gender. Clinton is framing Sanders as a sexist who accuses women of shouting when they try to speak up. It's a lie. She's manipulating women and abusing feminist anger for her own advantage. It's great that we're more aware of bigotry than we used to be. But we should also beware false claims of bigotry: the race card, the sex card, the homophobia card. In 1991, Clarence Thomas, a well-connected federal judge, evaded sexual harassment allegations and won confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court by accusing his interrogators of a ""high-tech lynching for uppity blacks."" Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, says anyone who advocates a boycott of his country ""should be treated exactly as we treat any anti-Semite or bigot."" Sexism, racism, and anti-Semitism are real. But sometimes they're fabricated. That's what Clinton is doing. She's misrepresenting an exchange that took place at the Oct. 13 Democratic presidential debate. During the exchange, Clinton accused Sanders of voting with the gun lobby. Sanders replied: ""All the shouting in the world is not going to do what I would hope all of us want, and that is keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have those guns and end this horrible violence."" Sanders argued that people on both sides of the gun debate should agree to ""strengthen and expand instant background checks, do away with this gun show loophole,"" ""deal with the straw-man purchasing issue,"" and ""address the issue of mental health."" The man standing to Clinton's left during this exchange, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, joined in the attack on Sanders. To this, the Vermont senator answered with the same message: ""Here is the point, governor. We can raise our voices. But I come from a rural state, and the views on gun control in rural states are different than in urban states, whether we like it or not. Our job is to bring people together around strong, common-sense gun legislation."" Two days after the debate, Clinton brought up the exchange during a speech to the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in San Antonio. She promised to stand up to the gun lobby and, dropping her G's, added: ""I've been told by some to quit talkin' about this, to quit shoutin' about this. Well, I'll tell you right now, I will not be silenced, and we will not be silenced."" The crowd loved it. The next day in New Hampshire, Clinton tried the same line in a Yankee-friendly accent: ""Some people say that we shouldn't talk about it. Some say we shouldn't shout about it, that I shouldn't shout about it. Well, I think we have to keep talking. But more importantly, we have to act."" A week went by. Clinton prepared for her Oct. 22 testimony before the House Select Committee on Benghazi. When she returned to the campaign trail on Oct. 23, in a speech to the Democratic National Committee Women's Leadership Forum, her account of the exchange with Sanders was no longer just about guns. It was about sexism. ""You know,"" she began--clearing her throat to signal the sound bite ahead--""I've been told to stop, and I quote, 'shouting' about gun violence. Well, first of all, I'm not shouting. It's just [that] when women talk, some people think we're shouting."" The audience hooted, screamed, and cheered. Clinton grinned. ""I will not be silenced, because we will not be silenced,"" she declared. On social media, Clinton's campaign made the new line--""When women talk, some people think we're shouting""-- her message of the day. Her team posted it on her Twitter feed at 8:30 Friday morning, two hours before her speech to the DNC forum, as a rebuke to ""those who tell her to 'stop shouting' on issues that matter."" The quote also went up on her Facebook page and her campaign website, under the headline, ""Hillary Clinton Just Said Something Women Have Been Thinking for Years."" The next day, at a Democratic dinner in Iowa, Clinton repeated the applause line: ""I've been told to stop shouting about ending gun violence. Well, I haven't been shouting. But sometimes, when a woman speaks out, some people think it's shouting. But I won't be silenced, and I hope you won't be either."" Clinton doesn't use Sanders' name when she tells this story. She doesn't have to: Everyone who saw the debate or heard about it knows she's talking about him. She's using the story to bond with women, to paint Sanders as a patronizing old fart, and to portray herself as a victim. Let's be clear: This isn't what happened. During the debate exchange, Sanders answered O'Malley with the same point about ""raising our voices."" Sanders has been giving this answer for years. He did it in July, after an O'Malley super PAC ad attacked him (""We have been yelling and screaming at each other about guns for decades,"" said Sanders). He did it again in August, after a male surrogate for Clinton attacked him (""I can get beyond the noise and all of these arguments and people shouting at each other""). He did it again in October, after the mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon (""People on both sides of this issue cannot simply continue shouting at each other""). Sanders gives this answer to everyone. The charitable explanation of Clinton's behavior is that she sincerely perceived Sanders' rebuke during the debate as sexist. But if that were true, you'd expect her to have said so in her first accounts of the exchange. She didn't. She waited more than a week before embellishing the story. She prepared it as a sound bite for social media, and she unveiled it at a women's forum. And it worked, so she's still using it. Enough. Sanders' record as a feminist is as good as Clinton's. No honest reading of his career or his comments about guns can construe him as a sexist. Clinton is trying to connect with women who have felt bullied by men, and to turn them against Sanders, by smearing him. And what's true of racism and anti-Semitism is just as true of sexism: The more seriously you take the real thing, the more you should revile people who use it as a fraud."	Hillary Clinton Is Smearing Bernie Sanders as a Sexist

Why did he change his mind? The short of it, according to Alberta, is that after weeks of panicked phone calls from Republican luminaries, the Wisconsin congressman was persuaded that if he failed to step up to lead Republicans in the House, the chaos and dissension that would result would badly damage if not doom GOP prospects in 2016. Having won over most of the Republican rebels who made Speaker John Boehner's life a living hell, Ryan is all but certain to win the speaker's race. This was no small feat. Roughly 70 percent of the members of the House Freedom Caucus have backed Ryan despite serious misgivings about Ryan's heresies on the infamous Wall Street bailout (he voted for it), the fiscal cliff deal (he voted for that too), and amnesty for unauthorized immigrants (he's for it). That means that henceforth, it is Ryan who will be charged with the unenviable task of preventing future outbreaks of Republican-on-Republican violence. How will he manage it? The smartest thing Ryan has done so far is pledge not to push for comprehensive immigration reform legislation as long as President Obama is still in office. It is no secret that Ryan supports giving unauthorized immigrants a path to citizenship and increasing legal immigration. In 2005, he co-sponsored the McCain-Kennedy immigration bill that set off a Republican civil war and helped set the stage for huge Democratic victories in the 2006 congressional elections. And Ryan has been willing to work with Democrats in the years since, to the chagrin of conservative Republicans who oppose amnesty in any form and who want to see immigration levels reduced. This week, however, Ryan has assured anti-immigration conservatives that he no longer sees the president as an honest broker on immigration and that he recognizes that comprehensive reform is ""too divisive"" to take on, at least for now. But he has said that he would be open to immigration legislation that unites Republicans in Congress, like measures that strengthen immigration enforcement. One of the more persistent concerns of immigration hawks is that while border security has been tightened, far more could be done to improve worksite enforcement and employer verification and to help ensure that visa overstayers are identified and removed. By backing meaningful immigration enforcement legislation, Ryan would go a long way toward healing the GOP's biggest divide. Every other issue is going to be more challenging. Earlier this year, the political scientists Matt Grossmann and David A. Hopkins published an article on the fundamental asymmetry in U.S. party politics. Grossmann and Hopkins observe that while the GOP is best understood as ""the agent of an ideological movement whose supporters prize doctrinal purity,"" the Democratic Party is ""a coalition of social groups seeking concrete government action."" To oversimplify matters, Democrats are far more inclined to believe that half a loaf is better than none while Republicans tend to fixate on questions of principle. Ryan's central challenge as speaker is that he fully appreciates something that many of his colleagues do not, which is that only a minority of Americans are committed ideological conservatives. To win elections and pass legislation, you must persuade at least some people who don't share your ideological priors. Ryan's pragmatic streak is why he has spent much of the past few years trying to craft bipartisan proposals to fight poverty and trim the budget deficit, despite the fact that doing so has lost him at least some friends on the right. Several of Ryan's supposed heresies reflect an understanding that, as he said to the conservative journalist Philip Klein in 2010, ""Sometimes you have to take votes you don't want to take, but they're the best of two choices."" As an example, Ryan explained to Klein that the reason he backed the Wall Street bailout is that he feared the alternative would have been an economic collapse, which in turn would have paved the way for a massive expansion of government. Similarly, Ryan is lambasted by conservatives for backing the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, a sprawling, expensive proposal that established a new Medicare prescription drug benefit. He defends his vote by saying that had Congress not passed the Medicare Modernization Act, it would have passed some other Medicare-expanding legislation that would not have included its various free-market reforms. Judging by the growing popularity of Medicare Advantage, the optional Medicare private insurance plans that were one of the chief fruits of that legislation and which many conservatives see as the basis for future Medicare reform, it seems that Ryan was right. Over the long term, the Medicare Modernization Act has left conservatives in a better position to advance their goals than another bill that would have just established a new prescription drug benefit and left it at that. Half a loaf really did prove to be better than none. The question is whether Ryan can persuade his fellow House Republicans that incremental progress is worth fighting for. The greatest danger facing Republicans in the coming months is what you might call the politics of wishful thinking. Paul Ryan's job will be to convince Republicans, including Freedom Caucus Republicans, to face certain realities. On the budget, Freedom Caucus Republicans believe that they can extract concessions from President Obama and his Democratic allies because they can force a government shutdown. What they don't seem to realize is that if they force a government shutdown, they'll be blamed for it. Roughly the same logic applies to the debt limit increase. The president is unwilling to bargain with Republicans to get a debt limit increase, and for good reason--it makes absolutely no sense to have to authorize an increase in the debt limit when Congress has already voted to spend more money than the Treasury collects in taxes. Members of the Freedom Caucus might believe that they're doing the White House a favor by agreeing to increase the debt limit, but almost no one else in the country sees it that way. Another drawn-out debt limit fight can only end in tears for the GOP. Why does Ryan have a better shot at selling Republicans on pragmatism than Boehner or Kevin McCarthy? It's simple. While it's never been clear exactly what Boehner or McCarthy stand for, most conservatives, including diehard Freedom Caucus Republicans, recognize that Ryan is a conservative true believer and that every pragmatic accommodation he makes is with an eye toward moving government in a more conservative direction. Ryan's critics might not agree with him on every tactical decision, but they recognize his sincerity and his commitment. That counts for something. Whether it will be enough to keep the fractious House Republican Conference together is another story."	Can Paul Ryan Teach the Freedom Caucus to Embrace His Pragmatic Approach? 
2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/iowa_republicans_love_ben_carson_the_state_s_conservative_caucus_goers_have.html	"Iowa Republicans do more than endure fringe candidates--they embrace them. In Iowa, factional candidates excel and extremists find ground to run. In 1988, Pat Robertson took a strong second in the Iowa caucuses. In 1996, another Pat--Pat Buchanan--came close to toppling Bob Dole. In 2008, Mike Huckabee won the contest, and in 2012, Rick Santorum won a slim victory over Mitt Romney. And ahead of the 2016 Republican presidential contest, Iowa Republicans are poised to give their votes to retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. According to the latest poll from Bloomberg Politics and the Des Moines Register, Carson is ahead of the pack with 28 percent of the vote. But more interesting are the facts behind his rise. Iowans aren't just charmed by his demeanor, his experience, and his inexperience as a politician and policymaker--although that's definitely true--they also support his most controversial, and entirely ludicrous, ideas. Bloomberg Politics and the Des Moines Iowa Register asked respondents which views were ""very attractive,"" ""mostly attractive,"" ""mostly unattractive,"" and ""very unattractive."" It starts off as you would expect. Eighty-five percent of respondents say Carson's lack of experience is mostly or very attractive; 88 percent say the same for his skill as a neurosurgeon, while 49 percent say it's unattractive that he has little experience with foreign policy. Routine, so far. But then it goes off the rails. Two years ago, at the Values Voter Summit, Carson said that the Affordable Care Act--designed to increase health coverage for millions of uninsured Americans--was the ""worst thing that has happened in this country since slavery,"" which trapped millions of people in brutal hereditary bondage for more than two centuries. American slavery was a disgraceful chapter in our history that still shapes the structure of our society. Obamacare, by contrast, has delivered insurance and health services to 17.6 million people. What do Iowa Republicans think? Eighty-one percent say this makes him a ""mostly"" or ""very"" attractive candidate. Last month, Carson voiced opposition to a hypothetical Muslim president. ""I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation. I absolutely would not agree with that,"" he said. This, despite the Constitution's clear dictate on religious tests--they're verboten. What do Iowa Republicans think? Seventy-seven percent say this makes him a ""mostly"" or ""very"" attractive candidate. Two weeks ago, Carson said that guns--in the hands of German Jews--could have slowed Adolf Hitler and even stopped the Holocaust. ""I think the likelihood of Hitler being able to accomplish his goals would have been greatly diminished if the people have been armed,"" he said. Historians think this is ludicrous. ""I can think of no serious work of scholarship on the Nazi dictatorship or the causes of the Holocaust in which Nazi gun control measures feature as a significant factor,"" wrote Alan Steinweis for the New York Times. Armed Jews, especially in the years before the war, might have stopped some Nazi violence, but given Kristallnacht--whose pretext was the assassination of a German diplomat by a German-born Jewish refugee in France--it's just as possible that it would have led to more and worse reprisals for German Jews. Above all, the possibility of more guns does nothing for the vast majority of Jewish victims--Russians, Poles, Hungarians, and others--who were trapped between the Nazi war machine and the Soviet army. What do Iowa Republicans think? A whopping 77 percent say that Carson's statement makes him ""very"" or ""mostly"" attractive. Overall--presumably based on his beliefs and opinions--96 percent of Iowa Republicans are attracted by ""common sense""-based approach to issues. If there's an area where respondents were unhappy, it's with Carson's fetal tissue research as a neurosurgeon. Forty-eight percent find it ""mostly"" or ""very"" unattractive. Still, the retired doctor is stunningly popular with Iowa Republicans--84 percent have a favorable view of him. None of this means Carson will win. The vast majority of Iowa Republicans are still undecided. As the caucus comes closer, their preference might change. And other candidates, like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, are also popular with GOP voters in the state. What it does mean, if anything, is that Carson speaks the language of Iowa Republicans. They like his rhetoric, whether it's absurd, ignorant, or genuinely offensive. With that said, Carson will fade; he has cash, but he doesn't have a campaign. His money, for the most part, goes to raising more money, not to staffers, offices, or an infrastructure. But when he does, it will be because Republican voters got serious, not because of what he said. And that--if you care about the outcomes of American politics, and not just the spectacle--is troubling."	It's No Surprise That Iowans Love Ben Carson's Most Offensive Views
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/the_benghazi_committee_s_clinton_email_and_sidney_blumenthal_obsession_may.html	"Rep. Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, was determined heading into Thursday's hearing with Hillary Clinton to prove that the committee is not on a partisan witch hunt against the former secretary of state and Democratic primary front-runner. She is just one of dozens of witnesses, Gowdy explained, and his committee simply wanted to get a better portrait on the Sept. 11, 2012, attack. It was a gathering process, not a prosecution. Yet Gowdy--who was chosen to lead the committee specifically because of his experience as a prosecutor--and several of his Republican colleagues focused on gathering one specific piece of information above all others: why she was such a fastidious emailer when exchanging messages with unsavory figures like longtime confidant Sidney Blumenthal, but a ghost when it came to swapping messages with U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, who was killed in the attack. In doing so they not only emphasized the political nature of the investigation, but also offered a narrow and easily repelled view of the way the secretary of state conducted her job. Let's first stipulate that few figures on either side of the aisle have availed themselves particularly well so far--making it your standard Capitol Hill hearing. The Republicans have badgered her with tangential questions about emails to Blumenthal, while the Democrats are essentially narrating campaign commercials for her. The hearing is well on its way to producing a gray blob of mush for the general public to consume or, more likely, ignore. It's true, as Republican members pointed out repeatedly, that Blumenthal emailed her a lot--about the situation in Libya, his thoughts on climate change, excerpts from his son Max's articles or books, and so forth. What Gowdy and members like Reps. Peter Roskam, Lynn Westmoreland, and Mike Pompeo tried to press her into saying was that she treated Blumenthal's correspondences--and their frequently political or inaccurate nature--more seriously than she treated communication with Stevens. It was Westmoreland, for example, who got Clinton to concede that Stevens did not have her personal email: Westmoreland: You got a lot of emails from Sidney Blumenthal. And you say that Mr. Blumenthal was a friend of yours. And he had your personal email address. You say Chris Stevens was a friend of yours. He asked numerous of times for extra protection. Now, if I had been Mr. Stevens--and I think anybody out there--anybody watching this would agree. If I had been Mr. Stevens, and I had had a relationship with you, and I had requested 20 or more times for additional security to protect not only my life but the people that were there with me, I would have gotten in touch with you some way. I would have let you know that I was in danger, and that the situation had deteriorated to a point, I needed you to do something. Did he have your personal email? Clinton: Congressman, I--I do not believe that he had my personal email. Pompeo continued in the same vein, contrasting Stevens' and Blumenthal's access to Clinton: Pompeo: I want to go back to a couple things I talked to you about a bit before, Madam Secretary. Ambassador Stevens didn't have your email, correct? Your personal email? Clinton: I'm sorry, what did you ask me? Pompeo: Ambassador Stevens didn't have your personal email, we've established that. Clinton: That's right. Pompeo: Did he have your cellphone number? Clinton: No, but he had the 24-hour number in the State Department that can reach me 24/7. Pompeo: Yes, ma'am. Did he have the fax number? Clinton: He had the fax number of the State Department. Pompeo: Did he have [your] home address? Clinton: No, I don't think any ambassador has ever asked me for that. Pompeo: Did he ever stop by your house? Clinton: No, he did not, congressman. Pompeo: Mr. Blumenthal had each of those and did each of those things. This man who provided you so much information on Libya had access to you in ways that were very different than the access that a very senior diplomat had to your--to you and your person. Again, Pompeo does a fine job establishing something. But what? That Clinton was on closer personal terms with Sid Blumenthal than she was Chris Stevens, or maybe that Blumenthal knew better how to spam her than Stevens did? As people have been saying for some 20 years to no avail, the Clintons would do well to cut Blumenthal out of the loop. Maybe they'll learn someday, but probably not, and that's why it's politically useful for Republicans to keep mentioning his name. In terms of establishing what went wrong in Benghazi, though, her close email contact with Blumenthal and nonexistent correspondence with Stevens over email does not prove that she was ignoring Stevens or other State Department officials working in Libya. Clinton explained to Westmoreland that while Stevens did not email her at all hours of the night with wacko theories or his son's articles, they did speak--on something called ""the telephone,"" or in person. More often, Stevens did what most people working in federal departments do: He obeyed the chain of command, rather than taking every query he had directly to Hillary Clinton. This meant taking his security concerns to people specifically assigned to dealing with them, Clinton said:"	The Benghazi Committee's Clinton Email and Sid Blumenthal Obsession May Be Its Undoing
4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/the_freedom_caucus_called_paul_ryan_s_bluff_he_s_doomed.html	"Rep. Paul Ryan's conditions for becoming speaker now seem more like, well, guidelines. The great savior of the House of Representatives made explicit in the past couple of weeks that he had no interest in serving as the third-highest-ranking official in American government. He enjoys fiddling around with the tax code as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee almost as much as he enjoys shooting deer with his children. And he enjoys both things much more than he enjoys the prospect of trying in vain to persuade some 40-odd nihilists to fund the federal government every few months. Ryan took the leverage that the Draft Ryan campaign offered him to set out some terms for accepting the gig. Though pitched as conditions that all factions would have to sign off on, they were obviously targeted to the House Freedom Caucus conservatives who took out Speaker John Boehner and pre-emptively nixed Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's bid. Ryan, arguing that he didn't want to be the ""third log in the fire,"" requested a change in the rules that would make it much more difficult to evict a sitting speaker. He also requested the endorsement of each of the House Republican Conference's major factions. The Freedom Caucus acceded to neither. The group, which has been around for less than a year but is just old enough to have a hilarious set of bylaws, only ""endorses""--agrees to vote as a bloc--when 80 percent of its members sign off. Following a meeting in the Capitol on Wednesday night, the Freedom Caucus announced that it did not have enough internal agreement to ""endorse"" Ryan, but a ""supermajority"" did vote ""to support Paul Ryan's bid to become the next Speaker of the House."" Further, the group stated that while ""no consensus exists among members of the House Freedom Caucus regarding Chairman Ryan's preconditions for serving, we believe that these issues can be resolved within our Conference in due time."" The Freedom Caucus' shrewd counteroffer--no endorsement but a ""supermajority"" of support, and no rule changes but a promise to consider them later--was suitable to Ryan. ""I'm grateful for the support of a supermajority of the House Freedom Caucus,"" Ryan said in a statement. ""I look forward to hearing from the other two caucuses by the end of the week, but I believe this is a positive step towards a unified Republican team."" It sounds like Speaker Ryan is a go, and if so, this is an inauspicious start to his tenure. (Update, Oct. 22, 7:30 p.m.: Ryan made his speakership bid official on Thursday night.) He set terms intended to bring the Freedom Caucus to heel, and the Freedom Caucus didn't agree to them but came just close enough to agreeing that it believed it'd avoid blame if Ryan bowed out. In other words, they seem to have successfully called Ryan's bluff. (We've requested comment from Ryan's communications director at the Ways and Means Committee, Brendan Buck, but in the meantime we'll have to wait to see what resolving issues ""within our Conference in due time"" means.) It's also seriously troubling that Ryan reportedly agreed to abide by the so-called Hastert rule, which states that a speaker will only call up legislation that has the support of a majority of the majority conference. Boehner, too, tried to follow this rule, only to realize that adhering to it would mean the government would never be funded and the debt ceiling would never be raised. In the current configuration of the House, obeying the Hastert rule means abandoning the natural, ad-hoc governing coalition of Democrats and procedurally moderate Republicans that exists. It means obliging conservatives and calling up only their hardline legislation that goes nowhere in the Senate and faces a veto from President Obama. It means agreeing to a rule that needs to be broken in order to ensure global economic stability. Assuming Ryan doesn't abruptly drop his bid in the next couple of days, let's hope that he and the Freedom Caucus have a gentlemen's understanding to which we're not privy, or the Freedom Caucus has offered him a grace period before running him out of town. If not, Ryan's early concessions position him to be Boehner II, strung around on a leash by the radicals."	The Freedom Caucus Just Called Paul Ryan's Bluff. He's Doomed.
5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/why_joe_biden_decided_not_to_run_the_vice_president_couldn_t_win.html	"For three months, Washington has wondered: Will Joe Biden run for president? On Wednesday, Biden answered no. ""As my family and I have worked through the grieving process ... I've said time and again that it may very well be that the process, by the time we get through it, closes the window on mounting a realistic campaign for president,"" said the vice president in an address in the White House Rose Garden with his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, and President Obama. ""I've concluded, it has closed."" His announcement follows days of speculation from pundits, and rhetoric--from the vice president--that struck a critical note on Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner. On Tuesday, for instance, he made a quip at Clinton's expense while speaking at an event honoring former Sen. Walter Mondale. ""I really respect the members up there, and I still have a lot of Republican friends. I don't think my chief enemy is the Republican Party. This is a matter of making things work."" And on the subject of Clinton's tenure as secretary of state, he made this comment. ""I will get sent to go to speak with Putin or speak to Erdogan or go speak to whomever and it's because the secretary of state--and we've had two great secretaries of state--but when I go they know that I'm speaking for the president,"" he said. Biden isn't thrilled with Clinton, but he isn't going to challenge her. And for good reason: He'd lose. For all the attention on Biden's quantum campaign, there was never a case for his candidacy. Even with bad news, a slow summer, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, Hillary was dominant in the Democratic field. With two exceptions--a CNN survey from early September and a Bloomberg one from the end of that month--Clinton never dropped below 40 percent in national polls of the Democratic race. Anticipating a campaign, pollsters have asked voters to rank Biden with Clinton, Sanders, Martin O'Malley, Jim Webb, and Lincoln Chafee. In these polls, Clinton scores a high plurality--or occasionally a majority--of the vote. Of course, there's an easy retort--Clinton was ahead in 2007 too, before Barack Obama caught fire. And it's true: Polls, even at this stage, aren't predictive. With the right campaign, the argument goes, Biden could have won. But this ignores a whole host of facts that make 2016 a different election than the 2008 race. This Clinton, unlike her previous self, has broad support from a cross section of the Democratic Party. She has more than 100 endorsements from national Democratic officeholders and support from key members of the Obama campaign teams of 2008 and 2012. And to that point, Joe Biden isn't Barack Obama. He can't make a generational contrast, he can't claim history, and on key issues--like criminal justice, where he authored the 1994 crime bill--he can't run to Clinton's left. An exceptionally skilled politician could overcome this, but that's not Biden. He's run two campaigns for president, and both times he failed to build the kind of traction or raise the kind of money you need to win. But while Biden isn't running, it's clear he wants to. More than anything, his address was a taste of the campaign he would have run. More than Clinton, he would have run as a direct heir to the Obama legacy. ""This party, our nation, will be making a tragic mistake if we walk away or attempt to undo the Obama legacy,"" he said. ""The American people have worked too hard, and we've come too far for that. Democrats should not only defend this record and protect this record, they should run on the record."" He would have positioned himself as a fighter for middle-class interests, borrowing ideas from Clinton (greater access to child care), Sanders (""16 years of free public education""), and adding his own spin: ""We can pay for all of this with one simple step: by limiting the deductions in the tax code to 28 percent of income."" He also would have hit the same notes on social justice issues, touting rights for LGBTQ Americans, immigration reform, and equal pay. And on health care, Biden would have made a cancer treatment a top priority. ""If I could be anything, I would have wanted to be the president that ended cancer, because it's possible,"" he said. His core challenge to Clinton would have echoed Obama's from eight years prior; Biden would have pressured Clinton on national security, critiquing her zeal for intervention and military force. ""We have to accept the fact that we can't solve all the world's problems,"" he said. ""The argument that we just have to do something when bad people do bad things isn't good enough. It's not a good enough reason for American intervention and to put our sons' and daughters' lives on the line, put them at risk."" Likewise, he would have pushed unity--a new spin on ""change we can believe in."" ""I believe we have to end the divisive partisan politics that is ripping this country apart, and I think we can,"" said Biden. ""It's mean-spirited, it's petty, and it's gone on for much too long."" It's impossible to know how this would have worked in practice. Biden might have made a splash, or he might have sparked an ugly, drawn-out fight, as the worst of his career--the war on drugs, Anita Hill--came back to the light. It's also hard to know if Democrats are helped or hurt by his decision. As it stands, this--the vice presidency--is Biden's last gig in politics. And he'll finish the job in better shape than most."	Why Joe Biden Said No
6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/jim_webb_didn_t_do_what_it_takes_to_be_president_the_former_virginia_senator.html	"Running for president is hard, grueling work that almost always ends in failure. To succeed, or even come close to success, you have to commit 100 percent. You have to campaign and cajole and speak and charm and hope that voters come to your tent, and stay for the show. And even then, even if you're good, it's a crapshoot. Three months ago, in August, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb said he wanted to be president. The United States, he said, needed ""proven, experienced leadership that can be trusted to move us forward from a new president's first days in office."" Webb was far from favored to win, but he was a compelling candidate, a throwback to an older, less diverse Democratic Party that represented the bulk of America's white working-class, with a smattering of votes from black Americans and other groups. As an idiosyncratic Democrat--opposed to ""identity politics,"" skeptical of gun control, and for the Keystone pipeline, but pro-union, pro-choice, and pro-same-sex marriage--Webb could have been an unusual force in the Democratic primary, moderating candidates on some issues but pushing them to the left on others, like foreign policy, national security, and criminal justice reform. Instead, Webb didn't do anything. He was hardly on the trail in Iowa, and only made one stop in New Hampshire. ""The crickets here in New Hampshire are louder than the Webb campaign,"" said the chairman of the state's Democratic Party to Mother Jones. His press team was silent, and he hardly raised any money--just under $700,000 in the third quarter. If not for Lincoln Chafee, former governor of Rhode Island, Webb would have been at the bottom of the fundraising ladder. Webb wanted to lead the United States, but he didn't want to do the work to get to voters. And so he quit. ""I am withdrawing from any consideration of being the Democratic Party's nominee for the presidency,"" said Webb at a press conference on Tuesday, at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. Standing straight at a podium with his wife to one side and supporters on the other, Webb told a small group of reporters that he was driven away by a Democratic ""hierarchy"" that's ""not comfortable with many of the policies that I have laid forth."" Although, he added, ""I am not comfortable with many of theirs."" Webb sees Democrats--and Republicans, for that matter--as out of step with ""the people they are supposed to serve."" ""Poll after poll shows that a strong plurality of Americans is neither Republican nor Democrat,"" he said. ""Overwhemingly they're independents. Americans don't like the extremes to which both parties have moved in recent years, and I don't blame them."" Webb is leaving the Democratic race, but he's not leaving the spotlight. And while he denies plans for an independent bid, he certainly sounds like someone who might take the plunge. ""I am not going away. I am thinking through all of my options,"" he said. ""Two hundred and forty years ago, the Declaration of Independence from our status as a colony from Great Britain was announced. It's time for a new Declaration of Independence ... from the paralysis of a federal system that no longer serves the interests of the vast majority of the American people."" He continued along these lines for the rest of the announcement. ""Our political process is jammed up,"" he said. ""It needs an honest broker who respects all sides, who understands the complicated nature of how our federal system works, who will communicate a vision for our country's future here at home and in our foreign policy, and who has a proven record of gettings things done."" Hint hint. Webb, it should be said, is overselling himself. In his only campaign, the 2006 Virginia Senate race against George Allen, Webb won 42 percent of whites, basically matching Mark Warner's 2001 campaign for governor--especially among Webb's stated constituency, rural and mountain whites--and only slightly outperforming Obama's 2008 effort in the state. Webb, in short, relied on the same coalition that he says is ""out of step"" with the country at large. It's a strong clue that, in a general election, Webb would have been subject to the same forces that constrain all Democrats. Still, it's tempting to look at Webb as a good man driven out by a bad game--a rigged game, where you have to compromise to thrive. But that's nonsense. The second leading candidate in the Democratic primary--who takes a third of all Democratic voters in national polls--is Sen. Bernie Sanders, the ""democratic socialist"" from Vermont who just officially joined the Democratic Party in order to compete. Sanders isn't a part of the party hierarchy--he's trying to drive left. And it's working. Why? Because unlike Webb, Sanders is actually trying. Yes, Webb is out of step with the present-day Democratic Party, left behind in the wake of the Obama era. Ten years ago, he was touted as the kind of Democrat who would save the party--the moderate, pro-military figure who could compete with Republicans for working-class whites. But Webb's failure as a candidate has nothing to do with his distance from the Democratic mainstream. It has everything to do with his refusal to campaign for votes and support. Jim Webb wanted to be president. He just didn't want to have to work for it. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Jim Webb Wanted to Be President. He Just Didn't Want to Work for It.

Overwhelmingly, these are poor and working Americans without the steady income you need to keep an account in good order. When one month is flush and the other is fallow, it's hard to maintain a balance, which leads to fees and other hits to your income. The FDIC found that more than 57 percent of unbanked households said they didn't have enough money to keep an account or meet a minimum balance, while 35.6 percent of underbanked households said the same. Likewise, almost 1 in 3 unbanked households reported ""high or unpredictable fees"" as one reason they did not have bank accounts. Disproportionately black, Latino, and Native American, they rely on banking alternatives like payday lenders, check cashers, and pawn shops that, while predatory, are at least flexible. Which brings us to ""RushCard,"" the financial product from hip-hop and fashion mogul Russell Simmons. RushCard, according to its website, is a prepaid debit card that lets users get paychecks up to two days in advance. It takes direct deposit, and customers can add and withdraw money from ATMs. It's meant to solve the real problems that come with being unbanked or underbanked. In reality, however, it's a trap. In exchange for early access to their money, users face a web of fees and charges that add up to money you must pay to use your money. On top of a monthly fee, RushCard customers pay to withdraw from ATMs, to make point-of-sale transactions, to make signature transactions, and to receive paper statements. They also pay if their account is dormant. If RushCard were reliable, this might be a fair price for convenience. But it's not. Beginning last week, thousands of people were locked out of their accounts following an alleged ""technology transition"" from the company. As Jia Tolentino notes for Jezebel, these are people with no access to cash outside of RushCard. It's what they use to live their lives. ""I've been a RushCard member since 2009. On October 11th I ordered a new card because my other was lost. On October 12 RushCard updated its systems and it's been haywire ever since,"" wrote one user on ConsumerAffairs.* ""I have no access to my account due to whatever glitch that happen[ed] while updating system. It's been 6 days and [the] problem [is] still not fixed. My direct deposit went in and I can't pay my rent or bills."" This is a disaster, largely uncovered because of whom it affects. And that's unfortunate, as it deserves much wider attention. The RushCard fiasco illustrates the key issues of our upcoming election, from regulation of consumer financial products--politically embodied in the bitter fights over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau--to wage stagnation and unemployment that pushes poor and working Americans out of mainstream financial life, to new programs that can secure Americans against RushCard and other unscrupulous vendors. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for example, has proposed ""postal banking"" as a federally sponsored alternative to payday lenders and services like RushCard. ""USPS could partner with banks to make a critical difference for millions of Americans who don't have basic banking services because there are almost no banks or bank branches in their neighborhoods,"" she wrote in a Huffington Post op-ed last year. In this, Warren joins a chorus of liberal policy wonks and writers who see low-cost banking as a natural service for the Postal Service, in large part because it has done it before. As early as 1871, writes Mehrsa Baradaran for Slate, U.S. officials have pushed a form of postal banking. During the Taft administration--following the Panic of 1907--Congress relented, and from 1911 to 1966 (when, ironically, it was abolished under Lyndon Johnson), the United States operated the Postal Savings System. ""By 1934, postal banks had $1.2 billion in assets--about 10 percent of the entire commercial banking system--as small savers fled failing banks to the safety of a government-backed institution,"" notes Baradaran. ""Deposits also reached their peak in 1947 with almost $3.4 billion and 4 million users banking at their post offices."" In the 1940s and '50s--and even the '60s--you could get away with stuffing money in a mattress and otherwise living outside of the banking system. Now, as cash becomes electronic, it's untenable. But we don't have to leave millions of disadvantaged people to the mercy of usurious lenders and shady operators who exist to make a profit off of people who just need easy and affordable access to funds. If we're serious about enabling social mobility, then we have a public mission to help Americans save and use their money. And we can easily resurrect postal banking through law, or potentially, regulation. Of course, postal banking isn't on the 2016 radar; Bernie Sanders supports it, but outside of his interview with Fusion, that's the extent of the discussion. But it represents a divide--regulation versus indifference, a hands-on versus a hands-off government--that defines the contest between the two parties. Which is to say that postal banking--and the victims of RushCard--deserve a spot in our national conversation. *Correction, Oct. 20, 2015: This article originally misstated that the author had been a user of RushCard since 2009.

This weekend, Jeb Bush and Donald Trump slapped at each other over President George W. Bush's legacy. ""When you talk about George Bush, I mean, say what you want, the World Trade Center came down during his time,"" said Trump. Jeb Bush responded by calling him ""pathetic"" on Twitter: Trump returned the charge: While everyone was getting out the microscopes to see just how small the debate could get, Bush raised the stakes. He countered that Trump's claims about his brother were a sign that he lacked the judgment to be president. Bush's campaign released a video with clown music and a string of Trump's less confidence-inspiring statements about national security. It also made a fundraising appeal off of it. On a page with a picture of George W. Bush standing on the rubble of the World Trade Center, it reads: ""President George W. Bush kept the country safe. Help us fight back against Donald Trump's shameless attacks."" This war of words is a test of Bush's ability to take on the GOP front-runner, but it is also another way in which Trump is challenging the articles of faith in the Republican Party. Bush has been itching for a fight recently. He's poked at Sen. Marco Rubio's lack of experience and said the Florida senator was being misleading about how much money he's raised. Now Bush has taken on a harder target. His campaign advisers and aides cite pressure from donors who want to see Bush--the man once considered the front-runner--show some energy and toughness. If the GOP primary contest is going to come down to the establishment candidate versus the grassroots candidate, Bush needs to seize his place as Trump's chief opponent. These aren't the first punches Bush has thrown at the real estate mogul. Bush has tried to pick fights before with Trump over the tone of his campaign and his immigration policies. He's also charged him with being unserious before. Those jabs didn't improve his standing in the polls. His position has only gotten worse. Will this gambit now work? Bush was encouraged by the most recent debate. When Trump attacked George W. Bush at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Bush responded: ""As it relates to my brother, there's one thing I know for sure. He kept us safe."" It received the biggest applause of the night. Among Republicans, George W. Bush's favorability rating in a CNN poll this year was almost 90 percent. Among all voters in that poll, Bush's approval ratings, which were in the 20s when he left office, had climbed to more than 50 percent. In attacking W.'s legacy, Trump is actually aligning himself with an argument on the left, which has always scoffed at the claim that Bush kept America safe. Trump's position on George W. Bush is even further to the left than Hillary Clinton. When I asked her if she agreed with Jeb Bush that his brother had kept the country safe, she said, ""I think it's a complicated question, because, of course, 9/11 happened. ... And then I do give President Bush credit for trying to bring the country together around the threats that we did face. ... So if you sort it all out, you know, it's a mixed picture."" It would seem that Trump is on the wrong side of an article of faith in Republican circles. Saying that Bush kept America safe, if nothing else, acts as a bulwark against criticism that the Iraq war was a disaster. But if there's one thing that this race has taught us, it's that Trump has repealed some of the core tenets in politics. It was once considered axiomatic, for example, that Republican candidates could never say anything negative about John McCain's war heroism, or Mexicans, given the GOP's need to court Hispanic voters. And a candidate certainly couldn't say anything that might be described as sexist. Jeb Bush is asking for a referendum on his brother in a public debate with a rival he has yet to find a way to beat. He seems to think he's got a winning issue here, and Trump doesn't back down--he outlined his argument in the Washington Post--so this might not disappear as quickly as Twitter slap fights do. If it does stick around, Bush may succeed in diminishing Trump and elevating himself. The debate over exactly how Trump can blame George W. Bush's immigration policies for hijackers who came to America before his administration and how Trump would have behaved differently eight months into an administration may expose Trump as being full of bluster. If it doesn't work out that way, though, the damage may not be limited to Jeb Bush, who could emerge from the fracas looking like a candidate who only gets animated when it comes to defending his brother--a laudable quality, but also an exercise that bolts him ever closer to his brother, making it hard to prove that Jeb Bush is his own man. It's also possible that voters side with Trump in this debate as they have on previous ones. Or, the debate causes a re-evaluation of whether Bush did everything he could before 9/11. Peter Beinart makes the case in the Atlantic that he didn't. The debate could also morph into one about the folly of the Iraq war. If that's the case, Jeb will not only be diminished, but so will his brother's legacy, which was improving before Jeb entered the race. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."

9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/bernie_sanders_theory_of_change_isn_t_serious_the_vermont_senator_s_political.html	"When asked for a theory of change--and how he'll move the United States toward ""democratic socialism"" as president--Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has a simple answer. He'll inspire a ""political revolution."" ""Now, in my view, the only way we can take on the right-wing Republicans who are, by the way, I hope will not continue to control the Senate and the House when one of us [is] elected president,"" he said at Tuesday's presidential debate. ""But the only way we can get things done is by having millions of people coming together."" Sanders will build so much enthusiasm and inspire so many voters that he'll come to office with the votes he needs to pursue his plans. But there's a problem. We've seen this story before. Barack Obama entered office on a Democratic wave. He won a strong majority of the popular vote--flipping Republican states like Indiana and North Carolina--and helped Democrats win 255 seats in the House of Representatives and 56 seats in the Senate. With a sure mandate and a largely unified party, Obama was primed for success. And he got it, sort of. Over two years, Congress passed an ambitious stimulus package, health care reform, financial reform, and a bevy of smaller measures, from the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to a bill to reduce the crack and cocaine sentencing disparity. At the same time, this was a slog. Despite an economic crisis and a supportive public, Obama couldn't win Republican support for major policies. Just three Republicans crossed the aisle to vote for the stimulus, and one of them switched parties in the face of a backlash from GOP voters in his state. Without Republican support--and facing filibusters at every turn--Obama had to corral every Democrat, which gave leverage to centrist and conservative Democrats like Sens. Joe Lieberman, Ben Nelson, and Evan Bayh. It's how we got the ""Cornhusker kickback"" (which was later removed from the bill). It didn't matter that party voters were behind Obama and his priorities; if the White House didn't accommodate every Democrat, its agenda would stumble and fall. And even after Democrats won 60 seats--Al Franken entered the Senate in the summer of 2009--the challenge remained. We can criticize Obama for everything he didn't do as a legislative leader, but the truth is that his plans were steered, in large part, by the right flank of the Democratic Party. Put differently, President Obama entered office under the best circumstances for any Democrat since Lyndon Johnson won a landslide in the 1964 presidential election. Yet his core priorities nearly crashed on the rocks of Republican opposition and political venality. On Thursday, I argued that both Hillary Clinton and Sanders need to give plans for executive branch action, given gridlock in Congress. In response, on Twitter, some Sanders supporters said this was wrong: That Sanders--with a long career in lawmaking--could win Republican support; that Sanders would use the bully pulpit to rally voters; and that a Sanders win would necessarily bring the kind of wave that would give him votes for his policies. But this is blind to reality. Compromise is a distant shore. The Democratic Party has moved to the left, and the Republican Party has made a sharp turn to the right, guided by two generations of conservative revolutionaries, from Newt Gingrich to the Tea Party tidal wave of 2010. If you watched the Republican and Democratic debates back to back, you'd be forgiven for thinking they described two different countries. What's more, as demonstrated by the GOP presidential race--as well as the leadership fracas in the House of Representatives--many Republicans (57 percent, according to the Pew Research Center) reject compromise full stop. The world where Donald Trump and Ben Carson lead the GOP presidential race is not a world where Republican voters would support a Democratic president or assent to his policies. The presidency is polarizing. When you step onto its field, you become a polarized figure. Indeed, the ""bully pulpit"" does more to tear people apart than bring them together. For all of his legislative success, President Sanders would be just as divisive as President Obama, who was just as divisive as President Bill Clinton. You can't avoid this; it is baked into the cake of ideological politics. Conservatives are just as sincere with their beliefs as liberals. And they'll reject a Sanders agenda in the same way that liberals would reject Sen. Ted's Cruz's plans. If compromise is off the table, then what about the ""political revolution?"" It's possible. Sanders might bring a wave of new voters to the polls and secure Congress for Democrats. But as we saw with Obama, this gives you nothing in particular. The Democratic Party contains the vast majority of America's liberals, but it isn't a liberal party. It is a coalition of different groups and interests, from civil rights organizations and labor unions to banks, businesses, and countless voters spanning a massive country of distinct regions and areas. Sometimes, they hit the same notes and play the same song. But more often, they're discordant. There's no guarantee that a group of senators from states as different as New York, Massachusetts, Florida, North Carolina, and West Virginia will agree to vote with Sanders on breaking banks and creating free college education. Not because they're in league with oligarchs but because people--even people on the same side--disagree, and those people get a major say in how we run government. What happens to a Sanders agenda if he doesn't have a Democratic Congress? What happens if he has one but has to compromise to the bone to win? What happens if it fails? Sanders is a remarkable candidate who has inspired a lot of people to get involved and change the country. He's the first socialist to gain traction in national politics since the first half of the 20th century, and he disrupts the narrow scope for ideological debate in the United States. But he's also a politician, subject to the same forces as his peers, and neither he nor his allies can ignore the structural realities of American politics. If Sanders wants to be president, he needs a serious theory of change. Otherwise he'll flail--and he'll fail--and his supporters will wonder what happened."	"Why Bernie Sanders' ""Political Revolution"" Doesn't Have a Chance"
10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/hillary_clinton_would_make_a_better_president_than_bernie_sanders_the_democratic.html	"There's no question: Compared with Sen. Bernie Sanders', Hillary Clinton's agenda for the United States is less transformative, more incremental, and more committed to the status quo. Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate made this clear. Sanders wants free college education, funded by a tax on Wall Street transactions. Clinton, by contrast, wants a means-tested system for debt-free college. Students, under her plan, would still have to contribute to their education, either through work or other campus activities. Sanders wants to break up the largest banks, full stop. Clinton wants to focus federal attention on other major actors in the financial system and only break up big banks if they pose a risk. You can do this ad nauseum. Sanders says he wants to ""end institutional racism"" while Clinton commits to ""tackling mass incarceration"" and ""reforming criminal justice."" Sanders wants to ""expand Social Security"" for everyone--financed by lifting the cap on payroll taxes--while Clinton wants to improve it for the people who ""need it most."" You could read this contrast as a fundamental dispute over the nature of the American welfare state, and in extension, the future of American liberalism. But I wouldn't. Clinton and Sanders have serious differences, but on core issues of domestic politics--income redistribution, access to health care, immigration, civil rights, and the financial system--they're on the same side, moving in the same direction. And because Sanders is a ""democratic socialist""--basically someone in the mainstream of Western European politics--the practical difference, again, is of speed and scope. All of this is grist for partisans in both camps. Clinton supporters will shout down Sanders as ineffective (""We're progressives who get things done!"") while Sanders' allies will attack Clinton as a sellout to the rich and powerful. But if you ignore this conflict and widen your aperture, you'll see the degree to which both candidates are stuck in the same place, despite their competing labels and approaches. If either wins the White House, both Clinton's tortoise and Sanders' hare will run into the same obstacle--barring an unprecedented shift in the rules and conditions of American politics, there's no possible world in which they could achieve their core aims as president. Look at a map of U.S Senate and House races. Unless Democrats win in a landslide, the House will be controlled by the GOP through 2016 and into the next election cycle, if not beyond. At best, Democrats win the White House and the Senate, which leaves them where they were from 2011 until the end of 2014. Stuck. With a Democratic Senate and a Republican House, Congress won't move legislation except to fund the government and lift the debt ceiling (and given radical Republican intransigence, that's not a guarantee). If President Clinton or President Sanders wants to accomplish anything, she or he will have to use and utilize executive power, from filling the bureaucracy and stacking the courts to empowering Cabinet officials and shaping regulatory boards and agencies. This isn't small-ball politics. To the extent that President Obama is a success, it's almost despite his neglect of nominations, appointments, and bureaucracy. In his first term, Obama gave scant attention to vacancies on the federal judiciary and the Federal Reserve board. The latter, in particular, was a huge strategic mistake. Obama's neglect of the Fed--which has enormous influence over economic performance--narrowed his field of action on the economy, enabling mass unemployment and weak demand. Overall, Obama's poor management has led to a series of self-inflicted crises, from the Department of Veterans Affairs scheduling scandal to the Office of Personnel Management computer hack to the disastrous rollout of healthcare.gov. Twenty years ago, it was possible for a Democratic president to make law with a Republican Congress, or vice versa. Today, it's virtually impossible. The only way President Sanders or President Clinton will accomplish anything is through skilled use of bureaucratic power. So far, however, both candidates are silent on how they would act as an executive. Instead, both Clinton and Sanders are essentially running as legislative leaders, when the real challenge is how she or he would utilize the substantial power they have to direct and influence bureaucrats and regulators. That's not to say their rhetoric isn't important. That Sanders believes in a ""political revolution"" against money in politics tells you about his priorities as president. And Clinton's legislative incrementalism gives you a good signpost to how she'll work with Congress. But, the truth is that--in terms of writing new laws--both agendas are inert. They aren't passing Congress. Indeed, if Democrats hold the White House, they'll hold an inverse presidency of sorts. Like a second-term president, Clinton or Sanders will have to focus on executive power. To have legislative traction, she or he would have to wait for broader shifts to the electorate, as well as redistricting in 2020. It's only then that the big plans are plausible. So, what comes next? And, for Democratic primary voters, who is best equipped to be president in a time of gridlock, where the choice is executive action or nothing? Clinton's bureaucratic experience, her skill with partisan conflict, and her clear willingness to work against the spirit of the law--as illustrated by her State Department email controversy--make her a prime pick for this era of political grinding. To that point, on guns, Clinton has already vowed to take executive action to close a loophole that lets private brokers sell guns without giving a backgroound check to the buyer. But this brand of politics is hard and cynical, which is perhaps why Clinton can't build enthusiasm like Sanders, who has a positive vision for political life, even if it's unavoidably bound to structural realities. As for the GOP? It doesn't have this problem. Whether it's President Rubio or President Cruz, the Republican Party will have unified control of government. In which case, the question for voters--and for observers--is more existential than instrumental. Will this be the sober GOP of presidents past, or will it be a Freedom Caucus with power?

11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/democratic_presidential_candidates_have_a_strong_economic_message_their.html	"Tuesday night's Democratic presidential debate revealed much more than the state of the horse race. It didn't just pit Hillary Clinton against Sen. Bernie Sanders, or affect Vice President Joe Biden's decision about running, or introduce the other candidates. It framed the whole election. Democrats are putting together a case for jerking the leash on capitalism. It's moral, pragmatic, and smart. It fits the spirit of the times. Republicans had better come up with an answer. Traditionally, Republicans win elections by running against big government. This year's crop of Democrats seems a prime target, with a self-described socialist, Sanders, surging to the front of the pack. But it's not that simple. Early in Tuesday's debate, the moderator, CNN's Anderson Cooper, asked Sanders how a socialist could win the general election. And yet, an hour later, Cooper demanded to know why Sanders had voted against the Wall Street bailout. By that measure, Sanders is a purer capitalist than most Senate Republicans. The role of markets and government in a healthy economy is complicated. At one point in the debate, Cooper asked the candidates whether they believed in capitalism. Clinton replied that ""we would be making a grave mistake to turn our backs on what built the greatest middle class."" But ""what we have to do every so often,"" she argued, is to ""save capitalism from itself. ... It's our job to rein in the excesses of capitalism so that it doesn't run amok and doesn't cause the kind of inequities we're seeing."" That's a good summary of the Democrats' economic platform for 2016. Here are the details. 1. Respect moral boundaries. Republicans like to accuse Democrats of opposing free enterprise and morality. But in this debate, the Democratic candidates spoke of morality as a check on capitalism. ""What democratic socialism is about,"" Sanders declared, is ""that it is immoral and wrong that the top one-tenth of 1 percent in this country ... own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent."" Sanders invoked Pope Francis, asserting that ""we have a moral responsibility to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel ... and leave this planet a habitable planet for our children and our grandchildren."" The candidates also demanded other restraints on capitalism: a higher minimum wage, equal pay for women, and paid family and medical leave. 2. Measure the economy by welfare, not growth. Republicans say free-market policies produce economic growth. In the debate, the Democrats argued that this method of judging the economy, through aggregate statistics, is inadequate. ""You can have all of the growth that you want,"" said Sanders, ""and it doesn't mean anything if all of the new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent."" Clinton, Sanders, and Martin O'Malley, the former governor of Maryland, focused instead on stagnant middle-class incomes. They accused trade agreements of failing to raise wages or create good jobs in the United States. You can question their conclusions. But their standard of evaluation--looking at the distribution of wealth and income, not just the amount--is intuitively sound. 3. Disrupt concentrations of power. Republicans see big government as the main threat to freedom. Democrats see a different threat: big business. O'Malley warned that six banks now control 65 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product. Jim Webb, the former Virginia senator, said Wall Street now manages 55 percent of the world's capital. That degree of concentration creates several perils. One problem, articulated by Sanders, Clinton, and O'Malley, is that the biggest financial giants become too big to fail and should therefore be broken up. Another concern, raised by Sanders, is that communications companies acquire so much information about us that they rival the government as a threat to privacy. Sanders distinguished the evils of ""corporate America"" from our ""great entrepreneurial nation."" That's a common view on the American left: big business bad, small business good. 4. Limit corporate influence in politics. If the concentration of economic power in corporations is dangerous, then the ability of corporations to extend that power into politics multiplies the problem. It captures the one institution capable of checking these companies: the government. Webb raised this point, as did Sanders. ""Congress does not regulate Wall Street. Wall Street regulates Congress,"" said the Vermont senator. He also worried that another vehicle for public mobilization, the press, was incapacitated by ""the power of the corporate media."" 5. Protect Main Street from Wall Street. The candidates distinguished ""Main Street""--small, local companies that produce real goods or services--from ""Wall Street"" giants that buy or sell wagers on what will happen in the real economy. O'Malley and Sanders, playing on the debate's Las Vegas locale, accused the financial industry of ""casino"" capitalism. Three times, Clinton chastised Wall Street firms for ""speculative behavior."" The candidates agreed that banks shouldn't be allowed to engage in ""recklessness"" that exposed the public to high risk of economic contagion and a taxpayer-funded bailout. 6. Treat white-collar crime like street crime. Republicans like to campaign on law, order, and criminal justice. Now Democrats are using that theme, with executives as the villains. O'Malley often complains that nobody went to jail for the Wall Street crash. He asks how ""you can get pulled over for a broken tail light in our country, but if you wreck the world's economy you're somehow untouchable."" Tuesday night, Sanders expressed the same disbelief: ""We have a criminal justice system that lets CEOs on Wall Street walk away, and yet we are imprisoning or giving jail sentences to young people who are smoking marijuana."" Sanders even alleged that on Wall Street ""fraud is a business model."" Clinton raised the ante, boasting that her Wall Street reform plan ""would have the potential of actually sending the executives to jail."" 7. Wall Street owes Main Street. The Democrats' indictment doesn't just provide a villain. It provides a revenue stream. Since Main Street bailed out Wall Street, they argue, Wall Street owes Main Street a lot of money. This wasn't negotiated during the bailout, but Democrats want to extract the penalty retroactively. During the debate, Sanders said he'd fund universal college education through a ""tax on Wall Street speculation."" Webb advocated a ""windfall profits tax on the executives of any of these companies that got more than $5 billion"" in the bailout. ""Once they got their compensation and their bonus,"" Webb argued, these executives should have to ""split the rest of the money they made with the nurses and the truck drivers and the soldiers who bailed them out."" That's the Democrats' argument for 2016. Are they right? Personally, I'm more in line with the one Democratic candidate who didn't join in these attacks: former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee. Chafee, a longtime liberal Republican, left the GOP when the right wing took over. I like his penny pinching, and I'm skeptical of the promises I heard from the other Democrats: free college for everyone, more Social Security, and subsidized health care and higher education, even for undocumented immigrants. That's way too much spending to take on. But the Democrats' critique of capitalism? Basically, they've nailed it."	Why the Democrats' Economic Message Poses a Huge Challenge for Republicans
12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/cnn_debate_was_a_great_ad_for_the_democratic_party.html	"LAS VEGAS--Democratic Party officials and representatives in Las Vegas expressed plenty of optimism ahead of Tuesday night's debate, to the point that they seemed naive. These Democrats viewed the debate as a branding opportunity, a means of distancing the party from the foaming beast that emerges whenever Republican candidates gather to debate. The Democrats would spar and elucidate policy differences, but they would do so respectfully and without the interpersonal animus that's dominated the first two cluttered Republican stages. They would entertain, but through lively discussion--not through Trumpian suplexes or nativist bromides. It sounded fantastical and overly optimistic ahead of the debate. But it's basically what they got. Hillary Clinton was able not just to survive the debate, but prosper. She was still unable to coherently explain her recent decision not to support the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And her line about how she ""went to Wall Street in December of 2007 before the big crash that we had and I basically said, 'Cut it out,' "" was more than a little limp. But she was able to demonstrate her strength--her mastery of public policy details--and, thanks to her rival Bernie Sanders, she began putting the wreckage of her email fiasco behind her. She showed that there is, after all, a reason for the Democratic Party to line up behind her: Put in the right situations, she's pretty good at politics. Aside from a dreadful attempt to defend his history of voting against certain gun control measures, and one moment in which he appeared not to be paying attention to a conversation about Vladimir Putin, Sanders also prospered. He finally got his answer about Black Lives Matter down, and he seemed to genuinely understand that he had been wrong, previously, in relegating the concerns of racial justice activists. He weathered a fairly relentless assault from moderator Anderson Cooper over his self-identification as a ""democratic socialist."" (CNN telegraphed those questions in the runup to the debate by holding roughly 10 trillion pre-debate segments about the scandalous nature of Sanders' ideological description.) Martin O'Malley was able to ""introduce himself"" to the country in a positive light while jabbing when the moment called for it. He opened the debate in an uncomfortably slow, quiet voice, but demonstrated more passion and resolve when not letting Sanders off the hook during the exchange over gun control. O'Malley won't leap to the top of post-debate polls Wednesday morning. But he got the ""enhanced introduction"" he sought and justified his continued existence in the campaign. Meanwhile: Jim Webb whined about his lack of time too much but then said something funny and weird about killing a man, so he's OK. Lincoln Chafee was terrible, but at least he didn't get in the real candidates' way. Win! It was O'Malley who delivered the earnest wrapup that the Democratic National Committee wanted in his closing statement. ""On this stage, you didn't hear anyone denigrate women, you didn't hear anyone make racist comments about new American immigrants, you didn't hear anyone speak ill of another American because of their religious belief,"" he said, before concluding: ""That tells me we are moving to a more connected, generous, and compassionate place, and we need to speak to the goodness within our country."" O'Malley was in swell spirits afterward--though an interview with a Twitter troll in the hallway didn't help--and affirmed that he would continue his push to increase the number of debates from six. ""Didn't you think tonight was fun? Don't you think we should have more?"" he said, adding that he hoped Tuesday night's display would ""embolden"" those calling for more debates and persuade chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. We'll see. For all the optimism party leaders are feeling Tuesday night, not all debates will be this cuddly. The issue at hand is the compression of time. Part of the reason that Republican debates have been so vicious thus far--aside from Donald Trump's presence--is that candidates have more to prove before the mower comes their way, as it already did for Rick Perry and Scott Walker. The Democratic field is already small--pre-whittled, one might say. There's no rush. By the time Iowa and New Hampshire come around, though? Sanders may not be so willing to help Clinton out of her email situation. Wasserman Schultz surely understands this, even if she's incapable of explaining it properly. But for the first debate, the Democrats, as a body, did what they needed to do: made it through 21/2 hours without demonstrably wounding their collective cause.

14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/debbie_wasserman_schultz_doesn_t_want_to_talk_about_the_number_of_debates.html	"LAS VEGAS--It's the day of the first Democratic presidential debate, and all anyone wants to ask Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz is why there won't be that many more debates. The spat between Wasserman Schultz, whose DNC sanctioned six debates throughout the primary season, and her intraparty detractors ramped up this week. Lower-rung candidates like Martin O'Malley have been pressuring Wasserman Schultz for some time now to up the number of debates and eliminate the exclusivity rule, which penalizes candidates who participate in nonsanctioned debates. This week, just as Wasserman Schultz was trying to keep the attention focused on the candidates, their policies, and their national self-introductions, some kind of conflict broke out between Wasserman Schultz and a DNC vice chair, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. The two members of the party brass have differing recollections of what went down. Gabbard, who has been calling for more debates and implying that Wasserman Schultz runs the DNC with an unseemly, top-down approach, claimed that Wasserman Schultz disinvited her from tonight's debate as punishment for insubordination. A DNC spokeswoman and Wasserman Schultz denied this and claim that Gabbard's crusade for more debates was causing a ""distraction."" Which it almost certainly has been: a delicious, juicy distraction. Wasserman Schultz doesn't care for distractions, but reporters do, and reporters also love watching her get all bent out of shape flailing to stay on message. At a pre-debate roundtable event Tuesday in the Wynn Las Vegas with Nevada Democratic Party Chairwoman Roberta Lange and Nevada Rep. Dina Titus, Wasserman Schultz desperately tried to stay on her very serious message: how the cackling, evil Republicans plan to kill everyone, whereas the Democrats do not. After each of the panelists introduced themselves, Wasserman Schultz opened the room to questions. You'll never guess what the first question was. ""Congresswoman, can you explain to us what your staff might have told Congresswoman Gabbard in terms o--"" ""We're here to talk about the issues we've been talking about this afternoon,"" the chairwoman interjected, ""and so we're happy to take questions about that ... the focus of today is on our candidates, and that's what we're going to answer questions about."" Wasserman Schultz doesn't seem to be winning this PR war. If anything, her warning has only galvanized Gabbard to go on television as much as possible to continue the feud. ""It's not surprising to me that [Wasserman Schultz] is saying things that aren't true,"" Gabbard said in an interview Tuesday. The thing is, Wasserman Schultz doesn't seem to win many PR wars. That would seem to represent a gaping hole in the CV of the Democratic Party's chief spinster. All operatives spin, but the good ones are at least occasionally able to disguise their spinning. Wasserman Schultz is not one of the good ones. That said: She has thus far withstood significant pressure to increase the number of debates and not budged. Is there a way that could change tonight? The DNC certainly won't open the door to that possibility. But the DNC's job is to protect the Democratic nominee, and that is--still--Hillary Rodham Clinton. If this first debate gets unexpectedly frisky and Clinton can't hold her own, Schultz would probably not want to add several more. If it's calm and Clinton prospers, well, why not add more? That may not be the fairest way to think about it, but there doesn't seem to be much fairness in Debbie Wasserman Schultz's DNC."	Why Are the Democrats Having So Few Debates?
15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/lincoln_bedroom_guests_are_still_donating_to_hillary_clinton_many_of_bill.html	"For a first family, inviting guests to spend a night in the Lincoln Bedroom can pay dividends for decades. More than half of the donors who were overnight guests to Bill Clinton's White House are still giving--this time to Hillary Clinton. The Center for Public Integrity published the first list of donors who nabbed a night in the Clinton White House--and whose stays sparked outrage and investigations--in its 1996 report, ""Fat Cat Hotel."" Of the 66 original ""Fat Cats"" still living, 34 have donated a total of $1.15 million to Hillary Clinton's campaign or the super PACs supporting her since January 2013. With more than a year before the general election, the number of supporters and their donations will likely rise. Most of the generous former guests contributed $2,700 to Hillary Clinton's campaign account--the maximum amount allowed under federal law during the primaries. The Clinton campaign did not respond to a request for comment. At least one of the faithful 2016 givers, who celebrated his 10th wedding anniversary in 1993 with a stay at the White House, is looking forward to a return stay in the chief executive's mansion, courtesy of the Clintons. ""Last time I stayed in the Queen's bedroom, so I need to be upgraded to the Lincoln bedroom,"" said former Florida state Rep. Dick Batchelor, who orchestrated the first Florida fundraiser for Bill Clinton in 1991. ""I have no idea whether that would take place or not, but anybody who says they don't want to visit the White House and spend the night is probably not telling the truth. If I had an opportunity to go back, I would absolutely go back,"" he added. ""I need to return the towels."" The original 80 Fat Cats, including those who are now deceased, are only a portion of those who ultimately crashed at the Clinton White House. The Clinton administration released records in 1997 showing that 938 guests had stayed at the mansion during the president's first term, dwarfing the 284 who stayed during the previous administration. And a Democratic National Committee memo showed that President Bill Clinton personally endorsed the idea of using sleepovers at the White House as a fundraising tactic--""Ready to start overnights right away,"" he wrote. At least another 404 guests stayed the night at the Clinton White House and Camp David after Hillary Clinton began campaigning for U.S. Senate in July 1999. The invitations for sleepovers in the Lincoln Bedroom two decades ago drew fire during Clinton's presidency, as the press dug up details and Congress probed the chief executive's fundraising efforts. Many of the original Fat Cats were Clinton friends from Arkansas. But only eight of them have given to Hillary Clinton's campaign. Another 18 Arkansas friends have not, while 10 are no longer living. But that doesn't mean Arkansan attitudes toward Hillary Clinton have cooled, said Skip Rutherford, a longtime Clinton strategist and former White House overnight guest. ""The people that I know that were friends of Bill's are friends of Hillary's,"" said Rutherford, who said he hasn't contributed to politicians since becoming dean of the University of Arkansas Clinton School of Public Service. His wife, Billie, gave $2,700 to the 2016 Clinton campaign. ""Politics is very personal in this state. And the Clintons touched a lot of people over the years. And so there's a lot of loyal, good friends of the Clintons here."" There are some turncoats: At least four of the former Clinton guests, on top of turning lukewarm on Hillary Clinton, have contributed to her Republican rivals for the nation's highest office. Texas oil magnate Truman Arnold, who served as finance chair for the Democratic Party in 1995 and has contributed to Democrats as recently as last year, gave $25,000 to Right to Rise USA, a super PAC backing former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Arnold, who was in charge of Democratic fundraising in his role as finance chair, was caught up in the Lincoln Bedroom scandal as more than just a guest. He once told journalists that he used a Clinton White House database to make sure donors were rewarded with perks, including Lincoln Bedroom stays. Arnold did not respond to requests for comment. Little Rock bank executive Curt Bradbury and his wife Charlotte both gave to the campaign of Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina; in addition, Curt Bradbury gave $25,000 to a super PAC supporting New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and $100,000 to the pro-Bush super PAC Right to Rise USA. Bradbury said staying in the White House was ""a little bit like sleeping in a museum."" Though he's a lifelong conservative, he supported Bill Clinton because he is a ""native son"" of Arkansas. ""Bill's politics in Arkansas don't resemble anything I see in the Democratic Party now,"" he said. ""He was very pragmatic in Arkansas."" Arkansas banker Warren Stephens, who has given mostly to Republicans but supported Bill Clinton's first bid for the presidency, has contributed more than $216,000 to support the presidential bids of several candidates, including Bush, Christie, Graham and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who has since dropped out of the race. ""The entire Democrat party has shifted pretty hard to the left,"" Stephens said. ""Our politics are a lot different."" Several of the Hollywood honchos who once stayed at the Clinton White House have donated to Hillary Clinton, but others have yet to commit. Director Steven Spielberg gave $1 million to a super PAC supporting the former secretary of state, as well as $2,700 to her campaign. And actor Tom Hanks, singer Barbra Streisand, producer David Geffen, and actress Mary Steenburgen also supported the former first lady's 2016 run. ""I don't think there's a human being in this world more qualified because of all of her experiences,"" Steenburgen, an Arkansas native, told the Arkansas Times earlier this year. She has given $2,700 to the campaign fund. ""I will be campaigning mightily."" But comedian Chevy Chase, actor Richard Dreyfuss, and producer Mike Medavoy have not given. Medavoy, who supported Obama during the 2008 presidential primaries, said he plans to give soon. ""I will contribute at the time of my choosing,"" he said. ""When is none of your business."" Some of the former guests who have not yet donated to the Clinton 2016 effort may be waiting for the Democratic Party to choose a nominee. Others said they plan to give soon. ""Well of course I support Hillary because I'm crazy about her,"" said Diane Carroll, whose husband Phillip Carroll once worked with the candidate at the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock. ""I just haven't really gotten around to it, to tell you the truth."" This story was published by the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative news organization in Washington."	Former Lincoln Bedroom Guests Are Hoping for a Return Visit--in Hillary's White House
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/the_debt_ceiling_deadline_is_coming_fast_can_john_boehner_paul_ryan_or_someone.html	"It's finally clear why Rep. Paul Ryan changed his mind and chose to run for speaker. He wasn't interested in the fundraising, traveling, or the time away from his kids. He also wasn't much interested in having to twist the arms of characters like Reps. Louie Gohmert and Steve King late into the night. What changed his mind, surely, was a glance at the calendar: Ryan will only have to serve as speaker for a handful of days before the apocalypse will arrive and our institutions will cease to exist. The debt ceiling deadline has been moved up two days to Nov. 3, according to the most recent estimate from Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. That is 11 days from now and considerably fewer legislative days. So far the House hasn't moved a bill, and neither has the Senate. There's another problem emerging in the House of Representatives, too, if you can believe it: The votes supposedly aren't there. And we don't just mean that a majority of Republicans aren't willing to raise the debt ceiling. That's never the case. Instead, it's that even if Speaker Boehner/Ryan were to call up a ""clean"" debt ceiling increase with no conditions attached, and even if such a bill got unanimous Democratic support, there still wouldn't be enough Republicans to vote for it. Or so they say. Buried relatively deeply on Politico's front page, beneath stories about Benghazi and the Jeb Bush campaign's pay cuts, is a piece about how we are a handful of legislative days from surpassing our statutory borrowing limit and no one is doing anything. Earlier this week the plan was to pass a stringent Republican Study Committee-backed bill that would have frozen all new regulations, among other deliciously fantastical conservative goodies. But GOP leaders have backed away because even that did not have enough support among Republicans. Since the conservative debt ceiling bill was never going anywhere in the Senate and apparently isn't going anywhere in the House either, can we just skip to the part where Boehner passes a clean bill with mostly Democratic votes? Nope. ""Boehner, McCarthy and other GOP leaders are refusing at this point to move ahead with a 'clean' debt ceiling bill insisted on by President Barack Obama,"" Politico reports. ""Senior leadership aides said they couldn't find the 30 Republican votes needed to join with all 188 Democrats to pass that proposal--a bleak indication of the current state of play."" The math problem at hand is a fitting epitaph for the Boehner era: The Republican pickups in the 2014 election have made it harder for Boehner to do his job. As the Atlantic's Russell Berman explains, ""Because Republicans expanded their majority last year, there are fewer Democrats in the House, and several more GOP lawmakers would need to vote yes for the bill to pass."" The Republican speaker's job was a hell of a lot easier when he didn't have to deal with quite so many Republicans. But let's not take Boehner and company's complaints about how they simply don't have the votes as the final word. He must find the votes. Congress last passed a ""clean"" debt ceiling increase in early 2014 with few votes to spare, 221 to 201. Democrats provided 193 of those votes, Republicans 28--and a third of those Republican members are no longer in Congress. Now the House has 188 Democratic members. If all of them vote for the clean increase this time, 30 of the 247 Republican members--meaning the 18 members who voted for it last time plus 12 new ones--must join in on the fun. (That's assuming everyone shows up. In the 2014 hike, 10 members did not cast a ballot, so only 212 votes were needed to pass it. Perhaps some folks would like to take the day off again? ) Boehner says that he doesn't have the 30 votes. ""Not having the votes,"" however, doesn't mean that Boehner can't go out there and get them. That only 28 Republicans voted for the increase last year did not mean that the maximum number of willing Republicans was 28. More likely, the vote count crossed the threshold for passage and remaining members took their free ""no"" vote. That's why Democrats aren't sweating it too much just yet. ""Crocodile tears,"" a senior Democratic Senate aide tells Slate about Boehner's complaint that he doesn't have the votes for a clean bill. ""They'll find the votes. The math on 28 minus 9--or whatever it is--is based on a flawed premise. There were only 28 votes last time because there only needed to be 28 votes--once the threshold was reached, they let people go who were in reserve."" Let's hope that's true, and that Boehner is able to pass the ""clean"" bill next week as his last act of responsible leadership. If he doesn't, well, maybe the apocalypse won't be as bad as they say it is."	The Debt Ceiling Deadline Is Coming Fast. What Can Be Done?
17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/the_benghazi_hearing_was_a_self_destructive_partisan_embarrassment_for_the.html	"For three years, Republicans have struggled to find a political scandal in the 2012 attack that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans in Benghazi, Libya. First came an investigation by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Then an investigation by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Then more probes by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, the House Judiciary Committee, the House Armed Services Committee, and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. When those inquiries failed to implicate Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state during the attack and is now the Republicans' main target in the 2016 presidential race, the GOP created one more investigative unit: the House Select Committee on Benghazi. The select committee, Republicans figured, would finally nail Clinton. It scrapped plans to publicly interrogate other officials. It subpoenaed Clinton's emails and deposed her aides. Gradually, the GOP's fixation on her became the story. Three weeks ago, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy boasted that the committee's investigation had driven down Clinton's poll numbers. Then a former Republican staffer on the committee said he had been fired for refusing to focus on Clinton. Thursday was the committee's big day. The panel called one witness, Clinton, and interrogated her for 11 hours. The committee's Republicans promised a decisive confrontation, and they delivered it. But it wasn't Clinton who unraveled. It was the Republicans. The committee's chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, started with a defensive speech. Alluding to the seven previous investigations, he declared again and again that ""this committee is the first committee"" to obtain new information the others had missed. Then he turned on his Democratic colleagues:"	The Spectacular, Self-Destructive, Partisan Embarrassment of the Benghazi Hearing
18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/hillary_clinton_won_the_benghazi_hearing.html	"The most honest moment of Hillary Clinton's hearing before the House Select Committee on Benghazi came toward the end of its third hour. ""Those who want to believe the worst will believe the worst. Those that want to believe this is a partisan exercise will believe it,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff. He's right. If you don't like Clinton--if you think she's a liar and a disgrace--then this hearing doesn't matter. It changes nothing. And if you think this is a farce--an ""abusive effort"" to derail Clinton's presidential campaign--you'll walk away unmoved. Still, it's possible to judge and evaluate a performance. Ignoring our baked-in reactions to either Clinton or House Republicans, how have both sides fared in this long-form exercise in political theater? The GOP's job was simple: Try as hard as possible to dispel the belief that the Benghazi committee is a partisan witch hunt, as it was essentially described in an unintentionally revealing moment by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. To do that, GOP members had to keep calm, stay sober, and approach Clinton as determined but ultimately fair-minded investigators. For the first hour, they succeeded. Chairman Trey Gowdy was measured and serious, if defensive about his committee--""Not a single member of this committee signed up to investigate you or your email""--while Rep. Peter Roskam of Illinois, who followed Gowdy's opening statement, asked careful questions aimed at establishing Clinton's role in building the administration's policy in Libya. So far, so good. By the next hour, however, Republican propriety fell apart. During a testy back-and-forth with Clinton, Rep. Mike Pompeo of Kansas condemned her for lack of visible accountability in the State Department's handling of security in Benghazi. ""How come not a single person lost a single paycheck connected to the fact that we had the first ambassador killed since 1979? How come no one has been held accountable to date?"" he said. ""Well, congressman, the Accountability Review Board pointed out several people working in the State Department who they thought had not carried out their responsibilities adequately, but they said they could not find a breach of duty,"" Clinton replied. When Pompeo couldn't get the answer he wanted, he moved to another claim--that the State Department was meeting with al-Qaida fighters in Libya. ""[Y]our officials were meeting with this man on the ground in Benghazi, Libya, discussing security,"" he said. When Clinton couldn't give an answer on who those officials were--she wasn't aware of the meeting--he yielded his time. It was unclear if Clinton was caught or if Pompeo knew he couldn't deliver the goods, but it didn't appear to hurt her. Later in the hearing, after the break, Pompeo would press Clinton on her relationship to Ambassador Christopher Stevens--who was killed in the attack--versus her relationship with Sidney Blumenthal, a longtime ally. Did Stevens have her personal email address? Her home address? Pompeo also pressed Clinton for her approach to management: Why, as the chief diplomat responsible for thousands of employees and facilities, wasn't she involved in managing each aspect of embassy security? Likewise, in a similarly long but fruitless exchange, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio indulged a whole host of breathless--and debunked--claims about Clinton's involvement in Benghazi: that Clinton lied about protests, that she lied about the relevancy of an anti-Muslim video that had sparked an uproar in the Middle East, and that she attempted to cover up crucial information. This had a rhythm: Jordan would bark a question, Clinton would try to answer, and Jordan would interrupt her. By the end, she was clearly bored and contemptuous of the exchange. But this was just a preview of the worst moment of the first three hours. Before the hearing broke for its lunch break, Gowdy--after denying that the committee was a ""prosecution""--asked aggressive questions about Clinton and her relationship to Blumenthal: whether she solicited his advice, where he got his information on Libya, and why she passed his emails on to others. For a committee ostensibly about the attacks in Benghazi, it was an unusual exchange, made worse when Rep. Elijah Cummings--the ranking Democratic member--demanded that Gowdy release the full transcripts of Blumenthal's testimony, sparking a loud and bitter fight over the direction of the hearing between the two men. Even for this Congress--among the most unpopular in recent history--it was embarrassing. Which brings us to Hillary Clinton's performance. At times, she stumbled. Pompeo's questioning, for instance, was well-structured, and it's almost a guarantee that Clinton's claims of ignorance with regard to meetings in Libya will find themselves into campaign advertisements. Overall, however, Clinton was strong. Throughout, she showed her clear knowledge of foreign policy questions, defended the administration and her tenure at the State Department, and laid out her vision for how American diplomacy should operate:"	The Benghazi Hearing Was Supposed to Hurt Hillary's Campaign.

""KING PAUL: PLEDGE YOUR ALLEGIANCE"" is how the always cool-tempered conservative linker Matt Drudge treated the news. Others considered an additional set of demands he might put forth in the style of a celebrity's backstage rider. Sure, some of the demands seemed more superfluous than others. He wants to work a relatively normal workday--no constant traveling to raise money so that he can spend more time raising his children. Well, fine. They can always lie to him about how he'll never have to work late in order to get him to accept the job. But the central demands--demand, really--that he's putting forth is about more than an individual's whims. It's a question he's posing directly to the Freedom Caucus and the conservative radicals who prop them up: Can a Republican majority smoothly govern the House of Representatives, or not? Ryan isn't making demands upfront just to protect his leisurely deer-hunting lifestyle. He's setting a marker of what's required to repair the House under its current composition, and he's leaving the Freedom Caucus with the bag. Ryan has given GOP factions until Friday to decide whether they'll support him, so that gives conservative media a precious couple of days to convince Freedom Caucus members to screw everything up. They're off to a hot start. Conservative talker Laura Ingraham said on her Wednesday program, flat-out, that ""Paul Ryan should not be Speaker of the House ... find someone who won't stick his or her finger into the eye of the electorate."" The similarly influential talker Mark Levin has been railing against Ryan as a tool of the same nefarious Republican establishment that insists on transferring American culture and sovereignty into the hands of undocumented immigrants. According to National Review's reporting, Ryan allegedly offered conservatives a pledge not to call up a comprehensive immigration reform bill, as if there was a chance in hell of that ever happening anytime soon. If true, Levin and Ingraham will have to find some other line of argument, real or fabricated, to deploy against Ryan. I doubt they'll have much trouble. Ryan's pitch doesn't seem to be going well among Freedom Caucus members themselves, either. Ryan's central demand is a rule change that weakens the motion to vacate the speaker's chair--i.e., allows the speaker to do his job without constant threat of a coup. This is the tactic that conservatives were threatening to deploy against House Speaker John Boehner before he beat them to the punch with the classic you can't fire me, I quit! maneuver. Conservatives are responding to this condition in their trademarked calm, cool, and measured way: by running around screaming about Thomas Jefferson. ""The demands to change Jefferson's rules on the motion to vacate the chair seems kind of arcane, but I think it has worked since 1801 so I think that should probably not be changed,"" said Rep. Tim Huelskamp, one of those members who--to put it euphemistically--is always good for a quote. ""If it was good enough for Thomas Jefferson I think it is good enough for us."" This Ryan guy thinks he's better than Tom Jefferson, does he? Huelskamp added that he ""never thought Paul Ryan would come in and say, 'I want more power than John Boehner has.' "" These are the sort of dolts that Ryan is trying to convince: Adults who honestly believe that Boehner had power over them, rather than the other way around. As I wrote when Ryan was first considering taking the role, Ryan needed to make these sorts of conditions. There's no point in either him or anyone else serving as speaker if they don't, and he is supposedly the only member with enough cross-factional credibility to compel them into agreeing. If House conservatives don't accede to Ryan's terms, the next speaker will be one of two types: someone who gives the Freedom Caucus whatever they want, which ultimately means more brush-ins with government shutdowns and debt ceiling breaches, or someone who can pull together a coalition of Republicans and Democrats. The latter would quite obviously represent the natural will of the House, but it also clashes with the current era of partisan polarization: It's hard to see many Republicans voting for a speaker who cuts a deal with Nancy Pelosi. And the former just represents a continuation of the dysfunctional Boehner-era dynamics, with a figure who will be on a shorter leash than he ever was. Ryan's candidacy, under Ryan's terms, marks the only hope for a barely functional House of Representatives for at least the remainder of the Obama administration. Sounds like a good deal to most members, but perhaps not the procedural radicals who must decide."	Why Paul Ryan Is Right to Play Hardball
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/mike_murphy_jeb_bush_problem_the_head_of_right_to_rise_can_t_explain_how.html	"Mike Murphy finds it all very funny that people think Jeb Bush is in trouble. The head of Bush's $100 million super PAC, Right to Rise, considers most political punditry this cycle to be stupid. Conceded. But both the stupid and occasional non-stupid pundits all agree on one thing: Things aren't going well for Bush, and one cannot assume that the old rules governing Republican presidential nominating contests will inevitably save him. Murphy outlined his thinking in a rare extended interview with Bloomberg Politics. Why? Most practically, to signal Right to Rise's thinking to the official Bush campaign and leery donors. Or, in Murphy's words: ""[W]e thought it would be good to kind of go through our theory of the race in a more distributed way."" His theory is lacking. Nowhere, between all his mockery, does he get to the heart of the matter: why people don't like Jeb Bush right now, and how Right to Rise intends to change that. ""What I find is we're in this funny casino of the pre-season now,"" he says, ""where the complete sum of pundit knowledge in this race, with a few rare exceptions, is based on national polling that in my view is completely meaningless."" Zuh? There will always be a fair share of bad national poll coverage. If there's more of it this time, Murphy can blame the Republican National Committee and its media partners for pegging debate participation to national polling status. But it's not like Bush is only doing badly in national polls that don't matter, anyway. He's doing poorly in polls of early states, too. Bush is doing lousy in Iowa. That's fine: Bush is one thing and Iowa Republicans are a whole other thing. But he's also performing lousy in New Hampshire, a state he has spent an extraordinary amount of time in and has been advertising in. He is not leading in Florida, his natural firewall, or South Carolina, the GOP establishment's traditional firewall for their chosen representative. How important are early state polls? They can and do fluctuate along with everything else. Murphy, whether he means to or not, implies that early state polls are important, because he dramatically lowers Bush's expectations in those early states based on how poorly things have been going. That, as the Washington Post's David Weigel points out, is really the most eye-popping exchange in the interview: Murphy argues that Bush doesn't need to win any states for the first 45 days of contests in order to win the nomination--people will know that he has the money to compete for the long haul, the ""little guys"" will flame out, and then the real race will begin later on in big-state, winner-take-all races. It's an arguable theory. Murphy is not the first to suggest that super PACs like his extend the primary map and downplay the traditional importance of the early states. But Murphy is supposed to be the one arguing that, writ-large, the old rules of nominating--in which party voters eventually ditch flings and flock to the more electable, ""establishment"" pick--still apply. Arguing that the eventual nominee need not win (or even place!) in Iowa, New Hampshire, or South Carolina this time around punctures his underlying premise--that this time isn't all that different. This is second-order stuff, anyway. Whether the rules are different or not, the central problem for Bush is the same: Voters simply do not care for him. Being relatively liked by human beings who vote in elections is an important first step toward winning elections. We need not pay much attention to Bush's top-line number in national polls, but we can look to his favorability ratings to see what sort of space he has to work with. Monmouth University's latest national poll, released this morning, finds Bush at 5 percent nationally. Whatever. Skip to the favorability ratings, though, and the picture somehow looks even more grim. Of the six candidates' whose favorables were polled among Republicans, Bush is the only one underwater--at 37 to 44 percent. This is indicative of the trend, and it corresponds with what any person paying vague attention to the news has seen. Murphy is just spinning, same as anyone else who works for Bush. Of course there are going to be some gaps in what he says versus what is really happening. But if he's going to prattle on about how the media has invented a sorry state of affairs for Bush's candidacy that isn't backed by evidence, well, we hate to break it to him. If anything, the media has given Bush too much credit due to his last name and his family's reputation for winning presidential nominations. Who in their right mind would believe that this visibly poor campaigner, who's fifth-placing it every which way, whose fundamentals show little room for growth, who's out-of-step with the temperament of his party's voters, whose cash advantage isn't really in another league anymore, and whose general election viability isn't looking so hot is going to be restored by the natural laws of presidential nominating? Only the stupid, stupid media would believe that this guy has a shot."	The One Problem the Head of Bush's Super PAC Can't Solve
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/conservatives_don_t_want_filibuster_reform_what_happens_when_conservative.html	"So much of the frustration that's led to the current state of tumult in the House of Representatives can be traced to the continued existence of the Senate's legislative filibuster. While the 40 or so House conservatives--the so-called Freedom Caucus--who refuse to bow to any potential leader right now paint their objections in terms of ""fight"" or ""spine,"" the bigger problem is math: None of their high-profile partisan bills can escape Congress because of the Senate's 60-vote procedural rule. Even without that rule, plenty of these bills would still earn a veto from the president. But moving a funding bill written on conservatives' terms out of Congress would at least apply more pressure on the president to sign it. And more importantly, in the not-so-distant future: If Republicans can retain control of Congress in 2016 while picking up the White House, the legislative filibuster will be their only impediment--and if it isn't reformed, the source of unthinkable rage among the grassroots right. Which makes it so peculiar that some of the conservatives who complain most about the lack of fight in their leaders are the most hesitant to reform the filibuster. Tedious people frequently describe Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as a Senate ""institutionalist."" As if the senior senator from Kentucky licks the well of the chamber clean each night before retiring to bed in his Henry Clay-themed pajamas and nightcap. A more apt label for McConnell would be ""master political operator who robotically follows whatever path political incentives have laid out for him."" It wasn't a very ""institutionalist"" move, for example, to decide in 2009 to filibuster every agenda item congressional Democrats and the Obama administration could conceive of. In terms of scorched-earth partisan politics, though, it was an extremely effective procedural innovation--so successful that his Democratic counterpart, Sen. Harry Reid, has deployed the filibuster just the same way, and with just as much success, since his ""demotion"" to minority leader. So give McConnell some credit: The institutionalist made it a full nine months as Senate majority leader before changing his tune on filibuster reform. Perhaps recognizing that grassroots conservatives would be coming for his head after lopping off John Boehner's, McConnell last week blessed a new ""special task force to explore changes to the filibuster rule and other procedural hurdles--including whether to eliminate filibusters on motions to proceed to legislation,"" the Hill reported. A mix of Senate Republican veterans and freshmen will constitute this blue-ribbon commission. One would have expected rejoicing in the streets from conservative movementarians that McConnell had finally opened the door to eliminating the obnoxious 60-vote rule that he himself perfected, under a different set of circumstances, a few short years ago. Instead, one of the first statements that came out of the conservative pressure-group world was a scream from FreedomWorks, the Tea Party-aligned group, arguing against any changes to the filibuster. ""The Senate is supposed to be the 'world's greatest deliberative body,' but any weakening of the filibuster will lead us further down a slippery slope where reactionary policies are rammed through the chamber without any serious debate,"" FreedomWorks legislative affairs manager Josh Withrow said. ""Simply put, the Senate is the last check on impulsiveness and majority rule. Limiting the profound deliberation for which the chamber is known will come back to haunt Republicans should they once again become the chamber's minority party."" That is the conservative position in its most traditional sense: If the ideological purpose is to slow federal lawmaking to a halt, then the filibuster is conservatives' best friend. These are precisely the terms with which another surprising filibuster reform opponent, Sen. Ted Cruz--who sees each mathematical impossibility as one that must be ""fought"" against--describes his position. ""The legislative filibuster slows down legislative action in the Senate,"" Cruz told reporters in September, ""and I believe that, over time, protects human liberty by slowing down the expansion of government."" An interesting theory of politics. But here's another one: The filibuster is super annoying, and conservatives have a lot they'll want to get done under a hypothetically Republican president and Congress in 2017. If they want to repeal Obamacare and cut individual tax rates by trillions of dollars, they will either need to come up with the most creative budget reconciliation package of all time, or they will need to carve up the filibuster. The question of what is to be done about the filibuster puts conservative ideology and conservative practice in pursuit of ideological ends in direct conflict. ""Over time,"" as Cruz says, conservatives believe that a better-greased pathway for legislation leads to bigger, bloated government. But conservatives also believe that serious conservative legislation rolling back the liberal achievements of the Obama administration (and Johnson and Roosevelt administrations) is needed immediately to save America from financial ruin, tyranny, famine, the apocalypse of liberty, and what have you. Which side will prevail? Well, think for a second about how angry the conservative base is at the lack of progress on their issues right now, and then consider how they might react to a Republican Congress and White House telling them, in 2017, that they can't pass anything because of this one Senate rule that they're capable of eliminating at any time."	How Hardcore Conservatives Came to Love the Filibuster
23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/jeb_bush_and_marco_rubio_arguing_over_campaign_fundraising_neither_florida.html	"The mother and the disloyal cub of the 2016 Republican presidential nomination race are at it again. Florida men Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio are effectively in the same fundraising position according to their third-quarter filings--a not-great one--but neither of them want you to focus on that. Rubio raised about $5.7 million in the third quarter to Bush's $13.4 million. But those sums don't need to worry anyone. ""Thanks to smart budgeting and fiscal discipline,"" Rubio's campaign announced, ""Marco Rubio for President started October with more money in the bank than Jeb Bush for President and most other campaigns."" That's kinda-sorta true. Rubio is touting $10.9 million on-hand to Bush's $10.3. But that Rubio figure includes ""about $1.2 million in general election funds"" that can't be used until he is certified as the nominee. So in terms of primary funds, Jeb Bush is the Big Winner by a few hundred grand. Fine. That's one weak shot from the Rubio camp. On the other side, we have Bush's son, Jeb Jr., telling Rubio to ""kind of, like, dude, you know, either drop out or do something."" (When asked about whether the senator would heed John Ellis Bush Jr.'s call to drop out of the presidential race, Rubio campaign spokesman Alex Conant had no comment.) What's with the lame attacks? Bush prattles on about how Rubio is young and misses votes. Rubio says that Bush is old and has marginally less cash on hand than he does, even though he doesn't really. (It's tickling every time Rubio's campaign brags about how frugal it is--flying commercial, staying at mediocre hotels, etc. Pre-empting the avalanche of ads about Rubio's fun history with credit cards, much?) These are the two lead ""establishment"" candidates for the Republican presidential nomination. Let's get past the slappy nonsense and cut to the part where they accuse each other of fathering children out-of-wedlock or secretly murdering people. What the bickering on Q3 Fundraising Release Day does achieve, though, is a mutually beneficial distraction from a larger problem: Neither of these campaigns is in particularly great shape moneywise. The roughly $10 million that Rubio and Bush each have on hand is less than that of Sen. Ted Cruz and Ben Carson, candidates that are Not Supposed to Win. And none of the candidates' cash-on-hand totals are anywhere near the hauls of either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders ($33 million and $27 million, respectively). More troubling is Bush and Rubio's mutual reliance on big donors for their sums. Rubio raised 21 percent of his $5.7 million third-quarter sum from donations of $200 or less, while Bush raised a comical 7 percent of his $13.7 million from the same group. (Clinton only raised 17 percent of her sum from small donors, too, but at least she was able to shake out her wealthy cohort's pockets for a significantly larger haul.) Reliance on big donors, for one thing, requires a higher cost of fundraising: They like to be treated to fancy booze and only the choicest steaks in luxury homes and hotels, to which the candidate has to fly, before sending in their $2,700 checks. Small donors just go to a website. And if you rely on donors who max out early, that limits your pool of people who can continue donating as the primary goes on. (That's one reason that Barack Obama was able to outlast Clinton in 2008. And though her competition isn't as strong this time, Clinton risks falling into the same trap.) Maybe there's a million-person mass that is just waiting for the right moment to dump individually modest, collectively large sums of cash into Bush and Rubio's coffers. But maybe not? The Republican thinking going into this race was that many core operations traditionally performed by official campaigns would be ""outsourced"" to super PACs. To be sure, the top GOP candidates aren't having any trouble raising super PAC cash. But the first two dropouts, Rick Perry and Gov. Scott Walker, showed early in the process the pitfalls of leaning too much on the unlimited-fund receptacles. Both candidates' super PACs had tens of millions of dollars in the bank when their horses quit, and their horses quit because they dried out of hard cash. In Walker's case particularly, he assumed that his campaign fundraising would be commensurate with his super PAC fundraising, and he built a costly campaign operation based on that mistake. That left him extremely vulnerable to the whims of hard-money cash flow. When it slowed, he was finished. Republican super PACs were supposed to have learned in the 2012 election that it's wiser to spend more relatively on building up grassroots networks in critical states than on television ads. Well, Bush's main super PAC, Right to Rise, has already booked $56 million worth of ad buys through the early part of next year. If Republican voters ever start liking Bush, that bombardment will help him fend off challengers in the primary. But the prioritization of ads will also leave him woefully lacking in on-the-ground organizational structure heading into a general election. It's no wonder that Bush and Rubio spent the latter end of this week bickering with each other about whose money pile was bigger. Because neither of them were that big, and if they're not careful, they could find themselves in a position next year where they need cash that's just not there."

25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/why_nevada_is_crucial_for_hillary_clinton_the_early_primary_state_may_be.html	"LAS VEGAS--The Nevada Democratic Party had just awarded half of its delegates to Miss Piggy. On the eve of the first Democratic debate, the party was hosting a mock caucus to train precinct workers at its offices in Las Vegas. Thirty-five local volunteers took part in the program and were remunerated with pizza for their time. Things might have gotten a little frisky had the party used real candidates for its demonstration--a party training exercise is not the right venue for a war of words over Hillary Clinton versus Bernie Sanders--so instead it opted for characters from The Muppets. After the first ballot, 15 participants had gone with Miss Piggy (an assertive leader) while eight caucused for Kermit the Frog. ""Uncommitted"" took eight--twice as many as the irreverent Fozzie Bear, who was deemed unviable for the next round. Piggy was the victor and scooped up the lion's share of proportionally allotted delegates. After the event, Nevada Democratic Party chairwoman Roberta Lange gave the group more information about the demographic makeup of the delegates it would send to the convention. The party's goal, she said, is to send seven black, nine Hispanic, one Native American, three Asian and Pacific Islander, four LGBTQ, five disabled, and 12 ""youth"" representatives to express the diversity of Nevada Democrats--one that closely resembles the national Democratic coalition that took shape under President Obama's stewardship. That's why Democrats in Nevada, which is already the third state to select its delegates, think they should lead the Democratic primary process: They're more representative of the contemporary party base than their Democratic counterparts in Iowa and New Hampshire. ""We're kind of a harbinger for what's happening in the West,"" Rep. Dina Titus, whose district represents much of Las Vegas, said in her thick twang. ""And our population is so heterogeneous--fastest-growing Asian population, big Hispanic population--our face is the face of America. So what we're saying here is what the rest of the country's thinking."" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, as he is known to do, put the pitch for Nevada a bit more curtly Monday night. Speaking with the Washington Post's Paul Kane at an MGM Grand gathering, Reid declared that if ""you go to New Hampshire, there aren't any minorities there, nobody lives there. You go to Iowa, and there are a few people there. But again, it is a place that does not demonstrate what America is all about, for a lot of different reasons."" Reid has never much cared about hurting people's feelings, and now that he's retiring, he really doesn't care. You could see the delight in his face the following day when, at a pre-debate press conference at the Wynn, he answered New Hampshire Democrats' call for an apology: ""New Hampshire is heavily populated and loaded with minorities,"" he said, grinning. ""So I apologize."" Reid himself knows that the state's high percentage of Hispanics--nearly 28 percent of the population, compared with the 17 percent national average--can sway the state one way or another. Despite horrible approval ratings, Reid's 2010 re-election campaign was able mobilize the state's Hispanic voters through his push for the Dream Act and, later, immigration reform. Nevada's Democratic power fuses new demographic advantages with a more traditional element of the party base: labor unions. Workers along the Strip and Las Vegas' greater tourist industry are well-organized, in spite of the state's right-to-work law. The Culinary Workers Union Local 226 boasts more than 55,000 members in Nevada and is now locked in a fight to organize workers in one of Las Vegas's tallest hotels: the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas. Trump's very tall, very classy, very fake-golden-looking footprint in Vegas lorded over the nearby Wynn, which was hosting the Democratic debate, fulfilling Trump's every dream. Unfortunately for him, the Culinary Workers are smart, and they recognized that it could be useful to have a big protest rally outside his hotel while most of the country's political reporters were in town--as well as the Democratic front-runner. For Hillary Clinton, the opportunity to appear at a rally outside Donald Trump's hotel with a powerful union that represents many Hispanic workers and whose endorsement might be handy was worth interrupting her debate prep. ""Mr. Trump says, 'Make America great again,' "" she said. ""Well, the Trump workers say, 'Start here.' "" Well, it's the appearance that counts. Clinton barely won the Nevada caucus vote in 2008. (It was her only caucus win in a campaign that infamously blew off caucus states in its nomination strategy.) It's hard to see how she would lose it this time. A CNN/ORC poll released this week showed Clinton leading Sen. Bernie Sanders 50 to 34 percent in Nevada; when Vice President Joe Biden isn't included, she shoots to 58 percent to Sanders' 36. Like the South Carolina primary that follows, Nevada's will test the biggest question mark in this race: whether Sanders, or anyone else, can drain Clinton's strong leads among minority voters. If Clinton can maintain those advantages, and earn the backing of Nevada's labor unions, she'll run away with the third voting state. According to the campaign's Nevada spokesman, Clinton has 22 paid staff and 3,200 volunteers spread across its Reno and Las Vegas offices. Clinton has also been making friendly (if not entirely convincing) overtures to labor in recent weeks, calling for a repeal of the Affordable Care Act's ""Cadillac tax"" on pricy health care plans and coming out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. It wasn't the Culinary Workers' endorsement she received Wednesday. But Clinton was able to announce a separate union endorsement at a training facility for the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades in Henderson, Nevada. After taking a tour of the facility, smiling politely as craftspeople shared the knowledge of their trade, Clinton--backed by a dozen or so trainees, who may or may not have been eager to participate--gave a brief speech outlining the economic message she's tailored for Nevada. Noting that the Las Vegas region was the ""epicenter of the mortgage crisis and the foreclosure crisis"" from which it's still, slowly, recovering, Clinton segued to the need for skilled jobs properly organized under labor unions. ""I'm feeling really lucky in Las Vegas,"" she said. ""Last night was a good night, and today is just as good--getting the endorsement from this union."" If Clinton can win Nevada, by marrying support of the ascendant elements of the Democratic coalition with labor, she'll have proven her bona fides with critical wings of the party. And that sounds like the sort of test that a first Democratic voting state should provide."	Why Nevada May Be Hillary's New Favorite State
26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/hillary_clinton_s_debate_performance_should_end_the_joe_biden_talk.html	"Since the summer, Democrats have asked one question about their presidential primary: Will Joe Biden run? Some of this was a simple longing for a wider race beyond Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Some of it was interest in Biden, the person. How would this vice president, with his honesty and vulnerability, fare in a contest with Clinton? Would he upend the contest with authenticity? But much of it--the part that brought donors and operatives to the table--was worry. Democrats were worried about Clinton. Worried that Sanders would kill her campaign, worried that the email scandal might do so first, and worried that--at some point--Clinton would fall under the weight of her baggage. Biden was a safety valve for the Democratic Party, a hedge so that if Clinton left the race, a competent and mainstream Democrat would take her place. As of the first Democratic presidential debate--held Tuesday in Las Vegas--Biden wasn't in the race. But then, the evening's events showed that Democrats don't need him. If there's anything to take from the 21/2-hour match between Clinton, Sanders, Martin O'Malley, Jim Webb, and Lincoln Chafee, it's that Clinton is the front-runner for a reason, and there's no room for Biden. Sanders was passionate, and O'Malley was an able voice for left-of-center (but not ""socialist"") Democrats. But neither touched Clinton, who outclassed them with policy mastery and impressive political deftness. In the first hour, Clinton parried CNN debate moderator Anderson Cooper on her alleged opportunism--""I'm a progressive. But I'm a progressive who likes to get things done""--and turned Obama's decision to enlist her service at the State Department into an immunity pendant on the Iraq war (""[President Obama] valued my judgment""). She dominated the stage on foreign policy and national security, areas where Sanders could express broad themes but wasn't prepared to talk specifics. And on issues where Sanders is actually comfortable--social policy and Wall Street regulation--Clinton held her own, going into the weeds to press her case for shrinking banks and reducing college tuition. That's not to say Sanders was irrelevant--he was a major presence on the stage--but he wasn't prepared to challenge an experienced candidate like Clinton, who spent months debating against Barack Obama, John Edwards, Biden, and other challengers in the 2008 primary. Which gets to a key point. As a candidate in the invisible primary of jockeying and influence-building, Clinton muscled more credible competitors out of the race early. Sanders is a strong candidate. But he isn't Obama, or Sen. Elizabeth Warren, or Biden, or even former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick. If Clinton was relaxed and confident, it's because--as a strong, smart debater against a field of national newcomers--she could afford a looser attitude. At the same time, Clinton didn't avoid conflict. Exploiting Sanders' votes as a senator from rural Vermont, she attacked him on gun control, taking a hard line against the National Rifle Association and making Sanders look like the opportunist in the argument. Likewise, she handled O'Malley's Iraq criticism with a quick note that the former Maryland governor endorsed her in the 2008 primary. With that said, these moments of true sparring were few and far between. Throughout, Cooper gave the most credible candidates a chance to attack each other. And on almost every score, they declined, moving the debate toward substance and in one case, media criticism. O'Malley stood largely as a bona fide Clinton defender, landing his occasional attacks on Sanders or the other candidates and largely staying in his own lane, away from Clinton. If O'Malley's goal is a vice presidential spot or Cabinet position, he's playing the game well. As for the media criticism, Sanders earned the largest applause of the night when he denounced CNN for questions on Clinton's email controversy. ""Let me say something that may not be great politics, but I think the secretary is right,"" he said. ""The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails."" This is important; other than Chafee, who emphasized his ""scandal-free"" career, the Democratic field was united in dismissing email questions and the House Select Committee on Benghazi. To repeat myself from Monday, Republicans haven't found wrongdoing with their Benghazi and email investigations, but through error and incompetence they've given Clinton a path to dismiss and ignore questions on either issue. Clinton wasn't perfect. A more skilled and knowledgeable debater could have challenged (even flustered) her on the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Libya, areas where she was allowed to obfuscate previous positions and important details to avoid scrutiny. In a hypothetical debate against Marco Rubio, for instance, she could have trouble. But broadly, Clinton excelled in the forum. Democrats shouldn't worry. And if Democrats aren't worried, there's no reason for Biden to run. Two last points. First, it's hard not to contrast this debate with its Republican counterpart. The GOP debates were dominated by trivia and Trump. Candidates like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie wrapped themselves in gauzy generalities--""What folks want in this country is somebody to go down there and get the job done""--while credible contenders like Jeb Bush held embarrassing standoffs with the real estate mogul on national television (""To subject my wife into the middle of a raucous political conversation was completely inappropriate, and I hope you apologize for that, Donald""). The Democratic debate had its share of silliness, but overwhelmingly, the candidates focused on concrete differences and detailed policies, sparring over the particulars of gun legislation, tackling questions on race relations and police reform, and discussing national security without the saber-rattling of the GOP's conversation (""Weakness is provocative, and this Iranian nuclear deal is nothing short of catastrophic,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz in the most recent GOP debate). And although Republican candidates have to fight to flank one another on the right, lest they're knocked out by radicals like Cruz and Ben Carson, Democrats--even Sanders--swim mostly near the mainstream. On immigration, the minimum wage, Social Security, marriage equality, and the environment, Democrats are closer to middle American opinion than Republicans. Put differently, it's significant that two of the debaters onstage--Chafee and Webb--were former Republicans. And it's significant that the most popular Republican candidates, thus far, are a brash showman and an extremist. As researchers Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein demonstrate in their book, or as historian Geoffrey Kabaservice showed in his, or as we've seen with the collapse of House leadership and the rise of the fringe Freedom Caucus, the present-day GOP is an unprecedented political party, opposed to basic norms of compromise and governance. Which leads to my final thought. In the best-case scenario, if Democrats win next year, they'll have the White House and a small Senate majority. This makes passing legislation almost impossible. A Republican Congress--or even just a Republican House--will not pass universal prekindergarten or a comprehensive plan to subsidize college education. This raises a key question for Clinton, Sanders, and any other Democrat who wants to be president: How will you work your agenda through a gridlocked Washington? Democrats need an answer, because without one, their impressive plans are almost worthless. See all of Slate's coverage of the Democratic primary debate."	Hillary Clinton's Dominating Debate Performance Makes a Biden Run Unnecessary
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/clinton_won_the_democratic_debate_by_going_on_offense.html	"LAS VEGAS--Hillary Clinton came into the first Democratic presidential debate as the front-runner, and for perhaps the first time in the campaign, she looked like one. She was commanding on the issues and attacked Republicans in a way that was pleasing to Democrats and deflected the attacks aimed at her. If Joe Biden needed Clinton to falter to create a further appetite for his campaign, her performance seemed to have the opposite effect. Going into the debate the question was who might go after Clinton. Instead she was first to go on offense, lecturing Bernie Sanders on gun control, saying that he should have known that he was giving immunity to gun manufacturers with his 2005 Senate vote on the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. ""It wasn't that complicated to me. It was pretty straightforward to me,"" she said about her own vote, which was on the other side of the issue from Sanders. It was supposed to be Clinton who was on the defensive for her Senate vote--namely her support of the Iraq war--yet she took an early opportunity to roll up the congressional record and bonk Sanders over the head with it. The gun conversation came early, which meant that for a period of the debate--until Jim Webb came out against the Iran nuclear deal--Sanders was the candidate who had been defined the furthest on the right on an issue. Sanders, who is usually the one who shoots for the stars while leaving pragmatic realities to other contenders, on the gun issue made the case that the realities of representative government meant pro-gun areas were always going to make gun control difficult. Clinton, who told me on Face the Nation that she had no interest in going negative on Sanders, had clearly done her opposition research on him. ""Sen. Sanders,"" she said, ""you voted against the Brady bill that mandated background checks and a waiting period. You also supported allowing riders to bring guns in checked bags on Amtrak trains. For a decade, you said that holding gun manufacturers legally responsible for mass shootings is a bad idea. Now, you say you're reconsidering that. Which is it: Shield the gun companies from lawsuits or not?"" Shortly thereafter, when Sanders spent a few minutes discussing democratic socialism and answering why he doesn't consider himself a capitalist, Clinton drew another distinction between herself and the Vermont senator, interjecting with a defense of capitalism. ""I want to save capitalism from itself,"" she said. ""It's our job to rein in the excesses of capitalism so that it doesn't run amok and doesn't cause the kind of inequities we're seeing in our economic system. But we would be making a grave mistake to turn our backs on what built the greatest middle class in the history."" These answers set the tone for a night when Clinton consistently had forward-leaning answers. She was only on her heels briefly as she defended her vote in support of the Iraq war, giving Sanders a chance to describe the invasion as ""the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of the country."" Even in that moment she had a good retort, using Obama's hiring her after he'd criticizing her vote as proof that she had good judgment. But for Clinton the perfect answer came near the end of the debate, when she was asked about paid family leave:"	Clinton Won the Debate by Being Aggressive and Assured--and Having Fun

While people may disagree over who ""won"" Tuesday night's debate, we should have enough information to determine that Chafee, the former Rhode Island senator and governor, lost. Why did Chafee vote for the 1999 repeal of Glass-Steagall, the 1933 law that established a firewall between commercial and investment banking? Chafee explained several months ago that he voted for it because it was right after he was appointed to the Senate, and he didn't have any idea what he was doing. Inexplicably, he did not come up with a better answer before Tuesday night. At a debate. That was nationally televised. Yeesh! Anderson Cooper: Sen. Chafee, you voted for the very bill in 1999 that made [the big banks] bigger. Chafee: I had just arrived in the Senate-- Cooper: Are you saying you didn't know what you were voting for? Chafee: It was my very first vote, and it was 92-5-- Cooper: With all due respect, what does that say about you that you're casting a vote that you didn't know what you were voting for? Chafee: I think you're being rough. I had just arrived, my dad had just died, I just arrived ... and it was 92-5. Let me talk about income inequality. At least ""oops"" was brief.

29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/twitter_and_trump_commentary_about_cnn_s_democratic_primary_debate.html	Five Democratic presidential hopefuls will go toe to toe in the party's first debate of the primary season on Tuesday night. Yes, five; beside Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders there are apparently at least three other Democrats running for president: Former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb. The debate, which airs at 8:30 p.m. on CNN, will be the first of only six Democratic debates, so you better pay close attention. But that doesn't mean you can't have fun while doing it. Although the notion of a Trump-less debate may seem strange and tedious to us now, Republican front-runner Donald Trump--due to popular demand--has promised to fill any potential entertainment void and live-tweet the whole thing. And he's not the only off-screen personality worth watching. Below are live tweets from top pundits and politicos. On the left-hand side of the screen you'll see the liberal tweets. On the right-hand side you'll get the conservative ones. Watch the spinning ensue in real time! Read more of Slate's coverage of the Democratic primary.
