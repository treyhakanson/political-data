This time it's because he wisecracked at a Rotary Club luncheon about his fellow House Republicans' failure to take action on immigration reform. ""Here's the attitude: 'Oooooooh, don't make me do this! Ooooh, this is too hard!' "" Boehner said to the assembled Rotarians. And with that, Boehner sent the message that like virtually all elite Republicans, from Wall Street donors to policy wonks, he believes that comprehensive immigration reform is a no-brainer and that the conservatives who've been fighting against it are either cowards who don't have the guts to stand up to their constituents or troglodytes too thick-headed to understand that when Mark Zuckerberg, Mike Bloomberg, and the Wall Street Journal editorial page all agree on something, they can't be wrong. If nothing else, being an immigration reform cheerleader is a clear way for conservatives like Boehner to signal that they're not unenlightened bigots, like those right-wingers from the sticks they so disdain. Supporting immigration reform is also cheap from a budgeting perspective, since welcoming large numbers of less-skilled workers appears to cost taxpayers very little if you deny them access to subsidized health insurance, food stamps, and other anti-poverty programs, an approach favored by virtually all pro-immigration conservatives. But there's a small problem with this line of thinking. The comprehensive immigration reform proposals that have won bipartisan support, like the Senate immigration bill backed by the ""Gang of Eight,"" are heavily tilted toward the short-term interests of big business while not being tilted enough toward the interests of law-abiding immigrants hoping to enter the middle class. What we need is an immigration policy that will help rather than hinder our efforts to integrate the millions of struggling immigrants who already live and work in this country into the American mainstream and keep them from becoming a permanent underclass. The idea behind comprehensive immigration reform is that we ought to combine three separate things. The first and most politically contentious part is granting legal status of some kind to some share of the 11 million to 12 million unauthorized immigrants currently living in the United States. The second and least politically contentious part is welcoming a larger number of skilled professionals, entrepreneurs, scientists, and the like. The third and most underappreciated part is welcoming large numbers of less-skilled workers, whether through a guest-worker program or some other mechanism. Politically speaking, wrapping these three very different things in the same neat package makes a lot of sense. Comprehensive immigration reform unites high-tech companies looking for cheap software developers; agribusiness companies looking for cheap agricultural laborers; and ordinary voters, many of whom are immigrants themselves, who recoil at the idea of mass deportations that could, among other things, break up families and communities. Think of it as mutual hostage-taking. No, GoogleAppleFacebook, you can't hire more brainiacs from Belgium unless we grant legal status to the unauthorized. No, DREAMers who want to stay in America, you don't have the political muscle to get legal status without also getting the lettuce lobby on board. The other question, however, is whether this neat little package makes any logical sense. And the answer is that no, it does not. To understand the perversity of the American immigration debate, it helps to zoom out and consider how immigration policies work around the world. Crudely speaking, you can separate countries that attract and (to at least some degree) actually welcome immigrants into two camps: those that take the high road and those that take the low road. Recently, Martin Ruhs of Oxford University compiled a handy index of migrant rights. And he found that countries that grant migrants the most expansive rights, such as Sweden and Norway, where migrants can access social welfare benefits of all kinds and are given a lot of freedom, tend to accept very few economic migrants. Those that grant them the fewest rights, such as the Gulf states, welcome enormous numbers of them. When I say enormous, I mean enormous. In Qatar, for example, 94 percent of the labor force was born abroad, as was 86 percent of the 2 million people who live there in total. If you're a migrant worker in the Gulf, you're not going to be treated nearly as well as you would be in Stockholm, but the Gulf states are far more likely to let you in and to let you work. To show my cards a bit, I'll call the Scandinavian strategy ""high road"" and the Gulf strategy ""low road."" Some immigration advocates, like Lant Pritchett of the Harvard Kennedy School and the Center for Global Development, argue that the Gulf states are actually closer to getting immigration policy right than the Scandinavians. If we think of immigration policy as involving a quality-versus-quantity trade-off, Pritchett, who sees immigration from poor countries to rich countries as an important strategy for fighting global poverty, chooses quantity. If more Bengalis, Beninese, and Bhutanese are allowed to work in rich countries, they'll be able to send more in remittances to their families back home, which in turn will help lift more families out of poverty. This is true even if these migrant workers aren't granted many freedoms, if they're paid far less than local workers, and if they're only allowed in the country for a limited period of time. Indeed, from a poverty-fighting perspective, you'd actually want migrant workers to turn over pretty often: Each time one batch goes home, another batch could come to Doha or Dubai to earn money and send it back to their native countries. This churn is a great way to spread the wealth. So what's not to like about the low-road strategy? Well, a lot depends on the kind of society you want to have. The Gulf states have no intention of integrating poor migrant workers into their societies. They want them to come, work for a while, go home, and leave it at that. The Scandinavians, in contrast, spend a heck of a lot of money to see to it that migrants can be full participants in society. They don't always do a great job, but they certainly try. And they try because they reject the idea of a two-tiered society, in which privileged natives live cheek-by-jowl with migrants who have no hope of living alongside them as equals. Perhaps the Scandinavians are just naive. If these migrants weren't living alongside them, they'd still be living somewhere, and they'd almost certainly be a lot worse off. Other views, however, are that migration can never be as good a solution for fighting global poverty as improving governance in poor countries and that all countries, including rich countries, have the right to pursue their vision of the good society--including one in which you accept a small number of migrants and treat them extremely well. Should the United States take the high road or the low road? Right now, we're doing a weird mix of both. For example, as Neeraj Kaushal, an economist at Columbia University, has observed, the incidence of food insecurity in the United States is unusually high for a rich country, and this is largely because of food insecurity among immigrant families who aren't eligible for food stamps. The idea behind denying immigrant families food stamps is straightforward. Immigrants chose to come here, so it's up to them to feed themselves. It's an idea that resonates with pro-immigration conservatives and libertarians, who celebrate immigrants for their pluck and determination. If anything, denying immigrants access to social programs was their way of convincing their conservative allies that immigrants are not in fact freeloaders and that we should welcome more of them. When it comes to quality versus quantity, the pro-immigration right wants us to be a bit more like Qatar and a bit less like Norway. Yet the trouble is that immigrant families have children, and those children will, chances are, grow up to become American workers. And recent work by the economists Hilary Hoynes, Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach, and Douglas Almond suggests that when poor children have access to food stamps, they grow up to be healthier, more economically self-sufficient adults. Countries like Qatar solve this problem by making it difficult if not impossible for migrants to form families and by booting them out of the country if they become a burden. We Americans are not quite hard-nosed enough to really see the low-road strategy through. So we wind up living with the consequences of our stinginess when the children of poor immigrants struggle to climb the economic ladder as adults. So here is my immigration proposal for Speaker Boehner or for anyone who wants it. Let's face the fact that we're going to grant legal status to most of the unauthorized immigrants who currently live in this country. Then let's face the fact that granting legal status to this population means taking moral responsibility for its members as members of the broader American community. The unauthorized immigrant population is extremely, extremely poor. In 2011, 51 percent of unauthorized immigrant children lived in households below the poverty line, and 78 percent lived in households below 200 percent of the poverty line. Even under a best-case scenario, granting members of the unauthorized immigrant population legal status won't vault them into the middle class. Actually integrating these women and men and their children into the American mainstream will be an expensive, arduous process that will take decades. We need to be sure that future immigration does not reduce the wages of these workers by subjecting them to competition from workers with very similar skills. Instead, we should welcome skilled immigrants who will bid up the wages of less-skilled workers and a small number of less-skilled immigrants we intend to treat humanely and with respect, fully recognizing that their children will be as American as our own. In short, let's take the high road."	Should U.S. Immigration Policy Be More Like Qatar's or Sweden's?

The bill, which sailed through the state's lower chamber this past Monday, represents the latest victory for a onetime fringe movement that has spent the past two decades slowly gaining traction among conservatives by warning of an actual, real-life U.N.-orchestrated global takeover. The specific target of the Missouri legislation may be well-known to heavy consumers of conservative media, but most Americans have probably never heard of it: Agenda 21, a nonbinding resolution that was signed by President George H.W. Bush and 177 other world leaders at the end of the United Nations' 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. The effort was hailed at the time as an important, albeit voluntary, action plan to promote sustainable development in the face of a rapidly expanding global population, but ultimately failed to become much more than a feel-good Democratic talking point back in the United States. In 2012 a full 85 percent of Americans didn't know enough about the U.N. resolution to have an opinion on it, according to a poll commissioned by the American Planning Association that summer. Not everyone forgot about it, however. Agenda 21 remained front and center for a subset of right-wing conservatives who warned that it was a harbinger of a looming new world order that would culminate with the seizure of land and guns, and an end to the American way of life. If that last part sounds like the plot of a dystopian novel written by Glenn Beck, well, that's because it is. But what began as a far-fetched conspiracy theory has since transformed into an effective, almost methodical movement to block the type of ""livability"" initiatives that President Obama and his allies have made a priority. If you look past the black helicopters in the anti-Agenda 21 origin story, you'll find a series of smart-growth-blocking victories at the state and local levels in nearly every corner of the country. The movement, fueled largely by groups like the John Birch Society and the American Policy Center, has found mounting success by targeting sustainable development efforts on multiple levels, from the individual projects themselves to the state policies that make them possible. Local activists waving the AgEnder (their word) flag have derailed a congestion-easing highway project in Maine, a regional transportation plan in Greater Atlanta, and a high-speed train project in Florida, while causing similar trouble for a variety of other sprawl-curbing, energy-conserving projects around the country. The effort's crowning achievements to date arguably both occurred in Alabama, where the Republican governor became the first to sign binding anti-Agenda 21 legislation into law in 2012, and where an entire nine-person planning commission in Baldwin County quit that same year in protest over the decision to scrap their award-winning regional development plan after it was tarred by its opponents. (For a more complete account of the Baldwin fight, check out the final chapter in this April report from the Southern Poverty Law Center, which also identifies some of the loudest voices in the national movement.) Where there are no sustainable-development projects to target specifically, anti-21 activists have taken aim at the process behind such projects, working to dismantle the planning infrastructure that is needed to develop plans for smart meters, new bike lanes, or any other effort that makes curbing greenhouse gas emissions a priority. Under pressure from AgEnders, more than a dozen cities, towns, and counties have ended their relationship with ICLEI USA, a Northern California-based nonprofit that consults on sustainability issues by offering software and advice to member communities looking to go green. As the New York Times reported in 2012, the debate at a council meeting in Missoula, Mont., about the city's four-figure contract with the nonprofit grew so heated that the police had to be called in to keep the peace. Over the past three years, conservatives have introduced anti-Agenda 21 bills or nonbinding resolutions in a total of 26 states, passing such efforts in five of them, according to data compiled by Karen Trapenberg Frick, a policy professor at the University of California-Berkeley who has tracked the effort.* One of the remarkable things about the campaign is that the anti-Agenda 21 activists often win simply by showing up. Frick's research suggests that state bills--even when they fail--ultimately ""inspire imitation and create momentum"" for the movement, resulting in more converts around the country. Frick says she's also noticed a relatively recent change in how activists are delivering their pitch at planning meetings: ""Some activists--certainly not all, but some--are starting to shape-shift a bit to speak the language of city planners,"" she told me. Policy experts likewise see a potential ""chilling effect"" on future sustainability activities anywhere anti-Agenda 21 nonbinding resolutions are passed. Planners, meanwhile, will be more directly handcuffed in those states where the anti-21 efforts become law. As Dennis Murphey, the chief environmental officer for the city of Kansas City, Mo., warned last month, the Missouri bill could prevent his city from teaming with any organization that has goals in common with the U.N. resolution, which in addition to promoting sustainable development also seeks to curb global poverty and get more women involved in government. Under that strict legislative reading, the city could be forced to cut ties with everyone from the Kiwanis Club to the Girl Scouts. While not the first to raise the anti-Agenda 21 flag, Glenn Beck has probably drawn the most attention to it. He repeatedly used his perch on Fox News early in the decade to warn of an impending one-world order. His magazine, the Blaze, put Agenda 21 on the cover of its January/February 2012 issue, calling the resolution a ""global scheme that has the potential to wipe out freedoms of all U.S. citizens."" That fall he released the aforementioned science fiction novel titled Agenda 21, which tells the tale of a country ""once known as America"" where citizens are ""confined to ubiquitous concrete living spaces"" and food, water, and energy are strictly rationed. Those fears were quickly echoed by Beck's fellow conservative rabble-rousers. Fox News' Eric Bolling, for one, warned on air that the U.N. effort would one day lead to a world where ""a centralized planning agency would be responsible for oversight into all areas of our lives."" The hyperbolic nature of that rhetoric quickly seeped into state legislatures around the country. Two years ago Georgia Senate Majority Leader Chip Rogers used a closed-door briefing--video of which was later obtained by Mother Jones--to warn his Republican colleagues that Obama and his allies were relying on a ""mind-control technique"" to ensure that the plan for a totalitarian environmental government would proceed as planned. State Rep. Mike Moon, the lead sponsor of the bill now winding its way through the Missouri legislature, picked up the baton earlier this year, assuring his fellow lawmakers at a hearing that one of Agenda 21's goals was to ""elevate nature above man."" With the exception of occasional mentions by national figures like Ted Cruz and Newt Gingrich, the U.N. conspiracy theory has largely proved a few notches too extreme to find a foothold inside the Beltway, although it did earn a mostly overlooked mention in the 2012 Republican National Committee platform, which decried Agenda 21 as ""erosive of American sovereignty."" But given the remarkable success the effort continues to find at the state and local levels, it's evident that the AgEnder movement doesn't necessarily need to find a seat at the table in Washington. Its current strategy would appear to be going perfectly to plan. *Correction, May 5, 2014: This piece originally misspelled the University of California-Berekely. (Return.)"	Conservatives Have Turned a New World Order Conspiracy Theory Into a Plan to Kill Mass Transit
2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/taylor_griffin_tries_to_unseat_walter_jones_what_does_north_carolina_s_gop.html	"NEW BERN, N.C.--""I've got to show you the 300th-anniversary tourism video,"" says Taylor Griffin. ""It's a requirement--you have to see it as soon as you get into town."" Griffin, who is 38 and stands a decent chance of becoming a congressman this year, guides me inside the sturdy old house he's using as a campaign office. He hits ""play,"" and I am introduced to ""North Carolina's Colonial Capital,"" a scenic town that looks even more so when a cameraman shoots it from a swooping helicopter on a sunny day. Children buy Pepsi at the store where it was invented. Novelist Nicholas Sparks explains how New Bern inspires his tales of love and beach walks and Alzheimer's. Three minutes later I understand why Griffin moved to New Bern last year to run for Congress. He was born in eastern North Carolina, inside the old 3rd District (just outside the boundaries as redrawn in 2011), but he left in the 1990s to build a career in Washington--the late Sen. Jesse Helms' office, the Bush administration, K Street. After enough people asked him, ""What's up with Rep. Walter Jones?"" he returned to the 3rd, where places like this were working their small-town osmosis on him. ""I'm a creature of eastern North Carolina,"" Griffin says. ""I always have been. I just worked in D.C. I lived in D.C., saw the lifestyle there, and just don't have the interest there that I have in my home."" This is part manifesto, part rebuttal. Jones, who's 71 and has represented most of North Carolina's coast in Congress since 1995, is vulnerable because he's stopped voting with Republicans. It started a decade ago. Jones, who'd lobbied the House to rename french fries as ""freedom fries"" in the run-up to the Iraq war, turned hard against the military campaign. He voted against war funding whenever it got to the floor, and with damp eyes he chastised Bush administration officials who, he believed, let soldiers die for a lie. In 2008 a Republican county commissioner challenged Jones for re-election on the grounds that the congressman who represented Camp Lejune should at least stop bashing the war effort. Jones won the primary by 20 points and won subsequent primaries by even more. It helped that George W. Bush left the White House and the Ron Paul wing of the GOP was winning adherents. Jones kept voting against his party and reaching out to anti-war conservatives. ""Lyndon Johnson's probably rotting in hell right now because of the Vietnam War,"" Jones told a 2013 gathering of the Young Americans for Liberty, a Paul-founded group. ""He probably needs to move over for Dick Cheney."" The Republican foreign policy establishment could not stand this guy, but nor could it get rid of him. Griffin, party poobahs believe, can fix that, aided by that 2011 map that removed some of Jones' base. In the last month, ads from the conservative Ending Spending and the self-explanatory Emergency Committee for Israel have hit the district (where TV is cheap) with commercials insisting that Jones has become an Obama-ite. The ECI ad warns that Jones ""preaches American decline"" and ""opposes sanctions on Iran."" Both ads accuse him of being the ""most liberal"" member of Congress because his votes against Republican bills like the Paul Ryan budgets ran up his score. Former Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer and former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour both donated to Griffin. The Paul faction, which keeps getting told it's taking over the party, dreads losing a race like this. Jones' response: total culture war, and total derision of his opponent, a ""Washington insider"" who partied with the enemy and showed up far too often in Politico's Playbook. Why, Jones is from here; his father, Walter B. Jones Sr., represented this part of the state for 26 years, and more than one early voter tells me that they have seen no reason to reject the new ""old Walter."" Jones' ads define what it means to be an outsider, one who ""wouldn't vote for the Wall Street bailouts or to increase the debt ceiling."" You can trust him, because all the wrong people don't. ""Walter won't show up 20 miles of where I'm going to be,"" says Griffin on Tuesday, after we meet at one of the two local Tea Party events he's going to hit that night. ""He will make sure that copies of my lobbying registration are on the table when you walk into county conventions."" (The registration, for work Griffin did with a Dubai-based company, is helpfully labeled ""DOWN EAST vs. Middle East,"" with the latter phrase written out in Arabesque script. Jones' campaign didn't answer any questions I sent, and I detected a knowing laugh when I asked for time with the congressman after saying I was a Washington reporter.) It's already after 6 p.m. when the two of us reach the Tea Party event. The crowd is coming in slowly, perusing some Americans for Prosperity brochures that the local organizers has placed on some cafe tables. Griffin works voters, hands out signs--""have some campaign propaganda!""--and gives them his number as a supporter named Verne Thompson sets up a camera to tape that night's speaker. He's already voted early, for Griffin and for social conservative Senate candidate Mark Harris. ""I actually have a libertarian streak,"" says Thompson. ""There are many issues on which I have the libertarian view. They are just nuts on foreign policy. All you've got to do is look at the pronouncements of Ron Paul. It's just not a credible position. Walter votes against aid to Israel, but the United States has no better, more consistent ally in the Middle East than Israel. We give money to the Palestinians, for Chrissake! So I certainly don't agree with any of Jones' reservations about Israel."" Griffin's campaign manager, a veteran of that 2008 primary against Jones, calls to tell the candidate that he ""should have left five minutes ago."" He's destined to be late to a meeting of the Crystal Coast Tea Party in Emerald Isle, an hour away if you're lucky. So Griffin hands his number to the Tea Partiers he'd been talking to and walks to a Chevy truck with a ""W '04"" sticker on the back and 216,937 miles on the speedometer. ""I'm running this thing into the ground,"" he says. ""The mileage is terrible."" We head off, and Griffin talks on and off the record in between phone calls and stories about how he used to drive to the shore. He'd just been endorsed by Sarah Palin; some of the calls, from supporters, are about how best to leverage this burst of free media. ""Right after Palin was chosen for the ticket, Steve Schmidt called me up and said, 'You're heading to Alaska,' "" recalls Griffin. ""Someone packed my bag and I flew right there."" It was his job to beat ""a hundred investigative reporters"" to the Palin dirt and give daily spin. I eventually get around to asking Griffin how much he agrees with Palin. Over the weekend, she'd joked that waterboarding was a way to ""baptize terrorists."" That definitely wasn't the sort of thing Walter Jones would say. What did he think of the quote? ""Well, Sarah Palin's a lot more quotable than me,"" says Griffin. He pauses for a few seconds. ""The struggle between civil liberties and national security did not start yesterday and it won't end tomorrow. Pre-9/11 we went too far in the wrong direction. Now, we need to ask whether we're swinging the pendulum too far back in the direction before 9/11 that allowed an attack on our nation. But we cannot forget that there are still people in the world who want to destroy Americans and our country and our way of life."" This is not how Griffin usually talks. When we get to the Crystal Coast Tea Party meeting, at the back of a seafood restaurant, 15 activists are talking about a mounting threat to the state's voter ID laws and linking it back to Attorney General Eric Holder. Griffin interrupts them with good cheer. ""There is no harder-working Tea Party group or grassroots group in the district,"" he says. ""People respect you all over North Carolina. They know you all do your homework. You're talking about the tall-structural ordinance and you're talking about the school budget. You all understand that government starts at the local level and that citizens have to be on the watch."" They also deal in congressional politics, and they happened to endorse Griffin by a landslide, after an already legendary interview (""we pelted him with questions,"" says one activist) that started at 6 p.m., continued until the restaurant locked its doors, and ended at another bar's closing time. Griffin's rewards included a place on the CCTP's voter palm card and the loyalty of activists who show up at the polls, write blog posts, and call in to radio shows. ""I've been working the polls and it's going at least 4- or 5-to-1 in your favor in the early vote,"" one activist tells Griffin. ""Today, you throw Sarah's endorsement in there and that's taken some people from 'hm, maybe' to 'yeah, OK!' "" After the meeting breaks up, as Griffin talks to the organizers (""I usually get a beer with those guys afterward""), I talk to Jim and Pat Nalitz. They moved to the district permanently in 2007, after years of making annual escapes from the Virginia suburbs, and have long pined for a way to oust Jones. ""People here have come to the conclusion that he's no longer conservative,"" says Jim. ""He's been corrupted by the bubble,"" says Pat. ""It's what happens when you get up there."" ""He's not even a good Republican when it comes to being a conservative,"" says Jim. ""The other House Republicans don't even like him."" He stops himself. ""Well, that might not be a bad thing."" ""I did support him when he got kicked off the committee,"" says Pat. It's not easy to hold this kind of Tea Party support, or this kind of Republican. Jones, according to Griffin, is so ineffective that the district won't be able to get what it needs from the government. Those people employed by the military bases--well, they need to stay employed. But voters want a Republican who'll say no to most things. On the drive back to New Bern, Griffin tells me he would have joined the Republicans who refused to fund Obamacare ""if the defund strategy made sense."" Later, back in his old-new hometown, he reminds me how he started in politics. ""I worked with Jesse Helms, and I think international institutions are largely useless,"" he says. ""It's absolutely time to re-evaluate our U.N. dues."" Griffin buys coffee and baked goods from one of the merchants he now knows by name, and talks through all the ""lazy"" ways to talk about his race. He's already read the story about how ""insiders"" like him are taking over politics. Lazy. He's read the ""Paul vs. neocons"" story. ""I don't think Walter Jones fits neatly into the Paul box,"" he says. ""In the Venn diagram, there's some cursory overlap, but that's not who Walter Jones is. The point is that this election is about eastern North Carolina."" Anyway, neocon? ""When a label becomes a pejorative, it no longer has any use in describing people."" We talk a little bit about the National Security Agency, and Griffin takes some pleasure in walking me through the SWIFT program, the terror money-tracking initiative he worked on in the Bush administration's Treasury Department. Griffin repeats what the administration said when the New York Times broke the news of the program's existence: There might be blood on Bill Keller's hands. It strikes me that Griffin and Jones have completely divergent views of what the Bush/Cheney legacy's going to be. ""I observed George W. Bush as a person who got up every morning thinking about what was right for the country,"" says Griffin. ""You've got to remember, this was a time when we felt the threat of a terrorist attack was very real. It affected all of us. We felt an incredible obligation to protect the country from the next terrorist attack. You have to view every decision made in that context. And in that context, I think history will see him very well. History isn't written yet. The drafts of history written contemporarily are always much less favorable than the drafts of history that are made with the benefit of perspective and hindsight."""

3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/benghazi_white_house_emails_did_the_obama_administration_engage_in_a_cover.html	"Has the Benghazi ""smoking gun"" been found? Some White House critics believe that new documents wrestled from the White House by Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group, prove that the Obama administration concocted a cover-up: Political advisers pushed a false story that the murder of four Americans grew out of a protest against an anti-Islamic video in order to hide a policy failure that might hurt the president in an election year. The documents clearly show that the White House pushed the video story, but there's also proof that the White House believed the story they were pushing. Were White House officials desperate enough to make up a story? Or were they just embracing and pushing the most politically beneficial version? That is the heart of the matter, but it also raises a larger question about what we call a lie when we look at administration spin: What is willful deceit, what is willful blindness, and what is merely the tunnel vision that comes from constant partisan warfare? The Obama administration's story has never been straight on the Benghazi attack. Press Secretary Jay Carney once said the White House and State Department had only been involved in changing one word in crafting the first public response about the attack--the infamous Susan Rice talking points. Emails released in May showed that wasn't the case. This new batch underscores the White House's involvement in shaping the story. The Obama administration left the impression that everything related to the Benghazi attack had been released to the investigating committees months ago. That is also clearly false. There have been other instances where the White House line on Benghazi has also earned it Pinocchios. On the theory that repeated false statements should initiate more questions, it's obvious questions should continue to be asked. Also tantalizing is an email exchange in the current batch related to a Fox News story: ""U.S. officials knew Libya attack was terrorism within 24 hours, sources confirm."" The article was circulated among dozens of officials, including then-deputy national security adviser and now chief of staff Denis McDonough, but the subsequent email discussions are all redacted. When the Republican National Committee claims that the White House put ""politics before transparency,"" they are right. Still, that doesn't prove that White House political hacks cooked up a story about a video. The ""smoking gun,"" according to Sen. Lindsey Graham and others, is an email from deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes. (Rhodes is the brother to CBS News President David Rhodes; I also work for CBS.) The email shows that the White House was engaged in a coordinated effort to cover the president's backside. That is not necessarily new. They do that every day. Anyone watching Susan Rice talk about Benghazi knew that the White House, with an election just months away, was desperate to frame this event as an extraordinary and unpredictable one, not a policy failure. The key line in the Rhodes email is that the emphasis of team spin should be to ""underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure of policy."" He's talking about protests, plural, because hell was breaking out all over the Middle East, and the leading theory was that an anti-Islamic video had helped stir it up. Aides were also directed to portray Obama as ""steady and statesmanlike."" Later Rhodes writes that the goal is ""[t]o reinforce the President and Administration's strength and steadiness in dealing with difficult challenges."" So, the top White House national security spokesman, communicating to the public about a national security emergency, made covering for the president's political fortunes his top priority. Bad. Spin and the instinct to protect at all costs rather than inform are pernicious instincts in this administration and those that came before it. Throughout the Benghazi story there has been a greasy effort to show both that the president is resolute, on the case, and a strong leader and that this wasn't an act of terrorism that could in any way be used to argue that his policies were to blame. On Wednesday, Carney said that the Rhodes email had not been released because ""this document was not about Benghazi."" I suppose it depends on what your definition of the word Benghazi is. The email is not about Benghazi specifically, that's true, but the email was about preparing Rice for the Sunday talk shows, which came the week after an attack in which four Americans were killed in Benghazi. That was the biggest issue on the table. Protests in Yemen were not close. The White House should not rely on super-literal word games. Although this explanation may be a defense against not releasing Rhodes' email, it dooms the administration when it comes to the question of who inserted the ""video"" into the Benghazi conversation. The word video doesn't show up in any of the emails from the CIA or State Department that were used to prepare Rice. Former CIA Director Michael Morell testified that he doesn't know where the discussion of the video came from. So if you want to be hyperliteral, it's obvious that Rice and the White House were the ones who emphasized the video, and that's the end of that. Condemnation all around. But how far off was Rice to talk about the video when compared with the information being put together at the time by the CIA, presumably the administration's best intelligence source? Rhodes sent his email at 8 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 14. Nine hours earlier, the CIA had sent its first set of talking points. The very first line of the first CIA talking point reads: ""The currently available information suggests that the attacks in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the US Embassy in Cairo and evolved into a direct assault against the US Consulate and subsequently its annex.""* (The original copies are here, released by the White House last May.) What was causing the protests in Cairo that the CIA mentions? The video. If you said the uproar over L.A. Clippers owner Donald Sterling was created by foul racism versus saying it was created by an audiotape, how significant would the distinction be? Here's what Rice actually said on Face the Nation: ""Based on the best information we have to date, what our assessment is as of the present is in fact what began spontaneously in Benghazi as a reaction to what had transpired some hours earlier in Cairo where, of course, as you know, there was a violent protest outside of our embassy--sparked by this hateful video."" It may now be laughable for anyone to suggest that the Libyan attack was spontaneous, but that's a question for the CIA, which made spontaneity its first and most durable claim that weekend. An intelligence failure is a different thing than a lie, and it should lead to a different set of questions about the underlying policy and skills of administration officials to accurately understand the world. You could also ask whether it's possible to make good policy when engaged in one-foot-in and one-foot-out operations like the U.S. attack on Libya. But those are policy questions, not cover-up questions. There was other intelligence during that period that suggested the attack on Benghazi was not spontaneous or linked to a video. Was that evidence solid enough that White House officials preparing Rice should have overruled the CIA assessment? Or was the evidence murky enough that it didn't disturb White House officials rushing to put the best face on things for their boss? Answers to those questions are not resolved by this new information. Over the course of Sept. 14, the Rice talking points were changed 12 times. Previous reporting shows the revisions didn't come from the White House, which had signed off on the first CIA version, but from the State Department, where staffers were trying to do damage control for other reasons--reasons that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will have to explain if she runs for president in 2016. Among the most incendiary claims removed was that the CIA had warned about attacks in Cairo before they happened. (The latest emails offer another account of what went on between the CIA and State Department.) Also removed in the State Department's rounds of editing were any references to potential al-Qaida responsibility for the attacks. Presumably this would have been a key target for whitewashing if Rhodes or other White House officials were consumed with altering the facts to protect the president. On the campaign trail, Obama had been boasting that al-Qaida was on the run. But neither Rhodes nor any other White House official appear to have raised it. Finally, there are countless references in the Judicial Watch documents to the video that have nothing to do with finding an explanation for the attack in Libya. The video is at the center of administration fears of a regionwide conflagration. There is a frantic effort to distance the U.S. government from the video and the violence that officials think is associated with it, and of course to show that the president is on the case. Rhodes writes: ""[W]e've made our views on this video crystal clear. The United States government had nothing to do with it. We reject its message and its contents. We find it disgusting and reprehensible. But there is absolutely no justification at all for responding to this movie with violence. And we are working to make sure that people around the globe hear that message."" This brings to mind the old story about a man who wants to take a nap, but he can't because kids are playing in the street. To disperse them, he concocts a completely fake story. He opens the window and tells them there are fresh, free oranges being given away down at the dock. The kids run off to get the delicious treats. The man settles back into his bed but finds he can't sleep. He can't stop thinking about how he's missing out on those free oranges. Could the White House have created the fiction about the video and then been consumed with managing the fallout from the video at the same time, like our man with the oranges? Perhaps, but there is also evidence in the documents for another explanation. The administration was practicing garden-variety self-deception: Administration officials, who came into office on a wave of skepticism about the quality of CIA intelligence, believed what their intelligence agency told them and what was in the president's best political interest to believe. Correction, May 2, 2014: This article originally stated that the first draft of the CIA talking points referred to ""demonstrations in Benghazi."" The first draft referred to ""attacks in Benghazi."" In the third draft, in revisions made by the CIA, it was changed to ""demonstrations,"" and it remained as such through the CIA's nine additional versions. (Return.)"

In the latest Washington Post poll, Democrats outscore Republicans on the economy, health care, the minimum wage, immigration, the ""middle class,"" climate change, abortion, and same-sex marriage. Indeed, when asked who they trust to better handle the nation's problems overall, 40 percent of respondents say Democrats, versus 34 percent who say Republicans. But elections aren't won on issues. That voters agree with Democrats doesn't mean they'll vote for Democratic candidates. No, when voters go to the polls, they look at two things: the president and the state of the economy. And on both scores, the Democratic Party has reason to worry. Just 41 percent of Americans approve of Obama's job performance, an all-time low for the president. Fifty-two percent disapprove. Sixty-six percent say the country is on the wrong track, and 54 percent disapprove of the way Obama is handling the economy. With those numbers, it's not a surprise that--when asked their preference--53 percent say they want a GOP-led Congress to act as a check on the president's policies. None of this is good news, but it's far from the worst that could happen. At various points in 2012, for instance, Obama's approval rating was similarly low and the public similarly discontented with his performance and the state of the country. The big difference, of course, is that Obama's weakness with the public was balanced by his strength among voters, who were younger, browner, and less affluent than in the previous presidential election. Pushed by this ""coalition of the ascendant,"" Obama rode to victory, and Democrats bolstered their majority in the Senate. Unfortunately for Democrats, two things are true this year: First, Obama isn't on the ballot, and second, those voters are among the least likely to vote in midterm elections. According to the Post, just 55 percent of nonwhites, 53 percent of young people, and 57 percent of people with incomes below $50,000 are ""absolutely certain to vote"" in November. By contrast, those numbers jump for whites (73 percent), older people (79 percent), and the more affluent (78 percent). In other words, the Americans most likely to vote Republican are also the ones most likely to go to the polls. A fact that, if I were a Democratic strategist, would fill me with panic. If this holds for the rest of the year--if Democrats can't boost their turnout to something close to 2012 levels--then Republicans might win another landslide, growing their House majority and capturing the Senate. Indeed, with a wave like that, they could make pickups in Colorado, Michigan, and New Hampshire, where Democrats have an edge that could erode in the face of a GOP-centered electorate. With that said, if Republicans pick up seats this fall, they should be careful not to overinterpret the gains. If they win a Senate majority, it will have less to do with broad public support for their aims as much as it will stem from the unusual composition of a midterm electorate, where Democratic voters tend to vote every four years and Republican ones every two. In which case, the GOP can't assume that their midterm message would help in a presidential year. Which is to say that, if I were a Republican strategist, I would advise my clients to ease up on the anti-Obamacare rhetoric. Yes, it's useful. For as much as the exchanges are populated and the Medicaid expansion is popular (so much so that GOP candidates aren't sure how to address it), it's still true that Republicans are stuck on the ""repeal and replace"" message, even as majorities reject ""repeal"" as an option. It's popular with the base, however, and in elections driven by turnout, that's a strong advantage. But Republicans shouldn't take that as an endorsement. As a whole, the public opposes repeal and doesn't support the GOP's scorched-earth approach to the law. If the GOP claims a mandate for their opposition, it risks a repeat of 2011, when it destroyed its standing with voters through a series of stunt votes and standoffs. This didn't doom its presidential chances the following year, but it was an unnecessary obstacle. Obviously, a lot can change between now and November, and this week's poll is no guarantee that Republicans will win a Senate majority. But the odds are in their favor, and if they succeed, they should proceed with caution. Republicans don't have the public on their side; they have their public, and that makes all the difference."	Why the GOP Shouldn't Interpret Its Strong Poll Numbers as Actual Support

But it has been maligned for all the wrong reasons. I am happy to report, though, that if the Tea Party learns from its mistakes, it can still be a powerful force for good. What does everyone get wrong about the Tea Party? When Democratic Rep. Charlie Rangel described it as a collection of ""mean, racist people,"" he was doing little more than bluntly restating views that are widely held on the left. When Tea Party conservatives counter such charges of racism by noting the popularity of African-Americans like Ben Carson, Allen West, Herman Cain, and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, they are routinely dismissed. One scholar, University of Washington political scientist Christopher Parker, went so far as to attribute the rise of conservative black candidates and activists to Tea Party prominence to the triumph of tokenism. Yet when you delve into Parker's data on the racial attitudes of white voters toward blacks, as Robert VerBruggen and Cathy Young did a few years back, you'll find that the views of whites who support the Tea Party and those who don't are not that far apart. It turns out that whites who have negative attitudes about minorities tend to also have negative attitudes about other whites. You'd be on much firmer ground calling the Tea Party cranky than you would be calling it racist. The Tea Party right is accused of more than just bigotry. In The Tea Party and the Making of Republican Conservatism, Harvard sociologist and political scientist Theda Skocpol and her co-author Vanessa Williamson observe that Tea Party conservatives will often distinguish between government transfers that flow to deserving productive citizens (like themselves) and those that benefit people they see as undeserving freeloaders (unlike themselves). Their work dovetails with the oft-heard notion that the Tea Party's anti-government rhetoric is hypocritical, and that any ""deservingness"" distinction its members make is both bogus and transparently self-serving. But this distinction was absolutely central to FDR's New Deal and Bill Clinton's commitment to help those who ""work hard and play by the rules."" Few serious people deny that means-tested programs can make it hard for poor families to climb the economic ladder, and there is nothing hypocritical about believing both that these programs should be made more work-friendly and that the safety net for older Americans should be protected. Finally, the Tea Party has been assailed as inauthentic, a faux grassroots, ""astroturf"" movement financed by shadowy elites who have essentially duped an army of cranky retirees into doing their bidding. You hear this not only from left-liberals like Chris Hayes, the MSNBC host and author of Twilight of the Elites, but occasionally from Republicans like Ann Coulter who are looking to defend GOP incumbents facing Tea Party challengers. The fact that wealthy campaign donors are far more likely to support establishment Republicans over Tea Party conservatives in GOP primaries tells a different story. Yes, the spending habits of some Tea Party organizations should be cause for embarrassment, a beat that Slate's David Weigel has on lock. But is this really a Tea Party-specific problem? I would argue that the presence of hucksters who use politics for personal gain is simply a long-standing tradition. So what is really wrong with the Tea Party, then? It's that it has so far failed to live up to its populist convictions. If the Tea Party were to fight crony capitalism as hard as it fights wasteful spending, and if its members were to train their anger on the Wall Street-Washington axis that deserves so much of the blame for our stagnant economy, it would be the most constructive and powerful political force of our time. There is still time for the Tea Party to change course. But if that's going to happen, we first have to understand where the movement first went wrong. The Tea Party emerged in opposition to President Obama's call for fiscal stimulus and for the creation of a new health entitlement program. Yet it also represented a backlash against entrenched, moneyed Republican elites. And Republican elites had it coming. They had grown unresponsive to the real needs of rank-and-file Republican voters throughout the 1990s and the 2000s. During George W. Bush's second term, his domestic policy efforts centered around an ill-timed effort to modernize Social Security--an idea that had almost no popular resonance--and an effort to create a guest-worker program that seemed tailor-made to serve the interests of big business. Though the Bush White House did tepidly advance a few health reform ideas, it didn't put them front and center, despite the fact that large numbers of low- and middle-income Americans were at risk of losing their insurance and millions of others were forced to get by without any health coverage at all. The Iraq quagmire reinforced the sense that the GOP establishment had lost its way. It's no wonder that grassroots conservatives were furious, and ready to revolt. When the financial crisis hit and Wise Men of both parties responded by backing bailouts that favored the wealthy and connected, the pot boiled over. Grassroots conservatives cast a wary eye at all new efforts to expand Washington's reach and influence, fearing that every new program from the technocratic Obama administration was another power grab designed to reward Washington insiders. Republicans who worked with the new president were deemed traitors to the cause. The entire system had to be torn down and rebuilt according to America's founding principles. I get the anti-bailout anger. I also get why conservatives who had grown sick and tired of Bush were even more skeptical of Barack Obama, who seemed to double down on the notion that Washington knows best. What was lost in the immediate aftermath of the crisis, however, was that not all bailouts are created equal. When Rick Santelli, the CNBC personality widely credited with giving the Tea Party movement its name, raged against an Obama administration initiative designed to help underwater borrowers way back in February 2009, he claimed that it would force responsible taxpayers to reward irresponsible borrowers who bought more house than they could afford. And plenty of conservatives bought into the idea. The problem with Santelli's line of thinking is that the vast majority of low- and middle-income borrowers with underwater mortgages were responsible, hardworking taxpayers who were caught in a maelstrom. Real estate brokers lied about the value of homes, as did real estate appraisers, who worked with mortgage lenders to load families up with debt. Mortgage lenders then sold their mortgages to other investors, and thus didn't bear the risks associated with their irresponsible lending. There was plenty of blame to go around. So why did Santelli insist that only borrowers should be left holding the bag? Why shouldn't at least some of the TARP money that had been devoted to rescuing America's financial system be used to ease the burden on borrowers? There was at least one Republican who understood what had gone wrong and what it would take to fix it, but it wasn't Michele Bachmann or Jim DeMint or some other Tea Party rabble-rouser. It was Glenn Hubbard, a paragon of the Republican establishment who had served as chairman of George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisors. As early as 2008, Hubbard realized that allowing low- and middle-income borrowers to go under would spark a vicious cycle. The first wave of foreclosures would depress housing values, sparking a second and a third wave. Cash-strapped families would be forced to tighten their belts, which in turn would cause spending to collapse. As spending collapsed, businesses would be forced to shrink their operations, lay off workers, and in some cases even go bankrupt. Unemployment would skyrocket, which would in turn lead to more foreclosures. If this scenario sounds familiar, that's because it is exactly what happened during the Great Recession. Starting in 2008, Hubbard and a number of his colleagues at Columbia University, Christopher Mayer most prominent among them, pressed the case for aiding homeowners. They argued that because Congress had, rightly or wrongly, already taken over so much of the mortgage market, the federal government ought to use its power on behalf of families who'd been devastated by the housing bust. Among other things, they called for writing down mortgages for responsible borrowers--not house-flippers or people who lied about their incomes on their mortgage applications, but working families doing their level best to make their payments--with the cost of the write-down to be borne equally by mortgage lenders and taxpayers. Though it might look as though lenders were being forced to make a sacrifice, this approach would have left them much better off, as it would have prevented even more of their loans from going bust. Taxpayers, meanwhile, would have saved enormous amounts of money, as sparing millions of families the pain of foreclosure and joblessness would have held down the costs of unemployment benefits, food stamps, and other transfers designed to keep struggling families afloat. So why didn't Hubbard and Mayer win the argument? Or, put another way: Why did Hubbard's real populism lose out to the fake populism of Santelli and others who maintained that forcing mortgage lenders to accept their share of the blame for the crisis was somehow unfair? One theory is that it was because investors who'd snapped up underwater mortgages were making a huge profit off of them, and they didn't want anyone to come and stop the gravy train. Imagine if the Tea Party movement had taken Hubbard's position and not Rick Santelli's. The last few years of American politics would have looked very different. The Tea Party could still have made the case that President Obama's fiscal stimulus and his health law were alarming examples of government overreach. Yet they also would have demonstrated their willingness to stand up to Wall Street, and their desire to protect the interests of those who'd been hurt most by the housing bust. They might have even helped prevent the catastrophic drop in Hispanic household wealth that, in my view, did far more to turn Latino voters against the GOP than conservative opposition to comprehensive immigration reform. It is too late for the Tea Party to fully undo the damage caused by the Great Recession. But Tea Party conservatives can lead the charge to fix the inflexible debt contracts that are foisted on Americans by Fannie and Freddie and the tax code, and that threaten calamity the next time we have a recession. They can follow the lead of Louisiana Sen. David Vitter, who has called for tough new financial regulations to curb the power of the big banks, and Utah Sen. Mike Lee, who has declared war on corporate welfare. Instead of just paying lip service to fighting crony capitalism, the Tea Party can renew the GOP and American democracy by putting its money where its mouth is.

The Texas governor is thinking about running for president again and he's been on an extended reboot to get himself ready to make the final decision. Lately, though, there has been speculation that his plans might be derailed  by a grand jury investigation into whether he abused the powers of his office. The probe concerns Perry's effort to eject the district attorney of Travis County after she was arrested and convicted of driving while intoxicated. Police video from the arrest last April shows that the DA, whose blood alcohol level was nearly three times the legal limit, was so furious at being booked for driving under the influence that she risked putting officers under the effluence. A spit guard was administered, said officials at the jail, to protect her from herself because she kept sticking out her tongue. What about the allegations? That's a pretty safe question to ask of Republican governors thinking about running for president in 2016. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie faces a long, extended look into the lane closures of the George Washington Bridge. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker faces questions about an old investigation in which his former aides were caught doing political work on government time. Now Perry faces the uncertainty of a special prosecutor and a sitting grand jury. Could this be Perry's Bridgegate? The spit guard may save him. No politician wants a special prosecutor on the prowl. That a judge has put one to work sounds ominous--a fact the Democratic National Committee is trying to exploit--and the industrious fellow with subpoena power may actually find something damaging. The special prosecutor, Mike McCrum, told the Austin American-Statesman that he was ""very concerned"" about what his investigation had uncovered so far, but said no more. Like Christie, Perry must sweat it out while the prosecutor hunts. But unlike Christie, Perry has a story that works in his favor. The story of Perry's legal imbroglio doesn't start with Rick Perry, but with Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg. A year ago she was found in a church parking lot after police received a report about a driver weaving on the road. She was sharing the company of an open bottle of vodka and was given a sobriety test. She failed because she was not in any way sober. ""Don't you know who I am?"" she asked the officers. She also asked them to contact Sheriff Greg Hamilton, between tantrums of kicking the jailhouse door, presumably because she thought Hamilton would get her out of the embarrassing jam. Ultimately, Lehmberg pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 45 days in jail, which she served. Republicans called for Lehmberg to resign. She refused. The governor said that if she did not resign, he would veto $7.5 million in state funding for the Public Integrity Unit that she oversees. (In 2005 the work of the Public Integrity Unit led to the indictment of former U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay; it is the highest government entity that Republicans or Perry don't oversee.) She didn't budge, and Perry made good on the threat, saying she had ""lost the public's confidence."" Austin insiders say there was another reason Perry wanted to oust Lehmberg, an elected Democrat. The Public Integrity Unit was investigating the governor, and with Lehmberg out of office, he could appoint a Republican to the post, which would effectively defang the watchdog. But recent reporting by the Texas Tribune and San Antonio Express-News suggests that Perry's office promised to replace Lehmberg with a Democrat, including one already working in the DA's office, if she stepped down. A watchdog group, Texans for Public Justice, filed a complaint charging that Perry's veto was an abuse of power. A judge agreed there was enough evidence to appoint a special prosecutor, who is looking into both whether Perry tried to coerce a public servant and abused his power. The legal questions involve not only the veto but the public threat that preceded it, and whether the threat rises to the level of a crime under state law. If the special prosecutor finds something we don't know, that could obviously harm Perry politically. He's hired a high-powered lawyer to defend him, so the governor is not leaving anything to chance. But at the moment, this doesn't bear much resemblance to the potentially catastrophic problems Gov. Christie is facing. In Christie's case, when people think about the bridge shutdown, they can imagine their own frustration in traffic. With the Perry story, it's the dangerous and outrageous behavior of the drunken district attorney (which happens to also be on video) that captures the imagination. Unlike in New Jersey, where the governor's aides secretly used their power to punish a petty infraction, Perry made his threat publicly and then followed through on his word. If any primary opponent wants to raise this issue, perhaps by saying Perry tried to eliminate an investigation into his personal integrity, Perry need only repeat a few highlights from Lehmberg's arrest and explain why he thought that didn't make her fit for the job. He will quickly put his opponent in the position of having to defend the dangerous drunk. To any primary voter, this looks like a governor taking charge. For Perry, who would like to remind voters that he was a governor for 14 years, and not a bumbling debate participant for a few short months in 2012, emphasizing this moment of decision-making isn't such a bad thing. Perry has a compelling cinematic story to tell if he is asked to account for himself. Now he just has to hope that the special prosecutor doesn't come up with a better one."

Japan's exceptionally old population--23 percent of it is 65 or older, the largest percentage in the world and almost twice the U.S.'s--may be American joke fodder for now, but we won't be laughing for long. In the next four decades, the populations of the U.S. and most other developed countries are going to be as old as Japan's current population, according recent U.N. data. Increasing longevity and decreasing birthrates together will mean a smaller working-age population must support a growing retired population. That, in turn, may lead to higher taxes on the workforce and reduce capital available for investment elsewhere, cause recessions, and slow recoveries. In the U.S., where the 65-plus population is expected to hit 21 percent by 2050, spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicare is expected to double in the next decade alone. It's no surprise, then, that Japan, where adult diapers are set to start outselling baby diapers, is seriously worried. Some European countries are already grappling with the problem as well. Italy, where people 65 and older account for a fifth of the population, spends more than any other European nation on caring for its old people, equal to more than half of total social spending. Germany has gone so far as to send some retirees abroad to receive long-term care as a way to reduce the immense costs of caring for its aging, dwindling population. For these, the oldest populations, the aging problem will only get worse in the next few decades, according to the U.N. data. In Japan, Italy, and Germany, the 65-plus population will account for a third of the total population by 2050, and Spain will join their ranks. Fortunately, the U.S. population will age more slowly than many others due to a high rate of immigration."	This Map Shows How Fast Old People Are Taking Over the World
8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/oklahoma_sb_1456_why_the_tea_party_is_fighting_for_solar_power.html	"Last week, with little fanfare and even less debate, Oklahoma lawmakers quietly voted to reverse a nearly four-decade-old law that had barred utility companies from charging customers who install solar panels on their homes more than those who don't. The bill, which passed almost unanimously, would have effectively cleared the way for utilities in the Sooner State to force homeowners who install solar panels to pay for both the electricity they buy from the grid and for a portion of the electricity they sell back to it. The vote marked a rare victory for power companies in their quest to stymie the growth of the rooftop solar industry. It also represented a sharp departure from the wave of well-publicized, big-dollar federal and state efforts currently aimed at making solar energy cost competitive with more traditional energy sources like coal and natural gas. Then, on Tuesday, to the surprise of pretty much everyone involved, Oklahoma's Republican governor, Mary Fallin, issued an executive order largely undercutting the provision, dealing an unexpected defeat to major utilities and their deep-pocketed backers--a group that includes the Koch brothers and the American Legislative Exchange Council, a powerful national membership group for conservative state lawmakers. Perhaps the only thing more surprising was who had helped defeat Oklahoma's power companies. Tucked among the usual green suspects were the type of advocates that typically don't associate with the clean energy movement but have nonetheless proved crucial to securing a political victories in a string of dark-red states: Tea Party conservatives. ""Monopoly utilities want to extinguish the independent rooftop solar market in America to protect their socialist control of how we get our electricity,"" blasts the website of Tell Utilities Solar Won't Be Killed, known as TUSK for short. That's not the type of rhetoric you expect conservatives to fire at the power industry. Then again, this isn't your typical renewable energy advocacy group. While it works closely with some of the nation's largest solar panel providers, TUSK is publicly led by Barry Goldwater Jr., the former Republican California congressman and the son of the GOP icon. The group, as its mission statement suggests, has been much more likely to run one of its utility-attacking ads on conservative radio or the Drudge Report than on Mother Jones or MSNBC. (The ads themselves, meanwhile, are significantly more likely to feature two gorillas wrestling.) As unusual as that strategy may seem, it's been a surprisingly effective one. The group boasts an impressive track record of defeating the utility companies' effort to make solar panels less appealing for homeowners through a variety of proposals, from imposing user fees to reducing the price at which consumers can sell their surplus electricity back to the grid. TUSK and its conservative allies have repeatedly found success placing those utility-backed proposals within a free-market frame that speaks directly to conservatives. User fees are just another name for a new tax, argues Goldwater and his outfit; a change to the sale price is just another attempt by the government to limit individual choice, they say. ""They've made a major miscalculation,"" Bryan Miller, the co-chair of the Alliance for Solar Choice, a group working with TUSK, told me shortly after Gov. Fallin's decision, referring to the utility industry's strategy. ""They're making the most liberal of liberal arguments ... something straight out of a John Edwards speech."" The industry argues that anyone who is selling their surplus electricity back to the grid is doing so without having to pay for the wear and tear on the grid itself. That infrastructure upkeep, the utilities say, will be passed on to consumers via their monthly electricity bills, meaning that nonsolar users will have to unfairly foot the bill for their early-adopting neighbors. Such arguments, solar proponents counter, don't fully take into consideration the amount that the utilities themselves benefit from wider solar use, which provides the grid with a clean, reliable source of electricity when it needs it most, during hot, sunny days when residents crank up their air conditioners. TUSK's record, at least as tallied by the group, is now 11-0 following Fallin's executive order, with victories spread out over a large swath of states, most of which were won by Mitt Romney in the 2012 election. You could argue that some of those wins were by TKO and not a knockout--the Oklahoma law still technically leaves the door open for user fees, for example; utilities were able to win a small $5 user fee in Arizona, but not the $50 to $100 one they were originally asking for--but it's difficult to argue that the group hasn't gotten the best of the powerful utility industry despite being heavily outspent at almost ever turn, in some cases by a margin of more than 10-to-1. Utility companies, which burn fossil fuels to produce most of their electricity, aren't necessarily afraid of solar, just those rooftop panels that are increasingly being installed on homes and businesses around the country. (A recent estimate from the solar industry indicated that someone is installing a new solar panel system somewhere in the United States every four minutes, on average.) While solar still accounts for only slightly more than one-tenth of 1 percent of America's electricity, that does little to soothe the fears of utilities, who view rooftop solar panels as an existential threat. The big utility worry is that as more and more solar power-producing homes pay less and less each month, the cost for traditional consumers will go up, making a jump to solar that much more appealing. A report by the Edison Electric Institute, a leading utility group, made it clear that making consumers who sell their surplus back to grid pay more for the privilege was a ""near-term, must-consider action"" for the entire industry. And in the roughly 18 months since that report was published, utilities have done just that. Their chief problem, however, has been that they and their conservative backers have run into unexpected friendly fire. And if they can't sell their anti-solar pitch in red states, they're not likely to have better luck in the blue ones, either."	The Tea Party Wants to Help You Go Solar

Derided as ""Obamacore,"" it's been attacked as a government attempt to usurp local curriculums and impose liberal values on conservative communities. Glenn Beck calls it a plot to turn children into ""cogs"" under a police state, and several Republican politicians have jumped on the bandwagon, denouncing the Obama administration for supporting the standards. If this is confusing to ordinary observers--there's nothing totalitarian about guidelines for what students should know at the end of each grade--it's bewildering for Common Core advocates, who just four years ago were a boring part of the American policy landscape. Common Core was a bipartisan initiative, with support from the vast majority of governors, including Louisiana's Bobby Jindal, who has since reversed course as he preps for a potential 2016 presidential run. What happened to make Common Core an object of hate for conservative activists? The answer is easy: ""The Republican revolt against the Common Core,"" noted the New York Times on Saturday, ""can be traced to President Obama's embrace of it."" That's it. In his 2012 State of the Union, Obama gave a few words of support for the standards. ""For less than 1 percent of what our nation spends on education each year,"" he said, ""we've convinced nearly every state in the country to raise their standards for teaching and learning--the first time that's happened in a generation."" With that, the right-wing outrage machine revved into action, with a grass-roots campaign that has percolated into mainstream politics. The same Sen. Lindsey Graham who recently sponsored a resolution criticizing Common Core wasn't aware it existed when the issue was raised at a GOP meeting last year. But, given his current primary fight against four Tea Party challengers, a stand against Common Core was worth its weight in right-wing credibility. Of course, the Republican about-face on Common Core is only one of many such moves during the Obama presidency. An array of issues enjoyed GOP support until the president agreed with them, including payroll tax breaks for individuals, clean debt-ceiling increases, and immigration reform policies like the DREAM Act. This near-senseless reaction is just one part of a growing tribalism that's consumed the whole of conservative politics. It doesn't matter the issue: If liberals are for it, then--for a large portion of the right--that means it is time to be against it. Take light bulbs. In 2007, Congress approved--and President Bush signed--strict efficiency standards for incandescent light bulbs. The practical impact was to make 100-watt bulbs obsolete: an inconvenience, but not a huge imposition. In any case, the rule wouldn't take effect for a few years, giving homes and businesses a chance to adjust. Industry groups grumbled, but there wasn't any outrage. That changed in 2011, after a Tea Party-fueled Republican Party took the House of Representatives in a landslide victory over the Democratic Party. This coincided with the implementation of the efficiency standards, and the result was a caterwaul of right-wing rage. ""From the health insurance you're allowed to have, to the car you can drive, to the light bulbs you can buy, Washington is making too many decisions that are better left to you and your family,"" declared Texas Rep. Joe Barton when he introduced a bill to reverse the guidelines. ""Instead of a leaner, smarter government, we bought a bureaucracy that now tells us which light bulbs to buy and which may put 16,500 IRS agents in charge of policing President Obama's health care bill,"" said Rep. Michele Bachmann in her response to the president's 2011 State of the Union address, slamming the light bulb change and the Affordable Care Act. Mitt Romney picked up the torch of outrage during his presidential campaign, attacking the government for banning ""Thomas Edison's light bulb."" None of this had anything to do with the merits of changing light bulbs, and everything to do with what it represented, namely, Obama and his liberal do-gooders. What's more, as an energy conservation policy, the light bulb change was associated with climate change, which--to the conservative base--is nothing more than an elaborate hoax, pushed by dishonest scientists and funded by liberal billionaires like George Soros. Indeed, the same dynamic is at work in the world of solar energy, where conservatives--led by the Koch brothers and anti-tax activists--have launched ferocious attacks on states that favor green energy. In Kansas, for instance, the Koch-backed group Americans for Prosperity has led the effort to dismantle a green energy mandate, which requires the state to obtain 20 percent of its energy from renewable sources. As the Los Angeles Times reports, conservative activists are comparing the energy mandate to the individual mandate in Obamacare. Obviously, there are material interests at work here. The Koch brothers are oil magnates with a financial stake in stopping the spread of solar technology, which is cheaper and more effective than it's ever been. At the same time, there's nothing especially political about solar energy; it's an issue with wide appeal to a variety of different groups and interests. If you want clean air, you can support solar. If you want to reduce our dependence on foreign oil--a rallying cry of presidential candidates on both sides--you can support solar, too. But solar is also a tool in the fight against global warming, and to conservative conspiracy-mongers, that's enough to condemn it as a step on the road to serfdom, hence claims from Fox News that the Bureau of Land Management is going after rancher Cliven Bundy to make space for a solar energy project. Totalitarianism on the march! Or something. This tribalism is easy to mock, but it has real consequences for our ability to solve problems or do anything constructive, and not just on a national scale. In Nashville, Tenn., local officials wanted to lay the groundwork for a high-speed bus project that would connect neighboring areas and reduce the pressure on roads and existing buses. The $174 million proposal, called ""The Amp,"" would cut commute times for Nashville residents and had support from business groups and transit advocates. But last week, after sustained activism from the state branch of Americans for Prosperity, the Tennessee Senate passed a bill that--if approved--would kill the project and ""prohibit metropolitan governments and any transit authorities created by a metropolitan government"" from constructing a bus rapid transit system. Treat this as a technocratic dispute, and it doesn't make any sense. If state lawmakers had a problem with The Amp, they could ask local officials to re-evaluate the proposal and look for ways to reduce costs and improve safety. It goes beyond overkill to block the project and preclude Nashville from considering mass transit. But if you treat this as a local front in an unending, all-encompassing culture war, then it's easy to understand. To the right-wing, mass transit is just another liberal attempt to force Americans into a kind of brutalist conformity. ""So why is America's 'win the future' administration so fixated on railroads,"" wrote conservative commentator George Will in an attack on Obama's push for new transit infrastructure. ""Because progressivism's aim is the modification of (other people's) behavior."" Tennessee lawmakers weren't crippling Nashville's attempt to manage its future growth, it was defending its residents from the creeping socialism of public transit. At this point, the tribalist hysteria of the conservative movement is a fixture of American politics, and there's a good chance it gets worse before it gets better. Not only is 2014 an election year, but it's followed by the official start of the Republican presidential primary, and then--in 2016--a full-fledged presidential contest. For the next three years, Republican politicians will be fighting to win support from a conservative base that's rabid for red meat. And if there's an easy path to the prize, it's to find something a liberal likes, and denounce it."	Mass Transit. Common Core. Light Bulbs. Conservatives Hate These Things Because Liberals Like Them.

You can plunk Alabama Rep. Spencer Bachus into the ""pathetic"" column.. In A Fighting Chance, her new memoir, the senator from Massachusetts recalls when she was the hamstrung, unconfirmed adviser who was supposed to run the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Lacking access to the CFPB's full powers, she darted through Congress, taking meetings with skeptics. A 2010 encounter with Bachus--months before he became House Financial Services chairman--stood out to her. ""He spoke movingly about people who had been swindled,"" writes Warren. ""He really seemed to feel their pain. He concluded by saying that if he had more courage, he'd go after the people who did that to families. I was stunned by his use of the word courage and his small, tight, smile."" Was he climbing on board with Warren? Had the wizard given him courage? No and no. Warren remembers his ""accent twanging"" as he explained his next move: ""I'll go after the consumer agency, but I hope you understand, it isn't personal."" Bachus is retiring this year, but scores of people like him populate A Fighting Chance--well-meaning, yearning to agree with her, but crushed by the realities of politics. It's a friendlier book than anyone had reason to expect. Warren's working title was Rigged, as in ""how the economic system's too often rigged against families who work hard and play by the rules."" Those words are still in the book, but the system is something to be conquered, not feared. Warren's previous pop-finance books had called out Democrats, the Clintons especially, for callously tightening bankruptcy laws. Here, as the New Republic's Noam Scheiber has already glumly noted, there's hardly a whisper of that. Warren spends no time criticizing Clinton and quite a lot of time praising the Democrats (even John Edwards!) who listened to her ideas. She credits Bill Clinton with putting her on a commission that delayed, for a decade, a bill to make it harder to declare bankruptcy. In 2002, when a version of the bill goes down, she remembers exactly what Sen. Ted Kennedy told her: ""We showed those #*&!!s. They shouldn't mess with us!"" Us. In 2005, when the bill passes, Warren names no names and blames no particular politicians. That's considerably less than Barack Obama did when he ran for president, and Obama himself comes off well here. A scene in which he sits Warren down and asks her to ""trust your president"" and take an advisory CFPB job is about how steadfast he is, not about how the current president didn't fight hard enough for consumers. Of course, Warren is not running for president. She's the most exciting and eloquent figure on the political left, and progressives cling to her brand whenever they can. The monomania of the political press corps demands that such a figure must run for the nation's highest office because there's no other way to change the Democratic Party or--well, to make the media cover what Warren stands for. Warren begs to differ. Her book is a sort of ruse, clothed in the jacket of a precampaign biography but designed to depoliticize its subject. It spins the clock back, to a time when Warren wasn't even identified with ""the left."" As recently as 2011, conservative (not Republican) writers were praising Warren's research on the banks and advocacy for the middle class. She wanted to make it affordable to start a family and not fear being wiped out. How was that left-wing? ""Her understanding of the financial crisis is best described as populist, conservative, even right-wing,"" wrote Christopher Caldwell in The Weekly Standard, after Warren finally gave up on being appointed to run the CFPB. ""She was the only white working-class Democrat left in captivity."" She's still in captivity. She's in politics. The political world, for Warren, is a Lewis Carroll derp-o-sphere where no one can focus on what matters. Her 2012 Senate race makes up only 64 of the book's 277 pages, with plenty of digressions about where she ate (""We refueled at Burger King or Chipotle"") and how she sought solace from her grandkids or her dog (""I started sitting on the floor and gently combing Otis and rubbing his belly while I talked to people miles away."") The remaining pages make up the book's only slog. Warren keeps repeating the same lessons--she met inspiring people, and the media refused to cover what mattered. Surprise, surprise, she was ""hurt"" when Republicans attacked her for stating a Native American ancestry on her old law school job applications. What hurt more was that the story broke simultaneously with the JPMorgan Chase ""London Whale""--the scandal caused by trader Bruno Iksil, who earned the nickname because of the size of his bets. As a result, Warren's ""encounters with the press during this period were dominated by questions about my mother's background--almost nobody asked about Jamie Dimon's recklessness."" What a contrast with the people she worked with in the academic world, or even the commissions she got with the government. Warren recalls everything about how she got those jobs and uses them to quickly summarize the research on why people go broke, and the reasons, like ""mortgages that zoom from unbelievably low monthly payments to unbelievably high monthly payments."" Yes, Warren confirms that she wanted to be recess-appointed to run the CFPB. The administration got that one wrong--it was bamboozled, by Republicans, into dumping her and promoting another nominee who they blocked anyway. (Richard Cordray floated in limbo from late 2011 until the first Senate filibuster deal of 2013.) Again, the structural problem identified by Warren is a GOP that's simply misguided, or scared of the bankers. These are separate but overlapping tragedies. The bankers never tell Warren why they oppose her. They just send representatives to all of her public hearings on bankruptcy and attempt to bait her into a debate with a lobbyist. (She refuses.) One congressman, whom Warren does not name, literally recites financial industry talking points to her in a private meeting. Another congressman, New York's Michael Grimm, seems to oppose her work out of pure ignorance. ""When I launched into an enthusiastic description of what we were trying to get done at the agency,"" she writes, ""the congressman looked surprised. After a bit, he cut me off so he could make one thing clear: He didn't believe in government."" In a fit of esprit de l'escalier, Warren runs through all the government services that Grimm surely uses and wonders why he can't see that regulating the banks is exactly like putting cops on drug corners. Surely he can be taught. Warren's memoir reads a bit like The Payoff, Jeff Connaughton's story of his lobbying career and the two-year Senate residency of Delaware's Ted Kaufman. Both books contain head-shaking anecdotes about banks attempting to rebut decades of studies with junk data that they paid for; both portray members of Congress as gibbering ideologues. Connaughton concluded that the system was, well, rigged. Warren decides that the people running the system are so blatant in their venality, laziness, and graft that they can be beaten. That's the battle. Leave the White House to some other sucker."	Sen. Elizabeth Warren's Memoir Is Cheerier Than You'd Expect from a Leftist Champion
11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/paul_krugman_offered_225_000_salary_that_s_a_bargain_rate.html	"Paul Krugman may be America's foremost public intellectual. He's certainly a contender for the title. He has done more than any other thinker to sound the alarm about rising income inequality in the United States, and in doing so he has shaped the worldview of a generation of liberals. Krugman's influence reflects more than just the stylishness of his writing or his reach as a widely read columnist for the New York Times. It also rests on his sterling academic credentials. Among other laurels, Krugman has been awarded the Nobel Prize and the John Bates Clark Medal, the highest distinctions available to a living economist. The esteem in which Krugman is held among his fellow scholars lends his arguments an authority that delights those inclined to agree with him--and drives those disinclined to do so, myself very much included, up the wall. So when Gawker reported that Krugman was offered $225,000 to join the faculty of the City University of New York's Graduate Center, at least some of Krugman's critics saw an opportunity to knock ""Krugtron the Invincible"" down a peg or two. Was he not aware that CUNY is a publicly funded institution that pays bona fide full-time professors far less than Krugman was being offered to essentially serve as a mascot for the school's new inequality initiative--a mascot with a truly minimal teaching load? If Krugman cares so much about income inequality, his detractors wondered, why would he accept such a sum for doing so little work? And as someone who has done so much to draw attention to the evils of ""the undeserving rich,"" how could the offer not leave him feeling like at least a little bit of a jerk? But this is one case where I think Krugman is in the right and his critics are in the wrong. Not only should he have had no compunction about accepting CUNY's offer--he would have been entirely justified in asking for more. And doing so should have no bearing on his credibility as a scourge of rising inequality. When Krugman announced he was leaving Princeton to join the CUNY faculty back in February, it was a big deal. Princeton, one of the country's most storied, selective, and elite private research universities, was losing its most celebrated social scientist to a public institution that prided itself on its inclusiveness and its democratic spirit. Krugman emphasized that though he'd very much appreciated his time at Princeton, he was attracted by the opportunity to devote more time and effort to the study of income inequality. To that end, he sought an affiliation with the Luxembourg Income Study, a think tank that gathers and analyzes data on income, wealth, and employment from a number of countries to draw meaningful cross-national comparisons. It just so happens that the LIS is led by Janet Gornick, a professor of political science and sociology at the Graduate Center. One thing led to another, and Krugman wound up with not just a LIS affiliation, but also with a faculty position at the Graduate Center. Understandably, Krugman chose not to disclose any financial details in his announcement. But one can read between the lines. The LIS does difficult, expensive, thankless work, and attracting a scholar of Krugman's stature would do much to raise its profile. The Graduate Center is home to a number of well-regarded scholars, yet it is not generally seen as competitive with other major research universities with deeper pockets. Krugman's value to CUNY wouldn't be that he is willing to devote a great deal of time and energy to educating graduate students, so it's not surprising that the Graduate Center didn't ask him to devote a significant portion of his time to that end. Rather, his value lies in his ability to raise the school's profile--to attract other faculty members, to attract high-caliber graduate students, and, perhaps most importantly, to attract donors who share Krugman's convictions concerning income inequality, or who at least find it useful to appear to share his convictions. Viewed through this lens, CUNY's offer to Krugman looks like a bargain. One thing to keep in mind is that Krugman is most likely taking a salary cut by leaving Princeton for CUNY. We don't know what Princeton paid Krugman, but we can ballpark it. The University of California is one of many public universities that provides information on how much it pays its employees, and a quick look reveals a number of faculty members who haven't received Krugman's accolades but who are being paid quite a bit more than CUNY offered to pay Krugman. Having followed the academic job market closely for some years now, I can tell you that even Berkeley, the crown jewel of California's public university system, finds it difficult to match the salaries offered by schools like Princeton, with its $17 billion endowment. And then there are the bloated salaries public universities routinely offer athletic coaches. Far be it from me to suggest that Paul Krugman will do as much for CUNY as basketball coach John Calipari does for the University of Kentucky. But Calipari earned $5.4 million in 2012. Isn't it possible that Krugman might be worth one-twenty-fourth as much as Calipari? Or maybe even a little bit more? As Krugman has made clear on more than one occasion, his quarrel is not with members of the top 5 percent or even with members of the top 1 percent. The real problem, in his view, lies with the top 0.01 percent, a category dominated by executives, especially those who work in finance. These are the people with the resources to manipulate political outcomes and entrench their power and that of their descendants. I happen to think that Krugman is wrong about the threat posed by this kind of dynastic wealth, but he has made it absolutely clear that he sees this threat as separate and distinct from the wage gains experienced by upper-middle-income professionals. According to Krugman, the main thing that we as a society should do about upper-middle-income professionals, or rather upper-upper-middle-income professionals, is raise their taxes. And who doubts that Krugman would happily pay a higher marginal tax rate? There is a moral framework that would make Krugman's (apparent) willingness to accept CUNY's offer look damning. In If You're an Egalitarian, How Come You're So Rich?, the political philosopher G.A. Cohen argued that we as individuals shouldn't just favor institutions that are designed to maximize the well-being of the poorest among us, like, say, a progressive tax code. Rather, all of the choices we make should serve this end, whether or not the right institutions are in place. So short of donating every cent he earns above what he needs to survive, Krugman would indeed be failing as an inequality fighter by Cohen's rigorous standard. But then, who wouldn't?"

12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/barack_obama_trolls_the_gop_the_president_intentionally_baited_republicans.html	"How do I get you to pay attention to this story? I could type out a balanced tale about an incremental change in White House spin and message control, relying on your discernment, patience, and kindness toward all the creatures of the Earth. Or, I could say that Barack Obama is a cynical and manipulative liar. The first approach would get a modest number of thoughtful readers, but they probably wouldn't stay on the page very long. The second would excite the emotions. Conservatives would approve. Liberals would denounce it and point out the exaggerations. My editor would smile because the controversy would attract more readers. This is trolling. I've decided against it, but the White House has not. CBS's Major Garrett writes in National Journal about a new version of the ""stray voltage"" theory of communication in which the president purposefully overstates his case knowing that it will create controversy. Garrett describes it this way: ""Controversy sparks attention, attention provokes conversation, and conversation embeds previously unknown or marginalized ideas in the public consciousness."" The issue last week was the pay gap between men and women. The president issued executive orders to address the disparity, and Democrats pushed legislation in Congress. In making the case, the president and White House advisers used a figure they knew to be imprecise and controversial--a Census Bureau statistic that the median wages of working women in America are 77 percent of median wages earned by men. Under this approach, a president wants the fact-checkers to call him out (again and again) because that hubbub keeps the issue in the news, which is good for promoting the issue to the public. It is the political equivalent of ""there is no such thing as bad publicity"" or the quote attributed to Mae West (and others): ""I don't care what the newspapers say about me as long as they spell my name right."" The tactic represents one more step in the embrace of cynicism that has characterized President Obama's journey in office. Officials in every White House crowbar the facts to make their cases. Administration officials over time have also learned how to turn lemons into lemonade, harnessing the frenzied news coverage from a perceived White House miscue to the president's advantage. Losing the news cycles between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. doesn't necessarily matter; if by the end of the saga you've got a coherent story to pitch, the frenzy has simply given you a larger audience who will listen to it. ""Stray voltage,"" the term Obama strategist David Plouffe used to describe this approach, is also a great buzzword that makes it look like you've got a theory for what might otherwise look like chaos. But this twist is a new, higher order of deception: creating the controversy for the purposes of milking it. Facts, schmacts. As long as people are talking about an issue where my party has an advantage with voters, it's good. So, the theory goes, if I'm a Republican candidate, I benefit from conversations about budget deficits and spending restraint because voters trust Republicans more on the issue of the budget and spending restraint, and it excites Republican voters who care about those issues. Democrats have several reasons to keep stories about equal-pay equity in the news. It excites their voters, attracts female voters, and crowds out whatever the Republicans wanted to talk about (these days, Obamacare). It also sets a trap. The more Republicans have to talk about politically unfavorable issues, the greater chance they'll slip up and say something dumb like candidates Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock did that can be exploited more broadly. Even if I've overstated the issue, more voters will hear that Democrats are fighting to pay women equally than will hear that the problem is overstated. Even if Ruth Marcus labels the effort ""revolting demagoguery,"" it doesn't matter. In fact, equal-pay stories that create more controversy cycles about stories rooted in equal pay are just more opportunities for people to hear the words equal pay. See that? Equal pay. That may or may not work with voters. It's usually associated with the planned cynicism of campaigns, where if your attack ad isn't getting four Pinocchios, you're doing it wrong. In governing, there is usually a policy process that puts a brake on using bad numbers. Presidents also worry that people won't think they are honest and trustworthy if they keep using facts that don't pan out. But we are in a campaign year in which Democrats are struggling to find an issue they can use as a weapon against Republicans who have the upper hand. After President Obama took office, his campaign book The Audacity of Hope receded into his past fast. Its sweet, naive, bipartisan ""let's reason together"" passages fell away, too. As experience and a determined opposition forced the president to act, his former passages started to read like something a freshman senator would write, then a college graduate, and then a college freshman. With the notion of ""stray voltage"" in mind, the passages read like they're from a precocious high-schooler chiding the press for treating facts so loosely that the cumulative effect is to ""erode any agreed-upon standards for judging the truth."" It is a pity, writes the author, that politicians prey on press conflict by feeding misleading storylines. ""It rewards not those who are right, but those--like the White House press office--who can make their arguments most loudly, most frequently, most obstinately, and with the best backdrop."""

13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/how_long_is_the_tax_code_it_is_far_shorter_than_70_000_pages.html	"In a perfect world, there would be no need to have an argument over how long a book is. You would think it should be a pretty objective inquiry. But not for the tax code, a book whose length has been hyper-inflated by journalists and others as a proxy for the complexity of our tax system. So how long is the tax code? I'm an attorney at Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation, and I have the tax code sitting next to me as I write this. This particular version, published by Thomson Reuters, is a big book, but it is only one volume. American Public Media's Marketplace Morning Report has reported that the tax code is 70,000 pages long.* The New York Times thinks so too. A Google search will find this number repeated again and again in the popular press. I have never seen a book that is 70,000 pages long, and I seriously doubt that such a book exists. So please be assured that the tax code is not 70,000 pages long. So, how long is it? In the 2013 edition, the last page is numbered 4,037. Now, that's not exactly right either, for two reasons: The book starts at page 100, and then skips 500 pages in its numbering (don't ask me why), and this volume (like all other volumes I've ever seen) contains both the present-day tax laws and prior versions of the tax law. That is because tax lawyers like me often find it useful to refer to prior versions of the law. But the compilation of those old laws isn't really the ""tax code""--it's just a resource for lawyers. I'd estimate that the old law takes up about 800 pages. So let's say the tax code is about 2,600 pages long. It's like 21/2 times the length of Stephen King's It--except you replace ""scary clown"" with ""accounting methods."" So where did this 70,000 page statistic come from? After a bit of research, I have narrowed it down to one source: Our good friends over at the Tax Foundation, a tax policy research organization, who cite the ""pages in the CCH Standard Federal Tax Reporter."" That means nothing to 99 percent of readers, but I assure you that it is patently ridiculous. The CCH Standard Federal Tax Reporter is an enormous collection of resources compiled for tax lawyers and accountants. It is immensely useful, but it is not the tax code. True, it does contain the tax code, but it also contains legislative history, Treasury Regulations, editorial commentary, and collected court cases on each topic. Calling it the tax code is like calling the Constitution the length of the collected Supreme Court cases on constitutional law--or like calling the alphabet the length of the dictionary. To give you an idea of how far afield the CCH Standard Federal Tax Reporter is from being the tax code, take this example: Tax code section 7402 is titled ""Jurisdiction of District Courts."" This is a very short code section, and it has few associated Treasury Regulations. The CCH volume provides the text of the statute (that is, the text from the actual tax code), which takes up just half a page of text. After additional editorial material, it includes annotated court cases related to the jurisdictional issues--191 pages of them. But is it even useful to talk about a document's length as a stand-in for its complexity? The Harry Potter series was quite long, but I'm pretty sure I caught most of the nuance (although admittedly I missed this). By comparison, Faulkner's As I Lay Dying is quite compact, but to this day I have no idea what it's about (was his mother really a fish?). And, not to put too fine a point on it, but the tax code has a table of contents, and doesn't require you to start on Page 1. This may or may not be true for As I Lay Dying. I'm still not really sure. Correction, April 15, 2014: This article originally misstated the name of the American Public Media program Marketplace Morning Report. (Return.)"	How Long Is the Tax Code?

They spend some of their 24-hour alerts seated in front of steel Minuteman III missile launch control panels mounted on shock absorbers, with toggle switches capable of hurling 10 to 50 nuclear warheads--each with 20 times the explosive force of the Hiroshima bomb--to the other side of the globe, at speeds of 15,000 mph. But their day-to-day enemy, for decades, has not so much been another superpower, but the unremitting boredom of an isolated posting that demands extreme vigilance, while also requiring virtually no activity, according to accounts by missileers and a new internal review of their work. That understandable boredom, when paired with the military's sky-high expectations for their workplace performance, has pushed some of them to use drugs, others to break the rules, and still more to look for any way out. The millennials who populate this force can watch television, read, study, or sleep in their cramped, often damp quarters. But their checklist routines are typically unvarying, and their moment-to-moment responsibilities are few, and the temperature underground--like the policy requiring their presence--is unnervingly stuck in the mid-60s. Referring implicitly to the officers' ability to wreak almost unimaginable destruction on foreign populations, Col. Robert Vercher, the commander of a missile wing at North Dakota's Minot Air Force Base, told the Air Force's news service in February that ""there is no other Air Force unit, other than our sister ICBM wings, where we put this much responsibility on very junior Airmen."" Their official job criteria require that they have a ""positive attitude toward nuclear weapons duty."" Those who don't feel up to detonating such warheads are generally referred either to chaplains, legal counsels, or ""mental health clinicians,"" the Air Force says, to try and set them straight. Moreover, until recently, the Air Force's policy dogma for the force--dating at least from a 2007 episode in which the command lost track of six nuclear warheads fitted atop cruise missiles for a day--is that mistakes cannot be made. ""Perfection is the expectation"" for ""America's frontline missile operators,"" an article from the Air Education and Training Command stated in late 2011. ""In what you do every day, there is no room for error, none,"" Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel reiterated during a visit to Wyoming's F.E. Warren Air Force Base three months ago. But now--when the national nightmare typically involves a terrorist's smuggled bomb on the subway rather than another nation's missile attack over the North Pole--even the Air Force admits that motivating these young officers to fulfill the service's standard of perfection in their ICBM knowledge and skills is essentially an unachievable goal. Lt. Gen. James M. Holmes, a former fighter pilot who is now vice commander of the Air Force's training command, acknowledged as much in a revealing 268-page report he completed in February about the grim life of the missileers. Senior Air Force leaders, he said, had repeatedly ordered a ""zero defect"" nuclear culture that is ""unrealistic and unobtainable."" The consequence of making such demands was not to improve performance but to worsen morale and promote dishonesty, the report concluded. ""Leadership's focus on perfection led commanders to micromanage their people ... imposing an unrelenting testing and inspections [regime] with the goal of eliminating all human error,"" Lt. Gen. Stephen Wilson, commander of the Air Force's Global Strike Command, said as he endorsed the Holmes report, which was released in late March. ""This approach is unrealistic."" The Air Force is now planning to ask for less perfection from its 9,600-member missile corps, a result that is practical, or perhaps inevitable, given the job's inherent limitations, even if it is also a disquieting standard for a group with its fingers on such consequential buttons. Ecstasy and amphetamines Holmes' report was sparked by an Air Force probe of drug dealing by two lieutenants in contact with the nuclear missile workforce, which began last August and quickly blossomed into an investigation of widespread cheating on the missileers' proficiency tests at the Malmstrom Air Force Base, a Montana facility with 150 nuclear-tipped Minuteman III missiles. The drug-dealing probe--which may be the most alarming aspect of the current tumult--remains open, and the Air Force has said little about it. But the two officers at its center, both in administrative jobs, allegedly sent messages to 11 others about ""specific, illegal drug use ... [including] synthetic drugs, ecstasy, and amphetamines,"" according to the Holmes report. Two of those who received these messages about drugs at Malmstrom were combat crew members--those with responsibility for actually launching Minuteman missiles, according to a spokeswoman for the Global Strike Command that oversees the missile force. Another recipient was a missile combat crew member at Warren, which has another 150 Minuteman IIIs. The Defense Department likes absolutes, at least in its policies. It has a stated zero tolerance for drug abuse and mandates frequent urine testing for its nuclear weapons officers. But drug use of some kind has a long history in the nuclear missile corps, according to Bruce Blair, a former deputy missile combat crew commander who is now a research scholar at Princeton University and advocates eliminating the Minuteman force. During his four years at Malmstrom in the early 1970s, Blair recalled recently, he sometimes passed the time by eavesdropping on radio chatter by security guards on patrol. He discovered their discussions were often about where to find bags of pot deliberately stashed near missile silos. On his final day on alert in a launch capsule in 1974, Blair added, security officers with dogs swept through the command quarters overhead and snagged the cook, the security chief, and the facility manager. ""Everybody [topside] was high,"" Blair said. ""They were all relieved of duty."" A spokesman at Malmstrom said the base had no records of incidents that old. But ridding the missile corps of all drug or alcohol abuse is clearly a steep challenge, given that between 14 and 20 percent of Americans in their 20s have told federal surveyors they recently used illicit drugs. The Air Force's rulebook states that drug dealing and the use of hallucinogens or any other drug that might cause ""flashbacks"" are grounds for permanent removal. But the service can be forgiving of those involved in drug and alcohol incidents that fall short of what it considers ""abuse"" and ""dependency."" These personnel can be reinstated to critical nuclear weapons positions if they undergo rehabilitation and ""display positive changes in job reliability and lifestyle."" Drug or alcohol abuse, and other problematic behavior, is meant to be caught by the Defense Department's Personnel Reliability Program, which screens and monitors all those with access to nuclear weapons and technical knowledge about them. Eighteen years after the incident described by Blair, nearly 4 percent of the nuclear workforce--or about 2,600 individuals--were typically ""decertified"" every year, for reasons that included ""substance abuse, negligence, conviction of a serious offense, and poor physical or mental condition,"" according to a 1992 report by the congressional watchdog agency then known as the General Accounting Office. ""During our review ... we found cases where individuals had been certified for nuclear-related positions despite evidence that they had been convicted for driving while intoxicated or they had admitted to pre-service drug use,"" the GAO's report stated. At one base visited, investigators found six of 54 personnel had pre-service drug use, mostly involving pot, because the rules at the time allowed precisely six ""pre-service experimental"" tokes per person. Fifteen years later, when the nuclear weapons workforce was much smaller, annual decertifications had dropped to 1.83 percent, or about 310 personnel from all three services, according to a 2009 Defense Science Board report, including 140 in critical missile launch or maintenance positions. No details about why these workers were removed in 2007 have been made public, nor does the department publish decertification data from other years. But last year, according to the Global Strike Command public affairs office, fewer than 30 officers were decertified from critical, nuclear weapons-related, bomber and missile launch or maintenance positions in the Air Force. Four of these were for drug-related problems. An additional 275 or so members of the command's security force--roughly 4 percent--were also decertified that year, including 31 for drug-related problems. Crushing the rules violators The Air Force has tried to lend morale-boosting drama to the 50-year-old Minuteman launch jobs, with a colonel flogging the missileers in an email last April to act like they're on a ""go-to-war team"" and a visiting general comparing them in a March speech to Babe Ruth or Ty Cobb, always ready to ""knock one out of the park."" It also asks its missile combat crews to spend about 40 days a year in a $9.7 million launch simulator at Vandenberg Air Force Base, where they are supposed to become acclimated to reading codes, turning keys, and flipping the switches that would bring death to millions. But many missileers dislike the assignment, and chafe at being stuck underground for so much of their four-year tours, with little hope of rapid advancement or deployment to a more interesting location. Their chief opportunity, after the first two years, is to shift to the chair next to them, moving from deputy launch commander to commander. What they most want to do is to sit ""fewer alerts,"" as recent Air Force focus groups have revealed. In trying to create a happier workforce, the Air Force has known for years that it faces long odds: ""The most difficult issue and the one with the most long-term implications is the widespread perception in both the Navy and Air Force that a nuclear forces career is not the highly promising opportunity of the past era,"" an internal Pentagon study concluded in 1998. By 2008, when the Defense Science Board surveyed more than 8,000 nuclear weapons personnel, the Air Force in particular had lower morale than the other services. Just 37 percent said they wanted to perform ""nuclear deterrence related work"" until they retired--compared with 62 and 83 percent of those surveyed in the Navy and Army, respectively--and fewer in the Air Force said they were willing to recommend their organization as a good place to work. A confidential study by the RAND Corp. last year confirmed that behavioral and morale problems were more severe among missile force members than others within the Air Force, according to an Associated Press account. The court martial rate among missileers was more than double the overall Air Force rate in 2011 and 2012, as were rates of spousal abuse, although the Air Force says the rates have since declined. But the pale motivation and weak discipline of some missileers came more forcefully to the public's attention last May, when a missile group commander at Minot Air Force Base wrote a lacerating email to his combat crew members that leaked to the Associated Press. Calling attention to low scores during recent inspections--including some marginal performances in the missile launch simulator--Lt. Col. Jay Folds wrote that ""we're discovering such rot in the crew force"" that officers from other missile fields were being summoned ""to come pull alerts at Minot while we fix ourselves."" Folds demanded that his missileers ""crush any rules violators,"" including those ""that do so on purpose."" He told them to turn off their televisions and improve their test performance, and to stop leaving missile silo blast doors open while they slept--a routine that launch capsule veterans say has long been commonplace, despite the obvious security risks. ""No more questioning the rules and orders of the officers appointed over you!"" Folds ordered in the email, according to a full copy obtained by the Center for Public Integrity, promising ""consequences"" for those who continued to ""bad mouth"" their work. ""Gone is ... the environment where we handed things to you on a silver platter because we thought that's the way you take care of the crew force."" Seventeen combat crew officers were pulled from alert duty for two months. In subsequent months the missile force's problems--and public awareness of them--only worsened. When investigators probing the alleged drug ring seized the cellphones of suspects at Malmstrom, they discovered that dozens of lieutenants on missile combat crews had been exchanging questions and answers from their proficiency tests for nearly two years. The tests, administered every month, covered the handling of codes, missile operations, and responding to ""emergency war orders""--the authority to unleash nuclear destruction.  Ten officers had texted or received a classified test answer without safeguards. They did so, the Holmes report said, because they needed perfect scores to be promoted to other, aboveground Air Force jobs. Senior Air Force officers responded in March by ordering nine of that base's group and squadron leaders--all colonels and lieutenant colonels--removed from alert duties, on the grounds that they were not monitoring their crews sufficiently to detect the cheating. The overall commander of Malmstrom's missile wing resigned. As for Folds, a year after berating his missile crews he is no longer in his post, having accepted an academic fellowship at Harvard University. Meanwhile, the Air Force has decided a gentler management approach is better-suited to keeping the millennials happy. ""Occasionally, we're going to ... [swing] and miss, and I'm OK with that,"" Wilson, the Global Strike Command head, startlingly told Malmstrom's missileers during a Feb. 26 visit. ""I'm good with striking out--that's what makes us better. It is OK to fail."" The Air Force also decided to refurbish more launch control centers, revise some of its testing materials, and try to create more attractive career paths. The Personnel Reliability Program has been overhauled to strip away some higher-level reporting requirements and push oversight and decision-making down to the local commands. In taking a wider view of the test cheating problem, Holmes wrote that he was following the ""Reason Model of Human Error."" That's a slightly garbled name for the theory propounded in 1990 by University of Manchester social psychologist James T. Reason that complex systems--particularly those with highly perfected mechanical devices at their heart--can fail, sometimes catastrophically, due to mistakes made by the executives who create and manage them. Reason's insights from studying air traffic controllers, hospitals, and nuclear power plants prompted him to be hired by railways and airlines in an effort to anticipate when poor supervisory practices--including excessive corner-cutting, undue budget reductions, and the setting of unrealistic performance expectations--might culminate in unsafe acts. One of his most famous presentations included a series of Swiss cheese slices, representing checks and safeguards, with the holes unexpectedly lined up so that a catastrophe could still occur. But while the Air Force has embraced this theory in name, its leadership still rejects any suggestion that its complex missile system has any inherent flaws, that cheating or other problems are widespread at the two other missile bases, or that workers' shortcomings at Malmstrom were well-known up the chain of command. ""There was a few, handful of people that were at the crux of this problem,"" Wilson, head of the Global Strike Command, told reporters on March 27, mentioning four in particular, three of whom he said were involved with drugs. The missile wing commander who resigned, Col. Robert W. Stanly II, struck a similar theme in a grumpy resignation note saying ""just one solitary airman"" could have let any higher-ups know of the rule-breaking, so they could have leapt into action. He said the ""extraordinary selfish actions of officers entrusted with the most powerful weapon system ever devised"" had kept everything hidden. ""Really unhappy"" missileers A somewhat different account is buried in the bowels of the Holmes report. It says that focus groups and a survey at Malmstrom indicated that many of those who passed through the training at Vandenberg were ""conditioned"" to expect test coaching at the missile bases. Many crew members believed test sharing was widespread and that the rewards justified the risks. Sixty percent said their squadron leaders knew about it. ""Cheating has been going on for years; however, leadership pretends that the cheating is not happening,"" said one of the focus group participants. ""You can talk yourself into doing things that you wouldn't ordinarily do because you see a culture of compromises and a leadership that's aware of what's going on and tolerates it,"" said another. After the embarrassing RAND Corp. report on low morale last year, the commander who oversaw the entire 450-missile Minuteman III force, Maj. Gen. Michael J. Carey, told the Associated Press that morale at Minot is ""not bad"" and that missileers there are ""not unhappy."" But the following month, when Carey joined seven other American officials on an official trip to Moscow, he told them that ""his group had the worst morale"" and the Air Force's leadership ""wasn't supporting him,"" according to an October 2013 report by the service's inspector general. ""They've done a study and saw that his ... you know, the missile bases or everyone is really unhappy,"" one of the Americans on the trip quoted him as saying. ""He is trying to make it better and leadership is not helping out and not listening to him."" It's true Air Force leaders are not listening to Carey today. He was removed from his post after the service's inspectors concluded he engaged in inappropriate behavior on the trip besides publicly savaging his Air Force superiors. Specifically, witnesses said he drank excessively, including from an open vodka bottle handed to him by his hosts; he insistently demanded that the band at a Mexican restaurant in the Russian capital let him sing or play the guitar onstage; and he repeatedly sat or walked with Russians instead of members of his own group, including several attractive women who showed up at two restaurants and kissed him on the cheek. According to the report, he also spent most of an evening talking with the cigar shop saleswoman at the Moscow Marriott hotel who he later recalled ""was asking questions about physics and optics."" He said he recalled thinking, ""Dude, this normally doesn't happen."" The lesson appears to be that there's no immunity, among the missileers at various ranks, from poor judgment and low spirits while pursuing their marginalized profession.

15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/republicans_want_to_impeach_president_obama_for_benghazi_gop_fears_they.html	"On Saturday night, as Washington's press corps was distracted by a surge of celebrity selfie opportunities, it was missing a kind of milestone. Jeanine Pirro, a former New York Republican star who tumbled out of politics and onto Fox News, was calling for the impeachment of President Obama over ""a story no one wants to talk about.""* The story was the 2012 attack on the American consulate in Benghazi. Referring to that, on Fox, as ""a story no one wants to talk about"" sounded a bit like CNN asking where all the Flight 370 coverage had been. Not Pirro's point--she was saying that the media failed to see where the Benghazi story was going to lead. Hint: Impeachment. ""We have impeached a president for lying about sex with an intern,"" she said. ""A president resigned in the face of certain impeachment for covering up a burglary. Why wouldn't we impeach this president for not protecting and defending Americans in the bloodbath known as Benghazi?"" Pirro then addressed the president directly--though at this point in the evening he was giving a sardonic dinner speech--with a warning that ""your dereliction of duty as commander-in-chief demands your impeachment."" Just one segment on a slow news night, but there was a sense of inevitability about it, of the Overton Window being shifted by hand. Ever since the aftermath of the Benghazi attacks, Republicans and conservatives have compared the Obama administration's on-the-ground failure and intra-office spin job to Watergate. Politicos compare contemporary scandals to Watergate for one of two reasons: Laziness, or to gently raise the specter of impeachment. The only thing that tamps down impeachment talk is the fear of a backlash, of looking crazy--of looking like former Rep. Dan Burton, basically. Ever since Republicans took back the House of Representatives, Speaker of the House John Boehner has fretted that one of their investigations would veer into the same fever swamp where Burton shot at pumpkins to re-enact theories about the death of Vince Foster. Boehner, elected in 1990, remembers how Republicans bet the entire 1998 election on the impeachment of Bill Clinton, and how their subsequent surprise defeat ended the speakership of Newt Gingrich. ""We're probably one email away from Benghazi being an impeachable offense for much of our party,"" fretted Republican lobbyist Ed Rogers in 2012, right after Obama's re-election. ""I think that's nuts, but that's where we are right now."" That's why Boehner's endorsement of the select committee on Benghazi was so significant. ""At one time,"" former Rep. Pete Hoekstra told Newsmax, ""Speaker Boehner said, if there's any indication that that this leads to the White House, you know we're going to go after this."" Boehner knew that Democrats would spend the next few months or years deriding a ""witch hunt,"" just as they mocked the Clinton impeachment. And that's also why the backup from Fox News matters, and why more conservatives will join the discussion. Next month the attorney and National Review columnist Andrew McCarthy will publish Faithless Execution: Building the Political Case for Obama's Impeachment. ""There is a rich legal case,"" writes McCarthy, ""but impeachment is not about what the law allows. Impeachment is a matter of political will."" McCarthy's book is brief and structured around seven potential articles of impeachment, which accuse the president of everything from ""usurping the constitutional authority of prerogatives of Congress"" (for example, making recess appointments when Boehner refused to recess the House) to ""failure to execute the immigration laws faithfully"" to, inevitably, ""the Benghazi fraud."" Most of the scandals cited by McCarthy faded under the klieg lights of big media, but he puts some of the blame for that on Republicans. He cites a 2013 event with Sen. Ted Cruz in which a constituent asked why Obama couldn't be impeached and the senator called it a ""good question."" Impeachment, writes McCarthy is ""not a high mountain to climb,"" because Republicans will keep control of the House at least through Obama's presidency. The struggle is building the consensus of 1974, of making it impossible for 67 senators not to follow the House's impeachment vote by voting to remove the president. Republicans failed to do that in 1999, after the House gave them the first trial of a president in 131 years. ""The GOP had better get past its angst,"" writes McCarthy. ""Either that or be prepared to accept a government that is more a centralized dictatorship than a federalist republic under the rule of law."" He's not writing anything that key Republicans haven't said. Last year, when the Obama administration delayed some key Affordable Care Act deadlines, some House conservatives started talking the patois of impeachment. ""The President is rewriting his own law, even though the law doesn't provide him the authority to do so,"" warned Judiciary Chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte after a winter 2013 hearing. ""As James Madison warned centuries ago in Federalist 47, 'the accumulation of all powers legislative, executive and judiciary, in the same hands ... may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.' "" But getting from the wisdom of the founders to a full-on impeachment is tricky. Former Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich discovered that after Democrats took Congress in 2007, and he introduced articles to impeach President George W. Bush largely over the conduct of the war in Iraq. ""Everything I said in those articles was absolutely correct,"" Kucinich says today. ""Time has borne that out. The Democratic leadership made a political decision not to proceed with the impeachment of George Bush but I think it was one of the big mistakes the Democratic Party made. It did not provide for true accountability of checks and balances."" At the time, Republicans literally laughed off the Kucinich threat, and Democrats gave him one June 2008 hearing on the subject. Kucinich sat in the audience of the Judiciary committee as Democrats sped through a panel of anti-war witnesses and attorneys, and as Republicans asked why they were even there. ""The danger in proceeding with an impeachment without careful presentation of the facts is that you might put the country through even more turmoil,"" says Kucinich.  ""On the other hand, if facts are brought forward, public support would necessarily follow. But you can't assume public support. It really requires a very, very strenuous effort, while we're talking about an impeachment even before the facts of a hearing would be brought out. It's very dangerous to do that--you do so and it's not the president who gets impeached, it's the investigation itself."" Democrats hope as much; those of them who were around in 1998 and 2000 remember that the Clinton impeachment so damaged the Republican brand that George W. Bush had to run against his future allies in Congress. Clinton was weakened personally, and when it counted he wasn't as powerful a surrogate for Al Gore as he could have been. The Clintons have recovered rather well since then. ""Any talk of impeachment is irresponsible and foolish,"" says Ari Fleischer, Bush's first presidential press secretary. ""The committee's purpose should be to answer questions that remain unanswered. If any Republicans start talking about impeachment, they will only hurt themselves.""

16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/terry_mcauliffe_should_accept_the_medicaid_expansion_at_any_cost_the_republican.html	"Is Gov. Terry McAuliffe poised to blow up Virginia politics? It's a fair question given Friday's Washington Post story on the governor's potential attempt to expand the state's Medicaid program without legislative authorization. As the Post reports, ""McAuliffe and his top advisers have consulted lawyers, health-care experts and legislators on how to bypass the GOP-dominated House of Delegates,"" which refuses to adopt an expansion that would give health care to more than 400,000 low-income Virginians. Medicaid was the centerpiece of McAuliffe's campaign, and in his inauguration speech, he promised to press forward the policy, telling a rain-soaked Richmond crowd that he ""will work with the legislature to build on the Medicaid reforms that the General Assembly has already achieved, and to put Virginians' own tax dollars to work keeping families healthy and creating jobs here in the Commonwealth."" After three months of constant meetings with Republican lawmakers, this push to implement the expansion has slowed to a standstill. McAuliffe won't sign a budget without the change to Medicaid, and Republicans refuse to concede, citing cost (""it's too expensive""), skepticism (""the federal government won't cover its share""), and the political benefits of unified opposition--""This has been the No. 1 unifier,"" said one Republican activist. In other words, McAuliffe's willingness to lead means nothing when met with a rigid and hostile opposition. Now, it's worth noting the extent to which the Medicaid expansion is a remarkably good deal for state governments. Under the law, the federal government will pick up three years of full costs for any state that expands Medicaid to cover everyone below 133 percent of the federal poverty line ($15,521 for an individual or $31,721 for a family of four). After that, the federal subsidy gradually drops to 90 percent of the cost, with states responsible for the rest. A better deal than the current 50-50 split between states and the federal government for current Medicaid recipients. For some opponents of the expansion, that still isn't enough. Which is why it's good news that, according to new estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, the burden for states is lower than expected. On average, notes the CBO, the federal government covers more than 95 percent of the cost of the Medicaid expansion. Indeed, states that take the expansion will spend just 1.6 percent more on Medicaid than they would otherwise. In other words, it's not just a good deal, it's a great one. And at this point, there's no substantive reason not to take it. But, for Virginia Republicans, the substance is almost beside the point. To reject the Medicaid expansion is, for them, to strike a blow for conservative principles. More concretely, state Republicans believe they can capitalize on any government shutdown caused by their steadfast opposition, which relies on right-wing boilerplate like the idea that the federal government might renege on its promise of funding because it's ""broke."" It's this rigidity--and the looming shutdown--that has led McAuliffe to the unprecedented step of moving on his own. But unlike Govs. Steve Beshear of Kentucky or John Kasich of Ohio--who faced hostile legislatures in their drives to expand Medicaid--McAuliffe can't utilize a legal loophole or direct regulatory change. Here's the Post with more:"	Why Terry McAuliffe Should Expand Medicaid at All Costs
17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/wisconsin_s_voter_id_decision_judge_lynn_adelman_destroys_the_conservative.html	"Some precautions are necessary--wearing a helmet when you ride a bike, using a seatbelt when you're in a car--and others seem optional, like grabbing an umbrella on a cloudy day or wearing an apron when you make dinner. Others are dumb. You wouldn't get snow tires if you lived in Miami, and there's never a need for volcano insurance (unless you live in the shadow of Mount Etna, or something). You can add one more item to the list of useless precautions: voter identification laws. In an opinion striking down Wisconsin's voter ID law--signed in March by Gov. Scott Walker--Judge Lynn Adelman looks at the supposed menace of in-person voter fraud--the GOP's reason for ID requirements--and finds nothing. The state's argument is straightforward: The voter ID law will ""deter or prevent fraud by making it harder to impersonate a voter and cast a ballot in his or her name without detection."" To that end, it requires Wisconsin voters to produce an accepted, nonexpired form of state-issued ID to cast a ballot. If a voter lacks an ID, she can apply for one at the Wisconsin Department of Motor Vehicles, provided she has the right documents. And if she lacks a proper ID at the polls, she can cast a provisional ballot, and confirm her identity in-person on the Friday after the election. Opponents say this unfairly burdens older and low-income people, and minorities in particular. It's not that nonwhites can't get identification, but that they are most likely to face circumstances--poverty, geographic isolation, etc.--that make it hard to obtain one. Further, they argue, voter identification isn't necessary and harms more than it helps. It's for that reason that the plaintiffs--the League of United Latin American Citizens of Wisconsin--say the law is an unjustified burden on the right to vote. Judge Adelman agrees, and supports his stance with a treasure trove of evidence. Citing research on the incidence of in-person voter fraud in American elections, Adelman notes that, in eight years of Wisconsin elections--2004, 2008, 2010, and 2012--researchers could identify only ""one case of voter-impersonation fraud."" And in that case, it was a man who ""applied for and cast his recently deceased wife's absentee ballot."" Likewise, after ""comparing a database of deceased registered voters to a database of persons who had cast ballots in a recent election,"" in Georgia, another researcher found ""no evidence of ballots being illegally cast in the name of deceased voters."" Adelman even notes the sheer difficulty of committing in-person voter fraud, throwing water on the claim that this could ever be common. ""To commit voter-impersonation fraud,"" he says, ""a person would need to know the name of another person who is registered at a particular polling place, know the address of that person, know that the person has not yet voted, and also know that no one at the polls will realize that the impersonator is not the individual being impersonated."" He ends with a note that sounds like sarcasm, ""Given that a person would have to be insane to commit voter-impersonation fraud, [the law] cannot be deemed a reasonable response to a potential problem."" He also makes a key point about public perception: Insofar that anyone believes that in-person voter fraud is a problem, it's because elected officials--almost all of them Republican--treat it as such, as they push for these laws. Put simply, voter impersonation is a fake problem that doesn't need a solution. As for the burdens of voter identification? Adelman makes two important points. First, that a substantial number of registered Wisconsin voters--300,000, or 9 percent of the total--lack a qualifying ID. Of these voters, a substantial portion live at or below the poverty line. In practical terms, what this is means is that they lack the time or resources needed to get a valid ID. If you work a low-wage job, odds are good that you can't take time off to go to the DMV, and even if you could, you would need the cash to obtain the documents you need to prove your identity, like a birth certificate or a passport. It's at this point that, in my experience, voter ID proponents scoff at the idea that someone would lack these documents. But it's more common than you think. According to a 2006 survey from the Brennan Center for Justice, as many as 13 million Americans lack ready access to citizenship documents, which overlaps with the 21 million who lack photo identification. Moreover, millions have inconsistent documents--a passport that doesn't reflect their current name (a problem for many married women) or a photo ID that doesn't have their current address. Under the Wisconsin law, both groups would be barred from casting a normal ballot if they went to the polls. Adelman's second point elaborates on the burden. If you drive, you receive a daily benefit from the act of gathering one's documents and getting a license. If the voter ID requirement does anything, it offers the benefit of voting at ""no additional cost."" By contrast, he notes, a ""person whose daily life did not require possession of a photo ID prior to the imposition of the photo ID requirement is unlikely to derive any benefit"" from owning one. At most, they can keep voting. Or, put another way, they have to pay the same costs without the same benefits. It's unfair. By the end of Adelman's opinion, there are no pieces to pick up, and there is no legislative recourse for defenders of voter ID. Adelman ethered the rationale for voter identification, and struck down the law. Now, Republicans and Democrats will fight the upcoming elections on more even ground. This ruling is significant for more than what it means for Wisconsin. As Ari Berman notes for The Nation, it's part of a larger trend of courts striking down voter identification laws. In the last year, four other states--Arkansas, Pennsylvania, Missouri, and Texas--have had their requirements reversed by federal courts. What's more, the Wisconsin decision marks the first time a voter ID law has been invalidated under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, as opposed to a state constitution. In turn, this gives fuel to the Justice Department's present suits against voter ID laws in North Carolina and Texas--also filed under Section 2. The real question looking forward is whether Section 2 will survive. The Supreme Court has already destroyed the ""pre-clearance"" section of the Voting Rights Act, and conservatives are gunning for Section 2 in their drive to end race-conscious policymaking. If successful, they would end the government's ability to fight voting discrimination, and leave us with a country where states--like Wisconsin--are free to burden the fundamental rights of our most vulnerable citizens."	Why Wisconsin's Voter ID Decision Is a Very Big Deal

For months upon months, Pat McCrory avoided admitting what was obvious--that he wanted Thom Tillis, the speaker of the state House of Representatives, to be the Republican nominee for Senate. During those months, Tillis struggled to put distance between himself and two other candidates--a doctor endorsed by Rand Paul and a pastor endorsed by Mike Huckabee. McCrory stayed out of it. ""Tillis has the best chance to win the general election,"" McCrory told one interviewer, citing polls but no ground truth. That changed on Tuesday, one week before polls would close in the primary. At 9:55 a.m., North Carolina's Public Policy Polling released a survey that showed Tillis easily winning the race and avoiding a runoff. Ten minutes later, McCrory strolled into a local sheet metal design company, admired a red metal TILLIS sign that hung near a podium, and announced his ""plan to vote on the ballot for Thom Tillis."" The candidate, a 53-year-old with closed-cropped hair and narrow eyes, beamed as the governor gave him credit for everything that had happened since Republicans won total control of the state. ""No longer is North Carolina the fifth-highest in unemployment in the country,"" said McCrory, who led the party's 2012 sweep. ""Now it's not even in the top 30 ... there's no doubt in my mind that Thom Tillis has risen to the top in this interview process."" North Carolina has become an abattoir for easy political narratives. Last summer, as McCrory and Tillis approved decades of pent-up right-wing legislation--voter ID, tax cuts, legal fracking, limits on legal abortion--Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan led Tillis by as much as 15 points. McCrory's own approval rating has yet to recover, and progressives have never stopped organizing ""Moral Monday"" protests of the legislature. Just two weeks ago, the New York Times profiled Tillis' race as a microcosm of the GOP's ""civil war."" But all of a sudden, Tillis has become a senator-in-waiting, the best example of how the Republican Party's drive to the right has robbed space from Tea Party challengers. Americans for Prosperity has blanketed the state with ""educational"" ads intended to make this easier for him, as has American Crossroads. Tillis won them over by keeping North Carolina out of the Affordable Care Act's exchanges and Medicaid expansion. In doing so he may end the short political career of Dr. Greg Brannon, the Rand Paul candidate, and the sort of Republican who won these sorts of elections until the rest of the party figured out how to discredit them. Brannon had never run for an office besides this one. He was once another conservative driven to distraction, then passion, early in the reign of President Obama. ""I was on a run at the beach,"" he told reporter Paul Specht. ""I just felt God lay on my heart: November '14, Hagan's seat."" By mid-2009 he'd founded a Tea Party blog and was speaking at rallies, and by 2013 he was putting together a campaign team that included veterans of Sen. Ted Cruz's Texas win and young people trained in Ron Paul's Campaign for Liberty boot camps. ""This guy's amazing,"" said Utah Sen. Mike Lee while stumping for Brannon this year. ""This man quotes the Constitution more, with greater fluidity, with greater degree of comfort and familiarity than perhaps any other candidate I've ever met. The only one who comes close is named Ted Cruz."" That might have been unfair to Brannon, who never heard a question that couldn't be answered with a constitutional citation. When Hagan suggested that the 2013 versions of gun control legislation were worth debating, Brannon called that ""democracy, which is actually socialism, which is called majority rule."" When musing about how frequently America mobilized troops without a congressional declaration of war, he suggested ""we'd be much better if we had a militia of North Carolina, a militia of Maryland, exactly the way the Constitution stated."" That was how Brannon talked all the time, in most interviews and every debate, and especially in the April 28 public television debate that closed out the campaign. Each candidate was given a little red card with the word ""rebuttal"" on it, to be waved whenever he was lied about. Brannon never used it--he turned every question back to the section of the Constitution that invalidated it, then flashed a quick smile at his son in the audience. Was the Affordable Care Act legal? ""The Supreme Court has no power to enforce their opinion. This goes back to state sovereignty."" How could America make Russia irrelevant? ""In Article IV of the Constitution, the federal government makes money by selling its territories and land. Sell back parts of the western states again."" Brannon dazzled his opponents with obscure references. He alone pointed out that America had not officially declared war since the beginning of conflict with Romania during World War II, and he alone asked the audience to read a foreign policy tract written by Sen. Robert Taft during his primary with Dwight Eisenhower. (A sample line: ""The brazen disregard of law in the Korean enterprise and in the setting up of an international army in Europe is further evidence that our State Department has long since repudiated any serious respect for law and justice."") Tillis could hardly compete, but neither wanted nor needed to. On his side: a metahuman command of talking points. At the final debate, as in every debate, he packed at least two digs at Hagan into every answer. Hagan and Obama were, he said, ""destroying America."" When asked how he'd replace Obamacare, he promised he ""wouldn't follow Kay Hagan's failure of Obamacare, which put 2.5 million people out of work."" Monday night's moderator did not challenge the ""2.5 million"" line, which wasn't really true at all. But neither did the other candidates, who sprained their joints trying to find the space to Tillis' right. The best Mark Harris, the pastor-turned-candidate, could do was shame Tillis for saying that the state's 2012 gay marriage ban--put on the ballot after Tillis marshaled it through the House--would be repealed in 20 years. ""What I said was a warning,"" Tillis told reporters after the debate. ""It wasn't a prediction."" The best Brannon could do, apart from demonstrating his superior knowledge of what happened in 1787, was cite a radio ad (paid for by the Democrats) in which Tillis called the Affordable Care Act ""a great idea that can't be paid for."" Hagan's point: Hey, even Tillis didn't disagree with the goals of the law. ""It doesn't sound like Kay Hagan or Greg Brannon get my sarcasm,"" Tillis told me. There was really no way to tell. After Monday's debate, Tillis and Harris hung around to talk to reporters. The next day, Tillis went on a two-day public tour with the Chamber of Commerce, and a call to Harris' campaign found a volunteer happy to say where the candidate was heading next. Brannon was not so easy to reach. When the debate ended, he retreated to a green room with his aides, huddling for about 20 minutes before darting back to his hospital. His spokesman apologized to reporters and collected phone numbers where the candidate could call them. The calls never came. The next morning, calls and texts to the spokesman went to voicemail and--eventually--bounced off a full mailbox. While they did, Tillis was replacing McCrory at the podium, under the steel sign, saying everything he needed to say. Hagan had voted ""96 percent of the time with President Obama,"" which meant she wasn't what North Carolina deserved--""a senator that believes in America, that believes in American exceptionalism."" Sure, there were protests of the Republican legislature. Check the record, check the unemployment number: The protesters were wrong. ""Our conservative revolution--the liberals hated it, the conservatives loved it."" So the press returned to McCrory: Why, as the leader of the party, did he weigh in on this race and stop pretending he was neutral? ""I was being asked by a lot of people,"" he said. ""That's the kind of leader I am--I tell people where I stand on an issue."" Another reporter asked if McCrory had alienated the Tea Party--he blew the question off with a well-scripted attack on Hagan. The scrum broke up, and McCrory took a few questions about how the state was preparing for a hurricane, until another reporter asked if the primary was still splitting the party. ""I think I've answered that question,"" said McCrory. In word and deed, he had."	How the GOP's Establishment Candidate in North Carolina Won by Running Right
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/george_washington_s_225th_inaugural_anniversary_why_presidents_have_felt.html	"Two hundred and twenty-five years ago Wednesday, George Washington put his hand on a Masonic Bible and became the first person to recite the presidential oath of office. It may have been the whiniest inauguration in history. Washington told anyone who would listen that he was unfit for the job. He constantly fretted about it. He wrote that waiting for official word of his selection was like waiting for his hanging. ""I wish there may not be reason for regretting the choice,"" he said upon being informed of the official decision. During his ride to the inauguration in New York, he confessed his fears at every stop. In the first line of the first inaugural address he said, ""No event could have filled me with greater anxieties."" Presidents have often complained that the White House is like a prison. ""Being president is like being a jackass in a hailstorm,"" said Lyndon Johnson. ""There's nothing to do but stand there and take it."" This might seem like a modern phenomenon--the product of constant media scrutiny, the permanent Secret Service bubble, and the relentless partisan sniping. But the bars were there long before the White House was even built. George Washington behaved like he was walking into a presidential penitentiary. Presidents are expected to perform miracles but lack the instruments to achieve them. Harry Truman wrote in his diary about the ""great white jail"" where the disconnect between what the people want and what the Constitution allows a president to deliver was so strong it caused the ghosts of his predecessors to roam the halls: ""The tortured souls who were and are misrepresented in history are the ones who come back."" The modern president is expected to act. Washington's task was to fight against being pulled into action by countrymen who wanted to make him king. ""I greatly apprehend that my countrymen will expect too much from me,"" he wrote, worrying that the extravagant ""undue praises which they are heaping upon me at this moment"" would quickly turn to equally extravagant ""censures."" He faced more than high expectations, though. He faced the other aspect of presidential confinement: the acute feeling of impotence. His long and winding trip from Mount Vernon to his April 30, 1789, inauguration in New York was a prolonged demonstration of how difficult it would be to work his will in office. He asked his countrymen not to make a fuss over his inauguration and they repeatedly, resolutely, and resoundingly ignored him. Washington's reluctance to serve is legendary. It was a mixture of healthy modesty and genuine fear that at 57 he was not up to the task. But it was also a public relations ploy. Washington showed reluctance in the hope that his countrymen would not think he had taken the job to enrich himself or that anyone should want such a post for that reason. Historian Joseph Ellis in His Excellency: George Washington quotes one thrilled supporter telling the new president, ""You are now a king, under a different name."" That was the last thing he wanted to hear. A republic couldn't be led by a king. Some in Congress had tried to load Washington with the title ""His Highness the President of the United States of America and the Protector of Their Liberties,"" but he slapped it away. He would be called Mr. President. But the people didn't care what Washington wanted. As Ron Chernow writes in colorful detail in Washington: A Life, his trek north became a comic tale of new ways his countrymen found to thwart his desire for a low-key promotion. Washington set out from Mount Vernon on April 16, writing in his diary that his ""mind oppressed with more anxious and painful sensations than I have words to express."" He was in a hurry to get to New York so that he could start working, hoping to make the trip in ""as quiet and peaceable manner as possible."" He wrote to the governor of New York asking to be put up in public lodgings, so it wouldn't look like he was taxing any private individual and pleaded for no hoopla: ""No reception can be so congenial to my feelings as a quiet entry devoid of ceremony."" In Alexandria, Virginia, at the start of his journey, hundreds of men, women, and children greeted him in the streets. (Traffic has been hell in Alexandria ever since.) At his dinner that night, he had to endure 13 toasts. In Baltimore and Delaware, the streets were also lined. Newspapers had printed his travel route. Veterans appeared in their uniforms. Songs were sung to celebrate his life. As he approached Philadelphia, 20,000 people filled the streets, some yelling ""Long live George Washington,"" which sounded very much like the phrase the English used to greet their monarchs. City fathers asked Washington to dismount and ride a white horse through town. While crossing a bridge wreathed in laurels and evergreens, a cherubic boy was lowered so that he could place a laurel crown on the president-elect's head. (Ellis writes that the wreath was actually lowered by the daughter of Charles Willson Peale, the famous painter and Washington portraitist.) Anyone who has had to feign gratitude at a gaudy birthday gift can relate to Washington's predicament. He was being forced to wear the itchy sweater for a week, smiling as if he liked it. After spending the night in Philadelphia, he couldn't hack it anymore. He left early to avoid the departure ceremony. But that only made him early for the rose petals in Trenton, New Jersey. A floral arch erected in his honor read ""December 26, 1776,"" the date of his famous victory at that spot. It also read ""The Defender of the Mothers will also Defend the Daughters."" To make sure Washington didn't miss the point, 13 young girls dressed in white walked before him spreading flowers. The trip ended with a barge ride into New York, manned by 13 oarsmen, also dressed in virginal white. A flotilla accompanied him, including other barges, where musicians played and hymns were sung. The city streets were filled, flags waved, and cannons fired. So much for the ""quiet entry devoid of ceremony."" After spending a week in New York making preparations for the inauguration, Washington ditched his initial 73-page speech, which included a long justification explaining that he had not taken the job for personal gain. Instead, he gave an intentionally enigmatic address, fearful that each line might set a precedent. It wasn't a commanding performance. ""This great man was agitated and embarrassed more than ever he was by the leveled cannon or pointed musket,"" wrote Pennsylvania Sen. William Maclay in his diary. One precedent had been set, though. Presidents have been unsuccessfully battling the expectations of their countrymen ever since."	George Washington Wanted a Simple Inauguration 225 Years Ago. No One Listened.

He has nothing but disdain for African-Americans, telling his girlfriend--herself black and Mexican--that it ""bothers"" him ""a lot"" that she wants to ""broadcast"" she's ""associating with black people"" and that she shouldn't ""bring them to [his] games,"" despite the fact his games are played by black people. Naturally, this tirade has sparked a wave of justified anger and protest, as well as condemnation from the NBA's biggest stars. ""It's a shame that Donald Sterling feels that way about African-Americans,"" said Magic Johnson, who Sterling name-checked as a black person not to bring to his games. Shaquille O'Neal called the audio ""repugnant,"" and in a statement, Michael Jordan--who mostly shies away from controversy--said, ""There is no room in the NBA--or anywhere else--for the kind of racism and hatred that Mr. Sterling allegedly expressed."" He's right. In a league dominated by black athletes, there is zero room for Sterling's brand of booming bigotry. It's a good thing for Sterling that his worst offenses were quiet and concrete: the kinds of actions that harm people in their daily lives but stay under the radar. What's striking about Sterling's rant and its hours of coverage is the extent to which it isn't new. To wit, in 2003, 19 plaintiffs sued Sterling for housing discrimination. In the suit, Sterling is accused of telling his staff that he did not like blacks and Hispanics, citing their behavior. ""Hispanics smoke, drink, and just hang around the building,"" he allegedly said. What's more, the lawsuit said, Sterling told his staff that he only wanted to rent his apartments to Koreans and forced black tenants to sign in when they entered the building. ""Is she one of those black people that stink?"" he allegedly asked of an elderly black tenant who needed repairs to her apartment. ""I am not going to do that. Just evict the bitch."" His wife, Rochelle Sterling, also participated, posing as a health inspector to harass tenants and record their ethnicities. Donald Sterling settled for an undisclosed sum in 2005--paying $5 million in plaintiff legal fees--but faced renewed scrutiny in 2006, following federal civil rights charges. According to the Justice Department, Sterling, his wife, and his three companies engaged in housing discrimination by refusing to rent to blacks and ""creating, maintaining, and perpetuating an environment that is hostile to non-Korean tenants"" at their properties. Again, Sterling settled. He paid $2.65 million to a fund for people harmed by his discriminatory practices--a record sum in a federal housing suit--as well as $100,000 to the government. These were huge offenses--entrenchments of disadvantage in a city segmented by past bias. After all, Los Angeles was heavily redlined throughout the 20th century, with blacks, Mexicans, Chinese, and other minorities blocked from mortgage loans and relegated to the least desirable parts of the city. But, despite the magnitude of the offenses and the size of the settlements, there was no outrage. Sterling caused actual harm to dozens of families, and the response was near silence. And it's in that contrast that we can clearly see our public hypocrisy on racism. When it comes to open bigotry, everyone is an anti-racist. The same Republicans who question the Civil Rights Act and oppose race-conscious policy are on the front lines when it's time to denounce the outlandish racism of the day. ""I wholeheartedly disagree with him,"" said Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul in response to Cliven Bundy's digression on ""the Negro."" Sean Hannity, the Fox News personality who championed Bundy's cause of free grazing rights, blasted Bundy for his ""ignorant, racist, repugnant, despicable"" comments. Indeed, the mere hint of racial insensitivity is enough to bring the hammer down, as we rush to refute and repudiate the transgressor. This can go too far--see the most recent controversy over Donald Rumsfeld--but it's an understandable impulse, and on the whole, a good one. At the same time, we all but ignore the other dimension of racism--the policies and procedures that sustain our system of racial inequality. The outrage that comes when a state representative says something stupid about professional basketball players is absent when we learn that black children are punished at dramatically higher rates than their white peers, even as preschoolers. Likewise, it's absent when we learn that banks targeted minorities--regardless of income--for the worst possible mortgage loans, destroying their wealth in the process. In turn, this blinds us to the racial implications of actions that seem colorblind. In a world where racism looks like cartoonish bigotry, it's hard to build broad outrage for unfair voter identification laws or huge disparities in health care access. In fairness, some of this comes from caution. Do we want to denounce Sterling for housing discrimination if we don't know the full story? Is it fair to decry his racism if we don't have the facts? What's more, we risk implicating ourselves by taking a broader view of racism. If I condemn Sterling for refusing federal vouchers, do I indict myself for opposing low-income developments in my neighborhood? When it comes to adjudicating bias, racist words are easier to condemn--and a little less thorny--than actions. But this shouldn't be our concern in the first place. For as much as it satisfies to condemn racism in the public sphere, it's also a distraction. Donald Sterling's personal disdain for black Americans is less important than his racist property management, in the same way that Lyndon Johnson's prejudice--he said the word nigger, a lot--is less important than his civil rights record. That's not to discount the experience of hatred--it's painful to hear and worse to experience. But when it comes to bigotry as a public issue, what you do is more important than what you say. A world where Donald Sterling hates black people but rents to them at fair prices is better than one where he loves them, but still discriminates. Read more about Clippers owner Donald Sterling."	We Should Be More Outraged Over What Donald Sterling Does, Not What He Says
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/david_frum_conor_friedersdorf_and_class_based_affirmative_action_why_race.html	"Late last year, in a speech on economic mobility, President Obama dismissed the idea that income inequality was an ""exclusively minority concern."" ""The opportunity gap,"" he said, is ""now as much about class as it is about race,"" adding that ""we have to reject a politics that suggests any effort to address it in a meaningful way somehow pits the interests of a deserving middle class against those of an undeserving poor in search of handouts."" For many of Obama's liberal supporters, this sounded right. Given the growing diversity of the United States, class is the most relevant concern, and we need policies that explicitly address class disadvantage. Class is important, but it's also not enough. As a bevy of sociologists have shown in recent years, it's almost impossible to disentangle inequality from racism. Neighborhood conditions for black children, to use one example, are far worse than those for white ones, even after you adjust for income. Just 10 percent of black millennials have grown up in a neighborhood with poverty rates below 10 percent. The large majority of black children, regardless of income, grow up around a level of poverty unfamiliar to most whites, including those on the lowest rungs. What's more, few blacks grow up in families with a modest or substantial amount of wealth. According to a 2012 study from the Pew Economic Mobility Project, just 15 percent of blacks start in the top three quintiles of wealth, and just 17 percent in the top three of income. The vast majority of blacks begin their lives at the bottom of the economic ladder, and few make it any further. To ignore this racial dimension of disadvantage--and the extent to which it shapes class lines and extends across them--is to entrench it. Unfortunately, in their arguments against race-based affirmative action, neither David Frum nor Conor Friedersdorf (both of the Atlantic) seems to countenance that fact. In fairness, Friedersdorf spends more time on diversity and what it means for racial preferences in admissions. Affirmative action, he argues, doesn't reflect the diversity of today's America where some minorities--Asians in particular--are potentially disadvantaged by existing racial preferences. As he writes, ""[Justice Sonia Sotomayor] just disappeared Asians from her lengthy discussion of race and minority groups."" Indeed, it's possible that in a highly diverse and cosmopolitan America, minority-group interests will diverge, as people disagree. Still, it's possible that a more diverse America is also one where blacks and certain Latinos (most likely the low-income and the undocumented) continue to occupy the bottom of the racial hierarchy, segregated in poor neighborhoods with bad schools and substandard services. In which case, race-based affirmative action may stand as a necessary remedy to this particular form of inequality, at least when it comes to college admissions. However, Friedersdorf thinks we should turn our attention to class. ""Wouldn't it be easier,"" he writes, ""to end legacy admissions, pressure colleges to subsidize test prep, and give all poor kids a boost when they apply to state universities?"" Frum does the same. Like his colleague, Frum cites the browning of America as one reason to re-evaluate the commitment to racial preferences. ""As intermarriage between ethnic groups accelerates--one in six Americans now marries a person outside his or her own race or ethnicity--the task of adjudicating these preferences becomes ever more baroque and absurd,"" he writes. From there, however, he highlights class as the division that matters most: ""A white skin may still correlate less with poverty than does a darker skin. But that skin alone long ago ceased to convey much in the way of privilege to the less affluent half of white America."" He continues, ""In 21st-century America, class trumps race."" But this is untrue. Blacks and whites (and to a lesser extent, Latinos) of similar economic status live in dramatically different environments. The persistence of residential segregation yields a world where the vast majority of blacks (including those in the middle-class) live in areas with higher crime rates, worse schools, and lower property values than their white counterparts. As sociologist Patrick Sharkey puts it, ""blacks and whites inhabit such different neighborhoods that it is not possible to compare the economic outcomes of black and white children who grow up in similarly disadvantaged neighborhoods."" The same goes for low-income Asian-Americans, who just don't experience this level of concentrated poverty. Consider class alone, and you'll miss this entirely. It's why, as Nikole Hannah-Jones reported for ProPublica last year, ""many scholars say race remains so powerful a factor that a class-based system would seriously reduce black and Latino representation at American colleges from their current levels."" None of this is to say that we shouldn't have class-based affirmative action. Talented students with impoverished backgrounds deserve a leg up in the admissions lottery. But we must understand that we still live in a world of intense racial inequality, where racism blends with inequality to produce unique problems for blacks and Latinos at all income levels. Frum writes, ""If you are in a position in which affirmative action is relevant to your prospects, you have already risen above the worst that American society metes to its disadvantaged."" Maybe. A black student with two professional parents may have material resources, but she still faces racial obstacles in a way that isn't true of any of her white peers. And odds are good that--depending on her neighborhood--she had worse schools and fewer opportunities along the way. Racial preferences in education don't solve the myriad problems faced by low-income blacks and other groups. But it doesn't make sense to fault a targeted program for its narrow scope. If we want to deal with economic diversity in admissions, we should adopt class-based affirmative action. And if we want to deal with inequality writ large, well, there's an agenda for that too."	Why Class-Based Affirmative Action Won't Heal Our Racial Disparities
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/house_members_who_work_for_wall_street_center_for_public_integrity_investigation.html	"The lawmakers were at an impasse. More than two hours into a meeting of the House Financial Services Committee last month, the members were bickering over two versions of a bill designed to ease a new regulation that affected banks, part of the sweeping 2010 overhaul of financial laws known as the Dodd-Frank Act. The dispute? Whether to give the banks everything they asked for, or whether to give them even more. Rep. Scott Garrett, a Republican from New Jersey, asked to postpone a final vote so he could contact ""stakeholders,"" code for the bankers who wanted the change. Then Texas Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling, the committee's ambitious chairman, attempted to retake the discussion with what passes for a joke in the wood-paneled hearing room in the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill. ""Occasionally we have been accused of trying to undermine aspects of Dodd-Frank,"" Hensarling said with a chuckle. ""I hope we're guilty of it."" Hensarling was being modest. With a 29-person committee staff, dozens of congressional colleagues, and legions of lobbyists lined up to beat back any attempt to impose new discipline on the industry, the 56-year-old from Dallas is well on his way to achieving that goal. Bankers' best friends Every business sector has its friends in Washington. Financial companies--from the biggest megabanks to small payday lenders--have some of the best. Less than six years after a massive financial crisis drove the U.S. banking system to the edge of collapse, leading to a $700 billion government bailout and a recession that destroyed as much as $34 trillion in wealth, bankers and lawmakers are working in concert to undermine Dodd-Frank, an 849-page law designed to prevent another failure. There are more than 2,000 lobbyists for financial firms and trade groups, and many are spreading money around Washington, enlisting like-minded members of Congress to write letters, propose legislation, hold hearings, and threaten agency budgets as they pressure regulators to ease up on banks. Regulators say they try to treat input from lawmakers like that from anyone else. However, ""there are all these other factors, like the budget, like the fact that they can call you up to testify, and they can make your life pretty miserable,"" said the former head of one regulatory agency who asked not to be identified, as did many of those contacted for this story. The campaign is working. While Hensarling's committee can't move legislation on its own--the Senate Banking Committee supports Dodd-Frank--the House panel can work its will in other ways. And it has. Almost four years after Dodd-Frank became law, community banks face lower capital standards than originally proposed and are therefore more likely to fail; fewer derivatives traders have to register with regulators, and they face lower hurdles in booking trades than they otherwise would have, partly undermining the law's aim to make this corner of the financial system more transparent; and big banks may soon have a green light to keep investing in potentially risky securities that regulators tried to limit. In the current election cycle, employees and political action committees of financial companies have donated nearly $149 million to congressional candidates, more than any other industry, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. That's more than two-and-a-half times the $57 million donated by the health care sector, the second most generous industry. ""It's an exceedingly rich industry with a lot at stake,"" said Brad Miller, a member of the House financial committee from 2003 to 2013 and currently a lawyer with the firm Grais & Ellsworth. With lawmakers under constant pressure to raise money, Miller said, deep-pocketed lobbyists ""don't have to worry about having access to members, because all you have to do is wait for the phone to ring--and you don't have to wait very long."" The banking caucus The Center for Public Integrity reviewed political finance records, members' voting records, public statements, and correspondence between Congress and financial regulators to identify the House's unofficial banking caucus--the financial industry's go-to lawmakers on the Financial Services Committee. In addition to Hensarling and Garrett, the banking caucus includes Reps. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Sean Duffy of Wisconsin, Jim Himes of Connecticut, Blaine Luetkemeyer of Missouri, Gregory Meeks of New York, Ed Royce of California, David Scott of Georgia, Steve Stivers of Ohio, and Ann Wagner of Missouri. The center of this alliance is Hensarling, a sharp-tongued Texan who learned his trade as a staffer for former Sen. Phil Gramm. Hensarling has thick gray-brown hair and eyes that slant down at the corners, giving the impression that he's on the verge of breaking into a boyish smile. Because of his ties to the House leadership, Hensarling leapfrogged senior members to become committee chair last year when Rep. Spencer Bachus stepped down because of term limits set by House Republicans. Operating with a strict, top-down style, Hensarling's staff, with the help of lobbyists, orchestrates hearings and decides which proposals by regulators merit a letter from Congress and who should sign that letter, according to former committee staffers who have worked with him. One subcommittee, for example, has spent months crafting a broad ""indictment"" of the Dodd-Frank Act. The chair of another drafted a letter to regulators and sent it directly to the American Bankers Association so the industry group could pressure other lawmakers to sign on. Several members of the banking caucus have close ties to the financial industry predating their arrival in Congress, making them especially reliable in corralling cosponsors for a bill or signatures for a letter to regulators. Stivers, for instance, was the top lobbyist until 2002 for Bank One, where Jamie Dimon became CEO in 2000. (JPMorgan Chase & Co. bought BankOne in 2004 and made Dimon president; he became CEO of the world's biggest bank a year later.) Luetkemeyer's family owns a community bank. He has a decades-old relationship with Camden Fine, the top lobbyist for small banks, and is sponsoring a package of rule changes sought by Fine's organization. ""Luetkemeyer is positioned and ready to fight for our industry,"" a magazine published by the Independent Community Bankers of America proclaimed in 2011. Capito, who chairs the subcommittee that oversees consumer lending and finance companies, is married to a banker who has worked for Wells Fargo and Citigroup. Himes spent 12 years at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. before joining a nonprofit housing group in 2002. He represents the tony New York City suburb of Greenwich, Conn., which is home to some of the world's largest hedge funds. Others align with single industries. Royce, for example, has developed a near-symbiotic relationship with the credit union industry in the 21 years since he took office. He has raised more than twice as much from credit unions as any other lawmaker and has sponsored at least 11 bills seeking to relax rules that frustrate the industry. Several sought to loosen limits on commercial lending by credit unions, a fight he pledged to continue in a Feb. 25 speech before 4,400 credit union employees and advocates at the Credit Union National Association's annual conference in Washington. He filed the latest version of the bill on March 13. And several former staffers with ties to Hensarling or the committee are now working directly for the financial industry. Just as Hensarling rose to become committee chair, his chief of staff of eight years, Dee Buchanan, decamped to Ogilvy Government Relations where he lobbies for the American Bankers Association, insurers, and a private equity firm. Former committee chief of staff Larry Lavender now lobbies at the firm Jones Walker for JPMorgan Chase & Co. and payday lending giant Cash America International. Fundraising platform The financial services committee is a crucial fundraising tool for both parties because companies with interests in its work generally have money to spend. In the mid-1990s, leaders began packing the panel to help their members bring in campaign cash, and membership swelled from 50 members in 1995 to 71 in 2009. Membership has since been trimmed to 61, but it's still second in size only to the Armed Services Committee, which has 62 members. Panel members raise more money for their election campaigns, on average, than those on any other House panel. In the two years that ended in 2012, members raised an average of $2.6 million, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, edging out the powerful Ways and Means Committee. ""Members are encouraged by both Democrats and Republicans to spend every waking moment being on the phone asking for money, and the people you ask for money if you're on the Financial Services Committee are lobbyists for financial interests,"" said Miller, the former member. Hensarling's fundraising nearly doubled in 2012, after he became the highest-ranking Republican on the committee. He hosted a fundraising ski trip in February at the St. Regis Deer Valley resort in Park City, Utah, that boasts uniformed ""ski valets,"" a ""private ski beach,"" and a ""split-level infinity pool."" His political action committee, the Jobs, Economy and Budget Fund, took in $87,100 that month, including $5,000 each from the Consumer Bankers Association, the Capital One Financial PAC, and the National Pawnbrokers Association PAC. Financial interests recently hosted Scott at Johnny's Half Shell and Himes at Sonoma, both Capitol Hill dining spots, according to copies of the invitations posted by the Sunlight Foundation. Meeks enjoys fundraising trips to Las Vegas and throws an annual Super Bowl party for big-ticket donors, according to the New York Post. The Sunlight Foundation database includes invitations to fundraisers held on behalf of Garrett, Luetkemeyer, Meeks, and Scott at the townhouse of Tim Rupli, a well-known lobbyist whose clients have included payday lenders and prepaid debit card companies. Himes' spokeswoman, Elizabeth Kerr, said her boss is not advocating for the investment industry. ""The congressman doesn't advocate for or against an industry. He advocates for the right law or regulation,"" she said. The financial sector spent $484.7 million in 2013 lobbying Congress, according to CRP. That includes about $3.6 million spent by groups representing consumer interests. Financial industry lobbyists outnumber those for consumer groups by at least 20 to 1, according to a report by The Nation. ""I used to have 100 meetings with people from the financial sector to every three or four from consumer groups,"" said Bart Chilton, who until last month was a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates derivatives. When Congress and trade groups work together, the united front can overwhelm regulators, who depend on Congress for budget approval and can face embarrassing public excoriation if they defy lawmakers, according to a senior staffer for a financial regulator who has spent years working with Congress. How it works It was late on a Thursday afternoon in December when Cam Fine opened an email and saw the message: ""We may have a problem with Volcker."" Fine is the powerful top lobbyist for community banks, and his regulation experts were warning him about an unexpected threat from the Volcker rule, a provision of Dodd-Frank designed to prevent banks from investing, and risking, money for their own profit. The rule was aimed squarely at banking giants engaged in so-called proprietary trading, the practice of buying and selling of securities for their own profit, unrelated to client business. To Fine's surprise, the Volcker rule laid out by regulators was about to roil his little-bank world. ""We were, like, gobsmacked!"" he said. The proposed rule would require community banks to get rid of investments known as trust-preferred collateralized debt obligations. The issue was a technical one, but it would slash the profits of hundreds of community banks and threaten the very survival of a handful. Fine went to work. He called his bankers, he called the regulators, he called his counterparts at other banking trade groups, he said. The community banking lobby, by many accounts, is the most powerful in the industry. What the banks lack in size, they make up for in numbers--more than 6,000, at least one in each congressional district. Fine keeps a map on his office wall showing each of his members in every congressional district, a reminder that he can activate locally influential bankers to further his group's message with any congressional office. Fine and his member bankers started calling up their friends on Capitol Hill, including Capito and Hensarling, who have raised more money from commercial banks than any other House member, including House Speaker John Boehner. After talking to the bankers and lobbyists, Capito and Hensarling fired off a letter telling a slew of regulators that the rule was supposed to ""limit certain activities at large, complex financial institutions,"" yet this provision would harm ""Main Street financial institutions ... critical to our economic recovery."" They followed up three weeks later with a proposed legislative change dubbed the ""Fairness for Community Job Creators Act."" The five regulatory agencies involved in the rule fell in line. The Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., CFTC, Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency all agreed to allow community banks to keep their CDOs. They made the announcement before Jan. 15, when most banks would have to report their quarterly profits. Going for more Community banks got their fix, as often happens, but lobbyists for the American Bankers Association, which represents the broader banking industry, are still seeking to blunt Volcker's potential effect on big banks. Lawmakers know their constituents think they're on the side of the angels when they help community banks. Letting them keep their CDOs was a political win-win. Now the bigger banks wanted a similar carve-out for another kind of investment: so-called collateralized loan obligations, bundles of junk-rated corporate loans that were the subject of competing legislation at last month's committee meeting. Under Volcker, CLOs--which performed well during the financial crisis--fell into the same category as the mortgage-backed securities and CDOs that roiled the industry after the housing market collapsed. Banks would have to sell off the full range of investments. As a result, the CLO market nearly froze. Issuance of new CLOs, according to research firm S&P Capital IQ, fell to $2.55 billion in January from $7.05 billion in December, when the Volcker rule was published. To get what they want, bank lobbyists and lawmakers are resorting, critics charge, to an old rhetorical trick: ""They are trying to hide behind community banks, grossly exaggerating if not lying about the facts and claiming the need for a big loophole,"" said Dennis Kelleher, CEO of Better Markets, a group that advocates stronger market oversight. Yet the biggest holder of CLOs is JP Morgan, the biggest bank of all, which owns 41 percent of the $70 billion of CLOs held by banks, according to data compiled by Better Markets from the companies' financial filings. Only 21 of the 6,000 community banks in the U.S. own CLOs, according to the Loan Syndication and Trading Association, a trade group. The SEC is investigating whether banks are using CLOs to unlawfully shift assets off their balance sheets, according to the Wall Street Journal. Rep. Scott of Georgia, at a February Financial Services Committee hearing, urged regulators from five agencies to rethink the treatment of CLOs, saying the securities ""provide large amounts of credit to small businesses."" ""They are not toxic. They didn't cause the problem,"" Scott continued, adding that small and regional community banks would be hurt. A senior official with one of the regulators, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak on the topic, said that Scott's remarks were taken almost word-for-word from a list of suggested questions written by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and passed around to members of the committee. SIFMA--which represents huge investment firms such as Morgan Stanley and Fidelity and spent more than $5.2 million last year on lobbying--declined to comment. Scott's chief of staff, Michael Andel, didn't confirm or deny the allegation. ""I can't find anything to match up to this,"" he said. None of the other elected officials in this story responded to requests for interviews or comments. Scott's behavior isn't uncommon, said Miller, who also is a fellow with the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank. Elected officials ""are very willing to repeat verbatim what lobbyists suggest they say."" The Financial Services Committee eventually approved a bill tweaking Volcker to allow banks to keep investing in most CLOs. While that bill is unlikely to become law, Federal Reserve Gov. Daniel Tarullo on Feb. 5 assured the committee that the CLO issue ""is already at the top of the list"" of items regulators were planning to address. Issuance surged back. In March, $10.8 billion in CLOs hit the market. In April, the Fed said it would give banks an additional two years to comply with the new rules. ""All too often, those in government respond to the squeaky wheel, and they try to address things that maybe ought not to be addressed,"" said Chilton, the former regulator. ""You can get a letter done"" Lawmakers often write letters to agencies to amplify banks' messages and exert pressure on regulators. A Freedom of Information Act request yielded 1,820 pages of correspondence between lawmakers and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a new agency created by the Dodd-Frank law and despised by financial institutions, from October 2010 through December 2013. Similar requests yielded hundreds of letters to the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The CFTC and the SEC post their letters online. The Treasury Department did not fulfill a FOIA request in time for publication. ""You can't get legislation done, but you can get a letter done,"" said a longtime financial lobbyist who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was afraid of retaliation by Hensarling's staff. ""Any time you can deliver the message, it's just one more tile in the mosaic."" New Jersey's Garrett wrote or signed on to dozens of letters to regulators objecting to proposed Dodd-Frank rules, advocating for changes and most commonly demanding that the agencies perform exhaustive cost-benefit analyses of every new provision. In August 2011, he wrote Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and five other agencies urging them to eliminate a proposed rule that would delay or cut the profits large banks can earn when they securitize bundles of mortgage loans. The letters served to amplify the messages regulators were receiving from JP Morgan, Bank of America, the American Bankers Association, and dozens of others asking them to eliminate the so-called premium capture cash reserve accounts, or PCCRAs. The accounts were part of a proposed mortgage finance regulation to ensure that lenders hold on their books 5 percent of all the risky loans they write. Regulators believed the accounts could prevent banks from manipulating loan terms to make it look like they were holding a 5 percent stake when in fact the stake was lower, said Guy Cecala, the CEO of Inside Mortgage Finance, a newsletter that tracks the industry. The rule would have affected only a small segment of the mortgage market, loans that don't meet the safest underwriting requirements. ""It happens to be a segment of the market that everyone wants to bring back,"" Cecala said. ""Nobody as a regulator wants to take the chance that they'll kill it."" Garrett warned that PCCRAs would reduce the availability of loans to homeowners, referring to the letters from bankers and lobbyists. ""It is not surprising that the securitization community has already commented that this ill-conceived provision will greatly reduce or even eliminate the securitization market,'' he said in the letter. A few months later, a coalition of bankers, mortgage lenders, and securitizers referred back to, and echoed, Garrett's correspondence in their own comments to the Fed asking for the proposal to be killed or delayed while the agencies perform a cost-benefit analysis. Then they questioned whether the bank regulators had the legal authority to mandate the cash reserve accounts, quoting directly from Garrett's letter. Several weeks later, in March 2012, Garrett wrote another letter reiterating their demands and citing reports by Bank of America and Moody's Analytics that were also cited in at least three bank and trade group comment letters. The Fed and other regulators in August reproposed the rule, this time without the PCCRAs. Sometimes letters are part of a last-ditch effort to postpone rules, after industry has exhausted every opportunity to water them down. When banks and mortgage firms wanted regulators to delay mortgage lending rules required under Dodd-Frank, they relied on Capito, who drafted a letter to the CFPB but sent it first to the American Bankers Association and Consumer Bankers Association. The ABA, in turn, distributed it to its members in state banking groups and urged them to make sure their representatives signed on. When the letter went out on Nov. 5, two weeks after ABA circulated it, 118 House members had signed. At least one state trade group publicly took credit for getting its representatives on board. About a month later, Luetkemeyer and Wagner sent the CFPB a letter whose opening sentences were nearly identical to the language in Capito's letter. ""We wanted as many members of Congress involved as possible ... and certainly when someone with the stature of the chairwoman expresses interest, we want to help as much as we can,"" said James Ballentine, ABA's top lobbyist. Ballentine noted that ABA sent a banker from Capito's home state of West Virginia to testify on the issue. In this way, lawmakers help monied interests harness their networks and resources to create the perception of a popular uprising. The trade groups make it clear to regulators exactly what the industry wants, but the uproar appears to bubble up from below rather than being orchestrated from the top. In effect, Capito helped the ABA create an echo chamber, obscuring the fact that all those voices were coming from the same lobbyists. In this case, the CFPB refused to delay the rule, noting that Congress had established its effective date in the Dodd-Frank Act. The bureau already had spent a year addressing industry's complaints in a series of official interpretations and amendments and produced videos explaining the rules, Director Richard Cordray wrote in a two-page response to Capito. But Chilton, the former regulator, notes that lawmakers' requests consume agencies' attention even when regulators decline to comply. ""For me as a public servant, it's an obligation to meet with people and listen to their case,"" he said. Payday for payday supporters Even the most controversial corners of finance have their champions in the banking caucus. Take payday lenders, widely maligned companies that offer small, short-term loans with steep fees that regulators believe can trap borrowers in a cycle of indebtedness. The CFPB was created in part to oversee such lenders. Facing such federal scrutiny for the first time, payday lenders ramped up their political giving. Donations shot up to $3.3 million in the 2012 election cycle, 11-fold what it had been a decade earlier. Most of the payday industry's top recipients are in the banking caucus identified by the Center for Public Integrity, including Meeks, Stivers, Hensarling, Luetkemeyer, and Wagner. Kansas-based QC Holdings, the biggest political donor in the payday industry this election cycle, has given $33,500 to members of the House committee, including contributions to Wagner, Hensarling, Capito, Garrett, and Stivers. The industry sought shelter from stricter oversight by promoting a bill that would place many payday lenders under the protective umbrella of a federal charter. States with tougher consumer laws would be unable to touch them. Members of the banking caucus have taken up the cause, introducing three versions of the bill even as its original sponsor, former Rep. Joe Baca, left Congress and became CEO of a payday lenders' trade group. After Luetkemeyer introduced a revised version of the bill in 2012, he praised Baca as ""a dedicated leader on this subject."" When Luetkemeyer introduced the third version in April 2013, this time focused on online lenders, Meeks was the first cosponsor to sign on. Stivers joined a month later. Wagner has pushed legislation through the House that would prevent the Labor Department from advancing a rule holding money managers more accountable to clients for the decisions they make about retirement investments. After a sustained outcry from industry, the department agreed in September 2011 to rework the rule and propose it again. It has yet to act, a delay that costs retirement investors billions of dollars a year because of brokers' conflicts of interest, according to research by professors at Indiana University and the University of Texas. Wagner's been richly rewarded; her strongest financial support has come from two industries that would face major costs because of the change: securities and investment firms and insurance companies. In the process, Wagner has distinguished herself as a fundraiser, raising more than $100,000 for her leadership PAC in her first year in office. Among the major donors: Goldman Sachs, Oppenheimer Funds, and three insurance trade groups. The CFPB is particularly reviled by banks and other financial firms that deal with the public because it was created with a broad mandate to regulate consumer products that largely escaped oversight before the crisis. That makes it a frequent target for lawmakers. Duffy of Wisconsin has sponsored at least eight bills to weaken the CFPB since Dodd-Frank established the new consumer agency in 2010. In February, the entire House approved a Duffy bill pushed by bankers that would have made the agency subservient to a council of financial regulators including the Federal Reserve, which historically supported industry's aims. On the House floor, Duffy defended the legislation with a familiar brand of populist, anti-Wall Street rhetoric: He said it would help community banks compete. ""Big banks on Wall Street who created the crisis are given a voice to have rules from the CFPB overturned, but you have left the small banks and credit unions in my district voiceless to say: This rule is going to hurt us,"" said Duffy, who is vice chairman of Capito's consumer credit subcommittee. Goldman Sachs has donated more to Duffy's 2014 re-election effort than any other single financial company or group. None of those bills has become law, but dealing with the animosity has sapped a huge amount of the CFPB's resources. The Financial Services Committee has called CFPB officials to testify 14 times in the past three years, more than any other financial regulator. Overall, agency officials have been called to testify before Congress 46 times in the past three years. Each appearance requires hours of preparation and meetings with key officials who otherwise would be writing and enforcing rules, according to a bureau official familiar with the process. Just one more way the financial industry is able to affect the regulatory process--part of its smoothly effective, multifront war. This story was published by the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative news organization in Washington."	Meet the Congress Members Who Work for Wall Street
23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/okcupid_and_race_is_it_racist_to_date_only_people_of_your_own_race.html	"A few weeks ago, OkCupid, the popular ""freemium"" dating service, started offering its paid subscribers a very cool new tool. Rather than just sort through potential dates by using familiar filters like age and height, you could use the answers OkCupid members gave to various questions, such as ""Do you like to watch sports on television?"" or, my personal favorite, ""Do you find British comedies entertaining?"" Questions are an important part of what makes OkCupid work. The site nudges you to answer as many questions as you can stand, and it also nudges you to make your answers public, as you can only see the answers of potential dates if you disclose your own answers. Answering questions allows OkCupid's fancy algorithms to identify people who might be a good fit for you. Though these algorithms can be cleverly gamed, the basic idea that answering questions honestly will allow you to find people who share your sensibilities, goals, and quirks makes intuitive sense. For example, OKCupid asked, ""Would you date someone shorter than you?"" If, like me, you are a compact American, you could save an enormous amount of time by ruling out women who are uninterested in dating smaller men. All of the time you'd otherwise waste on messaging statuesque beauties could instead be spent indulging in more fruitful leisure time pursuits, like hang-gliding or backgammon. In a somewhat similar vein, one of OkCupid's questions reads as follows: ""Would you strongly prefer to go out with someone of your own skin color/racial background?"" I was struck by the not inconsiderable number of people who answered ""yes""--including some people I know ""in real life,"" many of whom are hilariously self-righteous about their enlightened political views. Keep in mind that OkCupid users can skip a question with ease. The people who answered this question had every opportunity to pass it by. What I found surprising about the fact that a fair number of people answered that they would indeed strongly prefer to go out with someone of their own skin color/racial background was not that this phenomenon exists in the world. Racial preferences in dating are quite common, and women appear to exhibit stronger same-race preferences than men. Rather, I was surprised that people would be willing to openly state that they had strong same-race preferences. One assumes that many people who do have such preferences would either choose not to disclose them publicly, or choose to skip the question entirely. Is a strong same-race preference something one ought to be ashamed of? Or is it enough to say that the heart wants what it wants and to leave it at that? This is a more important question than you might think. Before I start throwing stones, I should note that my upbringing has given me a skewed perspective on American life. When my parents settled in Brooklyn in the mid-1970s, there were only a small handful of Bengali-speaking South Asian Muslims in the city, and so self-segregation wasn't really an option. Like it or not, they had to interact with and rely on people outside of their ethnocultural group. My sisters and I were in the same boat when we went to school. One of my pet theories is that we didn't assimilate into mainstream American culture, a largely imaginary construct that I associate with Brady Bunch reruns. We assimilated into an outer-borough American culture in which it was assumed that everyone was ""ethnic,"" that everyone belonged to some religious minority or another, and that of course you'd constantly be mingling with people who looked different from you, because that was an inescapable fact of life. Brooklyn in this era was hardly a paradise of interethnic harmony. Crude racism occasionally reared its head. Even so, I definitely felt more typical than strange in being an American-born child of immigrants, and diversity in my world was so pervasive that I found its absence really jarring. Had I been born a few years later or a few years earlier, however, it's entirely possible that I would have either found a crew of co-ethnics with whom to bond or I would have felt like much more of an outsider. But instead I grew up in an in-between moment in which people didn't have a strong sense of what people like me were supposed to be like, and so I at least felt that I had the breathing room to define myself. I thought of my ""group"" as including all ""ethnics,"" whether they were Chinese or Haitian or Puerto Rican or Russian Jewish, and I suppose I still think the same way. The fact that I don't have a strong same-race preference is not the product of some moral superiority on my part, but rather the idiosyncratic circumstances of my early years. And so I'm disinclined to judge those who do have strong same-race preferences too harshly. Nevertheless, I do feel comfortable judging them guilty of being clueless. There are good reasons to question the moral appropriateness of strong same-race preferences and their close cousin, in-group favoritism. In The American Non-Dilemma, Nancy DiTomaso argues that persistent racial inequality in the United States is not solely or even primarily a reflection of racism and discrimination. Rather, it reflects the fact that whites tend to help other whites without ever discriminating against or behaving cruelly toward blacks and other nonwhites. As long as whites tend to dominate prestigious occupations, and as long as they control access to valuable social resources like access to good schools, the fact that whites, like all people, will do more to help family, friends, and acquaintances than strangers will tend to entrench racial inequality, provided that white people choose to associate primarily with other whites. DiTomaso observes that while Americans place very high value on the idea of equal opportunity, virtually all of us seek ""unequal opportunity"" in our own lives by leveraging our intimate relationships to achieve our goals, including our professional goals. Yet most of us don't see the help of family and friends as an unfair leg up. This kind of ""opportunity hoarding"" is accepted as par for the course. We could make an effort to eliminate in-group favoritism, but such an effort would inevitably fail, as in-group favoritism is a powerful human impulse. A more sensible course of action would be to do our part to expand the boundaries of the in-group. And by doing our part, I mean doing more than piling on when some minor celebrity or politician is accused of racism, or holding ""rednecks"" in casual contempt for their (supposedly) backward views. In ""The Duty to Miscegenate,"" one of the more provocative Ph.D. dissertations I've ever read, the philosopher Nathaniel Adam Tobias Coleman argues that the fundamental problem with the prohibitions against ""race-mixing"" that were on the books in much of the United States until the late 1960s is that they strengthened the social stigmatization of people of African descent--not just that they were discriminatory. These legal penalties were not the source of this social stigmatization, and repealing them did not bring it to an end. Whereas discrimination is about denying an individual access to some benefit, stigmatization is about the damage stereotypes can do to our public reputations, and how the fear of living up to, or down to, our race-based reputations can warp our lives. According to Coleman, the surest way to break down stigma is to reduce anxiety about intergroup contact and to fight ""emotional and perceptual segregation."" Despite the title of his dissertation, Coleman does not see intermarriage as a solution, as ""the production of cross-caste children has proved unreliable in giving rise to cross-caste commonality."" Rather, he emphasizes the importance of routinely putting members of different castes on an equal deliberative footing by encouraging the sharing of cross-caste meals, or ""inter-dining."" Eating together can serve as a solid basis for companionship, a word that is itself rooted in the sharing of bread. The rural white Southerner who dines with nonwhites as a matter of course is doing more to tackle stigma than the urbane white hipster who hardly ever does the same. As trivial as the sharing of meals might sound, it is not clear to me that it is any less important than supporting racial equality as a purely abstract matter. This is particularly true for those of us--most of us--who claim to support racial equality while engaging in the kind of in-group favoritism that entrenches racial inequality. To be sure, dating is about more than the sharing of bread, and OkCupid users who express strong racial preferences may well be doing the world a favor by being open and honest about their wants. But I don't think it's too much to ask those who do express such preferences, and those who live them in practice, to reflect on them, and on how there might be more to fighting racism than voting ""the right way."""	Is It Racist to Date Only People of Your Own Race?
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/national_review_is_wrong_on_racial_discrimination_conservatives_have_been.html	"The right has always been against race-conscious remedies to racial discrimination, touting ""colorblindness"" as the ""constitutional"" approach to making policy. But it's only been in the last five years--since the election of Barack Obama--that it's scored significant victories. Led by figures like Hans von Spakovsky--a former Bush official who once accused the Obama Justice Department of anti-white racism--and boosted by conservatives on the Supreme Court, the right has chipped away at affirmative action and the Voting Rights Act, while using their state-level clout to limit voting with strict ID requirements and attacks on early and weekend voting. But there's still more to do. Von Spakovsky--and his frequent collaborator, Roger Clegg of the misnamed Center for Equal Opportunity--have gone after congressional remedies to the court ruling, calling it a "" 'get out of jail free' card to black elected officials in the South, where they can discriminate all they want against white voters."" They are prepping an assault on Section 2 of the VRA, which bars actions that cause racial discrimination in voting, even if that's not the intent. They've also opened a new front in the war against civil rights laws, with an attack on the Civil Rights Act itself. ""Discrimination on the basis of race and ethnicity is unconstitutional, unlawful, and morally repugnant, yet the practice is rife throughout federal law and government programs,"" wrote Clegg, von Spakovsky, and Elizabeth Slattery in National Review this week. What they mean, of course, are the laws and regulations designed to prevent and ameliorate the effects of racial bias in hiring, education, voting, and other areas. To use a quote from Chief Justice John Roberts, a fellow traveler in the fight to end race-consciousness, ""The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race."" Von Spakovsky, Clegg, and Slattery focus their fire on the doctrine of ""disparate impact,"" which treats neutral actions with racially disproportionate outcomes as illegal, if--for example--a business or institution can't justify a practice as necessary to the job. For them, ""Eliminating such claims is therefore another way to help curb the use of racial and ethnic preferences."" But this is ahistorical nonsense. ""Disparate impact"" exists because discrimination was often achieved by neutral means. During Jim Crow, for instance, explicitly discriminatory voting was illegal. White Southerners could block blacks from using public facilities or mandate segregated businesses, but they couldn't bar blacks from voting. Hence the poll tax and the literacy test. In theory, they were universal requirements--everyone was vulnerable to failing the test or lacking the funds to pay a tax. In practice, of course, extreme poverty and deprivation meant that ex-slaves and their descendants were most likely to fail the test or lack the funds. The same went for felon disenfranchisement; in theory, everyone who committed the felony of vagrancy or theft could lose his or her voting rights. In practice, however, these crimes were selectively applied to blacks. It's for this reason that lawmakers built disparate impact into the 1964 Civil Rights Act (Title VII) and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967. Even today, disparate impact is critical to fairness in employment, housing, and other fields. The Obama administration has used disparate impact claims to win settlements from banks accused of predatory lending toward minorities. The simple fact is that racial bias is still alive in vast areas of American life, and most people who discriminate are too smart to broadcast their prejudice. To von Spakovsky, Clegg, and Slattery, however, these measures are as bad, if not worse, than racism against minorities. It doesn't matter that racial inequities move from generation to generation, propelled by the force of past and present discrimination; for these conservatives, any acknowledgment of race is racism, and anti-racist policies--like federal civil rights laws--are a zero-sum game, with whites as the losers. I mentioned at the beginning that the right has always been against race-conscious laws. That's understating the case. Movement conservatives are the most prominent proponents of the ""colorblind"" approach to law and policy, but they merely picked up the baton from previous opponents of race-conscious policy. Take President Andrew Johnson, who vetoed the 1866 civil rights bill with a message that echoes von Spakovsky's view that the ""real racists"" are those who take race into consideration. ""In all our experience as a people living under Federal and State law,"" writes the unpopular (and soon-to-be impeached) president, ""no such system as that contemplated by the details of this bill has ever before been proposed or adopted. They establish for the security of the colored race safeguards which go indefinitely beyond any that the General Government has ever provided for the white race."" In fact, he continues, ""the distinction of race and color is by the bill made to operate in favor of the colored against the white race."" This was borrowed later by Justice Joseph P. Bradley in his ruling against the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which he struck down as unconstitutional. Bradley wrote:"	How Not to End Racial Discrimination
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/chelsea_clinton_is_pregnant_don_t_worry_if_her_baby_becomes_president.html	"On Thursday afternoon Chelsea Clinton announced she was pregnant, and immediately political reporters began to complain about the ""Clinton dynasty."" ""Can you say dynasty?"" wrote the staff of the Week magazine. Those words were echoed quickly by the Wire, which answered the question of when the gestating child would be eligible for the White House. (2053, if you're wondering.) More broadly, the prospect of another Bush/Clinton presidential race--between Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush--has spawned a cottage industry of handwringing over American ""aristocrats."" ""Could it be Clinton vs. Bush all over again?"" wondered Bloomberg. ""Forward into the past: another Bush or Clinton in the White House?"" asked CNN. ""Clinton vs. Bush again, really?"" complained conservative website Breitbart. Likewise, there have been similar grumblings about the high profile of political children in this year's Senate and gubernatorial races, from Jason ""grandson of Jimmy"" Carter and Michelle ""daughter of Sam"" Nunn in Georgia, to Alison Lundergan Grimes in Kentucky, whose father--Jerry Lundergan--was a former state representative and party chairman. I get the frustration. As former first lady Barbara Bush said in a recent interview on C-SPAN, ""If we can't find more than two or three families to run for office, that's silly, because there are great governors and great eligible people to run."" Setting aside the fact that the Clintons aren't a dynasty--they are a smart and ambitious married couple who've given us one generation of officeholders--we should remember that powerful families and political dynasties are a long-standing part of American politics. In fact, they've been with us since the beginning. Just look at the signers of the Constitution. Of the 40 delegates who signed the document, just a handful came from humble origins. Most were comfortable men from prosperous families, and a few came from prominent backgrounds. From Virginia there was John Blair, the son of a royal governor. From South Carolina there was Charles Cotesworth ""C.C."" Pinckney and his cousin, Charles Pinckney, who came from a powerful family of planters and slave owners. Along with Thomas Pinckney, brother to C.C. and cousin to Charles, they would go on to serve as presidential candidates (C.C.), governors of South Carolina (Charles and Thomas), House members (Thomas), and senators (Charles). And James Madison--the most influential of the constitutional architects--was son to one of the wealthiest landowners and tobacco growers in Virginia. Indeed, prominent families were a mainstay of the early American republic. Beyond John Adams and John Quincy Adams (the second and sixth presidents of the United States, respectively), there was Bushrod Washington (nephew of George Washington and associate justice on the Supreme Court), Chief Justice John Marshall (cousin to Thomas Jefferson), Thomas Mann Randolph Jr. (son-in-law to Jefferson and 21st governor of Virginia), and John Van Buren (son to Martin Van Buren and attorney general of New York). There was also the Harrison clan, which included Benjamin Harrison V--signatory on the Declaration of Independence--his sons William Henry Harrison (ninth president) and Carter Harrison (both of whom served in the House of Representatives), grandson John Scott Harrison (who served in the House of Representatives), and great-grandson Benjamin Harrison (23rd president). You can play this game for almost every president and vice president in the early-to-mid-19th century. President John Tyler's father was a governor of Virginia, and President Franklin Pierce's, a governor of New Hampshire. The Breckinridges dominated Kentucky politics, with senators, House members, and eventually a vice president (John Cabell Breckinridge). Jump forward to the first half of the 20th century, and you have the Roosevelts, the Tafts--who gave us a president (William Howard), a senator and famously unsuccessful presidential candidate (Robert Taft Sr.), another senator (Robert Taft Jr.), and a governor (Robert Taft III), among others--and the beginnings of the Bush clan. And from there, we have the Rockefellers, the Romneys, and of course, the Kennedys. All of this is to say there's nothing remarkable about the prominence of the Bush and Clinton families, nor is there anything unusual about their national reach. As with the Bushes--who have held office in Connecticut, Texas, and Florida--the major families of the 1800s populated the politics of large and influential states. Insofar that there's anything strange about the current period, it's the number of consecutive years two families held the highest office. If either Hillary Clinton or Jeb Bush runs and wins in 2016, one member from two families will have held the White House for 24 of the 32 years between 1988 and 2020.* I'm not worried about this for the same reason I'm not worried about long-serving elected officials. Yes, there's a lot of power that comes with being a known quantity and having the automatic support of donors and elites in your party. But victory is rarely guaranteed, and if voters don't want to support a dynastic candidate (or 30-year congressman), they won't. It's one reason Hillary Clinton lost in 2008, and if Jeb Bush decides to run for the Republican nomination, he'll have to contend with it as well. Still, depending on how it goes, 2016 will be the last year for a while we'll have a Bush or Clinton running for national office. And by the time Chelsea Clinton or George P. Bush decides to make a splash, there's a chance their names won't matter as much, or--more likely--they'll be overshadowed by a new group of prominent families. *Correction, April 18, 2014: This article originally misstated that the Bush and Clinton families have dominated the presidency since 1992. They have dominated the presidency since 1988."	Why Political Dynasties Are Part of America

He failed. Not only did Mayors Against Illegal Guns fail to save universal background checks from Republican opposition in the Senate, but it alienated ostensible allies, running ads against vulnerable Democrats like Sens. Mark Pryor in Arkansas and Kay Hagan in North Carolina, as if they were the main obstacle to passing gun-control legislation. What's more, the creation of the Bloomberg-led organization was fortuitous for the National Rifle Association, which needed a bogeyman for its members as it worked to block Congress and other gun-control advocates. ""[President Obama's] rich, gun-hating friends in Hollywood, along with anti-gun billionaire Michael Bloomberg, will shower him with the money he needs to strip you of your gun rights,"" wrote NRA chief lobbyist Chris Cox in an email blast to members asking for cash. After a year of fear-mongering--with Bloomberg as an effective foil--the NRA smashed its fundraising records. By September, the pro-gun group had raised $51 million, $1 million more than its total in 2012. Indeed, the anti-Bloomberg strategy is so effective that the NRA has recycled it for this year's elections. In a column for the Daily Caller, NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre warned that--if Democrats prevailed--gun rights were at risk. ""This year's elections,"" he wrote, ""will decide whether we stop the Barack Obama-Joe Biden-Michael Bloomberg gun-ban machine and save the right to keep and bear arms--or lose much of our Second Amendment freedoms for generations to come."" With that said, the collapse of Mayors Against Illegal Guns hasn't stopped Bloomberg from re-entering the fray with another commitment to pushing gun control. As the New York Times reports, the former New York mayor has pledged $50 million to a new campaign for gun restrictions. This time, however, he plans to take the NRA on its own turf and challenge its grassroots dominance. For Bloomberg, the NRA's core advantage is its ability to make a credible threat:"	Why the NRA Loves Michael Bloomberg
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/america_s_future_racial_makeup_will_today_s_hispanics_be_tomorrow_s_whites.html	"The Trayvon Martin shooting was hardly in the national consciousness before fault lines emerged around the case. Was Martin as innocent as he seemed? Did Zimmerman fear for his life? Did Martin provoke the incident? Was Zimmerman a racist? Perhaps most controversial among all of these was the question of identity. Yes, Trayvon Martin was black, but is Zimmerman white? For Martin's sympathizers, the answer was yes. For Zimmerman's, the answers ranged from ""it doesn't matter"" to he ""is actually a Hispanic nonracist person who acted in self-defense."" In their early reports on the case, both CNN and the New York Times labeled him ""white Hispanic,"" sparking thunderous condemnation from right-wing critics. At Fox News, contributor Bernard Goldberg accused the Times of race-baiting. ""I guarantee you that if George Zimmerman did something good--if he finished first in his high school graduating class when he was younger--they wouldn't refer to him as a white Hispanic, he'd just be a Hispanic,"" he wrote. Likewise, National Review's Jonah Goldberg blasted several news outlets for ""playing the race card"" with the term. And in typical paranoid style, Breitbart's Ben Shapiro accused CNN of ""labeling Zimmerman a 'white Hispanic' in order to maintain the false narrative that the killing was race-based."" For good reason, this debate--whether the half-Peruvian Zimmerman was ""Hispanic"" or ""white""--was quickly overshadowed by the activism and acrimony around Martin's killing. But it's not unimportant, as it reflects the tension and confusion over race in a changing America and offers a 21st-century spin on one of the oldest questions in American life: Who is white? This debate is useful to keep in mind as we sift through the information in the Pew Research Center's new--and massive--look at America's shifting demographics. According to Pew--and echoing the results in the last census--the United States is just a few decades away from its demographic inflection point. Come 2050, only 47 percent of Americans will call themselves white, while the majority will belong to a minority group. Blacks will remain steady at 13 percent of the population, while Asians will grow to 8 percent. Hispanics, on the other hand, will explode to 28 percent of all U.S. population, up from 19 percent in 2010. Immigration is driving this ""demographic makeover,"" specifically the ""40 million immigrants who have arrived since 1965, about half of them Hispanics and nearly three-in-ten Asians."" But the thing to remember about the Hispanic category, for instance, is that it contains a wide range of colors and ethnicities. In the United States, Hispanics (or more broadly Latinos) include Afro-Brazilians, dark-skinned Puerto Ricans, indigenous Mexicans, Venezuelan mestizos, and European Argentinians, among others. To say that America will become a majority-minority country is to erase these distinctions and assume that, for now and forever, Latinos will remain a third race, situated next to ""non-Hispanic blacks"" and ""non-Hispanic whites."" But, as the Zimmerman controversy illustrates, it's not that simple. American racial categories are far from fixed, and who counts as white is extremely fluid. ""A hundred years ago,"" writes Ian Haney Lopez in Dog Whistle Politics, ""firm racial lines elevated Anglo-Saxons over the supposedly degenerate races from southern and eastern Europe."" For a large chunk of the 19th century--and a good deal of the 20th--America's intellectual energy was devoted to policing the boundaries of ""whiteness."" Race ""scientists"" like William Z. Ripley measured human skulls and examined living standards to delineate the ""races"" of Europe, linking head shape to supposedly racial qualities like beauty and intelligence. Others used these supposedly objective factors to exclude a variety of different groups--Irish, Italians, Eastern Europeans--from the American racial category, envisioned as a white person of British or German stock. ""White race taxonomy,"" writes Nell Irvin Painter in The History of White People, ""was evolving into notions of immigration restriction and eugenics."" Over time, however, as new immigrants entered the country and old ones gained access to levers of power and influence, the boundaries grew to include them. As Painter explains, ""In their penury and apparent strangeness, the new [Southern and Eastern European] immigrants after 1880 made Irish and Germans immigrants and ... their more prosperous, better-educated descendants seem acceptably American."" It's hard to say history is repeating itself--the circumstances of the early 21st century are vastly different from those of the late 19th--but the current period does seem to rhyme with the past. Over the last 50 years of large-scale Latino and Asian immigration, we've seen waves of anti-immigrant hysteria (Proposition 187 in California and the minutemen along the Mexican border), attempts to keep high-achieving immigrants and their children out of elite institutions, and intermarriage leading to assimilation--one of the most famous comedians in the world, Louis C.K., is half-Mexican, but to most Americans, he's just a white guy. Which is to say that, before we begin to say anything about our majority-minority future, we have to consider the ways in which our existing social dynamics and racial boundaries will change in response to the demographic shift. Going forward, will white Hispanics see themselves as part of a different race--light-skinned but distinct from whites--or will they see themselves as another kind of white? Will the government treat them as white in its forms and surveys, and will so-called traditional white Americans understand them as such? What about the children of mixed marriages? As Pew points out, we live in an age of intermarriage. More than 15 percent of new marriages are between partners of different races, and the large majority of them are Hispanic and Asian ""out marriage"" to whites. Will these children retain a racial identity, or will they join the vast tapestry of American whiteness? These are critical questions, since--in a country where white Hispanics are just white, and Asians intermarry at high rates--the white population of the United States could stay steady or actually grow. Of course, not all Hispanics and Asians will enter the white mainstream. We don't see them in popular culture, but there are sharp racial and class divisions in both groups. Low-income, dark-skinned Latinos and Pacific Islanders, for instance, face prejudice, racism, and a huge array of socio-economic challenges. And going forward, that might stay the same, as their fair-skinned, more affluent counterparts ""become"" white. Or, put another way, now might be the last time we have a public debate over the whiteness of a figure like George Zimmerman. To Americans of 2050, the answer would be obvious: ""Of course he is."" Pew ends its description of our changing demographics with a small rhetorical flourish: ""We were once a black and white country. Now, we're a rainbow."" Or are we? After all, while we see the 19th century as a world of blacks and whites, that wasn't true for Americans at the time. They saw their United States as diverse as we see ours--a hodgepodge of races and ethnicities, with blacks as the insoluble element. The difference was their construction of race, which placed various Europeans on a convoluted hierarchy of racial difference. Our hierarchies are a little flatter, and--in public life, at least--we aren't as obsessed with racial boundaries. But both still exist, and they take a familiar form: whites at the top, blacks at the bottom. The future could make a collection of minorities the majority in America, or it could broaden our definition of white, leaving us with a remix of the black-and-white binary. A country where some white people are Asian, some are Hispanic, and the dark-skinned citizens of America--and blacks especially--is still a world apart."	Will Today's Hispanics Be Tomorrow's Whites?
28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/jeb_bush_may_win_the_nomination_gop_donors_matter_the_party_s_base_does.html	"Yes, he's out of touch with the Republican base, out of shape on the campaign trail, and burdened by the disastrous presidency of his older brother, but Jeb Bush could win the Republican presidential nomination. To make it to the top, however, he'll have to do one thing: Make ""Jeb Bush"" disappear. As it stands, the former Florida governor is anathema to the rank and file of the Republican Party. This weekend, in the key presidential primary state of New Hampshire, conservative activists gathered to listen and judge a handful of presidential aspirants, from all but official candidates like Sens. Rand Paul and Ted Cruz to people flirting with a run like Donald Trump and Mike Huckabee. Each speaker made his pitch. Paul focused on civil liberties and promised to expand the GOP tent with a hands-off approach to gay marriage and other issues. Cruz billed himself as an avatar of conservative orthodoxy--an economic conservative, a social conservative, and a national security conservative. Huckabee indulged in right-wing hyperbole--""My gosh, I'm beginning to think that there's more freedom in North Korea sometimes than there is in the United States""--and Donald Trump said Donald Trump things. But insofar that there was a rhetorical constant, it was open disdain for Jeb Bush, as candidates responded to his sympathy for undocumented immigrants and praise for federal education standards. ""Get rid of Common Core and replace it with common sense!"" said Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn, taking a swipe at Bush's support for the reformed curriculum standards. ""I think what Jeb was trying to say was that many people come to the United States to look for opportunity,"" said Huckabee, commenting on Bush's support for comprehensive immigration reform. ""I don't personally support amnesty. I think we ought to have a secure border."" Trump also riffed on Bush's immigration comments, mocking the notion that immigrants come to the United States out of ""love."" ""[T]hat's one I've never heard of before,"" Trump said. ""I've heard money, I've heard this, I've heard sex, I've heard everything! The one thing I never heard of was love. I understand what he's saying, but, you know, it's out there, I'll tell you."" More importantly, the mere mention of Bush's name drew boos from the crowd, who oppose the former governor's immigration leniency. The standard take is that Bush's weak support among grassroots conservatives is nearly fatal for his presidential chances, and there's no doubt that it puts him at a disadvantage. Bush has been out of the game for so long that he's out of step with the base of the party. They want a full-scale assault on the welfare state, not compassion or empathy. Then again, this is an old problem. The Republican Party has a long history of nominating candidates who anger and enrage the base. In 1996 there was Bob Dole, in 2008 there was John McCain, and in 2012--after three years of anti-establishment, Tea Party rage--Republicans nominated Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts who pioneered universal health insurance for his state. Yes, the actual energy of the party was with Romney's competitors, from Texas Gov. Rick Perry to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. But Romney was the establishment choice. In addition to the cash and organization this provides, it sends a powerful message to the party writ large: ""You may not agree with Romney on every choice, but we believe he could win the presidency."" The imprimatur of the GOP's donor class may not sway every activist and Republican primary voter, but it's a huge asset to whoever has it and almost guarantees the nomination. If Jeb Bush has anything on his side right now, it's this--the establishment stamp of approval. Just read this Washington Post story from late last month, where a parade of Republican donors and officials showed their enthusiasm for a Bush candidacy. Yes, there are still arguments and divisions among Republican elites, but one thing is clear: If Bush steps into the ring, he'll begin the race with key victories in the ""invisible primary,"" where candidates fight to win influence and endorsements from the party's most moneyed supporters. Even still, this doesn't make the grassroots irrelevant as much as it changes the nature of the challenge. No, the Republican base isn't strong or influential enough to drive a candidate to the nomination or to kill the candidacy of someone with establishment support. What it can do, however, is extract concessions in the form of policy promises and rhetorical strategies. This is what happened to Mitt Romney. Strong elite backing made him the favorite for the nomination, but he still had to appeal to rank-and-file Republican voters. After all, you still need to win primaries. So, he disavowed his previous self, condemning the Affordable Care Act as an abomination of public policy and dashing to the right on immigration. He gave his full commitment to the priorities of the Republican base, which--along with the help of the establishment--won him the nomination. In other words, for Mitt Romney the Republican presidential candidate to become Mitt Romney the Republican presidential nominee, he had to go back in time and effectively destroy Mitt Romney, the moderate Massachusetts governor. ""Jeb Bush, former Florida governor"" is much more conservative than Romney was at the same stage of his career, and he won't have to shift gears on health care reform or abortion. Still, if Bush has appeal to Republican elites, it's because of his moderate affect--he's not a fire-breather--and pragmatic approach to immigration and education, legacies of his tenure in Florida. And that's the ""Jeb Bush"" that has to go. To win the invisible primary and prevail with voters, Bush will have to sacrifice the most moderate aspects of his persona and commit to the main concerns of the rank and file. Or, put another way, there's a good chance that any Jeb Bush who represents the entire Republican Party will be a Jeb Bush who opposes comprehensive immigration reform, shows strong skepticism for federal education programs, and adopts the usual bromides against President Obama and the Democratic Party. It's a Jeb Bush who--if he truly wants to win the nomination--may have to disavow his brother and father, too. Few Republicans will defend the eldest Bush, who worked with Democrats to raise taxes and earned the animosity of a generation of conservatives. By contrast, GOP opinion on George W. Bush is divided. Among elites, he's a distinguished ex-president. To many activists, however, he's a big spender who jeopardized conservative principles. And that's to say nothing of the general public, which still blames the second President Bush for our sluggish economy. For Jeb Bush to win, he may have to do more than bury his former political persona--he may have to bury the Bush name."	Why Jeb Bush May Win the Nomination
29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/legalizing_internet_gambling_sheldon_adelson_casinos_offshore_companies.html	"Ever since Bugsy Siegel opened the Flamingo Hotel in 1946 and launched the Las Vegas Strip, gambling has held a tenuous position in American life, suggesting glamour, wealth, and corruption all at once. Now that casinos have spread nationwide and allegedly shed their mafia ties, a new branch of the industry is fighting for legitimacy. Las Vegas-based casinos and overseas operators have begun an all-out battle over Internet gambling, which is mostly banned nationwide but carries with it the promise of billions of dollars in additional revenue for casinos and state governments. Three states began licensing online betting last year, and Congress is facing increasing pressure to either bar or regulate the fledgling industry. The moves are coming in response to a concerted push orchestrated by a colorful cast of characters, including Sheldon Adelson, one of the most prolific political donors of the super PAC era, an offshore company that only recently settled federal allegations of money laundering and bank fraud, and a pair of benignly named political advocacy groups backed by big-time casino cash. Adelson, a prominent backer of conservative political causes and head of the Las Vegas Sands casino empire, has pledged to spend ""whatever it takes"" to get Congress to ban Internet gambling outright. In March, Sen. Lindsey Graham and Rep. Jason Chaffetz introduced a bill that was written with the help of Adelson's lobbyists to achieve that goal. Meanwhile, industry giants like Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts have taken the opposite tack, banding together in an effort to legalize and tap into the growing market. Maneuvering quietly in the background are foreign entities, including the Isle-of-Man-based PokerStars, the world's biggest online poker operator. As a whole, the casino industry is among the most generous in giving to political candidates across the country. According to figures from the Center for Responsive Politics and the National Institute on Money in State Politics, the gambling industry contributed $287.6 million to state and federal campaigns from 2009 to 2012 (state data for 2013 aren't yet available). All together, these interest groups spent $8.2 million lobbying the federal government on Internet gambling last year, according to the trade publisher GamblingCompliance, and millions more in state capitals from Trenton to Sacramento. And while Washington has drawn much of the recent attention, the real action may come in the states. New Jersey, Nevada, and Delaware have already legalized online gambling, and lawmakers are debating the issue in seven other states right now. In these capitals, the promise of gambling profits is mixing with a need to plug budget gaps. Lawmakers face pressure to boost revenues, while proponents of online gambling are dangling the issue as a pain-free ""voluntary tax."" And so other states seem sure to follow--and there may be little that Sheldon Adelson or anyone else can do about that. Original Sin For years, online betting was neither forbidden nor permitted explicitly by state or federal laws. The Department of Justice had long argued that the 1961 Wire Act, passed to limit bookies' use of interstate telegraphs, prohibited all forms of betting online. Others disagreed, arguing that the act applied only to sporting events. But with the issue unresolved, a handful of companies began offering gambling online to American players beginning in the late 1990s, operating out of loosely regulated offshore locales. Online poker took a hit in 2011, though, when the Justice Department sued several of the biggest operators, including PokerStars. Prosecutors portrayed an elaborate scheme to deceive banks, which were barred from processing online gambling payments, saying executives had established fake online businesses with names like www.petfoodstore.biz to hide transactions worth billions. The companies eventually settled the suit without admitting guilt, but the day became known as Black Friday in the industry after it decimated the country's online offerings. Then later that same year, the department quietly reversed its opinion in response to an inquiry from the New York and Illinois lotteries, saying the Wire Act applied only to betting on sporting events. The opinion explained that the new interpretation was more consistent with the intent and language of both the Wire Act and a 2006 law that targeted illegal online gambling transactions. But some industry observers have questioned whether the decision, released on the Friday before Christmas, may also have been a political concession to the casinos and their powerful allies, including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.  Either way, states suddenly could begin regulating online gambling within their borders. The politically savvy online firms were ready. Some had hired their own lobbyists in D.C. years earlier. In 2005, a plucky young group called the Poker Players Alliance had appeared and quickly became the most prominent advocate for the online gambling cause, donating money to politicians, hiring former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York, and testifying at hearings. The alliance was formed as a ""grassroots"" advocacy group--and political contribution fund--by a handful of prominent poker players. But federal tax filings published by the website citizenaudit.org show that nearly all of its money in its first year came from $1.1 million given by Ruth Parasol and James Russell DeLeon, a married couple who started PartyGaming, one of the world's largest online poker companies. The couple, both native Californians, were living in Gibraltar at the time, and their company eventually entered into a ""non-prosecution"" agreement with the Justice Department in 2009, exchanging a $105 million fine and an admission that some of its past dealings had been ""contrary to certain U.S. laws"" for a pledge from the Justice Department not to prosecute the company. (PartyGaming had pulled out of the United States after Congress passed the 2006 Internet gambling transactions law.) PartyGaming later merged with another company to become Bwin.party, which currently holds about 40 percent of New Jersey's Internet gambling market in its partnership with the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa, in Atlantic City. John Shepherd, a spokesman for Bwin.party, said the company had some contact with the Poker Players Alliance prior to 2006, but that the couple gave their own money and that the company has never donated to the group. In October, Bwin.party announced that Parasol and DeLeon would divest their 14 percent stake as part of the company's application for a license to operate in New Jersey. But even if Bwin.party hasn't supported the alliance, other online gambling companies have: the majority of its funds come from the industry, said John Pappas, the group's executive director, including from PokerStars' parent company, the Rational Group, which declined to comment for this article. The alliance is particularly focused on countering Sheldon Adelson's push to win a federal ban on online gambling. Adelson has been lobbying Congress through the Las Vegas Sands Corp. and has begun a broader campaign through a group he started last year called the Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling. When the coalition posted a message on its Facebook page showing an image of a child in front of a computer and warning of a ""threat to kids,"" the Poker Players Alliance urged members to fight back. When Adelson's top political adviser testified that same month in front of a Congressional panel in support of a ban, Pappas was there too, arguing that millions of Americans are already gambling over the Internet, and that legalizing the practice would make it easier to protect those gamblers from criminal activity and addiction. It's all good theater that is suddenly attracting a lot of attention--but the battle between these heavyweights may result in a stalemate. Meanwhile, the states are moving ahead. An American market By some accounts, the push for legalizing online gambling through the states can be traced back to a 2009 meeting between New Jersey state senator Raymond Lesniak and lobbyist Joe Brennan Jr., who ran a Washington D.C.-based industry group called the Interactive Media Entertainment and Gaming Association, which represented online gambling companies. Lesniak had caught Brennan's attention when he introduced a bill to legalize sports betting, but Brennan had another idea: Why not legalize gambling over the Internet? In online betting, Lesniak saw hope for Atlantic City: a new form of gambling to draw younger clientele and help the state's struggling casinos, which had been losing money for three straight years because of increasing competition in nearby states. Lesniak proved to be a dogged sponsor, and with help from a lobbying push by Princeton Public Affairs Group--one of New Jersey's most influential lobbying firms, which was hired by Brennan's group--was able to win passage of a bill in January 2011. It took two more years, though, and the support of Caesars and the other casinos, before Gov. Chris Christie signed an amended version of the legislation. The casinos spent $1.2 million on lobbying in the state in 2012 and 2013, once they threw their support behind the measure. The offshore companies were active as well. The Interactive Gaming Council, a Vancouver-based industry association for online gambling companies, spent another $253,700, and PokerStars' parent company, Rational Services, spent $204,353 last year. Pappas met with Christie's staff in January 2013, urging him to sign the bill, and the Poker Players Alliance rewarded the bill's sponsors. The organization, Pappas, and four prominent poker players gave Lesniak's campaign a total of $15,600 after the law passed last year, along with $2,000 to the Union County Democratic Committee, which contributed money to Lesniak's campaign. The online gambling bill faced little opposition. But the revenue from Internet gambling has so far proved disappointing. The casinos pulled in $27.2 million from late November, when the new websites began, through the end of February. At that rate, revenue will fall well short of the $200-$300 million analysts had forecast for the first year. Even so, other states and casino firms still envision a potential bonanza. By the time Christie had signed the law, Nevada and Delaware had passed their own online gambling laws, with Nevada legalizing only poker. Several other states are looking at Internet gambling this year, including Massachusetts, California, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, and Mississippi, where a bill was introduced but failed to pass. Lawmakers in Louisiana have held hearings. One issue is driving the debate in these states: Can Internet casinos generate new revenue to help close widening budget gaps? Nowhere is that question more pressing than in Pennsylvania. Keystone Cash Pennsylvania's ornate state capitol sits high on a hill overlooking Harrisburg and the Susquehanna River. The building dates back to a more prosperous time in the Keystone State's history, when wealthy industrialists like Andrew Carnegie drove a growing industrial economy. Today there are plenty of reasons to worry. Pennsylvania is facing a $1 billion deficit and the state's profitable casino industry has stopped growing. Pennsylvania and neighboring states have increased the number of allowable forms of gambling, boosting competition. Last year was the first time that Pennsylvania's casino revenue did not grow since gambling was legalized in 2004. The state takes 55 percent of revenue from slots and 14 percent from table games. ""It's about revenue,"" said state Sen. Kim Ward, who chairs the Community, Economic and Recreational Development Committee. ""Because every year we're in a budget squeeze."" In December, the state Senate funded a study to look at updating its gambling regulations and allowing Internet gambling in an effort to boost revenue. The report is due by May 1, in time for this year's budget debate. Rep. Tina Davis, a Democrat, had already introduced a bill to legalize online gambling last year. But Republicans control both chambers and are likely to write their own bill if they decide to move forward after the report comes out. The state's stake in the casinos' revenue gives the industry a powerful tool to influence policy, said Barry Kauffman, executive director of Common Cause Pennsylvania. All told, various interest groups spent $7.4 million lobbying on gambling and wagering issues last year in Pennsylvania, with Adelson's Las Vegas Sands spending nearly $234,000, the most of the big casinos. PokerStars spent $42,500 lobbying in Pennsylvania in 2013. Unlike in New Jersey, however, there's opposition in both parties to allowing online gambling, and Republicans in the House have introduced bills to ban it. Adelson runs a casino in the state, so he carries considerable weight. In February, state Rep. Mario Scavello, a Republican, introduced a bill to create criminal penalties for gambling online. Adelson's Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling quickly issued supportive statements, and the Poker Players Alliance called its members to action with the opposite goal, directing people to flood Scavello's Facebook page with angry comments, which the representative later deleted. But with New Jersey already in the game next door, some lawmakers appear determined to adopt online gambling, even if it doesn't happen this year. ""I do think at some point we will be moving forward with this,"" Ward said. The Battle Royale Meanwhile, the Washington lobbying game is ramping up again, driven largely by Adelson's new push to ban online gambling. Adelson had already begun pressing for a ban through Las Vegas Sands, which spent $320,000 on lobbying in Washington last year. But his formation of the Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling signaled a new phase in the political influence game. The group hired former New York Gov. George Pataki, former Sen. Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, and former Denver Mayor Wellington Webb as national co-chairmen, and kicked off a national media campaign to convince the public of the ills of online gambling. In February, the group released its first television ad, which warns that ""disreputable gaming interests are lobbying hard to spread Internet gambling throughout the country."" The group also secured signatures from 15 state attorneys general on a letter expressing their concern about online gambling and urging Congress to restore the Justice Department's initial interpretation of the Wire Act; in March, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina sent their own letters in favor of a ban. Meanwhile, Las Vegas Sands lobbyists were reportedly circulating draft legislation to achieve this goal, a copy of which was published in January by poker blogger Marco Valerio. In late March, the campaign scored a major victory with the Graham-Chaffetz bill to ban online gambling. M.J. Henshaw, a spokeswoman for Chaffetz, said the Congressman wants the issue decided by lawmakers, not a Justice Department lawyer. Asked whether the bill originated with Adelson's lobbyists, Henshaw said, ""like any issue that my boss takes on, he seeks the advice of industry folks."" Adelson and his wife and daughter contributed $15,600 to the Graham's campaign account last year, and a Sands PAC gave another $5,000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The senator's office did not respond to requests for comment, but Graham told NPR that his Baptist constituents and Adelson ""are one with this,"" and that, ""this is really easy politics for me back in South Carolina."" Chaffetz has not received contributions from Adelson, according to the Sunlight Foundation. Neither Las Vegas Sands nor the coalition responded to requests for interviews, but in January, the Sands' vice president for government relations, Andrew Abboud, told Nevada political reporter Jon Ralston that Adelson was ""prepared to mount full campaigns in every state where a bill is introduced,"" adding, ""we are going to make it 'the plague.' "" Adelson, 80, says he is morally opposed to the practice. He warns of a rash of underage gamblers betting in their living rooms and of the ease with which criminals and terrorists could rig games to launder money. In a recent interview with Politico Magazine, however, Adelson admitted that beyond the moral argument, he fears for his industry, warning that if online gambling is legalized, software giants like Google or Facebook will take over the market, ""and that's going to be the end of all of it."" Most of the rest of the casino industry disagrees, and the American Gaming Association, of which Sands is a member, announced in January that it was prepared to fight back. The group added new staff members and hired Jim Messina, who led President Obama's 2012 reelection campaign, to help with ""grassroots initiatives,"" including online gambling. The following month, the gaming association and other interests formed the Coalition for Consumer and Online Protection, which has hired former Reps. Michael Oxley and Mary Bono and launched a $250,000 ad campaign to block a federal ban. The coalition says it's a matter of states' rights, consumer protection, and Internet freedom. In February, Nevada Sen. Dean Heller said he is preparing a bill to legalize Internet poker but ban other types of online gambling--a move he and fellow Nevada Sen. Harry Reid have previously pushed--telling the Las Vegas Review-Journal that ""Adelson brings up some reasonable concerns."" Adelson and his wife have given $18,800 to Heller's campaigns since 2006, and other Sands employees have given another $27,550. Over the same period, the casino industry as a whole has given Heller nearly $640,000. The Adelsons have not contributed to Reid's campaigns since 1995, but he has received $423,022 from casinos since 2009, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. But the chances of passing such a federal bill will become more difficult as more states legalize their own systems of Internet gambling. To many, there's a sense of inevitability to online gambling. I. Nelson Rose, a gambling expert at Whittier Law School, said that politicians have become inured to the reservations they once had about gambling, as state after state has legalized casinos. ""Adding one more form, like Internet poker, is not a big deal now,"" he said. ""Every state has entrenched political operatives who have no problem with Internet gambling. As long as they're the ones to run it."" Ben Wieder contributed to this report. This story was published by The Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, independent investigative
