I've done these interviews about a dozen times over the past 20 years, for friends, neighbors, or former colleagues. An investigator shows up at your house and asks a lot of questions based on a questionnaire the friend has filled out. Afterward the friend under scrutiny will sometimes call, always worried about the same thing (besides the college pot smoking): What happens when he or she tells the truth about having seen a psychiatrist or taken antidepressants? The Defense Department is vigilant about mental instability for obvious reasons, and the Washington Navy Yard shooting is likely to make it more so. The central concern now is how shooter Aaron Alexis, who was discharged from the Navy and has a history of bizarre and paranoid behavior and two firearms-related arrests, could have held on to his ""secret"" clearance, which is a level below ""top secret."" Four U.S. senators have already called for an investigation into the clearance process. Surely the investigation will uncover gaps in the system and places where it could be tightened, especially when it comes to outside contractors. But it would be a shame if the end result was that people seeking a security clearance who have mental health issues become less likely to get the help they need because they don't want to leave evidence of seeking treatment that could bar them. A 2008 RAND survey asked service members why they don't seek mental health care. The survey was aimed at figuring out why more service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan don't get help, even though about a third are thought to have some kind of post-traumatic stress disorder, severe depression, or traumatic brain injury. One of the top five reasons was ""I could be denied a security clearance."" Another was ""it could harm my career,"" and a third was ""my co-workers would have less confidence in me if they found out."" The Army Central Clearance Facility has insisted that clearances are not often denied for mental health reasons. The official statistic is reassuring: an average of four cases per year, or less than one-quarter of 1 percent of cases. (The main reasons for denial are credit card or mortgage debt, which is thought to make someone to vulnerable to bribes.) But among military personnel, the stigma around getting mental health care lingers. (Think of Carrie Mathison on Homeland, sneaking her antipsychotics.) As Dr. S. Ward Casscells, assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, explained in a DOD memo on mental health, ""People are afraid they are going to lose friends. They're afraid they're gong to lose their chance at promotion. [Or that] if you show weakness will you be a good leader? Will people follow? Or will you be seen as someone who is out to just get a desk job?"" After the RAND survey, the DOD made an important change to the security clearance questionnaire to dispel the continuing stigma. Question 21 used to read: ""In the last 7 years, have you consulted with a mental health professional or consulted with another health care provider about a mental health condition?"" Now the question is surrounded by clarifications, caveats, and exceptions: Mental health counseling in and of itself is not a reason to revoke or deny a clearance. In the last 7 years, have you consulted with a health care professional regarding an emotional or mental health condition or were you hospitalized for such a condition? Answer ""No"" if the counseling was for any of the following reasons and was not court-ordered: 1) strictly marital, family, grief not related to violence by you; or
2) strictly related to adjustments form service in a military combat environment. If you answered ""Yes"", indicate who conducted the treatment and/or counseling, provide the following information, and sign the Authorization for Release of Medical Information Pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Alexis underwent a background check by the Office of Personnel Management in 2007. He got his secret clearance in 2008 when he was a Navy reservist, to last 10 years. It's unclear what he reported on his mental health then or whether he avoided being treated for fear he would be denied clearance. Either way, there are other places the process could have been tightened up in order to flag him--by looking at his Navy discharge records or police arrests. None of them require the DOD to dial back on its newly enlightened stance on mental health. As Marc Frey, a former senior adviser at the Department of Homeland Security told the Washington Post, ""Just because you're depressed doesn't mean you're going to sell secrets to the Iranians."""

1	1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/09/navy_yard_shootings_federal_employees_and_contractors_were_the_victims.html	This essay is reprinted with permission from John Feehery's blog, The Feehery Theory. Mark Leibovich wrote This Town, a memorable book about official Washington, its fancy parties, its self-absorbed culture, the incestuous nature of lobbyists, journalists, pundits, strategists, party planners, and socialites. But there's a whole other town out there, right under the nose of This Town, and you could see the face of that town in the obituaries of those who died on Monday. Twelve people were gunned down at the Naval Yard, and I can pretty much guarantee that nobody from This Town had ever met them. There are plenty of people in this other town in the Washington, D.C. metro area. Some serve at the Navy Yard, some at the Pentagon, some the Geospatial Agency, some at the Departments of Agriculture, Labor, Health and Human Services, and various other government agencies. The people for this other town commute in from distant places like Woodbridge and Waldorf, Rockville, or PG County. They take the Metro, or the VRE or the MARC, or they catch the bus, or they slug their way in. By slug, I mean they basically hitchhike (in an organized fashion, of course), by jumping in other people's cars at specific points on the highway, which allows the drivers to drive on the HOV lanes. It's an ingenious system, mostly done organically. That's what folks do in this other town to get into work. These folks work in the Federal government because it is good steady work and the benefits are pretty good, and they like what they do. Some are stirred by patriotism to serve their country in the military, while others like working in fields like health policy or with agriculture programs. Folks in this other town don't get to decide whether the government shuts down or not, although if they are deemed nonessential personnel, they don't work on those days that the government does shut down. Many of these people in this other town got hit hard with the sequester. Some had to take unpaid days off because they were furloughed, all because the Congress decided that cutting discretionary spending was far easier than cutting entitlement spending. Because so many of these folks in this other town live in the suburbs, and because many of the housing prices in those suburbs crashed so substantially, it would be pretty fair to say that they have a better understanding of what the rest of America has been going through than the denizens of This Town. The 12 who died in Monday's attack pretty much typified this other town. They ranged in ages from 46 to 73. They mostly liked what they did for a living. Only one lived in the District of Columbia. Most had pretty long commutes into work that morning. They were a racially diverse group and they did all kinds of different things to help make the Navy run. Some were contractors, others were civilian employees, some were still in the Navy. One of the victims had served as president of the local Rotary Club. Another coached the local girls Jaycees softball team. One was an immigrant from India who had lived the American dream. Some had already been marked by tragedy. One victim had a son who had been shot dead in the back years earlier. Another's house had burned down and had to start from scratch. None of them really thought that when they woke up that fateful Monday morning that it would be their last. They worked for the Navy, but they weren't on the front lines of whatever war we might be fighting at the moment. Official Washington, the folks from This Town, have already moved on to the next thing. To them, like the various other needless and senseless violent gun attacks that have befallen the country, this is just another example of how tragedy hits folks outside the bubble. To the folks in This Town, this might have happened almost anywhere else in America, but it happened surreally in their back yard, to people they didn't really know, but had probably run across in their daily travels. The folks in this other town, as exemplified by those who died on Monday, are not so different than people in the rest of the country. They live for their families and they are doing the best that they can to make it through every day. Some people like to rail against Washington and Washington bureaucrats, but those folks who live in this other town aren't getting rich at the expense of the taxpayers. They are trying to do their jobs the best they can, and they provide an essential role in the running of our federal government.

That is the trajectory of American elections, and it is getting worse. The rise of Twitter and other instantaneous forms of communication have made the news cycle shorter and its content less meaningful. Rising partisanship means more flash-point moments to excite the devoted but leave everyone else exhausted. Wait, maybe that's too dark. We're still a few years away from 2016. Perhaps we can forestall the great national wilting. Peter Hamby, the talented CNN political reporter, made a useful contribution to that effort. As a fellow for Harvard's Shorenstein Center, Hamby wrote a detailed assessment of the campaign trail reporting for the 2012 presidential race. The nearly 100-page report is full of candid thoughts from reporters and strategists about the state of journalism on the campaign bus--that bubble of reporters who encircle the candidate every day. It captures a general empty feeling in the trade that something needs fixing. Everyone falls short in Hamby's tale. Journalists are overstretched, their bosses have short attention spans, candidates and their staff are in a permanent defensive crouch. Twitter is the central villain, accelerating the worst instincts in political insulation. In the case of the Romney campaign, the reaction to the rise of Twitter was to become even more withdrawn from the press. Hamby doesn't just peddle despair though. At the end of his report, he suggests ways reporters can improve by moving away from the quick, calorie-free controversy of the moment and focusing on topics like the science of voter contact and the role of money and PACs. He also gives a shout-out to my colleague David Weigel, who doesn't fixate on the candidates as much as cover the political forces to which those candidates are reacting. I'd like to suggest another beat that deserves some attention: whether the candidates running have the skills required for the office they're trying so hard to win. This shouldn't be a novel idea, but the manager of the Clinique makeup counter at Macy's faces a more thorough examination of his skill set than our modern presidential candidate. The department store's applicants are asked how they would handle dozens of tricky situations--colleagues with drinking problems, managing unruly customers, interpreting complicated company policy. All the questions are aimed at discovering whether the applicant has the attributes necessary for the job. (Also unlike campaigns, applicants are told to say what they believe and not what they think the company wants to hear.) What would a presidential campaign look like if we tested candidates the same way? The first thing we'd have to do is figure out what skills a president actually needs. (I made a stab at this question last year in a series of articles.) Voters are already groping in this direction. As Washington grows more partisan, voters try to divine a candidate's effectiveness. Partisans want their purity dreams to become true while those in the middle want a president who can be effective in an environment where everyone has taken sides and won't budge. But while voters may know what they want, they're fuzzy on the skill set required. Dan Balz's wonderful book about the 2012 campaign, Collision 2012, has a great vignette about this imprecise longing. President Obama's strategists held several focus groups with voters who had voted for Obama in 2008 but weren't going to do so again. In session after session, voters mentioned Lyndon Johnson. Why couldn't Obama be more like LBJ? It wasn't just the older voters who had lived through the Johnson years who asked. Younger voters did, too. They knew Obama faced a partisan Congress and thought the economy had been wrecked by his predecessor, but they still expected him to overcome those obstacles by using the tools of the office Johnson had commanded. ""I've never had so many damned references to Lyndon Johnson in all my life,"" one campaign official told Balz. ""All the bloody time. It became like an inside joke, how many times LBJ is going to come up?"" Voters wanted President Obama to put on Lyndon Johnson's tights and cape to break the logjam in Washington. They didn't know how. They just imagined that all presidents had the same superpower, and it was just a matter of using it. Four years earlier, they had wanted the same effectiveness but lunged for a different solution. Barack Obama was only a one-term senator and had no experience actually running anything, but voters bought his argument that through the force of his personality and earnest bipartisanship, he could pick the Washington lock. They were wrong on both counts. The myth of LBJ the superhero forgets that he was successful during a special time in American history. It also ignores that ultimately he was stymied, too. Plus, Obama had been elected as a kind of anti-LBJ: transparent, conciliatory, and untarnished by Washington's backroom culture. It was unrealistic to think that he could become a completely different person, just as unrealistic as it was to think four years earlier that someone who had spent so little time in Washington and had such disdain for the political process could transform the entire operation. Unpacking the LBJ myth, what it says about what's possible in the presidency, where Obama falls short, and what voters want could keep a reporter busy for weeks. The next task would be to measure the crop of candidates against the requirements of the modern presidency. What in their background suggests they have any of the relevant skills? Have they ever managed a group larger than their campaign staff? Have they ever had to translate their ideas into action, build a coalition, and rally people to a goal? What do the people they have worked with most closely say about their temperament under pressure? When did they compromise in a meaningful way? When did they refuse to budge? How do they respond to failure? What mistakes have they made, and what did they learn from them? As Hamby explains, asking these kinds of questions was one of the useful things about riding on the campaign bus covering a candidate day to day in the old days. You endured listening to the same stump speeches because between them you had time to talk to the candidate and his staff to take the measure of the candidate. There is no precise formula for greatness, of course, but if nothing else, this exercise teases out who the candidates are and provides a framework for examining their candidacy. Candidates will hate these questions because they're complicated, but they can hardly duck them on the grounds that they are frivolous. They are the core issue. If they don't talk, their friends and colleagues will. If it turns out there aren't really answers to any of these questions in a candidate's background, it might tell us something about the weakness of our candidates. The usual suggestion for improving our campaigns is to focus on the issues. That's great, but any voter who wants to learn about the issues can read himself blind. (Voters usually don't, but that's their fault.) Sure, candidates should be more forthright about their plans, but in this past election, the policy choices were well-debated and aired. The question for the next set of candidates is not just what you believe and what you want to do, but what skills you have that suggest you will get any of that done. This probably sounds a little too dry to you. Fake exchanges of umbrage about the role of women in the workplace or seizing on a campaign aide's clumsy reference to an Etch A Sketch does make for better jokes. Far be it from me to rob us all of a good laugh. Still, no one can keep giggling all through the day and hope to keep their jobs. Or at least it's no basis for hiring the most powerful person in the world."	How to Save Presidential Campaign Coverage Before 2016	['Romney', 'Obama']	[]
3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/09/bill_ayers_obama_and_the_weather_underground_public_enemy_ayers_forthcoming.html	"A few months ago, as Nelson Mandela was ailing in a South African hospital, one NPR listener took issue with how the former president was being described. The network had called Mandela a mere ""civil rights leader."" A civil rights leader? What was Mandela, Al Sharpton? ""Mandela was a fierce freedom fighter and a loving revolutionary who led the forces that toppled apartheid,"" wrote the NPR listener. ""He was officially a 'terrorist' according to the U.S. government until long after the fight for freedom had been won. And as usual, those who opposed him and refused support when it would have counted, will invent a safe story of his life--one palatable to easy-listening Americans who want to be good, but not if it takes too much effort--and love that story to death."" The listener was Weather Underground founder-turned-professor Bill Ayers, who knows something about terrorists. It's been five years since Ayers' old friendship with Barack Obama caused problems for the candidate, and it's been even longer since Ayers had the bad luck to be quoted saying ""I don't regret setting bombs"" in the New York Times--on Sept. 11, 2001. And it's decades after the government's crooked surveillance ended its case against the Weather Underground, letting Ayers off ""free as a bird"" after a decade of placing bombs in government buildings. Next month Beacon Press will publish Public Enemy: Confessions of an American Dissident. It's billed as a sequel to Fugitive Days, Ayers' 2001 Weather Underground memoir, which at the time was the most ""self-indulgent and morally clueless"" memoir Slate's Tim Noah had ever read. (This was several years before Eat Pray Love.) I liked Fugitive Days a little more than that, and Ayers was kind enough to sign a copy for me after some of my college friends and I annoyed him at one of the 2001 readings. Fugitive Days and Ayers' post-9/11 book tour were streaked with humility. Ayers had done something wrong, and he admitted it, but he did it for the right cause. Public Enemy, by contrast, is a memoir of score-settling, against a cast of extremely stupid (according to Ayers) critics. To hear Ayers tell it, since 2001 he's been victimized and pilloried and misunderstood by a succession of idiots. This time around, Ayers is humble only in a short recap of the post-9/11 interviews and when he's reminding the reader that his wife and fellow Weatherman, Bernardine Dohrn, is completely amazing. In photos together, he looks like ""her chauffer."" In Public Enemy, Ayers sees a cynical campaign from reporters and right-wing bloggers to discredit him. ""There was nothing in Fugitive Days that I hadn't said out loud for thirty years,"" he writes, and yet his enemies kept trying to nail him. None of them had the clarity to put his past in the proper context. He was trying to stop a war, remember? ""I wondered where in all the noise there was any authentic call for a process of truth-telling about the war and the movement for peace and justice,"" he writes, reflecting on the 2001 outrage-spasms. ""Where was the proposal for an honest means to reconciliation and a sincere space of accountability[?]"" Ayers suffers fools and thought about literature. When George Stephanopoulos mentioned his name during the final 2008 Democratic primary debate, and Barack Obama denounced him, Ayers recalls that he ""thought for a moment about pitiable Gregor Samsa."" Before Andrew Breitbart, Tucker Carlson, and other right-wingers showed up for dinner at his house (a charity auction had gone spectacularly wrong, or maybe spectacularly right), Ayers recites some Rilke poetry to himself: Let everything happen to you
 beauty and terror
 just keep going
 no feeling is final Come on, how often do you get to meet an author this devoid of irony? Ayers did end up getting on with Breitbart, who died ""too young,"" but there's a difference between the haters who ""get"" him and the haters who don't. And sure, a lot of them didn't--especially in 2008, when the presidency seemed to be at stake if voters knew the truth, Ayers fended off a lot of people who didn't even have a Wikipedia knowledge of his past. There are people who insisted that Ayers wrote Obama's first memoir, and he finds this hilarious. He told one self-identified ""right-wing blogger"" that he'd split the royalties if she could help him prove her theory. ""I thought I'd brought a little ray of sunshine into what I imagined must be a slightly dim space."" He has sunshine to spare. Nothing all that bad happened to Ayers, not in this memoir. There were some canceled speeches, and yeah, there was a humiliating ban from Canada. (""I'd never once warranted a second look entering Beijing or Frankfurt, Cape Town or Cairo, Rio or Taipei."") There was the time that he was denied emeritus status at the University of Illinois at Chicago, but that ended well enough; Ayers' friends rallied to him, handed him a ""People's Emeritus Award,"" and showed up at his retirement party with buttons reading, ""I pal around with Bernardine and Bill."" He won. Of course he won. He got to see Obama give a victory speech in Grant Park--the ultimate proof of right-wing impotence. Just to be nice, in one of the many, many passages about his critics' failure to understand that they can't condemn him and condone military violence, he imagined the conditions for an ideal apology. It would be held in the Kennedy Center, or the Kodak Center, and it would bring government war criminals together with the mooks like him. ""Standing with Kissinger and McCain, McNamara and Kerry, Bush and Cheney, I'd be happy to say exactly what I did, take full responsibility, and bow deeply."" And then, back to freedom-fighting."

Turnout was light, on purpose: Just four men would speak to the media as stand-ins for the four men who were killed in a fog-of-war firefight around the Libyan city's American consulate. Just a few activists in Tea Party Patriots gear were on hand to watch as Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods, Sean Smith, and Chris Stevens were described and lauded by speakers such as former Rep. Allen West. ""I find it somewhat concerning that there was no moral obligation, there was no righteous indignation, displayed by our current president,"" says West. ""For the president to say this was a phony scandal--it wasn't phony for Glen Doherty. It wasn't phony for him when he ran to the sound of the guns while others ran to bed."" Not far away, the current administration was actually paying its own tribute to the fallen. Attorney General Eric Holder added the Benghazi heroes' names to a litany of ""those who were taken from us so suddenly"" since Sept. 11, 2001. President Obama mentioned Benghazi in his 9/11 remarks, too. That's not nearly enough for conservatives. For them, for almost a year, ""Benghazi"" has been a catch-all term for a disaster, a scandal, a ""cover-up"" (John McCain's term), and proof that the media will take Olympic-quality dives in order to defend President Obama. They want more than the multiple House committee hearings, put on by Rep. Darrell Issa, that have slowly advanced a story of whistle-blowers wanting more to be done that night to defend the consulate. They want a select committee to investigate what happened, something Speaker of the House John Boehner has dismissed but said he may be open to if ""we get to the point"" where it's needed. ""There's some truth out there that people don't want us to know about,"" West told me after the memorial. ""The simple question that has to be asked is: Why was Ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya, in the heart of radical Islamist territory, on 9/11, being guarded by Islamic militias? Is it true that we were running guns? The ambassador was meeting with a representative from Turkey. We know that Turkey is behind the Islamist forces [in Libya]. Were they talking about getting guns that we provided to the rebels there, who turned out to be al-Qaida, Muslim Brotherhood-backed, and then getting them up into Turkey to come down into Syria? Now today we have al-Qaida and the Muslim Brotherhood training Islamist fighters in Libya to go to Syria."" Most Benghazi conversations go like this--a solid question, then a torrent of speculation, growing out of a total lack of confidence in whoever's supposed to be investigating the events. Why are the investigators blowing it? Because the stakes are so high, and because these people always cover for each other. ""If this has something to do with gun-running from Libya to Syria"" said West, ""this could make Iran-Contra look like 'Romper Room.' "" Any liberal who rolls his eyes at the B-word should try to understand this. It was excruciating for them, in 2001 and 2002, to be accused of treason whenever they asked for a fuller story of 9/11. Asking what ""Bush knew,"" or making fun of him for ignoring memos about Bin Laden, didn't make them Truthers. The killers in Benghazi haven't been found. Getting furious about that doesn't make you a kook. But fury can be wasted, pretty easily. Wednesday's second Benghazi memorial was scheduled for noon or so on the west lawn of the Capitol, a stirring setting that pits the crowd against the dome. It got going late--there was confusion over whether some sort of ""Million Muslim March"" would arrive and interfere with the proceedings. As a stage and speakers were set up, protesters who'd come in for a few days (there was an anti-Obamacare rally on Tuesday) told me of their problems getting Congress to investigate Benghazi properly. ""When you call Boehner's office, they say you've got misinformation,"" said Elena Taormina, an Ohio activist making her first D.C. trip. ""Boehner says it's an administrative task and that's why it needs to be investigated through the people like Issa. But Issa doesn't have the security clearance. He's not getting all the information. Boehner has to put in an investigative committee that has clearance, but he's blocking it."" Why would he block it? John Molloy, who worked at 2 World Trade Center until 9/11 and now runs a group advocating for Gulf War syndrome victims and Vietnam POWs, joined our conversation to explain just how crooked Washington was. ""McCain was a traitor in the POW camp,"" he said. ""John Kerry knew it and had the files on it."" ""They're all being blackmailed,"" said Taormina. ""Boehner has so many skeletons in his closet and the administration knows it."" ""It's all choreographed,"" said Molloy. ""They don't ask the right questions. If Boehner had any guts, when he played golf with that idiot he'd smack him with the golf ball."" ""They don't want to be called racists,"" added Taormina. ""They've got no balls--they can't impeach the first black president."" Elsewhere in the crowd, which (pre-rally) was scattered around the shady parts of the lawn, there were versions of the same theory proffered by people holding signs that read ""Justice for the Benghazi Four"" and ""Four Dead in Benghazi--Not Phony!"" and ""Americans Don't Support Terrorist or Their Minions."" The last sign, complete with analog typo, portrayed Barack Obama feasting on the heart of Uncle Sam in front of a happy audience of demons. But the second sign stood out, especially after the small rally began, and speaker after speaker decried the president for calling the Benghazi outrage a ""phony scandal."" The president used the term ""phony scandal,"" sure--it isn't phony!--but Jay Carney specified that this was about the Republican focus on State Department talking points that had initially and wrongly suggested the attacks grew out of a protest. Speaker after speaker attacked Hillary Clinton for asking, ""What difference does it make?"" about Benghazi. That, too, was actually a reference to the talking points; the next words out of Clinton's mouth were ""it is our job to figure out what happened."" The speeches went on, under a sun that was cranking up the heat from ""painful"" to ""merciless."" The point, generally, was to get more members of Congress to sign onto the select committee plan, whose sponsor Rep. Frank Wolf now has close to 170 co-sponsors. Republican leaders are noticing, but they literally can't respond with the force that conservatives want them to--they just don't have the same information or theories as their base. Before heading back into the dome I talked to Bob Adams, who wore a home-made ""Remember Benghazi"" shirt and claimed that through his Revive America group he'd learned what his peers were up for. ""I've got a network of 250,000 people,"" said Adams. ""Here are the four issues they care about, not necessarily in this order: Benghazi, Syria, firing Boehner, and impeachment."""

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/09/barack_obama_s_national_address_on_syria_he_failed_to_give_a_skeptical_congress.html	"President Obama's address about his Syria policy felt like the policy itself at times. He went ahead with it just because he promised he would. The purpose of the East Room address was to rally the country and members of Congress to support a military strike against Syria, but the Congressional vote to do so has been postponed while a possible diplomatic solution is pursued. So the president's speech was like delivering a locker room speech after the rain delay had been called. But in keeping with the apparent rule that every aspect of this policy must have a contradiction, the president argued that the threat of military force must remain credible to keep diplomacy alive. Assad will give up chemical weapons only if he believes he'll receive Tomahawk missiles if he doesn't. But the only way that can be done at present--since Obama has made it clear he won't act without Congress--is with a Congressional vote supporting military strikes. But that vote has been postponed--at the president's request--while diplomacy is pursued. Because the president was almost certain to lose such a vote, not having Congress weigh in was the best way to keep the pressure on. The gas went out of the speech the same way the gas has gone out of the president's threat of force. Since Obama took the issue to Congress, he has been losing support. And yet in another contradiction, he was giving this speech from the greatest position of strength he's had in days. His threat to strike Syria--which was becoming less credible as each news cycle reported yet more opposition in Congress--was bearing limited fruit in the form of a tentative deal for Syria to give up its chemical weapons. If the point of the strikes was to degrade Assad's chemical weapons, what better way to do that than have him give them up entirely? Obama sounded the themes that have become thoroughly familiar since he turned to Congress more than a week ago as a partner in this endeavor. He reiterated that the mission would be limited, that the United States cannot be the world's policeman, and that this mission would not be like Iraq. He referred repeatedly to the letters from regular people who had expressed their concerns to him. He identified with those who opposed action by using their words. ""We cannot resolve someone else's civil war through force."" But the president needed to do more than assert familiar lines and identify with the audience. He needed to give members of Congress arguments to present their highly skeptical constituents. He didn't. Presidential speeches don't usually move votes, and this one affirmed that truth. That's not to say that the president didn't sound moving notes. He spoke of the victims and referred repeatedly to the children who had been gassed, at one point referring to them ""writhing in pain and going still on a cold hospital floor."" His request of the country was put most succinctly with those victims in mind too: ""When with modest effort and risk we can stop children from being gassed to death and thereby make our own children safer over the long run, I believe we should act."" Obama, who has been relentlessly criticized for not believing in American exceptionalism, then went on to invoke it as an argument for action. ""That's what makes America different. That's what makes us exceptional. With humility, but with resolve, let us never lose sight of that essential truth."" The emotionally charged rhetoric was a version of the case the administration has been making for days in private to lawmakers. It hasn't worked. Even those members who have visited the situation room and seen the gruesome pictures and video and listened to the president and vice president in one-on-one sessions have emerged unconvinced that military action is necessary in response to the atrocity. The biggest hurdle is the unknown consequences of action and the president can't really put those fears to bed. The best new argument the president has for his Syria policy is that the threat appears to be working. The outlines of the Syrian offer to give up chemical weapons will become clear soon enough and we'll all learn whether this pause was a bluff or a genuine breakthrough. If it's the latter, then what looked like a confusing speech in the middle of a fishtailing policy will mark the moment when Obama's hard line started to pay off. If it's just a bluff, then the president will again need that Congressional vote, and his remarks from tonight will be long in the distance."	Why Did President Obama Give This Speech Now?

This isn't an iron clad truth yet, but as the president faces enormous hurdles convincing Congress to support his action in Syria, it defines the fix he is in. At his press conference on Friday, the president explained that Syria's chemical weapons use was not enough of a direct threat to cause him to act without congressional approval. ""I put it before Congress because I could not honestly claim that the threat posed by Assad's use of chemical weapons on innocent civilians and women and children posed an imminent, direct threat to the United States."" By making that admission, the president highlighted the political problem he faces winning support for his mission. According to polls, the biggest fear people have about a U.S. strike on Syria is that it will lead to retaliation and wider war. There is no way to help people put away that fear. Repeating the words ""limited,"" ""targeted,"" and ""no boots on the ground"" is not working. For good reason: War is messy. If people aren't going to have their fears allayed, they're going to have to swallow hard and get over them. The most effective way for the president to make that happen is to convince people that they are in danger. They might be willing to endure the risks associated with hitting Syria if they thought inaction would put them at greater risk. But President Obama has conceded that the threat is not so immediate. Otherwise, he would have already acted. Since the president can't use the most powerful argument, he and his advisers are offering an amalgamated case--one part national security threat, one part emotional outrage at the indiscriminate gassing of children, a dash of fear over lost U.S. credibility, and a smidgen of patriotism. The problem is that every administration argument can be flipped on its head by reluctant lawmakers. When they are asked to consider how Iran will react if the United States doesn't act, they respond that they worry about Iran's retaliation if the United States does. What if the use of these weapons is not checked and they are used on America some day? OK, but what if an attack sparks their use on Americans? A failure to hold Assad accountable will show Iran that the United States is not serious about stopping its nuclear program. But a disastrous U.S. bombing mission in Syria will only further sap the U.S. public's will to act, making any future action against Iran harder to muster. Sunday night the president dropped in on the dinner Vice President Joe Biden was having with  a handful of senators to make the Syria case. He is also making a rare trip to the hill this week. Members of Congress will get private briefings from top officials. An administration aide said that minds will start changing once members of Congress sit across from someone like Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and receive the briefings in person. Perhaps, but will all of this attention help reluctant lawmakers with their constituents? They don't just need convincing, they need to be armed with arguments and explanations for those people who are lighting up their phones. When I told a staffer in Rep. Frank Wolf's office that the calls were 100-to-1 against striking Syria in another congressional office, the aide said, ""Here they are about 800-to-1."" The administration may be able to get lawmakers to yes, but can they get them to a yes that is durable enough for them to take back home. This is why the arguments whispered off the record or in the corridors of Congress would seem less powerful than normal. Democrats who are cajoled, vote for the mission or it will ruin the Obama presidency, a sentiment captured this morning by Politico, might feel political sympathy but it's not an argument lawmakers can replay to their constituents at the coffee shop. Many on the pro-action side are banking on pressure from the pro-Israel lobby, but to get lawmakers to overcome public pressure at home, AIPAC is going to have to apply even greater pressure. Are they going to make support of this strike a condition for their future support? Will they label a member of Congress who has been pro-Israel all along a false friend because of this vote? Those are the only kind of counterpressures that would seem necessary to match constituent reluctance. Or, are AIPAC officials going to make their case--in part because the White House asked for their support--but save their real pressure for the vote that will come some day on action against Iran. The president already starts with a political deficit. As Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report points out, Obama is less popular in general and has less public support in particular for this action than his predecessors had before previous military actions. Mostly voters are offering a primal ""no,"" but there are also at least 18 distinct public arguments against intervention he has to rebut. There are plenty of other private arguments as well. One foreign policy hawk trying to lobby for the attack said a member of Congress expressed support for the mission, but was likely to vote against it because he didn't trust the president to execute it properly. Another hurdle is that the military is privately conveying to lawmakers how reluctant they are. (Though it's hardly that private.) An official from George W. Bush's administration who supports action says Gen. Martin Dempsy, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared so reluctant during his congressional testimony that ""he looked like a hostage."" The most emotional case the administration can make is the moral one. The administration leaked new footage showing the carnage after the attack of Aug. 21. The president talked about the children gassed during his press conference Friday and United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power bolstered her case for intervention with a gut-wrenching story of a father agonizing over the loss of his two children: ""His girls had not yet been shrouded, they were still dressed in the pink shorts and leggings of little girls. The father lifted their lifeless bodies, cradled them, and cried out ""Wake up ... What would I do without you? ... How do I stand this pain?"" The appeals rest on a connection administration officials present as if it is a mathematical certainty. Given this atrocity, action must necessarily follow. That was White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough's argument on the Sunday shows. Time and again, McDonough said that members of Congress had not quibbled with the evidence that these weapons were used. If you don't quibble with X, then Y must follow. That's also the logic behind the administration's case that reluctance will melt once members see classified material showing Assad was responsible for the attack. But members of Congress don't appear to embrace the X leads to Y inevitability. Poll after poll shows that this is where the country is, too. The latest CNN/ORC International survey shows that 8 in 10 Americans believe that the Assad regime used chemical weapons, but 7 in 10 believe that it is not in America's national interest to get involved. (It's also true that most of the international community doesn't sign up for this math either, despite claims that this is an international norm--words the president should probably not use in his Tuesday night speech as it, almost by its very usage, feels disconnected from the idea of an immediate national security threat). Just because the president has downplayed the immediate national security threat that doesn't mean there is no such threat. ""If Congress wants to make sure that the Iranians, Hezbollah, and others understand that you cannot have greater operating space to pursue weapons of mass destruction like the nuclear program in Iran, then they have to vote yes for this resolution,"" said McDonough on Face the Nation. In recent days, administration officials have also been making a more direct link between Syria and American cities. An administration official made a case that went like this: If the United States doesn't respond, the prohibition against chemical weapons will get looser and that will lead to proliferation, which will lead to chemical weapons getting into the hands of terrorists who can use them here against U.S. citizens. McDonough argued on Meet the Press that the proliferation of such weapons would put U.S. troops in danger in future military conflicts. On the same program, David Axelrod put it in more stark terms. ""The problem is it's not our problem until it's our problem. So if you don't accept the moral argument, how about the practical argument that we live in a very small world now and if these weapons proliferate, that ultimately it washes up on our shores? We've seen that in a tragic way already. We need to contain this. And I think that is a fundamental point the president has to make."" Will the president go this far Tuesday night? The argument is a stretch, but you can see its appeal. It scares people, which might get them to support this mission. But it has the ring of threat inflation--something the American public has grown conditioned against after the Iraq war. Remember Condoleezza Rice talking about a mushroom cloud that might appear if Saddam Hussein were not stopped. President Obama is careful with his words. When he makes a case, he speaks of balancing competing pressures and acknowledges the honesty of the other side's view. He doesn't get emotional or go for the easy ploy. His language usually contains this kind of detachment: ""I want people to understand that gassing innocent people, delivering chemical weapons against children is not something we do. It's prohibited in active wars between countries. We certainly don't do it against kids. And we've got to stand up for that principle."" That's just another constraint on this president who faces a host of contradictions as he prepares to address the nation. No matter what room in the White House President Obama chooses to give his national address Tuesday night, it will be from within a box."

Ever since she became a surrogate for the Bush-Cheney 2004 campaign, Cheney seized every chance to slap Democrats on their limp wrists. Once, she criticized John Kerry for saying America had to get ""other nations to approve action before we take it to defend this country."" In 2007 she called Bashar al-Assad the leader of an ""outlaw regime."" When Cheney entered the 2014 primary for the Wyoming Senate seat currently occupied by avuncular Republican Mike Enzi, Washington Post uber-hawk Jennifer Rubin predicted that the candidate would join the Republicans ""who are concerned with the hollowing out of our military and the isolationist trend in the GOP and the country at large."" Ah, but to get to the Senate, Cheney has to win over living, breathing Republican voters. On Tuesday she told a gathering of the Jackson Hole Tea Party that she'd vote against a resolution to strike chemical weapons targets in Syria; the Obama administration had no plan, and, anyway, it should have acted earlier. ""The press will try to portray this Syria debate as a battle between wings of the Republican Party,"" she warned them. Touche, I guess, but how was that the media's fault? There's no measure of public opinion, no anecdote or graph,that finds Republicans ready to support airstrikes in Syria. The Pew poll finds Cheney's party narrowly opposed, by a 5-point margin. Members who've been holding meetings in their districts have reported zero enthusiasm for airstrikes. ""I didn't meet one person who was for going into Syria,"" Sen. Rand Paul said yesterday, describing his August travels in Kentucky. ""When I told them I was opposed to it, I got standing ovations."" This probably isn't the curtain call for neoconservatism or for Republican interventionism, however. On Wednesday interventionists led by John McCain got the resolution they wanted through the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, after their preferred amendment strengthened it. But they had to overcome a growing conservative consensus that intervention doesn't bring the results America wants. It's a delayed--long-delayed--hangover from the debacle in Iraq. The Obama administration has figured this out, as you can hear when Secretary of State John Kerry testifies before Congress. Whenever a member of Congress worries about strikes leading to a wider war, Kerry promises that they won't: A missile is just a missile. ""I think everybody understands that Iraq left a lot of folks reeling for some period of time,"" he told senators Tuesday. ""Secretary Hagel and I and many of you sitting on the dais remember Iraq in a special way because we were here for that vote. We voted. And so we are especially sensitive, Chuck and I, to never again asking any member of Congress to take a vote on faulty intelligence."" Republicans do their part by asking the sort of worst-case-scenario questions that were mostly blown off in 2002. Democrats, too. When they faced the House on Wednesday, Kerry and Hagel were grilled on how much they expected the intervention to cost, and Hagel suffered when he could only say there was a ""range"" in the ""tens of millions."" Florida Democratic Rep. Alan Grayson asked whether Hagel would rule out supplementary funds. Hagel couldn't. Kerry suggested that a more comprehensive effort to remake Syria would be backed, and presumably funded, by the Arab League. That didn't move the Republicans. Pennsylvania GOP Rep. Tom Marino, elected in 2010, told Kerry he ""didn't agree with"" the decision to invade Iraq and assured him that ""soldiers coming home limbless or in body bags is something for which I cannot vote."" Anyone looking forward from 2002 would find this party unrecognizable. Back then only six Republican members of the House, and zero in the Senate, opposed the authorization of force in Iraq. ""You still had the aftertaste of 9/11, and you had popular support for it,"" remembers former Virginia Rep. Tom Davis. ""Everyone's a little more war-weary after Iraq. America is out there by itself, basically--you had a coalition of the willing in 2002, and now it's just France and the U.S. going it alone. You've even got some of your right-wing organs coming out against this."" What you have is a return to the politics of 1999, when most Republicans opposed the Clinton administration's requests for intervention in Kosovo. Kerry harked back to that war after Marino pledged not to send any more troops to their graves. ""We had a 28-day campaign, there were 30,000 sorties, none of which is contemplated here, and there were zero casualties,"" said Kerry. That just didn't move Republicans at the time. ""I was one of a handful of Republicans who voted for Kosovo,"" remembers Davis. ""The reason I did is that I didn't want to undermine the president, and actually it worked out pretty well. You take that same rationale to Iraq, though, and you can get embarrassed."" There is support for Syria strikes coming from the right, but it's tempered. Max Boot, one of the more influential voices for post-9/11 empire-building, has endorsed the resolution with plenty of caveats about how Obama could botch it. ""Congressional skeptics have no choice but to hold their noses and vote 'aye,' "" he wrote in Commentary, ""all the while hoping that the administration's use of force will be less anemic than widely advertised."" National Review would only call the strikes better than the ""Obama policy of passivity,"" worth supporting in order to keep America credible. That's really the best the hawks can do--yes, intervene, but pause to reflect on how lousy Obama will handle it. They're joined by the clipped hawks like Cheney and like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who voted against the resolution in committee. Rubio had told the president to strike early; alas, ""unfortunately, the president, with the support of some voices in my own party, chose to let others lead instead,"" and made intervention pointless. It's just not clear whether these Republicans make up the majority. Not like they used to. The questions for Kerry, Hagel, and Martin Dempsey were informed by a decade of embarrassing Iraq setbacks. ""Where is the rest of the world in the response?"" asked Arizona Rep. Matt Salmon, who hadn't been in Congress for the 2002 vote. ""Why are we looking at a near go-it-along military mission?"" Texas Rep. Ted Poe asked whether Hagel had ""made contingency plans for us being in an escalated military conflict in the region."" Hagel said yes. This is how Republicans talk now. No surprises there. It's a surprise when a Republican actually defends the Iraq War. Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry baited Kerry by asking him whether certain poison gases could be called ""weapons of mass destruction."" Kerry said they could. ""Those two were found in Iraq, used in Iraq before I got there,"" said Perry, ""for those who say the past administration lied about WMD."" Kerry didn't bother responding. The hawks who still talk like that are getting too rare to worry about."	Is This the Same GOP That Pushed for the Iraq War?

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/09/obama_congress_and_syria_arguments_for_and_against_the_bombing_resolution.html	This piece has been updated since original publication to add to the list of members of Congress for and against Syria action. During the Cold War and for a period after the attacks of 9/11, a national security consensus existed between the two parties. When it came to foreign adventures, the president's party would support him, and a significant portion of the opposition (sometimes a majority) would go along, too. This consensus has been fraying. On issues from President Obama's use of drones, to the breadth of U.S. surveillance, to how to respond to the coup in Egypt, there is confusion, instability, and partisanship in Washington. This is why the Congressional debate over the president's decision to attack Syria is so fraught. The well-worn partisan splits don't tell us much. House Republican leaders John Boehner and Eric Cantor are supporting the president, but they're leaving it up to Obama to make the case to colleagues who don't like him and and many of whose constituents are against action. A recent Pew poll found 48 percent of voters, including 40 percent of Republicans oppose action. (Only 29 percent of the public favors action and only 35 percent of Republicans do.) Isolationist Republicans are aligned with Democratic doves in opposing the move. Republican hawks are aligning with Democrats anxious to support the president and who believe in using force for humanitarian ends. The consensus will only really be known after the vote and may not tell us much beyond the narrow limits of the minutely tailored congressional authorization. The attack is supposed to punish Bashar al-Assad without changing the balance of power in the ongoing civil war (like stopping a fugitive to give him a speeding ticket before letting the chase continue), which means members may tailor their reasons for voting in equally careful ways. As they do so, here is a preliminary typology of the distinct positions on intervention in Syria: Against:	There Are 18 Kinds of Syria Bombing Opponents in Congress, and 12 Kinds of Bombing Supporters	['Obama']	[]
9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/08/france_s_plan_of_attack_against_syria_should_fran_ois_hollande_join_barack.html	"""Punishment"" against the Damascus government, as French President Francois Hollande put it, would consist only of aerial strikes on military units that have used chemical weapons, according to a source in the French Cabinet. Chemical ammunition warehouses would be spared in order to avoid uncontrollable explosions. The militaries of potential coalition forces believe they know exactly where these warehouses are. Therefore, it's not a question of attacking Syria's entire army, as was done against Saddam Hussein's army in Iraq and Muammar Qaddafi's in Libya. Hollande made that clear in an interview in Le Monde. The idea is ""punishment,"" in the French president's words, or ""a shot across the bow,"" to use the American president's phrasing, in response to Bashar Al-Assad's use of chemical weapons, particularly on Aug. 21, which undoubtedly resulted in about 1,000 deaths. Western forces don't want to destroy Syrian airplanes, tanks, or command centers--destruction that would surely change power dynamics on the ground--they just want to send a reminder that chemical weapons are a ""red line"" for the international community. Military forces will be ready to strike by Saturday, Aug. 31, but the strikes will probably be postponed because of the British Parliament's having vetoed an intervention. The Labour Party said no to David Cameron to live down Tony Blair's participation in attacking Saddam Hussein alongside George W. Bush. The challenges and failures of the Iraq intervention cost Blair dearly, and Ed Miliband, the current Labour leader, clearly wants to rehabilitate his party's image in the eyes of a public very reluctant and skeptical of the benefits of this kind of operation in the Arab world. Foreign affairs minister Laurent Fabius spent lots of time on the telephone Thursday trying to convince Miliband to soften his position and to make only reasonable demands of the Cameron government in the Commons. If London doesn't go to Syria, Paris can go--or so Hollande says--but to intervene alone with Washington would be seen as the opposite of what's happening in Britain: the French government making a fool of both its own Parliament and the United Nations. And if America intervenes unilaterally, Europe will once again appear powerless and spineless. France should therefore take its time and find a legal basis for action. In other words, we must expand the consensus on a strike, propose a resolution to the U.N., and clearly show that it has made every effort to get it adopted. Experts who have been on missions to Syria must also very quickly appear before the Security Council to testify about what they've seen: Such testimony could be sufficient legal grounds. All this could take a week to 10 days. Translated from the French by L.V. Anderson and Cecile Dehesdin."	If France Attacks Syria, Here's How It Could Happen	[]	[]

Even George W. Bush agreed this was a good idea. Obama's predecessor said that phrase--along with his ""bring 'em on"" taunt to Iraqi insurgents--were among his greatest mistakes as president. ""I learned some lessons about expressing myself maybe in a little more sophisticated manner,"" said Bush. "" 'Wanted, dead or alive'--that kind of talk. I think in certain parts of the world it was misinterpreted."" The Die Hard-style talk made Bush sound like a cowboy who shot first and asked questions never. Obama was going to be the polar opposite. He didn't pop off.  He was measured in his mind, and his words would be, too. He told us as much in an early press conference. Ed Henry, then with CNN, wanted to know why the president was slow to get exercised about abuses at insurance giant AIG. The president snapped (by his standards): ""It took us a couple of days because I like to know what I'm talking about before I speak."" But on the eve of the U.S. attack on Syria, President Obama is hemmed in by his own rhetoric in a way that many, back in 2008, would have associated with Bush rather than the man who won the Nobel Peace Prize based mostly on the quality of his words rather than his accomplishments. As the president has weighed military action, talk of a moral response to the atrocity has been clouded by a discussion of how America's reputation would suffer if Obama did not act. A year ago, Obama said Syria's use of chemical weapons would cross a ""red line."" If you read his entire answer, Obama tries to dilute his comment almost immediately. He says his ""calculus"" and his ""equation"" would change, words that are meant to give him room to move. He didn't want to box himself into a military-only response. But when you use terms like ""red line,"" it tends to make people not listen to the rest of the sentence. That's why you use the term in the first place. Bashar al-Assad blew off the threat--many say repeatedly--and Obama did almost nothing. Now the Syrian regime has done it again. Obama must act or diminish American prestige, goes the thinking. Iran is watching, we are told. Allies are paying attention, too--wondering if the United States will keep its security commitments. If Obama doesn't follow up on his words in a sufficiently robust way, he might inadvertently embolden others. How credible will Obama's vow about blocking Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapon be if he gives Assad a pass? If preserving the power of words seems like a silly thing to ponder on the eve of war, it's worth remembering how much stock the Obama administration put in the power of the new president's words when he came to office. Then Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel argued that Obama's Cairo speech would ""go down as one of the most significant foreign policy speeches. ... It was equal to what Kennedy's speech was, what Reagan's speech was,"" he said. ""I think he did 20 years' worth of work ... for advancing America's interests. ... We are no longer the issue in that region of the world."" Given what has happened in that region of the world, Emanuel's comments not only seem naive about the Middle East, they seem naive about the power of words. Obama is obviously compelled by more than having his bluff called. Had Obama never uttered the phrase ""red line,"" he'd still be under public and personal moral pressure to act given the images of the attack. (Not to mention the private pressure from his U.N. ambassador Samantha Power.) Then again, those norms don't always force action. The United States did not respond when Saddam Hussein gassed the Kurds in 1988, even though, as Foreign Policy reported this week, the United States knew it was being done. But there's no doubt that Obama's rhetoric has increased the penalty for inaction. It's one thing to fall short of the standard for the U.S. role in the world, as some commentators define it. It's a bigger failing to fall short of your own assertions. This expression also exposed the president to the charge, made by my colleague William Dobson and Sen. John McCain, that his red-line comments became an invitation for Assad to do more because he knew that Obama wasn't serious. Despite what Obama said, what was conveyed through his actions and body language was that the red line was one that Obama didn't want to cross. The president's rhetoric has opened him to other complications. He said that Assad must go, without coming up with an answer for who might replace him (or doing anything to push him). And last week Obama seemed to suggest that lack of U.N. support was a barrier to legal military action, more words he'll have to walk back when he takes action without U.N. support. The danger of getting the language wrong is that it becomes shorthand for a more damning critique. If we're talking simply about language, the president's pickle can be chalked up to the inevitable tension in foreign affairs between what you can say in public and what you do behind the scenes (or are prepared to do in the future). But the disconnect between what Obama says and what he is prepared to do can also be linked to the larger claim that he does not perceive the underlying challenges of foreign policy clearly. He not only got the rhetoric wrong last August, goes the thinking, he misunderstood the conditions. Had he a clearer vision, he might have agreed with his advisers who pushed him to support the Syrian opposition more heavily last year. By acting earlier he might have removed the conditions that are forcing him to act now. Or, more realistically, the chances of a good outcome a year ago were no worse than a good outcome from the coming attack. The disconnect between what the president says and does, and how the world receives it is now playing out on the eve of U.S. military strikes. When the president justifies the attack, he will wrap it in talk of morality and international norms, but the words of resolve will be undermined by the reluctant walk-up to the moment. The true thrust of the operation was perhaps best captured in a blind quote in an Los Angeles Times story in which an official familiar with the coming operation categorized it as ""just muscular enough not to get mocked."" That certainly doesn't sound like anything you'd associate with the Bush administration. But it does sound like what someone might have said after Bill Clinton ordered a cruise missile attack on a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan in 1998.  In choosing the path forward in Syria, the president bounces between the legacies of the two presidents who went before him."	How Obama Cornered Himself on Syria	['Clinton', 'Obama']	[]

Ted Cruz's current crisis is going rather well. It's true, sure, that the arguments once used by dentist-attorneys and wealthy idiots to argue that Barack Obama couldn't be president--foreign father! hereditary foreign citizenship!--actually apply to Cruz. Yet look at the Texas senator's response to the story. The only reason anyone cares about his ""natural-born"" citizenship status is that Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution requires this from a president. Cruz could say that the birth certificate story doesn't matter, because it's August 2013 and he's not considering a 2016 presidential run. Instead, he's releasing his Canadian documents and renouncing his dual citizenship while joking about the whole mess. Any question of whether he imagines himself giving an inaugural address someday has been put to rest. Face it--we're discussing the 2016 election. We could complain about how this national addiction gets harder and harder to put off every cycle, or we could think ahead. Who's got the edge in the next few decades of presidential elections? To assess, I've relied on data from the United States Census Bureau, Pew, the EPA, the CBO, and the 2012 exit polls. More importantly, I've tapped into the Tesseract of election handicapping wisdom that informs most 2016 speculation--a ball of energy created in the mysterious sub-basement of the Gallup offices, guarded by robotic avatars of Stu Rothenberg and Larry Sabato. Thanks also to James Powell, whose Welles-ian future history 2084 filled in some of the terrifying gaps in my knowledge of climate change doomsaying. 2016: This one's easy. Hillary Clinton runs and manages not to blow the nomination to some Democratic upstart. (She's exponentially stronger than she was at this point in the 2008 cycle.) Republicans, who have proved unable to strategize rationally against the Clintons since at least 1992, get overconfident about their chances. Their conservative faction, convinced that the 2008 and 2012 elections were lost when they nominated two ""moderate"" and ""establishment"" picks, elevate Ted Cruz. The ""birther"" story is a help, not a hindrance; conservatives see it as a chance to portray Democrats as the Real Racists. (Recall how far Herman Cain got with this in 2011.) Cruz wins the Iowa caucuses, squeezes Sen. Rand Paul into a disappointing New Hampshire finish, and undercuts Sen. Marco Rubio in Florida. This allows him to defeat New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in a series of Midwestern primary showdowns, and to lock up the nomination in April. It's not much of a prize, though, as unemployment continues to fall and third-party groups pour hundreds of millions of dollars into ineffective anti-Clinton ads. A nation insufficiently outraged by the handling of the 2012 Benghazi attacks elects the Clinton ticket--an uptick from 39 percent to 42 percent of the white vote brings the Democrats to 355 electoral votes, adding Missouri, Arizona, and one Nebraska electoral vote to the 2012 Obama map. 2020: The Clinton Restoration ends in disaster. By the start of 2019, China's building boom has finally--later than predicted!--stalled out, with official economic growth cut in half. A worldwide recession ensues; the country most dependent on Chinese prosperity, after China itself, bears the worst of it. Chris Christie returns from exile, reshaped by gastric bypass surgery, years of macrobiotic diets, and the muscle-confusion workout developed by Paul Ryan after he left politics. Christie then mollifies conservatives by picking South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott as a running mate. It's tight--292 electoral votes--but the governor's able to snatch back a commanding lead with white voters and cut into the black vote. 2024: The Christie regime never had a chance. In 2021 a rump of Senate Democrats attempt to halt the repeal of Obamacare--yes, we are still arguing about that--mustering all 43 of their votes in filibuster after filibuster. They succeed. That's the cue for Majority Leader Ted Cruz to take the floor and deliver a passionate speech about the unconstitutionality of the filibuster--an ""affront to the men who broke ground on this shining city on a hill,"" or something like that. He proceeds to recite the Constitution and its amendments from memory, end the filibuster, and then begin two years of trench warfare during which the China-driven crisis hardly alleviates. Democrats easily win the Senate in the 2022 midterms; two years later, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and new Texas Sen. Julian Castro breeze into power. 2028: A long period of muddling through continues. Unemployment ticks down, slowly, while energy costs tick up a bit more quickly. A series of interventions in Southeast Asia, the old-new hotbed of Islamic terrorism, drains resources as the administration tries to cut back on defense spending. It does so in order to cut against the pain of entitlement cuts, which Booker approaches gingerly, angering the left wing of the party. By 2027 the far left has formed a third party; by 2028 it's positioned to throw the election to Gov. George P. Bush of Texas, the Republican who can cut back into the Hispanic vote, which now makes up 19 percent of the electorate. 2032: Years later, at a landmark conference held at Gazprom-Alibaba University in Cambridge, Mass., political scientists will agree on the date Bush was re-elected. That was Sept. 3, 2029, when Hurricane Doris made landfall in New York and New Jersey. The combination was toxic: seawalls unfinished after years of money being siphoned by Mayor Bill de Blasio's mandatory preschool program, sea levels driven 18 inches higher by thawing Arctic ice. Mid-Atlantic population centers from New York City on down are rendered partially uninhabitable, airports and rail lines unusable. The census of 2030, accordingly, finds the population moved south and west, the urban Democrats' strongholds wiped out, substantial refugee camps forming along the border of a welcoming Canada. That shift, added to a rally-round-the-flag effect after President Bush's tear-jerking crisis response, stymies a comeback attempt by former President Booker.

2036: Election postponed; brief intergalactic conflict with creatures from the Crab Nebula, who are eventually defeated by simple bacteria. Everyone's a bit ashamed of how long it took to think of that. 2037: The second Bush term leaves an acrid taste, worsened by the droughts in the Southwest. Swathes of the region, starting with Phoenix, are abandoned quickly; the population floods back north, repopulating a now-temperate Midwest. That sets the table for Illinois Gov. Malia Obama in 2040, and for an election fought over an essential, divisive, question: Should the United States stand with its brothers north of the border and seize the fertile farmlands and gas fields of Canada? Obama wins, and the war that follows finally restores some national pride."	Forget 2016. Who's Looking Good in 2040?	['Clinton', 'Cruz', 'Christie', 'Castro', 'Rubio', 'Booker', 'Paul', 'Obama']	[]

In 2010, Manning leaked hundreds of thousands of military documents, including 250,000 diplomatic cables and footage from a 2007 airstrike in Baghdad where American soldiers inadvertently killed two Reuters employees. Soon after WikiLeaks began publishing the classified materials, computer hacker Adrian Lamo identified Manning to the FBI as the culprit. While Manning was acquitted of aiding the enemy on July 30, he was found guilty of espionage and a bevy of other charges. Is Bradley Manning a hero or a traitor? Did he deserve to go to prison for the rest of his life? That's what respondents were asked in a snap poll conducted by Slate and SurveyMonkey about the Manning case. (The poll was conducted between August 1-2. Information on respondents is available here. More information about SurveyMonkey Audience is here.) When asked how long of a sentence Manning should serve, respondents were polarized. Most said Manning deserved a sentence of ""more than 20 years"" in prison--the longest option in the poll--which aligns with the sentence handed down by the judge. However, the next two most popular responses were between one and ten years, and 13 percent of respondents said Manning should not be sentenced to prison at all. Though split on what the judge's sentence should be, most respondents agreed that Manning was in the wrong. When asked if Manning should have disclosed the documents to WikiLeaks, 60 percent said no, 18 percent said yes, and 20 percent were unsure. Respondents had a similar reaction to a question asking how heroic Manning's actions were--57 percent  said he was ""not at all heroic"" versus 43 percent who said his actions were at least ""slightly"" heroic. But just because most people don't think Manning is a hero doesn't mean they think he's a traitor, either. In fact, respondents were almost evenly split among the five choices ranging from ""extremely traitorous"" to ""not at all traitorous."" Last, respondents were asked to put themselves in Manning's boots and answer whether they would leak thousands of military documents if they were in his position. Of the 413 respondents, 65 percent said they would be ""not at all likely"" to disclose the documents. Manning has said he leaked the documents in an effort to ""spark a domestic debate on the role of the military and our foreign policy in general as it relates to Iraq and Afghanistan."" He certainly succeeded in sparking a debate--about the U.S. government's retribution against those who leak classified information. But, as this poll shows, many people still value  the secrecy of military operations over the public's right to know about those operations."	Is Bradley Manning's Sentence Too Harsh or Just Right?

13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/08/republican_voter_id_initiatives_are_making_it_hard_to_rebrand_the_gop_as.html	"On Monday, North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory signed an omnibus voting standards bill into law. In a video message, he talked only about the voter ID portion of the law and assured citizens that only ""the extreme left"" opposed the law, for its usual crazy, extreme reasons. He neglected to mention that he'd just cut back on same-day registration and in-person early voting. Hours later the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People sued the governor, arguing that he and legislators had ""evidence that African-Americans used early voting, same-day voter registration, and out-of precinct voting at higher rates than white voters."" On Wednesday, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul spoke at the Louisville Forum and fielded a question about voter ID bills. ""The interesting thing about voting patterns now,"" offered Paul, ""is in this last election African-Americans voted at a higher percentage than whites in almost every one of the states that were under the special provisions of the federal government. So really, I don't think there is objective evidence that we're precluding African-Americans from voting any longer."" While Paul was speaking, the Republican National Committee announced a special 50th-anniversary commemoration of Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech. It would take place a few blocks from the Capitol, and feature the party's lone black member of Congress, state legislators from Oklahoma and Louisiana, the party's black committee members, and two once-rising black Republican stars who lost their last elections. Nobody said rebranding would be easy, but this is excruciating. National Republicans want to win black voters, and to let it be known that those voters are welcome on Team Reagan. ""Shaking black hands and kissing black babies would reassure nervous white voters that Republicans are not bigots,"" wrote the black conservative pundit Deroy Murdock this year. If only the Republicans who've won power in red states would go along with it. When the Supreme Court struck down Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, a trove of mostly Southern counties no longer had to clear their electoral laws and maps with the Justice Department. The result: voter ID laws freed from limbo in Mississippi and South Carolina, new bills passed in Texas and North Carolina, and denunciations from the NAACP. All this while the Republican National Committee continues to campaign in court against an old consent decree that prevents either party from launching ""ballot security"" programs without notice. ""Republicans have not always been savvy about making these arguments,"" says Artur Davis, a former Democratic congressman from Alabama who switched parties in 2012, campaigned for Mitt Romney, and backs voter ID laws. ""The voter ID movement has been damaged by extremists who argue that Obama somehow stole both elections, or clowns like the Pennsylvania legislator who bragged with no evidence to support the notion that a voter ID law would kill Democrats in Pennsylvania."" There's no question that the clowns hurt the cause. In theory, and in most polls, up to 80 percent of voters in any state back voter ID. In Pennsylvania, as the controversy over the state's rushed law mounted and the commonwealth fought off a lawsuit, support dipped to a bare majority. Worse, for Republicans: Anger over voter ID and restricted early-voting times galvanized black voters in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Florida. I saw it anecdotally in 2012, when I interviewed pastors getting ready to lead early-vote drives or stepped through swollen, mostly black lines of early voters in Ohio's cities. Florida's organizers called it ""Operation Lemonade"" (as in ""when life gives you lemons""), and they drove up black turnout when Republicans were sure it would teeter. The result? Rand Paul said it: Black turnout (66 percent) was higher than white turnout (64 percent), so there's no proof that votes are being suppressed, and no reason to fear that they might be. It's a little bit like taking Advil off the shelf because a widely predicted spate of headaches failed to occur, somehow. In the short term, the risks of a backlash look intense. In the long term, Republicans can probably live with that. In 2008 and 2012, sure, they pulled low-single-digit numbers with black voters, and they lowballed black turnout. Those elections happened to feature the first black nominee of a major party. In 2004, when the Democrats nominated a white ticket, their campaigners waved the bloody shirt of Bush v. Gore and reminded everyone of how black voters had been purged unfairly from the rolls. The blood didn't splatter on the GOP. In Florida the Bush vote among blacks jumped from 7 percent in 2000 to 13 percent in 2004. In Ohio, where Secretary of State Ken Blackwell became infamous for botched voter registration forms and long lines, Bush's share of the black vote nearly doubled from 9 percent to 16 percent. That was the ways of things, pre-Obama: A Republican candidate who'd expanded Medicare and showed up to talk to black pastors could make at least a small play for black voters. Bush's party, obviously, is a little different from the GOP of 2013. Today's black Republicans want the party to show their peers that they don't want to suppress votes. Louisiana state Sen. Elbert Guillory, a party-switcher who's speaking at the RNC's ""I Have a Dream"" event, says the party should come out in favor of restoring voting rights to former felons. ""There is no reason to disqualify individuals because they've gotten into difficulty,"" he says. ""They're still Americans, they're still citizens, they still have to pay taxes, they still get called to defend our nation in times of peril."" Artur Davis agrees with that. ""Republicans should be aligned with the movement to restore voting rights to nonviolent released felons as long as they are complying with conditions of supervised release,"" he says. ""No conservative ought to have a principled objection to an ex-felon being able to earn his way back into being a full-fledged citizen."" Maybe that'll come up as the GOP celebrates an anniversary that'll launch a thousand soft-focus features on racial togetherness. Or maybe former Rep. Allen West, who's also booked for the celebration, will insist again that black Democrats are trapped on a ""plantation"" of ""liberal social welfare policies and programs."" That's a winning message, too, depending on who gets to vote."	Republicans Care More About Voter Suppression Than Rebranding the Party	['Allen', 'Paul', 'Black', 'McCrory', 'Obama']	[]

Mitt Romney won the initial count of the nonbinding delegates by eight votes on Jan. 3, 2012. Two weeks later a new count that actually included every precinct gave the poll to Rick Santorum by 34 votes. Seven months after that, the forces of Ron Paul swarmed the contest that actually elected bound delegates for Tampa. The result: Twenty-two of Iowa's 28 delegates nominated Ron Paul for president from the convention floor. The ""liberty movement"" (that's the preferred catchall term in Iowa for Paul's followers) stuck around the state, and took over. Iowa GOP Chairman A.J. Spiker was a Ron Paul supporter. So were seven of the 18 current members of the state committee. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul leads narrowly in ridiculously early polls of the next caucuses. He leads in New Hampshire, too. The first two states on the nomination calendar happen to be bastions of Paul voters. No one has won both states and lost the party's nomination. These facts make Rand Paul even more of a force in Washington; they give the libertarian wing of the party heretofore unimagined clout. ""That foundation that exists within the party structure that was built around Ron Paul and libertarians is an advantage for Rand,"" said Rep. Steve King in a short interview at the weekend's Family Leadership Summit. ""Any other candidate would be glad to be in that position."" But how solid is that position? On Saturday I met Spiker, an affable 34-year-old real estate agent, at Fong's Pizza in downtown Des Moines, where he argued that the Paul movement's takeover of the Iowa GOP means less than advertised. It doesn't soften up the state for Rand Paul. Yes, he is chairman, and Ron Paul campaign veterans David Fischer and Drew Ivers are now the party co-chairman and the finance chairman. That just means Paul's forces are tied down with party bureaucracy. ""It actually makes it much harder for Rand,"" said Spiker. ""If you look at myself, Drew, and David, we were very active in the Iowa Campaign for Liberty."" He was referring to the group founded by Ron Paul in 2008 to build networks in the states. ""We organized grassroots efforts around Audit the Fed and other things that were beneficial for the movement. We're not doing that now. And look, if we were trying to benefit Rand, we wouldn't bring Ted Cruz in, like we're doing for the Reagan [fundraising] dinner in October."" Obviously, even if they wanted to, the Paul movement's allies in the state party couldn't use their positions to organize for him. At best, they prevent the ""establishment""--a word even Spiker uses--from trying to thwart a possible Rand Paul campaign. ""I wouldn't say the Paul movement is stronger because Liberty minded people are elected to the State Central Committee,"" Chad Steenhoek, a committee member who was endorsed by Ron Paul, emailed me. ""I would say that the [Republican Party of Iowa] will not use tactics to exclude them, which I believe the RINOs [Republicans In Name Only] in our state would do if they were in charge of the process."" Here's the problem: When it mattered, the RINOs were in charge. At the Republican National Convention, while the wider world was distracted by Clint Eastwood, the party tweaked the delegate selection process to prevent future insurgencies. Paul's people had overcome losses in the nonbinding precinct caucus polls of Iowa, Minnesota, and Maine by organizing and winning delegates when it counted, in little-noticed state conventions. The new RNC rules change all that. The popular vote from those widely covered, widely attended precinct caucuses will now determine delegate counts. In Iowa in 2012, that would have meant probably six delegates each for Romney and Santorum, and five for Paul. Not 22 for Paul. Or it might have meant every available delegate went to Santorum, because another new rule allows states that vote before April 1 to assign all their delegates to whomever wins the popular vote. Later this week, at the annual RNC meeting in Boston, Spiker will support an effort to change that latter ""winner take all rule."" He won't and can't change the delegate-binding rules. That closes off a strategy that Ron Paul mastered and reduces the odds that a few candidates might skip Iowa and leave some turf to Rand. And that turf isn't as solid as it looks either. Nationally, sure, Rand Paul's following in the GOP is stronger than his father's. He polls better among Republicans; candidates clamor for his endorsement; Mitch McConnell's tapped Paul family consigliere Jesse Benton to be his 2014 campaign manager. But Rand Paul's base in Iowa does not equal everyone who voted for his father plus. Ron Paul's base in Iowa welded together economic and anti-war libertarians with home-school activists and social conservatives. There's more competition for that vote now, thanks in part to the Paul family's success in spreading the gospel. ""The 22 percent that Ron Paul got here is more like a ceiling than a floor,"" said Steve Deace, a West Des Moines-based radio host, when we talked in his rec room plastered in Star Wars and Michigan sports memorabilia. ""Go back to the gay marriage decisions at the Supreme Court this year. The gaffe that he made praising Anthony Kennedy? That was a devastating gaffe. You're talking about praising a guy who essentially wrote an anti-Christian polemic disguised as a Supreme Court brief. I could have read that at Think-frickin'-Progress."" Outside of Iowa's conservative circles, Rand Paul's comment on the Prop 8 ruling didn't really read as a ""gaffe."" Kennedy, in striking down the Defense of Marriage Act, accused the Congress that passed it of merely trying to ""harm a politically unpopular group."" Paul reacted by praising Kennedy as someone ""who doesn't just want to be in front of opinion but wants government to keep up with opinion."" To a conservative like Deace, that read like Paul pivoting to a popular position--he's not as much opening a big Republican tent as setting up kiosks and selling different wares. ""The idea that you can build a coalition around you isn't true,"" he says. ""It's about where you are on the issues. The focus on personality comes later. That's what Reagan understood ... that's why Ted Cruz appeals to people."" Paul's allies do understand that. ""If Rand Paul runs and he counts on the entire Ron Paul group to vote automatically for him, it would be a mistake,"" wrote Steenhoek. ""He is unlikely to make that mistake. I believe he understands the 'Paul' coalition is Liberty minded, not personality minded."" It had better be, because the Paul family's last venture into Iowa ended in an ongoing scandal. State Sen. Kent Sorenson, who'd backed Michele Bachmann over Paul, dramatically switched sides at the close of the race. Bachmann, who apparently had been giving Sorenson a paid role, accused him of taking a payoff. Sorenson denied it. But Sorenson is under investigation, and the Iowa Republican, a Santorum-friendly blog, keeps leaking phone calls and emails obtained by the 2008 Paul campaign's former national field director, all of them suggesting that Sorenson expected money from his new boss. So far, even Paulworld's critics don't see the connection between Sorenson and the current leadership of the Iowa GOP. (Sorenson ignored a request for comment, as he's done basically since I saw him at the 2012 Iowa victory party for Paul and he said, ""I'm not doing any interviews."") The point is that the national Paul organization that got close to winning Iowa in 2012 can't just restart the clock if Rand Paul runs. His Iowa allies are now battle-scarred; his following is going to be courted by every other candidate who waves the Gadsden flag. ""I believe that Rand can benefit from the loyalty of his followers outside of the central committee,"" said Sen. Chuck Grassley in a Monday interview. ""They're in power because they outmaneuvered, in a fair way, people with other points of view. But they won't affect the outcome of the caucus any more than I will."""

15	15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/09/the_republican_party_obamacare_and_the_government_shutdown_the_gop_s_suicide.html	"During the periodic budget fits that have seized Washington for the last several years, President Obama and his team have made a consistent claim about negotiating with Republicans. No matter what the president tries, or whom he negotiates with, the White House can never make progress because congressional Republicans are controlled by a hard-right faction that refuses to compromise or accept anything less than total victory. According to Obama, that is what killed the famous ""grand bargain"" talks with House Speaker John Boehner in the summer of 2011, and it's what killed the so-called Supper Club negotiations on the budget this summer with Republican senators. Now the GOP is handing the president more evidence for his claim. Republicans, including staunch conservatives, admit that a small band of ultrapure conservatives have forced the larger congressional GOP membership into a witless act of blundering self-destruction. In the coming budget fight with the president, Republicans don't just risk the political damage of a temporary government shutdown, they risk validating the president's argument that the party is whipsawed by a reckless minority. Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. That's the way several Republican members of Congress and their aides characterized the political predicament they find themselves in today. President Obama has had a rough few weeks. His plans for Syria were sloppy and uncertain. He sought Congress's support--after his aides privately told members he wouldn't rope them into a decision--even while he told them there was no urgency and they could enjoy their Labor Day break. Then Larry Summers, his preferred nominee to lead the Federal Reserve, was undermined by Democrats and had to pull his name from consideration. The president got snippy about all the criticism, which invited a round of stories and columns about the sorry state of his presidency. House Republicans must feel sorry for the president--why else would they take pressure off his administration by staging their own party crackup? House Republican leaders, under threat from their most conservative members, have offered a plan to keep the government operating through December that is conditioned on defunding Obama's unpopular health care plan. The worry among a large group of Republicans is that the gambit will lead to a government shutdown, which will be a political disaster for the party, weaken their leverage in the budget fights, and upend the worthy goal of dismantling Obamacare. ""People are not going to blame the president for shutting down the government,"" says Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. ""The White House and Democrats have the upper hand here."" Johnson is no squish. He was elected in 2010 by running against Obamacare. He even spent millions of his own dollars to do it. Johnson is also hardly an Obama administration pal. He has had public confrontations with Hillary Clinton and John Kerry when they've come before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He's not alone in thinking the GOP is making a colossal mistake. Conservative Sens. Tom Coburn, Richard Burr, and Kelly Ayotte also think it is a foolhardy idea. In the fight for the soul of the Republican Party, this battle is on a different kind of ground. It's not a fight between establishment politicians and the grass roots; it's a fight between a slice of the grass roots and everyone else in the party. It is an extension of the conservative purity contest we have seen in the Wyoming Senate challenge where upstanding conservative Mike Enzi is being challenged by Liz Cheney on the grounds that he has not been a sufficiently pugilistic toward Democrats. These are fights that are less about ideology than tactics--though they bleed together quickly. Conservatives pushing to defund Obamacare argue that you aren't really that exercised about the president's plans if you're not willing to do whatever it takes to dismantle them. Not only do Republicans owe it to their constituents to keep up the fight, but this is their last chance. The insurance exchanges start signing people up on Oct. 1. After that, too many people will have signed up and the fight will be lost. Sen. Johnson and others argue that the upper chamber will not defund Obamacare because it is controlled by Democrats. This is an unavoidable fact that should have killed the gambit from the get-go. By forcing the issue, House Republicans waste time and court a shutdown. When that happens, they will get the blame, just as the party did after the 1995 government shutdown or perhaps even more so. Congress is less popular, and people are hurting more from the economy. What irks Obamacare opponents in the Senate who object to the House GOP's aggressive tactics is that they feel they were winning the Obamacare fight. The public is against it as much as they have ever been and will only be more so as it is implemented. As Karl Rove argues, that dynamic changes when voters are asked whether defunding Obamacare is worth risking even a temporary shutdown--particularly for Republican-leaning independents. By moving too fast, purists risk making all Obamacare opponents look like mindless partisans willing to risk the health of the economy. The Chamber of Commerce, a stalwart GOP ally, even asked congressional Republicans to stand down. There is more than just temporary pain at stake here. As the GOP's factions duke it out, Republicans are filling in the caricature of dysfunction the president has sketched for voters. Republicans are throwing around terms like ""suicide note"" to describe their own party's strategy. The Wall Street Journal editorial page calls it a ""kamikaze"" strategy. Sen. Bob Corker seemed to have no doubt that Sen. Ted Cruz was still backing this strategy when he made a not-so-veiled dig at Cruz, who attended Princeton and Harvard. ""I didn't go to Harvard or Princeton, but I can count--the defunding box canyon is a tactic that will fail and weaken our position."" (The term ""box canyon"" was most recently used in conservative circles to describe the hapless president.) This is not only an unpleasant airing of Republican differences, but it also suggests that it may be a lot harder for the GOP to come together to fight against Obama on the coming debt ceiling the longer this slugfest continues. Cruz is getting it from both sides. His Republican colleagues say his support of the defund adventure is about nothing but his presidential ambitions. In the House, though, his fellow travelers think he's chickening out. After the House's hardline conservatives put on their chin straps and signed on to this exciting play, Cruz issued a press release that seemed to suggest he wasn't going to do much to buck the reality that the Senate is controlled by Democrats. After all that time judging the manhood of other Republicans, Cruz wasn't going to mount a talking filibuster, camp outside Majority Leader Harry Reid's office, or do something to back up his House colleagues? ""House agrees to send #CR to Senate that defunds Obamacare. @SenTedCruz & @SenMikeLee refuse to fight. Wave white flag and surrender,"" tweeted Rep. Sean Duffy of Wisconsin. Republicans might appear to be able to quickly unlock themselves from this bind. Boehner could simply ignore the House's conservative crusaders, gather some Democratic support, and pass a funding measure that would avoid a shutdown. There are two reasons he won't do this. The first is that Boehner doesn't want to risk a revolt that might threaten his position as House speaker. The second reason may be more controlling. The minute Boehner allows Democrats to know he needs them to pass anything, he will start getting demands from them. Anything that would win Democratic votes would lose Republican votes--including Boehner's, because at bottom, the House speaker does want to shrink the government in a way that is fundamentally at odds with a near-majority of the Democratic conference. That is why Boehner and his GOP leaders are in such a fix. He's stuck pursuing a strategy he doesn't like but that represents the least bad option. That sure sounds familiar. That's the way people described Obama's anemic approach to military action in Syria two weeks ago. Boehner has backed a plan to shut down the government unless Obamacare is defunded, but he doesn't want the notion of a shutdown to enter anyone's mind. ""There should be no conversation about shutting the government down. That's not the goal here, our goal is to cut spending and to protect the American people from Obamacare,"" said Boehner on Wednesday. OK, but the only thing that is going to make that happen is the threat of the shutdown, but it's not much of a threat if you say it's the one thing you're trying to avoid. You can't play a game of chicken when you've pulled over to the side of the road. Where this goes from here is not clear. The Senate will not accept the House bill, so it will send a ""clean"" funding bill back to the House stripped of the Obamacare poison. In the most optimistic GOP view, the ""hello no"" caucus will learn that this was a bootless effort and they will sign on to whatever Boehner cooks up to keep the government doors open. Is this group of conservatives really going to change their mind? What will cause them to do so? The constituents back home who have been cheering their fight to defund Obamacare? The increased condescension that the New York Times editorialists use when describing them? A stock market plunge? If the loss doesn't get Boehner the votes he needs, he will then have no other choice but to turn to Democrats for votes to avoid a shutdown. That won't be pretty, because Democrats will exact a price against the backdrop of the ticking clock. (If you are counting at home, there are only 12 days until the government technically runs out of money). A government funding mechanism that passes with Democratic votes will excite some sharp comments from the very group that Boehner is having trouble satisfying. And this is just the scrimmage before the big game. Republicans will need to be unified before the debt limit fight in mid-to-late October. If the government shutdown is bad for the economy, the debt ceiling fight is catastrophic. In the debt limit fight, Boehner wants to push for a one-year pause on enforcing the Obamacare individual mandate, arguing that it's only fair given that Obama has frozen the portion of the bill that affects businesses with more than 50 employees.* But the president has said he won't negotiate on the debt limit at all. He isn't even picking up the phone. Why talk to Republicans when they are busy tearing themselves apart? Correction, Sept. 22, 2013: This article originally stated that Obama froze the portion of the bill that affected small businesses. That portion was to affect businesses with more than 50 employees."

16	16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/09/republican_plan_to_defund_obamacare_the_gop_s_strategy_is_make_believe.html	"If you're in a hurry, and you can only memorize one fact about the coming congressional debt and budget war, try this: There will be no ""defunding of Obamacare."" It's impossible for Republicans to admit it, great energy is being spent to prevent them from admitting it, and large sums of money are being raised and spent to stop conservatives from realizing it. If you want to skip to the end of this drama, past Friday's likely vote on the resolution that defunds Obamacare, the final page reads ""... and Obamacare survived."" To get to that ending, House Republicans--who really do want to shred the law--have to construct a series of hallucinations for their holdouts. They're very convincing hallucinations. The current plan, which Republican leaders were confident enough to endorse on camera today, is to pass a continuing resolution that funds the government at a shrunken, post-sequestration level, but ends funding for Obamacare--implementation, subsidies, etc.--permanently. And if that fails, Republicans are going to try to demand a one-year delay of Obamacare in a deal to raise the debt limit. It's a brilliant ruse. Until last week, Eric Cantor and other House GOP leaders had wanted to pass a funding bill that carved out Obamacare. This would have allowed members to say they'd voted against the funding, then blame the Senate for betraying them. The plan was condemned by conservative groups like Heritage Action, and by Sen. Ted Cruz, who'd just spent August stumping for the death of Obamacare, often at events sponsored by Heritage Action. ""Another symbolic vote against Obamacare is meaningless,"" said Cruz. ""Tell Pete Sessions and Eric Cantor to stop playing games with the lives of Americans,"" said RedState.com's Erick Erickson. Cantor relented right before Congress recessed for a long weekend instead of resolving the dispute. The new defunding plan was built from the blueprints of Cruz and Georgia Rep. Tom Graves, both Republicans who'd criticized the Cantor sellout. It was sold, successfully, at the conference's Wednesday meeting. ""The key to any leadership job is to listen,"" said House Speaker John Boehner after the doors opened. ""The conference was unifying around the proposal because we focused on keeping the government open and protecting the American people from Obamacare,"" said Graves after the meeting. From there, he logged on to a Heritage webcast to sell the plan to his base. ""People say it's a victory for conservatives or the right. It's actually a victory for America."" What's remarkable about this illusion is just how often it works. Defunding Obamacare through the continuing resolution isn't a new idea. It came up in the winter of 2011, when the new House Republican majority faced its first continuing resolution. Cantor said it would ""likely preclude any funding"" for Obamacare. Rep. Steve King pledged to ""block funding for its implementation and enforcement onto every appropriations bill or continuing resolution from this point forward."" The House ended up ""defunding"" Obamacare, and watching the Senate strike that part of the bill--but it was OK, because it would get another chance. Here's another old idea: getting conservative holdouts to back their preferred version of a bill, just in order to say that the House has passed something. That happened in June 2011, when Republican whips failed to line up votes for a compromise debt limit package because it didn't require spending caps or a balanced-budget amendment. Conservatives had demanded, and pledged to support, a debt limit hike that hinged on passing a strict balanced-budget amendment, one that would make tax hikes impossible. Leadership caved and let the party pass the hardline bill--which was, of course, ignored in the final debt deal, as the amendment went down like a soggy paper plane. The hard times continued into 2013. Up to now, the House Republicans' most embarrassing stumble seemed to be the failure of the farm bill, way back in June. Conservatives refused to back a compromise that would have funded food stamps; Democrats refused to provide enough votes for Republican leaders to pass the bill with defections. So the bill failed, and Republicans passed, with amusing fanfare, a farm bill that didn't fund food stamps at all, one that would be doomed in the Senate. Why does this keep happening? A large number of Republicans, who know that funding bills have to originate in the House, take this issue very seriously. Their constituents, and the pressure groups, promise to punish them if they don't defund what needs defunding. So they run up to the edge, and they pretend that Democrats may go along with their plans--maybe, if they try this a few more times. ""We'll see what the Senate does,"" said Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole, a loyal and talkative Boehner ally. ""Nobody can predict that. ... If the president and Democrats in the Senate have a road-to-Damascus moment, maybe we will."" This was a little risible, because we can predict with 100 percent certainty that President Obama will not accept the demolition of Obamacare. And we know that even vulnerable Senate Democrats have no interest in destroying the law. Most of them either voted for the law in 2009 or defended it on the campaign trail--what, like Republicans would go easy on them if they flip-flopped? The endorsement from Cole, who was perfectly ready to cave in and vote for the old Cantor plan, proves how illusory the whole plan is. The hardliners were making it impossible to proceed without another showdown, so voila --here's the showdown, which they'll lose. Maybe they can convince Americans that a government shutdown over a refusal to fund current law was really President Obama's fault. ""When it comes to a government shutdown,"" said the optimistic Florida Rep. Steve Southerland, ""it may depend on who is holding the ball at the end."" What if that football analogy turns out to be wrong? Well, the leadership can say it did all it could. Enough moderate Republicans will be willing to vote with a majority of Democrats for some ugly compromise. ""Ted Cruz and [Utah Sen.] Mike Lee have been asking for this fight,"" said Louisiana Rep. John Fleming, a reliable conservative. ""The conservative base has been asking for this fight. So we're gonna give 'em the fight."" They'll give it to them knowing that the fight is almost certainly impossible to win. That's not as humiliating as it sounds. As illusory as the ""defund"" campaign is, it's flashy enough to obscure the gains won by hardliners. Every Republican leaving the meeting today suggested that a compromise funding bill or a compromise debt limit hike would set spending at the levels set by sequestration. At his short press conference, Boehner agreed with that. Nebraska Rep. Lee Terry sounded as cynical as Cole about Obamacare, saying it was ""worth falling on your sword"" to stop it, not saying that doing so would work. He was much more confident, and more insistent, that the eventual deals would force Obama to approve the Keystone XL pipeline. These would be solid Republican wins, enabled--as far as the conservatives can tell--by the most hard-core members' willingness to humiliate their leadership. Republicans can see exactly how this plan will make that happen. They're not able to say how the plan will actually defund Obamacare. ""Our responsibility is to focus on the House,"" said Graves. ""The Senate's the Senate."" Fleming agreed with that, happily punting to his colleagues in the upper house. ""If they can deliver on the CR to defund,"" he said, ""hey, more power to 'em!"""

Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey, a member of the Obama administration tried to convince me that all was not lost. The post-Sandy Hook grasping for a bill, he said, was just the beginning of a process. If it failed, it failed. Advocates would be ready the next time that a gunman opened fire on a crowd. That theory was totally impolitic but widely shared. It was also deeply flawed. After Toomey's April effort failed, a spokesman helplessly suggested that there'd ""have to be a change in the atmosphere to yield a different outcome."" Tuesday, in a statement, Toomey declared that the Navy Yard shooting had failed to move anyone. ""The Senate spoke on this issue and we came up five votes short,"" he said. ""It is unclear if [this] tragedy changes the atmosphere sufficiently to yield a different outcome."" Spoiler: It doesn't! If anything was going to roil Congress enough to bring a gun control bill up for a vote, it would be something like a popular member of their ranks being shot in the head. That happened two and a half years ago. Sure, the Sandy Hook massacre scrambled gun control politics, ending years of detente between the NRA and scared Democrats. That led to new gun laws in four states, but looser gun laws in 18 other states, most of them allowing concealed-carry in places where it had been heretofore banned. And it led to the NRA-backed defeat of two Democratic state senators in Colorado, the only Western state that passed restrictions. Gun safety advocates aren't ready with an off-the-shelf bill. Not one that would have prevented the shooting spree at the Navy Yard, anyway. We know now that Aaron Alexis traveled to a Virginia gun shop on Saturday, and tested out an AR-15. He didn't buy the weapon; state law prohibits the sale of such guns to non-Virginians without additional documentation.* Alexis bought a shotgun, something state law permitted him (or anyone who passed a background check) to do without a permit. Nothing in the Manchin-Toomey bill would have affected this timeline. No one in 48 hours has proposed a law that would make it tougher to buy a shotgun. Forget that--it's nigh-official administration policy that people should buy shotguns if they want to ward off brigands. Gun rights activists know what they're doing. It took nanoseconds for conservatives to settle upon a theory for the Navy Yard killings: Aaron Alexis would have been stopped cold had Bill Clinton not restricted guns on military bases. Gun Owners of America, the group reporters call when the NRA won't answer, pushed that argument immediately. The Media Research Center found a man who claimed to have a son ""at Marine barracks, at the Navy Yard yesterday"" who bemoaned that they could have shot Alexis ""if [they] had the ammunition."" John Lott, the conservative author of More Guns, Less Crime, a ready pro-gun pundit when violence breaks out, has spent the last 48 hours asking questions like ""if [the] DC Navy Yard Shooter could get on a military base using someone else's ID, how could background checks have stopped him from buying a gun?"" We haven't heard much carping about ""violent video games"" yet, but like Sandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza, Aaron Alexis was fond of the hyper-realistic home console games that allow you to shoot holes through CGI people. Gun rights advocates, the NRA included, have a script, and it works, even when the other side is disengaged. The NRA's School Shield program, its much-derided response to Sandy Hook, is quietly succeeding at placing armed guards at schools and campuses. Gun safety advocates don't know what they're doing. The first post-Navy Yard cry for gun safety came from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who's written multiple, fruitless assault weapons bans. ""Congress must stop shirking its responsibility and resume a thoughtful debate on gun violence in this country,"" she said Monday. ""We must do more to stop this endless loss of life."" One day later, approached by Politico, Feinstein admitted that she was ""not optimistic right now"" and not pushing for a vote because ""I don't want another loss if that's the case."" Democrats can't credibly threaten to pass a bill. They can't even sound credible when they talk about the need for one. On MSNBC last night, recalled Colorado Sen. Angela Giron argued that ""you couldn't have any more armed people than were there"" at Navy Yard. That wasn't true. The newest political martyr of the gun safety cause had accidentally made the argument for letting people carry guns into more workplaces. The budget debate will consume all of Washington's time. The post-Sandy Hook gun control push came after a re-elected Barack Obama and Congress had punted debt and health care fights into the fall--i.e., to right now. The White House's legislative liaisons have spent weeks consumed with wrangling Syria votes and votes for Larry Summers, neither of which they ended up needing, and now they're pivoting to the continuing resolution that needs to pass this month. Democratic aides in the Senate put it like this: Who wants to reopen another highly divisive front in an unwinnable partisan war when they're already careening into two or three skirmishes? Almost nobody does. The ""maybe after the next shooting"" theory of gun safety always had some holes. *Correction, Sept. 20, 2013: This article originally stated that Aaron Alexis was prevented from buying an AR-15 because of a state law that prohibits the sale of such weapons to nonresidents. In fact, Virginia permits nonresidents to purchase AR-15s if they have sufficient documentation. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"

18	18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/09/crossfire_returns_to_cnn_the_new_debate_show_isn_t_bad.html	"The first episode of the relaunched Crossfire ran on Monday, a week ahead of schedule, with a discussion about Syria immediately pronounced ""awkward."" On Tuesday an important-looking crowd of Washingtonians crowded inside and around the Carnegie Library in downtown D.C. to fete the show, ordering drinks and trying to eavesdrop above the din of that night's episode--more about Syria, this time with the expertise of Rick Santorum. I found myself in a sort of receiving line for Newt Gingrich, the star of night one and the biggest name in the Crossfire team. Its other members are Obama/Kerry campaign veteran Stephanie Cutter, author and pundit S.E. Cupp, and onetime ""green jobs czar"" Van Jones--Gingrich is the only white guy on a series where that used to be a requirement for hosting. ""So many people wanted to be part of the new Crossfire,"" said CNN President Jeff Zucker from the party's stage. Gingrich still sounded surprised to be part of it. ""You thought it went well? Good!"" he said. ""It was a little bit challenging to do it on breaking news the first night."" It probably was, and--here comes the twist--it almost worked! Crossfire is not supposed to work. Eight years ago, when the old Crossfire was canceled, it felt like a ritual sacrifice to the gods of taste. The ax came down months after Jon Stewart effectively trolled then-host Tucker Carlson, begging him (and a bystanding Paul Begala) to ""stop hurting America"" with ""partisan hackery."" CNN's president at the time, Jonathan Klein, basically endorsed the Stewart theory. His network would concentrate on ""storytelling"" and step away from ""head-butting debate shows."" Maybe they were hurting America. Stewart's total victory turned him into the country's most powerful media critic, deriding the cable channels every week, counting Emmys every year. Given how much material he still culls from the cable shows, maybe Crossfire wasn't the problem. Fast-moving political news and punditry in general tend toward stupidity. When the old Crossfire failed, it failed because the ""classic"" format--30 minutes of debate on one subject--was mutilated into something more like the rest of cable TV. (Disclosure: I am a paid contributor to MSNBC.) The new Crossfire returns to a format that no one has seen, or pined for, in more than a decade. The darkened studio eschews the buttons and infographics of other shows. It evokes the unforgiving phantom zone where Michael Kinsley used to spar with John Sununu, putting nothing onscreen except a human head or a smaller head reacting to what he just heard. The focus on single subjects is like little else on cable, except for MSNBC's package of two-hour weekend shows hosted by the data-focused Steve Kornacki and Melissa Harris-Perry. Starting off with the Syria story might not have been ideal, but it succeeded in one sense--it utterly scrambled the right-left gimmick. The debut episode featured Sen. Rand Paul debating Sen. Bob Menendez, with the Republican making the case against intervention. ""We've seen priests beheaded by the Islamic rebels on the other side,"" said Paul. ""I don't suggest that we're going to be allies with al-Qaida,"" said Menendez. Decent and fitfully surprising TV, with lots of time for the guests to box each other in. There could have been more boxing from the hosts. Gingrich's odd skill as a TV pundit is well-known to anyone who endured the 2012 campaigns. He was at his best in debates--CNN-hosted debates, actually--where he worked off the cuff and flashed with anger. No one ever came up with a better slam on Mitt Romney's descriptions of himself than Gingrich did with ""pious baloney."" The 2013 Crossfire edition of Gingrich is more polite, but still delightfully high on himself. He's the host most likely to stumble into a hard break, trying to cram in one last point. ""I think that probably the Russians look at the vote count in the House and thought, 'Why wait until the Congress stops him?' "" he said Monday, puzzling out Vladimir Putin's role in Syria. On Thursday, already more comfortable in his role, Gingrich reacted to Putin's New York Times op-ed with a long riff on how risible the Russian president was. ""Putin is unworthy of being insulted by senators who wanted to vomit, congressmen who were insulted,"" he said. ""Look, Vladimir Putin is honestly and obviously a KGB operative. The idea that we would take his statements seriously? You can go through that document at every single stage and find out it's a lie. We don't need to respect his views; we don't need to respect his opinions, and frankly we should laugh at him."" Those are the ingredients for good TV. Nobody on the screen used it. Van Jones, that night's liberal, waved a piece of paper over Gingrich as if the former House speaker was an overheating boiler. That's Crossfire's problem so far, a mismatch of debating partners and too much of a lean toward friendliness. Jones, who spent months being pilloried by Glenn Beck as an angry communist, tries to emit nothing but sunshine and cute analogies. Obama's Syria strategy was ""a messy kitchen,"" he said Thursday, ""but the cake might be yummy!"" Later, when he tried to compare the president to Peyton Manning, guest and conservative foreign policy thinker Danielle Pletka laughed until Jones dropped the comparison. Cutter's got a different problem: She's the only member of the team still in campaign mode. To be fair, we've never seen her in any other mode. Cutter's celebrity was nurtured during the 2012 Obama campaign with a series of Web videos and TV hits, hard-won TV hits, TV hits that other advisers wanted so badly they talked to reporters about them. Cutter relies heavily on the TV tricks of laughing at the ridiculousness of what she just heard and pausing. At odd. Intervals to make. A point. The result, in the two Cutter-Gingrich shows aired so far, is that a conservative who sounds like he's invested in the topic is paired with a Democrat who just wants the president to win. On Wednesday's show Cutter repeatedly and ineffectively tried to wring some contrition out of Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn, the Republican seen as so HD-ready that the party let her lead the last debate on an abortion bill. On Crossfire, Blackburn's only job was to paint the president as confused. ""He's still wavering between military and diplomatic solutions,"" she said. ""Why can't you do both?"" asked Cutter. ""Where is your leadership moment on this?"" Blackburn ignored the questions, and called the president weak again. ""Bringing Assad to his knees and Russia to the table is acting weak?"" asked Cutter. ""That's not a strong act?"" Cutter's Obama-boosting is the part of the new Crossfire that most invokes the bad old Crossfire. S.E. Cupp, at 34 the youngest of the new hosts, is both the most natural and the best at using the one-subject format to ask new questions. On Tuesday, as Santorum made the now-familiar ""Obama's too weak"" case, Cupp asked him to ""help me understand how you square your conscience with not going in and ending a conflict where hundreds of thousands have died? How--how are you not concerned that this will become another Rwanda?"" She didn't get much of a chance to follow up, but I didn't hear many conservatives asked that question. It's so easy to root for Jon Stewart and hate Crossfire, but I view this reboot the way I view Internet news sites trying to fund ""longform"" journalism. OK, we admit that everyone's attention is ruined; let's see if we can remember how to think at length."

19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/09/michael_bloomberg_legacy_rejected_the_new_york_city_mayor_lost_in_new_york.html	"It's a rare thing to be completely politically repudiated across two time zones. The shame is typically reserved for presidents whose actual names appear on ballots for far-flung voters to reject. Mike Bloomberg, in his final three months as mayor of New York City, managed to be humiliated without any of the ego-boosters of a real campaign. In his city and in Colorado, voters have rejected the Acela rider/Thomas Friedman reader/Morning Joe watcher-friendly ethos of Bloombergism. First, New York. Anyone watching the polls could see that City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, a former frontrunner, was as doomed as the kid in the horror movie who uses a stranger's phone. Quinn had wanted to run four years earlier, when Bloomberg was supposedly term-limited. Bloomberg wanted the term limit scrapped, just for him; Quinn initially called that ""disgraceful."" Beset by weak poll numbers, likely to lose a 2009 Democratic race, Quinn reversed herself and pushed through an exception that would let the mayor run again. He did, facing a weaker Democrat--whom he nearly lost to anyway. Quinn never recovered. Until this summer, she led the Democratic primary, but her support was vaporous. As soon as Anthony Weiner entered the race, the narcissistic former congressman was immediately tied with her in polls. When he destroyed himself with an online flirting scandal--for the second time--New York City Public Advocate Bill de Blasio swooped in and started surging. De Blasio's campaign promised a clean break with the Bloomberg years, decrying income inequality, rejecting stop-and-frisk policing, and promising a special tax on the wealthy to pay for education. When I dropped into one of the final de Blasio rallies, I heard supporters chanting ""We are the 99 percent!"" during slow moments, and trying an Occupy-style ""mic check"" when one labor leader's megaphone crapped out. The center of gravity in New York politics was moving from Wall Street to Zucotti. Bloomberg was not pleased. In an interview with New York, he accused de Blasio of running a ""class-warfare and racist"" campaign--racist because of all the ads starring de Blasio's mixed-race and afro'd son Dante. He also finally kinda-sorta endorsed Quinn. ""Whether you are in favor of Chris Quinn becoming mayor or not, I will tell you this: She did a very good job for seven and a half years of keeping legislation that never should have made it to the floor, that would have been damaging to the city, from ever getting there,"" he said. ""And she deserves a lot of the credit for what's gone on in the city in the last seven and a half years."" Democrats, if they were still paying attention to Bloomberg, were never going to be swayed by this. Last night Quinn placed third in the primary, with 15.5 percent of the vote and no hope of making a (still uncertain) runoff. The next mayor of New York will probably be a Democrat who told an adviser that ""it would be phony of me to be anything but a critic"" of Bloomberg. That was just in Bloomberg's city. In Colorado, a tough year for the mayor's gun-control campaign continued with the defeat of two Democratic state senators--one of them the president of the upper house there. Both had voted for the state's package of new gun laws that passed in the wake of the Sandy Hook and Aurora shootings. Conservative activists reacted by gathering signatures to recall Sen. John Morse and Sen. Angela Giron. Until yesterday, no Colorado state senators had ever been recalled. Bloomberg tried to prevent that. His specter hovered over the races from the beginning, with conservatives warning that the easily caricatured New York mayor was going to try to buy them. He finally did so at the end of August, with $350,000 to the anti-recall front group Taxpayers for Responsible Democracy, just $10,000 less than the NRA. (In Colorado, as in Wisconsin and California, anti-recall campaigners led with the argument that no one should be recalled simply for voting in a way people didn't like.) Both sides now weighed in on Bloomberg. ""For Mayors Against Illegal Guns, if they lose even one of these seats, they might as well fold it up,"" said Giron, referring to Bloomberg's group. ""They understand that."" Recall spokeswoman Jennifer Kerns crowed that her side ""represent[ed] the folks who live here, work here, and simply want their state back from the East Coast special interests like Mayor Bloomberg."" That easy Manhattan-bashing won out, and the recall campaign notched 51 percent of the vote against Morse and 56 percent against Giron. Mayors Against Illegal Guns responded to the losses with maximum incoherence. ""Win, lose, or draw, this will send a message to legislators who take risks to protect their community,"" said MAIG's Mark Glaze. ""We will have their back, and eventually, the tide will turn."" Eventually? Here in our timeline, money from the NRA and the Koch family's Americans for Prosperity (which also backed the recall) caused no problem for conservatives while Bloomberg's money tainted the Democrats. That's just the latest problem for MAIG, which has been losing dozens of mayors from mid-sized towns and cities as its focus has turned to gun-control bills. ""They're not just against illegal guns,"" said disgruntled Sioux City, Iowa mayor Bob Scott. ""They're against all guns."" The New York election was a repudiation of Mayor Bloomberg. The Colorado election is worse--a defeat for Bloomberg the Icon. For half a decade or more, a certain sort of liberal, usually well-off, has convinced himself that the country he dreams of is possible, if only Bloomberg wills it. Bloomberg seemed to believe this too; his guru Kevin Sheekey interpreted polls about how many voters said the country was ""off track"" and demanded a third-party candidate to right it. After a bad Acela ride in 2012, Thomas Friedman asked Bloomberg to run for president and ""challenge, and maybe even improve, both major-party presidential candidates by speaking honestly about what is needed to restore the foundations of America's global leadership before we implode."" The people who believed that on Monday probably still believe it. A couple of election losses aside, in a few months Bloomberg will be a private citizen with billions to spend on his political causes. That's enough time to rethink this theory that you can ignore all critics, drop money from a helicopter, and expect to be forever proven right."	The Bloomberg Blowback Has Begun	[]	['guns']
20	20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/09/republicans_favor_vladimir_putin_s_negotiated_deal_congress_has_a_new_faith.html	"They walked in good cheer from Union Station to the parks across from Capitol Hill--the proud supporters of Bashar al-Assad. They wore T-shirts with the Syrian president's cheery face emblazoned on the national flag and wore T-shirts that read, ""Hands Off Syria,"" complete with bloody handprints. Minerva Sabbagh, a priest's wife who'd ridden one of six buses down from Allentown, Penn., wore a homemade number with the powerful-if-dubious slogan ""Jesus Was Syrian."" Her message, like everyone else's, was that Washington needed to prop up the dictator who could protect Syria's Christians. ""He's standing for Syria, just like Obama is standing for America,"" said Sabbagh. ""He's an Allawite! He even goes to the monasteries and prays!"" Sabbagh contrasted Assad's behavior--being a good husband, being falsely accused of chemical weapons attacks--with the assaults of the Syrian rebels. Why, she asked, did Americans want to side with them? ""Animals don't do what they do,"" she said. ""They're opening the chests, beheading, torturing like they did 2,000 years ago."" The presence of a reporter in the midst of this rally stirred up the protest. One man, wearing a shirt that portrayed Christ and the crown of thorns with black and orange beads, insisted to me that ""it's all over for the Christians"" if Assad were to fall. Another with a sign reading, ""We Support the Syrian Military Fighting Al Qaeda,"" held it up straight for a photo. When Sabbagh choked up, her daughter Hope helpfully provided fresh spin. ""The fall of the Byzantine empire is going to happen again,"" she said, ""but it's going to happen in America."" These were not people or opinions getting a ton of purchase in the mainstream media. They had a more important audience: Congress. The tide of realpolitik washing over the Capitol has Republicans decrying the Syrian rebels' threat to Christians. It has both parties talking hopefully about a deal with the Russians that would remove the regime's chemical weapons but do nothing else to upset the balance in the country. The first argument, the ""think of the Christians"" spiel, has been gathering force on the right for weeks. Sen. Rand Paul, the most reliable noninterventionist in the GOP, has used nearly every public appearance to emphasize that Christians were safe under the Assad regime but threatened if the radical faction of the Syrian resistance won out. ""The one thing you might say if you wanted to say something good [about Assad] is that there was some civility there for a generation or more,"" he said last week. ""You see what happens when the radical Islamists take over, the Muslim Brotherhood raging through Coptic neighborhoods in Egypt."" Ten years ago, plenty of Republicans (though not Paul's father) were fooled into thinking that Saddam Hussein's secular dictatorship was actually in league with al-Qaida. They've since learned to appreciate the iron boot heel of the Arab secularist. Last week, a pack of conservative House Republicans traveled the Arab world and met with the new-old military government in Egypt. They left singing the praises of that regime, and warning Americans of backing any rebels who might be less friendly to Christians and more friendly to al-Qaida. ""We remember who caused 9/11 in America,"" said Rep. Michele Bachmann while in Cairo. Maybe it's easy to dismiss Bachmann, but as members filed into Monday's private briefing on Syria with Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, a few conservatives agreed with her. ""Having met with some of our allies in the Middle East, privately they want to know: Do you guys understand you were fighting the Muslim Brotherhood in Afghanistan and these other places?"" said Rep. Louie Gohmert, who was on the trip. ""Now, you've turned on a guy that was a U.S. ally, Mubarak. You turned on a guy, Qaddafi, that since 2003 had been an ally. You turned on the Northern Alliance that really defeated the Taliban initially. Are you gonna turn on us next?"" No Republican, really, could promise that intervention in Syria wouldn't backfire and help al-Qaida. Rep. Peter King, possibly the most reliable hawk in the party, suggested only that ""both sides"" would benefit if chemical weapons were neutralized. More skeptical members say that the briefings are full of questions about whether intervention might boost Islamists, and haven't produced good answers. ""Increasingly the opposition that are al-Qaida types are going after the Christians,"" said Rep. Christopher Smith, a New Jersey conservative who wants to set up a war crimes tribunal for Syria. ""It's increasingly a case of genocide, not collateral damage. It's a very dangerous jihad."" And how do members of Congress hope to prevent that? Realism. ""I think we need to re-triple our efforts diplomatically,"" said Smith--and like a lot of Republicans on Monday, he wondered if a new proposal from Russia might do the trick. Russia's offer to allow Syria to transfer control of its chemical weapons to the international community, something that might have been cackled out of the room a few months ago, found plenty of buyers in Congress. ""The potential for a negotiated settlement here--it's attractive for reasons that are very obvious,"" said Virginia Rep. Scott Rigell. The Russian settlement was preferable to any airstrikes, ""provided that the objectives that have been articulated, that the international community gains control of the weapons and ultimately they're destroyed, this is a shared objective. I can't imagine why one would object to that."" In the past, hawks--largely Republicans--might have objected because they didn't trust the Russians, or trust the ""international community."" It was only 10 years ago that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was dismissing Western European nations that declined to support the war in Iraq as ""old Europe,"" and the New York Post was labeling France and Germany as part of the ""Axis of Weasels"" for preferring weapons inspections to war in Iraq. Before neoconservatives despised that ""axis,"" they'd despised Henry Kissinger and detente with the Soviet Union, amending trade bills to add human rights conditions for Russian Jews. But realpolitik is back. Members of Congress are more outwardly concerned about Syrian Christians than they are about AIPAC's endorsement of airstrikes. They're tentatively endorsing a Russian plan that may or may not be sincere. ""We did a lot of things with the Soviets,"" suggested Rep. Darrell Issa after leaving the closed-door briefing on Monday. ""We did a great many things during the Cold War that were positive, including work on nonproliferation. My statement earlier that Putin was part of a smaller but still evil empire that opposes the United States, that blocks it, that has backed Iran, that continues to support Syria for purposes that are not good--I stand by that. But if Russians in this case could get weapons out of the hands of both parties, that's something we should work on."" A reporter who'd talked to Issa before about Russia remarked that he'd completely changed his tone. Issa swiveled to find her, looking away from the TV cameras that had been capturing his wisdom. ""He's still an evil man from an evil empire!"" Issa assured the reporter. He turned back to the cameras. ""If in fact Putin can, for the sake of his sponsored nation--if he can get weapons out of the hands of Assad, for positions that are in his best interest, then we should work with him. The Russians may not be able to deliver the elimination of chemical weapons, but neither can this military strike."""	How Congress Learned to Love Vladimir Putin	['Issa', 'Rigell', 'Obama']	[]

Here again--finally!--are current capsule histories of the 435 congressional districts and 50 states. Here in one place are enough factoids to make any hack seem like an expert on a congressman he's only just heard of before going on TV to discuss him. (""Well, Sean, the congressman is an Iraq War veteran who voted for the debt limit deal ... "") Here is a useful primer on Northern Mariana Islands Del. Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan and his quest to make the census count his islands' population properly. Here, too, is helpful proof that we're going to be stuck with this Congress for at least eight years. The new almanac calculates the Obama-Romney and Obama-McCain shares of the vote in every district, information that had been aggregated online but not in a particularly user-friendly way. Flip back and forth between this book and the 2012 edition, which contains the old Obama-McCain margins before the gerrymanders, and you see how the gerrymanders of 2010 have taken most of the country out of play. Look! There's Ohio's 6th, morphed from a district McCain won by 8,004 votes to one he took by 40,084 votes. There's Maryland's 6th, an old Republican district (McCain by 61,231 votes) molded for Democrats (Obama by 44,696 votes). There's one of the most devious gerrymanders in the country, North Carolina's 8th, drawn by the GOP class of 2010 to shove out Democratic counties. The old 8th had gone for Obama in 2008 by 16,100 votes. The new one went for McCain by 46,772. It's no surprise that Democrat Larry Kissell lost it. Back in 2012 Republicans mocked the doomed Kissell for skipping the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte; it felt a bit like mocking the kid in the body cast for coming in last in a footrace. This is ""old news,"" I suppose, but the map allows anyone who pays glancing attention to predict nine out of 10 votes in the House. You have a conservative GOP that owes nothing to swing votes; you have a liberal Democratic Party that can say the same. In his introduction to the Almanac, Michael Barone argues that ""clustering"" of ""Democratic core constituencies like blacks, Hispanics, and gentry liberals"" means that the party's simply going to be packed into fewer districts. In 2004 George W. Bush won 51 percent of the vote and 255 congressional districts; in 2012 Obama did just as well with the popular vote but won 209 districts. How does that skew our parties? Well, that's obvious, if easier to remember during a debt fight than during some black swan campaign to bomb Syria. How new is this, voters going straight down the ticket and electing presidents and congressmen of the same party? Quite new, and best explained by thumbing through an older Almanac. So I picked the 1990 edition, which appeared after George H.W. Bush's midterms and predated the first round of redistricting that attempted to maximize the number of majority-minority seats. Its version of Congress is completely unrecognizable. In 2012 only 17 Republicans won elections in districts carried by Obama-Biden. In 1988, in 137 districts--not even counting the states that have single, at-large districts--voters chose George H.W. Bush for president but chose a Democrat for Congress. This was most visible in the South, where voters were incredibly slow to reject the white, conservative Democrats of their forefathers. They backed forgotten statesmen like Georgia Rep. Ed Jenkins, who ran 36 points ahead of Michael Dukakis to win his seat, and South Carolina Rep. Liz Patterson, who won her first race by 4 points in a district Dukakis lost by 34 points. But before 1992, much of the country looked like this. In Illinois, George H.W. Bush beat Michael Dukakis by a slim 51-49 margin, separated by fewer than 100,000 votes. He routed Dukakis in 14 of the state's 22 districts. How many Republicans did Illinois send to Congress? Just seven. Half of the Bush districts elected Democrats, most of them by landslides. Democratic Rep. Marty Russo, in the 3rd District, ran 30 points ahead of Dukakis. Future Sen. Dick Durbin won the 20th District by running 17 points ahead of Dukakis. Six years later, of course, Republicans managed to fix this. Southern and rural whites realized that they were angrier at Hillary Clinton than at Abraham Lincoln. They won their first congressional majority since the Eisenhower years, and they won it with reliable conservatives. In 2006 Democrats reversed this by duct-taping their remaining Southern moderates and ""Blue Dogs"" to suburban Democrats who could take advantage of the Iraq War backlash. The 2012 election, dreadful as we all remember it, was more definitive than any of these races. It gave use a more Republican House than the voters expected, thanks to the gerrymander, but it gave us coherent parties. There are no Republican representatives from New England; there are only five white Democratic congressmen* from the Deep South (excepting Florida). There are no pro-Obamacare Republicans, and at the national level, no pro-life Democrats who buck the party when it counts. So it's true: Gerrymandering isn't the only reason the GOP held the House. Gerrymandering only worked because voters stopped splitting their ballots. Voters have a terrific and true understanding of what policies they'll get if they vote D or R, and no longer will they settle for the Lincoln-bashing Democrat who keeps the military base open. Someone as flawed as Mark Sanford can walk up to South Carolina voters, remind them that Nancy Pelosi exists, and beat the capable Democrat he's running against. You can pine for that old era of split ballots and heterodox parties, if you like. The new era's a lot more honest--and with helpful color coding! *Georgia Rep. John Barrow, Tennessee Rep. Steve Cohen, Tennessee Rep. Jim Cooper, North Carolina Rep. Mike McIntyre, and North Carolina Rep. David Price. Three of these men, in 2013, voted against Nancy Pelosi for speaker--Barrow, Cooper, and McIntyre.** **Correction, Sept. 6, 2013: This post orginally misidentified North Carolina Rep.

As Sen. John McCain proved, you can even sit through them and play online poker. So it was unusual and exciting to hear Kerry say Tuesday during his testimony in front of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations that he could not promise with metaphysical certitude that ground troops would not be needed in Syria. """"I don't want to take off the table an option that might or might not be available to a president of the United States to secure our country,"" A few minutes later, though, Kerry tried to reverse himself, not only clearing the table but trying to seal the room. ""Let's shut that door now,"" to ground troops, Kerry said. Kerry's initial remark was an attempt to be intellectually honest about the uncertainty of the Syria mission. Good for him. He was just ""thinking out loud,"" he said, another praiseworthy characteristic. Alas, these are two things you are never supposed to do in public in politics. If Kerry can't keep ground troops from invading his hypotheticals, it might be harder to keep them out of Syria than the administration is pretending. But Kerry's slip, and his emergency effort to extinguish it, are emblematic of a larger problem with the war-selling effort. The president and his team are doing everything they can to push the Syria mission as a limited and hermetically sealed effort. When risks are talked about it's almost entirely the risk of doing nothing. The word ""tailored"" has been used so many times by the administration, the mission should be named Operation Bespoke Reply. This effort to sanitize should worry and irritate us. We should worry because someone in charge might actually believe a military operation can be as precise and tailored as the Obama team is claiming. When you deny risk or believe you've contained it with careful legislative language, you invite danger. You either don't see the surprises or you whittle down your options so thoroughly to win the vote in Congress, you make it impossible to win the operation in Syria. ""We've tried to minimize that risk in every way we can,"" Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel assured the Foreign Relations Committee. ""Every presentation we've made to the president. The president has insisted on that."" But as William Tecumseh Sherman said, ""Every attempt to make war easy and safe will result in humiliation and disaster."" This is the lesson of Iraq. Our leaders fooled themselves into thinking they'd licked risk. America would be greeted as a liberator; the insurgents were just dead enders. (This was also the mistake that preceded the financial collapse. Boy, do I have a five-part series for you!) It is the constant state of risk that makes warfare so ugly. Maybe Obama's War Council is all too aware of the risks of the Syrian mission. In that case, they're trying to fool the public. That's not just dishonest. That undermines the president's effort. Those pushing action argue that only America can take on this mission. In doing so they are appealing to a sense of American greatness that goes beyond our military might. It's not just missiles and tanks that make this greatness. It's that America is willing to take the risk. That's why it's a burden. Still, we decide that the burden is worth it to make the world a better place. Other countries notice and follow our lead. For many this notion may be a fantasy, and thus they deplore the Syria mission. Others may believe that Syria isn't a situation to call on America's greatness. Those are valid arguments, but the president has blown past them. He's putting his chips on the notion of America's unique role in the world. Given that he's embracing that argument, he and his team shouldn't undermine it by avoiding a genuine conversation about the risks. To do so engages in a version of the sin they say was one of George W. Bush's greatest: He never talked about the possible risks Americans would face from war in Iraq or called the country to embrace the burden. To talk honestly about burdens and things that could go wrong is a politically dumb idea of course. In the latest Pew poll about the possible Syrian action, 74 percent of those who oppose the effort say their biggest worry is that it might lead to a backlash in the region. Violence will cause more violence. Those people are not going to be swayed by more talk about risk. So maybe it's stupid to go to war saying ""here it comes and it might hurt."" Still, the logic of Obama's appeal to Congress requires it. He's asking for the vote of the people's representatives to validate his decision. That can't be done on a wink."

23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/09/obama_s_syria_bombing_resolution_republican_arguments_against_it.html	"Over the past few fruitless months, a group of Syrian-Americans has been lobbying the White House and Congress to do something about the nightmare in their homeland. Their argument, according to the people making and getting the calls, is that opposing ""intervention"" means letting a war rage on. Supporting intervention doesn't mean launching another Iraq; it means stopping another Rwanda. You all saw Hotel Rwanda, didn't you, congressmen? Didn't you? The campaign is calibrated to work around the familiar ""anti-war movement,"" the people who opposed the Iraq War. In London, certainly, the push to strike Syria was stopped by people who'd been anti-war 10 years ago and those in the now Tony Blair-free Labour Party who'd wished they'd been anti-war 10 years ago. In Washington, as the lobbyists are finding out, the votes on Syria are impossible to predict. Here are some of the arguments you should expect to hear from Republicans in the coming week, moving from dovish to hawkish. Don't call us isolationists, but we want to stay isolated, thanks. The Republicans aligned with Ron Paul's movement, starting with his son-turned-senator, have done the patriarch proud. Rand Paul keeps going on TV and radio and repeating that the United States has ""no interests"" in Syria's civil war. Michigan Republican Rep. Justin Amash has hitched his wagon to ""a lot from members of our Armed Forces"" who he says are telling him to vote no on any intervention. Kentucky Rep. Tom Massie and North Carolina Rep. Walter Jones are saying the same thing. The Paulians know how to get attention--neo-isolationism is still fascinating to the media, and Amash is hosting 11 public meetings this week to prove the just-stay-out consensus. They're not going to be moved, and they know that their position has popular support among voters who oppose intervention by a large majority. We support the troops but oppose the war. Amash's argument about the reluctant-but-heroic troops is pretty easy to recycle. New York Rep. Chris Gibson, who holds one of the last swing seats, explained his reluctance by reminding reporters that he was ""a 29-year veteran of the United States military with multiple combat tours."" Given that, said Gibson, ""it is my judgment that military intervention would make it worse and make us responsible for that conflict."" Ten years after the invasion of Iraq, in an era of omnipresent social media, it's not hard to find active or retired members of the military willing to criticize a Syria strike. We won't bail out Obama. Just a month or so ago, Republicans were ruling out a vote for an immigration bill because they didn't trust Obama to enforce the law. That's a useful, reusable theory: Obama's going to blow this thing anyway, so why help him? ""The fruit of President Obama's failed foreign policy has contributed to the chaos and instability in Libya and Egypt,"" said Rep. Michele Bachmann. ""President Obama has not demonstrated a vital American national security interest in the conflict in Syria or a clear strategy outlining what the use of force would accomplish."" Time for a blue-ribbon commission. To be fair, only one member of Congress so far wants to assemble a group of wise avengers who might assess and guide the Syria strategy. That's Virginia Rep. Frank Wolf, who's responsible for the 2006 creation of the James Baker-led Iraq Study Group. Wolf's now calling for ... a Syria group that could include ""former Secretary of State Jim Baker, who has extensive experience in the Middle East and served as co-chair of the Iraq Study Group,"" and may include ""other names that come to mind not to mention unconventional, but potentially strategic actors, like the Vatican."" Go ahead, as long as you don't use the ground troops no one is actually talking about using. The initial White House version of the force resolution was incredibly broad. Anonymous Senate aides criticized it for not specifying that the intervention would consist only of missile strikes, leaving the door open for a ground invasion. Members of Congress noticed. ""I don't see a way forward,"" said Florida Republican Rep. Tom Rooney, ""but U.S. boots on the ground is out of the question in my opinion."" Faster, please, and with more missiles. The easiest gets for the White House are the Republicans who're ready for action and irritated that it didn't come sooner. Arkansas Rep. Tom Cotton, who's got even odds of becoming the state's next senator, told reporters in his state that a strike on Syria might be widened to take out airfields. Some of these arguments come from Republicans who can't possibly vote for Obama's resolution, no matter what evidence they see from the administration. The rest leave substantial room to ""evolve."" And on the left, some of the people who'd opposed Bush-era foreign adventures are already cracking. Minnesota Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison, one of just two Muslims in Congress, was quick to endorse strikes as the humanitarian option. ""I just don't think the world can stand by and say, 'That's OK, that's not our business, we don't have to worry about it,' "" he said, referring to the reports of chemical weapons attacks launched by the Bashar al-Assad regime. Give the Republicans enough room to condemn Obama, give the Democrats enough assurances that this is a humanitarian mission--oh, be sure to compare Assad to Hitler and failure to bomb to ""appeasement,"" just so the message about Israel isn't missed--and the resolution begins to look passable."

24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/08/syria_intercepted_communication_the_u_s_should_release_information_not_bomb.html	"Here we go again. Maybe. Ten years ago Colin Powell publicly presented the United Nations with formerly top-secret information about a Middle East tyrant and weapons of mass destruction to justify military action against him. The tyrant was Saddam Hussein and the briefing turned out to be a concoction of misinterpretation, wishful thinking, and, in the case of information from a German spy codenamed ""Curveball,"" complete fabrication. In a memoir published last year, Colin Powell wrote that this presentation would forever be a blot on his reputation. The same could be said for U.S. efforts at creating global support for armed action. Reports from various sources this week suggest that the Obama administration has hard evidence--communications intercepts--proving Syrian government involvement in the recent chemical weapons attack on civilians that left at least 350 dead. Although the Los Angeles Times is reporting that some of this information comes from Israel, other reports suggest that the information is the product of CIA eavesdropping. It also appears that Washington is preparing to release some of it. How can we do it right this time? There are only two officials in the U.S. government who can declassify information on their own authority: the president and the director of the CIA. During the Bush years Dick Cheney argued that the vice president could, too, but no one hears Joe Biden making that argument these days. Presidents have used this power to influence policy. Leaving aside the Bush administration's great fail, the efforts have brought mixed results, and these efforts don't happen often. The two most famous examples took place in 1962 and 1986. During the Cuban missile crisis, John F. Kennedy decided to show the world photographic evidence that the Soviets were placing offensive missiles on Cuba. In 1986, Ronald Reagan revealed intercepts from the Libyan government to make his case that Muammar Qaddafi was involved in targeting U.S. service members in Europe and bombing the LaBelle discotheque in Berlin, which killed three people and wounded scores more. The U.S. intelligence community does not like this kind of declassification. The eavesdroppers, in particular, worry that once you blow a communications source by revealing intercepted information, the target country will react by improving its communications security. The favorite example in NSA-world is ULTRA, the information obtained by breaking Nazi ciphers during World War II. Had Hitler learned how vulnerable his communications were, ULTRA could have been lost and the battle for Europe would have lasted considerably longer. But presidents are elected to make the bigger call and overrule intelligence security officers when necessary. There are times when international reputation requires giving up an intelligence source to show that the United States is not engaged in some imperial adventure. In light of recent events in Syria, this is one of those times. Kennedy decided to reveal actual U-2 photographs of Cuba, in the process giving away some tradecraft secrets, such as the resolution of these spy photographs. Reagan was a little more circumspect. In his televised speech on April 14, 1986, he provided paraphrases of the intercepted information and not the raw reports themselves. [indent] ""On March 25th, more than a week before the attack, orders were sent from Tripoli to the Libyan People's Bureau in East Berlin to conduct a terrorist attack against Americans to cause maximum and indiscriminate casualties. Libya's agents then planted the bomb. On April 4th the People's Bureau alerted Tripoli that the attack would be carried out the following morning. The next day they reported back to Tripoli on the great success of their mission.""[end indent] Nevertheless, Tripoli learned enough from this revelation to improve its security. There was, however, a big difference between President Kennedy and President Reagan's motives: Kennedy released the information to build international support for the removal of the missiles. Reagan released the information after the U.S. Air Force had bombed Tripoli, to justify unilateral action. President Obama needs to be thinking along the lines of building international support for action, but not necessarily military action. A unilateral military attack by the United States--or one by NATO-light involving the addition of only the United Kingdom and France--is a bad idea. Unless cruise missiles or gravity bombs kill him, an attack will not unseat Assad. Instead it will be manipulated by the Syrian regime and others--Russia--to further inflame anti-American passions. And if history is a fair judge, it will not have a deterrent effect. The 1986 attack on Libya did not end Qaddafi's sponsorship of terror. He immediately retaliated by having his secret service ""buy"" one of the U.S. hostages held by Hezbollah in Lebanon--Peter Kilburn, a librarian at the American University in Beirut--and kill him. Two years later, Qaddafi ordered the destruction of Pan Am Flight 103, which crashed in Lockerbie, Scotland and killed 270 people. Unless the U.S. attack kills Assad, the madness will continue. It is not really clear why this is our fight. What did President Obama really mean last August when he apparently drew a red line over the use of WMDs by the Syrians? Obama said that his reluctance to intervene would change if he received evidence of a ""whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized."" He never made clear what a ""whole bunch"" meant or why this made the issue a U.S. military rather than a humanitarian issue. If he were thinking about civilian deaths as a threshold, why would it matter whether the deaths were caused by unconventional weapons? Until historians have at the entrails of the Obama administration in 40 years (or before then if the Obama team produces better than average memoirs), we may not be able to figure out whether the president just goofed. It is hard to believe that he thought a statement would deter a desperate tyrant. Moreover, the statement seems too uncharacteristically inarticulate to have been planned. In any case, there is an opportunity here to help Syrians attacked by their own government and strengthen international ethics. If the Obama administration were just to release the information it has and not act as if it wanted permission for a decision already made, it might be able to transform this situation from Assad vs. Obama into what it ought to have been all along: a case of Assad vs. the conscience of the world. Assuming that the intelligence is of the Kennedy/Reagan and not the George W. Bush standard, the release would encourage a welcome global discussion of Assad's criminal behavior without the distraction of yet another annoying and self-righteous ""Why must Americans act like the world's policeman"" gripe session among European elites. Some will claim that the information is deception from the United States and Israel, but if the actual intercepts are released the case will be harder to dispute. (If there is audio, the accents and vocabulary would give the Syrians away.) At the same time, this release would expose Assad's international supporters to the condemnation that they deserve. The Soviet Union finally acknowledged what the photographs showed, that it put missiles in Cuba. And this time, U.S. intelligence evidence would similarly complicate Russia's ability to help a troublesome ally. As human beings, we ought to be concerned about the plight of Syrian civilians. But this crime against humanity should not be viewed as an American policy challenge--that's a bit arrogant, isn't it? It is the world's problem. Obama has the opportunity to shame the world into doing the right thing. If that's what he meant by saying during the 2012 campaign that we are ""the one indispensable nation in world affairs,"" great. Let's use some of the products of the many billions we probably spend on intelligence each year to force international action to deal with yet another Middle East tyrant. The raw intelligence should be shared with the United Nations, with Doctors Without Borders and with the International Court of Justice at the Hague without being processed into a sanitized U.S. government white paper. Let those organizations, helped by social media, spark a global conversation over what the world community ought to do about it. Meanwhile, we could join the British and the French (and I would expect, the Canadians) in working behind the scenes with some newly developed nations to demand action in the U.N. General Assembly. Among the responsibilities of being the sole global superpower is the obligation to use restraint when prudent. However, if what is meant by ""indispensable nation"" is that we ought to launch tomahawks at Damascus to send a message (because we can), everyone should take a deep breath and be reminded of yesterday's news from Baghdad, where a rash of car bombs has delivered yet more death and destruction to the civilian population of a former foreign policy project of ours."

25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/08/ted_cruz_and_rand_paul_endorsements_the_grass_roots_support_from_the_tea.html	"Republican politics has gotten so complicated, even the members known for drawing bright lines are getting fuzzy. Sen. Ted Cruz is vice chairman of the committee charged with re-electing Republicans, but he refuses to endorse John Cornyn, the senior Republican senator from his own state. Sen. Rand Paul said he would like Sen. Lamar Alexander to win re-election, but he won't endorse the Tennessee Republican. He is, however, endorsing Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who supported Paul's rival in the 2010 GOP primary, though Paul also says he's going to stay out of the race between McConnell and his Tea Party challenger. Nevertheless, Paul will do everything he can to help incumbent Sen. Mike Enzi, who is being challenged in the Wyoming Senate Republican primary by Liz Cheney, whose interventionist foreign policy Paul dislikes. It is generally accepted that endorsements are meaningless. Voters make up their minds based on the candidate, not the people he or she locks arms with. But the peculiarities of this election season's endorsement dance tell us something about the battle between the grass-roots and establishment forces inside the Republican Party. The movement devoted to unseating incumbents has become a permanent fixture of our politics and highlights the new routes to power for ambitious young Republicans. It used to be that a senator like Cornyn, the second-most-powerful Republican in the Senate, could rely on seniority and incumbency. The re-election rates in the United States Senate hover around 90 percent. Even fewer senators lose their party primaries. But with the rise of the Tea Party in 2010, Washington titles started to provide less protection. Cornyn faces a primary opponent, and while it is highly unlikely he will lose, the same is not true for Mitch McConnell in Kentucky, the most powerful Republican in the Senate. He faces a Tea Party challenger whom he may be able to beat, but who will at the very least cause distraction, bleed his bank account, and potentially put McConnell in a weaker spot for the general election. The situation is perilous enough for the minority leader that Jennifer Duffy of the Cook Political Report has moved McConnell's race into the tossup column. As the old bulls get weaker, the young bucks get stronger. So Lamar Alexander, a former governor and Cabinet official who drew a primary challenger last week, is anxious to show his ties to a Senate newcomer like Rand Paul by running a television ad in which the two are shown working together. McConnell hired Paul's campaign strategist Jesse Benton to run his campaign. While endorsements may not win votes directly, if you stand with Rand, it can offer a shield against criticism. If you have no military experience, it helps to be supported by a decorated general. If I'm good enough for this four-star hero, who are you to question me? If a senator can point to a seal of approval from a grass-roots hero, it might be enough to short-circuit a nuisance candidate. ""Lamar would care less about Paul if he was running unopposed,"" says a party strategist working on the 2014 Senate campaigns, ""but Rand Paul is connected to 20 grass-roots activists and they have networks of thousands of people. Keeping all of that at bay and not working against you is valuable."" Once upon a time, young, ambitious politicians curried favor with the leadership. A man in a hurry like Sen. Cruz would jump to endorse Cornyn in the hopes that the senior senator would help him within the institution and provide access to his base of donors when Cruz came up for re-election. Since Cornyn is ranked as one of the most conservative senators, that young politician wouldn't be offending his ideological base by backing a squish. But for Cruz there is more to be gained by standing outside the institution than by playing within its rules. Cruz's decision not to endorse any incumbents affirms his status as an ""outsider,"" which is linked to his Tea Party base and his policy goals. In separating himself from the political establishment, Cruz matches his aggressive effort to prod GOP lawmakers to act more forcefully to dismantle the federal government. The key example at the moment is the Texan's push to force a budget showdown over the Affordable Care Act. John Kennedy jumped the line too, so going around the old bulls is not a new idea, but what Cruz and Paul hint at is a new permanent pathway. In Wyoming Liz Cheney is testing whether there is a broader market for this approach, which is not simply conservative but aggressively anti-establishment. She is trying to unseat faithful conservative Mike Enzi not because he isn't conservative in his votes but because he hasn't been aggressively conservative in shaking up the Senate. But you want to get the balance right between sticking with your anti-establishment base and still having access to the establishment's money and power. In the future, if Cruz and Paul want to run for president, they will need money from the establishment forces that tend to populate the GOP donor class. Plus, they'll need to appeal to those voters who have consistently nominated moderates to carry the party's standard. This attention to the inevitable force of the establishment is what many GOP strategists see behind Rand Paul's different endorsement decisions. By backing Mitch McConnell, Paul is keeping at least a toe in the establishment world. His core supporters may be suspicious of McConnell and the forces he represents, but Paul knows he needs to have a tie to that larger GOP audience for his re-election campaign in 2016. Jesse Benton, Paul's strategist who is working on McConnell's re-election, put it bluntly in a recent phone call he didn't know was being recorded. ""I'm sorta holding my nose for two years because what we're doing here is going to be a big benefit to Rand in '16. So that's my long vision,"" he told a Tea Party ally. The tensions between movement conservatives distrustful of entrenched Washington power and the organized Republican Party have existed for the last 50 years or more, but what campaign strategists say is new is that the apparatus for channeling that grass-roots anger has become more professional and permanent. This is unique to the Republican Party, which has a more organized and larger conservative base able to affect party politics than the liberal base in the Democratic Party. In the 1990s conservatives backed various term-limit movements, but they fizzled. Nothing has had the sustaining power of the loose coalition of movement conservative groups that can now channel voter anger. It is made up of conservative organizations like the Club for Growth, the Senate Conservatives Fund, FreedomWorks, Heritage Action, and others, which single out incumbents they think fall short of being true conservatives and sometimes spend money to defeat them. RedState and the social networks these organizations connect to offer the conservative movement a megaphone against incumbency. The question of how to strike the balance between the two camps in the Republican Party is a mix of personal ambition, ad hoc purity tests, and affection for the benefits of actual power, which can undermine the purists in the grass roots. (Republicans still have a pretty good chance at taking back control of the Senate). Though the anti-establishment is becoming more disciplined, structured, and professional, that doesn't mean the rules of endorsement will be any more predictable."

Tannehill used to fly naval attack helicopters, not entirely unlike the Apache helicopters shown in ""Collateral Murder,"" the video Manning sent to WikiLeaks revealing U.S. air strikes in Baghdad that left two Reuters journalists and a number of unarmed people dead. But after working as a pilot and analyst over 10 years and four deployments, Tannehill had to drop out of the military in 2010, when she began transitioning from a man to a woman. Tannehill, who is now the director of advocacy at SPART*A, an organization that advocates for the rights of trans men and women serving in the military, worries Manning's actions reflect badly on trans service members. ""If you're wondering if she's being embraced as a hero in the military trans community, she is absolutely not,"" Tannehill says. ""People in our group can empathize with the strain that being transgender and closeted in the military causes, but we do not in any way, shape, or form think this excuses or mitigates what she did."" The U.S. military doesn't allow openly trans men and women to serve, even though it's estimated that 20 percent of trans people have served, compared to 10 percent of the general U.S. population. Trans members of the military are allowed to serve openly in Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Spain, but a U.S. military regulation dating back to the 1970s classifies gender dysphoria as a ""psychosexual condition"" or, alternately, as proof of a ""history of abnormalities or defects of the genitalia."" According to the Department of Defense, trans people are physically unfit to serve. In April 2010, Manning told a supervisor about struggling with her gender identity, and talked with a counselor about how someone transitions from male to female. ""The problem is that someone who's trans, they have no idea if the therapist is going to turn them in,"" Tannehill says. ""Talking to anybody is always a crapshoot."" In online chats that May with Adrian Lamo, the computer hacker who ultimately gave Manning up to the authorities, Manning mentioned wanting to transition five times. In the chats, Manning described herself as ""very effeminate"" growing up and said kids at school would call her ""girly boy."" She mentions wanting to try living as a woman when she came home from deployment. Manning best described her internal gender struggle in computer hardware terms: ""(1:13:10 PM) bradass87: i just... dont wish to be a part of it... at least not now... im not ready... i wouldn't mind going to prison for the rest of my life, or being executed so much, if it wasn't for the possibility of having pictures of me... plastered all over the world press... as boy... (1:14:11 PM) bradass87: i've totally lost my mind... i make no sense... the CPU is not made for this motherboard..."" Lauren McNamara, a trans woman who occasionally chatted with Manning online in 2009, compares the misconceptions we have about gender dysphoria to depression and anxiety. It's often viewed as a mental defect, not a treatable medical condition. Like those who suffer from depression, there's a high rate of suicide for trans people--in one survey, 41 percent of trans people said they had attempted to kill themselves, compared to 1.6 percent of the general population. ""Gender dysphoria is effectively a life-threatening condition,"" McNamara says. ""This is no different than denying someone access to blood pressure medication or antibiotics."" The American Psychological Association has called for an end to policies that discriminate against trans workers. Until recently, the American Psychiatric Association categorized all forms of gender dysphoria as a mental condition, but updated their definition to distinguish dysphoria from other, nonclinical forms of gender expression: ""It is important to note that gender nonconformity is not in itself a mental disorder. The critical element of gender dysphoria is the presence of clinically significant distress associated with the condition."" Chelsea Manning's coming out as a woman does not automatically make her a heroic figure--for that, trans service members already have Kristin Beck, who served in the U.S. Navy for 20 years and was a member of SEAL Team 6. Indeed, some members of the trans community took strong exception to the way Manning's legal team coopted gender dysphoria for her defense. Jacob Eleazer, a SPART*A chapter leader, was one. He counsels trans service members through a secretive online group where members can seek legal advice and support. Eleazer objected to the defense's argument that Manning's gender dysphoria contributed to giving up thousands of classified documents to WikiLeaks. ""It's appropriate for the defense to zealously do everything that they can in order to defend their client, but I also see where that defense is problematic for the trans community in general,"" he says. ""We have a lot of trans people serving right now, and they aren't committing treason."" "	Why Chelsea Manning Is No Hero for Trans Soldiers	[]	[]

As it turns out, many Founding Fathers were younger than 40 years old in 1776, with several qualifying as Founding Teenagers or Twentysomethings. And though the average age of the signers of the Declaration of Independence was 44, more than a dozen of them were 35 or younger. ""We tend to see them as much older than they were,"" said John Adams biographer David McCullough in a 2005 speech. ""Because we're seeing them in portraits by Gilbert Stuart and others when they were truly the Founding Fathers--when they were president or chief justice of the Supreme Court and their hair, if it hadn't turned white, was powdered white. We see the awkward teeth. We see the elder statesmen. At the time of the revolution, they were all young. It was a young man's-young woman's cause."" A list of ages of important American Revolution characters seems elementary enough, and certainly easy to assemble, yet I wasn't able to find such a list anywhere I looked. And I don't recall ever stumbling upon such an appendix while researching my book, so I figured I'd just make one. This is a list of ages, from youngest to oldest, of key American Revolution figures, providing their age as of July 4, 1776. An asterisk signifies that the individual was a signer of the Declaration of Independence. A double asterisk means that there is evidence that the person's age is not precise, or only a birth year is known. If you spot any corrections or recommend any additions, let me know in the comments and I'll continue modifying the original list."

28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/08/bill_de_blasio_is_the_un_bloomberg_why_the_ny_mayoral_candidate_is_suddenly.html	"""Will you stay in touch with us?"" Bill de Blasio asks this of each potential voter as he stands outside of Trader Joe's on 21st Street in Manhattan. He's joined on the crowded sidewalk by two campaign aides and half a dozen volunteers. The potential voters are actually stopping to talk, and passersby end up waiting in line to speak with the mayoral candidate. A middle-aged man walks by and shouts, ""This is the next mayor of New York City!"" Cabbies honk and cheer as they pass de Blasio on Sixth Avenue. This is all very new to de Blasio. The city's public advocate since 2009 and the most identifiably liberal Democrat in the race, de Blasio saw his poll numbers surge in the Quinnipiac poll taken immediately after Anthony Weiner's latest scandal. In late July, he polled at 21 percent, up from 15 percent, putting him within striking distance of de facto front-runner Christine Quinn, and essentially tied with former City Comptroller Bill Thompson. The surge continued, as two weeks later the same poll puts de Blasio at 30 percent. He's your new Next Mayor of New York. Weiner's entry into the race seemed like a death sentence for de Blasio--one candidate was exciting, the other, less so. But reports that de Blasio is a boring, wonky city pol are a bit exaggerated. He cannily works the voters gathered outside the Trader Joe's. It is a receptive crowd for the Brooklynite, the kind that eats up his familiar ""tale of two cities"" slogan and nods in assent when he prefaces a statement with, ""Now, I'm not a CEO, but ..."" It's a line he uses often, and it's carefully chosen: The CEO is Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and de Blasio is the anti-Bloomberg, the empathetic, middle-class progressive who will roll back the legacy of Mayor Mike. Indeed, that legacy weighs heavily on each of the Democratic candidates, whose party has lived in the shadows of Mayors Bloomberg and Guiliani for a long time. It weighs heaviest on Quinn, the City Council speaker whose decision to let Bloomberg run for a third term is brought up constantly by the rest of the field as an example of the roll-over acquiescence to City Hall that has humiliated New York Democrats for years. Ultimately, the bottom line of the Democratic primary has become Quinn--the relative moderate who promises to do some things, but not all things, differently--versus the rest, who generally want to tear down Fortress Bloomberg and start over. De Blasio is warm with me--""step into my office,"" he jokingly says as we talk under a Trader Joe's awning--but gets prickly fast when it comes to discussing Bill Thompson. He's loath to admit that the disappearance of Weiner has pitted the two directly against each other, but the two campaigns' behaviors suggest that each man is well aware that only one of them will be moving on to a hypothetical runoff with Quinn. Getting rid of the NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy is a cornerstone of the de Blasio platform and a frequent talking point. Thompson, the race's only African-American candidate, has been harder to pin down on the issue: He publicly opposes the policy but has twice voted down City Council bills that sought to mitigate the effects of stop-and-frisk. So after Thompson gave a fiery Sunday morning church address condemning stop-and-frisk , de Blasio accused Thompson of trying to ""have it both ways"" on the issue. That prompted the Thompson campaign to fire back with a press release signed by black leaders calling de Blasio's remarks ""deeply offensive."" Thompson said himself: ""For Bill to cheap shot me on stop-and-frisk and racial profiling? It's insulting and Bill should know better."" De Blasio, whose so-called ""modern family"" (African-American wife, mixed-race children) garners a lot of attention, released an ad last week in which his teenage son Dante touts his dad's opposition to stop-and-frisk. ""He's the only one who will end a stop-and-frisk era that unfairly targets people of color,"" he says in the campaign's first TV spot. De Blasio is frustrated when I ask him about the exchanges. Besides hitting Thompson on his failures to get rid of the policy when he could, he bristles at any notion that he and Thompson are direct rivals. ""I want to counter the premise of your question,"" he says, brow furrowed. ""There are three candidates in this race."" That is to say, no Weiner. When she has to talk about the Weiner Effect, Chirlane McCray, de Blasio's wife, is candid but not necessarily clear on the subject. Easygoing and engaging like her husband, and a constant presence on the campaign trail, McCray summed up Weiner's downfall succinctly: ""Thank goodness."" I press her a little more, but she simply shakes her head. ""Thank goodness."" Citing the city's ""celebrity-driven culture,"" she tells me that her husband eschewed headline-grabbing antics for important but low-key challenges. ""If Bill were on the front page of the Times, the Post, the Daily News, for fighting to keep hospitals open, everyone would know who he is."" That hospital story did make the Times, but only in the context of an article about de Blasio finally earning some media attention. If de Blasio manages to best Thompson and move to the runoff with Quinn, he'd suddenly find himself thrust in the national spotlight, which is unfamiliar territory for the career public servant. De Blasio proudly touts his progressive bonafides, such as a plan to tax every New Yorker making over $500,000 to fund universal pre-K. But the media hasn't vetted him yet. For now, there is a pervasive sense of vindication in his camp, the relieved satisfaction that, finally, their guy is getting the attention he deserves. They are excited that a man who has thought of himself as the anti-Bloomberg for years is being recognized as such and being commended for injecting some much needed substance into a race that has often felt like a circus. In Chelsea, a man comes up to shake de Blasio's hand, telling him, ""I just wanted to meet the next mayor of New York City."" De Blasio smiles. ""Will you stay in touch with us?"""

29	29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/08/ted_cruz_in_iowa_social_conservatives_want_him_to_run_for_president_now.html	"AMES, Iowa--It's like the landscapers are mocking us. On Saturday morning, a substantial rump of the political press corps has flown into Des Moines and driven the 30 minutes up to Iowa State University. The FAMiLY Leader, a coalition of social conservatives, has booked a concert hall for an all-day schedule of speeches and prayers, adjacent to the site where the Iowa Republican Party usually holds its for-profit straw poll. The lawn that's usually auctioned off to presidential candidates and occupied by gaudy tents and food trucks is being resodded. Of course it is--there are two years until the next straw poll. And yet inside the concert hall, it's already primary season. Rick Santorum, who's been in the state for two days and already hit a party fundraiser and the state fair, fields questions from a dozen reporters who want him to commit to 2016. One asks him if he caught ""lightning in a bottle"" last time when he narrowly won the nonbinding precinct caucuses, and whether he now needs a new strategy and larger staff. ""Three hundred and eighty town hall visits and 99 counties last time,"" says Santorum, holding back an eye-roll. ""I don't know if that's catching lightning in a bottle."" A few steps away, Iowa Rep. Steve King walks through hypotheticals about the next Republican field. Does Rand Paul have the advantage? Should candidates be here already? ""It's always important to be here early,"" says King. Jonathan Martin, the roving New York Times reporter, sets the time machine even further in the future--summer 2016, when the party will hold its convention. ""Is it important that the next winner of the caucus be the nominee?"" he asks. ""It's still relatively early in the process,"" says King. ""What we do in Iowa is, we punch one, two, or maybe three tickets to New Hampshire."" The focus on the 2016 presidential contest is completely ridiculous, and everybody knows it. After he followed Sen. Ted Cruz and Sen. Rand Paul to a Des Moines summit of pastors in July, Yahoo News reporter Chris Moody joked that ""running into other reporters in Iowa for presidential coverage in 2013 is like locking eyes with a church friend at a strip club."" But this isn't any earlier than usual, and it's not really the media's fault this time. The way social conservative see it, they've blown two consecutive primaries to a moderate candidate--one who's gone on to lose the presidency. Iowa's supposed to be the Thunderdome that boosts one of their own. In 2012, a majority (57 percent) of caucus-goers were evangelical Christians and a plurality (47 percent) considered themselves ""very conservative."" They split their votes and gave the narrowest of mandates to Rick Santorum, and that was two weeks after the FAMiLY Leader endorsed him. What could have happened had the rest of the movement been quicker on the draw. Could they have avoided the distractions of Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich? They want to find out. That's what's driving the presidential talk around Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who arrived in his first elective office this past January. Jamie Johnson, who'd been Rick Santorum's coalitions director in Iowa, tells me that Barack Obama ""changed the game"" in 2008 and proved that someone with just a little time in D.C. could win. ""He was in for one year and he was already laying the groundwork."" This is why he's switched from Santorum to Cruz, who doesn't have ""10 years of votes to apologize for."" ""Before, there was never a mixture of the limited government, fire-breathing prophet with a Christian conservative, moral-based guy,"" says Johnson. ""When the conservative base of the Republican Party has a David, to use a biblical analogy--when they have their David, it's obvious who their David is--it doesn't matter where the money is. Ted Cruz is the only guy who fits that bill. He's the only one who can speak to the religious right, to the economic conservatives."" The implication, although Johnson is being genteel about it, is that Santorum can't. Santorum gets 20 minutes to address the 1,000-odd conservatives in Ames, who fill about half a room that recently saw tours from Bill Cosby and Shrek: The Musical. Santorum spends the time on dark lessons, with personal anecdotes, of how his movement keeps blowing it. He mourns how the 2012 Republican National Convention obsessed over Barack Obama's ""you didn't build that"" gaffe by giving floor time only to aggrieved business-owners. ""Not one time did we see someone from the factory floor walk out there and talk about working for the man or woman who built that business, and talk about how that helped them,"" he says. ""Not everybody in America is a type-A personality who's going to spend 80 hours a week building their business."" Telling this alternate history lets Santorum's audience imagine how somebody else--not naming names!--might have run in 2012. Oh, and he's not done settling scores. Santorum tells the audience of a time he met with potential donors in New York, and how they spent the meeting grilling him on social issues. ""I asked, 'Did you ask the other candidates up here about their moral positions?' "" he says. ""They said, 'You're different.' I said, 'Why am I different?' They said, 'Because you mean it.' "" The audience cheers this righteous smackdown of the snobs, and cheers even louder when Santorum tells them to take pop culture back from Hollywood. He's not giving them a special, tailored speech; he gave basically the same speech to Republicans in Lyon County*, two days earlier, at one point telling them to stop repeating ""Marxist"" jargon like ""middle class."" It just sounds defensive. Cruz, who has already cracked double digits in the ridiculously early polls of caucus-goers, takes the afternoon of the summit with a neat trick that outsources the negativity. His father, Rafael, a Cuban-born pastor, precedes him with a speech that's one-third about his son and two-thirds about how candidates who promise ""hope and change"" are paving the road to serfdom. ""In 1976 I was shocked when I saw a government starting to implement socialist policies in this country, which perhaps the majority of this country didn't recognize,"" he says. ""Having seen socialism at work, I clearly recognized the socialist policies of Jimmy Carter."" It's a hit. More than one activist tells me that the senior Cruz's story takes away an advantage that has belonged to Marco Rubio--the crowd-pleasing parable of Obama as Castro. After a short break, Ted Cruz himself arrives, walking back and forth across the stage in black ostrich-skin cowboy boots, delivering old jokes about the root words of ""politics"" being ""poly"" and ""ticks"" before getting to applause line after applause line about his battles in Washington. ""The American people want to secure the borders first,"" he says, to applause. ""We want to welcome and celebrate legal immigrants."" Applause. ""And there is no more forceful advocate for securing the borders than Iowa's own Steve King."" Yet more applause. Cruz doesn't actually mention any ""social issues."" He invites the audience to join a ""grass-roots army"" (and his PAC) and adds that he has objects ""thrown at me"" when he talks about defunding Obamacare in the Senate. He repeats a riff on ""you didn't build that"" he's been using since at least December 2012. ""The untold story about the economy is about those who've been hurt--the least among us. If you were flying a private jet five years ago, you're still flying a private jet."" Cruz leaves the stage and reporters flood the hallway he's expected to use when he heads to the airport. The senator takes his time, talking to pastors backstage. When he emerges, the press tries its best to pin him down on a 2016 schedule. He turns every answer into a statement about Obamacare. ""The biggest fight facing Congress right now is the fight to defund Obamacare,"" he says. ""The only way we will get this done is if millions of activists mobilize."" ""You're here in Iowa to rule out running for president?"" asks one reporter. ""I am here and traveling across Texas and across the country to help mobilize the grass-roots,"" says Cruz. Jonathan Martin, trying to invert the question, asks whether the struggles of America's current one-term-senator-turned-president might, you know, inform Cruz in any way. ""I respect President Obama,"" says Cruz. ""He is a man who is firmly committed to his principles."" Alas, ""I think the principles he believes in are profoundly dangerous."" He spends three minutes explaining exactly why, and why it's so important to defund Obamacare. Seeing the pointlessness of the 2016 questions, I ask Cruz whether the president needs to go further on FISA and spying transparency than he did on Friday. ""I'll wait till I watch the remarks before coming to a conclusion,"" he says. Thoroughly defeated, I walk past Rafael Cruz, who's holding a shrink-wrapped copy of the The Founders' Bible. The massive edition of the good book, decorated and annotated with facts about Revolutionary-era religion, has been selling from a booth at the summit. Cruz got a copy from J. Albert Calaway, a pastor whose organization Truth, Values, & Leadership attempts to draw pastors into politics. ""We're looking at perhaps doing some kind of a pastor's conference,"" says the senior Cruz. Calaway, who's walking back to the booth, explains that he's trying to speed up the process for finding an ideal presidential candidate. ""I vetted five of the Republicans last time,"" he says. ""I'm starting to vet the people out there now much earlier. I don't come out for anybody unless I've been behind closed doors with 'em for at least an hour. Cruz and his dad and I are gonna have a few pow-wows. Maybe we'll see if we can do a conference. I have right now 35,000 pastors organized around the country, and I'm gonna see if I get it to 50,000. See if I can get 'em out of the closet to do something."" Correction, Aug. 12, 2013: The article originally misspelled Lyon County. Return to the corrected sentence."
