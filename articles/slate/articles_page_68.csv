In February 1969--when the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite, the most trusted man in America, was watched by 20 million viewers, or 1 in 6 households--a 3-week-old baby boy of Irish descent was adopted in Los Angeles by a Jewish steakhouse owner and his banker wife, Gerald and Arlene Breitbart, and given the name Andrew. When Andrew was 2, the New York Times and the Washington Post published The Pentagon Papers, defying threats by the Nixon White House. The next year, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein were assigned by the Post to cover a break-in at Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, D.C. Andrew's toddler years coincided with the golden age of Old Media. The Breitbarts were upper-middle-class Republicans (four bedrooms, a pool, a canyon view) living in rich, liberal Brentwood. Andrew grew up on American pop culture, British new wave, and Hollywood celebrity. ""Which famous people come into the restaurant?"" he would ask his father (the Reagans, Broderick Crawford, Shirley Jones, and the Cassidy family, among lots of other celebs). Andrew took tennis lessons from the top pro in Malibu and once spent 15 unforgettable minutes looking for the instructor with Farrah Fawcett. Andrew was 11 when the Cable News Network went on the air in 1980. He was 13 when The McLaughlin Group and Crossfire introduced yelling heads to news analysis. From early on, Andrew was a breaking-news junkie. At the Brentwood School he made up for being neither famous nor rich by cutting up in class and inventing droll quotations for stories in the Brentwood Eagle about high-school social life. To keep up with his friends, he had to take a job delivering pizzas and pocketed big tips from the likes of Judge Reinhold. Basically, Andrew was ""the ultimate Generation X slacker,"" Breitbart later wrote, ""not particularly political, and, in retrospect, a default liberal. I thought that going to four movies a week, knowing the network television grid, and spending hours at Tower Records were my American birthright."" In 1987--the year that the Federal Communications Commission voted 4-0 to repeal its own Fairness Doctrine, which had been in effect since 1949 and required licensees of the public airwaves to present important issues in an honest and equitable manner (a vote that paved the way the following year for a Sacramento radio host named Rush Limbaugh to syndicate his conservative talk show nationally)--Breitbart entered Tulane. He spent his four years in New Orleans partying with a group of wealthy, hilarious, debauched friends; drinking himself into oblivion; and betting his parents' money on football games and backgammon. In his weakened state, Breitbart was exposed to the pernicious influence of his American studies professors and their reading lists, which included Foucault, Horkheimer, Adorno, and Marcuse rather than Emerson and Twain. Fortunately, he was too drunk to be thoroughly indoctrinated in critical theory, but the prevailing philosophy of moral relativism inevitably eroded his personal standards. It wasn't such a big step from the Frankfurt School to getting shitfaced nightly. Breitbart stumbled through graduation and returned home to L.A., where his parents cut off his stipend, giving him the shock of his life. He started waiting tables near Venice Beach. Hard work was fulfilling. ""My values were returning from exile."" In the fall of 1991, he tuned in to the Clarence Thomas hearings, fully expecting to side with Anita Hill and the Democrats. Instead, he was outraged that porn rentals and a stray comment about a stray pubic hair on a can of Coke were being used to destroy an honorable man because he was conservative and black--with supposedly neutral journalists leading the mob. Breitbart's eyes began to open, and hatred was born in his fun-loving soul. He would never forgive the mainstream media. Several more years passed before Andrew Breitbart found his mission in life. In 1992--the year Warren Buffett, a major investor in the Washington Post Company, warned that ""the economic strength of once-mighty media enterprises continues to erode as retailing patterns change and advertising and entertainment choices proliferate""--Breitbart got a job delivering scripts around Hollywood. He preferred listening to FM radio in his Saab convertible to kissing ass in the outer offices of Michael Ovitz or going to parties where people said, ""I work in the clothing room at Mad About You."" But when grunge took over the alternative rock stations (""Who were these whiny, suicidal freaks?""), he switched in disgust to the AM dial. There, talk radio was waiting for him. He found that he would do anything to listen to Howard Stern and Jim Rome. He put on a Walkman and kept listening after getting out of his car to make his script deliveries. But he was still enough of an unthinking liberal that, upon seeing Limbaugh's book The Way Things Ought to Be on the coffee table of his girlfriend's father, a TV actor named Orson Bean, he scoffed. ""Have you listened to Rush?"" Breitbart's future father-in-law asked. ""Yeah, he's a Nazi or something."" ""Are you sure you've listened to him?"" Orson Bean, a game show regular from the '60s, was the seventh-most frequent guest on The Tonight Show--his opinion counted. And after tuning in to Limbaugh over months during the 1992 campaign, Breitbart began to regard El Rushbo as his true professor. ""I marveled at how he could take a breaking news story and offer an entertaining and clear analysis that was like nothing I had ever seen on television."" The hidden structure of things was becoming clear. That same year, a friend from high school who was worried that Breitbart was adrift paid a visit to his apartment and told him, ""I've seen your future and it's the Internet."" Breitbart replied, ""What's the Internet?"" One night in 1994, he vowed not to leave his room until he was connected. It took a rotisserie chicken, a six-pack of Pilsner Urquell, and several hours of sweaty effort with a primitive modem of that time, but at last he heard the crackle of a connection and suddenly Andrew Breitbart was linked to the Internet, the one place beyond the reach of the Democrat-Media Complex where you could say and think and be anything, and he was born again. It wasn't long afterward that Breitbart found a one-man news digest called the Drudge Report--a mishmash of politics, Hollywood gossip, and extreme weather reports. He was hooked, and when Drudge began exposing Clinton sex scandals that the media wouldn't touch, Breitbart knew what he wanted to do with his life. Drudge and the Internet rescued him from the cynical irony of his generation and showed him the power of one individual to expose the corruption of the complex. Breitbart was so awed that he sent an email to the secretive Matt Drudge: ""Are you fifty people? A hundred people? Is there a building?"" Drudge introduced him to a rich Greek-born L.A. divorcee and author named Arianna Huffington, who wanted to do the same kind of awesome Web-based muckraking as Drudge. In the summer of 1997--a year after MSNBC and Fox News launched--Breitbart was invited to her Brentwood mansion, and over spanakopita and iced tea Arianna offered him a job. Pretty soon she couldn't get him to go home. The Internet and the conservative movement fused together in Breitbart's brain. He read Camille Paglia on academic politics and saw his whole life as an illustration of the complex's totalitarian power. He'd been living behind enemy lines ever since birth: the liberal fascism of the Hollywood elite, the left-wing bias of the mainstream media, the Nazi-fleeing German philosophers of his Tulane syllabi who had settled in L.A. and taken over higher education in order to destroy the coolest lifestyle in history and impose their Kurt Cobain-like depressive nihilistic Marxism. The left knew what the right ignored: New York, Hollywood, and college campuses mattered more than Washington, D.C. The political war was all about culture. A barely employed, autodidactic Gen-X convert with an ADD diagnosis and an Internet addiction was uniquely well-armed to fight it. For the next eight years Breitbart worked with Arianna and Drudge. He helped Arianna with her biggest coup, getting a Clinton crony who had fabricated his war record disinterred from Arlington National Cemetery. Who needed the New York Times? ""We were all doing more from Los Angeles with minimal resources than the mainstream media were doing from Washington, D.C., with hundreds of reporters."" The terrain Breitbart sauntered onto was diminishing, crumbling, wide open to him. Pillars of the Old Media were turning to infotainment and opinion journalism to save money and hold on to a distracted audience. Reporters were spooked because Jayson Blair made up stories in the Times and Dan Rather aired phony documents on 60 Minutes, while watchdogs on the right and left barked ferociously at their every hint of bias, and upstarts of the New Media jeered the frightened gatekeepers, until no one knew who was right and what was true and no one trusted the press and the press stopped trusting itself. It was the perfect environment for Breitbart to stake his own claim. In 2005--the year Rather was sacked by CBS, the Wall Street Journal reduced its width from 15 to 12 inches, the Los Angeles Times cut another 62 newsroom jobs, and Arianna, by then a liberal convert, started Huffington Post with Andrew's help (he later claimed to have thought it up as a fifth column in the complex)--Breitbart.com launched. It was a news aggregation site for wire service stories (you could bash the Old Media and feed off it at the same time) and a forum for truth-telling, in the spirit of the Swift Boat Vets and other citizen journalists. The great thing about New Media was anybody could do it. Breitbart would fly to New York all the time and make sure he got invited to mainstream media parties, where he drank their appletinis and pinot noir and made them think he was on their side, but at the end of dinner he would get in their faces and say, ""You guys don't get it. The American people are now in control of the narrative, and you can't grab it for yourself and drive it off the cliff."" Everything changed for Breitbart on the August day in 2009--the year the Chicago Tribune eliminated its foreign desk and the Washington Post closed its three remaining domestic bureaus in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles--when a young citizen journalist named James O'Keefe walked into his house with a batch of raw videos. They were the Abu Ghraib of the Great Society. They showed O'Keefe and another citizen journalist named Hannah Giles posing as a pimp and prostitute who wanted to set up a brothel using underage girls imported from El Salvador. James and Hannah brought their hidden camera into offices of the national left-wing organization ACORN in Baltimore, New York, and other cities, where low-level staffers sat across the table and gave them useful advice on how to establish their business while making the federal tax code work in their favor. ""It was like watching Western civilization fall off of a cliff."" Breitbart knew exactly what to do. Make news by breaking news. Feed the media like training a dog, one video at a time instead of the whole meal at once, catching ACORN and the news outlets off-guard, exposing their lies and biases while keeping the story alive. Use a friendly network like Fox News to amplify the effect. Stay on offense; be outrageous. His real target was the mainstream media--honestly, who cared about the poor homeowners that ACORN protected from predatory lenders, or the low-income workers whose wages it fought to raise? Within a few months, ACORN ceased to exist and Breitbart was a Tea Party hero and media bigs were competing to publish profiles of him. It felt like he was doing every single banned class-A narcotic simultaneously. It was fun! Telling the truth was fun, having the American people behind him was fun, fucking with the heads of nervous journalists and helping the mainstream media commit suicide was fun. Breitbart went on Real Time With Bill Maher and stood up for himself and Rush to the politically correct hometown mob of an audience, and it was an incredibly committed moment in his life. He found himself the leader of a loose band of patriotic malcontents, and right in front of him was the same opportunity that the Founding Fathers had had--to fight a revolution against the complex. And if he happened to get an Agriculture Department official named Shirley Sherrod fired by releasing a deceptively edited video that seemed to show her making anti-white comments when in fact she was doing just the opposite--fuck it, did the other side play fair? Anyway, Old Media's rules about truth and objectivity were dead. What mattered was getting maximum bang from a story, changing the narrative. That was why Breitbart was winning, with ample help from his media enemies, and why he must have been at least semi-sober during his college classes on moral relativism. In 2010 Breitbart was everywhere, Manhattan and D.C., the Tea Party Convention and the White House Correspondents' Dinner, Twitter and YouTube, working his BlackBerry while talking on the phone, turning his florid face and keen blue eyes and wave of graying hair toward every camera aimed in his direction, getting up close with righteous indignation and puerile humor, jabbing his finger. Kate Zernike of the New York Times, are you in the room? You're despicable. ... Ted Kennedy was a special pile of human excrement, he was a fucker, a big-ass motherfucker. ... When people are like, ""What do you think we should do on health care?"" I don't have a fucking clue, it's too complicated for me. ... It's time for the allegedly pristine character of Representative John Lewis to put up or shut up ... they think they can take me down, that they can hurt me. It just makes me bigger. ... Fuck. You. John. Podesta. ... Have you ever seen me on TV? I always change the subject to the media context. ... Media is everything. ... It's a fundamental flaw in my psyche--I don't do well with death. ... They want to portray me as crazy, unhinged, unbalanced. OK, good, fine. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck-- On March 1, 2012, in the full flame of glory, less than a year after scoring his biggest coup in the shape of Rep. Anthony Weiner's erect penis self-photographed behind gray briefs, shortly after leaving an evening of wine and talk in a Brentwood bar, Andrew Breitbart collapsed from heart failure and died at age 43.

1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/05/chris_christie_and_barack_obama_tour_new_jersey_shore_can_the_republican.html	"President Barack Obama and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie toured the rebuilt New Jersey Shore Tuesday and stopped by an arcade booth called Touchdown Fever. The game offered a stuffed bear to anyone who could toss a football through a tire. President Obama tried five times and missed. Gov. Christie threw the football through the tire on his first try. Obama gave him a high five. Christie then gave Obama the bear he won. This would make a very awkward Bruce Springsteen song, but the Obama and Christie relationship faces the same question at the heart of every one of the Boss' songs about boardwalk relationships buffeted by circumstance: Can it last? Christie is a Republican governor running in a heavily Democratic state (Obama won it by double digits) so for the moment, the answer is yes. Obama is on Team Christie. ""America, bring your family and friends. Spend a little money on the Jersey Shore,"" the president said, boosting the state during his visit as much as he did the governor's re-election chances. But if Christie wants to one day court Republican primary voters who dislike the president, won't he have to put a little distance between himself and Obama? Remember how Florida Republicans punished their governor, Charlie Crist? Isn't the breakup inevitable? If Christie decides to run for president, how he handles the Obama question will tell us something about the trajectory of his campaign: Will he try to smooth over the anger conservatives feel for his lapses from party dogma, of which the palling around with the president may sting most? Or will he run headlong at the party, using his relationship with Obama as proof of how effective pragmatic governing can be, drawing a contrast with the ideologues and debating-society candidates who can pass purity tests but haven't ever actually done anything? Christie has modified his view of President Obama before. At a speech at the Reagan Library in 2011 when he was considering a presidential run, Christie painted Obama as an ongoing calamity in leadership, representing timidity and limited vision. Now he praises Obama for those very skills he once said he lacked. Christie is still very popular and a powerful fundraising draw for the party, but he has work to do with conservatives. What angers them is not so much that Christie embraced the president when his state was in need, but that he did so at a crucial moment in the 2012 campaign. He helped burnish Obama's bipartisan credentials when he needed it most. At the very least, Christie provided material for an appealing tableau of the incumbent, which edged out opportunities for any talk about the challenger--whatever his name was. That's the emotional energy fueling the distrust of the relationship, but the bromance also threatens to be a stand-in for larger doubts about Christie's ideological core. Specifically, conservatives distrust Christie's support for the Second Amendment and his embrace of Medicaid expansion as a part of President Obama's Affordable Care Act. There is also likely to be a general suspicion of a popular northern Republican. ""If you're up by 30 points as a Republican in New Jersey, you're probably doing something parts of the Republican base won't like,"" says one veteran Republican operative. So Christie might need a cleansing break. But moving away from Obama would be nearly impossible. It's not just that there are hours of footage of him with President Obama acting like chums. He can't distance himself from Obama because doing so will destroy his essential characteristics as a straight shooter who can get things done by working with the other side. Besides, the last GOP nominee spent his campaign trying to wiggle around the unappealing aspects of his career as a governor and it didn't work. Instead, what Christie will do is make the case for compromise as he does so often on the campaign trail. His presidential candidacy will fall directly in the fault line of the current larger Republican debate over how you balance principles with pragmatism. Can you work within the system, making compromises and occasionally embracing the enemy, or should the next leader of the Republican Party be pure, representing a clear contrast to the opposition? The Obama-Christie relationship presents a number of ways to test what's durable and what's fleeting in politics. Bipartisanship only seems possible these days after a disaster. Once the plywood is off the windows and the chimney is back up, political players revert to form. Will that be true in this case? For Obama, the trip is supposed to turn the page after a few bad weeks. It allows him to talk about the economy, show government doing useful work, and remind people of his bipartisan tendencies. Some analysts are claiming it will help the president move on from the controversies that have befallen him. Christie should hope this punditry is true. If the White House controversies about which everyone has been so obsessed can be dispatched with such ease, Christie will have no problem moving past whatever baggage he may have from his relationship with the president. It'll be as easy as throwing a football through a tire."	When Will Gov. Chris Christie End His Obama Bromance?
2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/05/boy_scouts_keep_ban_on_gay_adult_leaders_the_bsa_s_new_policy_will_fail.html	"In a clear effort to appease a divided membership, the Boy Scouts of America has voted to change its national policy on homosexuality: It will now allow gay youth to become and remain scouts, but it will still ban adult leaders ""who are open or avowed homosexuals or who engage in behavior that would become a distraction to the mission of the BSA."" A spokesman told me the focus is on youth so as to ensure that the Scouts can ""provide kids a place to belong while they learn and grow."" Some will view the policy change as progress, which it certainly is for the estimated tens of thousands of gay boy scouts who will finally feel a sense of belonging that was needlessly denied them before. But this modicum of progress virtually dries up when you consider what those same boys will face as they age out of the Boy Scouts: a giant slap-down for anyone wishing to become a Scout leader, with the attendant message that, while being a gay kid is now sort-of OK, being a gay man is still shameful. How is that a place for gay kids to ""belong while they learn and grow""? But the real problem with the Boy Scouts' new policy is the same problem the military suffered with its ""don't ask, don't tell"" compromise: It leaves the organization with a discriminatory policy that literally has no rationale besides the whim of opinion surveys and the vague sense that even talking about gay things is somehow untoward. To officially allow gay scouts while explicitly banning ""open or avowed"" gay adults sets up a climate of dishonesty and deception, a kind of ""don't ask, don't tell"" for the post-DADT era. It's a badge of dishonor that will cling to the Boy Scouts for quite some time. ""Don't ask, don't tell"" was formulated 20 years ago, which raises an obvious question: Why would any organization implement an outdated and spineless policy two full decades after the military tried the same, faced ridicule, found it a failure, and killed it as the 21st century began to leave it behind? As was said then about ""don't ask, don't tell,"" a policy that takes baby-steps forward while reinforcing groundless and increasingly unpopular discrimination is in many ways worse than a policy that just lingers on the books through inertia. It tars the organization as out of step and just plain mean-spirited. I asked the Boy Scouts of America repeatedly for an explanation for why it would remove the ban on gay scouts but continue the ban on openly gay adults. But there isn't one. Like ""don't ask, don't tell,"" the Boy Scouts' policy is a compromise measure--devoid of all principle--that bows to opinion polls, fears, and the yelps of religious conservatives. Boy Scouts spokesman Deron Smith took strong exception to any inference (such as my own) that the focus on banning adult leaders implied a belief that gay men are prone to molesting boys, and he cited academic experts refuting that notion. His only explanation for the distinction was this wholly empty assertion: ""By reinforcing that Scouting is a youth program ... this resolution rightly recognizes there is a difference between kids and adults while remaining true to the long-standing virtues of Scouting."" Like the debate over gay troops, the debate over gay scouts has involved breathless assertions that ending discrimination could prompt a mass exodus of members who would bolt in protest. According to a voting member information packet designed to help members decide how to vote, ""Many religious chartered organizations stated their concern is with homosexual adult leaders and not with youth."" The groups, according to the packet, estimated that a policy welcoming both gay youth and adults ""could cause the BSA to incur membership losses in a range from 100,000 to 350,000."" This argument perfectly echoes claims in the lead-up to ending ""don't ask, don't tell"" that 500,000 U.S. troops could resign in protest, decimating nearly a quarter of the force. As I've explained elsewhere, research shows that opinion polls surveying anticipated reactions to minority rights are terrible at predicting actual behavior, serving instead primarily as an outlet for expressing protest. And if that predictive research wasn't persuasive enough, recent research I conducted and wrote about in Slate showed that despite predictions that half a million troops would leave if the ban ended, only two service members actually quit. Of course, it's no coincidence that it's religious groups that are sounding this alarm the loudest, as their real objection to gay Boy Scouts is that it violates their beliefs, not that it will have a quantifiable impact on the organization. And this points to the real problem with the Boy Scout's new ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy: No one has been able to provide an actual reason, beyond a vague allusion to personal beliefs, for discriminating against gay people. That is, no one has been able to answer the spot-on question of a recent book: What's wrong with homosexuality? Virtually every instance of anti-gay discrimination--access to marriage, military service, government employment, religious practice, the psychiatric profession--has justified itself by pointing to some alleged secondary effect of homosexuality, from national security risks to threats to the family to angering God. Not so discrimination by the Boy Scouts, who--almost admirably if you're going to discriminate--simply stated their belief that homosexuality is inconsistent with the Scout duty ""to be morally straight and clean in thought, word, and deed."" But now that equation has been removed, with a new policy reflecting a belief that gay youth can be ""morally straight."" Where does that leave gay adults, who most gay youth become? The Boy Scouts' strange new policy makes an untenable distinction between the morality of gay boys and gay men, which reflects a defining feature of homosexuality in 21st-century America: that it's virtually the only thing people seem content to call immoral without ever explaining why. The Boy Scouts' half-step forward is certain to keep the debate alive, with increasingly negative attention likely focused on the organization. If that debate does anything positive for our culture, perhaps it will be putting a renewed focus on this important but neglected question: What, in the 21st century, does it mean to be ""morally straight""? The Boy Scouts owe America an answer."	Why the Boy Scouts' Policy on Gay Leaders Is a Spineless Disgrace
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/05/new_england_town_halls_these_experiments_in_direct_democracy_do_a_far_better.html	"We tend to ignore local government until something goes wrong--municipal bankruptcy, perhaps, or unplowed streets after a mishandled blizzard. Turnout in local elections is notoriously low, and attendance at city-council and school-board meetings is usually negligible. Most Americans have become accustomed to putting our communities in the hands of a few purported experts and leaving well enough alone. So when I moved to a small town in Massachusetts last summer, I was surprised to learn that I would have the chance to be part of an experiment in direct democracy that dates back nearly 400 years. My town of Westborough (and hundreds like it across New England) is governed by town meetings, a system in which citizens act as their own legislature, coming together to deliberate and vote on everything from whether to buy the police department a new cruiser to how to zone for medical marijuana dispensaries. I had spent years covering municipal governments as a newspaper reporter, and I had seen the infamous ""town hall"" meetings at which Tea Partiers berated members of Congress in 2009. Those partisan spectacles, at which discussion of President Obama's health care bill routinely devolved into chaos and name calling, exhibited the worst side of our system of government. When I decided to attend my own town meeting, I was expecting either a raucous free-for-all with anti-tax tirades or a boring procedural with bad coffee and a handful of elderly or pensioned regulars. It was neither. Town meetings are the last vestige of true direct democracy in the United States, and about as close as you can get today to the sort of government practiced by the Greek city-states that invented the form 2,500 years ago. Early New England settlers, whose quotidian affairs lay beyond the control and attention of the British crown, formally adopted town meeting as early as the 1630s, and that apparently gave them a taste for democracy. While some founding fathers saw the town meeting as taking things a bit too far--James Madison wrote, ""Had every Athenian citizen been a Socrates, every Athenian assembly would still have been a mob""--it's clear that town meetings served as early inspiration for the American Revolution. In my middle-class town of 18,000, the meeting was held this spring in the high school's cavernous auditorium. The atmosphere was festive, and in the hallway outside the Westborough Women's Club ran a bake sale, with proceeds from their banana bread and maple syrup muffins going to a local food pantry. The gym was turned over to a free childcare operation, with moon bounces and craft tables. When townspeople signed in, they received strips of mint green copier paper to hold aloft so volunteers called ""tellers"" could count the vote. Majority ruled, except in the few cases where a two-thirds vote was necessary. Few measures were controversial, so it was usually easy to gauge whether a motion carried by eyeballing the sea of green. Some 450 people packed the auditorium at the height of the meeting--a small percentage of registered voters to be sure, but then again, they were being asked to do more than just mark a ballot. Town meetings consist of two four-hour sessions, with a two-hour dinner break in between. One long-time attendee told me that the meeting frequently required a third session the following week to complete all the scheduled business. It's not quite government by the people--it's government by the people who are willing to sacrifice a weekend. But the people who came had come prepared. They had pored over the budget and done their research and, in some cases, their own math. They came armed with numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and news about neighboring towns' property tax increases. In a country where just over one-half the eligible population can't even be bothered to vote for president, it was incredibly heartening. My fellow townspeople were also polite, organized, and respectful of one another. As a troop of Boy Scouts rushed around with portable microphones, voters patiently waited, hands raised, for their turn to speak. Unlike in Washington, there were no shouting matches, partisan sniping, or attempts to filibuster. It was in stark contrast to the way we've become accustomed to seeing our elected representatives behave--especially at the national level, where Congress has become less a deliberative body than a den of acrimony, contempt, and brinksmanship. Today, with the sequester a fact of life, the stock phrase ""do-nothing Congress"" carries real implications for people's everyday lives. But the citizens of Westborough were making decisions without dragging things out--allocating funds for roadwork and police cars, rejecting a proposed cap on future property taxes. Perhaps there's something to be said for citizen legislators, who can't spend months bickering because we have real jobs to go to on Monday. We were also deliberating on issues that would have an immediate effect on our lives--our property taxes, our police, our roads. You can't really have a ""do-nothing"" town hall meeting. That would never fly. The most controversial item on Westborough's agenda was the school budget. The volunteer finance committee wanted to lower it roughly $200,000 below what the volunteer school committee requested. A citizen spoke up and offered his own even lower number, and we debated the three proposals for the better part of an hour. Arguments weren't based on ideology but on how the school budget fit into the town's goal not to raise spending by more than 2 percent, and how our spending on special education compared with that of neighboring towns. When the debate heated up, the finance committee chair urged us to remember, ""In the end, we're all part of the same town."" The school committee's budget passed, with 63 percent of the vote. New England-style town meetings have changed little since the 1700s--aside from that fact that women and minorities are now invited. But they never really caught on elsewhere, and their survival today can likely be attributed to New Englanders clinging stubbornly to a strong regional identity. Unfortunately, town meetings are endangered as municipal populations grow unwieldy and increased mobility erodes institutional memory. Many towns today are unable to muster a quorum, and with a smaller proportion of voters attending, some have argued that open town meetings are not sufficiently representative. Some places are trading town meetings for the typical mayor and city council arrangement. That's a shame, and not just because town meetings are a form of democracy older than America itself. It's a shame because of how well they work, even in this age of hyper-partisanship. Perhaps that's because we're facing our neighbors, or because what's at stake is smaller and easier to understand than the federal budget. It's also true that Westborough, more than 75 percent white and relatively well-off, is not exactly diverse. (Then again, neither is Congress.) But while town meetings aren't perfect, they do show that it's possible for a group of people to come together, discuss vital issues, and in a handful of meetings vote to raise or lower their taxes without so much as a salty word. That's a lot more than the ""professionals"" in Washington can say. Correction, May 22, 2013: Because of a production error, a photo caption in this article misidentified the town hall of Plymouth, N.H., as the town hall of Plymouth, Mass.

4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/05/tea_party_paranoia_rising_conservatives_remain_convinced_barack_obama_played.html	"At noon on Tuesday, at the urging of the local Washington, D.C. Tea Party, nearly 100 activists gathered on the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the IRS building. Down the road to their left was Capitol Hill; up the road to their right was the White House. The media-to-protester ratio clocked in at a robust one-to-five--the industry standard. The paranoia quotient was unusually high. People who had shown up outside the IRS, bureaucrats occasionally glancing down at them, were shy about revealing their identifies. A half-dozen activists, happy enough to talk, would only give me their first names. Another man walked the perimeter wearing a paper bag with holes cut out for visibility: His ""mask of intimidation and fear."" And another activist, a man wearing a T-shirt with the visage of the late Andrew Breitbart, briefly argued with a cameraman--""film my shirt, not my face""--before wrapping his head in a green scarf. That didn't matter, because the Tea Party was back. The IRS scandal that broke on May 10 has cultivated new, justified paranoia about the federal government. It's been showing up in the polls. The new Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 40 percent of voters ""support the Tea Party movement,"" up from 32 percent last year. Independents supported the Tea Party by an 8-point margin; they used to oppose those guys, 44-34. The downside, which only broke through the fog today, is that revitalized conservatives might have to settle for a small victory. Tying Barack Obama's White House to the IRS scandal has become comically difficult. Oh, sure, there's plenty of tape of the president attacking right-wing tax exemptions, and letters from Democratic senators asking the IRS to investigate that. ""Under a Democratic administration,"" explained National Review's Kevin Williamson last week, ""the IRS was under pressure from Democratic elected officials to investigate political enemies of the Democratic party. The agency did so."" This is a young scandal, sure, but thus far that ""pressure"" hasn't surfaced. The inspector general's report nearly ruled it out, reporting that the Be On the Look-Out document that gave agents the anti-Tea Party guidelines was baked in-house. ""We asked the Acting Commissioner, Tax Exempt and Government Entities Division; the Director, EO; and Determinations Unit personnel if the criteria were influenced by any individual or organization outside the IRS. All of these officials stated that the criteria were not influenced by any individual or organization outside the IRS."" With that one paragraph the (Bush-appointed) inspector general gave the Obama administration and its flacks a Cloak of Deniability. They've donned it every day. What started as a question of whether the White House ordered ""Tea Party targeting"" has become a Byzantine investigation of on what day which staffers were informed that the inspector general was digging into this. Originally, Jay Carney said the White House knew about the results ""weeks"" before the May 14 release of the report. Then he admitted they knew about it on April 16. This is the sort of Encylopedia Brown what-did-he-know, when-did-he-know-it investigation that looks devastating for the administration until the story is buried alive under timelines and digressions and denials. Conservatives have started to adapt, deploying two simultaneous, only somewhat contradictory arguments. No. 1: Obama has been caught out as a ""bystander,"" presiding haplessly over a reckless state, learning of its abuses when he puts down the teleprompter and picks up a newspaper. No. 2: This wasn't the only abuse of taxing/investigative power in the first Obama term. Perhaps the president was behind one of those? It's worth their asking. On the right, stories of IRS terror are percolating and getting treated seriously again by Republicans. Frank VanderSloot, a health supplies magnate who donated to Mitt Romney's super PAC, had blamed Obama for a surprise 2012 audit. He's back, asking someone to find out why the IRS was so curious about his money. And he's not half as compelling as Catherine Engelbrecht, a Texas manufacturer who went on to found the ""voter integrity"" coalition True the Vote. She was hounded not just by the IRS, but by OSHA regulators, by inquisitive FBI agents, and--complicating the Obama narrative a little--the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. On Tuesday morning she teamed up with Sen. Jon Cornyn for a conference call on her struggle. On Tuesday afternoon, she sued the IRS. It's like an unexpected law of physics: The Obama administration slips away from the scandal and the IRS sinks further in. On Tuesday afternoon the Los Angeles Times reported that lie-prone IRS tax-exempt organizations director Lois Lerner would show up in Congress but plead the Fifth. Instantly, Lerner became the great public villain of the scandal, a damage-conscious figure in an increasingly disgraced organization. But conservatives want and expect this story to run through the White House. At the IRS rally, as a George Washington impersonator posed in front of the agency's brutalist sign for a succession of TV cameras, activists withheld their names and asked me why the president wasn't being blamed for the scandal. ""They could have a picture of Obama killing puppies and they wouldn't believe he was really killing them,"" said ""Beth C,"" a middle-aged activist whose red shirt portrayed a screaming eagle superimposed on an American flag. ""Or they could have a picture of him eating the dog,"" joked ""Melinda,"" cradling one of the ""Audit the IRS"" signs waved during the brief rally. ""Exactly,"" laughed Beth. ""Eating the dog!"" They were sharing an in-joke, a reference to the fact that young Barack Obama ate ""dog meat"" while he lived in Indonesia. That anecdote thrilled conservatives, from the jungles of blog comments to the heights of the Romney campaign. Yet it never really wounded Obama. This was getting to be a pattern."	Why the Tea Party Is Getting More Paranoid By the Minute
5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/05/e_w_jackson_virginia_gop_s_choice_for_lieutenant_governor_why_his_nomination.html	"On Sunday afternoon, standing outside the Virginia GOP's headquarters in vote-rich Fairfax County, Bishop E.W. Jackson finally became a real politician. He'd just won his party's nomination for lieutenant governor. Democrats and the press, dazzled by their luck, had just started digging into Jackson's YouTube record of incendiary quotes. Jackson asked his fellow Republicans to join him in a belly laugh. ""I was just quoted in the Huffington Post today, because the long knives have already come out,"" said Jackson. The crowd took its cue, and booed. ""They quoted me, and they said, just listen to what he said last night! 'We've got to get the government off our backs, off our businesses, out of our families, out of our way.' And they thought that was terrible. We think it's great!"" This was true, in the most misleading way possible. The Huffington Post had just run an SEO-optimized piece about Jackson, and its aggregation machine had grabbed that generic Tea Party quote from Jackson's Saturday speech at the Virginia GOP convention. That quote was filler. The story had led with a 2012 video of Jackson calling for blacks to bolt the ""Democrat Party,"" because ""Planned Parenthood has been far more lethal to black lives than the KKK ever was,"" and continued with a 2010 Jackson essay exposing how Barack Obama ""sees the world and Israel from a Muslim perspective."" Jackson was spinning those Republicans in Fairfax. He'd just become this year's Michele Bachmann, this year's Christine O'Donnell, a goateed content mill for liberal blogs and oppo researchers. It's an off year, and Virginia's one of only two states electing a new state government in 2013, so, yes, the media's going to pay attention to the YouTube preacher. Anyone who doesn't currently live and vote in Virginia should have two small questions. 1)  How did Jackson get this nomination? 2) What do I care who the lieutenant governor of Virginia is? So let's go in order. Jackson's victory was preordained 11 months ago, when the state GOP announced it would hold a convention, not a primary, to pick its next candidate. Virginia voters don't register by party; it's hard, but doable, for a moderate to win a primary by appealing beyond the base. Conventions, in Virginia and anywhere else, empower the activists who care enough about their party to spend a weekend in an air conditioned arena waving Gadsden flags and poster board campaign swag. No moderate can win the nomination at a Virginia convention. The party's decision meant that Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, the hero behind the Obamacare and climate change lawsuits, would be the party's candidate for governor. Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, an occasionally-moderate Republican who'd spent two terms in the low-profile job, briefly flirted with a third party bid, then thought better of it and just kept sniping at Cuccinelli. Meanwhile, waiting to take advantage of all this was E.W. Jackson. The bishop of Exodus Faith Ministries fit an archetype that's done spectacularly well in the Obama era--the well-credentialed black Republican with the golden voice. Jackson had a law degree from Harvard, a series of radio shows, and a deep moral disquiet with his father's political party. ""I had a crisis of conscience in the late 1970s,"" he would write in 2012. ""Massachusetts Democrat Barney Frank was pushing the homosexual agenda. How could I, as a Christian, be committed to a party led by Mr. Frank? In the end, I could not. My desire to be in a right relationship with God and my faith was greater than my desire to be approved by my father, my family, or the black community."" Starting in 2009, Jackson was getting noticed by TV bookers and Tea Partiers for being quick to condemn social liberalism or anything that whiffed of ""race-baiting."" He read Bible verses outside the Department of Justice ""to test the limits of the expanded federal hate crimes law""--the DOJ passed the test and didn't arrest him. He'd issue press releases on the letterhead of his STAND America PAC (it never raised more than five figures) and ask why the Obama administration had sued Arizona over its 2010 immigration law but didn't prosecute two members of the New Black Panther Party who'd stood outside a (mostly black, heavily Democratic) Philadelphia polling place. ""This administration,"" he said, ""has called the people of Arizona racists. Since they are willing to throw that accusation around, they ought to also answer for their own apparent anti-white racial bias."" In Virginia, all of this made Jackson a star. He'd take the stage at Tea Party rallies to condemn the Obama administration and--this was always popular--shame anyone who called the Tea Party ""racist."" In 2011, after the movement had probably crested, Jackson ran for U.S. Senate. To a novice, who might judge a candidate on criteria like ""money raised"" and ""votes won,"" the campaign was disastrous. Four candidates fought for the nomination. Jackson ran fourth, with less than 5 percent of the vote. That was after running a Web video in which a Tea Party activist in Revolutionary garb handed him a red, white, and blue ax, which Jackson used to chop watermelons symbolizing ""unemployment"" and ""Obamacare."" You might watch that and think you see a candidate embarrassing himself, but that wasn't what Jackson was doing. His audience was conservatives. They adored him, because who else could get away with this stuff? ""Liberalism and their ideas,"" Jackson wrote, ""have done more to kill black folks whom they claim so much to love than the Ku Klux Klan, lynching, and slavery and Jim Crow ever did."" He'd repeat the sentiment at Republican dinners, before or after a soliloquy on the president's false Christianity or phony patriotism. ""We can send him back to Chicago or Hawaii or Indonesia or wherever he's comfortable,"" said Jackson at a February 2012 GOP dinner, ""but he's leaving the White House!"" Democrats have hours upon hours of this material to play with, and they'll try to hot-glue the best stuff to Cuccinelli himself. Democrats win in Virginia, in off-years, when they convince suburbanites that the GOP has lost its mind. They will point out that the lieutenant governor, rather unusually, has real clout in Virginia at the moment. The state Senate is evenly split between the parties, and the state's second-highest ranking official gets to break the ties. Bolling provided key votes on a tax-hiking transportation plan and a voter ID bill. Jackson repeatedly told Republican activists why Bolling was wrong; if you'd have put him in the chair, he'd have sided with hardcore conservatives. A month ago, before the party took him seriously, Jackson gave a long interview to an Internet radio host named Anna Yeisley, and told her that the lieutenant governor's office would offer him even more than the vote. He'd approach it as a ""platform to move this commonwealth into a conservative, constitutional direction when the legislature is not in session."" Before the Virginia GOP nominated Jackson, its delegates heard from Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. The term-limited governor, a potential 2016 candidate, had spent the early part of the year traveling to state party events and giving a speech about the lessons of its last defeat. The chief lesson: Enough with the gaffes, already. ""We must stop being the stupid party,"" said Jindal in the stump speech. ""It's time for a new Republican party that talks like adults. It's time for us to articulate our plans and visions for America in real terms. We had a number of Republicans damage the brand this year with offensive and bizarre comments. We've had enough of that."" After a while, Jindal dropped that line. He didn't recycle it in Virginia. Why would he? What were the odds that his party would keep re-living that screw-up?"	Why Did Virginia Republicans Nominate a Crazy YouTube Preacher?
6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/05/steven_miller_house_testimony_the_irs_has_many_more_liberals_than_conservatives.html	"Maybe it wasn't the best idea for acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller to resign before talking to Congress. He appeared before the House Ways and Means Committee on Friday as a sort of human sacrifice; the first bureaucrat to resign in the scandal, and not even the one Republicans or Tea Partiers wanted. Miller had been a deputy commissioner during the years of scandal, and the IRS inspector general's report didn't tie him to any bias or malfeasance. ""I resigned,"" he shrugged, ""because as the acting commissioner, what happens in the IRS, whether I was personally involved or not, stopped at my desk."" He wasn't fighting for his job, which freed him up to be the most unsympathetic public servant not currently employed by a North Korean prison. Republicans insisted that the IRS had ""targeted"" Tea Party groups when they applied for tax exemption, because the Inspector General (sitting right there in the room) had said so. Miller kept quibbling with the word ""targeted."" Republicans asked if the 501(c)(4) follow-up questions were criminal; Miller called them ""bad customer service."" Miller confirmed that the Treasury Department was made aware of the letters during the 2012 campaign, without quite appreciating why this made Republicans turn such a vibrant shade of red. ""Nothing bad is going to happen to you,"" said Rep. Tom Reed, a ruddy, low-profile former mayor from western New York. Miller, for some reason, saw an opening for some snark. ""Nothing bad is happening to me, congressman?"" Reed snapped right back at him. ""You're getting paid for being here today, right?"" he asked. ""Right,"" said Miller, thoroughly defeated. It was an ironic little exchange. For the moment, both of these men still work for the government. (Miller won't actually leave his post until June.) One of them keeps his job by convincing conservative-minded voters in Corning, Orlean, and Pittsford, N.Y. to send him back to Washington. One of them was a civil servant. Nobody in politics appointed him to the job he's leaving. The president can hire and fire IRS commissioners, but the people below him--the people fingered in the IG report, from D.C. to the fabled Cincinnati office--work their way up the ladder regardless of who the president is. In theory, the civil-servant structure should make an organization less prone to an eruption of bias or of hive-mind behavior. But that's not how it works. Liberals are more likely to enter the civil service, and to stick to it, than conservatives are. And why not? Conservatives want to shrink the size of government; Republicans have negotiated deals federally, and in the states, that slashed or froze the size of the bureaucracies. Ron Swanson aside, the public sector is no place for a libertarian. Every single number proves this. Tim Carney has collected the campaign finance figures for IRS employees nationally and in the Cincinnati office. In the past three election cycles, IRS workers donated $247,000 to Democrats and $145,000 to Republicans. In Ohio, the number was skewed even further--75 percent to Democrats. According to a 2011 Gallup poll, around 40 percent of unionized federal employees identified as Democrats; only 27 percent identified as Republicans. State and local government employees are far more likely to be Democrats than Republicans. If you check the timing of that poll, you realize something about how obvious this all is. Gallup went into the field to quiz bureaucrats because Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker was rolling back collective bargaining rights for state employees. Doing so, as Republicans knew, would weaken a constituency that was inclined to vote for Democrats after filling their campaign accounts. Now, does that excuse the IRS's behavior in what Tom Reed called ""Tea Party-targeting-gate?"" No. It explains the behavior. In the IG report, you encounter bureaucrats presented with a challenge--""some organizations were classified as 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations but operated like political organizations""--and responded by drafting a ""Be on the Look-Out"" (or BOLO) memo with some anthropological advice about conservatives. Any application with ""Tea Party,"" ""Patriots,"" or ""9/12 Project"" in the name was flagged, as was referring to ""government spending, government debt or taxes."" And this, as Doug Donovan reported, was before the surge in 501 applications really got going. Based on what we know about the sort of people who aspire to become IRS commissioners, how much direct knowledge did they probably have about the conservative movement? How much did they fear it? So far in this story, Republicans have raced to find answers tying low-level IRS behavior to directives from the Obama administration, or table-pounding from Democrats who were worried about 501s like American Crossroads or Americans for Prosperity. But you don't need to make that leap to explain why civil servants working for a tax-collection agency--the very heart of the Leviathan--might have been extra-skeptical of conservative groups. Republicans have been clever in their response to all that. Led by Rep. Tom Price in the House and Sen. Dean Heller in the Senate, they've called for the IRS to be stopped from enforcing ""Obamacare"" regulations. They received a remarkable gift horse on Thursday, when--after six days!--ABC News noticed that the former director of the IRS's tax exempt division, Sarah Hall Ingram, was the current director of Affordable Care Act enforcement. By Friday morning, conservatives were asking Hall Ingram to be fired. Let's say that her superior did let her go. Her likely replacement, the sort of person who'd spent enough time in the bureaucracy to be qualified, would be someone committed to the health of the state. What Republicans need, in the long run, is either a much-reduced government or a surge of civil-servant Ron Swansons."	Does the IRS Have a Liberal Bias? Of Course.
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/05/barack_obama_benghazi_cover_up_white_house_emails_don_t_reveal_evidence.html	"I was told there was going to be a cover-up. After reading the 100 pages of emails related to the Benghazi media talking points, I'm hard-pressed to find evidence for the most damning accusations against the president and his staff. If they were involved, they were once again leading from behind. The most incendiary charge aimed at the president is that, in order to insulate himself in an election year, he and his team made up a fake story about a ""spontaneous uprising"" in Benghazi and downplayed intelligence that it could have been a premeditated attack by known terrorist organizations. There has been so much spinning from the president and his staff in the aftermath of the attack, this storyline seems possible--when the public spin is this bad it is easy to imagine deeper rot. The emails help your imagination along. They destroy the impression left last November by White House spokesman Jay Carney that only a single word was changed in the process, which can get your adrenaline up. But when you pull on the thread in search of evidence for the Big Story, your heartbeat slows. The emails show a lot of CIA and State Department action, but comparatively little White House meddling, and certainly nothing near the level of meddling that would be required to put in the big fix. One of the challenges of figuring out what's a cover-up, what's a lie, and what's just spin in this Benghazi drama is that this entire discussion is about media talking points. Talking points produced to guide members of Congress in their conversations with the media are not the product of sodium pentothal. They are created to put the best face on an event and to coordinate spin so that everyone in the administration, campaign, or party caucus has the story straight. That means if you don't see bureaucratic ass-covering and efforts to make the interesting appear bland, you're not reading talking points. So, for example, when House Speaker John Boehner and President Obama have a contentious meeting, their aides agree on talking points in which they tell the media the two men had a ""frank exchange."" Not a lie, but not an expletive-laden transcript either. In this case, the talking points were being created on the fly as information was coming in about the attack and an investigation was underway. So, in addition to the normal massaging of language, there was a good deal of imprecision, too. Given that context, what do the emails tell us about the Obama election-season cover-up story? First there is the matter of the ""spontaneous demonstration"" that ignited the violence. The president's critics contend that the Obama team put United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice on the Sunday talk shows to promote a false story about a link between the violence in Benghazi and the demonstrations in Cairo over an anti-Islamic video. If this were true, it would indeed make the whole business a cover-up. Talking points may not be suitable for stone tablets, but you're not supposed to actually lie. But the one thing that is consistent throughout the talking-point editing process is the very first sentence of the CIA assessment: ""The currently available information suggests that the demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo."" There is no mention of a video in the talking points, which Rice brought up on television that Sunday, but the video was the pretext for the Cairo protests. (You may remember that before the State Department was covering its behind about the Benghazi attack, it was doing so over the Cairo embassy apology for the video.) In 1992, if you'd talked about the riots in Los Angeles it would have been reasonable to refer to them as the riots that were based on the Rodney King video. Let's not fixate too much on the video, though. It's less important to the cover-up narrative than the idea that the attack was a spontaneous event. What administration critics find risible about the reliance on the video is the thinking behind it: that this level of violence could ever be considered spontaneous. Fair point, but that's a problem with the CIA's first assessment, not evidence that supports a White House cover-up. The cover-up story relies on the premise that Obama administration officials pushed the idea of spontaneity in order to obscure the fact that they had missed warnings of planned terrorist attack. It's plausible that someone was pushing that story for parochial reasons in these email exchanges. Perhaps the CIA put that idea in its first assessment and kept it there in every subsequent version to cover for its failure to stay on top of the al-Qaida affiliates in Benghazi, even though there was a CIA outpost there. It's also obvious that the State Department wanted to shift blame away from its failure to protect its people in Benghazi. But there's no evidence in the emails that the idea of spontaneity was initiated by anyone associated with Obama, the White House, or the president's wider political fortunes. Did Obama benefit from the spontaneity narrative? Yes. But to embrace intelligence from your CIA that is favorable to you--when you have no reason to doubt your intelligence service--is not the same as making up a false story. It's not even a sin. Next we come to the claim that the president and his team removed the references to al-Qaida and other terrorist organizations as well as references to prior warnings about terrorist activity. If this were the case, you would expect to see some effort by the White House voices in the email traffic toward this goal. It's not there. The opposite is the case. In the initial round of emails, one CIA official reports that the White House signed off right away on the full initial CIA assessment. ""The White House cleared quickly, but State has major concerns,"" reads an email that a CIA official sent to CIA director David Petraeus. So rather than being the authors of the bowdlerizing effort, the White House was just fine with the fully caffeinated version that mentions Ansar al-Sharia, al-Qaida, and that the CIA had produced numerous warnings about extremists in Benghazi. White House aides reviewed the talking points, made no substantive changes, and moved them along. When the language does eventually change in the talking points, it is clear that it is at the behest of State Department officials, not anyone in the White House. When Obama's aides do come on stage, it's pretty far in the background. One State Department official writes, ""Talked to [NSC spokesman] Tommy [Vietor], we can make edits."" This is hardly the vision of a campaign-obsessed Obama operation pushing a storyline. There have been some sloppy Nixon analogies thrown around this week, so let's remind ourselves for a moment of what a real cover-up sounds like. ""I don't give a shit what happens,"" President Nixon was recorded saying. ""I want you all to stonewall it, let them plead the Fifth Amendment, cover up or anything else if it'll save it--save the plan. That's the whole point. ... We're going to protect our people, if we can."" Aides to Republicans pushing for additional investigations concede that the leaked emails don't show much White House involvement. That takes the heat off of Obama and puts it on Hillary Clinton--who was always an ancillary target of the Benghazi inquest. In congressional testimony, Secretary of State Clinton said, ""It was an intelligence product,"" referring to the talking points and adding later that the ""intelligence community was the principal decider about what went into talking points."" That doesn't stand up now that we can see how thoroughly the State Department was reworking the language. The original talking points authored by the CIA were wrong about the spontaneity of the uprising, but they substantiated the idea that there was a broader terrorist threat on the ground. The final product that informed Susan Rice's talk show appearances was both wrong and bland. What's clear from the email exchanges is that the State Department insisted on the changes for a mix of ass-covering and self-defense reasons. Victoria Nuland, the State Department spokesperson, didn't want to give Congressional critics talking points that could be used against the State Department. That would no doubt please her former boss, Vice President Dick Cheney, who had a very stingy view about what Congress had a right to hear when it came to national security matters. Cheney was among those this week pushing the idea that the president concocted the story of a spontaneous riot to protect his election chances. That the CIA analysts fed the president intelligence that turned out to be imprecise would no doubt be insufficient for the former vice president, though Cheney had a similar experience. He cites the CIA as the source of his long-held incorrect view that Iraq played a role in the 9/11 attacks. (If he weren't on the other side of the ideological divide, perhaps he and the president could commiserate over how hard it is to get a story straight.) Just because there's no real evidence of the grand White House conspiracy doesn't absolve the president of responsibility for the underlying failures and the shoddy efforts to explain the whole affair. From his first remarks in the Rose Garden, to the exchanges in the debates with Mitt Romney, to the present day, the president has been shading and back-dating what he said shortly after the attack to make it seem like he was aware it was a planned attack when at the time he was encouraging the view that it was a spontaneous one. That's spin and it's lame, but it's a present-day failing unconnected with White House actions last fall. So the president and his aides are guilty--guilty of doing a bad and misleading job of explaining why there was no cover-up. But that's not the smoking gun Republicans set out to find."	Where is the Benghazi Cover-Up Republicans Promised Us?
8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/05/barack_obama_scandals_the_white_house_faces_controversies_over_benghazi.html	"If you find yourself panicking about the thick cloud of scandal snaking around the Obama administration, don't. Sen. John McCain has good news for you. ""When Iran-Contra was going on, President Reagan was still able to work with Congress,"" said McCain to Capitol Hill reporters today. ""Legislation was passed, et cetera."" That scandal captivated Washington and the world, and ""everyone thought that it would damage President Reagan, but it didn't."" There, isn't that soothing? Three stories, doing varying amounts of damage, may only add up to the same Richter scale score as the story that nearly destroyed the Reagan presidency. The invincible Republican investigation of Benghazi, the IRS's early admission that it hassled Tea Party groups, two U.S. attorneys' snooping into Associated Press phone records--it's all being rolled together into a grand narrative of presidential crisis. In his weekly chat with reporters, Democratic House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer confused the IRS story and the AP story, answering one with his talking points for the other. He apologized. Then he did it again. That, obviously, is not the way to handle this. Yes, the overall impression of crisis is affecting the mood of Congress. Many pundits are resurrecting the musty meme of the ""Second Term Curse,"" but that's a little easy--any government in power gets weaker as it gets older. A better term is ""Omnishambles,"" a situation that looks ""shambolic from every possible angle,"" because the individual angles actually matter here. The three scandals are placing different amounts of pressure on different parts of the government--and in one case, on different parties. I've gone ahead and ranked them in ascending order of political devastation. #Benghazi--It's only really damaging to one party, personified by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, and to an astonishing degree it hasn't broken out of a partisan prism. Rasmussen Reports, a polling firm that fairly often bears good results for Republicans, found that voter outrage and awareness of the story (from the attack to the increasingly Pynchonesque story of administration talking points) didn't change after last week's hearings. Republicans keep asking for a special congressional committee to be formed and tackle the scandal. Democrats keep ignoring them. That stasis, oddly enough, can help the administration inch toward one of its goals. Two of the co-sponsors of the Senate immigration bill, Lindsey Graham and John McCain, are two of the sharpest-speared Benghazi obsessives. The focus on one has a sort of matador effect, distracting angry conservatives from the other. I saw this firsthand in Arizona recently, when an audience at a McCain town hall alternated between angry immigration questions and angry Benghazi questions. ""What has helped me back home is that people remember the Lindsey from impeachment, they remember the guy who was leading the charge on conservative caucuses,"" Graham told Politico last week. ""[Benghazi] and the second amendment stuff, that's where I can throw a punch."" ""This hurts the Obama Administration more than similar issues hurt the Bush administration because a central underpinning of the progressive philosophy is a belief in the efficacy of government,"" said Paul Begala, a former adviser to Bill Clinton. ""Perhaps in some sort of bank-shot way it may give cover for some Republicans to work with him on immigration ... but in the main almost all of the Obama agenda requires expanding folks' faith in government, and these issues erode that faith."" AP-aquiddick--Least damaging of the three, but with no upside, unless it's used to build steam for a new shield law. Its origins lie in a different scandal, one that broke out when Republicans fretted that national security secrets were being leaked in a selective way that benefited Barack Obama's re-election. The response, eventually, was an investigation outsourced from the Justice Department to two U.S. attorneys. That led to the secret subpoena of AP phone records, when federal regulations call for rather more transparency than that. But the origins of the story matter. Republicans today, like South Dakota Sen. John Thune, were happy to snark about the ""most transparent administration in history,"" but they didn't elucidate any problems with an investigation. McCain, to pick an example of someone who'd been critical of the leaks, didn't weigh in on the ""scandal"" side of the story when reporters asked. IRS-gate--This is a Wes Craven nightmare for Democrats, with no clue of when they might wake up. Just on Tuesday, a pugnacious Missouri reporter claimed that he'd been ""hammered by the IRS,"" Franklin (son of Billy) Graham said his charity had been hassled by the IRS, and the National Organization for Marriage announced it would sue to find out how its own documents got leaked. None of these stories had anything to do, directly, with the Tea Party story. The floodgates just opened for them. Republicans are riding the waves, claiming that the IRS can no longer be trusted on a job they never wanted it to take. Which job? Why, enforcing the Affordable Care Act, what else? ""When people apply for the exchanges, and they send the information off on this application, it goes to the IRS and to Homeland Security and to Social Security,"" said Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, a medical doctor who ranks fourth in the GOP's leadership. ""The IRS is asking for up to 15,000 more agents to enforce the individual mandate, which people don't like, and to decide on tax credits. So when we see unequal application of the law under the IRS, I think that just brings another dark cloud over the entire health issue. I believe many people are not going to go to the exchanges. I believe it's going to be a train wreck for a number of reasons, but I don't think people are going to want to send information to the IRS when they hear about this abuse of power. People weren't happy to send that information even before this!"" Democrats have fought the current, asking everyone to look at the reason the IRS was leaning so hard on the Tea Party. A series of Supreme Court decisions loosened the rules governing tax-exempt 501(c)(4) groups. Over the past decade, those groups grew into behemoths that used large untraceable donations to wage campaigns--sorry, to educate Americans--in the interest of social welfare. That, say Democrats, was the problem the IRS was grappling with, and wouldn't it be better to just tighten the rules that created it? That was Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's argument on Tuesday, as he mocked the idea of Karl Rove as a ""social welfare"" promoter. Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden argued that the scandal should make skeptics look again at his Follow the Money Act, co-written with Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski. ""These problems can take root in the absence of clear and enforceable rules,"" said Wyden. ""If you don't have clear and enforceable rules, the bureaucracy makes it up as it goes along."" If you want to push it, there's one more possible liberal upside. The last time a Democratic president looked to be brought low by scandal was 1998. It was a brief economic golden age, a perfect time for entitlement reform. Republicans spent the year impeaching Bill Clinton for lying about a sexual act. Progressives remember this moment with a strange fondness. Would-be compromisers remember it acidly. As she headed into meetings on Tuesday, Maine Sen. Susan Collins was talking to reporters about the possibility of a grand bargain on entitlement spending, something to replace sequestration cuts. I asked whether the new scandals would up-end that. ""I do not believe that the IRS scandal,"" said Collins, ""serious and troubling though it is, will forestall negotiations on the budget and immigration and other issues."" That's the spirit!"	How the Obama Scandals Could Save Immigration Reform And the Welfare State

He started a business. He raised a family. Then came 2009 and the Obama presidency, and he discovered politics from the couch of his Portage County, Ohio, home. ""Quite frankly my wife and I were apolitical people,"" he remembers. ""Glenn Beck was on TV, and we were learning things we didn't know. There was a Tea Party rally scheduled in Cleveland, and the local media was bagging on them. If nobody showed up at the rally, it really would have hurt, you know? So we called every registered voter in Portage County, and people showed up."" One meeting at a Cracker Barrel later and boom, a local Tea Party group was born. As it grew, it got happily ensnarled with politics. ""We were handling money,"" says Zawistowski. ""We were taking bus trips. We talked to lawyers, and they told us that we'd have to apply for 501(c)(4) status,"" which would make the Portage Tea Party a charitable organization. ""We filled out the 1024 forms, like we were supposed to. We were supposed to hear back in 90 days."" Thus began the saga that would, incredibly, make the universally despised Internal Revenue Service even more despised. Zawistowski was one of many amateur Tea Party activists who applied for tax exemptions and received lengthy questionnaires, containing up to 55 questions  about possible political activity, asking them to prove that they were clean. According to an Inspector General's report, due this week but leaked to the Associated Press, dozens of groups with ""patriot"" or ""Tea Party"" in their names were given the same Room 101 treatment. Zawistowski, who's now with the Ohio Liberty Coalition, has been busily sharing the letters the IRS was sending around. All of them were sent long after the groups asked to be considered. ""We contacted them in 2010,"" he says. ""The first we heard from them was in a letter dated January 25, 2012, asking for the answers--get this--by February 16.""  Toby Walker, performing the same task for the Waco Tea Party in Texas, says it took ""eight to 10 months"" to answer all of the questions. That's easy to believe. A typical letter looked like the one sent to the Ohio-based Liberty Township Tea Party--35 questions, most of them with multiple sections. Question 3: ""Provide details regarding all of your activity on Facebook or Twitter."" Question 5 asked for biographies of ""each past or present board member, officer, key employee, and members of their families,"" to check whether any of these people might run for office, or might have filed a 501(c)(4) request for somebody else. Question 12 asked for a tally of all activity ever engaged in by the group, by percentage, adding helpfully that the ""total of all activities should equal 100 percent."" Question 34 asked for ""copies of articles printed or transcripts of items aired"" if the Tea Party had been covered by the media. ""I've got to write this down when we're done, write down that I talked to you,"" laughs Tim Savaglio of the Liberty Township Tea Party. ""We have to submit this interview to the IRS, for approval!"" And that was a standard demand, from letter to letter. There's nothing shocking about a new organization jumping through flaming hoops in order to win tax-exempt status. What's shocking is the timing and the IRS's odd focus on these conservative groups. To a man, small-scale Tea Party organizers report a very slow approval process taking place through most of 2010 and 2011, followed by an early 2012 letter making two or three dozen asks. The existence of those letters was reported at the time and flagged by Republican members of Congress. Why wasn't that controversial at the time? You could blame a pliant media, or you could point out that Democrats had been talking openly about the need to crack down on political groups that won 501(c)(4) status. In 2010 and 2012, the White House and Democratic groups warned voters that these groups were hoarding money from secret donors. Americans for Prosperity, chaired and funded to some degree by David Koch, won tax exemption in 2004 and went on to spend tens of millions of dollars on campaign ads. In their yearly reports, this wasn't campaign money; it was money spent to ""educate U.S. citizens about the impact of sound economy policy on the nation's economy and social structure."" The IRS didn't investigate Americans for Prosperity. According to Politico's Ken Vogel and Tarini Parti, it didn't even call them.* Instead, it issued those letters to Tea Party groups. If there was a strategy, if the IRS was responding to calls from Democrats to crack down on nonprofit politics, it may have been to get at the big guys by nailing the pygmies. On Monday, AFP provided a redacted letter sent to one Tea Party group that asked (in Question 6) for copies of ""any contracts"" or ""training material"" the group had exchanged with the Koch's Death Star. And that's giving the IRS an awful lot of credit. The agency's infamously better at nailing small-time scofflaws than nailing the ones that can hire top attorneys. Maybe it was just following the usual script. The Richmond (Va.) Tea Party, one of the fastest-growing groups of the movement's early days, spent at least $15,000 on attorney's fees even before the giant questionnaire arrived. ""Because of what the Richmond Tea Party went through, other Tea Parties were very conscientious about forming a different path,"" says Jaime Radtke, who led the Richmond Tea Party for a few years before leaving to run for the U.S. Senate. ""Imagine that people are donating to a group because it may become a nonprofit. What happens at the end of the day if it isn't approved? Are we obligated to turn the donors' names over, after they thought they were confidential? Are we going to have to all of a sudden file back taxes?"" Actually, the Richmond Tea Partiers passed their test. So did the Waco Tea Party. These were sweet victories. They pale next to the victory the IRS just handed the Tea Party--a yearlong, real-time campaign to prove that they were right about the government. It's dumb and lumbering, and it's out to get them. ""When the American people read the questions that were asked of these liberty groups,"" says Tom Zawistowski, ""they will be outraged. They will bring up the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. Those are the closest examples. That's how bad this is."" Correction, May 14, 2013: This article originally misspelled Tarini Parti's last name. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"	The IRS Just Handed the Tea Party Its Biggest Victory Yet
10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/05/jason_richwine_hispanics_and_iqs_the_heritage_foundation_scholar_began_researching.html	"Update, May 10, 2013: On Friday afternoon, after this story had already been published, Jason Richwine resigned from the Heritage Foundation. Four years ago, long before he'd join the Heritage Foundation, before Marco Rubio was even in the Senate, Jason Richwine armed a time bomb. A three-member panel at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government accepted Richwine's thesis, titled ""IQ and Immigration Policy."" In it, Richwine provided statistical evidence that Hispanic immigrants, even after several generations, had lower IQs than non-Hispanic whites. Immigration reformers were fools if they didn't grapple with that. ""Visceral opposition to IQ selection can sometimes generate sensationalistic claims--for example, that this is an attempt to revive social Darwinism, eugenics, racism, etc,"" wrote Richwine. ""Nothing of that sort is true. ... an IQ selection system could utilize individual intelligence test scores without any resort to generalizations."" This week, Heritage released a damning estimate of the immigration bill, co-authored by Richwine. The new study was all about cost, totally eliding the IQ issues that Richwine had mastered, but it didn't matter after Washington Post reporter Dylan Matthews found the dissertation. Heritage hurried to denounce it--""its findings in no way reflect the positions of The Heritage Foundation""--and Richwine has ducked any more questions from the press. His friends and advisers saw this coming. Immigration reform's political enemies know--and can't stand--that racial theorists are cheering them on from the cheap seats. They know that the left wants to exploit that--why else do so many cameras sprout up whenever Minutemen appear on the border, or when Pat Buchanan comes out of post-post-post retirement to write another book about the ""death of the West?"" Academics aren't so concerned with the politics. But they know all too well the risks that come with research connecting IQ and race. At the start of his dissertation, Richwine thanked his three advisers--George Borjas, Christopher Jenks, and Richard Zeckhauser--for being so helpful and so bold. Borjas ""helped me navigate the minefield of early graduate school,"" he wrote. ""Richard Zeckhauser, never someone to shy away from controversial ideas, immediately embraced my work."" Yet they don't embrace everything Richwine's done since. ""Jason's empirical work was careful,"" Zeckhauser told me over email. ""Moreover, my view is that none of his advisors would have accepted his thesis had he thought that his empirical work was tilted or in error. However, Richwine was too eager to extrapolate his empirical results to inferences for policy."" Borjas' own work on immigration and inequality has led to a few two-minutes-hate moments in the press. He wasn't entirely convinced by Richwine, either. ""I have never worked on anything even remotely related to IQ, so don't really know what to think about the relation between IQ, immigration, etc,"" Borjas told me in an email. ""In fact, as I know I told Jason early on since I've long believed this, I don't find the IQ academic work all that interesting. Economic outcomes and IQ are only weakly related, and IQ only measures one kind of ability. I've been lucky to have met many high-IQ people in academia who are total losers, and many smart, but not super-smart people, who are incredibly successful because of persistence, motivation, etc. So I just think that, on the whole, the focus on IQ is a bit misguided."" But Richwine had been fascinated by it, and for a very long time, in an environment that never discouraged it. Anyone who works in Washington and wants to explore the dark arts of race and IQ research is in the right place. The city's a bit like a college campus, where investigating ""taboo"" topics is rewarded, especially on the right. A liberal squeals ""racism,"" and they hear the political correctness cops (most often, the Southern Poverty Law Center) reporting a thinkcrime. I saw this for the first time in 2006. During the backlash to the McCain-Graham immigration bill, the young paleo-conservatives Marcus Epstein and Richard Spencer founded the Robert Taft Club, a debating society that would welcome taboo ideas and speakers. They did so, and the SPLC then branded them ""hateful""--it was the way of things. But I'd sometimes attend those events, as a reporter. In 2006, they invited American Renaissance founder Jared Taylor to a debate on race and conservatism. Years later, a few reporters condemned James O'Keefe because he'd been in the room. They botched the story, accusing O'Keefe of planning the event, when he'd merely shown up. The lesson everyone took away from this? Well, of course the left would blow up anything you said about race into a controversy. That was no reason to stop doing it. Richwine either relished in the controversy or didn't care. In 2008, while at the American Enterprise Institute, he joined a panel discussing a new book from Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies. ""Decades of psychometric testing,"" said Richwine, ""has indicated that at least in America you have Jews with the highest average IQ, usually followed by East Asians, and then you have non-Jewish whites, Hispanics, and then blacks. These are real differences. They're not going to go away tomorrow."" Even in that room, conservatives tried to distance themselves from Richwine's remark. ""It's looking at America in 1965 and assuming that's what we always were,"" said Krikorian. Even Richwine added some caveats. ""I point out that Ayaan Hirsi Ali was given an IQ test in the Netherlands and did very poorly,"" he said. ""[It's] hard to imagine someone brighter."" But Richwine was winning fans on the nativist right. Marcus Epstein was in the audience, asking a question, then writing the event up favorably at the anti-immigration site VDare.com. Over the years, VDare's Steve Sailer would point to Richwine's work and charts to reveal cold truths about racial IQ differentials. In March 2009, he shared Richwine's calculations ""from the 2003 New Immigrant Survey of the backward digit span subtest from the Wechsler IQ test."" Immigrants from Mexico had IQs, on average, 18 points lower than those of white Americans. Throughout 2009, Sailer pointed readers to Richwine's research on IQ and crime rates. He doesn't recall whether he talked to Richwine personally, but Richwine never really put up a wall between his work and the endorsements of nativists. While at AEI he got to know Richard Spencer, the other Taft Club founder, and another thinker who laughed at the constant denunciations of ""hate watchers."" In 2010, as first noticed by Yahoo News' Chris Moody, Richwine wrote a couple of pieces for Spencer's new white nationalist magazine Alternative Right. His debut story demolished a piece by the pro-immigrant legalization conservative Ron Unz. ""His reason is superficially plausible--the sole offense of some Hispanics in federal custody may be an illegal border crossing,"" wrote Richwine. Alas, as numbers from the Bureau of Justice Statistics would prove, ""Unz is wrong when he says that Hispanics are no more criminal than whites. Hispanics are, in fact, substantially more likely than whites to commit serious crimes, and U.S.-born Hispanics in particular are about two and a half times more likely."" At his day jobs, on the mainstream right, Richwine wasn't usually this blunt. He might cite the Bell Curve in an article for AEI's magazine, but there was no thinkcrime there--he'd thanked Charles Murray in his dissertation. When he joined Heritage, Richwine wrote only rarely about immigration, applying his statistical acumen more often to public pension crises and student loans. ""His mistake is that he wrote about a taboo subject,"" Charles Murray told the New Republic yesterday. ""And to write about IQ and race or ethnicity is to take a very good chance of destroying your career. And I really hope that doesn't happen."" It's happening right now. According to Politico, Heritage is on the hunt for a PR guru who might spin away the Richwine story. On the paleo right, that's being interpreted as a nolo contendere admission of thinkcrime. VDare's writers have defended Richwine as a statistician whose work people prefer to hyperventilate about than to debunk, because they can't debunk it. ""The forces of orthodoxy have identified a heretic,"" wrote John Derbyshire, who was laid off from National Review last year after writing that he'd educated his children about racial differences. ""They're marching on his hut with pitchforks and flaming brands. The cry echoes around the Internet: 'Burn the witch!' "" Anyone could have predicted it. Richwine didn't mind taking on taboos or talking to taboo people. That's how immigration reform foes talk amongst themselves. That's not how they're going to stop the bill. ""In my estimation, our School gives too much emphasis on moving from findings to policy implications in scholarly work,"" said Harvard's Richard Zeckhauser. ""In many cases, merely presenting the facts would be a preferable way to go. That makes it much harder for one's opponents to dismiss what you say, or to accuse you of manipulating facts to reach policy conclusions. Moreover, I believe that policy conclusions usually rest on one's underlying values. If one complements one's empirical assessments with values issues, those assessments get questioned, particularly if one addresses a controversial realm of policy, as Richwine surely did in his dissertation. In many contexts, one's work will have a long run greater influence on policy if the facts are left to speak for themselves."""	Why Wasn't the Heritage Foundation's Jason Richwine Smart Enough to Listen to His Friends?
11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/05/mark_sanford_returns_to_congress_the_former_south_carolina_governor_defeated.html	"MT. PLEASANT, S.C.-- The people who believed in Mark Sanford started arriving before 7 p.m., parking their cars with varying degrees of legality and then walking into Liberty Tap Room. Sanford's campaign had commandeered the entire bar, putting up spray-painted SANFORD SAVES TAX $ signs in the corner where the candidate would speak and turning all the TV channels to the local news. The first results, displayed on a small ticker below that night's episode of Jeopardy, gave Democrat Elizabeth Colbert Busch a narrow lead. How could this happen? For a brief and worried moment, I hear all the theories. Shirley Rabens, a retiree and activist with the Charleston County Republicans, picks over some shrimp from the buffet and bemoans the money and volunteer strike teams sent by national Democrats into her corner of South Carolina. ""It ought to be against the law to send people down from Washington to run a campaign like this,"" she seethes. ""This is a local election. This is for us to decide."" To be fair to Charleston-area Democrats, they felt that way, too. When I'd touched base at the ""Elizabeth"" party (by the end, everyone was using her first name, or ""ECB,"" or occasionally ""Lulu""), I found a family reunion of beaten-down low-country liberals who hadn't held a congressional seat here since Jimmy Carter and hadn't won any GOP seats in 47 attempts. A capable soft jazz band played as Charles Smith, who'd made a couple of failed attempts for the seat in years past, told me how he'd organized ""the fundraiser that Elizabeth said she liked the best."" But we'd felt doom in the ether, so I--like the other national ""parachute"" reporters--had driven over the bridge to the Sanford party. There, the worry and regret lasted only as long as the first vote counts in the precincts which were breaking against them. Tiny Edisto Beach seemed to have gone to sleep on Republicans, with a huge fall-off from 2012, and the first votes from somewhere in Charleston had Colbert Busch up by 18 points. Then the suburban vote came in. A cheer went up as the little ticker--it was below The Voice now--recorded a 51-49 Sanford lead. By 8:02 p.m., an hour after the polls closed, votes were rolling in from Charleston. The Democratic lead there, the only thing that could have kept the race close, was collapsing. Those in the know were finally partying. I'd wanted to refresh a micro-buffet of fried delights for a few reporters who were, like me, working on the tavern's porch, so I joined the queue right in front of a white-haired Mt. Pleasant poll-watcher named Roger O'Sullivan, who'd been working ECB's home precinct. ""What's the percentage of the vote we got?"" he asks. ""Somebody have an iPhone?"" I have an iPhone and do O'Sullivan's math: Sanford got 861 of 1492 votes, a 58 percent blowout where his opponent lived and slept. ""You know what did it?"" asks Sullivan. ""I did 24 mailings in this area. Turnout was up. That was all my mailing. It was tough. It said what needed to be said, you know: Do you want to see Nancy Pelosi back GMAC? Government loans, Fannie and Freddie? Well, you've got to vote. And it worked. I spent $600 on it, so it better have worked."" The agreed-upon take on an election calcifies about as fast as the votes are counted. A week ago it wasn't at all clear that Sanford could simply remind voters that Colbert Busch was a Democrat, and that they didn't really like Democrats, and that this would be enough to win. After 8 p.m. Tuesday, the fellowship of reporters who'd parachuted in and the local wags who'd been covering the race were involuntarily mind-melding. Wow, she was a lousy candidate, wasn't she? ""She was fine in the debate, but she never went from good to great,"" says Will Folks, the editor of FITSNews and a man still most famous outside the state for claiming to have had an affair (before she won) with married South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. ""I kept waiting for her to shift into a second gear--good answer, OK, now finish the point! She never did. She never came up with an issue that would separate her from national Democrats."" He shakes his head, not really out of sympathy for the candidate, more out of respect for the deceased. ""They had this. They really had it and they threw it away."" At 8:32, the official calls start coming in, and energetic young volunteers in blue blazers flit around to spread the news. Near our press table there's a deafening roar: ""YAAAAAHOOOO! CHARLESTON HELD THE LINE!"" The screamer is Ed Evans, a 22-year Marine Corps veteran who made ""a lot of damn phone calls"" for Sanford. He turns toward a bank of a dozen TV cameras. ""Tell the world, Charleston HELD THE DAMN LINE!"" Evans slaps backs and apologizes for his volume. He's just thrilled, he says, because he ""didn't come back from the Marines to deal with this chicken shit""--i.e., watch Sanford lose. ""None of these Republicans in D.C. will hold the line, but we're sending in Mark Sanford. We sent a message to the world tonight!"" ""The whole country is watching us,"" chirps Charles Morgan, a retiree who says he made 500 election-day phone calls for Sanford. As the crowd presses closer, and the heat and sweat grow harder to ignore, the conversation turns to ""the message."" The election obviously won't be seen outside this room as a victory for conservative values. No, it was Act 17 or Act 20 of a soap opera. And that's fine. Let the people outside this room misunderstand Sanford's personal journey. ""Of course he's not perfect,"" says Evans. ""There was one perfect person, and they put him on the cross."" Paula Viel joins the conversation by mocking all the ""tweeters"" spending the bitter night joking about Sanford. ""They lost and they're angry,"" she says. ""Ohhhhh, they're tweeting? Let 'em tweet, tweety birds!"" Finally, close to 9 p.m., Sanford emerges in the hot balcony of the bar. He slowly, carefully navigates a path down the narrow stairs that will take him from there to the camera set-up, the place with all the wooden signs. When he gets there, he grabs an overturned buffet pan and hoists it triumphantly, and the crowd reacts instinctively, passing it back like we're at a Bouncing Souls show and some straight edge kid has jumped off the stage. Eventually Sanford realizes that the pan was there for him to stand on--""I need the pan back!""--and it returns, and he starts his speech. ""Some guy came up to me the other day,"" says Sanford, ""and he said, 'You look a lot like Lazarus."" ""Rose from the dead, baby!"" yells a woman in front of me. ""If it was just about market-based ideas and limited government,"" says Sanford, ""this campaign would have been easily won long ago. But I had deficiencies, that were well-chronicled, as a candidate."" He thanks his staff, including some long-defeated primary opponents who've been walking around the party, and then starts to preach. ""I want to publicly acknowledge God's role in all this,"" he says. ""Not that he said, 'You're it,' but what he said was, not that you'll win, you'll learn."" Sanford thanks his ex-wife, and he thanks his mistress-turned-fiance, who's right there in view of the cameras, then he remembers the ""angels"" he met on the trail, like a woman in Edisto Beach who'd ""had a health scare, and she'd had a chance to work at the convenience store,"" and by extension taught him the value of appreciating what you have. ""I think she was an angel,"" says Sanford. ""The number of people who God brought up with me, with God's grace, have been angels."" This is a speech for believers, not tweeters. Don Fort, a volunteer wearing a gray T-shirt with the slogan PRAY, VOTE, PRAY, waves his hand in the air, as if Sanford's giving a sermon--which, to be honest, he sort of is. It takes ages for the crowd to break up. Sanford will end up staying at Liberty until midnight, talking to anyone--reporter, fan, whoever--with a glass of water in his hand. Maria Belen Chapur--Sanford's Argentine fiance--sticks around too, pinned for a while between the exit and the men's room, where a succession of Sanford reporters--mostly male--meet her and get photos taken with her. I walk past her as one donor in a pinstriped suit gushes that the Sanford-Chapur affair is ""the great romance of all time,"" and she poker-faces her way through it, as a photographer lurks waiting to get a picture of her with Sanford. It seems wise to give them some space, so I end up talking to John Reese, who runs a mobile dental care outfit. Sanford, he says, once contacted him from the governor's office to ask whether a bill would impact the dental business. ""I said it would,"" says Reese, ""so I basically helped a bill get vetoed. Now, how many politicians do you know who would do that? I only know one."" What's a nice way of asking the next question? How about: Can Sanford be effective in Congress this time around, given the story that made him infamous? ""I don't know if you're a Christian or not,"" says Reese, ""but I can think of a couple guys in the Bible that had some failings. David being one, he turned out OK. Paul, another one, killed more Christians than anybody. He was an expert in the law, and he killed Christians. Moses killed somebody too, and he did OK."" ""And Mark Sanford didn't kill anybody!"" says John's wife, Katie. ""Grace has got to be part of life, or you couldn't work with anybody."""	Mark Sanford Sees God's Hand in His Political Redemption
12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/05/chris_christie_had_lap_band_surgery_was_the_new_jersey_governor_s_decision.html	"Chris Christie underwent lap band surgery over President's Day weekend because the three-day weekend gave him time to recuperate, and because no decision he makes can be free of some connection to the presidency. The New Jersey governor checked in for the weight-loss procedure under an assumed name and he was out later that Saturday. He only told his chief of staff. He informed the rest of his staff yesterday--along with the New York Post. According to Christie, the procedure, which restricts the amount of food he can ingest, was a personal health decision. After turning 50, he worried that he might not live a full life on his current trajectory. According to an aide, his doctor told him pointedly that it was an issue that would catch up with him soon. Since last fall, he has been contemplating the surgery. Responding to hurricane Sandy got in the way and delayed the procedure. There is no reason to think that personal health was not Christie's driving motivation, but it also helps his presidential chances if he decides to run. If a candidate is any good at all, they endure a long period where the moves they make to position themselves for the presidency are indistinguishable from those they would make for other reasons. That's true more broadly of Christie's re-election campaign and his second term. Running as a can-do politician who can hammer out hard compromises with Democrats is both his pitch to New Jersey and his pitch to the nation. There is now a weight-loss tradition in the run for the presidency. Former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour said that if people saw him lose 40 pounds it would either mean that he was running for president or he had cancer. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee made his weight-loss the foundation of his campaign in 2008. He dropped 110 lbs, and pounded away on creaky treadmills all across Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina to show that he was keeping up. When Huckabee started to fill out the talk show host's chair in 2011, it seemed clear that his presidential ambitions had taken a back seat to his gastronomic ones. Christie has always treated his weight with the bluntness he applies to everything else. In the 2009 gubernatorial race, his opponent John Corzine ran an ad attacking Christie for ""throwing his weight around"" as a U.S. Attorney. The spot featured Christie disembarking from a suburban and accentuated the undulations of his locomotion. Christie shot back: ""Man up and say I'm fat."" David Letterman has made Christie's weight a constant source of comedy, so Christie went on Late Night and brought a donut. Christie has said the issue is ""fair game,"" but he did react angrily to Michael Kinsley's argument that Christie's weight made him unfit for office. ""The people who pretend to be serious commentators who wrote about this are among the most ignorant people I've ever heard in my life,"" Christie said. Presidential candidates have to be careful about admitting weaknesses. It's a shame because the good ones are the products of their struggles as much as their triumphs. But in the modern campaign you're only allowed to admit that you're too humble or too generous--faults that are actually attributes. Christie's weakness was there for all to see. If he runs, the issue would be a distraction--talking about it on Oprah only gets you so far. It's still OK to make fat jokes in America, but it wouldn't just be the comedians talking about it. If Christie decided to run, you can bet that cable television news stations would have used the Kinsley argument to air endless chin pulling discussions about the meaning of Christie's weight. The mix of politics, weight-loss, and self-help would be irresistible. If only a religious angle could be found, everyone would get a bonus at the end of the year. At 5 feet 11 inches Christie is the exact height of our fattest president, William Howard Taft, and Christie was on track to surpass Taft's top weight of 335 pounds. In the age before television, it was easier to be large (just as it was easier to have bad teeth, as this picture of Presidents Taft and Wilson demonstrates). Taft's admirers equated his size with power. ""It is good to see Big Bill Taft enter a room after a number of other men. He reminds you of a great battleship following the smaller vessels, coming into port with her brass bright and plowing deep,"" swooned newspaper editor Arthur Brisbane. But Taft also endured a lot of jokes. During a debate over whether the president should have an official automobile, a member of Congress said, ""The incoming president proposes to abandon horses for reasons that the gentleman well knows: He does not wish to violate the law against cruelty to animals."" Taft, who reportedly once got stuck in a theater chair and a White House bathtub, joked about his weight as Christie does. After he lost the election, Yale offered him a Chair of Law at the university. Taft replied that a chair would be too small, but ""it might be all right"" if they could offer a ""Sofa of Law."" The last modern president to struggle with weight was Bill Clinton whose fondness for junk food made him the butt of jokes and offered a polite way to talk about his other appetites. He was most famously lampooned in a Saturday Night Live skit which portrayed a trip to MacDonald's in which Clinton meets voters and eats all their food. His opponent Jerry Brown had fun with it in the 1992 primary. The Los Angeles Times asked readers to offer tips to help him thin down. Columnists offered views on the issue. Family Circle ran an article designed to help him get healthy. In the White House, Hillary Clinton enlisted heart doctor Dean Ornish to revamp the presidential menu. They replaced hamburgers with soy burgers and served stir fry vegetables with tofu and salmon with vegetables. It didn't work: Clinton gained 20 pounds. Clinton is now in trim shape. His heart scare and a new vegan diet have combined to make him look leaner than ever before. From now until Christie makes his ultimate decision about running for president, he will have to endure punditry about two kinds of numbers: his poll numbers and his weight. This too is a distraction, but on the whole, it at least allows him to play both the role of Everyman struggling with weight as well as a problem solver doing something about it. The lap band surgery, according to one source, takes about three years for the patient to reach his or her lowest weight. That means it will be fully paying off just before the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries. Another coincidence, no doubt."	Is Chris Christie Slimming Down for the Oval Office?

""I do my best thinking in the morning,"" he explains. The early morning is also when he usually gets an audio tape intercepting chatter between U.S. border patrol agents, which he edits for public consumption. He always uses this information to plot a map of border crossings. Spencer's group, American Border Patrol, will release all of this online. I wake up at 4 a.m. in the ""Coronado house"" that Spencer opens for visitors to his 104-acre property on the U.S.-Mexico border. The property abuts a border fence that sinks 6 feet into the ground and shoots up 18 feet above it. I got there at sundown the day before, which meant turning off Arizona State Route 92, past a wary border patrol agent, and driving five miles of dirt roads past dozens of ranches.* All of them sport sturdy fences around the dirt and brush. Many of them are for sale. Years ago Spencer bought this compound from one of those sellers, a retired colonel who couldn't put up with the drug cartel shootouts. Four years after the construction of that fence, there aren't any shootouts. It's a ""gated community,"" a ""little Shangri-La,"" says Spencer. The rehabbed guesthouse sits in front of a landscaped pond, and Spencer keeps a sound system and laptop outside, piping jazzy covers of pop-rock hits. At night the only light comes from the stars, the Mexican mining town of Cananea, and from a border patrol floodlight so intense you could sit on your porch and read by the glow. But this isn't what wakes me up. Spencer owns seven German Shepherds, and some of them have started howling for attention. At 7 a.m. sharp, Spencer drives from his place to the guesthouse on an ATV. Seventy-five years old, with the cheerful look and vocal rasp of Santa Claus in some Rankin/Bass animation, he speculates that the dogs staying with him were disagreeing with the dog staying with me. The dog that spent the night in my quarters is covered in black-and-white spots and named Migra--as in la migra, immigration police. ""She doesn't get along with the others,"" says Spencer. Spencer, who has devoted the last 20 years of his life to the immigration wars, kicks his doors wide open for the media. When the Southern Poverty Law Center designates you ""anti-immigrant"" and a ""vitriolic Mexican-basher,"" what choice do you have? He's showed up to legislative hearings in Phoenix and Democrats have walked out. He's been in touch with the office of his congressman, Democratic Rep. Ron Barber, but apart from that he's ""persona non grata."" So he talks to the press--and, he says, to defense contractors. Spencer initially invited me to the border to watch a trial run of a new gyroscopic surveillance drone designed by his team. The nucleus of the Spencer operation is actually Border Technology, Inc., headquartered a short walk from the guesthouse (just past a horse stable), and made famous in 2003 and 2004 when it started running homemade Border Hawk planes on the American side of the U.S.-Mexico fence. Two years ago, Spencer buried seismic sensors, the kind that he used to find oil deposits in his private sector days, to test whether they could trace border movements. ""I was a good systems engineering thinker,"" he says. ""That's what I'm applying right now. Here I am trying to present technology trying to solve the border problem, and the whole thing is about what a hateful guy I am! What the hell is happening in this country?"" What Spencer thinks is happening is that waves of illegal immigrants from Mexico have weakened America, and could weaken it further. This is specifically why he bothers the Southern Poverty Law Center. In the 1990s, while living in his native California, Spencer worked to pass Proposition 187 (which denied state benefits to the undocumented), and recoiled in horror when it was stymied by politicians and the courts. He started warning of a ""Mexican takeover of the southwestern United States,"" and in 2001 he delivered a homemade video about this, Immigration: Threatening the Bonds of Our Union, to every member of Congress.* DVDs of Spencer's videos about ""Aztlan"" sit around Border Technology's workrooms, right next to the CubeX 3-D printer the company just bought, to make plastic components for the new drones. ""I moved here because it was clear that California was just gone,"" says Spencer. His old state went socialist, thanks to immigrants who grab at benefits, hospital care, and food stamps that we pay for. ""Here's a question. Why are 50 percent of the students at UCLA from Asia? Why are they not 70 percent Latinos? That's because of a different attitude [toward] education. Instead of being launched into a brave new world of science and technology, we're going backward. We keep this up, we're going to be a Third-World country--the only one with nuclear weapons. Nobody's ever thought of that? Us, turning into a third world country?"" This is rhetorical: Plenty of people have thought about that. That's why the grand project of closing down the border with technology is such a risk. The senators currently trying to legalize millions of immigrants are in on the plan--not Spencer's plan, exactly, but an impressive-sounding matrix that borrows from what we've learned in foreign wars. If they get their way, we'll have a secure border and a growing immigrant population. So Spencer and his team keep the discussion to two main topics: The reality of the border and the technology that could close it. The American Border Patrol's compound is a short walk from the border itself, separated by rough red desert, bushes, and tufts of brown grass. They estimate that the Identiseis project, the burying-sensors-in-the-ground plan, would cost $100,000 per mile. Sensors could be buried up to 6-feet deep, run on solar power--a massive green jobs initiative that tracks the footsteps of people trying to walk from Mexico into Texas or Arizona. The total price tag--maybe $200,000,000 to secure the entire border--sounds ludicrous, and apart from the defense contractor that Spencer can't name (""one of the big five""), no one could verify it, but it's roughly 5 percent of the cost of the border fence, and less than Boeing was going to ask for its own scheme--known as the Secure Border Initiative--had it actually worked before a disappointed Department of Homeland Security scrapped it in 2011. Standing on the porch as Migra trots around the yard, I get the full spiel from Mike White, Spencer's business partner and designer for 10 years, an athletic guy sporting a soul patch and wearing a polo shirt from his side job as a paramedic. ""For what we gave Boeing for that SBI disaster,"" says White, ""you could run this along the entire U.S.-Mexico border. And the Canada border. And you could take the rest of the money and retire. I don't know why they're not banging our doors down."" ""If the people who wanted legalization were thinking straight,"" says Spencer, ""they'd drive up to American Border Patrol and they'd bring out signs and start chanting. 'We want this! We need this!' They'd do that if they wanted to stop the drug trade? Right? Wouldn't they?"" White laughs. ""You wonder if they really want this secured. They land things on Mars, you know? How can they not secure our border?"" ""They can find life on Mars, but they can't find life on our border,"" says Spencer. ""If people with water bottles and a backpack with no training can walk into this country without being detected,"" White continues, ""what would stop people with guns and bombs from doing that?"" Once, to prove how bad the security truly was, American Border Patrol staged a ""terrorist"" border crossing. White created a faux suitcase nuke, put it in a backpack with a prominent nuclear symbol, and snuck across the border. Twice. Spencer gives me an ATV tour of the area they were able to sneak past, which has changed plenty. He cuts a path between two 18-wheeler-sized plywood signs: SAVE THE UNITED STATES
SECURE THE BORDER The words are spelled out by miniature American flags. Attached to each flag is a message from one of the group's donors--""Thank you for what you do"" or a quote from some patriotic text. Twenty thousand of these flags are arrayed between the full text of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and the Gadsden Purchase. ""When we get another 20,000 of these from American citizens, we need to think of a new sign,"" he says. ""Maybe: Good fences make good neighbors."" We drive on and park at the fence. Spencer happily takes credit for it: He started filming the action on the border in 2003, and by 2009, presto, contractors were putting up the rust-colored barrier. ""You can still see the flags we put on the old barbed wire fence,"" says Spencer. The new fence curves west to a low mountain range where Spencer and other watchers used to spot migrants, clambering up old mining paths on ATVs. Going east the fence tapers off, replaced by a ""Normandy fence."" It's a run of X-shaped metal girders, about five feet high, hard but not that hard to clamber over. Grazing cows meander on the other side of the barrier. More of them stroll along the shallow river where the fence stops. A border patrol agent keeps his eye on the river. He waves at us as we take some photos. When we're done, Spencer and White set up the dry run of the seismic test. The drone test won't happen, because they flew it yesterday, and after a few minutes the helicopter banked too hard and plummeted to the ground. The designers speculate that a flawed battery placement brought it down, something that can be easily fixed once they get more material for the 3-D printer. So we wait for the seismic test, as a stiff wind whips the high desert. ""Normally the sensor would work within 600 feet,"" says Spencer, ""but this might cut to 400. If it's raining, you'd see it get cut to 300."" Three of Spencer's some-time employees, including the guy who landscaped the lovely guesthouse pond, stroll out to the border fence past markers denoting every 200 feet. They wait for the signal. ""Go now,"" says White. They walk at a normal pace and barely hit the 600-foot marker before the foghorn sensor goes off. ""That's great, that's better than I thought,"" says Spencer. ""Isn't that amazing? That seismograph was buried for two years. The manufacturer says it can work for 10 years without maintenance. I'm telling you, when we have this thing ready, in another 30 days, this sensor will work and the chopper will pop up, fly, and take pictures. We will do that. We will do that."" It's time to check out of the guesthouse. I add my name to a rundown of foreign journalists, state senators, and Tea Party activists who'd stayed in the house since the renovation, and I drive to the suburbs of Tucson two hours up the road. Sen. John McCain is holding the second of two town halls in mostly-hostile territory. One high schooler asks him why we should let border-crossers become citizens ""when one in five has a criminal record."" (McCain points out that this isn't true.) But he disarms the critics. ""In Iraq, we developed incredible technology, Gen. Petraeus did, because of the IED problem,"" says McCain. ""They developed a radar which not only surveils the types of people doing things, but believe it or not, this radar tracks them back to where they came from. We need to have this radar all across our border, and the sensors and the drones, so we can assure the people of this country, the people of Arizona, that we have effective control of our border."" McCain keeps coming back to that point. Mike Wilson, an activist with the Tohono O'odham nation near Tucson, listens politely. He's ""wearing his tribal hat"" today, he tells me, but he works with the Border Action Network, one of several groups that tries to assist immigrants crossing from Mexico by leaving supplies for them in the desert. He is about as far away from Glenn Spencer's worldview as anyone can get. He supports what McCain's doing--""we need to get the immigration train out of the station."" And although he's not convinced that the militarization of the border is the answer, his nation is convinced. ""They live in fear of drugs coming across,"" says Wilson. ""I have to acknowledge that. I have to honor those fears. When I go down there and try to talk to human rights violations, they tell me: You don't live here. You live comfortably. You don't have to worry about your kid getting off at a bus stop in the desert and walking half a mile as drug cartels are moving past them."" They don't have any problem with border drones or militarization? ""They want it,"" says Wilson. Spencer wants it, too. He wouldn't mind if his technology becomes the backbone for the barrier, and he scores a contract. (""You want to know how to make a small fortune on the border?"" he says. ""Start with a large fortune."") But he's most interested in getting illegal border crossings below 20,000 per year, down from the high six figures that try crossing now. There are supporters of pure open borders, sure, but in politics there's no real disagreement anymore about locking down the border with whatever technology it takes. Either the restrictionists win, and the solution stops there, or the legalizers win, and the immigrants who've made it to Spencer's side of the border get to stay there. *Correction, May 6, 2013: This article misstated the name of the Arizona highway David Weigel turned off to get to Glenn Spencer's property on the U.S.-Mexico border. It is Arizona Route 92. It also misstated the name of the homemade video Spencer delivered to members of Congress. It is called Immigration: Threatening the Bonds of Our Union, not Bonds of Our Nation."	How Right-Wing Groups Are Waging a High-Tech War on Immigration
14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/05/obama_and_congress_should_the_president_be_twisting_more_arms.html	"You wouldn't stick a medical thermometer in a pork roast to test if it was done, and this simple kitchen rule should apply to presidential evaluations: Use the right thermometer. In a recent interview, Sen. Pat Toomey, the Republican who failed to convince his colleagues to expand background checks on gun sales, said some of those Republicans wouldn't vote for the measure because they didn't want to give Barack Obama a political win. ""There were some on my side who did not want to be seen helping the president do something he wanted to get done, just because the president wanted to do it,"" he said. The comment adds context to the ongoing discussion about whether President Obama is showing ""leadership."" Leadership is an imprecise word as it is commonly applied (as I've argued here, here, and here) and Toomey's remarks highlight one reason why: Leadership is not just about what a leader does; it's also about who he is trying to lead. At various times, the president's supporters and detractors alike have called on him to schmooze Republicans, or, if that fails, twist their arms. But can a president flatter Republican senators with dinners at swish hotels if they know they're going to get a pasting when they return home to their constituents? Can he twist arms effectively when Republican lawmakers are more scared of voters than they are of him? No harm in trying, perhaps, but to properly evaluate the gambit we've got to understand the outcomes that are even possible. And sometimes there is harm in trying. While active, public engagement from the president is crucial in some situations, in others it's the exact wrong thing to do. If a president's association with legislation makes those he's trying to convince less likely to vote for it, then a smart president shouldn't twist arms to get votes, he should fold his own and stand by. Adjusting the way we measure presidents matters because it affects policy now, will affect a president's legacy after he's left office, and will also influence how we choose his successor. Our understanding of how Obama fared in office will shape the attributes we're looking for in the next set of applicants. If a president is dunned for not leading, he gets some or all of the blame when policies get stuck. This relieves public pressure from Congress: It's not their fault for dithering, it's the president's for not prodding them into action. In the current context, the more Obama's weakness is the story , the less coverage there is of the dysfunction in the House of Representatives. Occasionally, both sides will get a share of the blame in the coverage, but the result is the same: Everyone throws up their hands and nothing gets done. In hindsight, a president's legacy tends to take into account the hurdles he faced. Presidents are praised if they try hard even when they fail. We saw a recent example of this with President Bush, whose efforts in Iraq and to reform Social Security are seen as failures. Nevertheless, he received wide praise from Presidents Carter, Clinton, and Obama for his resolve and determination at his library ceremony. So we need to try to think about the current situation the way we tend to do in hindsight--in order to more accurately understand where Obama has failed and succeeded. Did he achieve a lot under the circumstances or did he blow his opportunities? So what do Senator Toomey's remarks tell us? Presidents have long complained about the opposition blocking their agendas just because they are associated with the sitting president--Toomey's observing an old phenomenon. That said, things have gotten worse. Washington is more partisan and as Frances Lee has demonstrated, presidential leadership inherently polarizes legislators because the opposition can shape public opinion of the president by how they handle his agenda. They can make him look weak by refusing to pass his signature legislation. So the more a president meddles in Congress, the more a bill comes to be seen as his baby, and the greater chance for polarization. This view argues against the kind of muscular, public leadership many people are calling for from president Obama and the superficial LBJ comparisons. Toomey's remarks ratify the idea that it might actually behoove the president to keep his distance. Given the current landscape, a president who increases his level of meddling, schmoozing, and arm twisting in the wrong circumstances could be, and should be, judged batty. He would be proving that he is incapable of reading the moment. What this dirty window needs is another whack with the hammer. Obama has tried to adapt. For several years, in interviews with his staff as they craft the State of the Union speeches, this has been a running theme. How much can the president make a big deal about policy without fear of sinking it? That's partially why the president didn't publicly embrace Simpson-Bowles (there were other reasons) and it's what's governing his immigration work now. The president has tried to be more hands-off while the Gang of Eight does its work in order to show he understands the mess he could make of things if he meddled. This isn't to say a president should do nothing on some issues; just that he should know which ones require him to work in the background. ""Leading from behind"" is a necessary form of presidential leadership, but now it's mostly become an epithet. No one would make a film about Lincoln's passivity, though that was an essential part of his nature, and political genius. (In Lincoln we saw an attempt to convey this attribute in the brusque basement conversation between the deliberate Lincoln and the hot-headed Thaddeus Stevens, whose impatience for a reckoning with Democrats might have cost Republicans the 13th Amendment.) Whether Obama has chosen the right way to exercise this type of leadership is open to debate, but he at least has a working theory about how to apply different tactics to different situations. The problem is that we don't really have a good thermometer to measure what a president isn't doing. Rather than reading the dials on the wrong instrument, we should consider what Obama might be accomplishing by sitting on his hands."	Critics Who Want Obama to Twist Arms in Congress Don't Understand How Presidential Leadership Works
15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/05/michele_bachmann_to_leave_office_the_minnesota_republican_and_tea_party.html	"Michele Bachmann's national career has been marked by wild swings between directness and misdirection. At times, the Minnesota representative is the embodiment of Tea Party clarity. At other times, she breaks new ground minting fact-free claims that make it hard to trust politicians. One of the fact-checkers that she has kept so busy joked that her departure from Congress should be declared a national day of mourning. In announcing that she will not be seeking re-election, both of Bachmann's personalities were on display. As a political correspondent you find yourself on a lot of email lists without asking. This can be disorienting. Suddenly you are bombarded with accusations from one person about another person and you aren't familiar with either of them. It's like looking at the magazine covers at the grocery store checkout: Celebrities you've never heard of are reconciling from breakups you didn't know ever happened. In this genre, Michele Bachmann's email blasts achieved a special art. They had a peculiar mix of chatty subject lines and desperate conspiracy peddling. ""Can I mail you something?"" read the subject line from one this weekend. ""Listen to this!"" reads another recent one, which then pleaded, ""John Dickerson--Please--if you can--stop what you are doing right now and listen to my message immediately."" Another fretted, ""I need your advice ... I sent you the below email last week, and I'm concerned that I haven't heard back from you."" She's been very successful. According to the latest Federal Election Commission filings, she has more than $1.8 million in her campaign bank account. Watch Michele Bachmann's greatest gaffes: These solicitations aren't written by Bachmann, of course, but they matched her personality. They were written with the same directness that made her so appealing to Tea Party supporters. One of the laudable attributes of the Tea Party movement is the B.S. filter of its members. Bachmann knew how to channel and tap into this quality. She was masterful at capturing the anger and resentment that wells up in people when they are told what kind of light bulb they must buy. In the 2012 campaign, she wasn't afraid to take on her Republican primary rivals, most successfully calling out Newt Gingrich during one debate for repeatedly treating her like she didn't really belong there. Juxtaposed with that image of Michele Bachmann is the fuzzy, fact-free side of her on display in her departure video. Shot in front of a bookshelf to the faint strains of elevator music, it runs 8 minutes but lacks discernible nourishment.  In her emails, Bachmann's purpose is clear. Whether it's the perils of Obamacare or the Democratic machine's decision to target her, the message is unmistakable. Watching Wednesday's video roll on, it's hard to know what you're watching. It feels at once like a eulogy, a campaign video for a future run for office, and an in-flight video. (I thought any minute she'd say, ""Please be sure to comply with all lighted signs and placards."") The video is for those same people she's been bombing with regular, urgent fundraising appeals, but she never really explains her head-snapping decision to step down. She starts with a confusing numerology about her length of service in various political offices. Bachmann says she figured eight years was enough time in office. Strange, because just Friday she sent out an email asking for money for her re-election. Usually politicians break their pledge to be term-limited by deciding to stay in office; this may be the first case of late onset term limitation. She then insists that she's not leaving office because she would lose re-election or because both the Federal Election Commission and the Office of Congressional Ethics are looking into the campaign finance activities of her presidential campaign. When you build a career on being direct, it doesn't fit when you take the meandering route. At least she didn't claim she was leaving to spend more time with the family. Bachmann will serve out the remainder of her term, but the ethics committee will probably not pursue her--it has no jurisdiction over former members. That doesn't mean she won't have plenty of material to keep her busy in the next year and a half. The Tea Party is enjoying a rebirth. The IRS targeting of conservative groups ratifies its claims and worldview. The president's health care program is finally being implemented, which should offer regular opportunities for Bachmann to sound off. She's been working to repeal the law harder than perhaps any other lawmaker. That means her career in Congress may be over, but the emails aren't likely to stop."	The Two Faces of Michele Bachmann
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/05/ted_cruz_s_uncompromising_principles_the_texas_senator_s_aggressive_conservatism.html	"Sen. Ted Cruz doesn't have as many friends as he says he does. In the latest round of  Cruz's simmering debate with Sen. John McCain (who labeled Cruz a ""wacko bird""), Cruz spoke of ""my friend, the senior senator from Arizona"" while painting him as out of touch with his party and country. It usually takes a while for senators to learn how to weaponize compliments and imprecations of friendship, but Cruz is a quick study. After a patient attack on McCain's understanding of history, Cruz said: ""I know my friend from Arizona is well aware of that because he is such an esteemed historian of this body."" Like use of the word ""frankly,"" which in Washington means just the opposite, Cruz's sentence is best read in reverse: McCain is neither a friend, esteemed, nor a historian. (He is still, however, from Arizona.) Do you need friends in the Senate anymore? Ted Cruz, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah are testing this theory in new ways. The power of Tea Party activists in Republican politics, the public's low esteem for Congress, and structural changes in the Senate like the elimination of earmarks and the weakening of appropriations power have created more incentives for senators to get by without a little help from their friends. Cruz has had a series of run-ins with his colleagues since being sworn in only four months ago. He battled Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein over gun control, his Senate Republican colleagues over a threat to filibuster gun legislation; and most recently he tangled with McCain and Republican Sen. Susan Collins over budget procedure. He wears the dustups as a badge of honor. ""Count me a proud wacko bird,"" he told an approving audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference, referring to McCain's jab. There was a time when a new senator could not have survived such a controversial start. ""The making of a good senator is in some ways similar to the making of a good work of art,"" William White wrote in 1956 in Citadel: The Story of the U.S. Senate. ""There are few shortcuts."" Lyndon Johnson gave a copy of the book to freshman senators. It advised that a career rested ""upon what is slowly developing and enduring ... rather than what is quick and spectacular. Eminence may be reached by a concentration on frenetic and untypical senatorial activity, but it will never be sustained in that way."" Ted Cruz didn't read that book, and even if he did, he's decided to write his own. Though his colleagues have suggested he tone down his hard charging approach, he continues to engage with verve on multiple fronts. White's description of the Senate described the institution before an ambitious John F. Kennedy vaulted to the presidency after serving only one term, beating out Senate lion Lyndon Johnson and other Senate veterans for his party's nomination. A politician no longer had to build up a Senate career to make a national name. Sen. Barack Obama marked the final evolution of this theory. Sen. Ted Kennedy advised him to run soon lest he get too weighed down with associations to the Senate. Now Sens. Marco Rubio, Paul, and Cruz see the Senate cloak room as the waiting room to the Oval Office. Cruz's constituents at home like his brand of truth telling. They sent him to Washington to ruffle feathers. He is seen as a patriot fighting for the right cause. Fans delight in his rhetorical flourishes, like his recent comparison of Senate debate to the argument among warring factions in Gulliver's Travels over which end of the boiled egg to crack first before eating. To join a club and immediately use it as a foil is seen as bad manners by Senate veterans. To portray your colleagues as sniveling weasels is seen as bad form. And, as one longtime Senate aide pointed out, it's also probably worth pausing before telling John McCain you're the one fighting for liberty when McCain actually did. Cruz is at liberty to be himself because he doesn't need establishment Republicans; he can raise all the campaign cash he requires from the grass-roots. He doesn't need help from leadership to orchestrate votes that will help him with moderates in his state because there aren't enough moderates in Texas to make it matter. Other Tea Party favorites such as Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin take a different approach. They will both be up for re-election in blue states in a presidential year, which means Democratic turnout will be high, so they'll need all the establishment help they can get (if they don't face a Tea Party primary first). These senators are counter-examples to Cruz and company: principled conservatives who aren't irritating their colleagues. In the old Senate, Cruz would have curbed his enthusiasm because he might have wanted to bring pork home to his state and he'd need help from his colleagues to do that. Earmarks are now mostly gone. But there are still dangers lurking for Cruz and others in the purity caucus. Though Barack Obama moved through the Senate quickly, he used it as a platform for bipartisan platform building. That's what you need to do to win a national election in a diverse country. Cruz is pursuing the opposite strategy. It may win him cheers at home, but that puts him on track toward becoming this generation's Phil Gramm, the Texas senator whose effort to build a conservative platform from within the Senate made him unappealing as a national candidate. Fellow conservatives worry that Cruz in particular, and Paul and Lee to a lesser extent, are harming the conservative brand. As a talented speaker with a knack for the limelight--who is now getting invitations to key primary states--Cruz gets media attention which elevates his clashes. When he treats a respected veteran senator like Dianne Feinstein like a dope, it makes all conservatives look bad. This isn't just about image. More established Republican senators argue that there are strategic downsides to the behavior of the firebrand freshmen. During the debate over gun control, the Wall Street Journal criticized Cruz, Paul, and Lee for giving Democrats a tactical victory by threatening a grandstanding filibuster. Cruz then earned a second critique from the Journal for overplaying his role and portraying himself in a way that belittled others in the cause: ""Normally we'd ignore this insider politics, but Senators Cruz and Paul have been declaring for all to hear that they and a few others are the only conservatives of principle in politics."" The nightmare scenario that one Republican aide paints is that Cruz, Paul, and Lee allow Democrats to portray the party as hopelessly obstructionist and use it to make the public case for the ""nuclear option,"" a procedural move that would allow Democrats to override the filibuster with simple majority votes. If this extreme scenario came to pass, it would dilute the power of all Republican senators because they would effectively lose the power to filibuster. At issue in the marching career of Ted Cruz is whether nodding to the niceties of the Senate is an act of capitulation or a requirement if you are hoping to score long-term victories. I spoke to Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma this week about a wide variety of topics. He is as principled a conservative as you can find in the Senate, and he is more eloquent than Cruz about the venality of career politicians. But Coburn can also talk about the power of human relationships in politics in a way that seems antithetical to the brand of politics pursued by Cruz. ""Relationships are how deals get done,"" said Coburn, who in this case was talking about President Obama. He's been friendly with Obama since 2005, the year they both arrived in the Senate. This is a constant source of confusion for Coburn's constituents. ""The No. 1 question I get at home is: Why are you friends with Barack Obama?"" Coburn's answer, as Obama wrote in his essay about him for Time, is, ""How better to influence somebody than to love them?"" It's hard to imagine Ted Cruz talking that way."

He announced it via video, beating the tabloids' print deadlines, evading eponymous puns for one precious day. When he met the press, he juggled questions about his younger and more vulnerable days without a droplet of flop sweat. ""People may decide they want to come forward and say, here's another email that I got or another photo,"" he yawned in a radio interview, repeating a stock line. ""I'm certainly not going to do that."" Good for him and better for us, but there's still something amiss with that schlocky launch video. Weiner runs through the highlights of his 12-year congressional career, and claims he ""led the campaign for real health reform, that regular people can afford."" There's no citation, not even some footnote crediting a roll call vote or a Center for American Progress blog comment. What was ""real health reform?"" Weiner's campaign didn't clarify for me. Luckily, having been awake for much of 2009 and 2010, I recall the congressman as a frequent cable news advocate for a bill that didn't pass--single payer, Canada-style, cradle-to-grave care. Weiner even introduced a Medicare repeal amendment and dared Republicans to support it, to prove that they wouldn't ""stamp out the scourge of government-run, government-administered, single-payer health care."" So Weiner was good at wrangling press. We knew that. ""Who's better?"" he told a reporter in 2010. ""Like, why do you even walk around the room? I'll give you your money shot and you can go back and file."" That's a skill, sort of, when most members of Congress are Bergman-movie-boring. Being flashy and ineffective--actually, bragging about how flashy and ineffective you are--is strategically sound, from campaign to campaign, as long as those campaigns are directed at voters who hate Congress and don't pay a ton of attention to its mechanics. Exhibit A: Weiner on health care. The ideal Weiner bill never got a vote, and Democrats dropped it before their November 2009 passage of the ""public option"" package. The debate moved to the Senate. There, liberals were attempting to add a ""Medicare buy-in"" to the bill, letting people under the retirement age pay to enter the system. Weiner endorsed it. ""Extending this successful program to those between 55 and 64,"" he said, ""a plan I proposed in July, would be the largest expansion of Medicare in 44 years and would perhaps get us on the path to a single-payer model."" Liberals fumed, because Weiner--for what, a spot on a TV show?--had given away their blueprints. Within a week, Sen. Joe Lieberman (who'd backed a Medicare buy-in during his 2004 presidential campaign) bailed, telling reporters that ""Congressman Weiner made a comment that Medicare-buy in is better than a public option, it's the beginning of a road to single-payer."" He was spooked. Perhaps Lieberman, whose final term was a symphony of dyspepsia, was always going to cut the rug out from under Democrats. But Weiner's grandstanding didn't help. But grandstanding serves a purpose. Legislating? Tougher to say. One of the only other semi-competitive elections in America this year is the special Senate election in Massachusetts. Democrats, after some trauma and trepidation, nominated a 37-year veteran of the House, Rep. Ed Markey. Republicans passed over two relatively experienced candidates and nominated Gabriel Gomez, whose ads remind us he's a ""businessman, Navy pilot, Navy SEAL,"" and promise to support a three-pronged reform plan of term limits, ""no budget no pay,"" and banning members of Congress from ever becoming lobbyists. Two of these ideas, in practice, are hilariously useless. Republicans passed a version of ""no budget no pay"" this year, which prompted the Senate to pass ""a budget,"" which the House didn't move on. The ""ban"" on congressmen becoming lobbyists for at least two years after their term ends is easy enough to evade if, like Scott Brown, you merely join a lobbying firm and don't register as a lobbyist. Doesn't matter: Gomez contrasts his agenda with the fact that Markey hasn't passed a bill of his own in a while. ""If you're saying the longer you're down there the more effective you're going to be,"" he told a TV interviewer, ""well name me one [piece of] legislation that Congressman Markey has sponsored in the last 20 years that's become a bill."" This was brilliant jujitsu. As a Republican strategist triumphantly pointed out to me, even a reporter debunking the story had to admit that the ""assertion, read narrowly, is true."" It was true because Markey merely influenced and shaped bills that ended up being passed, with new names and bylines, in the Senate. Sure, Markey's used the telltale phrases ""fought for"" or ""campaigned for"" to beg a little credit for bills that didn't pass. But Gomez is asking voters to deny him credit for anything that doesn't bear his name, a wise bet predicated on a general disinterest on the mechanics of our hated Congress. That's sort of the point, though. Voters absolutely hate Congress. They have hated Congress for decades, with a brief, troubling pause after 9/11 when they felt a terrified flutter of jingoism. Partisans, the people who vote in primaries, react more strongly to grandstanding than to dull details like ""whether the bill passed or not."" This is the phenomenon haunting Senate Republicans. They've watched Sen. Ted Cruz and Sen. Rand Paul run ahead of party strategy, get defeated, get derided, attack the rest of the party for ""squish"" tendencies, and end up punished with more grassroots amour and media attention. ""Mr. Obama is betting the GOP keeps running into his fixed bayonets,"" sighed the Wall Street Journal's Kim Strassel, ""shouting 'repeal!' with their last, spent breath."" RedState's Erick Erickson pronounced Strassel the ""Senate GOP's stenographer."" Weiner isn't running for Senate. If he wins the mayor's office, he has more executive power than most governors or presidents. (There's no City Council filibuster to worry about.) In his 64-bullet-point manifesto he dreams of New York as a ""single-payer laboratory,"" fulfilling that crazy dream smothered by his MSNBC mid-day hits. He failed so spectacularly that he's bound to succeed. You might not believe it. You're not the average voter."	Why Anthony Weiner Wants You to Believe He Is a Hero 
18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/05/barack_obama_s_white_house_priorities_is_the_administration_setting_its.html	"When White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough told his colleagues last week to spend no more than 10 percent of their time responding to scandals, he didn't know a tornado would devastate entire stretches of Oklahoma. He knew something like it would happen though. A chief of staff knows that White House plans are always being upset, so he reminds his staff: Don't get too distracted, bigger distractions are always on the horizon. The destruction in Oklahoma brings perspective to the debate about what a president should do and when. For the last several weeks, the president's critics have been trying to get him to react to crises both real and imagined. With the Oklahoma disaster, the answer is obvious about what a president and his staff should do: all hands on deck. But how do you focus a White House when there is no clarifying event? That's what Denis McDonough was trying to do. All presidencies try to minimize the distractions. When George W. Bush came into office, his aides talked about how he would be an ""A4 president,"" meaning that is how deep you would have to page through the newspaper to read about him. He wouldn't feel compelled to participate in every story that news editors decided was worthy of the front page. His administration would stay focused on the important things. Every administration has an abstract hierarchy of priorities it tries to follow. In a world of limited resources, limited presidential time, and inevitable distractions, staff follow this general pecking order: emergencies, duty, vision, press demands, and partisan criticisms. Forces from each of these groups will try to change this order, but a successful White House keeps their eyes on the prize. This is all fine and good, but as the Bush administration learned and every administration learns, it's hard to sustain. The press and partisan critics can make those lower priorities inch up, especially if a White House is inattentive or unprepared. Right now there is a debate over whether the Obama White House has its priorities straight. Critics say items the president should be treating as part of his duty or as an emergency, like the attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya, are being blown off as a lesser-order nuisance. The president called the Benghazi talking points a ""sideshow."" White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer said much of the recent controversy--from questions about the response to the Benghazi attack to the IRS targeting of conservative groups--was the result of a Republican witch hunt. The president's critics see these responses as a part of a cover-up, but there is a difference between priorities and cover-ups. For example, on the issue of Benghazi, those who argued that evidence of a White House cover-up could be found in the talking points prepared last September after the attack lost a lot of ground last week when the emails related to the talking points were made public. But those same critics were right to be offended by the president's claim that the questions about the talking points were not a priority. They weren't a ""sideshow,"" as Obama claimed. Those talking points constituted the administration's first complete public response to the death of four citizens who were carrying out the president's policy. So the Obama team was wrong about the priority of the issue, but right about the lack of evidence of a cover-up. The IRS scandal is also a battle between priorities and allegations of a cover-up. At the moment, there is no evidence of a White House cover-up, or even involvement for that matter. Investigators will keep digging. The most important question: Who initiated the extra attention the IRS gave to conservatives? The IRS says it was a natural response to the increase in applications after the Citizens United case. But there was no such uptick. As a matter of priorities, when the IRS matter came to light, the president faced criticism that he was out of touch with the activities of his own administration. Press Secretary Jay Carney said the president had learned about it--like the rest of us--from news reports. Though members of the White House staff had known about the IRS inspector general's report detailing the abuses for a month, Carney says they never told the president for legal reasons. The White House reaction to the IRS scandal offers a classic test of the McDonough formula. The president has no control over the IRS. (In fact, it would be a crime if he did.) So calls for him to act like an action hero and storm into the IRS to clean house are illogical, especially before the official inspector general's report was published. That presumably was similar to the mindset that led to the White House staff's relaxed reaction to the IRS report when they first learned about it in April. This was a mistake. Not a cover-up, but a failure of priority management. Because it was inevitable that the reports of the IRS targeting conservative groups would explode. White House aides are familiar with the action-hero expectations of the presidency. Surely they could have anticipated that the chattering class would want action of some kind. No plan was put in place for an immediate reaction. Why does this matter? Because the lack of preparation for the predictable outcry has created unnecessary obstacles to the legitimate issues that require White House focus. With a little pre-planning, perhaps the White House aides could be spending 5 percent of their time responding to the scandal instead of 10. Various White House aides have rushed forward to explain and defend the president's inaction. He didn't react immediately because he was waiting for the inspector general to issue his formal report. Also, why should the president participate in a partisan and press circus before the facts are in? These defenses are reasonable, but ascribe too much purity to the Obama White House. When it is in the president's interest, he will embrace the circus. White House aides can be quite nimble and efficient when they want to feed the media. Photographs of the president meeting with advisers in the situation room are dispatched. Aides report the president is being briefed regularly on developments. If the president were so adverse to getting out ahead of the facts, he wouldn't have leaned so heavily on the idea that a crude video had sparked the Benghazi attack. Imagine if the White House had reacted to the IRS news the same way it does other crises. The press would've been emailed news that the president woke Treasury Secretary Jack Lew in the middle of the night and said he wanted answers. The president would've called the head of one of the small Tea Party organizations targeted and apologized for the actions of the IRS and promised to get to the bottom of it. Perhaps he would've made promises about the IRS that his authority doesn't even allow him to make. He's done this kind of thing before. During the campaign, when the president was courting women voters, he found time to call Sandra Fluke to offer his support after Rush Limbaugh attacked her for speaking out about medical coverage for contraceptives. All this theatricality doesn't take much time or presidential effort. It would have been a distraction worth enduring to help the president's underlying agenda. It might lower the press feeding frenzy--fewer claims that Obama was asleep on the job, a charge that echoed one of the criticisms about the response to the Benghazi attack. With health care implementation relying on the IRS and immigration reform likely to pass only if enough Republicans can be convinced that government will enforce the laws, some demonstration from the president about how seriously he reacts when the government overreaches would not have hurt. In the end, who knows how much of a distraction the IRS scandal will be to the rest of the president's agenda. The public isn't penalizing him--his approval rating is holding steady. On issues like immigration reform, Republicans have a strong incentive to pass a bill that can overcome whatever new dislike they have for the president. It's also not certain that a perfect response to the first news reports about the IRS would have stopped his opponents from taking advantage of this scandal. No one loves the IRS and there is legitimate fault in this instance. For Republican lawmakers constantly being put to purity tests by conservative elites, the scandal also offered a chance to lock arms with the grassroots Tea Party cause. Still, it seems that White House aides who know how to exploit issues for political gain would have been a little surer footed given that they had a month to prepare. It's not a crime, or a cover-up, just another example of how hard it is to stay focused."	Does the Obama White House Know How to Manage Its Priorities?

Actually, let's make this exercise even more terrible. Pretend you're an underpaid, low-level clerk working in the understaffed IRS backwater of Cincinnati. Every day, a big stack of files lands on your desk. Every day, the stack gets a little bigger than the last. Each file represents a new application for a certain tax status--501(c)(4), a tax-exempt designation meant for ""social welfare"" organizations. Nonprofits with this status aren't required to disclose the identity of their donors and they're allowed to lobby legislative officials. The catch is that they must limit their political campaign activity. According to IRS rules, 501(c)(4) groups can participate in elections, but electioneering must not be their ""primary"" mission. Got all that? Good--now let's get to work. It's your job to decide which 501(c)(4) applications represent legitimate social-welfare organizations, and which ones are from groups trying to hide their campaign activities. What's more, you've got to sort the good from the bad very quickly, as you're being inundated with applications. In 2010, your office received 1,735 applications for 501(c)(4) status. In 2011, the number jumped 30 percent, to 2,265, and in 2012 there was another 50 percent spike, this time to 3,357 applications. So what do you do? You look for a shortcut. Someone at your office notices that a lot of the applications for 501(c)(4) status are from groups that claim to be part of the burgeoning Tea Party movement. Aha! When you're looking for signs of political activity, wouldn't it make sense to search for criteria related to the largest new political movement of our times? So that's what you do: Without consulting senior managers, you and your colleagues set up a spreadsheet called ""Be on the Lookout,"" or BOLO, which spells out specific criteria for flagging potentially politically active groups. The spreadsheet lists keywords like ""Tea Party,"" ""Patriots,"" and ""9/12 Project."" It also flags groups whose primary concerns are government spending, debt, and taxes, that criticize how the country is being run, or that advocate policies that seek to ""make America a better place to live."" We'll get to whether this was right or wrong in a bit. For now, let's note that there's a name for the kind of shortcut that the IRS's Cincinnati office used to pick out applications for greater scrutiny: ""profiling."" By using superficial characteristics--groups' names or mission statements--to determine whether they should be subject to deeper investigation, the IRS was acting like the TSA agent who pulls aside the guy in the turban, or the FBI agents that target mosques when investigating terrorism, or New York City cops who stop and frisk young black males in an effort to prevent crime. All these efforts rely on the same intellectual justification--looking at surface characteristics makes sense because they're a potential signal of deeper activity, whether it's terrorism or crime or electioneering. As a right-wing blogger might say, ""Not all Muslims are terrorists--but most terrorists are Muslims."" If you believe that, doesn't it make sense to focus on Muslims when you're fighting terrorism? Take it away, Michelle Malkin: ""Where else are federal agents supposed to turn for help in uncovering terrorist plots by Islamic fanatics: Buddhist temples? Knights of Columbus meetings? Amish neighborhoods?"" That's exactly what the IRS was doing with Tea Party groups. Not all Tea Party groups applying for 501(c)(4) status were engaged in campaign politics. But out of all the many groups that applied for such status, wouldn't any reasonable person guess that a group called ""Tea Party Patriots"" is more likely to be engaged in campaign activity than, say, a group focused on rescuing abandoned puppies? The deep irony of the IRS scandal is that people on the political right are being subjected to exactly the kind of profiling that they've long advocated in fighting terrorism and crime--and they don't seem to appreciate it. I'm on their side: This case perfectly illustrates why profiling is wrong--why it's inefficient, ineffective, and morally dubious. The IRS scandal should thus be a lesson to anyone who's called for any kind of profiling, whether it's racial, religious, or political. If you believe it was wrong for the government to single out certain groups just because of their names, then you're really arguing that government officials should look for deeper characteristics when deciding whom to investigate. If you don't like what happened at the IRS, then, you're arguing that profiling is bad policy. The inspector general's report on the IRS's targeting of Tea Party groups offers a couple of primary reasons why we should object to profiling. One, it's unfair--and government officials, the report argues, should make an effort to treat everyone fairly. Profiling Tea Party groups violated this basic tenet: Going after certain groups because of their names ""gives the appearance that the IRS is not impartial in conducting its mission,"" the report says. Instead, the inspector general argues that the IRS should have looked deeper--not at superficial characteristics like their names, but at ""the activities of the organizations and whether they fulfill the requirements of the law."" This is the moral case against profiling: You should look at the substance rather than the surface--look at what a person does, not what he looks like. And it's one that conservative pundits find pretty hilarious. Why should we expect the government to apply its resources ""fairly"" if the world isn't fair? ""It is terribly unfair we can't find an international terrorist organization that 'looks like America,' as they used to say in the Clinton administration,"" says Jonah Goldberg. ""But the sad truth is the people responsible all happen to be Middle Easterners."" He adds: ""You have to be a fool to willingly fish where there are no fish just because you want to be fair to everyone."" A cynic could make the same argument about the Tea Party. Of the 298 applications for tax-exempt status that were pulled aside for closer review by the IRS, about a third were related to Tea Party groups. More than 200 were unrelated to the Tea Party, which the IRS says is proof that the agency was not being ""politically biased"" in its selection for further review. But the inspector general disputes that--the report notes that all groups with ""Tea Party"" or related terms in their names were given closer scrutiny. But why shouldn't that be the case? A ""Tea Party"" group is, by definition, interested in politics. If you're fishing for groups that want to influence elections, wouldn't that be a pretty good pool to fish? Wouldn't it have been foolish to look at other groups just to be ""fair""? Actually, no. This gets to the inspector general's second criticism of profiling: It didn't work. The IG found that of the 298 groups that the IRS selected for further review, 91 showed no sign that they were engaged in ""significant political campaign intervention."" Seventeen of those 91 groups were Tea Party organizations, meaning that 19 percent of all false positives were caused by profiling. Thanks to profiling, the IRS was spending a lot of time scrutinizing groups it shouldn't have been looking at. But that's not all. The IG says that as a result of profiling, there was also a high false-negative rate--investigators were quickly approving certain groups even though they were likely to have engaged in political activity, all because they didn't fit the profile. This is the Richard Reid scenario: Sometimes, a white guy tries to blow up a plane. Sometimes, two Caucasians blow up a sporting event. If you're only looking for the brown guys, you're going to miss those cases. Based on a statistical sample of applications it reviewed, the IG says there were a total of 185 cases that should have been flagged for further review but weren't. That's because, instead of looking at those cases, investigators were spending their time looking at groups with ""Tea Party"" in their names. About 2 percent of applications that were ultimately approved fell into this category, the report says. By profiling Tea Party groups, not only was the IRS applying its rules unfairly, it was also spending a lot of time investigating good guys, and it was letting a few bad guys through without extra scrutiny. If you wanted to make a case against profiling, you couldn't pick a better example than what happened here. I suspect that longtime advocates of profiling won't agree with me. They'll argue that racial profiling in crime- or terrorism-prevention is more appropriate than the ""political"" profiling the IRS conducted. That's because, they'll likely say, profiling works in those instances. There are numerous studies that show that's not true--that we simply don't know whether racial profiling is an effective way to combat terrorism. Even if Tea Party partisans don't buy that argument, they now at least know what it feels like to be investigated just because of their characteristics, not their actions. They don't like it, and in this case they should trust their instincts. They're right. Profiling is wrong."	Will the IRS's Tea Party Profiling Convince Conservatives That All Profiling Is Wrong?
20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/05/barack_obama_watergate_scandal_the_white_house_scandals_are_nothing_like.html	"My Dear Protege: I note in your most recent correspondence that you have used the term ""Watergate"" in connection with the recent troubles facing The Administration. You take a view popular among our kind that raising the specter of this famous scandal will convince your prey to turn against The One. I would like to counsel you against walking this path. First, your instincts are sound. There is much to recommend using Watergate in your work. For 40 years we have relied on it faithfully, hinting at it successfully to bedevil both Democrats and Republicans. Watergate is powerful because it lies at the intersection of ignorance and resonance, like many of our most keen weapons. If I may speak mathematically for a moment, for most people Watergate simply equals bad and they've forgotten (if they ever knew) the collection of facts that led mankind to that conclusion. They know the sum, but not the equation that produced it. Lock the number five in the public mind and you can convince them that the addition of any two numbers equals it. You also face the mounting problem of gaining public attention. Our colleagues in the Twitter, cable news, and reality television branches have succeeded in shredding the modern mind. We see proof in the statistics. Measures of morality, right thinking, posture, and empathy have fallen precipitously. Donald Trump, for example, is still popular. There is nothing but glory in this, but it makes it harder for an aspiring scandalmonger to be heard. Naturally, you chose the Watergate analogy to startle their sleeping ears and excite the somnolent masses in a single jolt. The problem is that the label has become shopworn. The constant application to lesser scandals such as Iran Contra, the Clinton-Lewinsky imbroglio, or the Scooter Libby leak case has scrubbed the analogy down to near meaninglessness. It now signifies overcompensation, telegraphing a weakness in your case. It suggests you are conjuring the ghosts of Watergate because you have so little in the present to frighten men, women, and children. We see how this overcompensation fails in other realms: the guilty child who protests his innocence too volubly, the aging Lothario who uses too much hair dye, or the purchaser of the vehicle known as the Hummer. The weakening of the Watergate analogy has led some to madness as they search for ever-harder stuff. Sen. Dick Durbin and Rep. Keith Ellison, for example, compared President George W. Bush and his administration to the Nazis and Hitler. Exaggeration makes your case easy to dismiss with a single fact. So, for example, in Watergate, President Richard Nixon used the IRS as one of his tools for punishing his enemies. In this instance, President Obama learned about the IRS scrutiny of conservative groups through news reports. That is the difference between cooking dinner and watching a cooking show. You may have many salient points to encourage people to believe in your scandal, but when your Watergate analogy can be this easily dismantled into rubble, you will lose your audience for the other points you want to make. Let me anticipate your objections. You will argue that you only take on scandals that have the potential to become like Watergate and that I censure you too quickly. It is true, in time we may learn something about one of your scandals that does warrant the application of this Watergate analogy. Perhaps you will be lucky enough to find a gem that surpasses Watergate. (We're working on seeing if we can get the mayor of Toronto elected president.) But we are not there yet. When you mumble Watergate at the outset, everything that comes after can only seem less spectacular. When a new fact doesn't live up to the grand billing, your prey will turn away, assuming this is just any old spat between the political parties. Like New Year's Eve, picnics, and the White House Correspondents' Dinner, the reality can never match the hype. Even Watergate wasn't really Watergate. Modesty forbids me from reminding you of my role in that case, but it took us months and months to slowly disclose information. Had people been on the lookout for blockbuster revelations at the outset, we would have been in a sweat constantly trying to meet demand. We would never have been able to keep up. Or we'd have had to invent an alien invasion to keep people on the beam. But we turned this pace to our advantage: Our greatest moments came by surprise. The entire country was glued to their televisions and learned about secret tapes and phone bugging in real time. Everyone was discovering the next revelation in one astonishing national moment after another. That added immeasurable fuel to our cause because no one had time to mount a defense. It was a surprise attack! You may be skeptical because my advice relies on the reason and attention-span of the American public. As I have long warned, we are many generations from that time when people employed their wits to reach conclusions based on facts and logic. But true scandals are perhaps one of the last places where reason plays a flickering role. You must convince supporters of The Administration that it is at fault. They wake up each morning braced against you, so you must make inroads through their minds, not their hearts. Some of your less talented colleagues have fallen short of this standard. They are content to simply initiate a ""partisan fury"" or a media ""feeding frenzy."" Don't aspire to this mediocrity. Merely increasing the flow of saliva among partisans is a low prize. Red-eared tirades on Twitter are too small a trinket. We aim to destabilize the entire operation. For that purpose, we must enlist members of both parties. Watergate succeeded in part because three Republican senators went to their president and asked him to resign. There must be bipartisan outrage to achieve peak scandal. So, in conclusion: Patience, my young scandalmonger. If something is like Watergate, you will not have to say it is so. The words will form on their lips by themselves. Most Sincerely, Muck Raker, Executive Vice President Northeast Region"	Advice to a Young Scandalmonger: Don't Mention Watergate

Left-wing groups. The Daily Caller shared pages of memos and anecdotes from Media Matters for America, then shared quotes from Republicans asking why a liberal press-watching organization deserved 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. ""The standards for tax exemption deserve review as a matter of good stewardship on the part of Congress,"" Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley told the website, ""and should be considered as part of any comprehensive tax reform."" At least! ""The collaboration that they talk about on a weekly basis with the White House means this is a political operation,"" shuddered Sean Hannity on his Fox News show, in one of many conservative kibitzes about the Media Matters stories. ""This is not a 501(c)(3)--you know, tax-exempt organization. This sounds like a political organization and close collaboration with the White House."" And this is how politicos used to talk about tax-exempt groups. Until last Friday, actually, it was ordinary to hear them decry or ridicule the 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) exemptions intended for ""social welfare"" but used pretty nakedly for politics. In the George W. Bush era, the NAACP was investigated on those grounds, and some conservatives executed mid-air high-fives. During the 501(c)(4) explosion of 2010, when Americans for Prosperity and American Crossroads started taking Democrats out at the knees, President Obama derided them for ""posing as non-profit, non-political groups."" You can watch Obama say that now, if you're not too busy, because the Washington Free Beacon has compiled the president's 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) zingers into ominous video. Oh, and the Washington Free Beacon is a project of the Center for American Freedom, a 501(c)(4) group whose mission statement is a word-for-word parody of the Center for American Progress, the progressive 501(c)(4) created by exiled Clintonites. Again: This is how it used to work. People agreed that the tax-exempt system was a joke. If everybody told the same joke at once, the damage and the shaming could be spread around. That's not true anymore. The IRS scandal (or its spinners) is quickly creating a new right, a right no politician should take away--the right to start a tax-free organization that can play in politics. For the moment, anyone on the left who challenged this status quo is being retconned into an accomplice of the most hated Cincinnati IRS office in American history. And so, every few hours this week, the National Republican Senatorial Committee has hit out at the Democrats' 2014 incumbents and candidates. In the past, many of these finks had criticized political-acting 501(c)(4)s. ""Why did the IRS target these people?"" asked NRSC spokesman Brad Dayspring in a Thursday jeremiad typical of the genre. ""Because [New Hampshire Sen.] Jeanne Shaheen and [New York Sen.] Chuck Schumer pressured them to. Today, Shaheen and Schumer pretend to be outraged by [their] OWN actions."" Shaheen and Schumer never told the IRS to go after, say, the Kentucky 9/12 Project. They were panicking about groups like Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies. According to its mission statement, it was ""a non-profit public policy advocacy organization that is dedicated to educating, equipping, and engaging American citizens to take action on important economic and legislative issues that will shape our nation's future."" According to observable reality, it and other Crossroads groups spent around $300 million to attack Democratic candidates. Democrats, awkwardly, have attempted to use the new IRS scandal to remind everyone of why they feared the new 501(c)(4)s. ""These so-called social welfare organizations must make their goal social welfare and not politics,"" said Nancy Pelosi on Thursday, at her weekly press conference. She made a pitch for the DISCLOSE Act, which withered in 2010, but would have (in a manner yet untested by courts) required tax-exempt groups engaging in politics to disclose their donors. Republicans have stuck to the new script--and it really is new. The Huffington Post's Michael McAuliff made a good catch at the start of the week, noticing an old interview with Sen. Mitch McConnell full of the old ""the left abuses tax-exempt status"" gospel. ""Most of the so-called charitable organizations who are involved in political activity in this country,"" said the senator, ""who are, in my judgment, involved in arguable violations of their tax-free status and violations of the campaign laws, happen to be groups on the left."" But when McAuliff followed up, McConnell declared that ""people are entitled not only to petition the Congress for redress of grievances under the First Amendment, but to say whatever they choose to in criticism or praise about any of us."" Money is speech. Even secretive money is speech. Demanding disclosure, or audits, was a threat to that speech. All manner of political-looking groups are crying havoc now, citing the new standard. The conservative Thomas More Society has produced evidence that a pro-life group couldn't get tax exemption unless and until it promised not to protest Planned Parenthood clinics. The Leadership Institute has just revealed the details of a 2011 audit; complying with that cost them $50,000. Actually, the Leadership Institute audit gives us a perfect example of the shift on 501 status and the rights of man. Here's how WFB reporter CJ Ciaramella reported it. ""The IRS' indefensible behavior is worse than we first thought, as it targeted both new and existing conservative groups in politically motivated attacks,"" said Morton Blackwell, president of the Leadership Institute, in a statement. ""Fortunately my Leadership Institute had the resources to stand up to the government's bullying and intimidation. Other groups, including grassroots and tea party groups we've helped train, did not."" Blackwell's a member of the Republican National Committee, but that's not the point. Here's how the campaign finance lawyer C. Boyden Gray described the possible offenses of Media Matters, back in February 2012, zeroing in on the group's ""political training"" program. The political training Gray refers to is the Media Matters ""Progressive Talent Initiative,"" a program designed to instruct left-leaning pundits on how to effectively bring the liberal gospel to the airwaves. Gray said trainees could easily bring these newly acquired talents to Democratic campaigns, which he believes could be problematic for the legal status of their training organization. What's the difference between the Leadership Institute training young politicos on the right and Media Matters training young politicos of the left? Nothing. There's no difference. The campaign finance scolds were standing on solid ground, until in one week it shifted about 1,000 miles to the right. You could see the shift on Thursday, when conservative Republicans (led by Rep. Michele Bachmann) gathered outside the Capitol with Tea Party leaders who'd been hassled by the IRS. Speaker after speaker decried the IRS for trampling on free speech--by holding back on tax-exempt ""social welfare"" status for groups that would eventually show up outside the Capitol, next to conservative Republicans. Some Republicans still wrestled with the tax issue. Maybe it would make more sense to scrap the system--ideally, to dynamite the whole IRS--and let people engage in politics without worrying about for-profit status or nonprofit status or being accused of violating one or the other. ""Once they force you into this funnel to have that legal status,"" said Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert, ""then you're hassled and abused."" But a lot of activists want or need to jump into that funnel. For that reason, said Georgia Rep. Paul Brown, ""The IRS needs to be nonpartisan."" Be nonpartisan, sure--but how? ""They need to look at any group that qualifies for 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(4) status and give it to him."""	Why the GOP Loves Tax-Exempt Organizations--Until It Doesn't
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/05/darrell_issa_eric_holder_argue_at_judiciary_hearing_barack_obama_s_strategy.html	"Rep. Darrell Issa was almost finished with his question to Attorney General Eric Holder when he suddenly allowed his witness a Moment. That was dangerous. Reporters like Moments. They write our stories for us, and allow us more free time to spend worrying about the stock price of our media companies or whether the hot new Web app will put us out of work again. They're much less useful for the politicians who make them. And yet we saw it coming with Issa. When he arrived at today's House Judiciary Committee hearing, cameramen jumped up for fresh photos of the Benghazi star. The California Republican flashed a smile for them. Halfway through his questions, as he asked Holder to make more e-mails from labor secretary nominee Tom Perez public, Issa couldn't resist mocking his witness's answers. ""Our investigators have seen 34 of the 35 emails that violate the Federal Records Act,"" said Issa. ""They have only seen the To and From."" Holder apologized, offering one of many surprised-sounding explanations to a question he hadn't really thought about. ""I'm sure there must have been a good reason why only the To and From parts were--"" Issa interrupted him. ""Yes, you didn't want us to see the details."" He briefly broke up with laughter, as did staffers behind him. Holder pounced. ""No, no, that's what you typically do,"" he said, talking over Issa. ""No, I'm not going to stop talking now. You have characterized something as--"" Issa tried to assert his fleeting dominance of the room. ""Mr. Chairman,"" he asked Rep. Bob Goodlatte, ""would you inform the witness as to the rules of this committee?"" Holder kept talking. ""That is inappropriate,"" he said, ""and is too consistent with the way in which you conduct yourself as a member of Congress. It's unacceptable, and it's shameful."" A little noise rose from the press and public watching this display--a little embarrassed ""Ooooooh."" This wasn't just drama, it was drama Issa must have been ready for. President Obama's administration doesn't like or respect the congressman, at all. Two years ago this week, the White House actually hired a communications staffer who'd been battle-hardened by Senate and presidential campaigns, and gave him a hot portfolio: ""matters relating to and resulting from investigations launched by Rep. Darrell Issa."" Since then Obama and company have treated every Issa request like an incoherent bleat from a crazy person. At a two-question press conference this week, the president derided Congress for obsessing over Benghazi. ""Who executes some sort of cover-up or effort to tamp things down for three days?"" he asked. Holder himself, later in 2011, had smacked back at his inquisitor by accusing him of McCarthyism. ""At some point,"" he'd told Issa, ""as they said in the McCarthy hearings--at some point, have you no shame?"" In another time--or maybe because they haven't got around to it yet this time--Republicans would have called these ""Saul Alinksy tactics."" Another, simpler term might just be ""tactics."" Democrats in the Obama era have always exploited the other side, elevating the people and arguments they can most easily deride. That didn't quite work in 2009 and 2010. There was a brief moment when Democrats thought voter anger over the health care bill, boiling over in town hall meetings, would be good for the president, because independents would react with horror at the outbursts. That was an easy mistake. The White House thought that voters would react to angry Tea Party activists the way they reacted to politicians, to members of Congress. They didn't. But voters still hate members of Congress, and there are plenty of them to mock, and to ask people to mock. As the Benghazi story returned last week, the White House found an unwitting ally in Sen. Rand Paul, who kept admitting that the story was potentially damaging to Hillary Clinton. ""I think it precludes Hillary Clinton from ever holding office,"" he kept saying. This was supposed to be a Republican subtext. Paul kept writing it in plain old text. The White House would like to keep running this play, if Republicans would only go along with it. Their strongest possible allies right now are any members of Congress who muse about impeachment, which they'll be asked about as they run the circuit of conservative talk radio and conferences. Over the weekend, Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe, who's early to jump on any administration scandal, told the conservative talker Rusty Humphries that ""people may be starting to use the I-word before too long."" Most Republicans know the game. On Tuesday, as he was talking to reporters about the less-exciting push for a select committee on Benghazi (something Sen. Harry Reid and House Speaker John Boehner keep nixing), Sen. John McCain made a clownishly disgusted face at the very idea. ""Wait a minute!"" he said. "" Let's find out all the facts, before we say the I-word."" But it had already been said, with all the expected side effects. In 1974, the conservative activist and writer M. Stanton Evans joked that scandal made him realize that the president had the right enemies: ""I didn't support Nixon until Watergate."" In 2013, the White House aims to simultaneously prove that the IRS, Benghazi, and AP stories don't implicate the president and that the people who think it does are themselves a grave danger. The Issa-Holder showdown helped that along. The tensest moments over the rest of the day came when Republicans tried to trap Holder in a theoretical violation of procedure. He had outsourced the investigation of media leaks to two U.S. attorneys, but he had never actually written down that he was recusing himself from the investigation. The U.S. attorneys ended up acting as if Holder were recused, going to a deputy AG to subpoena AP reporters' information. ""Are you saying there's no paper trail here?"" asked Pennsylvania Rep. Tom Marino. ""[Nothing to say] why you recused yourself and for what reasons?"" ""As I've thought about it,"" said Holder, ""actually during the course of this hearing, that might be a better policy."" ""Don't you think it would have been the best practice for you to just put it in writing?"" asked Idaho Rep. Raul Labrador. ""I'm gonna go back and think about whether there's some sort of policy I ought to put in place,"" said Holder. The hearing concluded; the White House released a trove of internal emails about Benghazi and announced a presidential press conference for Thursday. All that was needed to keep on polarizing the scandals was one more Republican going off and freelancing about them. And there, right there in the reporter's inbox, was the manna from heaven. Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, chairwoman of the Tea Party Caucus and former federal tax attorney, will hold a press conference on Thursday, May 16, with Tea Party leaders who will tell their stories of IRS intimidation and demand further investigation."	The White House Strategy For Dealing With GOP-Fueled Scandals
23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/05/barack_obama_irs_and_associated_press_scandals_the_president_s_administration.html	"It must get confusing in the IT department at the Associated Press: Are you talking about the hackers who hacked our Twitter account or the Justice Department hackers who hacked our phones? Monday, the Associated Press reported that the Justice Department had secretly obtained two months of records of phone conversations by its reporters. Meanwhile, the Washington Post revealed that the Internal Revenue Service's targeting of conservative groups was more widespread than first reported. Someone at the IRS also leaked information about conservative groups to ProPublica. The Environmental Protection Agency may also have made it easier for environmental groups to file Freedom of Information Act requests than conservative organizations. The Obama administration is doing a far better job making the case for conservatism than Mitt Romney, Mitch McConnell, or John Boehner ever did. Showing is always better than telling, and when the government overreaches in so many ways it gives support to the conservative argument about the inherently rapacious nature of government. First let's get our terms straight. Conservatives are not the same as Republicans. The former believe in a philosophy which stays roughly fixed and the latter belong to a party that occasionally embraces the philosophy but deviates when necessary to win elections, pass legislation, and follow the selfish aims of those who are in office and want to remain there. Conservatives argue against the expansion of government, whereas Republicans sometimes enlarge it to please their constituents or themselves. Republicans also sometimes botch foreign policy operations and spin themselves silly in their aftermath, which is why the Benghazi revelations are left out of this grand unification theory. Though some of these scandals will allow Republicans to score points in the daily tally of who is ahead and who is behind, there is a larger benefit to conservatives that goes beyond the fall in the president's approval ratings or the boost Republican Senate candidates may get in 2014. Those outcomes rely on further adjudication of these issues. It may turn out that President Obama had nothing to do with any of them. It could simply be rogues in various agencies. Or, maybe President Obama orchestrated the whole kaleidoscope of wrongdoing on the White House whiteboard. You don't have to embrace either of those theories to see that it's much easier to agree with the conservative notion that government is a mess. We have enough evidence of that already. Conservatives argue that the more government you have, the more opportunities you will have for it to grow out of control. That is why my frequent correspondent Charles Flemming cheers every story I write about Washington gridlock. He wants less government, so he's fine if it does nothing. Another conservative correspondent points to economist James Buchanan, who won the Nobel Prize in 1986 for his work studying economic incentives in government. His argument was that politicians are not benevolent agents of the common good but humans acting in their own self-interest or for a special interest. ""If there is value to be gained through politics,"" Buchanan wrote, ""persons will invest resources in efforts to capture this value."" Since Democrats and Republicans alike are sinful, each side will find ways to work that is self-interested, rapacious, and boundary breaking. Keep the government small to limit the damage. Whether these scandals are the result of base motives or a desire to act for the greater good, the eventual result is the destruction of individual liberties. Your IRS comes down on you because you have the wrong ideology or, in the name of protecting the citizenry, the Justice Department starts listening to your phone calls. The confluence of these moments of government overreach may not swell the ranks of conservative clubs, but it could have an effect on policy. As Sen. Lamar Alexander has long argued, conservatives believe not only in limited government, but limitations to sweeping acts by government. Large comprehensive bills like the proposed immigration reform and the Obama health care plan lead to too many unintended consequences. Alexander quotes Irving Kristol, who called himself a ""policy skeptic."" His skepticism is rooted in what appears to have happened at the Justice Department, IRS, and EPA: Big sprawling government inevitably gets out of hand. Seventy-three percent of the public already says they distrust the government, according to a Pew Research Center poll. A general distrust of government most immediately threatens comprehensive immigration reform. House Republicans prefer a step-by-step approach, which is gaining support. Supporters of a comprehensive approach must convince skeptics that the government will enforce the strict limits on illegal immigration that are part of the deal. This government? Obamacare is already the law of the land, but as Republicans try to dismantle it they will be assisted by front-page stories about government incompetence and overreach as the program starts getting implemented this fall. This moment may allow some insight into the views of those who opposed gun control legislation. During the debate over background checks, three Republicans senators who ultimately voted against the Manchin-Toomney compromise talked about ""paranoia"" among some gun owners about a national gun registry. The government would never go that far, these GOP senators believed, but their constituents did. Liberals pointed out that the Manchin-Toomey legislation had provisions that would have increased penalties for any kind of gun registry. They argue that rules were in place to discourage excessive behavior. Conservatives saw it a different way: The excessive behavior is inherent, so no rules will discourage it. Not every conservative saw nightmares of a national gun registry, but if you are already skeptical of government solutions and Manchin-Toomey would have done nothing to prevent the massacre that gave birth to it--as its authors admitted--your inherent distrust of government would make you unlikely to support it. A law that is out of sync with the problem that gave rise to its creation will undoubtedly get out of joint in its implementation. If these scandals are indeed affecting the ideological landscape, this is bad news for liberals. It's not just that the opposite ideology is getting some help from government bunglers, but the media is exacerbating the problem. Liberals believe that there is a role for government to play in mediating market failures, and there are plenty of stories of areas where the safety net is thinning as a result of sequestration--from cancer treatments to Head Start to Meals-on-Wheels--where government should step in. But those stories get lost in the scandal coverage of an administration, making it look like conservatives fundamentally understand something that liberals do not."	Obama Is Making the Case for Conservatism Better Than Mitt Romney Ever Did
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/05/irs_targets_the_tea_party_and_benghazi_why_barack_obama_s_best_chance_at.html	In the past couple weeks, in interviews with House and Senate staffers for the Republican leadership, there has been a depressing message: Nothing is going to get done for the next four years. Again and again, the same mantra could be heard. Partisanship and election jockeying for 2014 and 2016 is going to keep everything locked up. Watching the live feed from the White House on Friday it became hard to argue otherwise. President Obama held an event with mothers defending the Affordable Care Act, the start of a monthslong effort to protect his signature achievement, which Republicans have promised to fight all the way to the 2014 elections and beyond. Then, shortly thereafter, White House press secretary Jay Carney jumped between answering questions about the administration's response to the attacks in Benghazi to the Internal Revenue Service targeting the Tea Party and other conservative political groups for audits. It's going to take some time to get to the bottom of these controversies, but we can conclude the pessimists are probably right. Nothing is going to get done in this siege environment. That has long been the state of play in Washington for many observers. Still, there were a few politicians cupping their hands around the flame of bipartisanship. The president was one. He took two Republican senators golfing this week, the latest in a string of efforts to fashion some kind of a budget deal. GOP senators on the receiving end of that charm were also working with the White House to reach a deal. This week, I talked to Sen. Lamar Alexander, one of the senators the president invited to dinner last month. He testified to the president's good faith on the budget. He thought President Obama was making an honest effort to achieve a grand bargain. He not only said that the president was sincere but that his chief of staff Denis McDonough was working with Republicans like no Obama envoy before him. The substantive differences between the president and Republicans on the budget may be insurmountable, but now it seems like even if the pipe dream of a substantive budget agreement could be reached it wouldn't be enough. Even if Republican senators can engage in a trust-building exercise with the White House, how can they convince their constituents that the president is offering them a fair deal on the budget? A poisoned well is now roiling. Any Republican who tries to convince their constituents about a deal will now likely get funny looks. Their constituents would wonder why they were engaged in negotiations with an administration that has told evolving stories about its response to the attack in Benghazi and that houses an IRS targeting conservative groups. These twin controversies will spur more congressional hearings. That, in turn, means months more of disclosures, rabbit holes, and partisan attacks. For many liberals, this is the obvious point of the politically motivated Benghazi inquiries: to pin the president down and leave him ineffective. Perhaps it was always likely that something would blow the long-shot budget negotiations off course, but the continued effort by the president and a handful of Republican senators suggested at least a glimmer of opportunity. The light appears to have gone out.	Why Our Last Best Chance at Bipartisanship Just Died
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/05/benghazi_hearing_darrell_issa_s_house_committee_s_investigation_of_the_death.html	"Rep. Jason Chaffetz finally choked up. When his turn came at today's House Oversight hearings on ""Benghazi""--the catchall name for the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on the consulate in that Libyan city, and its aftermath--the Utah congressman got to prod Gregory Hicks, former deputy chief of mission in Libya, on the timeline. Hicks had already told Republican investigators about the seven-person rescue team, including four U.S. Special Forces, that was delayed in heading from Tripoli (where Hicks was) to the consulate, after it was under attack. ""How did the personnel react,"" asked Chaffetz, ""at being told to stand down?"" Hicks remembered them being furious. ""I will quote Lt. Col. Gibson,"" said Hicks, referring to the commander at the Special Operations Command Africa who'd expected to join the mission. ""He said, 'This is the first time in my career that a diplomat has more balls than someone in the military.' "" Chaffetz bit his lip. ""So the military is told to stand down, not engage in the fight,"" he said. ""These are the kind of people""--he sharply drew back his breath--""willing to engage."" This wasn't the first time cojones had been singled out in the controversy and roundabout investigation of Benghazi. Charles Woods, whose son (and former Navy SEAL) Tyrone died rescuing Americans from the consulate, met Vice President Biden at the memorial service. The elder Woods, horrified, revealed what Biden told him: ""Did your son always have balls the size of cue balls?"" Undeniably crude and unmistakenly Biden, it cut to the most horrifying question about Benghazi: Some people had wanted to rush in when the consulate, and a small rescue team, was under attack. They didn't get there. Why? Call it the ""stand down"" question. It started in October 2012, when Fox News' Jennifer Griffin reported that Tyrone Woods et al., stationed a mile from the consulate, ""informed their higher-ups ... to tell them what they were hearing and requested permission to go to the consulate and help out,"" but were told to ""stand down"" (Griffin's quotes) twice. At the time, the CIA denied the story--""no one at any level in the CIA told anybody not to help those in need."" More interesting than that was the explanation--not denial--from outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. ""We quickly responded, as [Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff] General Dempsey said, in terms of deploying forces to the region,"" said Panetta. ""We had FAST platoons in the region. We had ships that we had deployed off of Libya. And we were prepared to respond to any contingency and certainly had forces in place to do that. But the basic principle here... is that you don't deploy forces into harm's way without knowing what's going on; without having some real-time information about what's taking place. And as a result of not having that kind of information, the commander who was on the ground in that area, [Africa Command] General [Carter F.] Ham, General Dempsey, and I felt very strongly that we could not put forces at risk in that situation."" That grim assessment has been buried under new Benghazi files and blown whistles. And if you break the Benghazi story into a few components, you can understand why. The outrage over the government's post-attack talking points might be used to implicate Obama administration bureaucrats or political appointees in a pointless cover-up--and it doesn't hurt that one of those appointees is named Hillary Clinton. There's disbelief at the low amount of security in Benghazi and Libya before the attack, and at requests for more aid and security--some from Ambassador Chris Stevens, before he was killed. But that doesn't change the reality of Sept. 11 and Sept. 12, 2012. The Americans in Libya had to work with the tools on hand. That's what makes the ""stand down"" question so ugly, even as it's been altered. That October story about the CIA telling Tyrone Woods and Glenn Doherty to ""stand down"" and let terrorists attack the Benghazi compound has petered out, and didn't appear in today's hearing. The new ""stand down"" story, as told by Charles Woods, concerns that delay of a seven-man team that ended up arriving a little later, able to evacuate Americans but unable to join the younger Woods and Doherty at the front. In his early interviews, and in his testimony, Hicks resisted several Republican attempts to get him to agree that a ""stand down"" order occurred. He never used those two words together. The closest he got today came when Ohio Rep. Mike Turner asked him whether he was telling the truth and DOD was lying. ""Turner: Just as early as last Monday, Maj. Robert Firman, a Pentagon spokesman, said the account hasn't changed. ""There was never any kind of stand-down order to anybody."" Now that's a pretty broad statement, ""anybody."" What's your reaction to the quote by Mr. Firman? I can only again repeat that Lt. Col. Gibson said he was not to proceed to board the airplane. Turner: So your first-hand experience being on the site, standing next to Colonel Gibson, who was on his way on that C-130 transport and being told not to go, contradicts what Mr. Firman is saying on behalf of the Pentagon? Hicks: Yes sir."" But the ""stand down"" quote is the only bit of this contradicted by the Pentagon. Panetta made his comments in October 2012, when Benghazi was still roiling the election. On May 1, 2013, the Pentagon sent a timeline of its actions to the House Armed Services Committee. And according to that, Panetta had OK'd the movement of FAST platoons and a special operations force before 3 a.m. local time, but no aid arrived before the mortar attack that killed Woods and Doherty. According to Hicks, the team wanted to get to Benghazi as quickly as possible. According to Panetta, if it had, it wouldn't have helped. That's why the ""stand down"" question burns. The people who ask it imagine what might have been had a seven-member team rushed to Benghazi and, maybe, some airpower had flown over the city. Panetta and his successors claim, without being too explicit, that none of this would have helped. The die was cast long before the attack, by the weak security at the consulate, and commanders may have decided to cut their losses rather than risking more casualties. And that isn't a story anyone prefers to tell. Correction, May 9, 2013: This article originally misspelled Fox News reporter Jennifer Griffin's last name."	Why the Benghazi Hearings Didn't Tell Us Anything New
26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/05/mark_sanford_wins_the_former_south_carolina_governor_defeated_elizabeth.html	Mark Sanford's long walk has ended. From the South Carolina governor's office to the Appalachian Trail to Argentina and back, he has returned to win a seat in the House of Representatives. Political victory has redemptive powers and so Sanford now has a chance to write a new chapter in his personal history. Whatever may become of him in Washington, he has already changed the shape of Republican politics in South Carolina. The state that is home to Bob Jones University and where residents still resist removing the Confederate flag from over the state house is now defining the new standard for forgiving personal indiscretions. Sanford's history is well known. He left his wife for his Argentine girlfriend while he was governor. South Carolina voters were never in a position to forget his scandalous past. Elizabeth Colbert Busch, Sanford's opponent, raised it in their sole debate and Sanford's fiancee showed up at his victory party when he won the GOP primary.* Sanford's ex-wife wasn't offstage during the campaign either, confirming for reporters that her son had been shocked to meet his father's soul mate for the first time on primary night. This was not an issue voters could ignore. But Sanford's gritty campaigning and over-the-top charm helped him recover. He is well known as a committed fiscal hawk. Conservatives think that type of worldview is needed in Washington. Sanford also enjoyed the help of another woman: Nancy Pelosi. Republican voters in the same district that gave Mitt Romney an 18 percentage point victory over President Obama do not like the House Minority Leader. They couldn't stomach sending her an ally in Colbert Busch. This wasn't the first time the Republican voters of South Carolina put fidelity to party over fidelity to fidelity. In the 2012 Republican primary, voters were reminded of Newt Gingrich's admitted adultery and three marriages. His second wife spoke out just days before the vote. Gingrich won by 12.5 percentage points over the morally pure Mitt Romney. He won 45 percent of the evangelical vote, a group that has at times shown more than a passing interest in the morality of public officials. He won 46 percent of those who said that the religious beliefs of a candidate were very or somewhat important. South Carolina conservatives may still say a candidate's sins matter, but they aren't voting that way. In fact, if you weren't privy to the state's strong social conservative history, you could almost mistake South Carolinians for city folk--people who vote for experience, policy, and political leanings and show a sophisticate's relativism toward personal moral failings. These days, South Carolinians seem almost Parisian when they enter the voting booth. The Palmetto state has come a long way since the GOP primary of 2000. The party--particularly in South Carolina--was once defined by a group of social conservatives who were inflexible about sticking to the principles they believed came from the highest authority. In that contest, Texas Gov. George Bush campaigned at Bob Jones University the day after losing the New Hampshire primary to Sen. John McCain. The fundamentalist institution, which still banned interracial dating at the time, was the perfect symbol for Bush's paean to family values and unbending social conservatism. Sanford and Gingrich won in South Carolina for political and ideological reasons that trumped family values. A candidate without their experience and name identification could not win with their personal baggage. But the Republican Party is undergoing a discussion about the role of principle in public life. Which principles are worth putting aside for political gain? On issues from immigration to protecting the Second Amendment, politicians like Sen. Ted Cruz are on the rise for defending principle in the face of the desires of the crowd. In South Carolina that's still very much the way conservatives see things. Mais pour le moment, quelques principes sont plus importants que d'autres. Correction, May 7, 2013: This article originally misspelled Elizabeth Colbert Busch's surname. (Return.)	Why South Carolina Now Resembles Paris, France
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/05/mark_sanford_and_elizabeth_colbert_busch_in_a_close_race_can_the_disgraced.html	"MT. PLEASANT, S.C.-When people recognize Mark Sanford--this happens extraordinarily often in South Carolina--he notices. He notices the contractor waiting in his car, or the woman shopping for lettuce, or the student who looks up from his phone with an oh-it's-that-guy expression. At a tire store in this Charleston suburb, part of the 1st Congressional District that Sanford wants to represent, he makes the circuit of a waiting room, issuing his icebreaker again and again.= ""Can I be rude,"" he asks, ""and say hello?"" When a voter lifts a camera phone to take a photo, Sanford knows, and he spins around to take charge. ""If you're going to take a picture,"" he says, ""can I be in it?"" If this person is merely a gawker, visiting from Florida or Illinois, Sanford smiles and hands over his business card--""if you have any family in the district, they can call me."" If he might know one of Sanford's sons, the candidate whips out his white iPhone and calls his son for an impromptu chat. If the person makes a joke, Sanford bends his knees and guffaws at the funniest thing he's ever heard. This was how Sanford spent the final weekend of his campaign for Congress, a meet-cute scene repeated ad infinitum across the district. He's done this for nearly five months, and it's gotten easier--instant public affirmation and forgiveness for his trespasses in real time. To win back the congressional seat he held in the 1990s, to be a distinguished gentleman who can once again decry the federal debt and the welfare state, he must single-handedly win over the people who--let's be honest--don't want to elect a Democrat unless they're desperate. So he keeps talking. ""It's a blessing,"" said Sanford on Saturday, as he walked his home turf in Beaufort, S.C. ""I've been to a place in life wherein people didn't want to get pictures of me. It was a very quiet spot. I spent a year on our family farm in northern Beaufort county, which is half an hour up the road--a quite incredibly introspective year."" Beaufort had been taken over in celebration of Candice Glover, an American Idol contestant who'd made it to the final three, thus earning a taped-for-TV parade and concert. Sanford adapted immediately, posing next to a pro-Candice T-Shirt (""The Low Country's Idol"") and greeting people with a chipper ""Happy Candice Day!"" Sanford never appreciated the grip-and-grab-and-grip-some-more side of politics until he'd walked away from it all on the ""Appalachian Trail."" ""If you've been in politics,"" he said, ""you have people who want to take their picture with you, but it was very different. I love people, I've always loved people, but it was the kind of thing you had to do."" But now: ""I was at a thing with my boys. We were trying to get into a football game. It was one of those things where it was incredibly elongated by people who wanted to take pictures."" Sanford grins at the memory of his bored, irritated kids. ""I said guys, you don't get it. This is an incredible blessing."" Many voters here--most of them, possibly--are in the mood to bless him. Mitt Romney won this district by 18 points, but that might even undersell how Republican it is because African-Americans who voted for Barack Obama are harder to turn out in any special election. Elizabeth Colbert Busch, inevitably referred to in national news as ""the sister of TV comedian Stephen Colbert,"" is a business development guru who'd once donated to Sanford. If you're ashamed of Sanford, she's your tolerable alternative. Her radio ad played incessantly on conservative talk radio chides Sanford for voting against dredging the port of Charleston because... well, you know. Mark Sanford had a better use for our tax dollars. He used taxpayer money to be with his mistress in Argentina. Colbert Busch said this to Sanford's face, almost--in their sole debate she reminded everyone that his Argentina trip was ""personal."" Nobody else will get in his face about it, not even after his ex-wife Jenny filed a trespassing complaint against him, not even after voters learned Sanford would have to be in court two days after the election. When an NBC producer asked him about this, Sanford walked from female voter to female voter to ""try to find a woman who doesn't like me."" When I caught up to him in Beaufort, he was still bristling. ""The NBC gal who was with us earlier,"" he said, ""she--"" Sanford was cut short, because a real-life female voter was interrupting him, asking for a photo. For three minutes I waited as Sanford posed and small-talked and posed some more. Eleven different groups of people, mostly women, took home Sanford snapshots. The only dissonance came from a woman who quickly ruined the picture by making ""bunny ears"" over Sanford's head and sprinting away. ""The NBC affiliate comes down from Washington,"" said Sanford, finally, ""and their angle is, you know--you've got a woman problem. I say--What? Come with me. Come with me for the day."" He laughed as he walked over to meet some soldiers walking around Beaufort in fatigues. ""The national media decide what their story is."" The real story, as designed by the Sanford campaign, is this: Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is trying to buy the seat. Colbert Busch's affable promise to work with both sides is a cover story. The message is scrawled on wooden planks that dot the roads from Charleston to Beaufort, in black spray paint--""Sanford Saves Tax $"" and ""Sanford: Boeing = Jobs"" and ""Say No to Pelosi's $1 Million."" At Molly Darcy's, a Charleston bar where Sanford volunteers congregate after work, the first sign is leaned against a fence, partially obscured, making it read simply, religiously, ""Sanford Saves."" The handwriting is as about as crisp as the ones held by cows on those Chick-fil-A ""Eat Mor Chikin"" ads. They're supposed to recast the Sanford campaign as a grass-roots crusade, and they work. ""We gotta stop Pelosi,"" said Wayne Baker, a retired propane salesman, when he got his chance to meet Sanford in Beaufort. ""Hey, I've been through a divorce. Sometimes it works, sometimes it don't. If it don't, you move on, you make yourself a better person. He did his thing. He didn't hide it--he came out in public. The way he did that, I think people got more trust in him."" Baker looks at my notebook and tape recorder. ""You're in the media, so I'm gonna say some things. Do you know why some of the best people don't run? They got a background. They got stones in the backyard you can dig up. But he's already come out with his girlfriend. You can respect that."" Sanford ended his Beaufort trip on the third floor of an office building, on a pleasant porch overlooking the Candice Glover parade. A Republican donor, who keeps intermittently forgetting that I'm a reporter and thanking me for ""everything you're doing for the governor,"" whips out an iPhone and shows me the sort of thing that's ""winning this thing in social media."" It's just a picture of Nancy Pelosi in Joker makeup. Sanford hangs onto every fiber connecting Colbert Busch to national Democrats, from her union support to the donations coming in through the progressive online donation bundling site, ActBlue. ""Somebody told me that Elizabeth Warren, in her race, received half of her funding from ActBlue,"" Sanford informs reporters on Monday. ""I don't know if that's true or not, I just heard it."" The point: ""Be wherever you are. Don't be stealthy."" In other states and campaigns, Democrats like Colbert Busch have threaded the needle. They're not like those other Democrats, the liberals, the ones you can't trust. Colbert Busch attempts to do this by inserting some reference to business experience in whichever part of the sentence it may be grammatical. Sanford's omnipresent radio ad hits the Democrat for theoretically favoring ""Obamacare, economic stimulus, raising the debt ceiling."" That's the kind of district this is--a place where being willing to raise the debt ceiling is a threat to decent people. On Monday, after she finishes a friendly visit to a black barbershop in the north Charleston suburbs, I ask Colbert Busch under what circumstances she'd raise the thing. ""I'm a businesswoman, OK?"" she says. ""Twenty-five years. Before you do anything, before you make any changes, you go in--it's very basic, here's my operations cost, here's how much revenue I can bring in. If my costs are too high, I have too much waste, I'm doing duplicative work, I need to address this first. Until that gets addressed you can't deal with anything else."" Does that mean no debt ceiling hike without spending cuts? Colbert Busch holds up her hands, as if she's weighing bushels on a scale. ""You have to get your cost under control, right? You have to get your fiscal house in order. At the same time you're cutting your waste, you're watching your spending, you prioritize your dollars over""--left hand--""here. What happens when you're prioritizing your investment? You bring this""--right hand--""under control."" Sanford's answer is simpler: He doesn't want to raise it. On Monday, he stumps in more random, friendly locations with Republicans who've endorsed him. At a diner, former Gov. James Edwards warns that a loss here might lead to the loss of the Republican House, which would let President Obama become ""a dictator."" State Rep. Chip Limehouse, one of the Republicans who lost the primary to Sanford, nods along. ""It's a battle for the soul of the country,"" he says. ""If we lose the House, we'll lose America."" ""Then it's all over,"" says Edwards. Nearby, Sanford stands in front of TV cameras and talks about the polling that shows him, finally, inching ahead of Colbert Busch. People made fun of him when he ""debated"" a cardboard cut-out of Nancy Pelosi. But had it worked? ""You know,"" says Sanford, grinning, ""a lot of my friends in the local media circles said I actually won that debate."""	Will Enough South Carolinians Buy Mark Sanford's Nice-Guy Routine?
28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/05/arizona_anti_immigration_movement_while_comprehensive_immigration_reform.html	"PHOENIX--Russell Pearce notices me noticing the license plate on his truck: ARZ1070. It's three years to the day since the former state senator presided over the passage of the Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act--SB 1070--the law that required noncitizens to carry their registration at all times and empowered police to check the citizenship status of anyone they made ""lawful contact"" with. ""You'd think it's a specialty plate,"" says Pearce, as we walk into the suburban Denny's where he likes to meet with Republican legislators. ""I used to be the director of motor vehicles. We passed the bill, and I called up and said, 'I'll pay for a plate that says SB 1070 if I need to, but do you have one ready to go?' They call me back, and they say: 'You won't believe this, but ARZ1070 is on top of the pile about to go out. I can pull it for you.' I say, 'Please!' "" Looking back, the passage of SB 1070 was the peak of Pearce's career. Everything else, like the successful 2004 voter ID ballot initiative, led up to SB 1070; everything since has been a letdown. In November 2011, Pearce became the first Arizona senator to lose a recall election. In 2012, he tried and failed to win a new seat. He still works with Republicans--he'll strategize with them later at a meeting of the state ""liberty caucus""--but he ""probably won't run again."" Immigration reformers won't miss him. In Arizona, they describe Pearce's loss as the moment ""the fever"" broke. ""He was one that every reporter would go to,"" says U.S. Sen. Jeff Flake. ""And they usually didn't have to, because he'd usually be in front of a microphone somewhere. There were a lot of people who listened to him on this. Not having him at the tip of newscasts, criticizing, or organizing events and press conferences--it just makes for a different environment."" A year after the recall, when he was making his first run for the U.S. Senate, Flake nearly lost. Republicans lost supermajorities in the Arizona legislature (they still run both houses), and Democrats won five of the state's nine redistricted U.S. House seats. ""Almost everyone believed that Romney was not only going to win, but win big, up until the day of the election,"" says Clint Bolick, the libertarian attorney who now directs litigation at the Goldwater Institute in Phoenix and who co-authored Jeb Bush's new book about immigration reform. ""My wife and other Tea Party types, they were telling me: 'You've got to stop reading the New York Times. They're going to be wrong.' Losing forced people into some serious soul-searching. I know some Tea Party folks are rethinking the issue now, and that conversation simply never happened before."" Pearce knows all about that. ""In 2007, the last time they had a bill in Congress, you had a backstop,"" he says, working his way through his Grand Slam breakfast. ""I think there'll be a mass exodus from the Republican Party. It may be the impetus that creates a third party. And I may lead that drive to create an American Independent Party."" Who would join him? Many of the activists who made their names in the roughest stretch of the immigration wars, from the failure of the 2006 reform bill in Congress to the passage of SB 1070, have disappeared from the scene. Michelle Dallacroce, whose work with Mothers Against Illegal Aliens made her a cable news regular for years, basically packed it up in 2008. Chris Simcox, who led the Minuteman Project to prominence from a newspaper office in Tombstone, Ariz., grew absorbed in a brutal legal battle against his wife at the same time three Minutemen went on trial for a robbery that devolved into a triple murder. The media's paying less attention now, and the hosts who could be counted on to shower the anti-immigration crowd with coverage have either lost their perches (Lou Dobbs) or moved on (Bill O'Reilly). Talk radio made celebrities out of the restrictionists in the 1990s and 2000s; the Minuteman Project's Jim Gilchrist famously first heard his calling when he caught Simcox being interviewed by a right-wing California talker. But driving around the Phoenix suburbs, the conservative talk radio that comes in clearest is Salem Radio's lineup--hosts like Michael Medved and Hugh Hewitt, who want Republicans to sign on to reform and win some elections. ""We have the same people and activists with us this time, to some extent,"" says Sean McCaffrey, who was executive director of the Arizona GOP during the 2007 immigration fight and now helps run Pearce's Ban Amnesty Now. ""In 2007, we didn't just jam the phone lines in Congress. On two occasions, activists basically shut down their email accounts."" Why does the movement seem weaker now? ""I mean, think of it like a Rocky movie,"" says McCaffrey. ""You see Rocky, and you're just as excited about Rocky II. You see Rocky III, and you're still excited. You see Rocky IV, and, well, it's patriotic, but it's a letdown. Rocky V comes around, and you think, 'Do I care about this anymore?' We'd won so many times, in 2004 and 2006 and 2007 and 2010, that maybe fatigue set in. And we didn't expect the Marco Rubios to turn on us."" Reality turned on them, too. Illegal border crossings have slowed since the great backlash of the Bush era. Restrictionists credit the sagging American economy and the successes of their own laws. ""Some illegals have left because the economy's so bad,"" says state Rep. John Kavanagh, who co-sponsored SB 1070 in the House. ""When the jobs come back in a few years, do they really think we'll have the same level of crossing? No, we'll have a whole new wave."" Kavanagh was a Port Authority cop in New York City before he took his pension and moved to Arizona in the 1990s. He keeps umbrellas in his office as decorations--there's no reason to use them in the hot, comfortable sprawl of Maricopa County. If life's more pleasant here, there's no kindling for a backlash. ""The wind left the sails of the anti-immigration movement when many of the additional measures we were promoting were put on hold by courts and when we won on SB 1070,"" says Kavanagh. ""That was when the momentum slowed; we discovered that federal courts would prevent us from doing more. The recall of Russell Pearce was a tragedy, and it hurt morale, but that was it."" It did something else: It revealed a new sophistication among pro-legalization activists and a new coalition for reform. In 2007, coverage of legalization rallies focused on protesters who waved Mexican flags and spoke Spanish. It fed right into the fear that the movement's goal was a lawless reconquista of the Southwest. I meet up with Ron Ludders and Bob Thomas, conservative strategists who've worked for Pearce before, and they insist that the legalization supporters' tone enabled the defeat of the last immigration bill and the passage of SB 1070. ""It said that these people weren't like the Hispanics we knew before,"" says Thomas. ""We lived side by side with each other. We lived north of I-10. Little Mexico was south of I-10. There were good people there. They were quiet, they were good, they were respected. But in 2007, there was a movement here in Arizona where Latinos marched in the streets."" ""They put the American flag on the ground and started dancing on it,"" says Ludders. ""Urinating on the flag,"" says Thomas. ""The media was watching all of this; it was basically their coming-out party."" The restrictionists agree: Pro-legalization groups are more sophisticated now. They've got allies in the churches who share a problem with Republicans: They need more recruits. Some Mormon donors eventually turned on Pearce (who's Mormon himself) and used the 2011 recall to remove an impediment to their Hispanic outreach. Back at Denny's, Pearce finishes defending his record and the success of SB 1070--crime's down 15 percent in the county!--and walks me outside. He grabs his keys with a hand missing half of one finger; it was shot off when he was still a cop and he blocked a bullet that could have killed him. Before he climbs into the ARZ1070 truck, he wonders one more time where all the restrictionists have gone. ""We had huge rallies down at the capitol,"" says Pearce. ""The media was down here in hordes. We don't have that now, and I don't understand it. Maybe the media's convinced us that we need to do something on immigration. But it isn't true."""	Why Arizona's Anti-Immigration Movement Called It Quits
29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/05/obama_press_conference_he_needs_to_worker_harder_than_the_republicans.html	"President Obama was asked at his Monday news conference whether he has the ""juice"" to get his agenda through Congress. But presidential juice is like the juice at fancy hotels: It comes in a tiny little glass. The framers were very anti-juice. They designed a system that makes it very hard for the president to accumulate a lot of it. President Obama tried to explain this to the press, pointing out that he's not the only actor in the Washington drama. He's got to deal with a reluctant Congress and an oppositional Republican party. It was a reasoned explanation for gridlock and could very well stir people to agreement , at least for the five minutes they were paying attention. The problem wasn't the president's logic. The problem was his tone, which suggested he was defeated, licked, and out of gas. He may still be carrying on the battle, but he'd lost the fight. A lot of the recent criticism of the president falls into the action-hero view of the presidency that I wrote about last fall. There is a persistent notion that a president can overcome obstacles through force of will. This president suffers particularly from the superhero delusion because during the 2008 campaign he summoned vast crowds and promised achievements that could only be accomplished through special powers. Even the most rhetorically successful president still has to deal with the engine of Congress, which is broken in any number of ways. Some of it is structural: Lawmakers are more partisan than ever and in the Senate the filibuster makes 60 the threshold for any action. A president applying his juice has fewer people to convince and must convince more of them. Despite these structural obstacles, presidents are expected to do more. That's why every president has complained about the outsized expectations of the office. LBJ--the muscular model to whom Obama is sometimes unfavorably compared --told Richard Nixon that being president was like being a jackass in a hail storm. Sometimes you just have to stand there and take it. Harry Truman said about the presidency: ""I sit here all day long trying to persuade people to do things they ought to have sense enough to do without my persuading them ... That's all the power of the president amount to."" President Obama echoed this frustration at his news conference: ""You seem to suggest that somehow these folks over there have no responsibilities, and that my job is to somehow get them to behave,"" he said of Congress. ""That's their job. They're elected-- members of Congress are elected in order to do what's right for their constituencies and for the American people."" But if every president faces the same outsized expectations, what distinguishes the great ones is that they keep trying and even if that doesn't work, they keep making it look like they're trying. Bold persistent experimentation, is what FDR called it. ""Take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another. But by all means, try something,"" said Roosevelt. Try something. It will either work or people will wonder why your adversaries aren't trying as hard as you are. Obama doesn't seem to have actually given up. He's reaching out to Republican senators and those he's worked with attest to his sincerity in getting deals on immigration and the budget. But that was hard to tell from the news conference. Let's assume, for the purpose of this narrow argument, the president is right about the structural hurdles he faces. Let's assume Republicans are totally at fault. So, the president has chosen to walk down the hall from the Oval Office to explain this to reporters who he knows will ask about his agenda. What is the best way for him to achieve his policy goals? The president chose sweet reason. On a host of issues, he patiently explained the situation and why the choices Congress is making are not rational. It was cogent but likely to move no one. If you're going to bestir yourself from the Oval Office, shouldn't you throw your back into it? Instead of telling people about the gridlock, why not show them how hard you're working despite the long odds. The image of the half-crazed president sweating in the boiler room might stir people to think: hey, why aren't the vacationing Republicans in Congress trying just as hard? This is why Bill Clinton talked about working ""till the last dog dies."" He may not have had superpowers, but he was going to behave like he did. Working harder--and seeming to work harder--is not a fantastical strategy. It simply tries to imagine how Obama might use his existing tools to achieve the limited goals of his afternoon news conference. The president has these tools. He certainly knows how to tell a story to convey how high the stakes are. He could talk about cancer patients not getting their chemotherapy or William McCormick, who lives in poverty and depends on Meals on Wheels but gave up his food anyway because he knew others were probably suffering more under sequestration cuts. The president knows that by telling these stories and witnessing to these injustices, he becomes a champion of a cause, not an analyst of it. Would this work? We know the powers of the bully pulpit are overstated, so probably not, but in a world of limited options it's one that would seem to serve his interests.  But there is a trope in superhero movies where the good guy unloads his gun at the bad guys, then in a last ditch attempt to do something (anything!), he throws the empty gun at them. This is a desperate act that is unlikely to work, but it does convey the passion of the character who doesn't have many options left. Throw the gun!"	Obama Needs to Show the American People He's Working Harder Than the Republicans
