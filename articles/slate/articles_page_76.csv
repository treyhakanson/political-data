Six days to go: Today's Good News for Obama: With the election so close, everyone is desperately attempting to divine who has the edge. In the waning days of the election, an unlikely indicator has emerged: Halloween retailers. Spirit Halloween is the largest seasonal Halloween retailer in the country and its sales have correctly predicted the winning presidential candidate since 1996. According to CNN Money, Obama masks are outselling Romney masks 60 percent to 40 percent--good news for the incumbent. Buycostumes.com also has what it calls ""The Official Presidential Mask Poll 2012,"" with a tally of which candidate is winning in each state. Mask sales have accurately predicted the election winner in the last three races. Again, it offers good news for Obama, whose likeness will be knocking on doors across the country tonight. (Happy Halloween!) See Barack Obama's earlier rays of hope. See Mitt Romney's earlier rays of hope."	Why Today Was a Good Day for Barack Obama

On Oct. 27, nanoseconds after the Des Moines Register endorsed Mitt Romney, the Republican campaign hot-lined an ""In Case You Missed It"" email to reporters. As if any of them had missed it. The political press was already in full sweaty-palm tweet-mode about the Iowa paper's first GOP endorsement since Nixon '72. Stephanie Cutter, the Obama campaign's master of the can-you-believe-this-crap snicker, had to sit and listen to George Stephanopoulos read the endorsement to her before she could say it wasn't ""based in reality.""* She was wrong. It was based in a brighter, more optimistic version of reality. ""Romney had to tack to the right during the primary season,"" argued the paper's editors. ""Since then, he has recalibrated his campaign to focus on his concern for the middle class, and that is believable if the real Mitt Romney is the one on display as governor of Massachusetts who passed a health care reform plan that became the model for the one passed by Congress."" The Romney campaign's email excerpted most of the editorial. It skipped the ""ifs."" At least 21 newspapers that endorsed Barack Obama in 2008 have endorsed Mitt Romney in 2012. Half of these endorsements are couched in the hope that Romney hornswoggled Republican primary voters and will govern as a moderate. ""Like his primary rivals,"" editorialized Florida Today, ""we never bought Romney's newfound conservative purity. During the presidential debates, Romney wisely resumed his identity as a pro-growth pragmatist."" And ""pro-growth,"" in the Space Coast region covered by Florida Today, means helping out NASA. Romney has pledged to do that without pledging to increase the budget. The ""flip-flop"" charge has cursed Romney for most of his national political life. It was the easiest hit on the candidate who, in 2007, was trying to introduce himself to skeptical Iowans and D.C. opinion leaders. A man in a Flipper costume shadowed Romney at the 2007 Conservative Political Action Conference, and if I rummage around I'm sure I still have the green ""Romney flip-flops"" handed out by his enemies. This was the start of the YouTube era. Finding video of Romney taking contradictory positions was downright easy. That continued until the evening of Oct. 3, right before Romney took the debate stage in Denver and promised ""not to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people"" and not to repeal popular parts of Obamacare. The next day, when Romney stopped by the micro-Conservative Political Action Conference in Denver, he got an ovation that didn't end until his speech was over. The right got it--Romney could flip-flop all he wanted as long as it meant he was beating Barack Obama. The newspaper endorsements are just the icing. ""Romney has famously flip-flopped on abortion rights, the need for Planned Parenthood, access to contraceptives and health care reform in general, which disproportionately affects single mothers and lower-income women,"" editorialized the Nashville Tennessean. ""During his bruising primary campaign he veered to the right; in the debates, he has swung back to his moderate stances as governor of Massachusetts. The Romney who was governor reflected the attitudes shared by a majority of Americans; this is where he should stay, if elected, and resist pressure from the 'tea-vangelicals' in his party who want to take this country back to the repressed 1950s."" Would he resist? The editorial writers don't know. But they know that he should. And to be overly fair, this was the thrown-together logic that got a record number of newspapers behind Obama in 2008. But the biggest reversals come from papers that now put more faith in Romney than they ever put in Obama. ""The worst thing that many critics say about Romney is that he is too flexible,"" argued the Long Beach Press-Telegram, ""that he bends his policies to the situations in front of him. As president, Romney would not be restrained by foolish consistency. He would be expected to do the right thing no matter where the solutions originate."" The flip-flops are part of the reason why Romney can now be trusted.* It's an odd view of the president and the presidency. The switchers pay almost no attention to Romney's advisers. One example: His running mate is Paul Ryan, who led the budget committee in the House for the last two years. Ryan is rarely mentioned in these editorials, which means his voting record on spending or social issues never gets mentioned. ""We've been turned off by his appeals to social conservatives and immigration extremists,"" wrote the Orlando Sentinel's editorial board, before asserting that these appeals were phony. Romney had shifted his focus, which ""at least shows he understands that reviving the economy and repairing the government's balance sheet are imperative,"" and so he got the endorsement. Most of these papers have this in common: They stop the clock on Romney's ""real"" beliefs in 2006, and they restart it on Oct. 3. ""He stated his unequivocal support for women's contraception rights,"" wrote the Quad-City Times, ""knowing it would incense a huge number of Christian and Catholic voters."" This was a reference to a terrifically slippery Romney answer in the Hofstra debate: ""I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not."" Before that debate, Romney had dramatically opposed the HHS rule that mandates contraceptive coverage in employer-run health care, telling audiences that it amounted to ""an attack on religious freedom."" Florida Today told readers that Romney ""showed support for women and gay people"" in the debates. This is true. He's also pledged, to the National Organization for Marriage, to keep judges away from the bench if they don't oppose gay nuptials. These newspapers are convinced: The Real Mitt Romney is a moderate who got one over on conservative primary voters. But Romney himself can't ever say this. In March, Romney's key strategist Eric Fehrnstrom told CNN that the old, conservative stances of the primary would be easy to shake off, just like a drawing can be shaken off an Etch-a-Sketch. And what did Fehrnstrom do for a living before he started working for Romney? He was a newspaper reporter.

How Mitt Romney Turned Flip-flopping Into a Virtue

Seven days to go: Today's Good News for Romney: With a week until Election Day, it's time get your base excited and ready to go. Romney has a slight edge on that front, according to a Pew poll released yesterday. Among registered voters, Obama leads 47 percent to 45 percent. But among likely voters, the race is a dead heat: 46-46. That's because 76 percent of Republicans reported that they were likely to vote, and only 62 percent of Democrats did. The Pew poll report suggests Republicans are more enthusiastic about Romney since the debates, and they find the race more interesting and informative than they did in June. If Romney can get all of these Republicans to the polls, he might be able to maintain that edge in the final count. See Mitt Romney's earlier rays of hope. See Barack Obama's earlier rays of hope.

Eight days to go: Today's Good News for Obama: As Hurricane Sandy hurtles toward the East Coast, Mitt Romney has canceled all campaigning in Virginia for the foreseeable future, axing his intended tour through the critical swing state. The timing couldn't be worse for Romney: A new poll shows Obama leading the Republican challenger 51 percent to 47 percent among likely voters, recovering a lead that had disappeared throughout most of October. Other polls show the candidates at a dead heat, but the momentum in Old Dominion appears to be in Obama's favor during the closing days of the election. Romney is missing a valuable chance to make closing arguments in Virginia, giving Obama the opportunity to nab the state's highly coveted 13 electoral votes on Nov. 6.

5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/hurricane_sandy_barack_obama_and_mitt_romney_are_trying_to_navigate_the.html	"Hurricane Sandy has interrupted the campaign, which makes her the most important woman in the swing states. Politics has taken a pause, but we all know it's a temporary one. It's unseemly to talk about politics with so many people about to face genuine danger. Then again, this campaign already has broken a lot of old rules. Candidates used to be loosely constrained by the facts. Not so much any more. Candidates used to be prohibited from making political attacks during a fresh national security crisis. So it seems inevitable that Sandy will become a political force. It's also fitting for a campaign that has so often felt like a skirmish on the side stage that here we are facing deadly realities. In a sense, though, this storm touches on what this campaign has always been about: What should the federal government do, and does it have the resources to do it? We are eight days away from an election. This is the 2012 campaign's October surprise. (Though given the way this campaign has unfolded, there might be a November surprise.) Natural disasters can hit presidents in two ways. In 2004, President Bush visited victims of Hurricane Francis in early September as his party was holding its convention. He played the first responder role then. A year later, Hurricane Katrina sidetracked his presidency. If presidents get more blame for a weak economy than perhaps they deserve, there are also moments when there are political benefits to the office. In times like this, Americans--Democrat and Republican alike--turn to government. President Obama pulled himself off the campaign trail on Monday and returned from Florida before he attended a single event. He's not campaigning for at least two days. For the moment, in the major story of the day, he has a key role. As I type this, word has arrived from the White House that the president is in the Situation Room talking with his advisers, and as I review it, he has just finished speaking to reporters in the briefing room. ""I'm not worried at this point about the impact on the election,"" said the president. ""I'm worried about the impact on families."" Still, there will be some poetical cost or gain based on how his administration manages the disaster that all the forecasters say is coming. (Political scientists have even measured this.) What does Mitt Romney do? Before the storm hit, he was trying to build the sense of a campaign that is rising as it approaches the finish line. His supporters are fired up like never before, but he's not gaining on the president as he did after the first debate. Nate Silver says they have returned to the condition they were in during the spring and summer, which puts Obama in the better position. Romney needs to create a bandwagon effect to lure undecided voters. He has canceled his campaign events Monday and Tuesday. In the interim, it's hard to stay in the story without looking like he's seeking political gain. His campaign informed reporters that he was on the phone with the governors of Virginia and New Jersey monitoring the situation. It's not quite clear what ""monitoring"" means in this context since he has no formal role to pay. (As I type this from Washington, a gust caused the windows to make such a noise that I thought it was the door opening.) Romney has also suspended his campaign fundraising emails into the affected states, as has the president. All of this stopped activity doesn't mean that the campaigns aren't trying to skewer each other under the table. In Ohio, they are engaged in a heated fight over the auto bailout, an important issue in the state where the economy is closely tied to the car industry. On Sunday, the Romney campaign released an ad suggesting Chrysler, a company saved in the bailout and sold to Fiat, would be making cars in China. It was an extension of a false claim made by Romney that the firm would be making all cars in China. The Obama campaign responded with its own ad. Romney has been talking a lot about bipartisanship lately on the stump. It appeals to those undecided, married, suburban voters he and the president need in the battleground states. The president has been trying to sound this theme, too. If they were both serious about appealing to those voters, you could imagine one candidate offering to have his volunteers join with the other campaign in a relief effort in the hardest-hit areas of the states. The campaign that didn't think of this first would probably decline, giving the one that suggested the joint army of altruism the opportunity to look above it all while causing no practical problem for the campaign. The only problem for a candidate who made this offer would be if the other campaign agreed to it. It would deprive whichever campaign was losing of important manpower to get out the vote. OK, back from fantasyland. The presidency has a performance aspect to it, especially during times of crisis, so evaluating the candidates now in a political context is part of evaluating them for the job they will hold. But there's also a practical effect of the storm. It may hamper early voting, and it may limit the organization-building benefits of candidate visits. The rains and winds could keep people from their polling places in North Carolina, and if the winter storm kicks up in Ohio, that could affect in-person voting there, too. It could also affect the door-to-door canvassing that's supposed to take place in those states. Virginia is the only state affected by the storm that has absentee voting, which requires an excuse and doesn't really take place in person, so the state won't be affected as much as the others. Two days of no campaign events means two days when the candidate can't be used to attract voters. When candidates come to town, it initiates a range of organizing efforts--including busing voters to the polls after rallies--that won't take place if the candidate isn't in town. Bill Clinton has stepped in for Obama during the crisis period, which might be a blessing. Clinton's convention speech was better received than Obama's acceptance speech because he is a more articulate spokesman. On the eve of the storm, Clinton told voters in Connecticut: ""We're coming down to the 11th hour. We're facing a violent storm. It's nothing compared to the storm we'll face if you don't make the right decision in this election."" Any disruption in the early vote or ability to harness candidate visits would probably hurt Democrats. Their voters are harder to turn out, so each day lost is a lost chance to get someone to the polls. On the other hand, if I'm home all day in Ohio, I might have the time to mail in that ballot I've had sitting on the dresser. Now we wait. It is temping to think that politics will be the last thing on people's minds in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, but that's as unrealistic as thinking if I step outside right now I won't get wet."	Why Hurricane Sandy Is the Most Important Woman in the Swing States

Clark Government Center in downtown. At 7 a.m., he will help lead south Florida's first early-vote rally. As soon as he can, he will hotfoot it to the South Dade Regional Library, 30-odd minutes away, for the day's second early-vote rally. He will find some way to flee in time to make the start of the EBA Higher Education Awareness and Dropout Prevention Initiative in Miami Gardens, the heart of black south Florida, and take the stage next to Rev. Al Sharpton. Then back on the road, north to Broward County. The plan, coordinated by at least 150 black pastors, is called ""Operation Lemonade."" On Wednesday, I visited New Birth, parking near the van that promotes his radio talk show, and finding Curry's office in the sprawling, 10-year-old gated complex. Outside the chapel, there's a signed message from President Obama congratulating Curry on the church's anniversary. Inside Curry's office, there are multiple pictures commemorating his meetings with Sharpton and with Bill Clinton, next to his lifetime membership plaque from the NAACP, and a picture from election night 2008. That year, churches got two whole weeks to turn out the early vote. This year they get one. ""When the Republicans in the state passed the new voting laws, we discovered that they took away that Sunday right before the election,"" says Curry. ""What we decided to do was view that as them giving us a lemon. We can be sour, we can moan and groan about it, or we can do something. We can make lemonade. The first thrust is this weekend, Saturday and Sunday, and then we're going to encourage people the entire next week."" Democrats are proud to say it: If they win this election, it'll be because a superior ground game turned out their base and overcame a Mitt Romney comeback. In Florida, they have twice as many campaign offices as Romney-Ryan. ""With absentee ballot requests, usually the Republicans have a pretty significant advantage on us,"" says Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the DNC chairwoman who represents a liberal slice of the Miami sprawl. ""We've cut the advantage by 85 percent."" This is true. And they had to battle to get there. From the moment Republicans took office in 2011, controlling gubernatorial and election offices in swing states, they started tightening voting laws. In Pennsylvania, the state passed its first-ever requirement for voter ID at the polls. In Ohio, the state attempted to eliminate early-voting days for anyone not serving in the military. In Florida, it took only two months to pass a comprehensive bill that scaled back early-voting days, prevented voters from changing their addresses when they got to the polls, and started a 48-hour countdown that required voter-registration campaigns to turn in their forms within two days or pay fines--a de jure response to ACORN paranoia. That bill was filed on March 7 and become law two months later. The Florida law became infamous. After the League of Women Voters gave up on registering voters, The Daily Show sent a reporter down to make fun of the 48-hour rule. According to a summer report by the Third Way think tank, Democrats lost 246,934 Florida voters after November 2008, and Republicans had lost only 71,829. But after November 2011, when the 48-hour law went into effect, Democrats lost 8,044 registrants; Republicans gained 18,303. And then the Democrats got the rules reversed. In June, a Florida court struck down the 48-hour rule. In September, the state gave up on an error-filled purge of voter registrations. October was a sloppy rout for voter restrictions, as the Pennsylvania and Ohio laws were halted. ""We won in court just when we were ramping up registration,"" says Wasserman Schultz. ""In Florida, we have 520,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans. If you look at the registration of Hispanic voters, since November of 2008, 195,000 Hispanic voters have registered as Democrats or independents."" And they still have the early-voting days--less of them, but they have them. In the meantime, they have made the ""voter suppression"" efforts infamous among their base voters. In the area around Curry's church, I find black voters who were completely aware of the laws and could recite the ways the state had tried to block their votes. ""My son had an incident eight years ago,"" says Valerie Gardner, a real estate agent in the area, ""and because of that he can't vote. We went to vote and the state had never told him that he couldn't."" So in response, she helped out Operation Lemonade as much as she could that morning before heading to a wedding. ""I think that this whole thing is gonna backfire on 'em,"" says Curry. ""If they had left it alone, African-Americans may have been less excited about this election than they were about 2008."" Take the fear of disenfranchisement away and they might have been skittish about voting for a president who endorses gay marriage. In other states, like Maryland and Washington, there are campaigns directed at black voters that straddle the line between patronizing and true. But in Florida, where the Obama campaign is running an ad to remind people of the 2000 election, it doesn't play. ""Just because he says he's for gay marriage doesn't mean he's going to implement it,"" says Rev. Gary McCleod of the nearby Mount Sinai church. ""That doesn't concern people."" I leave Miami and drive to West Palm Beach. The South Florida Tea Party keeps its office on Clematis Street, and the guest tonight is from the Texas-based poll-watching conservative coalition True the Vote. Adryana Boyne became an American citizen by marriage in 1992, and cast her first presidential vote for George H.W. Bush. This year, at the Republican National Convention, Craig Romney invited her to sit near the family for Mitt's nomination speech. South Florida Tea Party chairman Everett Wilkinson apologizes to her, because he'd wanted to do more Tea Party outreach to Hispanic voters for months, ""and we're getting a late start."" Boyne nods sadly, then rallies to record a 10-minute video explaining to Hispanic voters that the Democrats are lying to them when they talk about restrictions. ""We have people, the snowbirds, who live in two states, and they're voting twice,"" she says. ""We know what happened a few years ago with ACORN. Remember? That's still going strong. People say: Just go register anyone. Do you have a driver's license? You can register to vote. That's not true. You have to be a citizen of the United States."" After the video is done, I join Wilkinson, Boyne, and Boyne's friend Juan Fiol for a very late dinner. Fiol, who's been working for Wasserman Schultz's opponent Karen Harrington, is even more frustrated than Boyne. Democrats, he says, are pandering to Hispanics, scaring them away from Republicans, claiming that there's no such thing as fraud. ""Early voting enables fraud,"" he says. ""There's a certain number of fraudsters. Let's say there's 100. They go out the first day, they commit 100 frauds. OK? But let's say it's seven days. It becomes 700 frauds. It becomes 14 days, and it's 1,400 frauds. In Ohio, it's open for a month! C'mon, man!"" Four years ago, Republicans were saying the same thing. John McCain used precious time in his final debate with Barack Obama to attack ACORN--its dodgy registration reforms were a ""threat to democracy."" McCain didn't win, but the effect was to make Republicans as angry and paranoid about the threat to their votes as Democrats ever were. One poll, taken a year after Obama won, found that 52 percent of Republicans credited it to ACORN fraud. The new voter ID/voter-registration laws were supposed to fix that. In the process, they helped Democrats convince their wavering base that their ballots were in danger. They've absorbed the lesson even as the laws loosened up. ""The law in Florida was a kneejerk reaction,"" says Wilkinson. ""It ended up deterring voter registration. We, as an organization, weren't able to overcome that."" But the Democrats may have overcome it, and that success just might rescue them."	Why the GOP's Voter Suppression Schemes May Be Good for Democrats

Right now, he doesn't have it. That's a huge problem for the president, who must now rely on massive minority turnout to win 270 electoral votes. Democratic presidential candidates in the modern era have never been popular among white voters--Obama only earned 41 percent of their votes in 2008--but this year marks a startling low unmatched since Walter Mondale's landslide defeat. The disparity is particularly acute among white men, only 32 percent of whom support Obama. Meanwhile, Mitt Romney has locked down the support of at least 60 percent of white voters and 65 percent of white men, meaning Obama has only 2 to 3 percent of undecided white voters left to woo.

8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/mittmentum_mitt_romney_s_presidential_campaign_is_drawing_huge_enthusiastic.html	"DEFIANCE, Ohio--There's a moment that arrives now and again in presidential campaign speeches when the candidate says, ""If I'm president,"" and then corrects himself: ""when I'm president."" This is a crowd favorite and usually gets a healthy round of cheers. Then the candidate moves on. When Mitt Romney said this on Thursday morning in Cincinnati, the crowd reacted as if it was election night and he'd just been declared president--and they'd been given a new car. For 30 seconds, they screamed and cheered. As we enter the final sprint, campaigns and their supporters will sustain themselves on sweeping crowd shots of supporters cheering on their man. At the Romney rally on a football field in Defiance, Ohio, the campaign had a camera hooked to a drone to get sweeping crowd shots. So far this campaign we've had fights over facts, and then it was a fight over the polls. Now we're having a fight over momentum. Who has the larger crowd? Who has more enthusiasm? Trying to read a crowd is mostly a mug's game. I remember attending a John McCain event in Appleton, Wis., in 2008 that made the ground shake in the gymnasium. McCain lost Wisconsin by 14 points. Still, for Mitt Romney, who was once considered merely a tepid vessel of anti-Obama feeling and who had trouble in the primaries stirring the party faithful, he's peaking at the right time. The lines snake through neighborhoods and people leave hoarse and buoyant. It used to be that his crowds were most excited when he said mean things about Barack Obama. Now that's not what is getting most of the cheers. They cheer for Romney, the guy up there on stage. What makes crowd size and enthusiasm so alluring is that everyone is flying blind about Ohio, looking for a sign somewhere that the state is going their way. Both campaigns believe the polls are essentially tied. Recently the debate in Ohio has focused on which party is doing better in early voting. Democrats say they are exceeding their 2008 levels. Republicans say Democrats are just capturing the voters that were already going to vote for Obama and not using the early voting period to win over low propensity voters. (I wrote about this Thursday.) Campaign aides say they are ""exceeding their metrics,"" which means they've knocked on more doors, put up more signs, or made more phone calls than they expected to make. But you can exceed your metrics and lose because the other guy is exceeding his metrics, too. Romney is using Obama's 2008 campaign against him. He's trying to steal the change mantle from the president. The word change cropped up a dozen times in two speeches, and Romney regularly shakes his head at how low the author of Hope and Change has fallen. ""His campaign gets smaller and smaller,"" he says, ""Our campaign is about big things. We happen to believe that America faces big challenges ... Americans want to see big changes and that's what I'm going to bring."" The day ended for Romney on that football field at Defiance High School. The scoreboard read 4th down, 12 to go, referring to the number of days left in the campaign. After the national anthem was sung, fireworks launched behind the end zone. And then Meatloaf took the stage. ""Never before have I endorsed a single candidate until now,"" said the 65-year-old singer of ""Bat Out of Hell"" and ""Two Out of Three Ain't Bad,"" who said that after the last debate he couldn't stay on the sidelines given the ""storm clouds rising over the world."" Before he left the stage, he said he had called three Democrats and convinced two of them to vote for Romney. ""So two out of three ain't bad,"" he said."	Why Mittmentum Is Real

STOP OBAMA."" A cartoon map of Israel, colored white and blue and decorated with a Star of David, is being hit by an ICBM. On I-95, the route up to the heart of south Florida's Jewish heartland, you see more signs in the same garish colors portraying the president bowing to a Saudi prince. The billboards are paid for by the American Principles super PAC. A photo of the one I saw led a spooky New York Times story this week as an example of the ""strident messages"" arriving in swing states. It's also an example of how the noise of this campaign outmatches the signal. The PAC has reported only $126,000 in funds and handed most of it over to CBS Outdoor, the billboard company. Emails to its official address bounce back; phone calls to their offices ricochet off a full file of voice mail. The campaign to turn nervous Jews against Barack Obama's Democrats might turn out to be a bust. And after such high hopes! The president's relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu has been one long Adam Sandler movie of pratfalls and accidental insults. In July, a Gallup poll gave Obama a meager 64-29 lead among Jewish voters. It was, as the Palm Beach-based Newsmax pointed out, the worst Democratic showing since Michael Dukakis. A result like that could've meant tens of thousands fewer votes for Obama in Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Nevada. But it didn't last. A mid-September Gallup poll, obtained by Buzzfeed, gave the president a 70-25 lead with Jewish voters. That's about what he won in 2008. In the final presidential debate, Mitt Romney only mentioned Israel after the president brought it up and then said, ""I think the tension that existed between Israel and the United States was very unfortunate."" In general, he went lighter on the issue than in past foreign policy speeches. ""I thought, ""Wow, he must be confident about winning Florida,"" says Ana Navarro, a Miami-based Republican strategist. ""He left a lot of Israel on the table. He left Cuba on the table."" She mentions another billboard campaign, by the better-funded Republican Jewish Coalition, which has spent at least $4.5 million in the general election stretch on ads that show purportedly disappointed Obama voters on silly pun-filled billboards. ""I don't think those OBAMA? OY VEY! signs were swaying many people,"" says Navarro. Democrats--who, let's be fair, have been spinning this for years--argue that Obama was already winning the argument and used the debate to spike the ball. Romney's trump card on Israel was that Obama failed to visit Israel on his Middle East tour, and Israelis noticed. ""I went to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust museum there, to remind myself the nature of evil and why our bond with Israel will be unbreakable,"" said the president. ""And then I went down to the border towns of Sderot, which had experienced missiles raining down from Hamas.""* He talked about the military exercise team-ups between the two countries and the Iron Dome defense system, and the round was over. ""Talking about Yad Vashem--that resonates with Jewish voters, especially when he pronounces it correctly,"" says former Rep. Robert Wexler, the overtaxed Obama surrogate on Israel issues. ""It resonates when he explains why he then was motivated to spend money on the Iron Dome."" Rep. Ted Deutch, who holds Wexler's old seat, already talks about the ""dump Obama"" campaign in the past tense. ""There's been an awful lot of money spent by super PACs, by Sheldon Adelson, and by a lot of shadow groups, in south Florida especially, to try to make the president's record on Israel look like something other than what it really is."" The battle for Florida's Jews is best seen from the new 22nd Congressional District, a long swath of small cities and suburbs that stretches from the Palm Beach area down 60 minutes south to Fort Lauderdale. For two years it's been represented by Rep. Allen West, ever since he humiliated Jewish incumbent Democrat Ron Klein in the Tea Party wave. Then the state tweaked the district and moved some conservative suburbs into other districts. The new 22nd had given 57 percent of its vote to Obama in 2008. West jumped to the 18th District, packed with conservatives who struggle to describe how much they adore their new congressman. This forces the 22nd to choose between Democrat Lois Frankel and Republican Adam Hasner. Both are Jewish. Both were born in New York. Hasner came to Florida with his family in 1975; Frankel arrived in 1974. The Democrat, who's 64, was elected mayor of West Palm Beach after leading the party's diminishing delegation to the state House. Hanser, 42, helped Marco Rubio run the growing Republican majority. She spent half the campaign running against West; Hasner spent half the cycle running for U.S. Senate. And now they're in a race where the Israel issue is a wash, hard for a Democrat to lose. At a forum last week with Jewish voters, Hasner tried to win it anyway. ""I was one of the first in the country to say, 'No more money to a Hamas-led Palestinian Authority,' "" he said. "" 'No more money to a Muslim Brotherhood-led Egypt.' "" And when ""the Democratic National Convention decided to remove Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, I asked Lois Frankel to join me in recognizing that this was a bipartisan issue. She remained silent."" Frankel, whose New York accent has never been softened, laughed that off. ""Mr. Hasner, I hate to admit this,"" she said, ""but I've been supporting Israel for longer than you've been born."" It's a dodge, and it sort of works. Frankel's so happy with it that she repeats the line when I join her on a tour of West Palm Beach. It's only the top of the district, but it is populated, to an eerie degree, with people who know ""Lois!"" by name and ask her if she's won yet. The city library, built during her tenure, is decorated with her own abstract paintings. She frequently puts her hand on my shoulder and points out what's ""awesome""--the computer room, the new downtown restaurants, the park where the old library used to be, the wine bar owned by her son. She bluntly explains that she's going to win the non-West Palm Beach parts of the districts with her TV ads and that the Israel issue's a wash. ""If you look at Congress, it's not a partisan issue,"" she says. ""If you look at AIPAC, they're not partisan. We do Israel a disservice to make it partisan. And I'm not going to use it for a partisan advantage. I say Adam Hasner is a great supporter of Israel, and I'm a great supporter of Israel."" And in a short interview, when I ask about Israel, Hasner mostly moves on. ""I don't think the Jewish vote is atypical,"" he says. ""I think President Obama has lost support across the spectrum. I think Jewish voters are right in line with re-evaluating their support based on a multitude of issues, including the economy."" Indeed, in Hasner's latest ad, a woman tells voters that Frankel spent $13,000 to remodel a bathroom then flushes the toilet she's sitting on. ""When you gotta go,"" she says, ""you gotta go."" It's not quite a nuclear missile headed at Tel Aviv. Correction, Oct. 25, 2012: This article misidentified the town Obama said he visited in Israel. It is Sderot, not Storok."

The Centennial State may remain too close to call, but with the election fewer than two weeks away, Romney has a slight but potentially firm lead over Obama. Real Clear Politics' poll average gives Romney a miniscule .2 percent advantage, but Rasmussen has the Republican presidential candidate at 50 percent over Obama's 46 percent. Romney has noticed: His campaign is hitting Colorado hard this week and is encouraging huge crowds of enthusiastic supporters to carry Republicans over the finish line. The polls are on Romney's side, and this last push could be the one that delivers the state back into GOP hands. See Mitt Romney's earlier rays of hope. See Barack Obama's earlier rays of hope.	Why Today Was a Good Day for Mitt Romney
12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/barack_obama_wants_to_paint_mitt_romney_as_a_man_who_can_t_be_trusted.html	"DELRAY BEACH, Fla.--President Obama moved from center stage to center court Tuesday. The day after the third and final debate, Obama started his day at a tennis stadium grinning under the waves of adulation from an eager and approving crowd. The night before, the president was all sharp elbows and crisp declarations about world affairs, but for those arrayed in the bleachers surrounding him on all sides, he was in full campaign mode, joking, switching accents, and returning to the perils of Romnesia--less Situation Room and more The Situation. Under a peekaboo sun, the president said Romney was doing the Okie-Doke, playing hide and seek with his true plans. ""Last night we had a stage 3 case,"" he said, in a mock diagnosis of his opponent's condition. ""If you can't seem to remember the policies on your website, you might have Romnesia. If you can't even remember what you said last week, you might have Romnesia."" Obama wasn't just revisiting a comedy routine he'd unveiled for the first time last Friday, he was trying to explain exactly why this deficiency made Romney unfit to be president. ""This is about trust,"" he said. ""There is no more serious issue in a presidential campaign than trust. The person who leads this country you've got to have some confidence that he or she means what she says. What they believe that they are going to do it. You want someone to look you in the eye and say, 'Here's what I stand for. Here's what I'll fight for. Here's what I care about. Here's who I'm going to look out for in the debates in Washington.' "" The message is that if you think there's something you like about Romney, he can't be trusted to deliver. But Obama is also trying to redefine the race. It's not about foreign affairs or the economy. It's about trust. There's still a tension in this line of attack. If Romney is not to be believed, then why should people weigh the things he says that are very conservative over the things that he says that are less so? Couldn't it be possible that the moderate-sounding guy who is willing to rearrange his policies and emphasis for a few debates might be a similarly pragmatic president? No, say Obama strategists, he's got a conservative core; what can't be trusted is anything that he does that suggests otherwise. ""He knows he can't sell his beliefs,"" Obama said at a rally in Dayton, Ohio later on Tuesday. ""So he's doing everything he can to hide his true positions."" The president brought a new diagnosis of his opponent and a new pamphlet of old policies. A glossy brochure is being sent to more than 3 million swing-state voters outlining his plans for the next term. Inside, Obama is dressed in casual Friday clothes meeting with women, children, the elderly, and people involved in purposeful economic pursuit--a small businesswoman and people in lab coats Gov. Romney has said the president has no ideas for the future, and even some of Obama's allies make that charge. The brochure was the latest attempt to correct that impression. Obama had tried the night before too, making a few detours in the foreign policy debate to outline his domestic plans in bullet-point fashion. The agenda is not a mystery. Obama has been promoting it for more than a year: investment in manufacturing, education, infrastructure, energy production, and a trillion dollar start on shrinking the deficit. The American people either haven't been listening, or don't find what he's selling very attractive. There is one other possibility. The search for Obama's policies may be like a weekend trip to the refrigerator. You open it again and again, staring inside for a minute before you close it once more, unmoved and still hungry. Sometimes it takes another person to come along and point out that there really is something in there to eat, you've just been missing it. Republicans immediately dismissed the policies in the document as warmed over. True, but doesn't that undermine the argument that Obama doesn't have any plans? Being warmed over may be a disqualifying characteristic, but if old ideas are bad ideas, then Romney's 20 percent reduction in tax rates is in danger. Marginal rate reductions are hardly a new idea. Indeed, it appeals to Republicans because it has a whiff of Reagan. When the president said that Romney shouldn't be concerned about Romnesia because Obamacare covers pre-existing conditions, the crowd erupted with such delight that it felt for a moment like we'd been transported to one of those 2008 Obama rallies. Obama left the stage with a bounce. He was clearly having a blast. In this final stretch of the campaign, he will almost certainly have the advantage over his opponent in sheer performance energy at campaign events. Romney can turn out a crowd and they've been getting bigger since his successful Denver debate, but he just doesn't put on the show that Obama does. Some people in the audience had been waiting in line for six hours, and judging from the constant and sustained applause, they felt the wait was worth it. ""I believe in you,"" said the president, ""and I need you to believe in me."""	It's about trust. That's President Obama's message for the home stretch.

But in swing states, the numbers are now on Obama's side. Gas prices actually fell 9 cents last week, and in eight swing states, gas prices are below the national average of $3.72 a gallon. As for jobs, unemployment rates have fallen in nine swing states in the past month. What's more, Virginia, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Iowa all benefit from lower gas prices and unemployment below the national average. Obama may be more than happy if Romney chooses to keep pointing to gas prices and unemployment figures in these vital states. See Barack Obama's earlier rays of hope.

14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/third_presidential_debate_barack_obama_won_the_final_debate_but_mitt_romney.html	"Mitt Romney brought a knife to a gunfight. A butter knife. In the third and final presidential debate, focused on national security and foreign policy, the Republican challenger seemed to be living by the Hippocratic oath: Do no harm. In this case that meant a mostly passive, heavy-on-agreement discussion with his opponent the commander in chief. President Obama, by contrast, was on the attack, repeatedly calling Romney reckless and looking every bit like the politician who thinks he's behind in the race. President Obama won the third debate, articulating his policies more forcefully, offering more detail and a coherent foreign policy rationale. Romney generally presented bromides and talking points in a style that was at times tentative. When he talked about foreign policy, Romney occasionally sounded like a student trying to prove that he'd crammed for the test, rattling off the names of countries and bullet points he'd recently committed to memory. In the end though, the political question is not who won the policy debate on foreign policy, but whether Romney cleared the bar as a plausible commander in chief. Voters are going to hire him based on his ability to handle the economy, which means he does not need to be as competent on a secondary issue like foreign policy. He just has to be acceptable. What does acceptable mean? For Romney, it probably meant no mistakes (and there were no obvious gaffes). The country will now return to talking about the economy, the issue he wants to talk about. The immediate exit polls were mixed. CBS polled undecided voters and they gave the night to Obama, 53 percent to 23 percent. CNN's poll of registered voters gave the narrow edge to Obama, 48 percent to 40 percent. While Obama called Romney reckless several times, there was nothing the former Massachusetts governor did or said that seemed reckless. After the first debate, Romney campaign strategists said that voters might not have followed the specifics of Romney's plans but liked that he had them. In the third debate, Romney was hoping that his vague but confident pronouncements would do nothing to frighten undecided voters, even if it did cost him the Council on Foreign Relations crowd. And he took no risks by mounting a serious and sustained challenge of the president. In the CBS poll, 49 percent said Romney could be trusted in an international crisis. That was only a few points above what people thought going in to the debate. If he's clearing the acceptability bar, that number suggests it's not by much. When Romney talked about non-foreign-policy issues during one of the debate's many cul-de-sacs into domestic policy, it was like a switch had been thrown. He once again sounded more confident. Romney so thoroughly abandoned the aggressive, fact-checking style that got him into trouble with the president over Libya in their second meeting, it was hard to imagine they were the same candidate. Moderator Bob Schieffer raised tougher questions in his introduction of the topic than Romney ever did. Obama was able to even use Libya as an example of his foreign policy approach, which he argued showed what you could accomplish if you tend to your allies. ""I and Americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to, without putting troops on the ground at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in Iraq, liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years."" Like a boxer hugging his opponent to kill time, Romney signaled agreement with Obama on Syria, Iranian sanctions, defending Israel, Afghanistan, and the ouster of Hosni Mubarak. When he fought back against Obama's attacks, his stock phrase was generic and with an eye toward swing voters: ""Attacking me is not talking about an agenda."" (The Romney domestic policy critique is that Obama has no second-term domestic agenda, either.) Romney wasn't going to do anything to make suburban women, that key voting bloc, think that he was going to get into any wars. ""We can't kill our way out of this mess,"" said Romney about the Middle East. He talked about alliances, promoting foreign aid, and working to promote democracy. When he discussed domestic policy--on the pretext that America can only be strong abroad if the economy is strong at home--Romney stressed his desire to work with both parties and referred to his record of cooperating with Democrats in Massachusetts. Several times he made this point, which is aimed directly at swing-state women who approve of Romney's desire to work in a bipartisan way. ""Republicans and Democrats came together on a bipartisan basis to put in place education principles that focused on having great teachers in the classroom,"" said Romney. Bipartisanship and education: the double woman-voter pitch. Both candidates mentioned greater freedom for women in the Middle East several times. Just because there were no obvious Romney gaffes doesn't mean that Obama didn't get the better of him at times. The president treated Romney like a pretender with derisive asides. ""The 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back,"" Obama said, making fun of Romney's anti-Russia stance. When Romney talked about building more ships, the president took his pants down. ""You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916. Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines."" It was a regular theme; the message was that Romney was a novice and a dummy. ""I know you haven't been in a position to actually execute foreign policy--but every time you've offered an opinion, you've been wrong."" Domestic politics also came in to play in a debate over the auto bailout. There were several times when Romney decided not to answer Obama's claims. He simply let arguments pass by. After Obama launched into one long answer, Romney did try to pipe up. When Scheiffer said he'd had his say, Romney, who had moved past other moderators, said ""Well, that's probably true."" But when it came to the auto bailout, Romney defended himself vigorously against the charge that he wanted to let the auto industry go bankrupt. Partisans love this stuff, but do undecided voters? Do the voters who were with Obama in 2008, but think he's tarnished his brand? The ""bayonets"" line is actually tied to a policy idea--that a mindless defense buildup is sloppy, inefficient, and out of sync with the threats America faces. But voters might have been lost in the snark. Voters in Virginia, especially southeastern Virginia where they like Romney's plans for a bigger Navy, probably weren't laughing so much. Obama's best moment of the night was when he defended his foreign travel and told the story of visiting with Israeli families as a candidate. It was a strong moment because Obama combined force, a little umbrage taking, and a specific story that punctuated his claim that he was a strong ally of Israel. Another moment that may have connected with voters was when the president told the story about a young girl who last spoke to her father moments before the World Trade Tower collapsed on Sept. 11, 2001. ""For the next decade, she was haunted by that conversation,"" said the president. ""And she said to me, ""You know, by finally getting Bin Laden, that brought some closure to me."" A president who won the Nobel Peace Prize for doing very little in office spent much of the debate highlighting his military accomplishments. After the second debate, Romney's oldest son Tagg said he wanted to slug the president for the mean things he said about his father. After Monday night's debate, the president spoke to Tagg on stage, the two laughed, and at one point the young Romney's hand was on the president's back. It wasn't a gesture of menace, but collegiality. In a debate about war and diplomacy, in the end, diplomacy won out. Video Explainer: Does the U.S. military still use bayonets?

Six days to go: Today's Good News for Romney: In spite of passing a massive overhaul of America's health care system, Barack Obama is increasingly mistrusted to manage Medicare and Medicaid, according to a new poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Only 46 percent of likely voters were confident that Obama would handle Medicare better than his Republican opponent, while 41 percent preferred Romney to the president. That's a 5 point gain by Romney since September, and a startling 6 point drop for Obama in the same period of time. Similarly, Obama holds a mere 7 percent lead on the issue of handling Medicaid, down from 18 percent two months ago. And while likely voters still believe Obama will lower their health care costs more than Romney, the president's lead in that category has fallen precipitously, from 16 points in September to 7 points now. Romney's attempt to convince voters of his expertise on the issue has clearly been effective. That could be a crucial factor in a swing state like Florida, where a candidate's bona fides on Medicare might make or break his chances for office. See Mitt Romney's earlier rays of hope.

18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/charles_woods_conservative_groups_are_trying_to_use_the_tragic_story_of.html	"Six days ago, Charles Woods turned on his radio and heard an update on the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in Benghazi. Charles's son, Tyrone Woods, had been killed that day, jumping into the fray after hearing that the American consulate had been attacked. The father, who had chosen not to speak to the media, listened to the news and grew incensed. ""They mentioned that the president had live feed, that he watched my son being killed,"" Woods would tell Fox News weekend host Jeanine Pirro. ""That he watched this whole battle that lasted seven hours. And he chose to do nothing."" Woods called the station and got on with the host, Portland, Ore.-based conservative talker Lars Larson. In calm, even tones, he described the unimaginably sad story of his hero son taking a job despite the danger, responding to people who were ""crying for help,"" and being left to die by his own country. ""The whole feeling I got about this when it happened was 'we're not getting the truth,' "" said Woods. He described the president shaking hands ""like a dead fish,"" which maybe made sense, with ""this information coming out about videos being live-streamed, calls for help coming to the White House."" Over the rest of the week, Woods talked to Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Geraldo Rivera, and Laura Ingraham to tell and retell the story. When Obama talked to him, ""it wasn't in a powerful voice,"" said Woods to Hannity. ""It was more of just a whiney little voice--'I'm sorry.' You know? And I could tell by his voice he wasn't even sorry."" In the Ingraham interview, Woods says that the president couldn't even look him in the eye. The Woods interviews are devastating. No one whose blood runs warm can listen to them without reacting. On Facebook, conservatives have started meme-ifying Woods quotes and Benghazi rumors, altering Obama's campaign slogan (Forward) to read: ""COWARD."" For years, conservative critics of the president have portrayed him as a valor-stealing wimp who's actually ashamed of his country. Now they believe his government told Tyrone Woods to stand down, denied all requests for backup as Woods defied the order and fought, and then sat back remorselessly as good men died. But has anybody else--anybody who wasn't already inclined to distrust Obama--bought into this story? Not really, no. The Romney-Ryan ticket has nixed Libya from stump speeches. On Friday, when a Denver TV interviewer asked Obama about the ""stand down"" theory, and the president dodged, the Romney campaign commented on Obama's other answers and ignored ""Benghazi-gate."" Today, a new Pew poll on the election finds that Obama's numbers on foreign policy and leadership have ticked up since mid-October. Whom do voters ""trust to make wise decisions about foreign policy""? A four-point Obama lead has become an eight-point lead. The support for Obama's foreign policy decision-making becomes even stranger when you consider how long this narrative has been building. Over the summer, with great hype and a boost from Karl Rove's tweets, the Special Ops OPSEC Education Fund launched and pledged to expose ""how President Obama and those in positions of authority have exploited their service for political advantage."" Its latest ad, which went up on Oct. 3, rattles off some of the ways--""Hollywood producers briefed,"" ""administration leaks investigations,"" ""SEAL Team Six exposed."" Nobody from OPSEC got back to me when I asked whether that Libya ad would be joined by a new ad, making the ""Obama stood down"" case. But maybe this is the problem. The argument that Obama is listless and credit-stealing began before there was any good evidence for it. Ever since the Benghazi attacks, every fact or rumor has been slotted into the argument. Put the emphasis on ""every rumor."" The most chilling parts of Charles Woods' story are in dispute. That's good news for anyone who doesn't want to think that the government is run by sociopaths. Woods, for example, says that a surveillance drone gave a ""live-stream"" of the attacks for seven hours. There were two waves of attacks. According to CBS News, a surveillance drone was flown over Benghazi ""hours after the attack began."" Emails to the State Department, the ones that had diplomats reporting (not accurately) that a local terrorist group had taken credit, also suggest hours of confusion. And the White House completely denies the theory that the president watched the attacks while bouncing a tennis ball against the wall or something. ""The Situation Room part is completely wrong,"" says White House spokesman Tommy Vietor. ""No one watched video of the attack at the White House as it happened."" Whether you believe that depends on whether you believe anything this White House says. ""Benghazi-gate,"" like so many other stories of 2012, reads differently to people who accept different sources of authority. The most lurid, infuriating version of the Benghazi story appeared days after Woods started talking to the press, in a Fox News exclusive. In this version of the story, the CIA tells Woods to ""stand down""--something the CIA denies. But the administration doesn't sit out the crisis. ""An American Quick Reaction Force sent from Tripoli had arrived at the Benghazi airport at 2 a.m.,"" reports Fox, ""and was delayed for 45 minutes at the airport because they could not at first get transportation."" That reads like a failure. The fact that Ambassador Christopher Stevens had asked for more security at the consulate, and that this security was denied, was a failure--bad at the time, unconscionable in hindsight. And there's an undercurrent of scorn for Obama shared by conservatives and by skeptical veterans that colors the whole story. No Easy Day, the pseudonymous memoir of a SEAL Team Six member, ends with an anticlimactic story about the president awarding the Presidential Unit Citation. According to the author, Obama gave an address ""straight from the speechwriter playbook."" Biden ""kept cracking lame jokes that no one got."" They sound just like the schmucks who can't even give proper handshakes. Later, after a promised party at the White House never happens, the author's friend ""Walt"" laughs off the very idea that Obama can be trusted. ""You believed that shit. I bet you voted for change too, sucker."""	Can Conservatives Swiftboat Obama for Benghazi?

Eight days to go: Today's Good News For Romney: Every realistic path to victory for Mitt Romney includes North Carolina's 15 electoral votes; every realistic forecast of Hurricane Sandy involves it ripping through a swath of the Tar Heel State. And while the storm will keep both Democrats and Republicans indoors, Republicans have everything to gain from the resulting decrease in early voting. Democrats have already seized 49.5 percent of the early vote in the state, far outnumbering Republicans' 31.1 percent share. Obama has known all along that he'd have to rely on these early voters to have any shot of winning North Carolina. (He won it in 2008 with 14,000 votes, probably thanks to early voting.) Yet as the storm batters the state and shuts down early voting stations, Democrats are likely to lose much of their lead, as would-be early voters forego the dwindling opportunities to cast their ballots. North Carolina has hovered around a tie for much of the election, but Hurricane Sandy may have just delivered it for Romney. See Mitt Romney's earlier rays of hope.

20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/campaign_2012_will_obama_win_ohio_thanks_to_bush_v_gore.html	"One part of the story of the 2012 voting wars is well known: Republican legislatures have passed a series of laws making it at least modestly harder for people to vote. These GOP-inspired rules have included limits on early voting, stricter rules for voter registration, and new voter ID laws to stamp out unproven allegations of voter fraud. Less well-known is that courts have reined in some of these excesses, including a decision to block Texas's stringent voter ID law, an injunction putting Pennsylvania's voter ID law on hold for this election, and a settlement  blocking the worst of Florida's voter registration hurdles. The judicial record has been decidedly mixed. The Pennsylvania law will likely be approved by the 2014 elections, courts have allowed Republican secretaries of state to pursue purges of noncitizens from voting rolls despite ample evidence that the lists erroneously included many eligible voters, and federal courts recently refused to roll back Texas' tough new voter registration rules. But the fight over Ohio's election laws tells a different story. The Buckeye State has seen a rather remarkable string of wins for voting rights supporters. Federal courts have ordered the expansion of early voting and saved the votes of potentially thousands of voters who would have been disenfranchised because of poll worker errors, such as sending a voter to the wrong table to vote because the worker cannot tell an odd from an even number. Even more remarkably, the decisions from Democratic and Republican judges alike have relied on a very broad reading of Bush v. Gore, the Supreme Court case that ended the 2000 Florida recount in favor of George W. Bush. In fact, if President Obama narrowly ekes out a win in Ohio, he might have the conservative Supreme Court justices from 2000--Chief Justice Rehnquist, and Justices Scalia and Thomas--to thank for the victory. In Bush v. Gore, the Supreme Court stopped the recount of votes ordered by the Florida Supreme Court. Rehnquist, Scalia, and Thomas, the most conservative justices on the court, argued that the recount violated Article II of the U.S. Constitution, which gives state legislatures the power to set the rules for choosing presidential electors. These justices said Florida's recount violated Article II because it was done under standards set by the state's judiciary, not its legislature. Justices O'Connor and Kennedy did not buy the Article II argument. They rested their rationale for ending the recount on the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause, claiming that the changing and haphazard recount standards were arbitrary and ""valu[ed] one person's vote over that of another."" The court pointed to all kinds of problems and inconsistencies with the way various state counting boards were handling ""punch card ballots,"" which were run through computer counting machines that scanned where ""chads"" had been forced out. Rehnquist, Scalia, and Thomas signed on to this opinion too--otherwise there would not have been a majority endorsing any single reason for stopping the recount. It is this majority-supported Equal Protection holding that is now helping Obama in the home stretch of the 2012 race. For years, voting rights advocates have tried to make lemonade from lemons, arguing that the Equal Protection holding of Bush v. Gore should apply more broadly to require equality and uniformity in conducting elections. Until recently, these attempts have mostly met with failure, with courts reading the case's holding narrowly. Some argued that at most the opinion would apply to require uniform rules for conducting election recounts. So poorly had Bush v. Gore fared in the lower courts--the Supreme Court has never cited it for any purpose since it was decided--that I declared Bush v. Gore's untimely death in 2007. But in the last few years the opinion has been resurrected by the United States Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, the federal appellate court that includes Ohio.  In one recent case, a federal judge required Ohio to restore the last weekend of early voting, relying in part on Bush v. Gore's equal protection principles. The judge suggested that once Ohio had added the early voting days, it couldn't take them away, or at least couldn't take them away from everyone except military voters. The 6th Circuit appeals court agreed. One of the appellate judges went so far as to say that the reason Ohio could not take the early voting days away is because the state had a bad history of long lines at the polls in 2004, and the early voting in 2008 seemed to clear up this problem. That was an incredibly broad extension of equal protection principles, well beyond even generous readings of the Bush v. Gore precedent. Election law scholar Ned Foley, writing before the trial court's decision in the case, explained how under existing precedent the state should have won this case. Courts had long allowed states to draw distinctions among classes of voters with different burdens, and let states change rules like early voting hours for any legitimate reason. After Ohio surprisingly lost, the Supreme Court refused to intervene, perhaps believing the stakes were not high enough to get involved. Bush v. Gore also played an important role in the case in which the 6th Circuit held that the state of Ohio must count provisional ballots cast in the right polling location but the wrong ""precinct"" (which could be simply another table in the same gymnasium) because of poll-worker error. A panel of Republican judges unanimously declared, ""The State would disqualify thousands of right place/wrong-precinct provisional ballots, where the voter's only mistake was relying on the poll-worker's precinct guidance. That path unjustifiably burdens these voters' fundamental right to vote."" The result and broad equal protection ruling was a pleasant surprise. The state of Ohio has not yet decided whether it will take this case to the Supreme Court, but it has just decided to appeal a new follow-up ruling from the trial court in this case holding that even ballots cast because of poll-worker error in the wrong polling location (as opposed to merely the wrong precinct within a location) also must be counted.  If the election goes into overtime, I expect the state will continue to fight this ruling.  Provisional ballots won't even be counted until Nov.17, leaving plenty of time for litigation--and potentially the entire country hearing about the intricacies of Ohio election law as we await the winner of the presidential election. But in the meantime, these two rulings in Ohio could help give Obama the edge.  What the Republican legislatures have taken away, the federal courts, including some Republican judges, have restored, relying in part on the arguments conservative justices endorsed in Bush v. Gore."	Will Bush v. Gore Save Barack Obama?

Although that growth might not put a huge dent in unemployment, it confirms the country's slow but steady recovery from the Great Recession and gives Obama one more nice number to bandy about on the campaign trail. Even better, consumer spending is on the rise, suggesting that Americans are increasingly confident about the state of the economy. Democrats have already highlighted the GDP growth as proof that Obama's economic policies are working, and they may well help restore voters' confidence in the president during the final days of the election.

In a debate with Democratic opponent Joe Donnelly, Mourdock sought to explain his abortion stance by saying that ""even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that is something that God intended to happen."" Prior to that, Pennsylvania Senate candidate Tom Smith compared rape to having a baby out of wedlock, saying if you ""put yourself in a father's situation"" it's a similar kind of thing. And we all remember Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin telling an interviewer ""if it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down."" What do all these men have in common aside from the fact that they are GOP standard-bearers for the U.S. Senate? To one degree or another, they are Christian fundamentalists. The sheer number of these types of quotes that we've seen in 2012 got us wondering: Who says more antiquated things about women and families, Christian fundamentalists or Islamic fundamentalists?

24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/battleground_states_the_obama_and_romney_campaigns_must_choose_wisely_where.html	"As the presidential election heads into its final days, the most important decision strategists in both campaigns are making is where to send the candidate. There is no more precious resource: Every visit initiates a multilevel strategy to capture votes, voter information, and volunteers who can be squeezed for one more hour of effort. In this final stretch, the size of crowds at rallies can reach into the tens of thousands. The candidate's pitch is more urgent: What voters choose to do with their ballots will change the course of the nation. But beneath that vast sweeping feeling of history is an intense and focused game of gathering and sifting. To most of us, the attendees at a rally look like an undifferentiated blanket of people, but to those working the political ground game, it is a pixelated assortment of uncollected cellphone numbers, hands to work the phone banks, and sturdy legs to walk neighborhoods. In states with early voting, the people a candidate draws to a rally are fresh meat to be cajoled onto a bus and taken to a polling place. ""How about we get in our car, vote early, and bank our votes,"" said Sen. Rob Portman Thursday morning in Cincinnati, ""so that on Election Day we can make sure other people get out and vote."" In this process, the candidate is the flypaper. Before Barack Obama or Mitt Romney visit a town, their campaigns email supporters and targeted undecided voters. At a minimum, their teams will obtain a piece of private information, perhaps a cellphone number, that can be used to encourage someone to vote. Even better is if they can score a commitment from someone to vote early.  Best of all is if they can obtain a promise from that voter to volunteer for the campaign, thereby adding another foot soldier to the cause. The ticket to see the candidate is the bait. Voters can get them at the local campaign office. Once inside, a volunteer takes down as much information as possible and tries to secure those commitments for future volunteering. Campaigns are consumed with the idea that individual voters are motivated by community contact. Neighbor-to-neighbor appeals work the best. A campaign outpost in the neighborhood is effective because a voter is handed a ticket by someone who looks like them or shares their experiences. That is why the number of offices in a state can matter. (In Ohio, the Obama team has more than 120; Romney has about 40.) They expand a campaign's ability to make neighborhood connections. Every ticket has a code. When you show up and get your ticket scanned, the campaign knows it. Staffers with iPads will stop you to ask for more information like that all important cellphone number. (In the campaign vernacular, the voter is being ""caged"" for information.) If they don't convince you to get on the bus or drive to the early voting location after the rally, the campaign will contact you in the next several days. You're likely to get a phone call from someone who attended the rally and voted, asking you to do the same. When you are trying to gather every possible vote, it is more effective to begin the conversation with I see that we were both at the rally together than with the generic I'm calling in support of candidate X. But most rallies now are filled with the faithful who are already likely to vote. They represent a different opportunity. They can be used to make voter phone calls and contacts that are crucial in motivating all kinds of voters, though the biggest prize these days are ""low propensity voters."" These are people who have intersected with politics at some point and in some way--signing up on that web site or giving that small donation is  how they got on one of the party lists--but who aren't regular participants. These are the voters who take the most work to get to the polls, either because they are lazy, only mildly interested, or because they have complex allegiances. Maybe this resident of Canton voted for Ohio Gov. John Kasich but against his collective bargaining legislation. Both parties want that guy. Republicans know he's open to their team; Democrats know that he cares about unions. The Obama and Romney campaigns understand that if they are simply using the early voting period as a time to bank the votes of people who would otherwise have waited in line on Election Day then they are doing it wrong. The team that wins will be the one that grows the size of their vote. For Democrats, this is even more crucial. Polls show the president is doing better with registered voters than with likely voters. Obama needs to erase the distinction, or at least shrink it. At the Obama rally in Dayton on Tuesday, buses were lined up to take voters to local polling places as soon as the president left the stage. Romney aides kept a careful watch on the polling places in the area to see if there was a noticeable increase in activity. (They naturally say there wasn't as much as they would have expected; the Obama team claims the early voting in that area has far outstripped the totals from 2008.) If the Romney team did detect a lot of activity after the rally, they could redirect their efforts. They'd make more phone calls into those neighborhoods and surrounding suburbs, they'd send volunteers to knock on more doors, or they'd send a surrogate. If it were serious, they might mark the area with a big red X for a future visit from the candidate himself. How closely are the campaigns watching these early vote totals? The Romney campaign saw an uptick in votes in Belmont, an Ohio Democratic stronghold,  and worried party loyalists were rallying around Obama. They launched an investigation. Using the list the Ohio secretary of state releases each day of early voters, they called some of those who had voted and polled them. It turns out, according to a Republican source, that those voters were coming out to vote against the president and his coal policies. Finally, when the candidate comes to town it offers an opportunity to broadcast a message to undecided voters who might never attend a rally. ""Until he's commander in chief, he's persuader in chief,"" said one of Romney's top Ohio lieutenants about the candidate's visit to the state. Romney's job is to drive a message in local media that gets through to undecided voters. It is calibrated by looking at the state's most recent polling numbers so that the message can be aimed at white women or Hispanic voters. ""He needs to sound like their neighbor, too,"" says one local Obama staffer of the targeted messages fed to the president. ""That's what builds up trust."" It's also a chance to push for votes, as Romney did in Cincinnati on Thursday. ""I need you to find someone else who might be willing to vote for the other side,"" he said. ""Go out there and find some people, bring them to the polls. For someone who doesn't have a ride, get them to the polls."" As the days dwindle, the campaigns will be forced to make brutal decisions about where they should deploy their candidate. What states are in the greatest need of a visit? Based on last-minute polling data, which portions of a state are more important than others?  Could a presidential visit in some cases actually distract the army of volunteers from their last weekend duties of going door-to-door by pulling them to the rally and away from the neighborhoods? Soon some states will start to feel orphaned. Each campaign has enough money to keep buying television ads until the final day. The real test will be deciding whether the candidate comes to town."	Where a Candidate Spends His Time May Be All That Matters Now
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/how_the_presidential_race_between_barack_obama_and_mitt_romney_could_be.html	"""The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.""--Winston Churchill"" The 2012 presidential election looks like it could be a close one, whether in the Electoral College or the popular vote. When an election is tight, trying to understand voter behavior is all the more important. What exactly is it that makes voters reward a challenger or punish an incumbent?  Do they care about the unemployment rate, GDP, or inflation, or is it how those variables are moving? Are voters motivated by position papers or a candidate's personal history?  Is the electorate responding to slick TV ads or how the candidates performed in the debates? It may be something else altogether. Recent research has revealed that voter irrationality may be more arbitrary than we think. And in a razor-thin election just enough irrationality can make all the difference. Just how irrational are voters? It is statistically possible that the outcome of a handful of college football games in the right battleground states could determine the race for the White House. Economists Andrew Healy, Neil Malhotra, and Cecilia Mo make this argument in a fascinating article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. They examined whether the outcomes of college football games on the eve of elections for presidents, senators, and governors affected the choices voters made. They found that a win by the local team, in the week before an election, raises the vote going to the incumbent by around 1.5 percentage points. When it comes to the 20 highest attendance teams--big athletic programs like the University of Michigan, Oklahoma, and Southern Cal--a victory on the eve of an election pushes the vote for the incumbent up by 3 percentage points. That's a lot of votes, certainly more than the margin of victory in a tight race. And these results aren't based on just a handful of games or political seasons; the data were taken from 62 big-time college teams from 1964 to 2008. The good news, we suppose, is that sports really can cheer us up and make the world seem like a brighter place. The sports fan is left happier and more satisfied all around, not just on the gridiron. When you are feeling upbeat and happy, you feel more satisfied with the status quo in general. And feeling satisfied with the status quo makes you more likely to vote for the incumbent politician, even if that's totally irrational. The study's authors control for economic, demographic, and political factors, so the results are much more sophisticated than just a raw correlation. They also did a deeper analysis that took into account people's expectations. It turns out that surprise wins are especially potent, raising local support for incumbent politicians by around 2.5 percentage points. This phenomenon isn't limited to football. The authors also considered the 2009 NCAA Basketball Tournament and found broadly similar results. Another study looks at mayoral elections from 1948 to 2009 and analyzed those electoral contests against professional baseball, football, and basketball games. Again, if the local sports team is having a good year, it's a good bet that incumbents will see a bump on Election Day. No one is suggesting that college football or basketball games are the main determinants of elections. The Oklahoma University Sooners can go on a 100 game win streak and President Obama still won't carry Oklahoma. UCLA can lose big and Mitt Romney still wouldn't have a shot in California. Obviously, other factors besides the scores on ESPN SportsCenter matter a lot. But these results are still amazing. Because, as the authors point out, the government has nothing to do with the game, yet incumbent politicians are getting credit or blame for the game's outcome in the voting booth. It's a sign of just how fickle we are and how much we can be a captive to our own moods. It's a little scary to think that popular culture, including sports, ""medicates"" us for when we face real world decisions. Furthermore, if a sports score can matter this much, we should wonder whether voters are processing the more traditional forms of political information--such as data on economic performance--in a rational manner either. So let's consider an extreme scenario. Right now President Obama seems to have a slight edge over Gov. Mitt Romney, but most observers expect this election to be close. For Republicans, the key to victory could come down to how they perform in three swing states: Florida, Ohio, and Virginia. On Oct. 27th, a little more than a week before the election, the Ohio State Buckeyes have a big football game against Penn State. The University of Florida Gators have a huge match up against the University of Georgia Bulldogs. If the election remains razor close, these games in these two key battleground states could affect who sits in the White House for the next four years. Can you imagine Ohio State head coach Urban Meyer getting a late night call from the Obama campaign suggesting a particular blitz package? Or maybe Romney has some advice for how the Gators can bottle up Georgia's running game. The decision of whether to punt or go for it on that crucial fourth down could affect the job prospects of more than just the football team's coaching staff. The success of your local team is the electoral cousin of beer goggles: It can cloud your judgment and make you hate yourself in the morning. And that, as they say, just ain't right."

Mitt Romney squared off in their third debate Monday night, and both camps are claiming they won the Battle of Boca. Obama's campaign says the president won the debate; team Romney claims it's winning the election. So today's Slate/SurveyMonkey snap poll has a double purpose: to take the measure of each candidate's performance in the final debate and to ponder, anxiously, its significance in the grand scheme of things. As usual, we posted our questions immediately after the debate and left them up until 9 a.m. ET Tuesday. (Information on respondents is available here. More information about SurveyMonkey Audience is here.) First, a simple question: Who won the debate? Our results reflect a pretty clear victory for Barack Obama, who grabbed 55.4 percent of the vote to Mitt Romney's 24.1 percent. more than percent declared the dust-up a tie and just less than 10 percent were (our least favorite word) undecided. The president was in combative ""Long Island"" rather than faltering ""Denver"" mode last night, spicing his remarks with a sarcasm that was either gratifying or unseemly, depending on your political leaning. Many welcomed the attacks. The largest group of survey takers, 38.3 percent, described Obama as ""very effective,"" while 28 percent deemed him ""somewhat effective,"" and 18.3 percent pronounced him ""extremely effective."" A combined 15.3 percent shaded more negative, ranking the president either ""slightly"" or ""not at all"" effective. A more restrained Romney evoked comparably restrained responses. Just over 24 percent of survey takers called him ""somewhat effective,"" followed by 22.9 percent who found him ""slightly effective."" An equal amount of people--20.8 percent--characterized the former governor as ""very effective"" and ""not at all effective."" Only 11.3 percent considered Romney's mild-mannered performance ""extremely effective."" Despite his lower scores, Romney did not appear to surprise viewers. When we asked whether he acquitted himself better, worse, or the same as they predicted, a majority--50.4 percent--answered simply that he met their expectations. Obama's results were much rosier. Though the largest plurality, 38.5 percent were not particularly bowled over by Obama's performance, a combined 50.9 percent reported he exceeded their prognostications. But how did each candidate's performance play among the Americans who really count: undecided voters? Not surprisingly, this not-entirely-mythical population withheld its verdict as to who won the final debate. A strong majority, 65.5 percent, said they didn't know whether Romney or Obama had prevailed. Meanwhile, 14.5 percent opted for the president and a virtually indistinguishable 12.7 percent chose his opponent. Thanks for the additional clarity, guys. Yet the Boca showdown may have swayed more undecided Americans than any of the previous presidential bouts. In terms of getting bodies to the polling booth, Obama has the slightest lead over Romney: Nearly 11 percent of unspoken-for voters report that the third debate persuaded them to cast a ballot for the incumbent. Just more than 9 percent say the same for the governor. Our last question attempted to look back on the debates as a whole and to assess their impact on each candidate's campaign. ""Who do you think won the debates overall?"" we asked. Barack Obama pulled into the lead with 48.1 percent of the vote, Romney trailed with 34.1 percent, and a remaining 17.8 percent either couldn't make up their minds or called the whole affair a draw. But again, filtering for undecided viewers all but erased this Democratic advantage. A clear majority of 54.5 percent admitted that they hadn't chosen a victor from the three debates. And near-equal numbers of those who did name a particular candidate opted for Romney (18.2 percent) and Obama (20 percent). Ending our Slate/SurveyMonkey write-ups with murmuring about how we're not really sure what's going to happen in November is a cliche by now. But, for the record, we're not sure what's going to happen in November."	Obama Won the Debate. Does Anybody Care?

29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/third_presidential_debate_the_foreign_policy_argument_between_barack_obama.html	"BOCA RATON, Fla.--Halfway through the final presidential debate, after Bob Schieffer asked about negotiations with Iran, Mitt Romney asked the audience to remember something that never happened. ""The president in his campaign four years ago said he would meet with all the world's worst actors in his first year,"" said Romney. ""He'd sit down with Chavez and Kim Jong-il, with Castro and President Ahmadinejad of Iran. And I think they looked and thought, well, that's an unusual honor to receive from the president of the United States. And then the president began what I have called an apology tour."" Yes, when he was a candidate for the presidency and a suitor for anti-war voters, Barack Obama had pledged to meet a mug's gallery of dictators ""without preconditions."" During the campaign, it became a sort of accidental foreign policy. Then Obama became president, and--apart from one awkward photobomb from Chavez at a meeting of Latin American nations--the meetings never happened. Neither did the ""apology tour,"" really. It was as if Romney had written down some zingers in 2009 and accidentally brought the wrong notes to the table. Most of the debate felt that way. On the most ringing foreign-policy questions, on Afghanistan and Iran, Romney blurred the differences between Obama and himself. The ""crippling sanctions"" on Iran were ""absolutely the right thing to do,"" and ""something I called for five years ago, when I was in Israel, speaking at the Herzliya Conference."" Troops would come home from Afghanistan on basically the same timetable that Obama had drawn, because ""the commanders and the generals there are on track to do so."" Which is what Obama always says. He pointed this out, with relish. ""There have been times,"" he said, ""Governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that you'd do the same things we did, but you'd say them louder and somehow that would make a difference."" It rang true. When Romney wasn't nudging the debate back to domestic policy (Obama usually went along), he was either congratulating him on tactics or demanding a tougher strategy. The ""apology tour,"" as Romney finally defined it, meant that Obama ""went to the Middle East and you flew to Egypt and to Saudi Arabia and to Turkey and Iraq."" Again, this happened years ago. In the spin room after the debate, as he successfully dodged Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, Romney strategist Eric Fehrnstrom confirmed that Romney wanted to retell voters about ""candidate Obama in 2008"" and ""the Obama we saw in the first 18 months of his administration."" Obama's response to this was to look even further into the past. He emptied out his briefing books, asking Romney to explain why he'd switched positions when, as a candidate, he needed to be a critic of the administration. What had proved Obama right? The killing of American enemies who'd been threats for a decade or more. He mentioned Osama Bin Laden six times, and mentioned Muammar Qaddafi twice, shutting down the discussion of Libya by pointing out that its old rulers killed more Americans than had died in Benghazi. Republicans were unimpressed. ""He was using a dramatic name to play on an old fear,"" shrugged Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House's Homeland Security Committee, who's been calling for the Obama administration to fire U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice over her Benghazi statements. ""The fact is, Qaddafi was nullified by Bush. He was not a threat."" While every post-debate poll called it for Obama, this interplay--the focus on the recent past--was on balance good for the challenger. The CNN poll that gave Obama a 48-40 overall win also asked independents whether they could see Romney as commander-in-chief. By a 62-36 margin, they said yes. Asked that question about Obama, they gave the same margin. If that number holds, it'll be because Romney managed to make the ""say it louder"" argument without getting caught. His description of an anti-terror strategy that didn't involve apologies made almost no sense. He would rely on the advice of ""Arab scholars,"" and ""interrupt"" the ""bad guys,"" but not go to war. ""We don't want another Iraq,"" he said. ""We don't want another Afghanistan. That's not the right course for us."" That made Romney sound like he was cold on more military commitments, even as he inflated the military budget. Take this further into the present, and you can attach real missions to it. I asked Sen. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican who's become a sort of leader of the hawks, exactly how a Romney presidency might tackle its first problems, starting with Libya. ""The first thing I'd recommend that a President Romney do is go into Libya and help train a national army to de-fang the militias,"" he said. There might be different responses in different nations. ""In northern Mali, it might be special forces operations."" Graham framed all of this in a criticism of the last administration, the Bush team. ""I remember being told that we didn't need 160,000 troops. I remember being told it would cost $50 billion."" As we talked, some veterans of the Bush team, like Romney's senior foreign-policy adviser Dan Senor, walked around spinning for Romney. Why was he confident that these people would get it right--not just perfect hindsight, getting it right on the next crises--if they took power again? ""They eventually readjusted their strategy,"" said Graham. ""I think they have the lessons of Bush seared into their brains. If I were Romney, I'd tell the American people I won't be a cowboy, and I won't be an apologist. I'm gonna be smart."""	Why Romney's Foreign Policy Debate Felt So 2008
