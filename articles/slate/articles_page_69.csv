Bill Posey, he was talking about Barack Obama's birth certificate. It was March 2009. Posey had been in office for two months, and he was the first to propose a bill requiring presidential nominees to hand over ""documentation as may be necessary to establish that the candidate meets the qualifications for eligibility."" He was Internet-famous overnight. Stephen Colbert was asking him to prove that he, Posey, wasn't part alligator. ""There is no reason to say that I'm the illegitimate grandson of an alligator,"" said the congressman."	The Successful Republican Effort to Cut Government Funding for Social-Science Research

The encampment was razed 14 months ago; the only evidence that dozens of humans used to sleep, book-share, and ""mic check"" there is the sad, randomly patchy state of the grass. On Thursday, the grass was trampled one more time, for a cause. Occupy the NRA was starting its marquee media event in the park. The collective handed out new Shepard Fairey-designed posters, which featured an ironic NRA logo of a bird with a target on its chest and a slogan slightly less catchy than HOPE: AMERICA, the Land Where God Saves & Satan Invests in Assault Weapons and High Capacity Magazines A crowd of 60 or so activists gathered in front of a stage, flanked by novelty-sized checks that thanked lobbying groups ""for shooting down common-sense gun laws."" Two dozen reporters flitted around, making the most of a rally that had been scheduled to happen nine days earlier, before the Boston Marathon bombing Occupied the news cycle. It was up to ""activist and teacher"" Justin Wedes to explain the connection between the movement, the march, and the restless anger over gun control's April defeat. ""I'm not speaking for Occupy Wall Street,"" he said. ""Nobody speaks for Occupy Wall Street. I'm a teacher, and a concerned citizen. I'm seeing the violence happening across this country. I'm seeing young kids die. I'm seeing mothers crying. It's unacceptable, and to Occupy Wall Street, and to every Occupier, it should be unacceptable because these deaths are profitable. It's profitable to the groups whose names you see on these checks here."" So he joined their march, walked as close as possible to the lobbyists' offices, and shamed those names. ""I consider this a form of economic vigilante justice,"" he said. The recent gun control debate, which lasted roughly from the week of the Newtown shooting to last week, saw an oddly controlled spasm of political activism. The Obama administration and pro-gun bill Democrats basically got to pick their advocates--victims' families, Gabrielle Giffords, Michael Bloomberg, Michael Bloomberg's bottomless checking account. The angry people let into the Senate gallery last week were siblings and mothers of shooting spree victims, not Occupiers. These were the people Joe Biden met with, just today, not far from the Occupy gathering. But that didn't work. The next gun control campaign is more anarchic. Democrats pulled their Senate reform package because doing so meant--theoretically!--tweaking it and winning a vote later in the year. But they haven't updated their applause lines. Democrats still describe ""background checks,"" however constructed, as something supported by ""90 percent of Americans."" That's after the White House's pollster Joel Benenson told them that the support was soft, and told them why. ""The American people already think that these gun safety proposals are in place,"" said Joe Biden last month. After the other pollsters moved on, Princeton Survey Research made the calls and found support for any kind of gun bill slipping to a 49-45 yes-no margin. Any gun control advocate who was honest with himself had to expect that. The Newtown shooting was in December; people have short memories, even for most sorts of national traumas. Some Democrats whisper that another shooting, another media frenzy, could restart the clock. In the meantime, they're aimless. On Wednesday, Bloomberg's Mayors Against Illegal Guns belatedly released a report fretting about the ""terror gap,"" the fact that people on terror watchlists can buy guns. But there's no evidence that the Tsarnaev brothers were on such a list. In 2007, Wayne LaPierre smacked down one legislative version of a fix by warning that it would bestow upon ""a future attorney general of the United States--think, a Hillary Clinton administration--power to declare anyone to be a 'prohibited person' on a par with a convicted felon or fugitive from justice, all done in total secrecy."" The goal of the December-through-April gun fight was simply to win, on anything. ""There's a cultural problem you need to deal with first,"" said one of the Thursday organizers, Steve Clermont, as leaders told the marchers with the novelty checks to head to the front. ""Once you pass a bill, then people who are up for re-election in 2014 win anyway, the attitude changes."" The grassroots and the White House agree on that, completely. The entire Thursday march was structured to accuse lobbyists of literally profiting from murder--no other motivation was possible. But where's the proof that a top-down strategy, a Senate win on something called ""the gun control compromise,"" would change this? The month of Obama-Biden gun control speeches during the pre-Manchin-Toomey lull got incredibly specific about the NRA, with the president mocking anyone who would worry about losing an A-plus rating from the group. Shaming rural state politicians who crib NRA rhetoric doesn't move them. It freezes them in place. ""I'm so frustrated by the tenor of this discussion that this will solve a problem that it won't solve,"" North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp told the Williston (N.D.) Herald this month, before voting against the Toomey-Manchin gun compromise. ""People who have always been opposed to guns are making this about guns, when we should be making it about mental health."" I walked in the mix with the Occupy NRA crowd as they crowded the first of the targeted lobby shops. They didn't get close; police, who'd kindly let the marchers walk freely on D.C.'s main streets, formed a line in front of the building, several floors below the target's office. (Also, no one leading the march remembered who the target was--Crossroads Strategies, maybe.) ""We need to get clever, like the NRA,"" said Leah Gunn Barrett.* She was the executive director of New Yorkers Against Gun Violence, one of the speakers at the rally, right after a mother whose daughter had been shot in D.C. ""They've been working away at passing concealed carry laws in the states for years. That's how you win, not with something at the federal level. We have to change norms, and that starts at the local level."" Just then the protest actually got underway, and drowned out our conversation. Down with lobbyists! Down with the NRA!

2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/04/house_and_senate_budget_conference_committee_republicans_and_democrats_can.html	"Congress is a mysterious place. Today, for example, the House took up measure H.R. 1071, which will specify the size of the planchets on commemorative coins issued by the Baseball Hall of Fame. Congress has the power to coin money, and this legislation amends the National Baseball Hall of Fame Commemorative Coin Act to specify the diameter of the blanks from which gold and silver coins will be made. This is just one of the arcane events that happen every day as a part of the congressional pageant. There are many others. Most can be safely ignored. Some of the esoteric inner workings of Congress are important, though, because the rules of the game can determine the outcome. The overuse of the filibuster has fundamentally changed the nature of the Senate, for example. Almost nothing can pass the Senate without 60 votes, as we just witnessed with gun control. Right now there is a procedural fight underway about how the House and Senate should proceed with the budget. How it resolves itself will offer some clues about whether we're headed for another summer of ad hoc budget madness or whether there is hope for a grand bargain. The debate is about setting up a budget conference, the process by which representatives from each body are to reconcile the House and Senate budgets. That we've even gotten to this point is a victory of sorts. Senate Democrats didn't offer a budget for four years, so there hasn't been anything to reconcile in a long time. In the last two years, the government has budgeted by crisis. Using the flawed but irresistible analogy of the family budget, Congress has been deciding how much of which bills to pay off while the repo man and bill collector are at the front door. Disorder in the process created an escalating series of confrontations over funding government operations and avoiding breaking through the debt ceiling. The final insult was sequestration--across-the-board budget cuts designed never to go into effect--that are now firmly in effect. With the new Congress came the promise from both sides that they would return to the orderly way of doing things. We were going to spread out the bills on the kitchen table at the start of the month and be sensible. Returning to ""regular order"" wouldn't make the budget issues any easier to solve, but it did offer the possibility of draining some of the suspicion from both sides. After the supercommittee and the various gangs of senators failed to find any budget solutions, maybe the people who are actually supposed to work out the issues should have a crack at it. ""We've been in a stalemate for four years,"" House Budget chairman Paul Ryan told the National Review. ""I'm very critical of the Senate's budget, but at least they're doing one. Let's use this process to go through regular order to get an agreement."" Jeff Sessions, the ranking Republican member on the Senate budget committee, was also a fan of regular order. ""Secret deals have not worked and are an affront to popular democracy,"" he argued in January. ""The right process is the regular order."" Steve Bell, a longtime Senate budget veteran now with the Bipartisan Policy Center, thought it was a good sign after years of budget fishtailing. ""When you're a budget person, you're never hopeful, but the fact is that I had a glimmer of what I think was optimism,"" he says. ""I am so unfamiliar with it, it may have been a bad stomach, but it was a glimmer of hope."" The hope was based on the idea that regular order meant that both the House and Senate would follow the Budget Act. Under that act, any budget that goes through regular order is brought up under the rules of reconciliation, which means it would only need a simple majority to pass the Senate. For a grand bargain that would include tax reform and entitlement reform, the regular threshold would be very helpful. As we saw recently with legislation on background checks for gun purchases, it's hard to get 60 votes for ideas that have even 90 percent public approval. ""The appointment of conferees by both sides is the hinge that will bring us the chance for tax reform and entitlement reform,"" says Bell, ""Without that, it wouldn't go forward."" The House and Senate have each passed budgets, and now under regular order we are at the point where the leaders of each body are supposed to appoint members to a conference committee to hash out the differences. That's where things have broken down. Republicans don't want to name the conference members. On Tuesday, Sen. Harry Reid tried to force the issue, but he was blocked by Republicans. Democrats say they want to get going because the faster a budget agreement can be reached, the faster the mindless sequestration cuts can be replaced with a budget that at least prioritizes things. They are also eager to get the long, drawn-out public process of reconciling the House and Senate budget bills started because they think that spectacle will embarrass Republicans. GOP members would be forced to openly defend their position that they will not raise revenues from taxes under any circumstances. Meanwhile, every day that Republicans don't meet the deadline for appointing members to the conference committee, Democrats can hammer them for not following the regular order that they so long demanded from Democrats. Republican leaders say they want an agreement on an initial starting point for negotiations before they continue so that when these conference committee members are named, they have a common framework to start from. That has been done before, and it makes sense. There is a lot to be worked out to reconcile these two visions. The House Republican budget is from Mars--trillions more in spending cuts than Democrats propose--and the Democratic Senate budget is from Venus, with a trillion in tax hikes Republicans oppose. ""Even if they did name conferees, I just don't see evidence of agreement between the two,"" says Barry Anderson, formerly of the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office. House Speaker John Boehner also has another motive for delay. Under the rules, 20 days after the conference committee convenes, Democrats would gain the power to force votes. These votes would likely be designed to embarrass Republicans politically. Disputes about regular order are, in a sense, a part of regular order. They are part of legislative gamesmanship. But as President Obama tries to work a side deal with Republican senators over a grand bargain, this debate reminds us how mired things still are in Congress. One of the arguments for doing things according to the rule book was that it would help the economy. The markets and CEOs making bets on the future would see that Washington lawmakers had snapped themselves out of the frenzied rounds of bicker and spit. Consumers, whose confidence dropped as a result of last year's fiscal cliff negotiations, would also regain their spirits. This summer lawmakers will face another deadline over the fiscal cliff. The hope has been that rational heads, working under regular order, would come up with an agreement that would help everyone avoid another frantic moment at the brink. If this dispute over naming budget conferees is a harbinger of things to come, we're headed back to regular disorder."	Why Congress Can't Agree on Its Own Rules for Disagreeing About the Budget

One week ago, Putin was a vaguely menacing autocrat. Today, he's a far-sighted ally who could have told us that the Tsarnaev brothers, two Muslims with roots in Chechnya, would be trouble. Jacob Heilbrunn has asked whether the bombings in Boston meant ""vindication"" for Putin. My colleague Fred Kaplan reported that ""Russian intelligence services are all over Chechen radicals,"" and speculated that ""Boston may serve as an opportunity for these two powers to start over."" Our sudden outbreak of Russophilia can be traced to one simple fact about the Boston investigation. In 2011, ""a foreign government asked the FBI for information about Tamerlan Tsarnaev,"" who'd arrived in the United States nearly 10 years earlier. (His brother arrived a little later.) The bureau complied. Finding nothing and later flummoxed by an airline's clerical error, the United States allowed Tsarnaev to take a lengthy trip to Russia. On Monday, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul wrote a letter to Senate leaders asking why ""the current [immigration] system allows two individuals to immigrate to the United States from the Chechen Republic in Russia, an area known as a hotbed of Islamic extremism, who then committed acts of terrorism?"" Paul mangled some minor details of the story. The Tsarnaevs probably arrived in the United States from Kyrgyzstan, and their European relatives now live in the Russian republic of Dagestan. But that's beside the point. Asking whether Putin and Russia were right about Chechnya, and about terrorism--that hasn't been done for years. When it was done, it was mostly a matter of realpolitik. In 1991, Chechnya proclaimed independence from the Russian Federation. In December 1994, Russian forces attacked the breakaway republic and spent years pacifying it. The United States didn't really do anything about this. At an April 1996 press conference, flanked by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Clinton even gave the Russians a somewhat dark atta-boy. ""We once had a civil war in our country,"" said Clinton, ""in which we lost, on a per capita basis, far more people than we lost in any of the wars of the 20th century, over the proposition that Abraham Lincoln gave his life for, that no state had a right to withdrawal from our union."" Three months later, Yeltsin was safely re-elected; one month after that, the first Chechen War came to an end. And three years later, the second Chechen War began. This one raised hackles in the States. Observers in Russia, like Anne Applebaum, came back with ominous stories of the (literally) ailing Yeltsin government painting all Chechens as ""blacks"" and ""terrorists."" In 1999, a team of foreign policy hands--some of whom didn't yet mind being called ""neoconservatives""--formed the American Committee for Peace in Chechnya. Headquartered at the democracy-promotion think tank Freedom House, it held meetings and placed columns, a steady awareness-raising campaign to describe just how brutal the Russians were being. These skeptics found their moment after 9/11. Yeltsin had resigned, leaving Putin with the presidency and a war that he carried out with broad popular support. Putin presented himself as a natural ally who understood exactly what Americans were going through. ""Putin does not come to us with clean hands in dealing with Muslims,"" wrote Stephen Schwartz in a post-9/11 issue of the Weekly Standard. ""In our new effort to gain Muslim allies and supporters Americans can only harm our cause by appearing to sign off on the continued mistreatment of a small, isolated people."" Gaining Muslim allies--easy to forget, but that was what neoconservatives aspired to after 9/11. Agitating for the overthrow of Saddam Hussein and announcing solidarity with non-radicalized Chechens were simultaneous causes. The American Committee had its own specific successes, like an August 2002 peace summit (on the very neutral turf of Lichtenstein). Occasionally these whack-a-mole D.C. ""letterhead"" groups, the ones that start up to agitate for a cause from a think tank's spare rooms, score some wins. (Some of the people listed as committee members, like Eliot Cohen, say they probably just signed a letter from the group.) The American Committee's long-term win was preventing Putin from credibly describing everything he did as just another piece of the ""global war on terror."" That win didn't survive long past the Bush years. Conservatives don't trust the Obama administration to define or name Islamic terrorism. ""Tamerlan Tsarnaev is the fifth person since 9/11 who has participated in terror attacks after questioning by the FBI,"" wrote Bush's last attorney general, Michael Mukasey, in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on Sunday. One country's serious about ""radical Islam""; one isn't, and you hardly need to point out which. Chechens are understandably spooked. In an interview with Michael Moynihan, Chechen prime-minister-in-exile Akhmed Zakayev called the Boston bombings a ""gift"" to the Russians. ""Three years ago,"" he pointed out, ""Putin said that Western nations granting political asylum to Chechens will have problems with these Chechens."" And he was being proven right, wasn't he? Conservatives are still figuring that out. In a weekend podcast, Boston conservative talk-radio host Michael Graham prodded Bill Kristol about what the Russians might have to teach America. ""These are the Russians,"" said Graham. ""They're used to dealing with rough characters."" Kristol urged some caution. ""There's a sense--I don't necessarily disagree with this--you have to discount [that],"" he said. ""Maybe they're trying to get us to be suspicious of every Chechen who came to the U.S., especially of everyone who came as a political refugee."" But Kristol had to admit (based on some secret sourcing) that when it came to Tsarnaev the ""Russians didn't just throw out this name. They had a pretty detailed dossier of his contacts."" If conservatives want the Tsarnaevs to be seen as ""enemy combatants,"" they're combatants in a war Americans thought they'd rejected years ago."	How American Neocons Were for Chechens Before They Were Against Them
4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/04/tsarnaevs_and_boston_bombings_like_most_terrorists_they_were_hapless_and.html	"Between Sept. 12, 2001, and last Monday, some 52 cases came to light in which the United States itself has been, or apparently has been, targeted for terrorism by Islamist extremists, whether based in the United States or abroad. By far the most striking difference between the Boston Marathon killings and these earlier cases is that, for the first time, terrorists actually were able to assemble and detonate bombs. Many previous plotters harbored visions of carrying out bombings, and in 10 of the cases, they were supplied with fantasy-fulfilling, if bogus, bombs by obliging FBI informants. But until Boston, no would-be terrorists had been able to make and set one off on their own. And, except for four bombs detonated on the London transport system in 2005, nor has any terrorist in the United Kingdom. This is surprising in part because in the 1970s there were hundreds of terrorist incidents on U.S. soil, most of them bombings, killing 72 people. In many other respects, however, the Boston Marathon bombing is quite similar to the other 52 cases. For example, the Boston perpetrators were clearly not suicidal, which is the standard in American cases. In only six of the earlier plots were the perpetrators clearly willing to die in their terrorist effort. And except for their ability to fabricate and detonate bombs, the Boston terrorists do not seem to have been any more competent than most of their predecessors. The Department of Homeland Security, in assessing what it ominously calls ""the nature of the terrorist adversary,"" is fond of stressing their determination, persistence, relentlessness, patience, and flexibility. This may apply to some terrorists somewhere, including at least a few of those involved in the Sept. 11 attacks. But it scarcely describes the vast majority of those individuals picked up on terrorism charges in the United States since those attacks. In describing the ""adversary,"" the case studies far more commonly use words like incompetent, ineffective, unintelligent, idiotic, ignorant, inadequate, unorganized, misguided, muddled, amateurish, dopey, unrealistic, moronic, irrational, foolish, and gullible. Many of the cases suggest that there is little exaggeration in the 2010 film, Four Lions, the impressive dark comedy about a band of hapless home-grown British terrorists. Amazingly, the Boston perpetrators apparently thought they could somehow get away with their deed even though they chose to set their bombs off at the most-photographed spot on the planet at the time. Moreover, although they were not prepared to die with their bombs, they do not seem to have had anything that could be considered a coherent plan of escape. This rather bizarre inability to think about the aftermath of the planned deed is quite typical in the case studies. (Also commonly found: an inability to explain how killing a few random people would advance their cause.) The Boston perpetrators seem never to have ventured much more than a few miles from the bombing location, and they appear to have had no reliable means of transport and no money. Then, when the police published their photographs, they mindlessly blew whatever cover they had by killing a campus cop, hijacking a car, stealing money, trying to run a police blockade, and engaging in a brief Hollywood-style car chase and shootout. Surveillance imagery played an important role in identifying the terrorists (as it did in terrorist events in London in 2005), but the key breakthrough appears to have come when the culprits decided to leave their lair, after which the police applied standard killer-on-the-loose methodology. And while the scope of the tragedy in Boston should not be minimized, it should also be noted that, if the terrorists' aim was to kill a large number of people, their bombs failed miserably. As recent cases in Colorado and Connecticut sadly demonstrate, far more fatalities have been inflicted by gunmen. Boston appears to be a lone-wolf attack--albeit one with two wolves--in the sense that no one besides the bombers seems to have been aware of it. Attacks in which only the perpetrator knows about the plans are obviously more difficult to avert than ones involving a great number of talkative people. (In some cases, would-be terrorists have advertised for support or collaborators on Facebook and in Internet chat rooms.) Before Boston, some 16 people had been killed by Islamist terrorists in the United States in the years since 2001 (13 of them at Ft. Hood), and all of these were murdered by people who were essentially acting alone. Concern about ""lone wolf"" attacks has grown in recent years, and a 2011 DHS assessment concluded that ""lone offenders currently present the greatest threat."" This is a reasonable observation, but those concerned should keep in mind that, as Max Abrahms has noted, while lone wolves may be difficult to police, they have carried out only two of the 1,900 most deadly terrorist attacks over the last four decades. They may be harder to stop, but they are also less lethal. (It should also be kept in mind that an American's chance of being killed by any kind of terrorist, even with 9/11 included in the count, remains about one in 3 million or 4 million per year.) It is still unclear what motivated the Boston bombers. We are hearing a lot about ""radicalization,"" a concept that is not only vague but also questionably suggests, as Arun Kundnani has pointed out, that violence is inherent or implied in Muslims who become deeply religious. Evidence from the 52 cases strongly indicates that assuming an ideological motivation for terrorism is not useful. In almost all the cases, the overwhelming driving force was not something that could be called ideology, but rather a simmering, and more commonly boiling, outrage at U.S. foreign policy--the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, in particular, and the country's support for Israel in the Palestinian conflict. Religion was a part of the consideration for most, but not because they wished to spread Sharia law or to establish caliphates (few of the culprits would be able to spell either word). Rather they wanted to protect their co-religionists against what was commonly seen to be a concentrated war upon them in the Middle East by the U.S. government. Rather remarkably, none of the 52 cases after 9/11 has inspired much in the way of continued interest from the public and the media. After some days of coverage--or weeks in a very few instances--they largely faded from attention. This is impressive because some were actually rather threatening, and many were populated by colorful characters and involve interesting law-and-order issues. Books have been written about only two of the cases, and neither appears to have sold very well. Whether the Boston Marathon case will prove to be an exception--perhaps because of its venue and the manhunt--is yet to be seen, of course. Boston might trigger some panicky and costly security measures, just as past terrorist efforts have inspired wars on shoes, liquids, and underwear at airports. In this case, the surveillance camera market is likely to experience a windfall, and we can expect a fair amount of heightened security at sporting events and a whole lot of hand-wringing about the immigration system. But, given budget difficulties, there is a distinct prospect that the new measures will be limited."	Why Didn't the Tsarnaev Brothers Carry Out Suicide Bombings?
5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/04/bill_mckibben_s_fight_against_keystone_xl_the_movement_against_the_pipeline.html	"It is perhaps fitting that Bill McKibben was among the first people arrested protesting climate change. After all, he had written The End of Nature, the first widely read book on the subject in 1989. At the time, though, he naively thought, as he often puts it now, that people would ""read my book, then change."" But after 10 years of complete governmental inaction, McKibben was ready to try a different tack. And so, on April 21, 2000--a day before Earth Day--he joined a small group of campaign-finance activists in the Capitol Rotunda, where they were arrested with a banner that read, ""Stop campaign contributions from global warmers."" ""That didn't accomplish much,"" he said, thinking back on it now. ""It was maybe premature."" McKibben should know. He has spent the better part of the next decade building a climate movement that in February showed up 50,000 strong on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Days earlier he had been arrested again, his third and most recent such offense--but this time he was joined by representatives of the nation's largest environmental groups. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of the Natural Resources Defense Council was there, as were the heads of Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. But of particular significance was the presence of Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune--who broke with the organization's 120-year ban on civil disobedience by cuffing himself to the White House gate. The occasion was not to stop something as extensive as campaign contributions but rather a single pipeline--the Keystone XL--which, if granted a special presidential permit, would carry dirty oil from Canada's tar sands region in Northern Alberta to the Texas Gulf Coast. McKibben and a few organizers, who now work for his climate group 350.org, had made this pipeline a national issue in August 2011 when they held two weeks of sit-ins in front of the White House. This protest, which led to 1,253 arrests, was the largest organized act of civil disobedience in the United States in decades. [Full disclosure: I was one of those arrested.] Still, many consider the construction of the Keystone pipeline inevitable--after all, even 54 percent of Democrats support it. It's for this reason that critics such as New York Times columnist Joe Nocera have called the protests ""boneheaded."" They believe environmental action could be better spent on some other goal, like perhaps encouraging people to reduce their carbon footprint. But these critics are missing something vital about the anti-Keystone movement: It was never about just a pipeline. McKibben and a handful of others had another, less talked about goal--to remake the environmental movement into something far more active, creative, and formidable for years to come. The gap that once existed between mainstream environmental groups and grass-roots activists has now largely dissolved, resulting in widespread action that has not been seen in the United States for decades--perhaps even since the first Earth Day in April 1970. On that day, mainstream environmental groups with roots going back to the conservation movement of the early 20th century united with grass-roots activists for a day of teach-ins, influenced by the burgeoning student anti-war movement. Amid the thousands of demonstrations that took place across the nation, there was at least one major act of civil disobedience, in which 15 people were arrested for holding a mock funeral inside Boston's Logan Airport. Interestingly enough, it was a sort of proto-climate protest against a supersonic plane and its accompanying release of water vapor--a major greenhouse gas. After that Earth Day, however, the two strands of environmentalism largely went their separate ways, with mainstream groups preferring a more professional approach that took them to courtrooms, shareholder meetings, and the halls of Congress rather than street demonstrations. And for a time, that approach succeeded wildly, earning some of the most important and long-standing environmental gains in this country's history. But according to a 2012 report by the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, such efforts have yielded no ""significant policy changes at the federal level in the United States since the 1980s."" For perhaps no issue is that fact more clear than with climate change. ""We knew enough way back then to act,"" says James Gustave Speth, who has advised two presidents on the environment and co-founded the Natural Resources Defense Council in 1970. ""When I was chair of President Carter's Council on Environmental Policy, we issued several reports calling for climate action. So much for my effectiveness."" Speth has since turned to activism and was among the first people arrested during the two weeks of sit-ins outside the White House. And he wasn't the only former bureaucrat turned activist. NASA scientist James Hansen, who was the first to testify before Congress about the urgency of climate change in 1989, was also among those arrested at the White House, both in August 2011 and last February. In fact, his description of what would happen if Canada's vast tar sands oil reserves were further developed--in short, ""game over for the climate""--served as inspiration for the White House sit-ins. Recently, he has decided to step down from his post as the director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies and pursue activism full-time. ""Our scientists sounded an early warning, and explained it to the world,"" McKibben said. ""They were ignored because of the power of the fossil fuel industry. So, we've had to add moral suasion to reason."" That, of course, wouldn't have amounted to much more than his first attempt at civil disobedience in the Capitol Rotunda, had he not set about building a broad base of supporters over the last five years with 350.org. Known for its massive days of global action, the group drew people in with its creative approach to activism--from staging gigantic aerial art pieces that could be seen from space to holding work parties, where actual climate solutions such as solar panels and community gardens were implemented on the local level. The real push toward civil disobedience, however, came from a University of Utah student named Tim DeChristopher, who disrupted a federal oil and gas auction in December 2008 by posing as a bidder. It wasn't his plan. He actually didn't have one. All he knew was that the protest outside the auction was going nowhere. So he walked in, thinking maybe he'd make a speech. But auctioneers handed him a paddle instead, which he used to buy 22,500 acres--worth nearly $1.8 million--before federal agents caught on to the ruse. DeChristopher quickly became a cult icon for a growing climate movement, particularly as his unrepentant nature forced a criminal case that landed him in jail for two years. Coincidentally, his first full day out of custody will be this Earth Day. ""Tim did something that really resonated with a lot of the general public, where they felt emboldened with power, and started to reassess their own capacity for what they can do to make this world a better place,"" said Matt Leonard, the principle organizer of the White House sit-ins. ""We've definitely seen a ton of stories from people who were inspired by Tim and said that was the tipping point for them."" Knowing, however, that most people were not prepared to risk receiving long jail sentences, McKibben and his team of young organizers crafted an action that was both simple and symbolic. They decided on holding sit-ins because, as Leonard explained, ""It's a tactic that resonates with people's historical understanding of civil disobedience--for instance the lunch counter sit-ins of the civil rights movement."" Also, it is something that anyone can do and the point, after all, was to turn passive allies into active members of a movement. Tar Sands Action, as the campaign was known, positioned itself as a bridge between the grass roots and the mainstream. In effect, it was radicalizing the latter by using a very basic and low-risk tactic of the former. At the same time, it was making use of the mainstream groups' strengths, such as generating publicity, writing reports, and coordinating legal action. Getting these groups to work together on the same project was a big accomplishment not only because some of them work in different areas but also because, as Leonard explained, ""there's actually some real political disagreements."" Yet, as much as this newfound cooperation was the result of the organizers playing the middleman, it was also a direct result of what organizer Linda Capato called ""the history of the last couple years in the environmental movement."" With nothing happening on the political front, everyone working on the climate issue realized that, as Capato explained, ""We need to start showing up in mass numbers. The reason the president is able to ignore the environmental movement is because he doesn't think the environment is an important issue to Americans."" Tar Sands Action challenged that perception by creating the largest civil disobedience action in decades, followed several months later in November 2011 by 12,000 people encircling the White House.The president's reluctance to make a final determination reflects this newfound environmental activism. But what may end up being more important, in terms of the bigger fight to stop climate change--is what comes next. ""We sort of opened up this realm of possibilities,"" said Rae Breaux, another Tar Sands Action organizer. ""In terms of organizing civil disobedience campaigns, it's a thing that people consider an option now."" Many other climate-oriented campaigns saw an influx of participants last summer, as major actions were held against mountaintop removal coal mining in Appalachia, fracking in the Northeast, and coal exports in the Northwest. But the biggest campaign that emerged from this was Tar Sands Blockade, which united Occupy activists, rural East Texas landowners, and indigenous and minority communities in a struggle to physically block construction of the Keystone XL pipeline already under way. Since August, the group has coordinated 19 actions in more than a dozen counties in Oklahoma and Texas, leading to 68 arrests--including a 79-year-old grandmother who u-locked her neck to construction equipment. The campaign has also spurred nationwide protest. During one week in March there were 55 actions in 15 states, with hundreds risking arrest. ""It's not just about the anti-KXL message,"" said Kim Huynh, an organizer with Tar Sands Blockade, ""but also the anti-KXL messenger. We have sought to elevate the voices and perspectives of the individuals and communities most impacted by tar sands--communities being poisoned like the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation at the point of tar sands extraction and like the primarily Latino neighborhoods in Houston at the point of tar sands refining."" This kind of work has excited longtime environmentalists like James Gustave Speth, who says, ""I think we will soon see a real climate victims movement. That is very different from a movement based on intellectual understanding and forecasts."" No one knows how the Keystone pipeline decision will be decided, but even if it's a loss for the environmentalists, it's just one battle in a much bigger fight. And judging by a recent online ""Keystone XL Pledge of Resistance""--which gathered nearly 60,000 signatures for acts of peaceful civil disobedience ""should it be necessary""-- people are ready for that fight. ""The success of the campaign is not measured just on the pragmatic side of stopping the pipeline,"" Leonard said. ""As far as that goes, I think we made a noble effort. I'm not going to say we've lost, but I think it's certainly a deeper debate and question. In terms of being able to transform the movement in a really positive and productive way for any issue or campaign moving forward, we've had tremendous success there. To me, that's arguably the more important side of things."" For McKibben, the sight of nearly 50,000 people on the National Mall in February was more than he could have ever imagined on that day of his first arrest, when he and a few others were the only voices of resistance. Now, he sees an ""emerging fossil fuel resistance,"" adding, ""and it's nice to be a small part of it."""	Why the Anti-Keystone Movement Was Never Just About a Pipeline

Watching them scramble to come up with an easy political explanation for the events was like watching a 1950s switchboard operator. Too few guns? No, wait, soft on immigration. No, Islamic radicalism. These conclusions weren't being drawn based on facts, but rather existing arguments and political agendas into which the skinniest fact or rumor could be fit. Sen. Chuck Grassley suggested at a Senate hearing on immigration that the incident meant we needed a thorough investigation of the loopholes in the immigration system. What evidence was there that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev had exploited loopholes at the time of Grassley's claim? None. We need more restraint and less wild guessing. Free-flowing debate in the search for meaning is a part of these moments and a part of the human condition, but what I'm talking about is using tragedy for evidence shopping. That people reach immediately for their pet political theory at moments like this highlights what's wrong with a lot of political debate. But perhaps this moment also offers a useful sorting technique. If you can't shut up now, when either reason, decency, or good taste requires it, you disqualify yourself from the conversation in calmer times. If you're going to reason with someone over a complicated issue, you've got to have the expectation that they are going to leave a little window open to persuasion. There can't be much of a debate--or even conversation--if they are in such a state of siege that they instinctively dismiss everything you say or take every new fact and mindlessly mold it to their purpose. Through this narrow portal you might be able to squeeze your salient point and come to some understanding about a complicated issue. Political debate about facts is fine. When the White House puts out a picture of the president in the situation room, it's fine to point out that it's propaganda they never put out on Benghazi. But a person who uses tragedy as new evidence in an existing political fight is probably incapable of keeping this window open. They can't pause to honor the solemnity of a moment of tragedy or wait until the facts come in, which means that the facts never really mattered much to them at all. These partisans are ever on alert to advance their relentless claim--whatever it is. Michael Moore immediately fingered Tea Party types after the bombing. In the hours after attack, when authorities questioned a man of Saudi dissent (who was later released), Rep. Steve King tied it to the comprehensive immigration reform he opposes. Nate Bell, an Arkansas state lawmaker, tweeted, ""I wonder how many Boston liberals spent the night cowering in their homes wishing they had an AR-15 with a hi-capacity magazine? #2A"" There was lots of this from partisans on both sides on Twitter. In the wake of the Boston bombing, a lot of smart commentators suggested we follow the advice of the World War II British poster: Keep Calm and Carry On. Since we seem predisposed to misinterpret events upon first hearing, perhaps jumping to conclusions is the most natural way for people to ""carry on."" Maybe, but it is not an example of calmness; it's an example of panic--or even worse, shameless opportunism. When someone makes a tasteless joke in proximity to a tragedy, we say it's too soon. There should be a disqualifying equivalent for those who declare political conclusions too fast. In these fast-moving times when the only thing that is certain is that the first piece of news has repeatedly been wrong, perhaps those lawmakers and pundits who want to be part of the final conversation should (paraphrasing Mike Monteiro) follow the Quaker rule: Be meaningful or be quiet."	How Some Politicians and Pundits Are Using the Boston Bombing to Score Political Points
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/04/the_boston_marathon_bombing_how_will_the_tragedy_change_the_way_america.html	"We have the measure of the tragedy in Boston, the tally of dead and injured, those who have lost limbs, those who remain in critical condition, the incalculable grief and sorrow Americans share. But what will be the long-term consequences of this attack? Much will depend on who is found to be responsible, how soon, and whether further terrorist attacks occur before investigators can close the books on this one. Will intelligence agencies take the blame for failing to uncover a bomber in our midst? Will the bombing lead to the imposition of new security measures, not just at marathons or other major sporting events, but at all mass gatherings--more perimeters, more check points, more onerous searches? Will a frightened public embrace further curtailments of liberty in the name of security? Will the bloodshed in Boston, where 238 years ago citizen soldiers fired the first shots of a revolution, foster new attitudes about the role of today's citizens in their own defense? Will the Boston bombing be viewed as an intelligence failure? Intelligence has significantly improved since 9/11. At the international level, the United States has mounted a massive intelligence effort to attack al-Qaida's global terrorist enterprise with unprecedented cooperation from the world's intelligence services and law enforcement organizations. Domestically, the FBI has carried out a remarkable transformation of its institutional culture to become an effective domestic intelligence agency, assisted at the local level by the intelligence efforts of police departments. As a result, the FBI and local authorities have foiled most of the terrorist plots in the United States since 9/11. Domestic intelligence collection is always a delicate business in a democracy. Opponents have attacked these programs on the grounds that they discriminate against specific communities and threaten civil liberties. In the immediate shadow of 9/11, these complaints found little support, but as people have come to feel safer, critics of domestic intelligence gathering have launched new offensives. No one seriously believes that intelligence efforts can detect every terrorist plot. The majority of the terrorist plots uncovered since 9/11 have involved a single individual. Few of them had any prior connections with terrorism. Many plots were uncovered through sting operations, but this kind of detection is unlikely when individuals carry out plots without the help of others. We have no X-ray for a man's soul. Intelligence did not prevent the attack in Boston. This intelligence ""failure"" will be reviewed to see what was missed. Analysts live in dread of the ""unattended dot"" that should have been connected but was not. Will the Boston bombing lead to permanent increases in security? Security nationwide has already gone up a notch, as can be expected in the immediate wake of any major terrorist event. This is driven in part by fears that the attack is the beginning of a wave of attacks, a reality that must be accepted particularly while those responsible remain at large. The 1993 World Trade Center bombing was followed by a second conspiracy to continue the terrorist campaign. Eric Rudolph, the man responsible for the 1996 bombing during the Olympics in Atlanta, carried out further bombings before he was apprehended. When the Times Square bomber was prompted to flee, he already had other targets in mind. Terrorist attacks, especially if successful, can invite imitation, making it risky to sidestep the instinct to tighten security. Even discounting the possibility of copycat attacks, major terrorist events still invariably inspire increased threats and reports of suspicious objects and unusual behavior in the short term. Authorities must prepare for these. Attempted terrorist attacks on airliners have prompted swift and permanent increases in security. The Shoe Bomber's attempt to bring down an airliner in 2001 led to requirements to remove shoes at security checkpoints. The discovery in 2006 of a plot to bring down commercial airliners with liquid explosives promptly led to restrictions on liquids. The Underwear Bomber's failed attempt to blow up an airliner in 2009 prompted the deployment of full body scanners. But in these cases, there was a security regime already in place--a security checkpoint where new procedures could easily be added and new technology deployed. Protecting public spaces is much more difficult. Keeping terrorists from taking over or blowing up commercial airliners offers a net security benefit, but these results cannot easily be duplicated at other targets. If denied access to one public space, a determined terrorist need only choose from limitless alternative locations where roughly the same results can be achieved. Securing a marathon against the repetition of the Boston bombing would be massive and costly undertaking. The Boston Marathon had 27,000 runners, and a half million spectators. The bombs went off at the finish line, but they could have been detonated at other points along the 26-mile route. And if denied access to the marathon, a determined terrorist bomber would still have numerous other venues where the same body count could be achieved. Nonetheless, we could see some changes. In 1998, the U.S. government created National Special Security Events, which established a framework for enhanced security with support from federal agencies, including the Secret Service, the FBI, and FEMA. When an event is designated an NSSE, security protections are ramped up and usually include a heavier police presence, bomb-sniffing dogs, WMD detection systems, sharpshooters, and restrictions on air space. NSSEs have included political events like international summits, the major political conventions, the presidential inauguration, the State of the Union address, and the funerals of former presidents. The 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City and the 2002 Super Bowl in New Orleans were the first sporting events designated for enhanced security. While theoretically all mass gatherings are potential terrorist targets, not every sports contest or other event can be given NSSE status. The costs would be prohibitive. In the wake of the Boston bombing, Congress may want to revisit this issue, although fiscal realities will make it hard to do much more. Will the Boston bombing lead to a curtailment of liberties? All countries faced with a terrorist threat have changed the rules to facilitate the collection of intelligence, broaden police powers, create new domains of crime, and in some case, alter trial procedures. In the United States, the threat put pressure on law enforcement authorities, who are traditionally more reactive, to become better at anticipating threats and intervening before a terrorist attack occurs. The United States did not adopt preventive detention, which exists in some democracies, although President Bush and President Obama have claimed that they already had the authority to detain terrorist suspects indefinitely and without trial. Congress later codified this in legislation, which was subsequently amended, but the debate surrounding it revealed a blurring of the lines between legal protocols and battlefield rules. It would be incorrect to say that civil liberties in America were savaged after 9/11, but in the years since that awful event, the United States has put into place an institutional and legal infrastructure that easily could become oppressive. Thus far, the new authorities have been used judiciously, but a major terrorist event could alter that. The Boston bombing lacks the scale to rattle the republic, but with broader government power we dance a bit closer to the edge of tyranny. How will the Boston bombing affect public attitudes? Will it thrust the nation back into a shadow of fear like that cast by 9/11? That seems doubtful, although the Boston bombing will remind us to remain realistic about risk. Courage is easy here--the terrorist threat to the individual remains statistically minuscule. We face far greater danger every day in our automobiles. In the 1970s, the United States experienced 50 to 60 terrorist bombings a year from left-wing extremists, anti-Castro fanatics, Puerto Rican separatists, and others pursuing foreign agendas. True, unlike today's terrorists who are determined to kill in quantity, these earlier attacks were mostly symbolic--pipe bombs detonated at midnight outside government buildings and corporate headquarters--but there were casualties. People still went to work. The trains kept on running. The nation survived. Reminded of the terrorist threat, people are likely to be more tolerant of all security measures. This will not last. Americans are a quarrelsome lot who resist intrusions on their privacy or person. A positive development is that Americans have become more conscious and more engaged in their own security. This helps those charged with security and has great psychological utility. Lack of involvement contributes to passivity and creates a sense of helplessness. Members of the public can report suspicious activities and are invited to assist investigators. It is generally low-yield ore but citizens' tips have foiled terrorist plots. More broadly, public involvement fosters a sense of self-reliance. As America again buries its dead and prays for the recovery of the injured, it also must come to terms with broader societal wounds, freshly reopened. The initial instincts to attack the threat will be strong. The risk of overreaching in the name of homeland security is great. But the best and most likely outcome of this latest attack would be a measured security response built around Americans engaging anew in their own security.

9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/04/mark_sanford_s_new_scandal_the_national_republican_campaign_committee_has.html	"It just got too weird in South Carolina for the Republican Party. Mark Sanford, the former governor running in the 1st Congressional District, no longer has the support of his national party after the latest episode in his unpredictable career. The Associated Press reported on Tuesday that Sanford's ex-wife has brought legal proceedings against him. The lawsuit is charging him with trespassing and could lead to contempt-of-court charges for disobeying a judge's order to stay away from his former wife's home. Jenny Sanford found the candidate leaving out the back of the house by the light of his cellphone. Mark Sanford, who famously told staffers he was going to hike the Appalachian Trail when he went to visit his Argentinean girlfriend, has a flair for explanations. He said that he had gone to the house to watch the Super Bowl with his 14-year-old son because ""as a father I didn't think he should watch it alone."" Who can disagree? Those Godaddy ads are reason enough to have a parent present. The Sanford-and-son story didn't wash with Washington Republicans. Because, it turns out, this wasn't a one-time thing. According to the court papers, Sanford's wife had warned him multiple times to not darken the stoop. Repeatedly he'd broken the court order asking him to stay away. Staffers at the National Republican Congressional Committee received word of the news 20 minutes before the Associated Press story hit. Campaign operatives and GOP congressional leaders had a fast powwow, and the way forward was clear. Sanford was a liability. Whatever deep currents propel Sanford's comings and goings, the NRCC no longer wanted to be tied to them like a tin can to a comet. ""We thought we were dealing with the devil we knew,"" says one operative. ""But we weren't. Do we want to waste precious resources defending a seat that we can't win right now because of these circumstances?"" The committee had to move fast before someone called on them to disavow Sanford and before other candidates were asked to defend him. It wasn't an easy decision, say those who were involved. Last week the NRCC made another such call. While Republicans were praising the president for his decision to embrace cuts in future cost-of-living increases in his budget, Rep. Greg Walden, the head of the NRCC, was bashing him for it. House Speaker John Boehner said he disagreed with Walden, but the congressman reiterated his attack. Why? The attack would help Republicans trying to get re-elected. Social Security is a powerful issue, and older voters vote. ""Our job is to get Republicans elected,"" said one party strategist. It looks like the committee made the right call about Sanford. After the news broke about the Super Bowl visit, the Washington Post reported on more drama out of South Carolina. Sanford's sons had been upset when Sanford's Argentinean girlfriend turned up at his victory party. It was the first time his oldest son had met her. Sanford's ex-wife confirmed that in a text message to the Post: ""That was indeed Bolton's first intro and both boys were quite upset and visibly so."" Sanford faces Democrat Elizabeth Colbert Busch in a May 7 election, and Republican strategists assume that even if Colbert Busch wins, a GOP candidate can win the seat back in 2014 because it is such heavily Republican territory. That is if Sanford doesn't decide to run again if he loses on May 7. He may. After all, he's already proven he likes to come back--even when he's not wanted."	Why Even Republicans Don't Want to Stand With Mark Sanford
10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/04/kermit_gosnell_abortion_trial_conservatives_took_to_twitter_to_shame_mainstream.html	"It started with a Twitpic. By April 11, the PhillyBurbs.com columnist J.D. Mullane had spent weeks watching the trial of abortionist and accused murderer Kermit Gosnell. Mullane had tweeted links to Gosnell trial updates from LifeSiteNews.com, and links that suggested a biased media was ignoring the trial--""Guns and babies: A tale of two massacres."" He'd sparred with pro-choice tweeters. ""What went into Gosnell's red waste bags was no different that what goes in the waste at any Planned Parenthood clinic,"" he'd said to another suburban columnist. ""What happens at Planned Parenthood clinic is legal, safe,"" said the columnist, Kate Fratti. ""It's not safe for the children snuffed,"" said Mullane. On April 11, Mullane covered the trial in person and noticed the rows of empty media seats. They were largely empty. ""It was just so striking to me,"" he said. ""I took out my iPhone and snapped a picture, only intending to use it in my weekly column."" Mullane retweeted the photo a few more times, with different captions, because it had been packed into a snowball. Kirsten Powers, a Fox News commentator who usually reports from the left, published a USA Today column on the ""blackout."" Troy Newman, president of the Kansas-based Operation Rescue, had been on the phone for ""five or ten minutes"" with two other pro-lifers, launching a campaign to ""Break the Gosnell Media Blackout."" People who wanted the media at the trial would tweet the accused's last name--#Gosnell--to get it trending, preferably attached to some facts about the trial. The severed feet in jars. The urine stench in the unclean facilities. The ""raining fetuses and blood."" It was, said Newman, ""a perfect case that makes the point I've been making for 20 years."" A Facebook page set out the rules, and the mission: Can you imagine the media reaction if the case were reversed and it was a pro-lifer on trial for 7 counts of 1st degree murder? Exactly. We are going to make ""new media"" work on behalf of Kermit Gosnell's innocent, helpless victims. The mainstream media is acting like nothing is happening, however--if we unite & spread the word far enough, we can FORCE the media to cover this horrific story. It worked. An estimated 106,000 #Gosnell tweets later, on April 15, Mullane reported that major networks and newspapers had sent their reporters to cover the trial--Fox News, the New York Times, the Washington Post. Hours later, after bombs went off in the last leg of the Boston Marathon, hopes of pushing this to ""the front page"" waned. But in between the Twitpic and the breaking news, there's a lesson about how conservatives can use social media--and only social media--to move the press. Why did it take social media? Conservatives' own tools weren't working. Operation Rescue had dispatched its own reporters to the trial--chiefly Cheryl Sullenger, a policy adviser to the group who spent two years in prison conspiring to blow up the Alavarado Medical Center. (She's since apologized.) Starting in March, Sullenger was filing reports from inside Gosnell's Philadelphia trial, with photos, one of a baby so large that Gosnell joked it ""could have walked to the bus stop."" It didn't cross over. There were scattered media reports on the trial, and plenty of Philadelphia-area coverage. Some magazines--Slate included--had covered the Gosnell case two years earlier, when a grand jury report of remarkable, grisly detail was put out by the city. But there was no camera in the courtroom, and news organizations didn't feel any pressure to cover the story. Thus: Twitter. The single most effective campaign to goad the media into Gosnell coverage came from Mollie Hemingway, a press critic for the blog GetReligion. Hemingway did not wait for reporters or editors to comment on the story; she didn't email them and wait for comment. ""Inspired by Kirsten Powers' USA Today column,"" she tweeted at them, then recorded the unanswered tweets for readers, starting the experiment with Associated Press social issues reporter David Crary. ""His favorite stories deal with homosexuality,"" wrote Hemingway, ""but he also gives some love to abortion-related stories."" Just not to Gosnell. This was a warm-up: Hemingway found a reporter who could personify that photo of the empty court benches. She tweeted at Sarah Kliff, the health care policy reporter for the Washington Post's WonkBlog subsite. WaPo health policy reporter @SarahKliff has 80+ site hits on Akin/Fluke/Komen and zero on Gosnell? Would love an explanation. Kliff tweeted back: Hi Molly - I cover policy for the Washington Post, not local crime, hence why I wrote about all the policy issues you mention. It was exactly the wrong response. Hemingway's item about the exchange was shared or liked on Facebook 68,000 times--nearly seven times more than the #Gosnell campaign page, which was operating independently of all this. By Friday morning Kliff's tweet was prima facie evidence for conservatives that the media was spiking the story; one site offered a ""tip line"" for any reporters whose papers spiked Gosnell coverage. By Friday afternoon, the Post was regretting that ""we didn't send a reporter sooner"" to the trial. By Monday, Kliff was in full mea culpa mode: ""When I described the case of abortion provider Kermit Gosnell on Twitter last week as a local crime story, I was clearly wrong."" Why did this work so well? Not long ago, the preferred method of browbeating the media into covering a story was ""melting the phones,"" or deluging a reporter with emails. Why were tweets and Twitpics so much better equipped to turn on the shame-rays? Easy: It's completely public. It's a limiting medium, too, one that limits a reporter's response to 140 characters. That's excruciating for a member of the fourth estate; I once ticked off a longform magazine writer and got a five-paragraph email demanding that I tweak one sentence describing his article. There's no real entry fee to Twitter, no difference between the user with 40 followers, the media critic with a question, or the TV anchor who wonders where this hashtag came from. Almost every factor that elevated the #Gosnell story was present for the Trayvon Martin story. That's not comparing the facts of the cases; that's just saying, the hashtag knows no mercy. Neither does the news cycle. By Monday afternoon, the media trend-spotters who'd rediscovered Gosnell were combing Twitter for Boston Marathon survivors and witnesses. In the Philadelphia courtroom, surrounded--maybe temporarily--by the national press, Mullane was eyed warily by a bailiff. "" 'Anybody who is seen taking pictures, we are taking the phone and throwing it in the toilet,' "" said the bailiff, according to Mullane. "" 'You're never getting it again.' That's one reason, maybe, that TV isn't interested in the story."""	How Conservatives Used Twitter to Goad the Media into Covering the Philly Abortion Trial
11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/04/barack_obama_s_budget_proposal_the_president_needs_to_start_courting_democrats.html	"While President Obama invites Republicans to his dinner table, his liberal allies are at the gates. On Wednesday night, President Obama dines with GOP senators at the White House. It's the second act in a dinner theater that started with a meal with another group of Republican senators at the Jefferson Hotel a month ago. Obama also made public peace offerings Wednesday to those Republicans: cuts to Social Security and Medicare in his budget that he hopes will entice conservatives to a grand budget bargain. Those measures enraged his liberal allies so much that they marched on the White House gates Tuesday to deliver 2 million petitions calling on him not to make those cuts. If only the protesters could have waited and showed up for Wednesday night's dinner. Obama's charm offensive grand bargain strategy requires angry members of his base. ""I'm doing something hard with my base,"" he could say, pulling back the White House drapery to show his guests the angry liberal mob, ""and so you need to give in on tax revenue, even if it angers your base."" So, for the moment, the louder the shouting from the president's allies, the better. But with each decibel, Obama is going to have to clear another minute on his calendar for future dinners with Democrats. If he wants to reach the grand bargain he dreams about, he's going to need those Democrats in the end. The Obama strategy relies on theater. There is nothing substantively new about Obama's budget plan. He has offered versions of the same plan privately to Republican leaders, but now he's trying to go around those leaders. One requirement for building trust with Republican senators is putting these offers on paper. This is meant to show individual senators that he is making good on the promises he has made in private conversations, but it also offers them the cover they need with their constituents. If senators are going to flirt with tax increases, they have to show their voters that they purchased something in return. Now they can point to the president's public effort on entitlements. But wait, how do we know that Obama is really making a sacrifice? Just look at how upset his supporters are. Indeed, they are upset. The phones are melting at the Democratic National Committee with angry Democrats registering their complaints about the president's proposals. ""'Chained' CPI: Two Million Times 'No!' "" said the AFL-CIO. Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich took to the whiteboard, and Moveon.org launched a petition drive. On the most contentious provision--chained consumer price index--Democrats have policy, political, and tactical arguments against it. As a policy matter, they argue that the theory behind shrinking the inflation adjustment doesn't apply to older voters. The theory is that prices aren't increasing as fast as the existing CPI suggests because people substitute one product for another when prices change. Older voters, who spend their money on health care and housing, can't substitute one cheaper good for another as easily. It also bumps the working poor off government assistance programs faster because tax brackets, which are also adjusted using the CPI, wouldn't rise as fast. Politically, Democratic strategists say it's dumb to infuriate your base in a non-presidential election year when turning out your base is more important than ever. (On the other hand, said one strategist, railing against the president may help some Democrats raise money.) Finally, as a negotiating strategy, the president's allies think he has given away entitlement reforms too early in the process. Republicans will move the goal posts, asking for even more, or asking that the president simply make the CPI fix and not require any tax revenue in return. Obama has said it's a package deal, but his congressional allies argue that if he started here on entitlement cuts, he's going to have to go even further for a final compromise. Underlying all of this is the fear that the president is only interested in his own political legacy. Though Republicans worry that Obama's entire outreach strategy is a trick to make them look bad in the 2014 election, a number of Democrats think he would sell out his principles to cement a legacy-enhancing grand bargain and leave them to fend for themselves. There are reasons the president's allies shouldn't be so worried. The president can only go so far. If his grand bargain dream comes true and enough Republicans support a deal to get it through the Senate, Speaker John Boehner would probably have to allow a vote in the House. The more Democrats Obama loses, the more Republicans he'll need to pass the bill. If that comes to pass, he'll have to give up even more (and perhaps too much to get those Republican votes). Alternatively, he'll have to suck up to Democrats the way he is Republicans right now in the hopes of charming enough of them back into line. How about dinner, breakfast, and a fundraising trip to my state? The president's supporters have also made a political case to nervous liberals. If the grand bargain gambit fails, Obama will be able to campaign against Republicans as being unreasonable. He took a risk by offering cuts to entitlements, angered his party, and Republicans still wouldn't budge. This is another way in which those protests help the larger cause. Later, if the big deal fails, the size of the protests will remind people how much more willing the president was to take a risk for an agreement than Republicans were. Chained CPI will not have passed, and Democrats will be in a stronger position politically. On the other hand, if by offering chained CPI, Obama starts a process that results in a grand bargain, Democrats will all benefit from the general political goodwill that will come to the president and his party. That's a tougher sell. He may want to schedule a dinner for Democrats now."	Why Obama May Want to Invite Democrats to Dinner

Mitch McConnell is the least likely politician to get caught in a secret recording discussing the dark arts of campaigning. He usually says that stuff on the record. The four-term senator speaks openly about his political motivations. You may remember that in October 2010, McConnell told Major Garrett, then of National Journal, ""The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president."" The recording was disclosed by Mother Jones reporter David Corn, who also discovered the famous ""47 percent"" video starring Mitt Romney. (Not since the Grateful Dead has an institution done so much with bootlegs.) McConnell and his staff can be heard plotting how to defeat his potential opponent, actress Ashley Judd, using her public remarks about religion, America, and her battle with depression. In the wake of the report, McConnell has asked the FBI to investigate whether his office was bugged and his campaign manager has accused the senator's political enemies of ""Nixonian tactics."" Stephen Law of American Crossroads--and a former McConnell aide--called on liberal groups to confirm they had no involvement in the recording. (American Crossroads ran an anti-Judd ad days after the secretly recorded meeting.) Democrats wonder why the senator's official staff was working on opposition research. It's still spring, but we should settle in for a summer stock performance of umbrage-taking. Before this drama concludes, we should embrace a truth at the heart of this recording: We are in the era of the permanent campaign. At the time the recording was made, the November 2014 election was 21 months away, and McConnell was knee deep in strategy about a woman who hadn't even entered the race (or any previous political contest for that matter). He's a hands-on political operator, sure, but it's not just McConnell who is thinking about the next election. Strategists in both parties say that technological and strategic innovations have moved campaign start dates even earlier than before. The next elections are also at the heart of the big policy debates. The 2014 election is at the center of the gun control debate. The debate over immigration reform is motivated in large measure by Republicans worried about their presidential chances in 2016. This is obvious. Suggesting a politician is worried about the next campaign is like accusing them of giving a speech. Still, the ""permanent campaign"" charge is thrown around as though it has the power to harm. The National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee has attacked Obama for it. When Rand Paul threatened to filibuster gun legislation, fellow Republican Sen. Tom Coburn suggested it was just about his 2016 presidential ambitions. Speaking Monday, President Obama said that that the gun control debate was not about politics, but he is encouraging voters to contact their elected officials because he knows those officials will be moved if they think their electoral chances are threatened. The hypocrisy about the permanent campaign is as old as the permanent campaign. After Bill Clinton's presidency of permanent campaigning, Dick Cheney declared early in Bush's first term that ""The days of the war room and the permanent campaign are over."" But Clinton never gave James Carville or Dick Morris an official job. President George Bush installed his top political adviser, Karl Rove, in the White House to tend not only to Bush's political interests but also to provide counsel on House and Senate races. Denying the obvious became so commonplace that President Bush felt comfortable telling reporters on Jan. 2, 2003 that he wasn't thinking about his next campaign minutes before huddling with Rove for his first extended strategy session for the 2004 campaign. Obama's top campaign adviser David Axelrod was also his top White House adviser and President Obama also has learned to deny that he is campaigning while he is campaigning. Last week, while on a trip to raise money for Democratic candidates, the president decried the perpetual campaign at a campaign fundraiser. The way it usually works is that after a party complains about the permanent campaign they turn around and copy it. ""We made a lot of jokes about the community organizer,"" says one top Republican campaign strategist about President Obama's campaign organization, ""but it turns out he was organizing communities and now we're going to school on that."" Campaign strategists say that even though the permanent campaign has been growing over the last few cycles, there are even more incentives to get started early today. The influence of outside super PACs has meant candidates have to be on guard sooner. A candidate has to have a team of pollsters and strategists ready and on call so that they can respond to any attacks. Conversely, candidates who are vulnerable have to poll to learn about their specific vulnerabilities and craft positive ads to shore themselves up. Or, like McConnell, you have to pound potential opponents and scare them out of running. McConnell's campaign ran its first ad in February. He's a special case since he's the top Senate Republican, which makes him an attractive symbolic target, but a host of other senators up for re-election in 2014 have also seen ads run for or against them. ""This is the earliest we've seen it,"" says Elizabeth Wilner, vice president of Kantar Media CMAG, which tracks campaign and issue advertising. In the past, the political advertising in nonelection years focused on issues. Now a greater percentage is focused on actual lawmakers, says Wilner. To have enough money to run television ads and pay everyone, you have to start the fundraising extra early. If you talk about gun control legislation with members of Congress from either party, it only takes a few minutes for the conversation to turn political. Which of the five senate Democrats up for re-election in Republican states can afford to sign on to gun legislation? What penalty will Republican senators pay if they cross the NRA? As Ron Fournier reported in National Journal, Republican Rep. Scott Rigell of Virginia is now being targeted in the next election because of his support of a gun trafficking bill. The entire thrust of Michael Bloomberg's ad campaign is that he will punish members of Congress who do not back restrictions on guns in the 2014 election. It's not even too early to think about the 2016 election. That's how Republican Sen. Pat Toomey's recent move toward an agreement on background checks for gun purchases has been read. Toomey, a fiscal conservative, is not up for re-election for another three years, but Pennsylvania is a blue state with moderate voters whom he has to court, particularly since he'll be running in a presidential-election year. Democratic turnout will probably be higher. No Republican presidential candidate has won the state since 1988. A number of Republicans think the party will only have a shot at reaching Hispanic voters if its members back comprehensive immigration reform. So when Sen. John McCain was asked why Republicans were working so hard for comprehensive immigration reform, he said, ""Elections, elections."" If you're looking for what motivates politicians in Washington, that's always been a pretty good answer, but now, more than ever, we should just accept that we're in a permanent campaign."	"How the ""Permanent Campaign"" Has Taken Over Our Politics"
13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/04/margaret_thatcher_dies_the_former_british_prime_minister_is_a_hero_to_american.html	"Two summers ago, as it rolled out its all-economy all-the-time message, the Mitt Romney campaign borrowed a slogan from Margaret Thatcher. A Web ad appearing on news sites showed a bending unemployment line--sorry, queue--of sad-looking people in outdated clothes. Above this, the slogan: OBAMA ISN'T WORKING. It was a loving tribute, stock photo and all, to LABOUR ISN'T WORKING, one of the slogans that elected Thatcher in 1979. ""The unemployment rate in England was lower than today in the [United States],"" Romney strategist Stuart Stevens told me then. ""No President has ever been re-elected with a net loss job record, because no President has ever had a net loss."" Thatcher won three elections. Romney didn't. Already, the loss of Thatcher is being felt more acutely among American conservatives than the defeat of that nice businessman with the wingtips and the gaffes. Romney was brought low by suggesting that voters who felt ""entitled"" or got ""gifts"" from the state would vote Democratic. Republicans denounced him. Imagine if he'd said, ""there's no such thing as society"" or ""no one would remember the Good Samaritan if he'd only had good intentions"" or ""it's exciting to have a real crisis on your hands."" American conservatives viewed Thatcher as a saint, and as an example. By the late 1970s, they saw the United Kingdom as a cautionary tale of what happened when socialism came to a market economy--and when both parties went along with it. In 1976, the Labour government went ""cap in hand to the IMF"" for a bailout. In 1977, American Spectator editor-in-chief R. Emmett Tyrell published The Future That Doesn't Work, a collection of essays about the obvious decline of Great Britain. After Thatcher won, as Charles Krauthammer told Politico, ""her example in a much more far-left country and an even more sclerotic economy really sent a message that it can be done."" That's why American conservatives have largely won the argument about Thatcher. They've had less luck copying her. The chief reason is that the United Kingdom in the late 1970s was far more ruined than the United States in 2013. In 1979, after 34 years of nationalization, the state effectively owned the gas industry, the steel industry, the airline industry, the rest of the energy industry, and even Jaguar and Rolls-Royce. That's all been sold off now, and the state won't own them again. (In 1995, the Labour Party nixed ""clause 4,"" the line of its constitution that committed the party to ""common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange."") Could conservatives copy Thatcher on taxes? In one way, no: She came in with a higher baseline for cuts. Today, Paul Ryan pledges to lower the nightmarish 39.6 percent top income rate to 25 percent. Thatcher was greeted by a top tax rate of 83 percent; she cut it to 60 percent. In 1988, the last year she really moved the numbers, the top rate fell to 40 percent and the bottom rate to 25 percent. But that wasn't all she did. Budgets in Washington don't mean much anymore--the president proposes his, the Republicans propose theirs, and after some slap-fights about ideology and principles they just spend a bunch of money. Budgets in Westminster are announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and then ... well, that's it. You win the election, you govern. (And in Britain's functional three-party system, you can win without a popular majority. Thatcher's greatest victory came in 1983, when the Tories won 43.9 percent of the vote and the left had split between Labour and the Social Democratic Party. Add this to the list of things American conservatives can't copy.) That was how Thatcher was able to move so much more rapidly than Reagan, and that was how she made her tax cuts add up. Those 1979 cuts were paid for by a near-doubling of the sales tax, from 8 percent to 15 percent. America's conservatives don't know what to do about the sales tax. In the hands of Herman Cain, it became, briefly, part of a populist-sounding economic plan that would only punish the freeloaders. But no one who actually leads the GOP buys into this. Here, the VAT is a looming danger from the liberals who want to fund an expanded welfare state. Could the United Kingdom have drawn this down if Thatcher was willing to unwind the National Health Service? Well, possibly, but we know that a 1982 proposal to do just that--viewed sympathetically by Thatcher--had to be completely denounced, again and again. Today's Republicans want their party to repeal Obamacare and its mandates whenever they next take power. They want taxes to be flatter, but it was a revolt against a sort of flat tax that ended Thatcher's premiership. She found out how far she could take libertarian economics, then ran up against the barriers. So Republicans accentuate the positive. Joe Lhota, who's running for mayor of New York, celebrated Thatcher for understanding ""the power of individual freedom versus the tyranny of government collectivism."" She proved that a miserable, statist political consensus was wrong, and how often does that happen? She did this with conviction. In The Path to Power, her memoir of the years before 1979, Thatcher remembered reading Friedrich Hayek and other conservative or libertarian authors whom the commies couldn't stand. ""By their wonderful mockery of socialist follies,"" she wrote, ""they ... gave us the feeling that the other side simply could not win in the end. That is a vital feeling in politics; it eradicates past defeats and builds future victories."" She could distinguish between the two. After Tony Blair took power, after--for the first time--a Labour government didn't try to nationalize more industry, Thatcher was asked about her greatest achievement. Her apocryphal answer: ""New Labour."" She won, and she realized she won, and Britain's social democrats couldn't really contest the point. Their Conservative Party has moved on, racing away from Thatcher's ""Victorian"" views on gay rights, embracing climate science, even changing the party logo from a blue torch to an impressionist green tree. Thatcher's American admirers might evolve, too."	Why American Conservatives Miss Margaret Thatcher So Much
14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/04/_90_percent_of_americans_favor_background_checks_the_nra_is_able_to_stop.html	"""I ask every American to find out where your member of Congress stands,"" said President Obama. In the east room of the White House, flanked by the grieving-but-stalwart family of gun-crime victims, the president was talking--again--about universal background checks. ""If they're not part of that 90 percent who agree that we should make it harder for a criminal or somebody with a severe mental illness to buy a gun, then you should ask them, why not? Why are you part of the 10 percent?"" Democrats have clung to that 90 percent number like the last life vest off a downed aircraft carrier. After the Newtown massacre, sure, some of their congressional leaders would introduce assault weapons bans, and magazine clip restrictions, and other pieces of gun legislation that couldn't pass. The party would debate this in public, then triage, then focus on passing background checks. How could Republicans seriously oppose background checks? Even the donor class was in on the plan. The problem: 90 percent doesn't always mean ""90 percent."" On Thursday morning, Quinnipiac University released a poll that asked a follow-up to the background checks question. Nine in 10 backed the concept, but 48 percent of people worried that the state would ""use that information in the future to confiscate legally owned guns."" By a 15-point margin, independents agreed: The suede-denim secret police might want to take their weapons. Did Democrats not know this was going to happen? Ask any NRA spokesman, and he'll repeat it: Background checks lead inexorably to a national gun registry and firearm reclamation campaign, right in time for the apocalypse. Wayne LaPierre was predicting this long before Barack Obama became president. ""If the text of the Magna Carta was added to a gun bill,"" says Jim Kessler, vice president of policy for the Third Way think tank, ""the NRA would call it a gateway to a gun registry."" Here's what they mean. There is no ""national gun registry."" The 1986 Firearm Owners Protection Act explicitly prohibits it. The working version of the background checks bill, S. 374, does not create a national registry. It gets around the problem of regulating gun show or person-to-person gun sales by preventing sales ""unless a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer has first taken possession of the firearm."" This is problematic, and demands a level of bureaucracy that Americans aren't used to. Of course it does; it was introduced by Democrats. ""When you talk about background checks, what are you talking about?"" says Newt Gingrich, whose general rule of politics is to pick an issue with supermajority support and stick to it. ""My grandson was given a shotgun by his father. Now, if I decide to give a shotgun to my grandson, do I have to get a background check?"" The phantom ""national gun registry"" could fix that--but again, it's not part of this bill. Right now, when you go to buy your Bushmaster, you submit to a background check by signing ATF form 4473. That records your personal information, but it stays--for 20 years--with the registered gun seller. ""After 20 years, the seller can burn it, shred it, whatever,"" says Steve Schneider, owner of Atlantic Guns in Silver Spring, Md. ""The federal government can't just come in and say they want to see all of your records. They can see it as part of a criminal investigation, because the background check isn't registering the gun. It's approving the person who bought it."" And after a person passes the background check, getting the information about him means showing up, with a legal justification. In the NRA's nightmare scenario, without some repeal of the 1986 law, government agents would need to raid gun shops to find out where gun owners lived and kick off the Great Confiscation. I asked Charles Steele, owner of Steele's Gun Shop in Lewes, Del., how that might go down. ""I'd tell them to bring their own marshmallows,"" he says. ""I'd start a fire with those papers."" That's the attitude that's held off a ""mission creep,"" as Gun Owners of America puts it, ever since this paperwork started being required. The requirements started 45 years ago. But the fear of a national gun registry has withered every push for expanded background checks. In our last national moment of maybe-kind-of-thinking-about new gun laws, after the Columbine massacre, the NRA convinced Republicans that the slope was going to get slippery. ""I was working on the Republican side last night with a number of Republican colleagues that are whipping their members,"" said New York Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, the Democratic Sisyphus of gun-control bills, at a 1999 press conference. ""Each one came up and they said, Carolyn, you know, your bill is going to have an instant registry for the federal government. And I said no ... we put that in because we know that was a big concern for the NRA. There will be no national gun registry."" Fourteen years on, Democrats have a little more clout--a majority in the Senate, for example. But they're hearing the same dystopian fears of a gun registry. It can defeat them again."

15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/04/congress_ends_furloughs_at_federal_aviation_administration_the_last_minute.html	"Before I go on vacation, I work a little harder. It makes me feel like I deserve the break. Charlie Chaplin said if he didn't write every day, he felt he didn't deserve dinner. Members of Congress apparently feel the same way. Before they went on recess this past week, they were hard at work on their most sustained long-term project: tanking their approval ratings. By now you've heard about the last-minute legislation that bailed out air travelers on Friday. Hell hath no fury like a crowded departure lounge, so Congress lunged to give the Federal Aviation Administration flexibility so that it wouldn't have to  ""furlough air traffic controllers in order to comply with sequestration. Conventional wisdom seems to be that this deal was politically terrible for Democrats. Anything that smooths the rough edges of sequestration makes it less likely people will seek out a more balanced budget to replace it, of the kind the president is offering. Republicans say the legislation--which didn't give the FAA more money but gave it more flexibility to work with what it has--proves you can shrink the government and be smart about it. (Ezra Klein argues the legislation was dumb for Republicans, too). It's worth pausing for a moment to evaluate how the sequester virus has mutated during its short life. What started as a tool to focus Congress on long-term solutions to that part of the budget that needs the most attention, is now pushing Congress even further into obsessing about short-term fixes in that portion of the budget that doesn't need the attention. To recap how we got here: Members of Congress are elected to solve the big problems of the day. The cockeyed budget is a big one. America isn't growing very fast (since the recession ended in mid-2009, quarterly growth has averaged a measly 2 percent), and the spoils are uneven. (In the first two years of the recovery, the mean net worth of the upper 7 percent of wealthiest households went up 28 percent. The lower 93 percent went down 4 percent.) The tax code is too complicated, and entitlements need to be redesigned to accommodate an aging population. These are tricky problems that, as Mitt Romney would say, need to be discussed in quiet rooms. Congress was incapable of having these conversations, so it designed sequestration: across-the-board cuts in the portion of the budget where people would feel it the most. The theory was that this pain and grief would force lawmakers to have that conversation about long-term problems and solutions. It didn't work. Congress still couldn't be convinced to think long-term. This FAA fix compounds the problem. It represents yet another round of short-term thinking. Congress is moving in the wrong direction, and it's also making it harder to reverse course. Answering the bigger budget questions requires engaging in a public debate. That means to get anything done lawmakers must have some measure of credibility. Whether the topic is taxes, investment, or entitlements, there is one essential argument provided by elected officials who are trying to persuade their colleagues and voters to favor change or reform: Do this thing you might not like because the alternative will be worse. But no one is going to accept your argument if they think you're crying wolf. So the first reactions from voters and pundits to the sequestration-nightmare scenarios were that some politicians were being overly dramatic. It's not going to be that bad, and if it does get bad, politicians will scramble to fix it. Congress proved the skeptics right by fixing the FAA when people squawked. Instead of making people think that lawmakers were right when they predicted calamity, this work-around is likely to have the opposite result. No one is going to pay attention to the peculiarities of the FAA budget--why it was relatively easy to fix and why the fix in this case is hard to apply elsewhere. Instead, they are likely to go on believing that all non-FAA sequester-related scenarios have been overblown (otherwise Congress would take action like they did last week!). People won't worry that sequestration is causing great harm because look at how quickly Congress can act when the situation demands it. Meanwhile, the long-term problems still aren't being addressed and the people without lobbyists who depend on government won't get heard. So Medicare patients are not receiving chemotherapy and fewer elderly recipients of Meals on Wheels are getting food. The danger is that congressional warnings are going to become like renewal notices from your favorite magazine. You seem to get one every month, even though your expiration is months from now. You'll keep throwing them away unopened until they send you the pink one saying your subscription is going to be canceled. That's when you take action. That might be fine when it comes to your subscription to Garden & Gun, but it's not so smart when it comes to your mortgage payment. By the time they're holding the auction for your house in your front yard, it's too late."	Why Congress' FAA Fix Will Make Sequestration Worse
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/04/george_w_bush_presidential_library_dedication_presidential_libraries_should.html	"In 2007, I had the privilege of becoming the first director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum. My job was to move Nixon's presidential materials from the Washington, D.C. area, where they had been kept as federal property because of the Watergate investigation, to California, where Nixon's friends and supporters had built a private library in 1990. My job involved transforming the once private library, which had a reputation for being a national center of Watergate denial, into a public, nonpartisan facility. Sometime in 2010, I was surprised (and frankly, a little proud) when my boss at the National Archives told me that my name had been invoked in negotiations over the future George W. Bush Presidential Library. Apparently, the George W. Bush Foundation was worried ""some future Naftali"" would ""want to put up a torture exhibit."" It's true that I had managed to anger Nixon loyalists. As part of the Nixon Library's rebranding mission, I had brought in serious critics of the former president--notably Elizabeth Drew and John Dean--to the library and vowed to have an honest exhibit on Watergate. And the Nixonians made their feelings known. In 2009, the private Nixon Foundation sent a letter to every living former president denouncing me personally--""Who is this Naftali,"" a puzzled President Bill Clinton is said to have asked, ""and why should I care?""--for messing up the library system by trying to achieve nonpartisanship in Yorba Linda. The Bushies were apparently arguing for control of the temporary exhibit gallery to prevent it from being used by a future federal director for an exhibit that might cast Bush 43 in a negative light. The creation of every new presidential library involves negotiations over an agreement--a treaty--between the federal government and the former president and his representatives. Called a Joint Use Agreement, the contract divides up responsibility for the space at the library between the private presidential foundation, which is usually dedicated to promoting the positive legacy of a president, and the American people. Areas controlled by the private presidential foundation, such as the impressive Air Force One Pavilion at the Reagan Library, can have partisan events such as Republican presidential debates. Those spaces controlled by the National Archives on behalf of the American people, however, are legally mandated to be nonpartisan. In dealing with the Bush Foundation, the National Archives apparently held the line--as it did with the private Nixon Foundation--and, according to the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum website, all of the galleries that will be dedicated today are indeed controlled by all of us. If the final agreement is anything like the treaty governing the Nixon Library, the National Archives has veto power on your behalf over all exhibits and programs at this new presidential library. That's right. Whatever you think of President George W. Bush, you control the Bush Library. And you should, since every year you will spend about $4 million on it--the same amount of public funds spent on every one of the 12 other presidential libraries. One of the misconceptions about presidential libraries is that they are supposed to be shrines. (Don't worry if you believe that--many presidential relatives do, too.) But Congress is not interested in creating shrines to the branch of government at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. It is one of the strange outcomes of the separation of powers doctrine that one branch has to pay to archive and display the documents and trinkets of a competing branch. In recent years, Congress has shown its displeasure by trying to narrow the streams of public money that go to presidential libraries. The younger President Bush had to raise a lot more money than his father, not just because construction costs had increased in 15 years, but because Congress expects the friends of presidents to create an endowment to help shoulder the burden of maintaining the buildings forever. There's nothing wrong with that necessarily. But in its zeal to reduce the public burden for these libraries, Congress has made them even more vulnerable to presidential friends and family. Unwilling to use public funds for these programs or exhibitions, Congress expects the library's private presidential partner to foot that bill. The effect is that the National Archives finds itself passing the tin cup to raise money for museums, exhibits, and book talks from groups that are not interested in promoting objectivity. The National Archives is nonpartisan; it is supposed to act in the spirit of open government and transparency and be a leader in the custodianship of history. Presidential families (though there are notable exceptions like the Truman, Johnson, Ford, and Carter families, and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg) often oppose nonpartisan programming and have often placed obstacles in the way of releasing materials. Another misconception is that, like it or not, presidents and their loyalists deserve a watering hole. Since we Americans regularly ""throw the bums out,"" regardless of ideology, there are almost as many Democratic presidential libraries as Republican ones. So, why not let them be? Democrats can visit the Clinton Library and Republicans the Reagan Library. I have to admit that this was my view until I ran one. These presidential libraries, however, have an educational mission that is much more important to the country than the reputation of a former president. Depending on the location, these libraries receive between 60,000 and 400,000 visitors a year. And students and teachers around the country use these libraries' online resources in the classroom. You cannot look at the faces of the kids and their teachers that come to your museum without feeling pangs of regret if what they see is not as accurate and informative as it could be. At the Nixon Library, 12,000 school kids on formal school tours visited each year. Before the National Archives took over in 2007, nearly 200,000 students had been taught that the Democrats used Watergate to overturn the electoral result of 1972 and that Richard Nixon did nothing that presidents before him had not done; the only difference was that he got caught. Will the George W. Bush Library echo the insecurity of the president's supporters who worried about letting the National Archives put up a future torture exhibit? The test will not just be the permanent galleries that we get a look at for the first time this week, but the tenor of the programs sponsored by the library. Will the library invite serious writers who opposed the Iraq War in the spirit of the Johnson Library's invitation to Robert Caro? Will the school tours be run with an educational or a rehabilitative mission for the reputation of the 43rd president? And what about the temporary exhibits sponsored by the library, will they be nonpartisan or just echo chambers for Bush-era White House spin? The new Bush Library will be as nonpartisan as you want it to be. All of the libraries read the emails, letters, and social media about how they are doing their job and how they could do it better. If you are a teacher, contact the library and see what online materials they have for your students. And if you consider the materials one-sided, let them know. The Bush Library, like all other presidential libraries, will have an education specialist, paid by public funds, whose job will be to foster an inviting, ""no-spin"" zone. If the public wants serious discussion about No Child Left Behind, the consequences of the Iraq War, or why the government crossed the line and used torture after 9/11, there is no good reason why these discussions cannot occur in the same building as where the documents that explain those policies exist. Academic historians long ago shifted their focus away from the White House, but for most of us American history is still heavily presidential. What we learn about these outsize individuals marks what we think about ourselves. If children are taught that truth lies solely with the presidents of one stripe or another, that no president did wrong, that all presidents were consistent in what they thought or did, and that history flows from the Oval Office, then we invite a continuation of the toxic national politics that have made this country nearly ungovernable."

Bush should have been impeached, but it didn't happen."" The speaker was North Carolina Rep. Walter Jones, a safe Republican incumbent who has spent years apologizing for his early Iraq War boosterism. (You'll remember him as the House member who got the cafeteria to rename french fries ""freedom fries."") The venue was the Capitol Hill Club, the quaintly posh hideaway situated between the House of Representatives and the Republican National Committee. The event was the Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity's official launch, a sober series of speeches last week from Paul and a few congressional allies. It wasn't news, per se. Jones always, always talks like this; the Paul movement was always dumping tar and dirt on the Bush legacy. ""There was not the outrage from the American people to have a president who led this country to war without the Constitution,"" said Jones, ""who led families to cry at funerals, who led moms""--he paused--""I met one whose son has half a body left but is still living!"" This was fringe talk in the Bush years, and it obviously isn't fully ""mainstream."" But since 2008, plenty of conservatives defined themselves by their distance from Bush. Tea Party groups like FreedomWorks dated the movement's origin not to Obama's win but to the September 2008 passage of TARP. Out of office, Republicans started to admit that Iraq lacked weapons of mass destruction, that the years between the invasion and the surge were squandered. ""We know the past. We know we did wrong,"" said new RNC Chairman Michael Steele at the 2009 Conservative Political Action Conference. ""My bad."" The apologists may have peaked. On Tuesday, a Washington Post/ABC News poll finds that 47 percent of all Americans (84 percent of Republicans) finally approve of Bush again, up from 33 percent (68 percent) when he left office. On Thursday, Bush allies will gather at Southern Methodist University for the opening of their friend's presidential library. Every day, an increasingly influential group of Republicans cop Bush's rhetoric on taxes and his dream of immigration reform mottled with GOP fingerprints. The Tea Party's brand replaced Bushism; slowly, definitively, Bushism is taking back its turf. ""My own view is that all the bad stuff is fading in the memory as the conservative movement defines itself in fear of the Obama excesses,"" says Dick Armey. For the first two years of Bush's presidency, Armey was the House Republican majority leader; for most of Obama's first term, Armey was the chairman of FreedomWorks. ""Obamacare, that's the cornerstone,"" he says. ""There's no doubt that the conservative movement known as the Tea Party was born out of disappointment with both parties, but today the compelling concerns are the excesses of liberalism with Obama and how the next two years would be if he won the House back."" Tribal political loyalty explains plenty of the rapprochment. Washington Republicans turned on the guy, Tea Party leaders criticized his trespasses, but the base never deserted him. Even during the failed immigration reform pushes of 2006 and 2007, the red-hottest anger got directed at Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham. In early 2010, when no Republican running for office would have clung to Bush, a mysterious group of ""small businessmen"" were buying billboards on Bush's behalf. The 43rd president leaned into frame, waving and smiling goofily; a loud yellow slogan yelled ""MISS ME YET?"" The Tea Party itself was delicate when it came to Bush-bashing. (The Paul movement, which has only grown since 2008, was always the exception.) In February 2010, a Tennessee lawyer named Judson Phillips put on a miraculously successful National Tea Party Convention, and he became, for a while, a movement spokesman. ""The Tea Party movement does not defend George W. Bush,"" said Phillips in February 2010, promoting the convention. ""George W. Bush is not exactly one of my favorite people."" Today, Phillips follows the ""Obama was worse"" line. ""The one factor, other than just the passing of time that is helping Bush,"" he says, ""is the way people remember the economy of the Bush years versus what I like to call the Great Obama Depression. If you compare the Bush economy to the Obama economy, I think a lot of people look back wistfully saying, 'I was better off 10 years ago than I am today.' "" That attitude has saved many a president from the judgment of contemporary pundits. It has restored Bill Clinton, for example, as a generally well-liked politician who made a couple of stupid mistakes. Clinton, who'd been impeached, was being restored in the public memory; Bush, who'd merely presided over seven years of war and the start of a recession, wasn't bouncing back. That was untenable. ""Many of [Bush's] supposed failures are mild compared to the current president (e.g. spending, debt),"" wrote Jennifer Rubin, reacting to the glowing Washington Post/ABC poll. ""Unlike Obama's tenure, there was no successful attack on the homeland after 9/11 ... the essence of his view on Islamic terror--that we are at war with those espousing a jihadist ideology--has been confirmed, painfully so."" Why start the ""terror clock"" after 9/11? Pure necessity. You can convince people, over time, that Bush's economic record was better than they remembered. The two land wars are tougher to explain away. You can argue that they were going perfectly well until Barack Obama arrived. Or you can say that Bush was wrong. ""The problems with the neo-cons and with the sort of nation-building notions ... they were difficult for most people,"" says Armey. ""But I do believe that that probably is going to be the Bush presidency's longest-term hangover. Look at the fact that, today, Iran has a greater influence over circumstances in Iraq than we do. We paid a heck of a high cost to put Iran in such an advantageous position with respect to Iraq."""	Why George Bush's New Popularity Makes Some Republicans So Mad 
18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/04/barack_obama_s_gun_bill_failure_no_president_could_have_passed_gun_control.html	"In the aftermath of the defeat of gun control legislation in the Senate, the Sunday New York Times offered two very different explanations for the bill's demise. In a reported piece, the paper's congressional reporter argued that gun control never had a chance to become law in Congress. Despite the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary, the structure of the Senate, its partisan makeup, and pressure from gun rights advocates made passage impossible. Then, in the opinion pages, columnist Maureen Dowd argued that it was President Obama's fault the gun bill didn't pass given that 90 percent of the public supported it. These two stories highlight the central puzzle of the Obama presidency. Is he the president who was thwarted by partisanship or did he lack the skills to manage the moment? There has been no shortage of analysis of this question, but presidencies may be like musical chairs: You are defined by where you stand when the music stops at the end of your term. (At least until historians can offer a competing judgment or explanation.) As big agenda items in Obama's second term rise and fall, snap claims about his legacy will begin to form. These judgments may also tilt people's thinking about the next president; the public may look for attributes that Obama lacked in his possible successors. Where should we come down on this? Obama could have done more--one always can do more--but it probably wouldn't have helped. If any president could have solved the problem it would have required a different skill set, one honed over a career in politics. That's not why Barack Obama was elected. In fact, the type of president who could work or cajole the Senate in this political environment would probably never have been elected in the first place. The passage of gun control legislation is not the best test of Obama's bully pulpit powers. Even those pushing hard for gun control recognized at the start that it was going to be a very tough fight. Public outcry is limited for politicians whose constituents will punish them for giving in to the outcry. Punishing the most electorally vulnerable senators will only help your opponents and, despite the groundswell after the Newtown, Conn., tragedy, polling support for background checks does not necessarily translate into political support for them. ""We knew from Day 1 that nothing was going to pass the U.S. Congress on this issue,"" says pollster Stanley Greenberg. ""There was no scenario you could look at this Congress and see that they were going to pass anything on assault weapons and background checks."" Still, Obama tried. He did the most important thing a president can do: He talked about gun control relentlessly, keeping the issue on the agenda. At a symposium on polling and the White House recently, Greenberg used Obama's push on gun control as proof of how thoroughly he can engage on an issue when he wants to--as opposed to his first-term effort to educate voters on his economic plans, which Greenberg said lacked this constancy. Obama worked on senators in private and turned the issue over to his best congressional negotiator, the little-known Joe Biden. The vice president may be mocked for his gaffes, but he knows the Senate and he helped pass the crime bill that included the last set of strict gun control measures. Obama, who has admitted that he usually thinks he can do his staff's job better than they can, had his best shot handing the issue over to Biden. Perhaps that was all weak soup. Obama's tone was far more strident after the vote failed than in the days leading up to it. You might have expected that a man who was so angry and willing to point fingers in the Rose Garden might have actually marched up to the Senate in the waning hours, as Dowd suggests. Would that theatrical innovation have done anything? Probably not, but it would have made the effort match the post-vote outrage. In the end, the president's limitations as a negotiator can't be fixed while in office. Obama doesn't relish the part of the job that he's not so good at, and it's almost universally accepted among Washington veterans that he could do a better job massaging legislation, but just because he could improve doesn't mean it would be enough. To win the gun vote would have required a virtuoso's talent for pressure and cajoling. Working the legislative angle on an issue this complicated, in this environment--especially when Obama held such a weak legislative hand--isn't something a new president can just pick up, like finding the bathroom key. You have to have had the skill going in, and Obama wasn't hired to have that skill. In fact, it was the opposite: Obama was hired because he was the anti-politician. He wasn't of Washington and he wasn't really of politics. So it should come as no surprise that he couldn't suddenly master the art of politics. He was hired to play the guitar, and he's not going to play the piano very well no matter how many times you tell him how LBJ mastered Brahms. Why is it so hard to imagine the electorate embracing a candidate today who had the talents that would have been required to pass the gun bill? Because such a candidate would have a long legislative record full of compromises and backroom deals where he or she learned how to break through gridlock and get things done. During the 2008 Democratic primary, when Hillary Clinton tried to make the distinction between the skill it takes to get things passed and the skill it takes to talk about getting things passed, she got in hot water. She said that it took LBJ to get Martin Luther King's civil rights vision through the Senate. At the time, she was accused of favoring Johnson's role over King's. She was trying to make the case that her skill working in the Senate would help her if she became president, that she was better qualified when it came to translating words into action. We will have to wait until 2016 to test this theory again."	Why Obama Couldn't Turn 90 Percent Support for Gun Control Into 60 Senate Votes
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/04/boston_marathon_bombing_media_coverage_we_shouldn_t_be_too_quick_to_condemn.html	"In the fast news moments after the Boston bombing, there was a lot of stupidity on Twitter. People were sending obviously Photoshopped pictures, linking to fake Twitter accounts, and otherwise passing on bad dope--including provisional reports from media sources. But when people got out of hand, the collective started to sanction those people. When photos started being posted of young anonymous men in the crowd, people sent around Richard Jewell's obituary to warn against early condemnation of suspects. Don't repeat what you hear on a scanner, many warned; it's almost certain to be wrong. I knew this had reached a wide audience when I saw my fifth-grader's text messages with his friends debating what you could and couldn't believe on a police scanner or whether you should be listening to one at all. There's been a lot of discussion about where traditional media and new media failed in their coverage of the Boston Marathon bombing. Good. We should call out the bad ones so that standards will be higher and celebrate the good so we'll all know where to tune in next time. But as we figure out who to listen to in the future, we should also think about a way to process these breaking news developments. As a consumer in a breaking news environment when there are fewer filters and you're switching from Reddit to CNN to Twitter to the New York Times, you're becoming an editor and not a simple passive recipient. You're watching, listening, and sharing news and stories because you want the latest as fast as possible. That's fine, but like an editor, you've got to know that if you're consistently asking for lightening fast news, you are going to get some bum information some of the time. You could disqualify the reporters who bring it to you or you could adopt a standard that fits the moment. The standard that fits the breaking news moment is to treat everything as provisional and accept the error inherent in the speed that you're demanding. So when CNN, Fox, the Associated Press, and the Boston Globe report that a suspect is in custody, that's interesting, but it's not news until they have a name and a picture. Better yet, let's see an official source at a microphone. And even then, remember Richard Jewell. If those news organizations get it wrong--as they all did in Boston--then the model for appraisal should be closer to the one we use for batters in baseball. The standards are pretty clear--we know what a ball and a strike is--but we also know how to view a strikeout in context. Those news organizations struck out on naming a suspect. Some news organizations, including ABC, NBC, and CBS, laid off the wild pitch. You could condemn those who got it wrong forever or recognize, as an editor does, that when the audience is demanding up-to-the-minute news, you're going to strike out sometimes. There are consequences: As a viewer or reader, you might rearrange your lineup and put the better hitters up top. If you're like me, you're in awe of those who can get it right so often under such fast pitching. There are limits to context. Someone who gets up to the plate and consistently throws the bat down the third base line is an obvious mess. I'm speaking, of course, about the New York Post. If you are constantly looking for news updates, whether on Twitter, CNN, or on the Web, that probably means that you want news organizations taking risks, being on a twitchy trigger. If that's true, then you should evaluate their mistakes in this context. Also, if you are thinking about this breaking news balancing act, you'll be less likely to go down blind allies, firing up emotions that aren't really justified. You will have the fastest understanding of the moment--which is distinct from the fastest information. (That will help with public officials, too. The same people being cheered Friday night were wrong about the connection to the JFK Presidential Library on Monday.) When we condemn too fast, it is the flip side of another phenomenon: We are too credulous. Slowing down the condemnation recognizes the provisional nature of the news. That might make us less likely to pass along news that, after a moment of consideration, we'll recognize is soft and might turn out to be wrong. That might begin to walk us all back from the overemphasis on breaking news. Everyone is going to embrace your breathless report with skepticism, so don't rush it out there so fast in the first place. (An actual sin that CNN committed before this past week was treating the smallest thing as ""breaking news""--even when it's not.) It's too easy to say, ""Oh, they got it wrong"" and condemn a reporter or a news organization forever. That's not only unfair to the news organization that might otherwise have a pretty good batting average in the end (like the Globe), but more important, it lets you off the hook from your ongoing responsibility as skeptic and editor. There are different degrees of inaccuracy that matter in different ways at different times. Testing each new piece of information on that standard is the lesson that should come out of the Boston bombing reporting. Fortunately, it seems like some are already learning this lesson. We're getting better as news consumers. We flock to quality, and we remind one another quickly not to go overboard. Maybe next time someone ""breaks"" something, we'll wait a minute or two longer before we believe it or retweet it. It will mean we will be as sophisticated as the journalism we are demanding.

20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/04/tamerlan_and_dzhokhar_tsarnaev_suspects_the_origins_of_the_boston_marathon.html	"The Senate's big-ticket hearing on immigration reform had been planned, fought over, and mooted for weeks. It would decide whether Marco Rubio stayed at the table or marched away! It would grip Capitol Hill reporters, finally able to cover a bill that might pass without a last-minute crisis-driven kludge! Or it would happen right as the nation turned its teary eyes to Boston and the area-wide manhunt for the 19-year-old immigrant suspected of setting up two devastating bombs along the route of the Boston Marathon. The hearing went forward--there'd been debate about whether it could--with a rump of special witnesses versed in economics-speak, but it made news only when the Senate's best-known slayer of deer went after the elephant in the room. ""We appreciate the ability to talk about immigration, particularly in light of the events in Boston,"" said Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley. The Republican ranking member of the committee had just linked Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to the entire immigration infrastructure. Solving the crime in Boston, said Grassley, would ""help shed light on the weaknesses in our system."" Democrats and Republicans shoved back, immediately. ""I'd like to ask that all of us not jump to conclusions regarding the events in Boston,"" said New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, one of eight senators who midwifed the immigration deal. ""In general, we're a safer country when law enforcement knows who is here, has their fingerprints, photos, etc; has conducted background checks; in general, no longer needs to look for needles in haystacks."" National tragedies have a funny way of convincing politicians that they were right all along. The Boston bombings were shaping the immigration debate days before any hard information emerged about a suspect. When a few outlets falsely suggested that a ""Saudi national"" had been nabbed, Iowa Rep. Steve King saw new reason to ""take a look at the visa-waiver program."" Arizona Sen. John McCain wondered whether the crisis ""may be an argument for the kind of things we're talking about."" But the suspect isn't a foreign national. There are two suspects, neither of whom needed a fresh visa to stay in the United States. They arrived here 11 and nine years ago. Tamerlan Tsarnaev carried a green card; Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was naturalized on Sept. 11, 2012. They joined a relative in the United States after living in, then fleeing, former Soviet republics along the Caucuses. In a TV interview, their uncle Ruslan Tsnari said that the brothers ""got their start as refugees, refugees from war."" How would the immigration bill, as written, have affected them? It might not have changed anything. It would allow any child or parent of a spouse of a U.S. citizen to come ashore and earn citizenship. After an 18-month period it'll crack down on siblings of American citizens. Current law, according to Sen. Schumer, has already been tweaked the right way: ""Both the refugee program and the asylum program have been strengthened in the last five years such that we are much more careful about screening people and determining who should and should not be in the country."" Terrific! And irrelevant in Boston. In the first, furtive speculation about the suspects, politicians were expecting to talk about student visas, for people just arrived in the country. Muhammad Atta got a tourist visa to the United States just 18 months before he hijacked American Airlines Flight 11. But the Tsarnaevs, as the president of Chechnya was so ready to remind us, belonged to the United States. Immigration reformers are going to bring up Boston anyway. In an interview with C-Span, Illinois Rep. Luis Gutierrez argued that a robust legalization and background check program would free up money for counterterrorism. ""If you legalize 11 million people now, there's a whole bunch of people you can take right off the table,"" he said. ""Now there's a smaller community of people that you can use that $18 billion to go after."" Sounds great, unless you're a member of some ""smaller community."" New York Rep. Peter King used the facts about Boston to make the case--as he does, all the time--for more monitoring of Muslims in the United States. ""I think we need more police and more surveillance in the communities where the threat is coming from,"" he told National Review, ""whether it's the ... Italian community with the mafia or the Muslim community with the Islamic terrorists."" That's not really part of immigration policy, though. It's not obvious that any of that would have collared someone like Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who's been remembered all day on social media as a Jay-Z quoting pothead. Maybe we're headed for a discussion about radicalization of Muslims in America, the kind that the United Kingdom has had for years, the kind that King wants. But on immigration, the most doable reforms are going to affect people whose stories sound nothing like the Tsarnaevs. Late on Friday, I talked to Haider Javed Warraich, a resident at the hospital that declared Tsarnaev's brother dead. Two days earlier, he'd published a New York Times column about his fear that the suspect would look like him, or at least bow to Mecca. He'd been half right. ""My wife and I were hoping to have a baby this year,"" said Warraich. ""I don't know what the effect will be. If our parents wanted to visit us, could they? In the past, when something like this has happened, visa issuances, visa policy, become much more strict. That's very true when you're coming from Pakistan."""	Why the Boston Bombing Just Made Immigration Reform a Little Harder
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/04/marco_rubio_defends_immigration_reform_the_florida_senator_has_become_expert.html	"Rusty Humphries has everything he needs: radio gear, a microphone, a glass of water, all-black clothes, and a bottle of 5-hour Energy. Nobody has a better space at Hold Their Feet to the Fire, the annual gathering put on by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), which brings together America's border-hawk radio hosts and dedicated teams of activists. They're holed up at the Phoenix Park Hotel in Washington, a short walk--or more typically, a shorter ride in a black Escalade--from Capitol Hill. And at the end of the day, they will talk to Marco Rubio. Humphries will get one of five Rubio interviews. First, he'll talk to the true believers. Iowa Rep. Steve King, who's campaigned against immigrant legalization his entire career in Congress, sits down to chew over the new Senate compromise. It dropped Wednesday night, all 668 pages, and the people who care are already familiar with the worst parts. King describes a provision in the bill that would forgive undocumented immigrants who'd been deported--not just evaded the law, flat-out deported. ""This sounds like a negotiation with the Palestinians,"" says Humphries. ""It's so outrageous, it's so impossible--it's most of what they want, so you say we won't give you these two or three things."" ""That is what it sounds like,"" says King. Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert, waiting for his own interview elsewhere, cuts the tension. He walks behind King and aggressively combs his hair. King whacks back at his colleague--""GOHMERT!"" The interview continues, very seriously, with general agreement that conservatives are charged with stopping another ""amnesty"" for illegal aliens, like the 1986 deal that was supposed to grant citizenship to a limited number of people while closing the border. They just want to be able to call this deal ""amnesty."" If it passes and someone living illegally in the United States wants to ""come out of the shadows,"" he has to have arrived before Dec. 31, 2011. Anyone working (illegally) in the United States who arrived before that date can fork over $500 and back taxes and become a ""registered provisional."" The registered provisional will have no access to government benefits, much like the current unregistered, undocumented worker has no access. Six years later you'll have to pay another $500. Four years later you can apply for a green card with standards pretty similar to the ones every immigrant faces--citizenship test, no criminal record, and so on. Supporters of the bill have talked themselves raw to prove that this is not amnesty. They're grabbing batons from a decade's worth of immigration reform spinners. ""The National Council of La Raza did focus groups in 2000 and found that people were open to the idea of letting illegal immigrants stay, but they really hated the word amnesty,"" says Mark Krikorian. As the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, he has been writing and rewriting ""just call it amnesty"" columns since that year. ""It's not that immigration hawks use amnesty as some kind of poison label. It's the opposite. Amnesty supporters try to change the word because they know people don't like it."" Rubio, who has spent countless hours jawing with conservative talk-radio hosts, is getting awfully close to perfecting the jargon. In 2010, when he was a conservative insurgent running for Senate, almost everything looked like amnesty. ""Earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty,"" he said during one debate. In another debate, he argued it was ""unfair to the people that have legally entered this country to create an alternative pathway for individuals who entered illegally and knowingly did so."" That was Republican scripture. FAIR and like-minded ""hawks"" call themselves ""reformers,"" too. They see the goal as a national system on the Arizona/Alabama model--""self-deportation"" that makes American life impossible for a noncitizen. The Senate compromise tosses that out. The hardliners think they know why. As Rubio's arrival time nears, two activists wait outside for him. One of them, Pat DeFilippis, wears a button that's been handed out by a rogue (i.e., non-FAIR) activist--a picture of Rubio wearing a sombrero, superimposed on the Mexican flag, between the words AMNISTIA! and RINO. (Cuban-Americans can wear sombreros, but it's highly unusual.) She's ready to give Rubio a flyer about unemployed Americans, marked ""in memory of ... all victims of illegal aliens."" He arrives. He takes the flier--""Is it two pages or one?"" As Rubio folds the paper and gives it to an aide, DeFilippis asks him to reconsider his way and ""think of the hard-working American taxpayers."" ""I think about them every day,"" says Rubio. He heads in to start the interviews. No. 1: syndicated host Mike Siegel, who kindly lectures the senator about how much he remembers about the 1986 deal. ""I was in ninth grade,"" says Rubio--a favorite talking point. Siegel pushes Rubio onto more topics he's already come up with multiple answers for, until finally asking about amnesty. What's wrong with self-deportation? ""I understand your point on that,"" says Rubio. ""But I do not believe people in the United States are going to sustain a system of stopping people at traffic stops, identifying them as illegal--the human-interest stories on it are not sustainable."" Anyway, he's not for amnesty. ""The amnesty is staying in this country,"" says Siegel. ""Again, amnesty implies that there are no consequences for doing something wrong,"" says Rubio. ""And that's not accurate here."" Rubio wraps up and carries his jacket to the next interview, a thunder-voiced Oregon conservative named Lars Larson. ""Who was the politician that said, 'I'll only be out of office if I get caught with a dead girl or a live boy?' "" asks Larson. ""Our mayor, the last mayor of Portland, got caught with a live boy, and he survived two recall elections. Because he was gay."" ""All right,"" says Rubio. ""Not that there's anything wrong with that!"" says Larson. The interview goes better than that--Larson announces that ""I'm gonna call it amnesty"" when he talks about the Rubio plan, and Rubio politely differs. Why is the senator willing to provisionally recognize some immigrants even before the border's secure? ""I want to know who's here now, and I want to freeze the problem in place,"" says Rubio. ""I don't want the problem to get bigger."" Interview by interview, he ably defends amnesty from the charge that it is, in fact, amnesty. Rubio's gauntlet only ends when he glides past Steve King--he's still there, hearing the stories of activists whose family members were killed by illegal immigrants--and talks to Humphries. He's even louder than Larson, and lucky for Rubio he dispenses with amnesty quickly to ask if Democrats would go along with a plan that doesn't win them new voters. ""I can already hear the Democrats' argument,"" says Humphries. ""Taxation without representation! I want these people to vote! I want my Democrats in there!"" ""That's the law right now,"" says Rubio. There are no callers, no weird hypotheticals, no more banter. Rubio has gotten through the immigration bill's launch day and wrenched the discussion on the right past amnesty, over to his own terms."	How Marco Rubio Avoids the Amnesty Trap
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/04/marco_rubio_helping_to_pass_immigration_reform_if_the_florida_senator_helps.html	"If Marco Rubio helps pass comprehensive immigration reform, he will have accomplished more as a senator than Barack Obama did. Obama ran for president in 2008 claiming that he would bring people together and launch a new era of bipartisan cooperation, but as a senator he never actually did very much of that. If Rubio can help pull off this trick, he will have helped build a bipartisan deal on one of the most volatile and complex issues of our time. For a senator with national ambitions like Rubio, the cloakroom can be confining. Voters don't generally favor the senatorial talents for speech-making and deal-cutting like they once did. When Obama was considering whether he should run for president or stay in the Senate to get more seasoned, Sen. Ted Kennedy suggested he take the plunge before he got barnacled with lots of votes he'd have to explain. (Hillary Clinton's Senate vote on the Iraq war helped sink her in that same campaign.) Plus, if you're in a hurry to get your name at the front of the big bumper sticker, the Senate doesn't offer many opportunities. You can make a quiet difference or a big noise, but it's hard to do both. If you've been a governor, you can highlight your decision-making experience and the big things you did, but Rubio, like Obama, has no executive experience. Immigration reform offers Sen. Rubio a trap door out of the cloakroom. If legislation passes, he can take a share of the credit, but also claim that he demonstrated a key presidential skill: working in the system to make progress (assuming, of course, that the conventional wisdom is ultimately that the final immigration bill is progress). If Rubio can build on that success, he may even revive the senatorial pathway for others. It may, once again be true that a senator can elevate himself in the national conversation through accomplishments that are a little more sturdy than fine speech-making. It would be a wonderful thing because then politicians-in-a-hurry might actually compete to pass legislation that improves people's lives. Rubio is highlighting this skill in his television appearances. ""My job in the Senate is not just to give speeches and do interviews, it's to solve problems,"" he told Chris Wallace of Fox News. On Sunday, Rubio appeared on seven news shows, setting a new standard, but the most important pitch will be on CCTV in the conservative club house. Rubio's main task has been as an envoy to the Republican conservative wing. The Florida senator is a trusted voice on this issue because of his heritage, but also because of his conservative voting record and relationship with Tea Party activists. Rubio has a chance to sell Senate conservatives in a way that Sen. Lindsey Graham never could. That's because members know that Rubio can help give them cover in the wider conservative world in a way Graham can't. In this role, Rubio talks to conservatives but it also means speaking for them in negotiations with Democrats and Republican squishes. In the coming days, we'll see if Rubio is able to maintain that balance. He has already had to knock down false reports about free cellphones being given to illegal immigrants. In his debates with conservative luminaries, even if he hasn't emerged victorious, he's kept the relationship steady. ""I disagree with major parts of this bill,"" said talk show host Mark Levin, "" but you can't deny [Rubio] has integrity."" Rubio doesn't need to convince everyone; he simply needs to convince enough people to hold a deal together. Can he sell a new definition of amnesty, one of the most potent words in politics? Rubio argues that the bill is not amnesty because the pathway to citizenship is more onerous than it is under current law. Perhaps equally difficult will be convincing conservatives that the broader security requirements and enforcement mechanisms in the bill will stick when they are in the hands of bureaucrats who they don't trust and who have let them down before. ""He has been great at selling the summary [of the bill],"" says one veteran Senate staffer, ""now he's got to sell the [legislative] language."" In the Rand vs. Rubio competition to use the Senate as a national platform, showing that he can get something accomplished is how Rubio can distinguish himself. Sen. Ran Paul is exciting and a fierce advocate, but so was his father. This skill can fill a ballroom and light up Twitter, but it doesn't help getting laws passed or changing the ones that are already on the books. As President Obama has learned, speeches only take you so far. Of course, even if comprehensive immigration reform survives, one piece of legislation doesn't make a career. Plus, Rubio had advantages on this specific bill that aren't broadly transferable. His Cuban heritage made him the perfect salesperson for a party desperate to rebrand itself with Hispanic voters. (For this, Rubio can thank the president. Had Obama not trounced Mitt Romney so handily among Hispanic voters, Republicans may not have been as willing to put themselves in the hands of the young untested senator.)

There's going to be another Newtown shooting and those who blocked the bill will face an even greater public outcry. On a call arranged by the Democratic National Committee on Tuesday, pollster Geoff Garin offered a corollary to this point. ""If Republicans are betting that people don't care, they're betting that we have a placid situation in perpetuity and that sadly is not the case."" Newtown was not enough. On Wednesday, Democrats could not round up enough votes to overcome a Republican filibuster of a proposed compromise on background checks, which was the centerpiece of their legislation. The tragedy last December at Sandy Hook Elementary was supposed to tip conventional wisdom, which held that supporters of gun rights were more passionate and likely to hold their lawmakers accountable than supporters of gun control. In the end, the conventional wisdom held. Now gun control advocates like Michael Bloomberg will have a chance to make good on their threats to hold these legislators accountable in the next election. It may be even more difficult than getting a bill passed. President Obama, speaking in the Rose Garden after the vote, was visibly angry, saying that the gun lobby and its allies ""willfully lied"" about what was in the bill. He charged that a minority said it wasn't worth it to protect children's lives. New York mayor Michael Bloomberg responded to the outcome with a clear threat to both parties. ""Democrats--who are so quick to blame Republicans for our broken gun laws--could not stand united. And Republicans--who are so quick to blame Democrats for not being tough enough on crime--handed criminals a huge victory. ... The only silver lining is that we now know who refuses to stand with the 90 percent of Americans--and in 2014, our ever-expanding coalition of supporters will work to make sure that voters don't forget."" Gabby Giffords, the former congresswoman shot two years ago in an assassination attempt, reacted with the same message: ""It's clear to me that if members of the U.S. Senate refuse to change the laws to reduce gun violence, then we need to change the members of the U.S. Senate."" For those who would like to exact electoral revenge, the easiest targets would be the vulnerable Senate candidates up for re-election in 2014 who voted against gun control. There are three such candidates who voted against the background check amendment. They are all Democrats. That means, if Michael Bloomberg and other supporters of gun control want to exact punishment, they are likely to help Minority Leader Mitch McConnell get halfway to his goal of becoming Senate Majority Leader. It's a tough year to make electoral threats from the Democratic side. The five most vulnerable members in the Senate are the Democrats running in states that Barack Obama lost to Mitt Romney. Three of those candidates--Sen. Mark Begich of Alaska, Sen. Max Baucus of Montana, and Sen. Mark Pryor of Arkansas--voted with Republicans to help kill the background check measure. (Two other candidates who find themselves in this position--Sen. Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana--voted to support the compromise hammered out by Sens. Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey.) All five of these Democrats voted with Republicans in the failed attempt to beat the filibuster against an alternative bill put forward by Republican senators. That measure--which would have expanded Second Amendment rights while making it hard for the mentally ill to get firearms--increased funding for prosecutions and cracked down on gun trafficking. Gun control advocates disliked the bill. Will they work against all five Democrats, or spare the two who voted to help the background check bill? In his remarks, President Obama only called out the Democrats who voted against the background check for condemnation--that also included North Dakota freshman Sen. Heidi Heitkamp. And boy did he call them out, calling them essentially cowardly for caving to political pressure. ""All in all this was a pretty shameful day for Washington,"" said the president. The four next most vulnerable seats in the Senate are all held by Democrats who are retiring. Whoever runs in those races can't be targeted by gun control advocates because they have never cast a Senate vote. The most electorally threatened Republican is Maine's Sen. Susan Collins, who along with three other Republicans, voted for the Manchin-Toomey compromise. The rest of the Republicans up for re-election in 2014 face electorates more likely to praise them for protecting the Second Amendment than punish them for thwarting gun control, which is why all of them voted to kill Wednesday's gun bill. The test for gun control proponents is to prove that their grass-roots supporters are as single-issue focused as the gun rights crowd. That's a harder task when control of the Senate is at stake. Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell needs only six seats to take Sen. Harry Reid's job. A voter who wants to punish a Democrat for his votes on gun measures will have to weigh how much they want to help Mitch McConnell in the process. Of all the Senate Democrats likely to be targeted by Bloomberg and his allies, Sen. Mark Pryor may be in the toughest spot. He only has a C- rating with the NRA, which means the organization would be happy to see him go. For Pryor, the vote merely helps him avoid more problems than he already has with conservative voters. ""Sometimes you vote just to limit your pain,"" says one Senate veteran evaluating Pryor's predicament. Now Pryor will have to wait and see how much gun control advocates will be able to make good on their threats to mobilize black voters against him. While Democratic strategists concede that it will be hard to punish individual senators, they do predict further erosion for Republicans nationally. In a recent Washington Post poll, only 23 percent of Americans believe that the Republican party is ""in touch with the concerns of most people in the United States today."" (Fifty-one percent say Obama is and 43 percent say Democrats are). That brand problem is worsened when Republicans vote against measures that have broad popular support. Polls consistently show that a vast majority of the country supports background checks for those gun sales in which background checks are not already required by law. Though Republicans will rightly point to the Democrats who voted against their own party and president, the popular perception that Republicans stood on the opposite side of a majority view is irrefutable. After the votes Wednesday, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said the vote was a ""delay and not a defeat."" If that's true, will it be the next election or the next massacre that does it? Read more on Slate about gun control."	Will It Take Another Massacre or Another Election for Gun Control to Win?
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/04/boston_marathon_bombing_washington_speculates_on_the_meaning.html	"When a man-made disaster strikes any other city, Washington holds its breath. On Tuesday, the pedestrian stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House had been cleared and cordoned off from tourists. Metro stations received more noticeable visits from cops and police dogs. On the walk into the Capitol, trash cans--two of those were used to conceal timed explosives at locations of the Boston Marathon--were turned on their sides, empty and harmless, like Brutalist bird-feeders. But Congress was one whole tragedy behind. Victims and survivors of gun violence were still on the Hill, lobbying for cloture on a much-diluted gun control bill. Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who's become a uniquely powerful advocate for universal background checks, was ushered up to the Democrats' lunch by her husband Mark Kelly and bill sponsor Sen. Joe Manchin, slogging through platoons of reporters and TV cameras. Members of Congress knew what to say about Newtown. They didn't quite know how to talk about Boston. ""Whenever we have an attack like this it's difficult not to think that it's somehow involved in Islamic extremism,"" said Maine Sen. Susan Collins, until recently a top member of the Homeland Security committee and still a prime mover on security bills. ""I don't have evidence to back that up. That's just based on previous attacks."" Collins, more than some senators, was willing to tease out the hypothetical. ""It's a very important question, whether it's a plot that originated overseas or whether it's a lone wolf,"" she said. ""The question is: What do we do once we do capture the individual? How's he treated? If he's an American, obviously, then the constitutional protections pertain. If he is a foreign national, in my view, then he should be held by a military tribunal and he should not be read his Miranda rights as [the Christmas Day Bomber] was."" The people who think Washington pivots from tragedy to legislative ""solutions"" aren't paranoid. They've got proof. After 9/11, Congress rushed through a PATRIOT Act that contained provisions previous Congresses had nixed. After Newtown, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein confirmed she was ready to introduce a new assault weapons ban, which sent National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierre into his usual level of apoplexy. ""She has had her gun ban legislation in her desk for over a year--waiting for the right time to introduce it,"" he said. ""Really? Waiting for an unspeakable act to occur so the American people could be persuaded to buy into her political agenda?"" Boston is different. No one but the perpetrator knows who's responsible. In the morning and afternoon, senators with access to intelligence briefings sought information, but couldn't say what cities or security forces needed to do to prevent attacks. ""The FBI and DHS are investigating this as a terrorist attack,"" said Delaware Sen. Tom Carper, a member of the Homeland Security committee. ""It's not clear whether it is, whether it's an attack launched domestically, or outside our country."" As an aide politely passed on a Fox News interview--the network's camera crew was lying in wait for senators--Carper talked about the wisdom imparted on Amtrak journeys between D.C. and Wilmington. ""One of our adages on the train is: If you see something, say something. That's an adage we should embrace."" Republicans put that sentiment a little differently. ""On 9/11, we were forever disabused of the notion that attacks like the one that rocked Boston yesterday only happen on the field of battle, or in distant countries,"" said Sen. Mitch McConnell in his morning floor speech. ""With the passage of time, however, and the vigilant efforts of our military, intelligence, and law enforcement professionals, I think it's safe to say that, for many, the complacency that prevailed prior to Sept. 11 has returned."" Security hawks have some ideas about arresting that ""complacency."" New York Rep. Peter King, one of the first members of Congress to speak to national media after the bombings in Boston, told MSNBC that it was ""foolhardy"" to make cuts to the Department of Homeland Security's budget. ""I do think we need more cameras,"" he said. ""We have to stay ahead of the terrorists and I do know in New York, the Lower Manhattan Security Initiative, which is based on cameras, the outstanding work that results from that."" That would mean money, but a new focus on security could mean more than funding. The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1994 has been amended before, in the wake of threats, to require ""back doors"" for law enforcement to monitor or access new technologies. A new or amended CALEA could make those requests of programs like Skype; it could set rules for when and how police can review bulk cell-tower records. At a briefing with reporters, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer led off with remarks on Boston and added that it was ""interesting that this week we are considering, as you know, cyber security legislation."" What else could get a second glance as law enforcement looks at Boston? Both Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham, cohorts in the ""Gang of Eight"" working out an immigration bill, suggested that their bill might look even more necessary if--as we know, we don't know--the culprit in Boston was a foreign national. ""It may be an argument for the kind of things we're talking about,"" McCain said. ""Exit-entry visas, e-verify. In fact, I think it should accelerate [the bill]."" McCain, accidentally and by long distance, was debating Iowa Rep. Steve King. He'd suggested to National Review that the Boston attacks should move Congress from debating immigration to debating security. ""We need to take a look at the visa-waiver program and wonder what we're doing,"" he'd said. ""If we can't background-check people that are coming from Saudi Arabia, how do we think we are going to background check the 11 to 20 million people that are here from who knows where?"" That was another debate, to be held some other day. At 3 p.m., Giffords and her husband joined the family of Gabriel Zimmerman for their only public event of the day. Zimmerman, a staffer who had been murdered by the Tucson gunman who had shot Giffords, was being honored; a room on the Hill was being renamed in his honor. Seated at the front of the room were political rivals who were on the verge of either passing or filibustering the gun bill Giffords wanted. Vice President Joe Biden took the opportunity to preview the next agonizing, paranoia-feeding response to a tragedy. ""We will find out what happened,"" he said. ""We will bring them to justice. We will come out of what's happened in Boston stronger."" Read more on Slate about the Boston Marathon bombing."	How Washington Interprets a Tragedy
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/04/senate_votes_for_cloture_on_gun_bill_democrats_are_ready_to_declare_any.html	"Lori Haas nearly got kicked out of the Senate viewing gallery. The upper house was voting on whether or not to allow a debate on gun legislation. Haas' freshman senator, Tim Kaine, spotted her from the floor. He waved up. She waved back. That nearly violated the churchlike protocols of the Senate. But Haas negotiated with Capitol security to keep her seat and count out the votes, on her fingers, occasionally pumping her fist when a surprise Republican ""aye"" came through, stopping only when the vote came in--68-31 for cloture. ""I was counting all the yes votes,' "" she said, after she and fellow gun-bill advocates left the gallery. ""I knew they'd gotten to 60, but I was afraid I'd counted wrong. I didn't want to get that wrong. This is very emotional for me. I've been working on this for six years."" Six years ago, a Virginia Tech student who should have failed a background check turned two semi-automatic pistols on a classroom, killing 32 and injuring 17. Haas' daughter, Emily, was one of the 17; she took two bullets to the head and wondered whether she'd bleed out. Her mother became a full-time gun control campaigner. Like the other activists in the Senate Thursday--some of them Newtown family members who wept as senators spoke--she was calling the cloture vote a win. For gun-bill advocates, from the White House on down, any bill is a win. They haven't actually seen the bill they're celebrating now; Sen. Joe Manchin and Sen. Pat Toomey have only released a fact sheet before they introduce their compromise amendment. They know that this bill will chuck multiple brass-ring priorities recommended this year by the White House's task force. No assault weapons ban, no ban on extended magazines. Just a background checks plan that was, until yesterday, being worked on in consultation with the NRA itself. That doesn't matter to the advocates. At a press conference before the cloture vote, flanked by family members of those wounded or murdered in gun massacres--again, with some of them weeping openly--Sen. Chuck Schumer imagined a world in which the NRA was reeling. ""With the vote that we take today,"" he said, ""we are turning the page against the NRA's dominance."" He was so dedicated to the long game that he'd even skipped another press conference, after Toomey fretted about the optics of appearing with the NRA's New York bete noir. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was saying the exact same thing, only louder and with more snark. ""The NRA's real thing was to stop anything,"" he said. ""And once we have some sensible gun laws, and once elected officials understand they don't have to kowtow to the N.R.A., that the public has a voice here, and the public wants to be heard, and the public is going to vote in the next election whenever anybody is running, based on whether people were rational on this and tried to save their lives, that's what matters here."" If it all sounds theoretical, that's because it is. Democrats haven't moved a gun bill in two decades, preferring (or being forced into) an accommodation with the NRA and the rest of the gun lobby. But what's happened to the NRA? They think it's been brought lower--it's got a modest plus-7 favorable rating in the last relevant poll--by its bridge-burning approach to the gun debate. So Democrats are adopting Saul Alinsky's 13th rule, to ""freeze"" and ""personalize"" and ""polarize"" a target, although the NRA has done some of the freezing all by itself. Before today's vote, a Democratic aide told me that the party had run the numbers on the Senate races targeted by the NRA in 2012. In 13 out of 16 races, the NRA lost. It accused Barack Obama of harboring a ""secret plan to destroy the Second Amendment,"" and then lost to him. Twice. In Virginia, even. To really whip the gun lobby, Democrats need the other team to abandon all sense of strategy and tact. They know that happened this week, as a ballyhooed filibuster of the motion to proceed fell to pieces. There was no filibuster; Sen. Ted Cruz, one of the Republicans who'd called for it, stood awkwardly on the Senate floor as Reid warned against any senator trying to ""spoil"" things by filibustering amendments. But there are so many ways to sink a gun bill. Sen. Schumer fretted that concealed carry reciprocity--the right for someone with a permit in one state to carry in another--could make it into the gun bill as a ""pernicious"" amendment. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who voted for cloture, is ready with an amendment that would loosen the rules keeping guns away from people adjudicated ""mentally ill."" Alaska Sen. Mark Begich, one of two Democrats who opposed cloture, has signed onto the Graham bill. As they left the cloture vote, the Republicans who'd gone ""aye"" refused to commit to the next votes. ""Harry Reid has told us that we will have the opportunity to offer amendments to this bill,"" said Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who's frequently backed an assault weapons ban. ""Voting to proceed to that attracted the support of Democrats and Republicans, but it is not in any way a predictor of the vote on final passage or the vote on any of the amendments."" The NRA has helpfully described the amendments it wants. In a letter sent to senators last night, Chris Cox (whose proper mouthful title is ""NRA Institute for Legislative Action Executive Director) asked for amendments that would ""fix our broken mental health system [i.e. Begich-Graham], increase prosecutions of violent criminals; and make our schools safer [i.e. armed guards, like Wayne LaPierre keeps saying]."" If anything else made it in, ""the NRA will make an exception to our standard policy of not 'scoring' procedural votes and strongly oppose a cloture motion to move to final passage."" That threat blindsided some senators. Sens. Manchin and Toomey had been under the impression that their compromise, with all of its exemptions for person-to-person gun sales, could satisfy the NRA. On Thursday, some Republicans were still unaware of the NRA's key-vote message. They have ultra-specific concerns about the gun bill. Democrats have only one: Whatever it is, pass it."	Why Democrats Are Ready to Declare Any Gun Bill a Victory
26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/04/rand_paul_speaks_at_howard_university_the_libertarian_presidential_hopeful.html	"It was all going fine until Rand Paul got stuck on a name. The Kentucky senator had just finished a 20-minute speech at Howard University, the 167-year-old historically black college in northwest Washington, D.C. He'd survived the inevitable civic demonstration, when Brian Menifee, a mechanical engineering senior, tried to unfurl a red and black and green banner reading ""Howard University Doesn't Support White Supremacy."" Menifee, wearing dreadlocks and a He-Man and the Masters of the Universe T-shirt, was yanked out of the room by security as the senator looked on and the audience applauded. ""You know, I wasn't sure if my speech would be entertaining,"" joked Paul. That got a laugh. Paul got through his remarks, all about how ""when the time is right, I hope that African-Americans will again look to the party of emancipation, civil liberty, and individual freedom."" Students ran to the microphones, the queues for questions spilling into the aisles of the auditorium. But the third question sounded like a gimme. ""Are we discussing the 19th-century Republican Party,"" asked Howard junior Immanuel Lewis, ""or are we discussing the post-1968 Republican Party of Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan? My question for you is: Which one do you identify with?"" Exactly what Paul had come to discuss. ""We see horrible Jim Crow and horrible racism in the '30s, '40s, '50s--it was all Democrats,"" he said. ""It wasn't Republicans. Now, did some of them switch over and become Republicans? Yes."" Then he searched his memory. ""One of the African-American U.S. senators was a guy named, uh--I'm blanking on his name--from Massachusetts."" Students started shouting the answer. Brooke! Edward Brooke! He was a graduate of Howard, after all. ""Brooks!"" said Paul. ""Edwin Brooks!"" Laughter burbled out of the audience, barely suppressed, as Paul quoted Brooke on how Republicans simply needed to talk more about their accomplishments. ""How many of you--if I'd said, who do you think the founders of the NAACP are,"" asked Paul, ""do you think they were Democrats or Republicans, would everybody here know they were all Republicans?"" More shouting, more laughter. Yes! Every Howard student is required to ""satisfy an African-American course requirement."" Of course they knew this. ""I don't mean that to be insulting,"" said Paul. ""I don't know what you know. I mean, I'm trying to find out what the connection is."" The tension cooled, but it never fully thawed. Rand Paul possesses a monk's confidence in his ability to convert skeptics with his words. He makes alliances more easily than some Republicans, finding the libertarian common ground with Democrats on drones, drug policy, or the ongoing war in Afghanistan. His 13-hour filibuster of CIA Director John Brennan's nomination was a genuine sensation, and it moved public opinion. He followed it up with a Spanglish speech about immigration reform. Outreach to black voters? Anything's possible for the Hayek Whisperer. And Paul was trying to perfect a triple-axel that other Republicans had tried and failed to perform. The post-election Republican visit to Howard is nearly a tradition. Then-RNC Chairman Ken Mehlman did it in 2005. ""If the party of Lincoln does not have more African-Americans come back home,"" said Mehlman, ""then we can't call ourselves a real majority."" Then-RNC Chairman Michael Steele did it in 2009, with a more buddy-buddy approach. ""A lot of folks thought I was gonna come up into this institution and convert all of y'all to become Republicans,"" he said. ""That is a bone-headed idea."" Well, that was his opinion. Paul was beaten to Wednesday morning's speech by a team of Young Americans for Liberty volunteers, wearing ""Stand With Rand"" stickers, trying to get names for the senator's mailing list. When the senator arrived, he paid tribute to his cojones. ""When I think of how political enemies often twist and distort my positions,"" he said, ""I think [of T.S.] Eliot's words: 'When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall, how should I presume?' And here I am today at Howard, a historically black college. Here I am, a guy who once presumed to discuss a section of the Civil Rights Act."" In 2010, Paul had made a spirited, libertarian critique of the Act's implementation, was swiftly accused of racism, and forever changed the way he talks about these things. On Wednesday morning, he was talking past the audience. To a viewer at home--a Fox News viewer, maybe--it was enough that Paul was there and a bonus that he got heckled. ""Republicans do, indeed, still believe many rights remain with the people and states respectively,"" said Paul. ""When some people hear that, they tune us out and say: He's just using code words for the state's right to discriminate, for the state's right to segregate and abuse. But that's simply not true. Many Republicans do believe that decentralization of power is the best policy, that government is more efficient, more just, and more personal when it is smaller and more local."" Republicans don't understand why this message fails to grip black voters. It didn't grip the crowd at Howard. Heckler aside, the room sat silent as Paul expounded on the Democrats' pre-1964 record on race, from one obscure bigot to another. No one applauded until Paul got to some actual policy. ""I am working with Democratic senators to make sure that kids who make bad decisions such as nonviolent possession of drugs are not imprisoned for lengthy sentences,"" said Paul. ""I am working to make sure that first time offenders are put into counseling and not imprisoned with hardened criminals."" Barack Obama and George Bush did drugs, after all, and they turned out okay because they got ""lucky."" Paul was on to something, but it didn't last. ""Some argue with evidence that our drug laws are biased--that they are the new Jim Crow,"" he said. ""But to simply be against them for that reason misses a larger point. They are unfair to everyone."" Why'd Paul go there? ""I think everyone in this room has read The New Jim Crow,"" said Evan Rogers, a sophomore. The 2012 book by Michelle Alexander argued that a ""colorblind consensus"" had created a new caste system, with countless African-Americans ruined for life after committing minor felonies. ""As a criminal,"" she wrote, ""you have scarcely more rights, and arguably less respect, than a black man living in Alabama at the height of Jim Crow."" And here Paul, who wields hyperbole like a pro to campaign against spy drones, was telling people to stop invoking Jim Crow. Paul told one student who fretted about Republican voter ID bills that he ""demean[ed] the horror"" of poll tests. But this was savvy. When he left the campus, past the students still holding the ""White Supremacy"" banner and conducting interviews, Paul remained the Republican most likely to reform mandatory minimums. He remained the most prominent Republican supporter of drug law reform. He wouldn't apologize for the Republican Party, or for libertarianism, or for that 2010 interview about the Civil Rights Act. ""Should we limit speech from people we find abhorrent?"" he said then. ""Should we limit racists from speaking?"" Now, he was offering African-Americans some accommodation, from time to time. ""I think he's the best chance we have to win in 2016,"" said Michael Davis, a 1979 graduate of Howard's law school and current Republican activist. He'd delayed a trip to the RNC's annual meeting in order to see Paul--""this was more important."" He did so even though he disagreed completely with Paul on civil rights. Businesses weren't as ""enlightened"" as Paul wished them to be. ""But, you know, I traveled to Europe with Dan Quayle,"" said Davis. ""I think about the bad rap he got over 'potatoe.' He never shook that. But other politicians have made these kinds of errors and they've thrived."""	Why Rand Paul Thinks Blacks Should Blame Democrats for Jim Crow
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/04/senate_considers_a_gun_bill_democrats_welcome_republicans_threatening_a.html	"Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt wrapped up at the Republican leadership press conference--the typical, news-challenged Recitation of the Talking Points--and walked into a wall of reporters. Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell had signed on to a pre-emptive filibuster of any gun bill. Would Blunt join him? ""I think it's better to debate these issues and vote on 'em,"" said Blunt. ""But I'll decide, as everybody else will, what they're gonna do on that when there's a for-certain bill with the ability to offer amendments."" Maybe they didn't need to block a vote on the bill right away. ""We always have the 60-vote standard on whether to go to a final vote or not."" In 2010, Blunt easily won a Senate race in a state that's getting redder. He has an A rating from the National Rifle Association. Wayne LaPierre actually campaigned for him that year, headlining one of the events on Blunt's ""Second Amendment Tour."" And so reporters kept following Blunt to make sure they hadn't dreamt these quotes. ""I missed the first part of that,"" asked one reporter. ""You believe we should allow this gun legislation to proceed to debate?"" ""Oh, I don't think I said that,"" said Blunt. ""I said I'll be anxious to see what the actual gun legislation looks like when Sen. Reid brings it to the floor. But as a general principle, it's better to debate the bill."" That didn't quite end it. Blunt was asked whether his colleagues--like McConnell, the leader in the Senate--were wise to threaten a filibuster. ""Let's see if they can truly argue that Republicans weren't able to propose any alternatives,"" he said. Another reporter arrived and inserted her recording device into the scrum. ""I wanted to ask you,"" she said, ""and you may have addressed this already, whether you support the filibuster?"" Not a feeding frenzy, but close to it. As Blunt patiently answered the questions, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was announcing that he'd seek cloture on gun control legislation. Not even 24 hours had passed since reporters were tut-tutting about President Obama's ""last ditch"" push for gun control. Was everybody wrong? Was the bill going to pass? Yes and no. Yes, the consensus idea that the gun debate was over, that Obama had blown it by not moving faster, was strange and hasty. Nine times out of 10 it's safe to assume that Congress won't pass a bill. It's Congress! But the ""gun safety"" lobby (best to scare-quote the term, as it's a media-tested replacement for ""gun control"") had said for months that it would accept a gun bill far, far reduced from the recommendations of the White House's task force. Gabrielle Giffords and Mark Kelly's own gun control activism was focused on passing universal background checks. The families of Newtown massacre victims, in Washington, D.C. this week for another round of tear-jerking and lobbying, have focused their campaign on a vote, period, not on any specific bill. The Republican Party in the Senate isn't built for nuance like that. Their struggles began on March 22, when Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, Utah Sen. Mike Lee, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz released an open letter to Reid promising to ""oppose the motion to proceed to any legislation that will serve as a vehicle for any additional gun restrictions."" That quickly turned into flypaper for Republicans who wanted to make a pre-emptive pro-freedom-and-America stand. And this was covered as ""momentum building for a filibuster."" We've been trapped in this Wonderland of spin before. In February, opponents of defense nominee Chuck Hagel promised to filibuster his nomination. Ted Cruz wrote a letter; they signed onto it. They had the votes to delay Hagel with one filibuster, but over the next congressional recess, as damaging Hagel intel failed to emerge, the 41-senator squad fell apart. The hardcore Hagel foes revealed how weak they were with another letter, asking the president to withdraw the nomination. That only got 14 signatures. You either have 41, or you don't have a filibuster. The White House won. So the Senate lurched on to the gun bill--and conservatives tried the exact same strategy. The White House's gun bill push has never been about a must-have provision. Like the 2009 push for health care reform or the 2010 Dodd-Frank offensive, it's been about getting something done and letting the Senate Democrats figure out the ""something."" If the final gun bill looks like the compromise being put together by Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey and West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, well, sure, fine. Obama's new tribute to gun violence victims isn't ""they deserve an assault weapons ban."" It's ""they deserve a vote."" How better to prove that, and to get the discussion away from the details that were weakening the background checks push, then another fight with the Senate conservatives? This frustrated the Senate's more experienced Republicans. A filibuster draws attention to a cause when it's done well. But if you're serious about killing a bill, you can debate it and attach a ""poison pill"" amendment--a tactic that sunk the post-Columbine gun bills of 1999. That could still happen this year. First, Republicans had to explain (and explain and explain) their filibuster stances. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker wasn't on board with the filibuster. ""This is one senator who likes to read a bill before I make a decision about what I'm gonna do,"" he said. ""What's the bill? It could be a negotiated agreement between Manchin and Toomey. I saw them on the floor for a few moments and wished them well."" South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham didn't want to block a vote, either. ""As long as we get amendments, I want to proceed to the bill,"" he said. ""I think we should be allowed to amend it. I'm not afraid of this debate. I want this debate."" Even Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who'd signed the filibuster letter, opened up room to allow a vote. ""It was an easy letter to sign, because I took an oath to defend the Constitution,"" he told reporters. ""I try to be pretty flexible. The letter was about any bill that would restrict Second Amendment rights."" By late afternoon Democrats had heard as many as 10 Republicans buck the filibuster, on the record. If those senators were serious, a few red state Democrats, like Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor, would be free to cast ""no's"" and then cut re-election ads. Reid wouldn't say he had the votes to win, but neither would Cruz. ""That will be up to the members of the Senate,"" Cruz said to a throng of reporters outside a Capitol Hill elevator. ""In my view every senator has a responsibility to actively protect the bill of rights. Any bill that would undermine the bill of rights should, in my opinion, be subject to a 60-vote threshold."" Cruz kept talking, asking the press to focus on things like ""the prosecution priorities of the Obama Justice Department"" instead of the gun bill du jour. He talked, and Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, walked pass the press corps, generally unnoticed, which isn't a bad thing to be if you think you're going to win."	Why Democrats Smile When Republicans Threaten Them With Filibusters

That will change next week when Congress returns from spring break. Immigration reform, gun control legislation, and a big budget deal are all on the agenda. Gridlock is going to turn into Cannonball Run--high-stakes, high-speed, and full of oddball characters taking the lead. There may be an extravagant pile-up, but the spring and summer offer a change from the cramped fussiness of going from one budget crisis to the next. If nothing else, the legislative process in Washington is going to get a lot more interesting. ""We don't do comprehensive well,"" Sen. Lamar Alexander said three years ago during the health care reform debate. He was right. Congress isn't good at handling complex and volatile issues through its regular procedures. Controversial budget measures pass with bipartisan agreement only after last-minute crisis negotiations. Legislation on national issues advances only on essentially party-line votes. Health care reform received no Republican support. Financial reform passed in 2010 with three Republicans in the Senate and the Houseand the 2009 stimulus passed with three Senate Republicans and no GOP support in the House. Now Congress faces three highly charged pieces of comprehensive legislation. The road to redemption usually requires taking one small step at a time, but the political establishment could take a huge bound. If lawmakers can come to an agreement on even one of these big issues, it will offer evidence that Washington politicians can not only perform the basic functions of their office, but that they can do so when it comes to complicated and politically sensitive issues. Congress has passed big measures like the national defense authorization or patent reform (seven years in the making), but these issues are different. Those pieces of legislation didn't touch on emotionally charged national issues. Other than abortion rights, it's hard to think of a more emotional issue than gun control. Second Amendment supporters are notoriously passionate and the issue has been supercharged by the recent shootings and the president's regular involvement. Immigration reform is emotional, but its gargantuan size comes from the scope of its effect on the economy and the 11 million people who are in the United States illegally and whose lives will be immediately affected. The battle over the budget--and the possibility of a grand bargain--touch on all facets of the federal government. Politically, the argument over the budget also represents the core issue that was debated in the last election. That these are national issues is demonstrated by the cast of characters looking to make a name for themselves by rushing into the action. If nothing else, hearing about Sens. Schumer, Manchin, Cruz, Rubio, and Paul is a refreshing break from all the coverage of Obama, Boehner, Cantor and McConnell. There is activity on all three issues--not all of it in a positive direction--but unlike the grinding slowness of the last few years, at least there is ferment and activity. (One veteran journalist compared covering the dreary sameness of Washington budget battles to reporting on the decades-long stalemate between the Israelis and Palestinians.) On immigration, the Gang of Eight may rescue the reputation and good name of Washington gangs. Unlike the supercommittee or the Gang of Six working on health care in 2009 or the Gang of Six working on the budget in 2011, this group has not collapsed and may produce actual legislative language. On the budget, the president, House, and Senate will all put out documents. A conference committee to reconcile the differences is likely to take place. Hearings will be held and ideas will be debated. The president is holding another dinner with Republican senators next Wednesday as he continues to try to find some road to a grand bargain. The destination is a long way off but at least people have stopped screaming at one another in the street and have gotten back into their cars. Legislation on sweeping gun control measures may not pass, but the momentum for a vote is enormous. One of the frustrating things about Washington gridlock is the lack of accountability for being so utterly awful. On the question of gun control, voters will be able to see how their lawmakers voted. It's hard to imagine that it will evaporate the way cap-and-trade legislation did in Obama's first term or immigration reform, energy reform, or Social Security reform did during the Bush years. There are plenty of reasons these three big pieces of legislation could collapse. The forces of partisanship, ego, and limited imagination that have made crisis budgeting so dreary to watch and so disappointing substantively are still very much alive. But we have just come from a fight over budget sequestration where the two sides could not come to an agreement to avoid cuts designed to be so draconian they would force agreement. So after a period of desolation, a few green shoots are welcome. The two parties have not even been in proximity of a major bipartisan deal in so long the very fact that they are in the same neighborhood is a possible sign that our system is not irreparably broken. Spring is a time of renewal. Perhaps that can be true in Washington, too. If not, at least it will give us something far more interesting to watch.

Why Washington May Be Ready to Redeem Itself
29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/04/david_stockman_s_return_the_former_reagan_budget_director_gets_media_attention.html	"Thirty-one years and six-odd months. That's the new record. That's how long former Reagan budget director David Stockman has dined out on his outcast/iconoclast--outconoclast?--reputation for fiscal straight talk. Reporters would have a tough time shaming parties or presidents if the occasional Isaiah didn't break away and do the shaming for them. Stockman's been shaming Republicans since his breakfasts with William Greider turned into a novella-length Atlantic blockbuster about his political ""education."" Stockman hung up his green eyeshade and spent two decades in the private sector. But for media purposes, he is forever a ""former Reagan budget director"" who ""warns of new housing bubble"" or ""wouldn't touch the stock market with a 100-foot pole"" or ""blasts Paul Ryan's proposal."" The bio sells the story and confirms whatever economic theory is being plied. That's a shame: Stockman's current theory is one part sense and five parts Hunger Games nightmare. In his view the gold standard should be restored, entitlements should be abolished, and a brief crash would be followed by a somewhat prosperous dawn. This was former Rep. Ron Paul's plan for years, but the media takes it more seriously when it comes from someone like Stockman. Ever since that Atlantic piece and especially since his own 1986 memoir The Triumph of Politics, Stockman's been a living monument to truth in politics--a terra-cotta warrior of centrism who was ""taken to the woodshed"" and survived. It's easy to forget, but he spent three more years in the White House after the Atlantic profile allegedly ruined him. And he got $2.4 million for the memoir, but that remains a strong read. Stockman. The point of Greider's profile was that supply-side economics didn't really work. Stockman arrived at the Office of Management and Budget and, in Greider's words, ""discarded orthodox premises of how the economy would behave."" Cut taxes and cut spending and investors would feel new confidence. ""Instead of the continuing pattern of slow economic growth, the new model was based on a dramatic surge in the nation's productivity."" But it didn't happen, and the economy lurched deeper into recession, and the Laffer curve--the theory that more tax cuts always pumped more revenue--was disproven. That's how we remember Stockman's education. In his memoir, he had more time to explain the problem: There hadn't been enough cuts. ""That the politics of American democracy made a shambles of my anti-welfare state theory,"" he wrote, ""I can now understand."" Inflation was whipped, over a few long, painful years by a ""tight money"" (less printing of it, basically) policy from the Federal Reserve. That was fine by Stockman only because it was ""the nearest proxy for gold on the horizon."" And even the gold standard ""was not a magic cure for our problems, and was certainly no substitute for political discipline and fiscal solvency."" You needed to combine that with the partial abolition of the state. Stockman wrote this and then--as far as Washington was concerned--disappeared. He took his own advice, avoided the rent-seeking harems of K Street, and re-entered the private sector. That did not end well. Stockman started a private equity firm and became CEO of Collins & Aikman Corporation, an auto parts manufacturer in his native Michigan. He cut 750 management jobs from the manufacturer, betting that the manufacturing industry was about to take off. It didn't take off. In 2005, the company collapsed, and in 2007 the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Stockman of defrauding investors with schemes like phony letters ""that purported to justify the immediate recognition of rebates in income."" The case was settled in April 2010, when Stockman paid $7.2 million in fines. In the meantime, Stockman had published the first of a series of New York Times op-ed columns. He'd identified the real villains in our current crisis. ""The baleful reality,"" he wrote, ""is that the big banks, the freakish offspring of the Fed's easy money, are dangerous institutions, deeply embedded in a bull market culture of entitlement and greed."" A few months later, he was smartly repacking this message as a call for Republican sanity. ""It's a pity,"" he wrote, ""that the modern Republican Party offers the American people an irrelevant platform of recycled Keynesianism when the old approach --balanced budgets, sound money and financial discipline--is needed more than ever."" Liberals started to cite him, without seeming to realize that his problem with Paul Ryan was that he wasn't right-wing enough. A few columns later, truth-speaker reputation restored like a vintage Thunderbird, we have The Great Deformation. It's 748 pages long, at least 40 percent bigger than anything Washingtonians pretend to read, so most people will end up encountering it through Stockman's columns or public speeches. He still gives a good quote. At a Reuters-sponsored forum with his Obama-era counterpart Peter Orszag, Stockman claimed that the people who didn't see the failures of the economic system were afflicted by a ""recency bias,"" and that ""both parties function as concierges to introduce the politicians to K Street."" He would put a stop to that. Sort of like Bob Kerrey, who ran a buzzy but totally unsuccessful 2012 bid for Senate, Stockman wants an ""omnibus amendment"" that would abolish the Electoral College (OK); set single terms for all federal officeholders, including the president, at six years (hang on); run campaigns on public funds; and limit campaign time to two months. Like Charles Murray, he wants social welfare reverse-engineered so that ""all existing programs including housing, food stamps, and Medicare and Medicaid would be converted to cash equivalents."" And then there are the bold ideas: A 30 percent tax on wealth, eliminating most of the Federal Reserve in order to return to the ""gold-backed dollar,"" and the abolition of health insurance. ""The one necessary concession to socialism,"" he writes, ""would be a system of federally licensed catastrophic insurance funds."" I'd read this book 10 times before I read another possible presidential candidate's memoir of how his Real American Story schooled him in the Audacity of Hope. Like the Washington Post's Federal Reserve reporter Neil Irwin puts it, Stockman's ideal would mean ""forcing millions of Americans to endure grinding poverty because gold is good."" But it's a coherent vision of a World Without the Fed. In the 1980s, Stockman sardonically referred to a gap in the budget as the ""magical asterisk,"" something skeptics could figure out later. And now, against evidence, he says we've run out of later."	Why Does Anyone Still Listen to David Stockman?
