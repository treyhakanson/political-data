Stanley McChrystal, his top Afghanistan commander, some wondered whether the president really believed in the underlying counterinsurgency strategy that McChrystal was pursuing. Those questions were answered emphatically when Obama picked Gen. David Petraeus, who co-authored the manual outlining the strategy. The president has done a similar thing naming William Daley as his chief of staff. Anyone who wondered whether the pragmatic Obama of the lame duck session--willing to take a deal rather than have an ideological fight--would continue in the new year has gotten their answer. In a December 2009 op-ed for the Washington Post, Daley wrote that top Democrats need to ""acknowledge that the agenda of the party's most liberal supporters has not won the support of a majority of Americans--and, based on that recognition, to steer a more moderate course on the key issues of the day, from health care to the economy to the environment to Afghanistan."" In his new job, Daley will decide who gets to see the president and whose ideas he sees. Obama still runs the show, but he wouldn't have picked a chief of staff who held those views if he didn't also share them. (For a view on Obama's governing strategy, return to his last answer at the press conference, in which he announced his deal with GOP leaders for extending the Bush era tax cuts.) ""He is more pragmatic than people think,"" said a senior white House official. Speaking about Daley, another top official said: ""He shares the president's values and goals but is open about how you get there."" Daley will present that view to the public. He will be a spokesman for the administration that is losing two of its voices in adviser David Axelrod and Press Secretary Robert Gibbs. On the inside, administration officials say Daley will work to improve ties with business.  Not only has he been a banker for JPMorgan for the last seven years, working with CEOs and large companies, he also worked that account when he was commerce secretary in the Clinton administration. He also sits on the boards of Boeing and Abbott Laboratories. * The Chamber of Commerce put out a statement heralding Daley's appointment. Union leaders did not. Daley also knows how campaigns work. You may remember him from election night 2000, when he announced that Al Gore would not be conceding. He was chairman of Gore's campaign. That, too, will be an important business connection, because the Obama administration wants improved relations with the business community not only to help the U.S. economy but also to help the president's re-election chances. In the 2008 cycle, Democrats received 70 percent of the donations from Wall Street. In the last election cycle, as Andrew Ross Sorkin reported in the New York Times, that ratio flipped. Obama will announce Friday that Gene Sperling will head his National Economic Council. Sperling was an indefatigable part of the Clinton team that battled with the Gingrich-led Congress in the mid-'90s but also made deals with it. Obama's White House 2.0 is not being staffed to stage flamboyant ideological displays. The president is bringing on staffers to fight a war with a new set of rules.

On a party-line vote, the House approved a rules package that cuts government spending from today to the day that Republicans pass a budget. Those cuts are based on recommendations from Budget Chairman Paul Ryan--it's up to him to set the budget ceilings, which has some Democrats trying to irritate the Tea Party by calling Ryan the ""budget czar."" What's the Tea Party case against the rules? Republicans killed a Democratic measure that would have forced members and staff to disclose whether they use federally funded health care. It's not something Tea Partiers obsessed over, but it's not transparent, either. Republicans have implemented a ""cut as you go rule"" to theoretically match all new spending with cuts. It doesn't include the cost of a repeal of health care reform. But Republicans and Tea Partiers don't believe that repeal will cost money, so they're not sweating it. The flashier but less important Tea Party victory today came in the Rules Committee. It held a preliminary hearing on how the vote to repeal health care reform--bill coming tomorrow, vote next Wednesday. That's what the Tea Party demanded all through 2010, and an unconstitutional hiccup--the rules committee was organized by a member who had not been sworn in--might not matter in the end. What is the Don't Tread On Meter?It will track the progress (or lack thereof) of the Republican House of Representatives, and the Republican conference in the Senate, in fulfilling the promises they made to Tea Party activists.

2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/01/speaking_softly.html	"Usually when politicians come to their big moment they crank up the lofty rhetoric. They swirl around in the heavens, or do some resolving, or take a backstroke through the great American this or that. Backward run their sentences as Kennedy they try to approach but closer to Yoda they come. John Boehner, the new House speaker, went the other way. He started in the dust--the Catholic Ash Wednesday ritual of smearing ashes on the forehead. ""The ashes remind us that life in all--all of its forms is very fragile, our time on this Earth fleeting,"" he said early in his remarks after acknowledging his family and friends. ""But as the ashes are delivered, we hear those humbling words: Remember, you are dust, and to dust you shall return."" Humble. That's the word Boehner kept repeating. Everything about his swearing-in was modest. When Nancy Pelosi became speaker in 2007, Richard Gere and Tony Bennett sat in her section. Boehner's box was full of Boehners--10 of his 11 siblings. Four years ago, when members stood to announce the name of their candidate for speaker, many of the Democrats added a little filigree. Jesse Jackson Jr. nominated Pelosi in the name of Rosa Parks and Harriet Tubman and ""in the name of Jesus Christ."" Others nominated her in the name of the children of Katrina and Darfur. There was almost none of that this time. When Republicans announced who they were voting for, most simply said ""Boehner,"" not even bothering with his first name. When the Ohio congressman finally took to the microphone, after twice having to press his white handkerchief into the corner of his eyes, he said: ""It's still just me."" Boehner did not try to lift his rhetoric above his lectern. It must be said: This speaker is no speaker. He gave a flat reading of a workmanlike speech. Boehner's message was that all 435 members of the House are there temporarily, at the behest of the voters who can throw them out in two years. The age of austerity applies to everything from budgets to personal ambition. Though it was his day, Boehner spoke only 30 more words than Pelosi, who preceded him with a recitation of all that Democrats had accomplished and who went on a bit too long. He was one-sixth the length of Newt Gingrich's 6,000-word indulgence in 1995. Boehner's main policy message was that the government and the debt have gotten too large and the 112th Congress will face difficult and painful decisions about what government can do. But he focused as much on how the House would work as he did on policy. He promised he would be a speaker to all members and open the process to the minority. ""To my friends in the minority, I offer a commitment,"" he said. ""Openness, once a tradition of this institution, but increasingly scarce in recent decades, will be the new standard."" (Though it will not be the new standard immediately; Republicans are starting off with a closed process that shuts out Democrats.) Boehner selected an XXL gavel for the ceremony and Pelosi handed it over (two hands, please) with  class, just as Boehner had four years earlier. Denny Hastert was Pelosi's immediate predecessor but he was on his way out of office and stood at the back of the room at her swearing-in, as if he were merely a visitor. Democrats generally gave Boehner a polite reception. Barney Frank even stood to applaud at the right moment, though his hands made such imperceptible movements that he wouldn't have activated the towel dispenser in a public restroom. The real star was MSNBC's Joe Scarborough. Like all former members, he can walk on the floor, and that's what he chose to do during the lull between the vote and Boehner's entrance. Democrats greeted him with hugs, pats, and performance bonhomie, as if he'd just been named conference chairman. Dan Quayle also took advantage of the former-member privilege. He was there with his son Ben, a freshman member from Arizona who did not look as if he had started to make good on his promise to ""knock the hell out of"" the place. Maybe he was waiting till Dad left. That may have been the oldest parent-child pairing. Mostly there were little kids sitting in laps and backward in empty seats. During a pause one young lad in a blue blazer appeared to be making snow angels on the floor. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and her teenage daughter, who is a little taller than her mother, shifted positions regularly as they both tried to occupy a single front seat. It seemed a lumpy compromise when there were open seats to be had, but perhaps even this was in keeping with the day. In the age of austerity, everyone is going to have to double up.

The promise tour typically began with sit-downs in 2009 at Tea Party meetings and town halls, where conservative activists put you on the record about the 16th Amendment, the Federal Reserve, and about 100 other things you had to study up on. The tour continued as some of these groups put their pledges into writing, and put them on the stack of conservative pledges--Americans for Tax Reform's no-tax pledge, the Death Tax Repeal pledge, pro-life pacts--that Republicans have been signing for years. A comprehensive listing of every promise every Republican candidate agreed to would take up the entire Internet, but these two documents are a good place to start: the grassroots Contract From America and the Republican Pledge to America. Will they fulfill their promises? That's what the Don't-Tread-on-Meter is for. It will track the progress (or lack thereof) of the Republican House of Representatives, and the Republican conference in the Senate, in fulfilling the promises they made to Tea Party activists. Scores range from 0 to 100, and we start today with the meter at 5, as the House is about to read the Constitution aloud and agree to rules that fulfill an essential part of every Tea Party pledge, spelled out in the Pledge to America: ""We will adhere to the Constitution and require every bill to cite its specific Constitutional Authority.""

Before noon, the House chamber was empty but for a new member showing his family the floor. There were no rambling school tours, just a small group of Chinese tourists (presumably checking on their investment). But the leaders of the two parties were there. Nancy Pelosi, on her last day as speaker, walked with the middle-distance stare of the powerful. Her successor, John Boehner, didn't have the same look. His eyes met those of the people he passed as he headed outside. A dozen staffers and security walked with him. In the empty halls, they looked like a school of Gray Suit fish. It was a twilight day. Power has transferred, but the titles haven't yet. At a press conference Pelosi was as determined as her walk. ""I don't really look back. I look forward,"" she said when asked to reflect on her speakership. Steny Hoyer, No. 2 in the Democratic leadership, was less formal. He congratulated Eric Cantor, the Republican who now holds his job as majority leader, for ""taking a title I really liked having. You can keep calling me that if you want."" Later, Hoyer held a briefing just before Cantor was scheduled to have one in the fancier offices that the majority gets. Hoyer joked to reporters that he would cut his remarks short so they wouldn't miss Cantor. ""You'll want to hear what's really going on,"" he said. The parties have switched not only offices but arguments. Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said Republicans were going to spend ""countless hours trying to repeal health care reform rather than focusing on jobs, the economy and deficit reduction. Every minute wasted on trying to repeal health care reform fruitlessly is one less minute the Republicans will spend on job creation and turning this economy around."" If that sentiment sounds familiar, it's because it was a Republican refrain during the House's debate over health care in 2009 and 2010. Sometimes this required the Democrats to contradict themselves. They complained that the GOP House effort to repeal health care was a meaningless show because the Democratic Senate will never allow such a measure to proceed. But when defending their record on economic issues from the last session, they pointed to bills they passed that they knew would never get past a Republican filibuster in the Senate. Democrats also complained that the Republicans were adding to the deficit and have shut them out of the legislative process. Next week, when the House votes to repeal health care (or, ""job-killing health care,"" as they call it), Democrats will not be allowed to add amendments. They were also not allowed to participate in writing the rules under which the measure will be considered. Democrats did this kind of thing when they were in power, of course, but they say Republicans had pledged to be more open and transparent. This exchange of complaints is as fundamental to the institution as its marble steps. I asked Cantor about all this at his press conference. For the last several months Republicans have retold the story of Cantor's debate over the stimulus bill with President Obama early in 2009, in which the president ended the discussion by saying, ""I won."" Republicans viewed that as proof he had no intention of working with them in earnest. Why shouldn't House Democrats take the same message from the GOP now? ""We're not taking that attitude,"" said Cantor. He then explained why the repeal vote should go forward under strict rules, and it sounded like a longer version of the answer Obama had given him. The issue ""has been litigated according to the American people, if you look at the polling on this,"" he said. ""What the American people are saying, by the outcome of this election, is 'we don't like this outside-the-mainstream agenda that we've seen coming out of Washington over the last two years.' "" In other words: We won. When the Republicans start working on their replacement health care bill, ""that will be a process of openness,"" he said, which can only succeed if the two parties work together. From his side, Hoyer said bipartisan cooperation is not a cliche, but will be a requirement. It's the only way a Republican House can work with a Democratic Senate and president. Republican Tea Party backers will have to get over that. ""My presumption is that they don't have happy families,"" said Hoyer of Tea Party absolutists. ""Life is about trying to reach accommodation with each other."" Cantor had called his press conference to outline a governing philosophy for the new majority. The GOP will focus on creating jobs and cutting spending. The catchphrase for the 112th Congress is ""cut and grow,"" which sounds like a lawn service jingle (it is, in fact). He reiterated the pledge to cut spending by $100 billion to 2008 levels for nondefense spending but would also include defense cuts. ""Everyone is going to have to do more with less,"" said Cantor. Democrats have said the repeal of health care already undermined GOP pledges of fiscal austerity because the Congressional Budget Office said the legislation saved $140 billion over 10 years. Cantor said the nonpartisan office's calculations were inaccurate. (Which is why House Republicans justify going around their own new accounting rules.) Cantor was less specific about voting to raise the debt limit. He ducked the question of whether he would vote to raise it. GOP leaders are not going to allow the U.S. government to default, but they would rather delay a possible fight with Tea Party activists, and the members they love, who oppose raising the limit. On the eve of the biggest GOP majority in 70 years, why test whether Hoyer is right about the chance for happiness and harmony in the GOP family?

Most will be distractions from the drama in Congress and in the 50 states sorting out their survival in a world where Medicare funding is iffy and bailout money is never going to come.

6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/12/the_ghost_of_gaffes_past.html	"The 2010 midterms marked the final handover of political news judgment from the professionals to the amateurs and operatives. Consider: Four years ago, when then-Sen. George Allen of Virginia, then running for re-election, called a Democratic video tracker ""Macaca,"" you could not see the video on your phone. You couldn't tweet it. It was largely up to news organizations whether they covered the video, which is why conservatives blamed the Washington Post for blowing it up into a scandal by covering every angle of the incident. Isn't that quaint? Now we find out about damaging gaffes and videos because people record them (or clip them from TV) and put them online, then spread the word through social media. Most of the ""must-see videos"" from the trail this year got that way because conservative or liberal blogs were obsessing over them and the rest of the media had to notice. And that often led to a pack-dog mentality about these videos or other gaffes: Because everyone was talking about them, they had a political impact, and that often became more important than what the pols were actually saying. All of these elections are history now, of course. But in the season's spirit of cheer and forgiveness, it seems fair to rescue a few of these gaffes or flubs from the feeding frenzies we left them in. It's pretty easy to tell if a flub is being manipulated for political impact. Is the title of the YouTube clip different from the quote in the article? Does it cut off in the middle of a sentence? I embed, you decide. Christine O'Donnell: ""Where in the Constitution is the separation of church and state?"" By Oct. 19, when O'Donnell debated Chris Coons at Delaware's Widener Law School, her image as a frothy Palin clone was impossible to shake. In a vacuum, her exchange with Coons would have done what she wanted to do--serve as a dog whistle to social conservatives while exposing Coons as a dogmatic liberal. But she wasn't running in a vacuum, and her question about the establishment clause kicked off days of mockery about how little she knew about the Constitution.What was O'Donnell trying to do? She wanted to signal to social conservatives that she was on their side of the church-and-state debate. A literal reading of the Constitution, she was saying, would tell you that there is no separation. Slate's Will Saletan adeptly explained why, on the merits of how the Constitution is currently interpreted, O'Donnell was wrong. She was wrong as a political strategist, too--you don't win an election in Delaware by proving your social-conservative cred to an electorate that's voted Democratic for president in every election since 1992. But this was a pander, not a flub. Nancy Pelosi: ""We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it."" On March 9, the Speaker of the House spoke to the National Association of Counties about the health care bill that was days away from final passage. This was the phrase that launched a thousand campaign ads. Nine months later, this is remembered as Pelosi admitting what Tea Partiers had feared: that Democrats were ramming through bad bills without reading them. That wasn't actually what she was saying.

7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/12/into_the_blue.html	"When the United States Census Bureau released its new 2010 population data on Tuesday, the biggest headline--other than our arrival at the crucial benchmark of 308,400,408 people in America--was that the numbers favor Republicans in 2012. That's true on its face: Several red states got more House representatives, while blue states lost some. But that ignores the shifting demographics of the country, which in the long run favor Democrats. The census data released yesterday counted people, but it didn't say anything about who they are.  The figures show that the populations of traditionally Republican states like Texas, Georgia, Arizona, and Utah are growing, while those of Democratic states like New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey grew less. *  The faster-growing states therefore get more congressional districts--Texas gains four seats in the House, for example--while the slower-growing states lose them. What the data doesn't tell you--yet--is the demographic makeup of these shifting populations: their race, ethnicity, age, education level, and income. The Census Bureau will roll out that data in February and March, according to a spokesman. Until then, we won't know whether the United States is becoming more Democratic or more Republican. But trends over the last decade or so suggest the country is becoming bluer. When we talk about population growth in the United States, we're almost invariably talking about a group that votes Democratic. Political scientist Ruy Teixeira, who co-authored  The Emerging Democratic Majority back in 2006, points out that minority voters have grown by 11 percent over the last 20 years while relatively conservative white working-class voters have decreased by 15 points. Emory University's Alan Abramowitz projects that nonwhite voters will constitute one-third of the electorate in 2020. (By 2042, the entire U.S. population will be more than half minority.) College-educated women, 65 percent of whom supported Obama in 2008, went from 8 percent of the over-25 female population to 28 percent over the last 40 years. Young voters, who went for Obama 66-32, add 4 million new members to their ranks every year. Professionals, 68 percent of whom voted for Obama, are the ""fastest-growing occupational group,"" according to Teixeira. And, adding insult to injury, the fastest-growing religious population is ""unaffiliated"" voters, three-quarters of whom voted for Obama. Does that mean the country will become permanently Democratic? Of course not. Both parties will adjust to accommodate the shifting demographics. But Republicans will be playing catchup. The GOP will inevitably become more amenable to immigration reform, gay marriage, and separation of church and state, as their constituencies become more Hispanic, educated, and godless, respectively. Hispanics may not support Democrats forever--in 2004, about 40 percent voted for Bush--and some young Democrats will become old Republicans, but the blue team will have a lead. Even the Republicans' short-term gains aren't all good news. Democrats point out that much of the population growth tracked by the 2010 census is in blue regions of red states. For example, Nevada leans Republican but its population boom is largely in Democratic Clark County. Same with Texas, where the boom is attributable mainly to an influx of Latinos and African-Americans. ""Latinos have a significant presence in the states that gained congressional seats and less of a presence in states that lost seats,"" says Paul Taylor of the Pew Research Center. Gerrymandering can blunt the impact of Democratic population growth. That's why the Republicans' domination of state legislatures is a big deal: Even if a state's Hispanic population is booming, redistricting makes it easy to squeeze them into the smallest number of districts. Gerrymandering can backfire if a party gets overzealous, but the shakeout will likely favor the GOP. That said, political winds don't really matter when the ground is shifting underneath.

8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/12/the_socialist_network.html	"If you want to remember how people used to talk about Barack Obama, go back to a TV clip from Oct. 23, 2008. Joe Biden sat gamely for a satellite interview with Barbara West, a local news anchor in Orlando, Fla. She wanted to get to the bottom of what Obama meant when he told sometime-plumber Joe Wurzelbacher that everyone benefits when you ""spread the wealth around."" ""You may recognize this famous quote,"" said West. "" 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.' That's from Karl Marx. How is Sen. Obama not being a Marxist if he intends to spread the wealth around? Biden squinted, looking for Ashton Kutcher out of the corner of his eye. ""Are you joking? Is this a joke? ""No."" ""Is that a real question?"" ""That's a question."" Later, West asked Biden what he'd ""say to the people who are concerned that Barack Obama will want to turn America into a socialist county, much like Sweden."" Days away from being elected vice president, Biden snorted that he didn't ""know anyone who thinks that, apart from the far right wing of the Republican Party."" Interview over. Future interviews with West, canceled. Two years on, how quaint does this sound? The people convinced that Obama wants to turn America into a socialist country now include the Republicans who will soon run the House of Representatives, and they did not shy away from saying this in their campaigns. At this point, a conservative who calls Obama a socialist is risking a primary challenge from the right; what is he, too wimpy to call the guy a fascist? Maybe this is why Stanley Kurtz's political biography of Obama, Radical-in-Chief, has been received with such a shrug. He's given us a dense analysis of Obama and ""the untold story of American Socialism,"" backed up by copious primary sources listed in 72 pages of endnotes. All that research meant that the book was beat to the ""Why Conservatives Should Fear Obama"" shelf by four Glenn Beck books (one of them a novel); No. 1 New York Times best-sellers by Michelle Malkin, David Limbaugh, and Dick Morris; and documentaries like Generation Zero--no shortage of material making the Obama-as-Swedenizing-strongman case. The discriminating reader who wants the ""untold story"" about Obama has already picked up The Manchurian Presidentor Dinesh D'Souza's fast-selling screed that sees an aspiring African strongman in the White House. And this is sort of a shame. Kurtz actually hit the trail, dug into the archives at the Wisconsin Historical Society, the papers of Harold Washington, and the Chicago Defender, and apparently read every word written by the Hyde Park intelligentsia and politicos of the 1980s and '90s to find out just how much the young Barack Obama palled around with socialists. The answer: more than Obama has admitted. The score gets settled between Kurtz and Obama's fact-checking site, FightTheSmears, which originally called these stories crazy. Obama didn't really keep his distance from ACORN before it became politically toxic in the late aughts, and Project Vote, the registration drive he ran in 1992, definitely did some work with ACORN. Obama worked with Bill Ayers and Bill's less-terrorism-inclined brother John. He even attended socialist conferences in New York.OK, the last fact isn't actually a Kurtz discovery. In Dreams From My Father, Obama mentions ""socialist conferences I sometimes attended at Cooper Union."" In 2007 and 2008, when the ""Marxist Obama"" attack was laughed out of any room bigger than an Orlando TV studio, reporters didn't make much of this. Kurtz makes so much of it that he attempts to figure out exactly which conferences Obama went to, such as the 1983 Cooper Union Socialist Scholars Conference, and to mind-meld with the 22-year-old student at pivotal times to figure out why, later, he became a community organizer. Based on the panels he might have gone to, Kurtz determines which ideas planted themselves in Obama's head, and why. ""Although it seems unlikely that Obama would have passed up the entire Race & Class in Marxism panel,"" writes Kurtz, ""it's easy to imagine him dashing over to catch [John] Conyers's talk and then moving back to the session on race and class."" There's a catch, of course. ""Obviously, we can't know Obama's movements in detail. The point is that the themes we're discussing were conference-wide."" All of Kurtz's research is presented this way, as excavations from primary sources that tell us who wrote what articles and what happened at various meetings in the history of American socialism. Once his case is made, he explains how close Obama was to it all. It's fascinating, but it doesn't really prove what Kurtz wants it to prove. His first problem is that so much of his case depends on the power of that magic word socialism. Kurtz benefits from the fact that it causes a full-body freak-out among American voters and politicians, with images of gulags, bread lines, and  Red Dawn. (There's a Red Dawn remake coming soon in which the Cuban and Russian soldiers are replaced by Chinese ones, so the magic's not fading.) And now that no one looks at you funny for calling a Democrat a ""socialist,"" a conservative can win a debate by saying he wants to follow the Constitution while his opponent wants to follow Marx. The December 2010 unemployment rate is proof that Marx is wrong and Madison is right. Debate over. But it isn't so simple. You can oppose a policy because you're a radical who wants to bring down the government. You can also oppose a policy because it's rotten. Kurtz calls out one socialist group for ""one of the first campaigns against bank 'red-lining,' paving the way for ACORN's fateful attack on the mortgage industry decades later."" Yes, socialists were among the opponents of a policy introduced by the Federal Housing Administration that discouraged loans and investment to minority neighborhoods. They were right about it. Later, Kurtz wonders ""how remarkable would it be if ACORN did in fact have a significant role in precipitating [the financial] crisis."" He argues that it does, because ACORN lobbied Congress and the Clinton administration to put Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the subprime business, and because Columbia university sociologists Frances Fox Piven and Richard Cloward once argued that activists could overwhelm the state by over-registering people for welfare benefits--put it together, and you have the financial crisis, or a version of it that turns the makers of CDOs into bystanders. This problem comes up again and again. If you look for socialism in Obama's past, you can find it; and if you look for it in his presidency, everything seems like a hammer and sickle. But does this give us a deeper understanding of what the Democrats are up to? Or is socialism a word that, applied to Democrats, makes their policies less popular? Kurtz sees socialism as the only way to explain Obama's ""insistence on pressing an ambitious program of health-care reform during an economic downturn."" A simpler explanation could be that he's a liberal Democrat, and liberal Democrats have been trying to do what he did on health care for half a century. Pointing out that some of their ideas came from socialists, and locating the wellsprings of those ideas, is useful history. It helps explain where some of the concepts adopted by liberals come from. What it doesn't explain is how those liberals end up running the place once they're in power. And that sets up the second problem with Kurtz's book. Since losing the House of Representatives, President Obama has negotiated with Republicans to give them much of what they wanted on tax cuts. A man trained by the best socialists Chicago had to offer has just agreed to let the estate tax sink to its lowest-ever permanent rate. According to Politico's Robert Kuttner, Obama is ready to take a step that was telegraphed when he set up the debt commission and start cutting back Social Security. There's a reason why Beck and the gang focus on Obama's more obscure appointees than on his big-ticket items: The hard left isn't at all satisfied with the big-ticket items. But Kurtz argues that ""the best way to understand the president's policies is to see them as a series of steps designed to slowly but surely move the country closer to a socialist ideal."" I've got another theory about Barack Obama. He's a liberal, but he knows who he needs to impress and what they care about. He figured out early on what soothed Hyde Park socialists, and later he figured out how to win over Springfield and Washington Republicans. He's not an unblinking, unrepentant socialist. He's a liberal political hack. He's just been good at knowing how much everyone else likes to obsess over labels. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	Is President Obama still a Marxist if he cuts taxes?

When he talked about hope and change and a new era of politics, some imagined it would all be swift, easy, and relatively painless once he took office. He's not risking that outcome with his plan to shrink the budget deficit. What he's promising does not sound fun at all. Next year, he said, he will ""engage in a conversation with the American people about the hard choices we're going to have to make."" Explaining why he had to make a deal with Republicans on extending the Bush tax cuts, he said: ""What I want to do is to essentially get the American people in a safe place ... and then we're going to have to have a broad-based discussion across the country about our priorities."" As a rule, if someone promises a painful conversation requiring a safe place, it's time to run (or get a room, if you're into that kind of thing). But there is nowhere to run. The current level of deficit spending is unsustainable. The American people know this, and they want the president to do something. Yet they show no interest in supporting the hard choices that are required. This poses two challenges for Obama: Can he really have a conversation about sacrifice in a political system that seems capable of only minting short-term delights? And how does the president convince the country to sign on to so much pain while trying to get re-elected? Public opinion on the deficit problem is mixed. Some polls show that people care about it. In an AP-CNBC poll last month, 85 percent of those asked believed that the increasing federal debt will harm their children's and grandchildren's financial future. Some surveys show less concern.  A recent CBS News poll showed only 4 percent of the public want the new Congress to focus on the deficit in January. But polls are pretty clear in revealing that people are not anxious to have this conversation the president is promising. A recent Washington Post/ABC News poll shows little support for the major options being discussed for addressing the deficit. A recent Bloomberg poll shows similar sentiment. ""The American people show no appetite to make the hard choices to balance the budget,"" says pollster Peter Hart. There are ways to encourage people to accept shared sacrifice. The president's deficit commission tried to scare the paste out of people: Fix the deficit or the economy will collapse. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., went beyond mere economic peril and talked about the decline of American civilization, rotting from within. President Obama has pointed to these dark clouds, and surely will again. But selling a policy based on gloom and doom is hard to sustain. It didn't work for him with health care. The president started his pitch arguing that the system had to be reformed to halt the unsustainable growth of health care inflation. It wasn't the only thing he talked about, but it sent the loudest signal. People took talk of curbing costs to mean they would have to sacrifice something. When the president said certain cost reforms, like those related to end-of-life care would require a ""very difficult democratic conversation"" (there's that word again), people got spooked. Doom and gloom isn't Obama's best channel. He's much better at uplift, which reminds people of what they liked about him in the first place. The president won't be just selling a deficit reduction plan. He'll also be making the case for his re-election. Do people want to hear more change is coming--and unpleasant change at that? After Obama just suffered an election defeat because he tried to change things too much? Obama can't avoid the conversation, say White House aides. The economic realities of the moment demand hard choices. Republicans are also talking about sacrifice. So at least this will be a competition of ideas, not simply a referendum on the president's plan. The uplifting package into which Obama will tuck this tough talk was previewed at the president's recent speech in North Carolina, which White House aides say is a template for the next year. The message is that if America doesn't get smart about how it spends money, the country will fall farther back in the global race. In the speech at Forsyth Technical Community College, the president talked about that competition the way Cold War presidents talked about the missile gap. ""As it stands right now, the hard truth is this: In the race for the future, America is in danger of falling behind."" Obama recounted the list of statistics--from college graduation rates to the proportion of science and engineering degrees--that proved his point. Then he made the Cold War link explicit. ""Our generation's Sputnik moment is back. This is our moment.  If the recession has taught us anything, it's that we cannot go back to an economy that's driven by too much spending, too much borrowing, running up credit cards, taking out a lot of home equity loans, paper profits that are built on financial speculation. We've got to rebuild on a new and stronger foundation for economic growth. We need to do what America has always been known for: building, innovating, educating, making things. We don't want to be a nation that simply buys and consumes products from other countries. We want to create and sell products all over the world that are stamped with three simple words: ""Made in America."" For a president who is accused by conservatives of not boasting about America, the coming conversation about priorities will be framed around verses of the American song. ""He believes in the exceptional quality of the American people and American exceptionalism,"" says David Axelrod, ""and that exceptionalism is defined by the ability to meet challenges of our times."" The president can also fit this pitch to appeal to CEOs with whom he is anxious to repair relations. According to Mark Knoller of CBS, at the end of Obama's remarks to his Export Council last week, the president said this would be the theme of his State of the Union address: ""What does it take to make us competitive? We're not gonna draw a wall around America. We're out there leading. That's what we've always done. We don't shy away from competition. We beat the competition. But we don't do it just by beating our chests, we do it by hard work and a good strategy."" The debate over the next budget will be epic and familiar. The parties will play their familiar roles. Republicans will try to paint the president as the protector of wasteful social spending. His priorities, they will say, are simply social redistribution. The better he can make the competitiveness case, the better chance he has of breaking out of that box. The theme sounds potentially stirring. It seems like good packaging for a president trying to sell a tough set of notions. And if anything actually comes of it, we'll all be very surprised. Even the best rhetoric applied to austerity has to overcome the disinterest in it. Voters show new appetite perhaps because politicians in Washington seem to be nothing but appetite. The tax cut deal that just passed the Senate is going to cost roughly $900 billion and none of it is paid for. Economists say this is smart, given the economy's fragile state. That rationale doesn't work as well for the earmarks contained in a $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill Congress is trying to pass before everyone goes home for the holidays. Perhaps they will find their safe place there and return to Washington prepared for this new conversation. Expectations are low. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook.

10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/12/crisis_junkies.html	"New Hampshire Sen. Judd Gregg and Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh are retiring from the Senate, handing over their desks next month. This might explain why both senators seem so thrilled about the coming fiscal Ragnarok. In an interview on CNBC on Monday, live from the post-partisan launch of No Labels, Bayh said that Democrats and Republicans could come together to attack the debt if there was ""a precipitating event of some kind."" Gregg jumped in. ""The event`s going to be the debt ceiling,"" he said. ""We`re going to hit this debt ceiling sometime in April. I believe, genuinely believe that there is going to be significant action in discretionary control, in Social Security, in entitlement reform and in tax reform. ... And it's going to all occur and the forcing mechanism is going to be the debt ceiling."" Bayh nodded. ""I agree with Judd 100 percent."" Easy for them to say, since they won't be around for the tough votes. But plenty of people who will be around for those votes are saying the same thing. The current tax cut deal moves us closer to hitting the current debt ceiling of $14.2 trillion, which moves the analysts at Moody's closer to downgrading America's bond rating. This might seem like more of a reason to oppose the tax deal than a reason to force an apocalyptic debt ceiling vote. And some Democrats are using it as one. Sen. Mark Udall (D-Col.) asked if the Senate was suspended in a ""parallel universe,"" since it had so quickly forgotten all the warnings about debt coming out of the Simpson-Bowles commission. ""The president's fiscal commission called our national debt a 'cancer' that is threatening our country from within!"" said Udall. It sure did. And so did Udall. Nobody in Washington gets anything done anymore without explaining how the failure to do it will cause an extinction-level event. There's nothing new about hyping a potential crisis to get political allies to sign on to your agenda. It's just happening more frequently now, and with higher stakes, for two big reasons. The first is that Americans are growing gloomier about the future. Polls on whether the country's on the right or wrong track have leaned toward ""wrong track"" for roughly five years. A new Allstate/National Journal poll found that one in five Americans expected their economy to be the strongest in the world this century; half expected us to lose out to China. In the 2008 campaign, Barack Obama said the higher-income Bush tax cuts needed to go to prevent us from getting further in hock to China; in the 2010 campaign, now-Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois went so far as to watch a Treasury debt auction and return from it warning of a coming default. It's not hard to convince Americans that bad policy will turn us into a second-rate power, because they think it's already happening. The second reason is that liberals and conservatives believe that the other team is trying to provoke a crisis. Liberals have thought this for a while. In 1978, at the dawn of the supply-side tax movement, future Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan made the case for deep tax cuts by saying they'd force future policymakers to make tough spending decisions. ""The basic purpose of any tax cut program in today's environment,"" said Greenspan, ""is to reduce the momentum of expenditure growth by restraining the amount of revenue available and trust that there is a political limit to deficit spending."" That idea later became known as ""starving the beast,"" and liberals hear it working whenever Republicans talk about massive spending cuts being forced on the next Congress because of the debt ceiling. Conservatives think liberals are trying the same thing. In the 1960s, left-wing scholars Richard Cloward and Frances Fox Piven argued that more Americans should go on welfare in order to overload the system and force the federal government to ""advance a federal solution to poverty that would override local welfare failures, local class and racial conflicts and local revenue dilemmas."" In 2009 and 2010, many conservatives began to argue that Cloward and Piven's vision had come true, and it had worked. The financial crisis, they said, was brought about by leftists forcing banks to make bad loans, in the hope of bringing on ... well, a financial crisis. Glenn Beck explained it dozens of times on his Fox News show. ""Cloward and Piven instructed activists that if a crisis did not exist, promote or manufacture one by exaggerating some unthreatening predicament,"" he said in January. ""Global warming anyone? And, to an extent, health care?"" The result of all this is that everyone--hardcore conservatives, sensible moderates, Socialist former mayors of Burlington--understands that ""staving off a crisis"" is the best way to get your message heard. Rahm Emanuel previewed Barack Obama's agenda by saying, ""Never let a serious crisis go to waste."" Republicans see the debt ceiling vote as a crisis not to be wasted. ""Imagine what would happen if Moody's downgraded the rating before the vote,"" said one GOP aide, explaining what Republicans might do to make sure the debt ceiling debate starts with serious discussions of deep spending cuts. ""That would turn this place upside down."" No one should read too much into the failure of conservative groups--and the vast majority of Republicans--to oppose a tax deal that doesn't pay for itself. It's not supposed to pay for itself. It sets the table for a few months in which conservatives and Republicans can organize around the cuts and assaults on sacred cows that could prevent the need to raise the debt ceiling. That will mean more YouCut-style contests for user-driven spending reductions, but it will mean larger, more serious attacks on entitlements, too. You can't really have that debate unless you're trying to stave off a crisis. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	After the tax deal vote, get ready for another fiscal apocalypse.
11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/12/read_the_label.html	"Everything you need to know about the new political group No Labels is contained in its slogan: ""Not Left. Not Right. Forward."" It's smug. It sounds like an Obama campaign catchphrase. And it ignores the whole reason politics exists, which is that not everyone agrees on what ""Forward"" is. A group of political and media A-listers descended on Columbia University Monday morning for the group's big launch event, which co-founder Mark McKinnon dubbed in his introductory remarks ""our little Woodstock of democracy."" No Label seeks to be the voice of reason in an increasingly hyper-partisan environment--a counterweight to interest groups at either end of the political spectrum. Instead of rewarding candidates who spew partisan talking points, No Label says it will raise money for moderate candidates who embrace what co-founder Jon Cowan calls the ""three C's"": co-sponsors, common ground, and civility. The guest list at Monday's confab said as much about the group as its slogan. Attendees were a mix of media commentators (David Brooks, Joe Scarborough, Mika Brzezinski), recent political losers (former Delaware Rep. Mike Castle, former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist), politicians who aren't seeking re-election (New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh), and moderates who have special permission to buck their party (incoming West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman). In other words, a bunch of people with nothing at stake. Even if they did have something to lose, signing onto ""No Labels"" is risk-free. The group's mission statement is filled with the bland pablum of political campaigns. It's the kind of stuff that's so obvious, no one would ever disagree. ""Americans are entitled to a government and a political system that works--driven by shared purpose and common sense."" Unlike all those groups that prefer a political system that doesn't work. ""Americans want a government that empowers people with the tools for success ... provided that it does so in a fiscally prudent way."" Me, I'm for spending wads of money on failure. ""America must be strong and safe, ready and able to protect itself in a world of multiple dangers and uncertainties."" That is going to upset their rival group, Americans Against Strength, Safety, Readiness, and Ability To Protect Ourselves. Their mission is so popular, even Akon could get behind it. (Sample lyric: ""See a man with a blue tie/ See a man with a red tie/ So how about we tie ourselves together and get it done."") And if members were worried about how it would play in the polls, don't worry: Its founder, Nancy Jacobson, is married to Hillary Clinton pollster Mark Penn. To prove that political compromise is possible, politicians at the No Label event touted their own bipartisan achievements. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand cited a bill she co-sponsored with Republican Sen. Tom Coburn that created searchable databases for earmarks. ""He wants to ban all earmarks, and I like federal investments to create jobs, but one thing we agree on is about transparency,"" she said. Well, sure, but they still disagree on banning earmarks and federal spending. Cooperating on a softball issue like transparency doesn't change that. The group takes a pass when it comes to issues that actually divide people, like gay marriage and abortion. Anticipating this critique, the group's Web site argues that social issues have been used to ""keep Americans from working together."" Instead, it says, ""We want to help call a cease-fire in the culture wars by focusing on common ground goals rather than absolutist positions on the left or right."" Even on an issue as polarizing as abortion, says co-founder and CNN personality John Avlon, most Americans agree that the procedure should be ""safe, legal, and rare."" But his answer seems to undermine the point of the group. If there's consensus on so many issues, what's the point of creating a group? To defend that consensus? No Labels sounds noble in theory. But the group misunderstands what bipartisanship is. It's not two parties deciding to be nice to each other. It's a moment when their self-interests happen to align--moments that are increasingly rare. Washington does not have a ""civility problem."" It has a polarization problem. Politicians aren't any meaner now than they were 30 years ago. It's just that over the last few decades, the two parties have become more ideologically coherent. Back in the 1950s, some Southern Democrats opposed racial integration, and some Republicans in the North favored a robust social safety net. Opposition to abortion was a bipartisan affair. There was a Christian right, but there was a Christian left as well. (The first Catholic president was a Democrat, after all.) All of that changed in the '60s and '70s. Small-government libertarians aligned themselves with social conservatives under the Republican umbrella. Social liberals and economic interventionists joined the Democrats. In the 1980s, there was still enough overlap between the parties to beget phrases like ""Reagan Democrats."" But every year the parties drift further apart. In a conversation with NPR about ""No Labels,"" Charlie Crist trotted out the old saw about Ronald Reagan and Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill. Those men ""probably didn't agree on a whole lot of things ... yet were able to get along and at the end of the day, go out and have a cold one and understand that it's important for them to be civil."" Sure. But by today's partisan standards, O'Neill and Reagan had a lot in common. What stops Barack Obama and John Boehner from taking smoking breaks together isn't that they're jerks. It's that they don't agree on as much. That's just Washington, says No Labels. ""The rest of the country is not hyperpartisan,"" McKinnon told the Washington Post. ""They say: 'There's MoveOn on the left, the tea party on the right and nothing in the middle for me.' We're trying to become a microphone for those voices, to create a system that rewards and gives a shout-out for good behavior."" One audience member echoed this point on Monday, arguing that ""independents don't care about labels."" Wrong. Independents pretend not to care about labels. In fact, the vast majority of so-called independents lean toward one party or another. The number of true independents who switch from party to party is 5 percent to 10 percent of the electorate. Perhaps the greatest achievement of No Labels is to show why labels exist in the first place. They're so busy talking about what they're not--not Republican, not Independent, not conservative, not liberal--you never get a handle on what they are. Labels are a useful shortcut for voters who want to know what a group is all about. The lack of a positive mission beyond bipartisanship and civility (which both Republicans and Democrats also call for) makes it hard to know what they really want. There's nothing wrong with calling for reason and civility. Jon Stewart did just that at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear, with eloquence if not tangible success. The difference is that Stewart explicitly removed himself from the political sphere. (Critics got angry that he didn't call for young people to vote.) But both the Stewart rally and No Labels have the same flaw: They promote ""civility"" in media and politics, respectively, when in fact the problem is structural. Fox News gets all huffy over TSA body scanners because of ratings; Republicans fulminate about Democrats trying to pull the plug on grandma for electoral reasons. Fixing the problem isn't a matter of everyone being nicer. It means changing the systemic incentives, whether they're Nielsen ratings or approval numbers. And it's hard to do that without labels.

12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/12/how_he_ticks.html	"President Obama talks a lot. And he talks everywhere-- The Tonight Show, The View, the United Nations. At this rate, if re-elected, he'll be appearing at Shoney's for the Sapersons' anniversary in December 2016. But what moments really stick out? This week, there was one: At his news conference Tuesday, Obama talked about compromise. He was urgent, candid, and wide-ranging. The response was notable because it seemed a few steps closer to the core of a president who often seems encased in bulletproof glass. It's almost two years into his presidency and, as pollster Peter Hart puts it, ""at this stage of the game, [voters] are not sure who he is going to be. ... People still don't have a handle on him."" There have not been a lot of these moments. But there have been a few--and for the most part they come in the speeches that don't require a teleprompter. I have picked five that appear to open a little window into an aspect of the president. None tells the full truth. Some may tell only a momentary truth. Nor are they necessarily weightier than the long, straight-forward policy speeches. But each of these moments offers a little window of truth on Obama. We encourage readers to send in their suggestions for a moment from the Obama presidency that should be included in this list. It can be a single answer at a press conference, or a riff in a speech the president gave, or an answer he gave in a print interview. The one requirement for inclusion here is that the passage be as far as possible from the vacuum-packed and committee-considered speech that we normally get. (Then we can debate whether it represents an authentic moment or a planned authentic moment.) Offer submissions in the comments section or send them to slatepolitics@gmail.com. 1) News conference, Dec. 7, 2010: ""If that's the standard by which we are measuring success or core principles, then, let's face it, we will never get anything done."" Obama is often his loosest in his last answer at a news conference. In this one, Obama gave the most detailed articulation to date of his governing philosophy. He made the case for the sort of compromise, diversity, and working for imperfect progress that have been the hallmark of the American experience. 2) Speech to House Democrats, March 20, 2010: ""Sometimes I think about how I got involved in politics."" House Democrats currently swearing at the president for his deal with Republicans on extending the Bush tax cuts might want to watch this speech again. The president spoke about how doing something to help other people could redeem all the indignities and sacrifice required in politics. 3) Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, Dec. 10, 2009: White House officials would probably pick the president's Cairo speech as his greatest foreign set-piece speech. What made the Nobel speech seem more notable were the awkward conditions--even the president knew he didn't deserve the award, and yet with the speech Obama achieved something that people also expect of his presidency: He made something out of arriving too early. If Obama was given the award because of someone else's agenda, he used the speech to make it about his doctrine, explaining how in his view peace required the occasional use of war. 4) On American exceptionalism, April 4, 2009: In Strasbourg, France, the president was asked for his view of American exceptionalism. His conservative critics have seized on the answer to suggest he does not believe America has played a special role in world affairs. They often quote the first sentence of his answer: ""I believe in American exceptionalism, just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism."" In the complete answer of nearly 300 words, however, it's clear that Obama is saying something more complex.""We have a core set of values that are enshrined in our Constitution, in our body of law, in our democratic practices, in our belief in free speech and equality, that, though imperfect, are exceptional,"" he says. What makes this moment notable is not that the president nails it but that, in real time, without a carefully crafted set of talking points to guide him, he is trying to find the balance between singing the song of America and demonstrating before a foreign audience that he understands that America is not the only country in the world. 5) News conference, March 24, 2009: Asked by CNN's Ed Henry why he waited to express outrage at the bonuses given to executives at AIG, which was the recipient of a federal bailout, the president snapped back, ""I like to know what I'm talking about before I speak."" The question riled the president, because it exposed his aversion to the nakedly theatrical aspects of politics. Not only does he have great distaste for those aspects of the presidency that are purely show, but he is greatly irritated with the 24-hour news cycle, which requires him to engage in performance art of ""showing outrage"" on a regular basis.

13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/12/uncertain_allies.html	"Chuck Schumer did not want to talk to reporters. That's not usually how the romance between New York's senior senator and the Fourth Estate works. He had not been shy this month about promoting his solution to the tax-cut impasse, a millionaire's tax that could save Democrats the indignity of abandoning campaign promises and giving wealthy Americans everything George W. Bush had given them. But when he exited Tuesday's Democratic luncheon, where Vice President Joe Biden was busy force-feeding his party the likely tax-cut compromise, Schumer moved quickly from the meeting room to a senators-only elevator. A scrum of reporters around Sen. Dianne Feinstein gave him cover, but a few reporters saw him and lurched toward him for new quotes. ""I'm only taking questions on 9/11 first responders,"" he said, smiling. He pushed the button, called the elevator, walked in, and zoomed away. And he was being nice. Other Democrats, like Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, responded to the tax compromise by saying what they thought of it. She had voted for the Bush tax cuts and against a millionaire's tax but called the compromise to extend all cuts ""moral corruptness."" The problem for Democrats was twofold. First, they lost. Second, they were being asked to support a policy that they didn't seriously believe would boost the economy, no matter how many times Republicans quoted from Art Laffer's napkin. As they explained why they'd have trouble voting for this compromise--and right now, a majority of Democrats going on the record take that stance--they said it was because they doubted that keeping top marginal rates low would spur any more job growth than it had in 2009 or 2010. Where, exactly, were these small businesses holding off on new hires until they were assured of lower taxes through 2012? ""I've had a good business career and I don't give a damn about tax cuts,"" said Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, who entered politics after making a fortune in data processing. ""I'd rather have a strong country."" The oddity of the proposed tax-cut breakthrough, which President Obama defended against all comers Tuesday, is that it doesn't do what either party thinks will boost the economy. There is one exception, and that's the temporary payroll tax cut--once proposed by Republicans, eventually adopted by Democrats--which, according to Deutsche Bank economists, could boost GDP by 0.7 percent. Up to this week, though, Republicans had been saying that anything less than permanent extension of tax-rate cuts would fail to deliver real economic gains. In a post-election interview with Diane Sawyer, incoming House Speaker John Boehner repeatedly stressed that only permanent rate cuts would eliminate economic uncertainty. ""I don't think that eliminates the uncertainty that's preventing employers from hiring,"" he explained. Republicans thus presented their diagnosis of the economy: Uncertainty was killing it. Uncertainty was preventing businesses from making hiring decisions. Uncertainty was encouraging people with money to find some cool dry place to stash it until Democrats were stopped in their effort to raise taxes. Yet according to National Journal, the compromise ""makes the tax code's problems worse than ever"" while kicking hard decisions on taxes down to the presidential election. The job of Democrats on Tuesday was to fight back against all of this. The job accepted by Republican leaders was to accept it. Temporary tax rate cuts didn't reduce uncertainty last week, but they might do it now. Unemployment insurance was an inducement for workers to drop out of the economy--or was it? The cuts were expected to cost $900 billion, but Republicans reject the premise that taxes ""cost"" money, when they dangle the possibility of supply-side windfalls. The GOP's Senate leadership tentatively backed the plan, then broke off to tell reporters why they did. ""If I'm a small businessman in Tennessee,"" said Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the GOP conference chairman, ""and suddenly I know, for sure, for the next two years, you're not going to be taking the money I earn in taxes, I might be hiring somebody. If I know for one year everything I spend in capital improvements can be deducted, I might spend some money. And if my employees know that their payroll contributions are going to be reduced by one-third? This creates a better environment for job growth. It's not permanent, but it's at least two years."" John Barrasso of Wyoming, the conference vice chairman--he won the job this year when Lisa Murkowski temporarily lost her Senate race in Alaska--fired off a few more things that Democrats could do to reduce troublesome uncertainty. Repealing some health care reforms and regulation, for example--that could do the trick. But he, too, explained that a temporary rate cut that would be warred over through 2012 would supply a surge of certainty. ""You've got to think about the 750,000 small businesses,"" he said. ""They would have seen their taxes go up. Anything you can do to reduce their level of uncertainty works. This is part of it. I would have been for longer. Three years! Make it permanent! But this is what we're getting."" No Republican rushed out Tuesday to say that he or she opposed the deal. Only a few of them would explain why they doubted it could revive the economy, but that wasn't a prelude to opposing the deal. South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint told reporters he wanted another vote on permanent tax-cut extension but hadn't decided whether to back this package, even though the concept of temporary tax-rate cuts was as bad as he'd been saying it was for months. ""I think creating a temporary tax rate is bad for the economy,"" said DeMint. ""I think extending it for two years may alleviate short-term problems but I've worked enough with businesses, major corporations from moving their companies overseas. They do not make their decisions based on two-year tax rates. They're going to look ahead five, 10, in some cases 25 years. If there is still the highest corporate and personal tax rate in the world, it's not good for our economy. We don't want a temporary economy; we don't want temporary tax rates."" Any compromise leaves both sides whimpering over what should have been done instead. This compromise--if it doesn't collapse under its own weight--brings more than the usual level of angst. As the president put it Tuesday and as Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey put it on Friday, Democrats see it as a way of appeasing hostage-takers to save 1.9 million people from losing unemployment benefits. If Republicans seriously believe that the threat to the economy comes from uncertainty, this bill doesn't confront that threat. Victory means everyone agreeing to cave and support something that they'd rather not talk about. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	How the tax-cut deal exposes Republican hypocrisy and Democratic anxiety.

It may have left congressional Democrats seething. It may have rankled some Republicans who wanted to extend the Bush tax cuts permanently, instead of for two years. But at least it proved that the two parties can sit down and hash out a compromise, right? Which could bode well for a similar deal to reduce the deficit, right? Right? Nah. All this compromise proved is that Democrats and Republicans can trade favors that aren't especially damaging to either side. It wasn't the kind of painful chit-swapping that deficit reduction will entail. And it certainly doesn't bring us any closer to solving the deficit crisis--if anything, it pushes us farther away. The deal on the Bush tax cuts does represent compromise. It's just not a tough compromise. Both parties traded policies that were good for both parties--a tax cut extension for Republicans, an unemployment insurance extension for Democrats, an estate tax reduction for Republicans, a student-loan credit for Democrats, and so on. It's like two kids dividing a bowl of Halloween candy and then complaining because each thinks the other got more. A fight over deficit reduction, on the other hand, would require trading painful policies, not pleasurable ones. Just look at the myriad deficit reduction plans that have cropped up in recent weeks. The Bipartisan Policy Center would impose a five-year freeze on discretionary spending, a cap on Medicare benefits, and a 6.5 percent sales tax. A new plan by the Center for American Progress would raise taxes on the rich, reinstate the estate tax, and tax foreign oil--not exactly a bipartisan conversation-starter. The president's commission would raise the retirement age and ""simplify"" the tax system (which would also make it generate more revenue). This last plan--the only one with any real influence--failed to get the 14 out of the 18 votes necessary to recommend it to Congress. If a group of business leaders and former government officials couldn't reach consensus, how will a group of currently serving officials with reelections at stake agree? Another difference between the tax cut deal and deficit reduction: The tax cuts had a deadline. Republicans and Democrats needed to agree on a plan, or else the Bush tax cuts would have expired on Jan. 1--a scenario that horrified both parties, albeit for different reasons. (Some liberal commentators, including Paul Krugman, support letting the cuts lapse.) The parties had two options: make a deal, or sabotage the whole thing and try to blame the failure on the other party. Compromise made sense for both sides. A do-or-die moment hasn't arrived for deficit reduction--yet. The annual deficit exceeded $1.4 trillion this year, and the total national debt has reached $13.8 trillion. Politicos on left and right are harping on the need to reduce the deficit. Think tanks seem to hold weekly forums on the topic. A new wave of Republicans was elected on platforms of fiscal hawkishness. Economists disagree on just how urgent reducing the deficit is. But most acknowledge the need to address it. The indicators of true fiscal crisis--rising interest rates, a sliding dollar, investors threatening to pull their money out of Treasury bonds--haven't happened yet. And until they do, it's hard to imagine the two parties mustering the necessary bipartisan spirit. If anything, Obama's tax deal shows that deficit reduction isn't on the horizon. The plan--a combination of extending old cuts and granting new breaks--would expand the deficit by an estimated $700 billion to $900 billion. Which, my colleague Annie Lowrey points out, amounts to a second stimulus. The White House assures Americans that the plan will not worsen the deficit in the medium and long terms. Setting aside that arithmetic-defying statement, it's fair to push for stimulus now and belt-tightening later on the grounds that the economy is still slumping and spurring economic growth is the best way to reduce the deficit. But the fact that congressional leaders have agreed to balloon the deficit even further without blinking--and that Americans haven't been yelling about it--suggests it's no one's top priority. Americans have been telling pollsters that deficit reduction is more important than economic stimulus. But it's hard to imagine voters punishing their representatives, Democrat or Republican, for cutting their taxes. Assuming that bipartisanship on a relatively easy issue presages bipartisanship on a tough issue ignores what bipartisanship is: a series of self-interested political decisions that happen to line up. Just because those interests line up on tax cuts--neither party wants to see all cuts lapse in 2011--does not mean they line up on deficit reduction. Democrats can ""reach out"" to Republicans all they want. Obama can ""fight harder"" and show more ""nerve"" than anyone thought possible. But as we've learned from health care reform, Wall Street reform, and the stimulus package, bipartisanship occurs only when it absolutely has to. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	Obama struck a bipartisan deal on tax cuts. Can he do the same on deficit reduction?
15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/01/return_of_the_nuclear_option.html	"It's always a shock when a cause I've shouted myself hoarse about acquires broad acceptance.   It's starting to look as though the Senate will alter its rules to curb use of the filibuster. The bad news is that the Senate probably won't eliminate the filibuster altogether or even adopt the toughest compromise proposal, long advocated by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. Under Harkin's plan, the minority's ability to block legislation would diminish with successive votes. Senate leaders would still need 60 votes initially to impose ""cloture""--i.e., to shut off debate. But if Senate leaders lost that vote, they could wait two days and call another vote that would require only 57 votes. If they lost that vote they could wait another two days and call yet another vote that would require only 54 votes, and if they lost that vote they could wait another two days and call a final vote that would require only 51 votes. The Harkin plan defers to the minority's desire for extended deliberation but upholds the principle that ultimately the Senate should conduct most of its business through majority rule. It rocks! But so far it's got only three cosponsors: Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill.; Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.; and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. The good news is that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., who as recently as 2008 was immovably pro-filibuster, has come around. My guess is that he lost patience. In the two-year session just ended Reid killed a record 69 percent of all filibusters but the total number of cloture votes, which prior to 1995 never reached 50, was 91. The filibuster almost killed health care reform and did manage to kill its most important component, the public option. It also killed the climate-change bill. The other good news is that the once-reviled ""nuclear option,"" which would change Senate Rule 22 to allow filibuster procedures to be altered by a simple majority vote (rather than the previous 67-vote majority, which effectively prevented any meaningful filibuster reform) has been rebranded the ""constitutional option""--its original name, in fact--and thereby acquired the respectability it always deserved. Reid will probably invoke the nuc--ahem, constitutional option when a Senate floor vote on the change occurs on or about Jan. 25, even though he publicly rejected it less than one year ago. The principal venue by which filibuster reform became acceptable appears to be a series of Senate Rules Committee hearings chaired by Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., starting this past spring. These discussions led to a proposed resolution (text, summary, video) introduced on Jan. 5 by Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M., Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and Harkin. Udall is on fire over this issue, and his resolution already has 26 co-sponsors--""Halfway there in one day,"" a Udall spokesman boasted. It would eliminate the filibuster on a motion to proceed (as opposed to the bill itself), an annoying obstacle whose removal is long overdue, and it would end the sort of phantom filibusters that became commonplace during the past four decades in which the minority could block legislation without maintaining a presence on the Senate floor. Henceforth, all filibusters would be conducted in the manner Jimmy Stewart made famous in  Mr. Smith Goes To Washington (and, less laudably but more typically outside Hollywood's fantasy realm, the way the late segregationist Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina filibustered against the 1957 Civil Rights Act). Filibustering senators would have to talk themselves hoarse. The Udall-Merkley-Harkin proposal would also eliminate secret ""holds"" on legislation and, in a fair-minded concession to Republicans, eliminate the Senate majority's ability to block amendments through a practice known as ""filling the amendment tree."" Udall's resolution is a halfway measure, but any opportunity to remove half the plaque from the Senate's clogged arteries is well worth seizing. A third proposed reform has also been introduced by Mark Udall, D-Colo., Tom's cousin. (Tom is the son of the late Stewart Udall, Secretary of the Interior under President Kennedy; Mark is the son of the late Arizona Rep. Morris Udall, D.-Az., who sought unsuccessfully his party's presidential nomination in 1976 and later wrote a book titled  Too Funny To Be President.) Cousin Mark's apparent function is to make Cousin Tom's plan seem bold. Most significantly, Mark does not embrace the nuclear/constitutional option, preferring a more ""bipartisan"" agreement that could be agreed to by 67 senators. But which 67 senators might those be? So far Mark's got only two cosponsors (Durbin and Shaheen), neither of them Republicans. The GOP's hypocrisy on the filibuster issue is impressive. In 2005, when the constitutional option was still called the ""nuclear option,"" Senate Majority Whip Mitch McConnell, R.-Ky., liked it just fine. (I egged him on, complaining only that his version applied only to judicial nominees.) Now, however, it ""would undermine the Senate's unique role as a moderating influence and put a permanent end to bipartisanship."" This from the guy who not three months ago said ""The single most important thing we want to achieve is"" not reducing unemployment or bringing peace to Afghanistan or even cutting taxes and shrinking government but ""for President Obama to be a one-term president."" Of course, most Democrats are hypocrites on this issue, too, since they opposed the Senate Republicans' nuclear/constitutional option in 2005. But they got it wrong; the filibuster is an inherently conservative tool because it favors government inaction over government action. Now's their chance to get it right, and it looks as if they're going to take it. Hallelujah. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	The Senate may finally curb the filibuster. Hallelujah.
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/01/story_time.html	"It started, as all debates over the Constitution should start, with angry accusations and howling, partisan laughter. Before the members of the House of Representatives got to read the founding document, Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., started asking why they wouldn't be reading the original text. No three-fifths clause, which counted slaves in the apportionment of congressional districts; no 18th Amendment, banning the sale of alcohol. Why not? ""We have consulted with the Congressional Research Service and the Library of Congress,"" said Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va. ""The Library of Congress actually maintains a copy of the Constitution which contains those sections of the Constitution that have been superseded by amendment."" He was the one who suggested reading the Constitution on the floor, so it was his job to explain all this. (""I guess it's one of those cases where he who sees the need does the deed,"" he said later, to reporters.) Inslee couldn't resist tweaking Goodlatte a little, by reminding him of one of the GOP's campaign promises. ""Would the chairman accept the premise that since we have not been able to see the exact version of the Constitution 72 hours in advance, that this is ..."" Inslee was drowned out by laughter and hoots from the teeming GOP benches, full of freshmen who had queued up for the right to read from the Constitution. Some of them rubbed their eyes as the pre-drama drama went on; more of them looked into the pocket Constitutions they'd brought with them. Inslee wrapped up, saying he also wanted a ""bipartisan success,"" and sat down, but Rep. Jesse Jackson, D-Ill., was next at bat to explain just how important it was for the House to read the outdated, rotten parts of the Constitution. ""This is very emotional for me,"" said Jackson. ""This is very emotional for a number of members, given the struggle of African-Americans, given the struggle of women, given the struggle to create a more perfect document--while not perfect--a more perfect document."" Jackson wanted Congress to hear what had been ""redacted"" and ""deleted."" That set off Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas. He bolted from his seat and grabbed a microphone, whipping it up as if it was a sword he needed to slay some demon hurtling toward him. ""It is important that we use the Constitution itself,"" said Gohmert. ""They are not deletions. They are amendments. And in that respect, we go by the amended document, not by the deleted document. Too many have fought and died for that document to call them deletions."" Goodlatte's completely unexpressive face and voice suited him for this sort of baby-sitting. After Jackson and Gohmert were done, the reading began, with Speaker of the House John Boehner and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi reading the Preamble and Article I, Section I, and the rest of the parties' leadership reading next. Then they left to deal with the Congress' actual agenda--Boehner and Cantor to a press conference, some Democrats to a Rules Committee hearing on the coming vote to repeal ""ObamaCare."" Back on the floor, the Constitution was getting read line-by-line by members who didn't quite know which lines they would get. Only a few of them got selected in advance. The rest depended on luck and an iffy analysis of who would get what depending on where he was sitting. Before the big read, Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, was hoping he'd get to read Article I, Section 8. That's the section that grants Congress, not the president, the power to declare war. Kucinich hoped it would draw attention to legislation he was about to introduce that would give Congress a shot at ending the war in Afghanistan. Plus, no Republican wanted to read that section. ""Everybody wants to read the Second Amendment!"" he said. As it turned out, Kucinich got the section of Article II, Section III that governs the State of the Union speech: ""He may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them."" It was a cruel irony for a man who wielded his own pocket Constitution on two long-shot presidential campaigns. It was less cruel that the section that Rep. Allen West, R-Fla., got was the ""necessary and proper"" clause, better known as the authority that Congress and courts cite for all of those bills that the Tea Party calls unconstitutional. The crowd thinned out quickly. Very few members stuck around after they got their turn at the oversized type on the podium. If there was suspense, it came when, at long last, the amendments were divvied up. Rep. Frank Guinta, R-N.H., lucked out with the Second Amendment, which he read in full voice before leaving the room. Gohmert boomed out the Fourth Amendment, and civil liberties advocates exchanged quiet high-fives as a former judge who backed the Protect America Act and the Military Commissions Act and the Patriot Act got to point out the unconstitutionality of ""unreasonable searches and seizures."" Gohmert returned to the back of the room, a row of fellow Texans behind him, to hold their breath for the next big read: the 10th Amendment. They waited through the rotation and read the Sixth and Eighth Amendments, ready for the big one. Then, tragedy: Goodlatte stepped to the podium and read the 10th himself. Gamely, Gohmert and the Texans started a round of applause, the mission more or less accomplished. Not long after that, the 27th Amendment was read out, members of the House relearned that they can't pass a pay raise ""until an election of representatives shall have intervened,"" and it was over, after an hour and 26 minutes. Only a few dozen members were left to cheer their accomplishment, and slightly fewer than that ventured outside to talk to reporters about it. Democrats failed to make the reading a lesson on the evolving Constitution, sure. But what if they could turn the hype and videos from this into a youth-indoctrinating class on the living document? ""It will encourage teachers at every level in our American school system to go over the Constitution and its amendments and discuss its evolution,"" said Rep. Steve Rothman, D-N.J., one of very few Democrats who sat through the entire read. ""The documents that are in the textbooks contain the entire unredacted versions."" That's what Democrats wanted. Republicans just wanted to follow through on a promise they'd made and refamiliarize members with the source of their authority. The clear implication was the one Tea Partiers made throughout 2010: The previous Congress--that would be the Democratic-controlled Congress--treated the Constitution with insufficient respect. I asked Goodlatte if he agreed with that characterization. The previous Congress did not pay ""enough attention"" to the rules of the Constitution, said Goodlatte. ""I wouldn't say no attention, but not enough attention. That's what generated lawsuits in more than 20 states against health care reform."" Goodlatte fielded another question, about the prospects for tax reform in 2011. ""I am very much an advocate of scrapping our tax code and starting over again,"" he said. ""The House of Representatives twice, in the 1990s, passed something called the Tax Code Elimination Act."" A few minutes earlier, one of Goodlatte's Democratic colleagues had read out the 16th Amendment: ""The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration."" It was a morning of lessons like that: The Constitution will limit you to doing exactly what you had your mind set on doing. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/01/dont_all_speak_at_once.html	"The president's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, announced today that he's leaving the White House. So who will speak for the president now? This question won't be answered merely by naming a successor. The number of people who can speak for the president--plus the inevitable blend of policy defense and political rhetoric that takes place as we move toward the 2012 campaign--could make for some confusion in the White House. The president spoke to Jeff Zeleny of the New York Times shortly after Gibbs' announcement. Gibbs ""will continue to shape the dialogue politically for many years to come,"" Obama said. That's an easy bet. Freed of that confining podium, Gibbs can indulge his more tart, purely political side. His departure already had a nice political edge, partially stepping on John Boehner's big day. (Gibbs' relief at not having to be on time for the tight schedule of the press secretary, and the inevitable apologies and scrambling his lateness required, may be so liberating that jig dancing might provide Gibbs as much exercise as his bike rides.) It will be important for the president to have a pungent outside voice. In the snort and grunt of the campaign season, the president's re-election bid will need some kind of organization that can be a tough advocate for Obama yet remain one step removed from the White House. On the Republican side there are already groups like this, such as American Crossroads, the outside organization set up by Bush veterans Karl Rove and Ed Gillespie. Crossroads can play hardball without their tactics necessarily hurting the GOP nominee. This worked well for Republicans in 2010 despite Democratic efforts to tie the GOP to Rove. Rove and Gillespie, however, are unlike Gibbs in one important respect: They can credibly say that they operate independent of the next GOP nominee. There will always be a question as to whether Gibbs is speaking for the president. This will get confusing and cause headaches for Gibbs' successor. It's not just Gibbs who will make things confusing. White House adviser David Axelrod is an important voice for the president. He's also leaving but not (really) leaving. He'll be in Chicago working on Obama's re-election. David Plouffe, meanwhile, the former Obama campaign manager, is headed in to the White House. He also can be an effective voice for the president. If former Commerce Secretary William Daley becomes the chief of staff, he too will be a spokesman for the president. (Pete Rouse, the interim chief of staff, doesn't play that role.) When the campaign gets under way, there will also probably be another official spokesman for the Obama campaign. That's a lot of voices to compete with the new press secretary. This is not all bad. One of the problems of the Obama administration early on was that the president had to do too much of the talking because the administration had no other effective voice. Obama is still the most effective salesman for his policies, but when he appears so much that you half-expect he'll pop up on the screen of your ATM, his words lose their punch. The downside of so many voices is that when the president wants to send a clear message it's not clear which channel to use. Using multiple channels of communication increases the chance that at any given moment one of those channels can step on the official message of the day. One possible solution is to neuter Gibbs' successor and shut him out of what's really going on, which is what George W. Bush did with some of his press secretaries. The job of the press secretary moves closer to something like press clerk. This might streamline the lines of communication a little, but it would be a disaster. The press secretary has to have power--with the president and the press. He or she is the one at the podium every day, which is still the easiest and fastest way for the president to convey his message. To get that message heard, the press secretary has to have some weight. The press secretary is also the one with the most day-to-day interaction with the correspondents who cover the president. If worked correctly, those relationships can provide the kind of context for presidential coverage that Obama thinks is so lacking. (This is why former journalists are often smart picks for the job.) The reason Obama is not likely to pick a ""soft"" replacement is that it's impossible, as Bush learned, to create a press secretary with a limited portfolio. It creates a situation in which the gaffes or controversial statements get covered but anything the president wants people to hear doesn't. The new press secretary will also need standing because the policy battle over the next few months will be severe and detailed. Obama will need a press secretary who can speak with command about the specifics of budgets and spending. (This was one of Ari Fleischer's talents from years working on the Ways and Means Committee.) In  college Gibbs played goalie for the North Carolina State soccer team *--which was good training for his White House job. Now he moves closer to something like striker. His successor has to hope that the president's overall communications operation won't look like pee-wee soccer, where the ball is surrounded by six players all kicking but going nowhere.

18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/01/rules_for_rascals.html	"The phrase of the day is ""power grab."" This is not a reference to the prying of the speaker's gavel away from Nancy Pelosi by John Boehner. There's no outrage there. The ""power grabs"" are much more sinister, and they're coming from the Republicans in the House and the Democrats in the Senate. If you doubt this, just ask the House Democrats or the Senate Republicans. Start with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. In an op-ed for the Washington Post, McConnell pushed back against a threatened ""power grab"" by Democrats who want to make it tougher to filibuster bills in the new Senate. ""Now that they've lost an election,"" wrote McConnell, ""they've decided to change the rules rather than change their behavior."" All they want are ""partisan rule changes aimed at empowering the majority at the expense of the minority."" Continue with Chris Van Hollen, the Democrats' new ranking member on the House budget committee. He's been yelling to anyone who'll listen about how the incoming Republicans will pass rules that keep the cost of health care reform repeal off the books, and set the government's spending level--for a couple of months--to meet the skinflint standards of Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan. ""What they've done now is invest an incredible amount of power in one person to set the limit,"" said Van Hollen to reporters Tuesday. ""They're going to have to answer for that--it's totally inconsistent with their claim that they were going to be transparent."" Even worse, Van Hollen more or less had to concede that Democrats wouldn't be able to fight this. They would rely on the media to shame Republicans. ""We'll have a rules package that certainly won't include this,"" he shrugged. ""They'll have a majority. They've talked a lot about the importance of transparency, and we agree with them, obviously, on preserving the integrity of the process ... which is why it's alarming to see them take an about-face so quickly."" Can't we start a new session of Congress anymore without this level of sadness? No, we can't. Obscure Capitol rule-making played a bigger role in the last election than anyone expected. Tea Party activists, convinced that members of Congress were passing bills without even trying to read them, grew outraged by things like the ""self-executing rule,"" under which the health care bill could have been ""deemed passed."" (A typical conservative headline of the time: ""Deem and pass or Demon Pass?"") Liberals determined that their agenda was being passed in the House and ground to dust in the Senate, so they asked for--and got--commitments for filibuster reform in 2011. Were all of the angry people right? Mostly, yes. They all identified the reasons that they were losing. But when it comes to demonizing the way Congress works and building public outrage about how the rules work against you, Republicans have it all over the Democrats. They deploy the same argument against giving a Supreme Court seat to Elena Kagan or creating a mandate to buy health care: If the Founders wouldn't have approved of it, neither do we. This was how Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli and then-Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum were able to move so quickly to threaten lawsuits if the health care bill was ""deemed passed."" It was also why they moved just as quickly to sue when the bill passed the House through normal means. Democrats aren't as consistent about this. It's easy for Republicans to dredge up video of the other party pleading for the life of the filibuster in 2005, when Republicans wanted to prohibit its use on judicial nominees, because, well, Democrats used to plead for the life of the filibuster. Republicans aren't won over now when Democrats suggest that, in exchange for filibuster reform, they'll stop ""filling the tree"" and filing so many amendments that Republicans can't get votes on enough of their own. They see the argument changing depending on how much power they have, and they see it being sold pretty poorly. This isn't a problem for House Republicans. Democrats are trying their damnedest to find hypocrisy in the new GOP. On Tuesday, incoming Majority Leader Eric Cantor suggested that disallowing amendments on the health care repeal bill would be all right, even though Republicans decried the restrictive amendment process under Democrats, because health care repeal had ""been litigated in the election."" Phil Kerpen, the national policy director of Americans for Prosperity, had rallied conservatives against ""deem and pass,"" the lame duck session, and numerous other outrages in 2010. He didn't see a problem with the Ryan budget trick that aggrieved Van Hollen. ""It's a unique situation because the 111th Congress failed to pass a single appropriations bill and we're already into the next budget cycle,"" said Kerpen. ""This is cleanup work so we can turn the page, and I believe the new GOP majority will make good on its promise to emphasize regular order and run the House in a more open fashion."" The base is OK with what Republicans are doing in the House, which is one reason why they will succeed. Conservatives are still more organized to save the filibuster than liberals are organized to stop it. On Tuesday, they suggested that Democrats would give up on filibuster reform because they see the possibility of losing the Senate in 2012 and losing their ability to stop the GOP from repealing their achievements. Of course, being good at something isn't the same as being right about it. According to Krissah Thompson, the key organizers at Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks have convinced themselves that the health care repeal vote happening in the House next week won't be symbolic--it will be the first part of ""a one-two punch"" to repeal. This is obviously wrong, because there's no math that gets the repeal caucus to 60 Senate votes to break a filibuster. What would put Republicans in a better position? Well, filibuster reform would. If New Mexico Democrat Tom Udall's version of reform succeeded, the 60-vote threshold wouldn't matter as much. Democrats could be ground down, over time, in successive votes. In 2013, if everything broke the GOP's way, repeal could happen with 51 votes in the Senate. It won't happen with the filibuster staggering along as it is now, though. All of the power grabs of 2011, and the balance of power won't shift at all. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

If he's in a hurry, he's winning. He has no time for grip-and-grins with voters and no interest in letting a reporter trap him in a gaffe. He has to be somewhere. The guy who sticks around does not have to be somewhere. Michael Steele did not have to be somewhere Monday. He'd just finished a debate at the National Press Club in Washington with the four people challenging him for the chairmanship of the Republican National Committee. He dived into a scrum of reporters and answered questions (""Were you expecting tougher questions from your rivals today?""). The scrum dissolved, but Steele stuck around, schmoozing with allies and Tea Party supporters. Weekly Standard reporter John McCormack, seeing an opening, asked Steele about the support his RNC had given to territories like Guam, instead of competitive states or congressional districts. This was what people liked to mention when they asked how Steele had managed to leave the RNC $20 million in debt. ""Why do you think it's a zero sum game?"" Steele huffed. ""Tell me what election we lost because I gave $15,000 to Guam?"" He gripped McCormack's arms, a sort of friendly, conversation-ending gesture. ""You do the research, and you come back and ask me that question!"" McCormack, somewhat amazed that the chairman was debating this, kept asking about the money that could have gone to closer races. ""We won those close races,"" said Steele. ""A 70-year record!"" said Holly Hughes, a Michigan Republican committeewoman who was shadowing Steele. Her job might have been done by RNC communications director Doug Heye or Steele chief of staff Michael Leavitt, except that both are leaving the RNC. ""We won. The bottom line is we won. Sixty-four seats,"" said Steele. ""So you wanted 65?"" ""I think some Republicans would have wanted 65,"" said McCormack. ""Yeah, but we couldn't count to 39 a year ago!"" said Steele. Steele had been less talkative in recent weeks. He limited his recent interactions with the media to a less-than-brutal interview with Fox's Greta Van Susteren (sample question: ""Why are some gunning for you?""). Now he's likely to get a lot more time to talk. On Jan. 14, 168 RNC members will vote for a chairman to carry them through the 2012 elections. According to a Politico analysis published hours before today's debate, 88 of the 168 members will not vote to re-elect Steele. Only about a dozen members showed up to the debate, and Steele received tepid applause from them. Ed Cox, the Republican chairman in New York, says he soured on Steele after Steele told him that Michael Faulkner, the GOP's challenger to embattled Rep. Charlie Rangel, was only four points down in internal polls. ""We acted on that,"" said Cox. ""We used some resources on that race."" But Rangel won with 81 percent of the vote. ""Whether the chairman just got the facts wrong, I don't know,"" said Cox, who is now backing Bush administration veteran Maria Cino over Steele Steele won the RNC chairmanship in 2009 despite nagging suspicions about his executive skills. At the candidate debate that year, held in the same room, Steele supporters hoisted campaign signs. Those signs repurposed the logo from his failed 2006 U.S. Senate bid--the name ""Steele,"" drawn to look like metal bolted into blue paper. The design suggested not that Steele could run a massive organization, but that he was a dynamic political celebrity, which in January 2009 sounded fantastic. Now Steele's opponents are promising to be the anti-Steele.  Reince Priebus, the youthful-looking chairman of the Wisconsin GOP and the contender with the most public endorsements, talked repeatedly and endlessly about how well his party had worked with Tea Party activists. * Michigan committeeman Saul Anuzis described how his party had stopped thousands of absentee ballots from being used in a voter-fraud scheme. Maria Cino took a shot at Steele by comparing his tenure to her time as the RNC's top political strategist in 2004, when it was well-funded and winning. ""When we sent 350 volunteers to the state of Ohio in 2004, that's what pushed us over the top,"" she said. Steele raised his hand to defend himself. ""I think it's a little bit frustrating to hear people talk about fully funding the program,"" said Steele. ""You're right. We didn't have that many volunteers coming out of Washington. We had 200,000 volunteers across the country making millions of calls."" This, to RNC members who felt the 72-hour pre-election strategy had collapsed since 2004 and 2006, was nonsense. Steele had shown a lot more contrition about RNC mistakes in the past. On Monday, he admitted nothing. When moderators asked the contenders what the GOP's biggest mistake of the past decade was, Steele started talking about the party's failure to win nonwhite voters--the very thing he'd pledged to fix when he got this gig. ""We are the party of Lincoln,"" said Steele. ""We are the party that understands the value of the individual. ... When we stop talking to our friends in the Hispanic community, and we made assumptions like, 'Oh, they won't vote for us anyway,' we lose."" If Steele's about to lose this job, he wants people to know he was right all along, the whole time he's had it.

""One day,"" he wrote, ""people who refuse to bet on their statements will be viewed with greater contempt than those who bet and lose."" He was talking about pundit accountability, a beautiful concept that will never be adopted, because no one wants to look stupid, and that's the inevitable result of any such plan. Guess how many jobs the stimulus will create--then eat your words when it falls short! Confidently predict where Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction are hidden--and, well, get a book deal and a first printing of 500,000. But that's sort of the point: There is no real downside, at least in Washington, for being wrong. In 2010, I wrote hundreds of thousands of words for multiple publications. I wrote more words, in 140-character increments, on Twitter. I said a bunch of stuff on television and radio and in speeches. How'd I do with my own predictions? Not terrible! Because I report more than pontificate, almost nothing I wrote or said was based on pure speculation. When I bobbled a prediction, it was because I was praying to the God of Sensational Headlines--usually the kind that end in question marks--or being goaded into Caplan-esque bets on Twitter. I developed a habit of predicting the final winners of elections on the night candidates were nominated, or the seats became open, such as ""Congratulations, Sen. Richard Blumenthal"" or ""Congratulations, Sen. Joe Manchin."" Fewer elections in 2011 means less of that and more attention to the big-picture stuff. Like this.Jan. 5: The Scott Brown DreamWhen I started calling around to see whether Scott Brown had a shot at Ted Kennedy's vacated Senate seat, no one bought it. ""I think the odds are still against Brown in a way that they were not necessarily against [Doug] Hoffman,"" said Erick Erickson of RedState. ""Brown could get elected in Mississippi, but not Massachusetts,"" said Mary Ann Marsh, a Massachusetts Democratic strategist. I was more bullish on Brown's chances, but I underestimated one thing: the degree to which voters in the state opposed the health care bill. ""A September 2009 poll conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health and the Boston Globe,"" I wrote, ""found voters supportive of the state's health care reform--a mandate that conservatives compare to the plan moving through Capitol Hill--by a 37-point margin."" The poll wasn't wrong, but one reason Massachusetts opposed the federal law was that voters worried it would muck with their own plan. It was a preview of the backlashes to come, and it took me too long to realize that the bill was not going to get popular in a hurry. March 23: Health Care Lawsuits? Good Luck!The night that health care reform passed the House, I stood under a balcony and listened to Rep. Michele Bachmann promise full repeal by any means necessary. Since then, I've taken it seriously when Republicans come up with ways to undo Obamacare. But I was skeptical at first of the lawsuits filed by state attorneys general, aimed at repealing the mandate portion of the bill. ""Ambitious Republican politicians are clambering on board with the idea of lawsuits to repeal the health care individual mandate,"" I wrote, ""even though the chances of repeal are slim."" Ken Cuccinelli was not listening to me. April 16: D.C. Might Get a Vote in CongressCharlie Brown's football game was less depressing than the perennial, doomed effort of Washington activists to get the district some congressional representation. Conservatives and liberals, Republicans and Democrats--everyone expected some kind of compromise to get jammed through. For most of the year, the district's nonvoting delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton, was confident that liberals would swallow a compromise bill that gave D.C. a vote while repealing the city's strict gun control laws. ""We're expecting the long-dormant D.C. voting rights bill to rise again once Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., settles on gun-rights language that the city could handle,"" I wrote. Of course, as it always does, the deal fell apart. The district's best chance for representation--Democratic Congress, Democratic president--disappeared. Oct. 1: Jason Chaffetz Will Run the Congressional Committee Overseeing the District of ColumbiaUntil December, this prediction was practically mundane. It was reporting what Chaffetz said would likely happen: Republicans would win control of Congress, and he would move up from ranking Republican to chairman of the committee that oversees the nation's capital. The problem was that Chaffetz, one of the stars of the GOP's 2008 class, was given a bigger assignment by Rep. Darrell Issa--oversight of TARP and Homeland Security--and the anti-gay marriage, pro-vouchers Chaffetz stopped scaring D.C. liberals so much. Aug. 5: The Lamest DuckIn the summer and fall of the campaign season, Tea Partiers and Republican candidates warned that Democrats would use the final, lame duck session of Congress to pass all sorts of terrifying bills. Cap-and-trade! Card-check! Permanent tax increases! Immigration amnesty! Dogs and cats, living together, married in Massachusetts! Instead, I reported that ""Republican aides I talked to admitted that the lame-duck session's agenda was likely to be non-controversial and would probably handle whatever routine business that the blundering 111th Congress couldn't finish in September."" This was 90 percent right and 10 percent wrong. Nothing that Republicans warned about got to the floor. The tax cut compromise that passed was better for conservatives than the increase that would have occurred if no lame duck was held. But it was a busy session, far from bland. April to October: The Saga of Joe MillerI think I was the first Washington reporter to take seriously the insurgent campaign of a former magistrate and failed state Senate candidate running against Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski. On April 29, I quoted Miller saying that he'd have a big endorsement ""in the papers"" the next week. The endorsement was from Todd Palin; later, his wife endorsed Miller. Instant Tea Party credibility. Then, as the primary date approached, I went wobbly. Miller was running a shoddy campaign, and polls said he'd lose. He won the primary. Fortunately for Murkowski, and for my credibility, he kept running a shoddy campaign. By October, I was calling him the ""Incredible Shrinking Joe Miller,"" and today, finally, the state has certified the election for Murkowski. And I'm outta here. I'll be back next year with a much shorter list. What did you get wrong in 2010? Send me your confessions, or put on a hairshirt and go into the comments. Like Slate on  Facebook.

21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/12/in_christie_we_trust.html	"In two weeks, Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina will become the first chairman of the new House oversight subcommittee on TARP, Financial Services, and Bailouts of Public and Private Programs. In the meantime, he is thinking about New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who was on 60 Minutes this Sunday talking about the need to cut state spending and trim state employees and their pensions. ""You look at his stuff--and, granted, he puts his good stuff on YouTube--but he is so blunt about what the state's facing,"" says McHenry. ""There's one video I've seen where he's talking to a teacher. And the teacher's like, 'We work so hard.' "" McHenry does his best imitation of the pathos in the teacher's voice. ""Christie says, 'You know what? You don't have to do it.' "" McHenry sits back, holding out his hands in a ""can you believe this?"" gesture. ""You watch that, and you think--that's a governor. And that's a teacher. The teacher always wins, man!"" It's a popular Republican belief--in New Jersey, in D.C., everywhere else--that the success of the governor of New Jersey is proving that spending cuts and austerity are no longer the stuff of Heritage Foundation daydreams. Christie is balancing some fee increases with painful cuts, and selling this by dressing down Democrats and union leaders. There's a debate to have about Christie, how effective he is, and how truly popular he is. There's no debate anymore that Republicans want to follow his model. In January 2011, some number of Republican congressmen are planning to issue an ultimatum to states: There will be no additional aid, and you have to balance your budgets. ""I'm going to introduce a resolution when the new Congress begins, stating that the House will not bail out state budgets,"" says Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah. ""The message is: States, don't think the federal government is going to bail you out. Pay attention to this now."" McHenry is one of several congressmen who'll be empowered to demand transparency from states, especially on the shortfalls in their pension funds. This is something that public-employee unions see as a coordinated attack on their members, but Republicans say the unions are going to lose. ""The potential here,"" says McHenry, ""is that we're facing a generational shift based on economic realities, based on our expectations for government, on what government does, and how government delivers services."" For evidence of this, Republicans can look at polling in Christie's state. According to the Nov. 11 Quinnipiac Poll, a survey that's conducted in the state every few months, voters who were asked about how to bring the budget in line favored service cuts over tax hikes by a 36-point margin. On every budget question, voters agree with Christie. Seventy-eight percent of voters want public workers to have their wages frozen, 63 percent want them furloughed, and 54 percent of voters are in favor of just laying them off. Personally, Christie is fairly popular. He was elected with slightly less than 50 percent support; he hovers around 50 percent support. The important thing is that he's stayed at that level by making cuts and warning that he needs to make more on the backs of public workers. Support for a public worker wage freeze is up seven points since Christie was inaugurated. The belief that the teachers' unions are ""playing a negative role in improving New Jersey's educational system"" is up from a nine-point margin when Christie was inaugurated to an 18-point margin now. That convinces Republicans that they can take on unions and win. It warns union leaders that they can lose. After 60 Minutes ran its segment on the ""day of reckoning"" (a Christie term) facing states that didn't cut back public employee pensions, the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees blasted the ""one-sided report"" and union president Gerald W. McEntee argued pensions weren't such a big part of the problem. ""The challenge can be met if state and local governments began contributing just 1.5 percent more of their budgets toward their pension funds in the years ahead."" Republicans intend to prove this wrong. In December, when it had no chance of passage but plenty of time to draw attention, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., introduced the Public Employee Pension Transparency Act. (It was co-sponsored by Paul Ryan and Darrell Issa, the incoming chairman of Budget and Oversight.) That legislation would require public employee pension plans to change the way they report their finances. The reason? Republicans believe that these pension data are based on rosy assumptions that aren't relevant anymore. They also believe they called the pension funds' bluff. On Friday, Dec. 17, the president of the National Association of State Retirement Administrators e-mailed members to warn that the introduction of Nunes' bill marked ""the beginning of a series of coordinated articles, reports and continuous media coverage falsely asserting state and local governments are a financial wreck and are not accurately accounting for the fiscal condition of their pension plans."" What could the pension fund people and the public sector unions be so worried about? Right-leaning Reuters columnist James Pethokoukis laid it out for them. If the states aren't bailed out, they're going to have to start cutting budgets. If there's total transparency about pension funds--and voters are already in the mood to shave the benefits and numbers of public workers--then that's where you can cut. Republicans might even be able to pass legislation that would allow states to declare bankruptcy, which would move the pension debate from politics to court, zapping all of the unions' leverage. ""From the Republican perspective,"" wrote Pethokoukis, ""the fiscal crisis on the state level provides a golden opportunity to defund a key Democratic interest group."" How would that work, exactly? House Republicans aren't talking about it yet. But Newt Gingrich, who those Republicans take seriously, laid it out clearly in a Nov. 11 speech to the Institute for Policy Innovation. ""I also hope the House Republicans are going to move a bill in the first month or so of their tenure to create a venue for state bankruptcy,"" said Gingrich, ""so that states like California and New York and Illinois that think they're going to come to Washington for money can be told, you know, you need to sit down with all your government employee unions and look at their health plans and their pension plans and frankly if they don't want to change, our recommendation is you go into bankruptcy court and let the bankruptcy judge change it, and I would make the federal bankruptcy law prohibit tax increases as part of the solution, so no bankruptcy judge could impose a tax increase on the people of the states."" So: Patrick McHenry will run a key subcommittee with oversight over all bailouts, present and potential. He thinks Republicans have an opening to fix a ""potentially explosive"" situation with pension funds. Is he onboard with the state bankruptcy idea? He holds his cards close. ""It ain't easy,"" he says, ""but we have to face reality."" Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	House Republicans are ready for war against public sector unions.
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/12/no_joke.html	"In the never-ending debate about whether Jon Stewart is a comedian with opinions or an activist who happens to make jokes, he's always argued for the former. When Tucker Carlson accused Stewart of liberal hackery on Crossfire in 2004, Stewart famously played the joker card. ""You're on CNN,"" he said. ""The show that leads into me is puppets making crank phone calls."" It's true--Stewart leans left, but the jokes always come first. At October's Rally To Restore Sanity, which many observers considered his coming-out party as the anti-Glenn Beck, Stewart was careful not to cross the line into advocacy. He didn't even tell people to vote. He's just not ""in the game,"" he told Rachel Maddow in an interview in November. ""I'm in the stands yelling things, criticizing."" Last week, Stewart stepped onto the field. The change came after Senate Republicans blocked a bill that would provide $7.4 billion in medical benefits to firefighters, police officers, and health workers who got sick from working at Ground Zero on and after 9/11. Stewart didn't just mock the 42 Republicans who refused to consider the bill until the Bush tax cuts were extended. He ripped them apart. ""I can't wait for them to take to the floor to talk about why their party hates first responders,"" he said. He shredded Sen. Mike Enzi's argument that the bill would lead to waste, fraud, and abuse by pointing to Enzi's support for corruption-riddled spending in Iraq. Last week, he did a follow-up segment, ""Worst Responders,"" in which he called the refusal to pass the 9/11 bill ""an outrageous abdication of our responsibility to those who were most heroic on 9/11."" The bill would even be paid for by closing corporate tax loopholes. ""It's a win-win-win-win-just [bleep] do it!"" he yelled. He also blasted the media for failing to cover the story, noting that the only cable news network to devote a full segment to the issue was Al Jazeera. He then interviewed four first responders--a fireman, a police officer, a Department of Transportation worker, and an engineer--who suffered illnesses as a result of their work at Ground Zero. The segment had funny moments. But the jokes didn't come first. And it worked. After Stewart's tirade, other networks started to cover the story. On Fox News, Shepard Smith called the Republican obstruction ""shameful."" ABC News noted that Democrats haven't exactly been pushing hard to pass the legislation. Rachel Maddow ran a long Daily Show clip and praised Stewart for doing a ""great service."" Now, with the hours ticking away before winter recess, Congress seems poised to pass a bill, with its top boosters, New York Sens. Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, announcing that ""the finish line ... is in sight."" So let me get this straight. Jon Stewart is ""just a comedian,"" yet he managed to single-handedly fast-track a left-for-dead bill through the U.S. Congress in a matter of days? Not quite. The bill wasn't as far from passage as it seemed--Stewart just shined a light on the issue at the right moment. In early December, Republicans blocked the bill because of the tax deal. After the tax package passed on Friday, Dec. 17, Democrats were finally able to discuss the 9/11 bill with the GOP. Republicans didn't object to giving benefits to 9/11 workers, they said. They just didn't like the way it was paid for. So senators rejiggered the payment mechanisms--it would have been covered by closing a corporate tax loophole; now it will be paid for mainly with a 2 percent fee on federal contracts awarded to foreign countries that don't allow U.S. businesses to compete--and brought the cost of the bill down from $7.4 billion to $6.2 billion, after which Republicans were more willing to get onboard. John Feal, founder of the FealGood Foundation who connected Stewart with the first responders who came on the show, says moving the bill toward passage has been a team effort. But he credits Stewart for its recent progress: ""What Jon Stewart did was he literally shamed conventional media and the U.S. government into doing the right thing."" Stewart would probably argue that pushing for 9/11 workers comp--9/11 workers comp, for Chrissake!--isn't taking a political stance. It's taking a stance for decency, heroism, and the American people. Indeed, he called it ""the Least-We-Can-Do-No-Brainer Act of 2010."" But stripped of the funny, that sounds a lot like what a politician would say. So did Stewart's cheap shot about Mitch McConnell crying over the departure of his friend Sen. Judd Gregg--but not, Stewart seemed to suggest, about 9/11. Republicans may have had a flimsy case for blocking the bill, and Stewart rightly mocked the GOP for failing to help 9/11 workers after milking the tragedy all these years, but by shaming them in the name of 9/11 workers, he was engaging in demagoguery himself. It may have been for a good cause, but it was political demagoguery all the same. Stewart has shown ambivalence about whether to insert himself into the political arena. When Rachel Maddow argued in an interview with Stewart last month that they both had political agendas, Stewart disagreed. The difference, he told Maddow, is that ""You're in the game."" Stewart said that at the Rally to Restore Sanity,"	By pushing for the 9/11 first responders health bill, Jon Stewart steps onto the political playing field.
23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/12/how_slate_readers_think_obama_ticks.html	"Last week I offered my choices for five of the most revealing moments of the Obama presidency. We could all probably come up with five gaffes or ""defining"" moments or gaffes for the highlight reel (one might be this week's deal on tax cuts). But what I was trying to find were the moments that hinted at a larger truth about Obama, many of which would not be included in those other obvious lists. I asked readers to respond with their suggestions, and you did. Here are your offerings: 1) News conference July 22, 2009: In the final answer of this session, the president weighed in on the arrest of Professor Henry Louis Gates of Harvard, an African-American. ""Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof he was in own home. ... What I think we know separate and apart from this incident is that there's a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately,"" Obama said. ""That's just a fact."" I had always thought of this answer as bad message discipline: The purpose of the press conference was to talk about health care. By weighing in on this controversy, Obama made the story bigger and inserted himself into it. It's not often that Obama suffers a lapse like this; lack of discipline is not one of Obama's core qualities. A faithful correspondent made a larger case for why it was revealing: ""The tone and substance of his remarks are of a piece with the tone and substance of his comments about Republican 'hostage takers' and 'bombthrowers'  and 'sanctimonious' Democrats,"" my correspondent writes. ""He has a willingness to rhetorically characterize the motives and behaviors of people who disagree with him."" 2) House Republican retreat, Jan. 29, 2010: I hadn't included this on the list because while I think the president's conversation with House Republicans was great theater and a strong performance by the president, it didn't tell us much that we didn't already know about him. It's not that surprising that Obama could give a strong performance in a public setting. It also didn't change the political dynamic much, though it certainly heartened his boosters. Readers suggested this dialogue did tell us something, though, because it was the first time we saw the president in public demonstrating how well briefed he was on the substance of economic and health care policy. 3) Meeting with congressional leaders, Jan. 23, 2009: The president, in a debate with House Minority Whip Eric Cantor over the shape of stimulus legislation, is reported to have said, ""I won."" For Republicans, the moment revealed that there were severe limitations to how much he was willing to work with the opposition. For Democrats, the moment was an early sign that his pledges to cooperate did not mean he would be a pushover. 4) Remarks in Charlotte, N.C., April 2, 2010: During a question-and-answer session with workers at an advanced battery plant, a woman said she was ""overtaxed,"" and the president responded with a speech. He went on for 17 minutes, offering more than 2,500 words, covering everything from the deficit to congressional budget rules to Federal Medical Assistance percentages. Thus did the president show the downside of one the things people liked about his performance with the House Republicans: his command of detail. In Charlotte, he knew a lot--and he couldn't stop showing it. Meanwhile, he wasn't really communicating with the voter who stood before him.

24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/12/one_last_bite_of_pork.html	"In his 2008 presidential campaign, John McCain had a line about senators who earmarked spending bills, and he repeated it like a Zen koan: ""I will make them famous,"" he said, ""and you will know their names. You will know their names!"" McCain's campaign could have gone better in a number of ways. But that part of his campaign--that promise--has been fulfilled. On Wednesday, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Tex., and Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., became famous. They held a morning presser on the $1.2 trillion omnibus spending bill introduced by Democrats, made inevitable by Congress's failure to pass a budget or individual appropriations bills. ""I think this is an outrage,"" said Cornyn. ""But more than being outraged, I think it demonstrates profound disrespect for the American people. The senators and congressmen who are going to be leaving and will never be held politically accountable for this spending, I think, are showing disrespect for those of us left behind to try and clean up the mess."" Cue the mess. Thanks to legislation passed in 2006, and cosponsored by now-President Barack Obama, the names of all senators and representatives who requested earmarks are published in charts made available the same time that the text of spending bills are made available. Reporters, presented with this data, dug through and counted up the earmarks requested by Thune and Cornyn, then asked the senators how it was possible for them to be anti-earmark when they'd requested so many earmarks for projects in their states. ""Those projects were projects that were vetted,"" said Thune. ""I mean, I support those projects. But I don't support this bill, nor do I support the process by which this bill was put together. Most of us voted for a resolution in our conference that [said] we would not support earmarks."" Thune allowed himself a laugh at the mounting absurdity of this. ""My way of expressing that is to vote against this legislation."" He was asked why he didn't just take his earmarks out. ""We're going to try and vote this thing down. I don't know how you get 'em out now other than amending the bill."" As far as the anti-earmark movement is concerned, he could have stopped at ""I support these projects."" ""Oh, those poor people!"" said Citizens Against Government Waste's Leslie Paige, speaking through phony tears. ""They're being forced to get their earmarks funded! We see a little cognitive dissonance here. It's a bit dispiriting and it's transparent to us what's going on."" Everyone here was playing his or her part in the life cycle of the earmark outrage. It was a little different last year. There was no intra-Republican pledge not to request earmarks. But there was outrage, followed by a vote that pushed through the bill and its earmarks--then, as now, around 0.8 percent of the budget. There was a disappointed president announcing that the omnibus and the earmarks were necessary one last time. ""I expect future spending bills to be debated and voted on in an orderly way and sent to my desk without delay or obstruction so that we don't face another massive, last-minute omnibus bill like this one,"" said Obama. ""This piece of legislation must mark an end to the old way of doing business and the beginning of a new era of responsibility and accountability that the American people have every right to expect and demand."" That didn't happen. The Democratic approach to earmarks hasn't changed much. The Republican approach, as demonstrated by Thune, Cornyn, and other Republicans whose requests appear in the omnibus, became a lot like that of Rep. Ron Paul. He requests earmarks, then votes against the spending bills containing the earmarks. If they vote against the omnibus, Thune and Cornyn will be doing just that. And this is where the ""making famous"" part comes in. Stopping Republicans from requesting earmarks started with a pledge, but it's enforced by shame and embarrassment. Since the 2008 election, McCain has found an ideal format for humiliating senators and generating stories for reporters who love tales of government waste or screwed-over-consumers. He tweets them. He, and all earmark opponents, look for the stupidest-sounding earmarks and rattle them off like fat jokes. The oddity today was that none of Cornyn or Thune's requests were particularly silly-sounding. Look at transportation funding. Thune requested $500,000 for ""Rapid City Regional Airport Terminal Expansion""; $750,000 for ""I-29/I-229 Bridges and Interstate Mainline Reconstruction From Near Tea Exit to North of 69th Street and East to Louise Avenue""; $150,000 for ""Ghost Hawk Road Improvements (BIA Route 7 to SD Hwy 18)""; $1 million for ""Improvements and 4 R Work to SD 73 in Jackson County""; and $400,000 for something called the ""Domestic Violence Building Project."" Cornyn requests include $750,000 for ""West Ninth Avenue Extension and Overpass Construction, Belton""; $1 million for the ""VIA Fredericksburg Road Bus Rapid Transit Corridor""; $3.5 million for ""Surface Transportation Improvements on U.S. 287 Business Route, Fort Worth""; $2 million for ""Loop 82 Railroad Overpass, San Marcos""; and $500,000 for ""the Denton Downtown Improvement Project to upgrade the streets and streetscape."" After this year, under the Republican pledge, Republican senators won't even be permitted to request boring-sounding civic improvements like these. The Ron Paul strategy of high-minded hypocrisy will work for Ron Paul, but not them. Try it, and get embarrassed by the press, just like what happened today. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., who co-sponsored (and really championed) that 2006 transparency legislation with Obama, made an Excel spreadsheet of earmarks available on his Web site. In doing so, he warned that it only would help citizens discover the ""disclosed"" earmarks and not the ""billions in undisclosed earmarks."" And if you don't disclose, you can't become famous.

25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/12/bipartisanship_now.html	"Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., was angry, with an emphasis on ""was."" Last week she told the Huffington Post that a tax-rate deal that benefited the wealthiest among us represented ""moral corruptness."" On Friday, she joined Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for a lengthy filibuster-of-sorts, using some debate time to pound the podium once again about moral corruption. Yet on Monday, in a conversation with reporters before the vote on whether to let the tax deal proceed, Landrieu appeared calm. ""I wasn't outraged about the bill,"" Landrieu said. ""What was I outraged about?"" ""You were describing the deal that had been struck,"" said Huffington Post's Arthur Delaney. ""Not the whole deal,"" said Landrieu. ""I was outraged about one portion of the deal. And I'm still outraged about it."" Landrieu counted off the tax-rate cuts that would benefit ""the families of millionaires"" and said the negotiators never should have included them. ""That is what I object to. I did not say I was against the whole package."" Less than an hour later, Landrieu voted to let debate continue on the tax deal. Sanders and Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, who had also spoken during the ""filiBernie,"" voted no, but nine Democrats and five Republicans ditched them and joined Landrieu for an overall vote of 83-14. Their votes make final passage of the deal all but certain. But that didn't mean senators couldn't still take swipes at the bill before helping to move it along. ""It is almost an Orwellian experience here on the floor of the United States Senate, as compared to the rest of America,"" said Arizona Sen. John McCain shortly before the vote began. ""Rather than just extend the tax breaks, which is what the majority of Americans say they want, this bill includes un-needed, unwanted, unnecessary sweeteners to, I guess, get votes."" The bill, he said, extended tax breaks for ethanol and dozens of other special projects. ""This is precisely the same business-as-usual behavior that Republicans told Tea Party voters they wouldn't engage in!"" That drew an immediate rebuke from Iowa's Chuck Grassley, whose state has more to gain from ethanol tax breaks than Arizona and who argued that keeping the ethanol tax break was only one of many kludges in the bill. ""I don't quite understand,"" said Grassley, ""when there's 72 provisions in this bill that are expiring, how somebody today is going to say that's bad tax policy."" The ethanol break was necessary, he said. ""God only made so much fossil fuel!"" Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe, who has opposed ethanol tax breaks in the past, held his nose and voted for the deal. ""People talk about the wind and ethanol subsidies,"" Inhofe said, ""but you're talking about 0.3 percent and 1.7 percent of the total. That's a pretty good deal, a lot better than I thought would ever be struck."" It's inevitably awkward when Democratic senators line up to vote for what was originally a Republican policy. The people who claim to speak for the bases of both parties had, slowly, come around to the opinion that the deal was a loser for all concerned. Liberal pundits, the AFL-CIO, and MoveOn have attacked the deal as a sell-out; the hyperactive Progressive Change Campaign Committee has bought some ads in Iowa going after Obama for caving. Conservative groups such as the Club for Growth, RedState, and the Tea Party Patriots had all opposed the deal. Charles Krauthammer used hisWashington Post column to call the deal a ""swindle."" The opposition that might have worried senators the most came from Moody's. On Monday, the rating agency warned that the United States was looking at a bond-rating downgrade if a tax deal that wasn't paid for was signed into law. That was exactly the sort of problem that pushed Democrats to demand an end to the Bush tax cuts and Republicans to threaten to block a rise in the debt ceiling. That's all for later. Democrats promoted the deal by echoing the White House, warning that failure to move the tax deal ahead would throw the economy into a recession. Plus, they argue, they extracted good concessions from the GOP. ""On unemployment insurance, they've adopted our policies,"" said Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey. ""Wholly! Completely! The combined effect will be very positive for jobs, and I cite Mark Zandi and some others on that."" When I mentioned that the economist Zandi's endorsement of the stimulus package was derided by many conservatives, Casey said, ""I don't think there's any doubt that the stimulus was 3 million jobs."" Utah Republican Sen. Bob Bennett, who has three weeks left in the Senate--he was famously beaten by Tea Partiers in the GOP primary--announced his own support for the deal, then unwrapped a miniature Snickers bar and chewed as reporters tried to draw him out. ""The tax deal was carefully constructed, and I'm in favor of it,"" Bennett said. When National Review's Robert Costa nudged him about the subsidies in the bill, Bennett repeated himself: ""The tax deal was carefully crafted and carefully put together and I'm in favor of it.""

26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/12/congratulations_now_shut_up.html	"On Wednesday afternoon, Rep. Ron Paul met with Rep. Spencer Bachus, the incoming chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. Paul hated TARP, the 2008 program that bailed out the financial sector, and voted against it. Bachus had voted for TARP, and to get his new job he'd defeated Ed Royce, who voted against TARP. Still, Paul had supported Bachus. The two of them talked briefly, agreed that they could keep working together, and, just like that, any doubt that Paul would get to run the monetary policy subcommittee fell away. Paul started to spread the news to his staff, who'd heard the rumors that he might be denied the job despite seniority putting him in line for it. Andrew Napolitano, who hosts a show on Fox Business and books Paul and his senator-elect son whenever humanly possible, started beseeching Paul to come on and break his news. Can I have it? he asked. Can I have it? He got it, and on Wednesday Paul announced the news that would not become official for 14 hours. And then Paul started to criticize his fellow Republicans for considering ways to define WikiLeaks as a terrorist organization instead of a journalistic one. ""Doesn't that remind you of 1984,"" asked Paul, referring to the Orwell novel, ""when language becomes pretty vital?"" It was classic Ron Paul. Shortly after getting the job he's wanted for decades--oversight of the Federal Reserve--he was comparing Julian Assange to Winston Smith. When the midterms were over, with the corpses of Democratic incumbents still being counted and labeled, conservatives and Tea Party activists went after the Republicans in line to take over key committees. They opposed Michigan Rep. Fred Upton's bid to run Energy and Commerce. They worked the phones against Hal Rogers of Kentucky, a ""prince of pork"" in line to run Appropriations. They backed outsiders to run Banking, the Republican Study Committee, and the Conference Committee. They lost all of these fights, which means that of all the committee fights that activists were watching, the only one they definitively won was Ron Paul's. If you, like Paul, have spent most of your life arguing that the Federal Reserve is bad for the country and too secretive to boot, this is fantastic news. In a Thursday interview with Bloomberg News, Paul previewed his agenda and suggested that using the committee to educate America about the Fed and expose the threat of quantitative easing was exactly what voters wanted Congress to do. ""Obviously, it is very popular with the American people to audit the Fed and know what they're doing when they can spend trillions of dollars and we don't know where it goes,"" said Paul. ""They have a bigger budget; they spend more money than Congress does. Yet, we have no oversight."" In fact, a Bloomberg poll released on Thursday found that 55 percent of Americans wanted the Fed ""held more accountable"" or ""abolished."" Support for simply abolishing the Fed, as Paul wants to do, had doubled from 8 percent to 16 percent in just two months. And yet there are libertarians who consider the Paul takeover in open-mouthed horror, a poor consolation for the elevation of Rogers and Upton. ""Republicans stashed him in this job because they don't want him making more important decisions,"" said Megan McArdle, a prominent libertarian blogger and economics editor of the Atlantic. ""He cares passionately about monetary policy, which most Republicans don't care about. But when you look at his speeches, he doesn't understand anything about monetary policy. He might actually understand it less than the average member of Congress. My personal opinion is that he wastes all of his time on the House Financial Services Committee ranting crazily."" Paul-phobia is almost as old as Paul-mania, especially among libertarians. The anti-Paul case consists of one simple argument--he sounds crazy--and one complex argument, which is that he's distracted libertarians and Tea Partiers by focusing their ire on the easily demonized Fed. Both of those factors were epitomized in February 2010, when he confronted Ben Bernanke with the allegation that the Fed ""facilitated a $5.5 billion loan to Saddam Hussein and he then bought weapons from our military industrial complex"" in the 1980s. Paul would later explain what he meant, but Bernanke used the moment to dress him down. ""Well, Congressman,"" said Bernanke, ""these specific allegations you've made I think are absolutely bizarre, and I have absolutely no knowledge of anything remotely like what you just described."" That incident and incidents like it make the Paul skeptics cringe about what he'll do next. ""I don't think he's often the best messenger for the things he believes in,"" said Mark Calabria, director of financial regulation studies at the Cato Institute and a six-year veteran of the Senate Banking Committee. ""I give the guy credit for bringing the Fed under the spotlight, but the real credit probably goes to the Fed for making enough mistakes to make us interested in them. Does Paul approach this in a way that helps his own cause? That's not a guarantee, necessarily. He needs to avoid going down the path to conspiracy theories and keep the focus on economics."" Paul's cheering section has gotten used to that, and they're past it now. In 2007 and 2008, the world of libertarian economists and pundits were pretty evenly divided over whether his presidential campaign and its obsession with the Federal Reserve were doing good for the movement. Paul's supporters mocked his opponents as the ""Kochtopus,"" the small-minded and well-funded elitists looking down on the movement's best spokesman from perches at Cato, the Mercatus Center, and Reason magazine. (I'm a contributing editor of Reason.) But the criticism is more muted now. There's more excitement about what Paul will pull off now that he finally has a gavel. ""Paul's commentary on, and cross-examination of, the Federal Reserve has only seemed less crazy with the passage of time,"" said Matt Welch, editor-in-chief of Reason. ""It sounded crazy when he kept pestering Bernanke or whoever about whether the Fed was involved in various overseas bailouts. But then the Fed was involved in various overseas bailouts! By trying quixotically to End the Fed, he will succeed in doing more to audit the Fed, because there is a growing interest/concern in the post-TARP world about the unprecedented and not-very-well-controlled power that the institution has to do whatever it wants."" There are some libertarians, like McArdle, who worry about Paul's ability to shake the markets by creating uncertainty about the Fed. But Paul, who laid low in order to make sure he wouldn't miss a chance at this job, has given every indication that he'll use the committee as an educational tool and as a place for oversight. He is likely to move Paul Martin-Foss, an economist working for him now, over to the committee. His model for success is not his grilling of Bernanke. It's the ""Audit the Fed"" legislation that he championed in the House and that Bernie Sanders championed in the Senate--legislation that led to a report on the Fed's activity during the recession that surely has had something to do with the uptick in anti-Fed sentiment. ""My ideas are powerful, but I am not,"" said Paul in his Bloomberg interview. ""There is a committee chairman, speaker of the House. I am realistic and I know what that means. But I also know the strength of ideas, and that is what will prevail. It wasn't my political power that prevailed last year to get 320 co-sponsors of auditing the Fed. It was the power of the ideas. That is what they ought to worry about."" Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	Why Ron Paul's newfound power both pleases and worries libertarians.
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/12/dont_hate_the_playeror_the_game.html	"In poker, the cards dealt after the opening round of betting are called ""the flop."" In politics--at least when it comes to Harry Reid--it's called the flip-flop. Politico reported on Tuesday that Reid was trying to stuff President Obama's tax cuts package with a bill that would legalize online poker. (Reid has since backed off.) This wouldn't be such a big deal, except that Reid has opposed legalization in the past. What changed his mind? Could it be the hundreds of thousands of dollars Las Vegas casinos contributed to his re-election campaign? Yeah, probably. But that doesn't change the fact that legalizing online poker is long overdue. Let's start with the most obvious reason to permit online poker: It happens anyway. An estimated 7 million Americans already log on to poker sites every month, according to one study. But the sites they visit operate outside the purview of U.S. law because they're located offshore. That means players aren't protected from fraud or cheating. If they get fleeced by another player, their only recourse is to complain to the site. Gambling sites like Poker Stars and Full Tilt Poker are self-policing. If someone's perpetrating a fraud scheme, it's up to the sites to punish them. They usually do--after all, they want to protect their reputations--but it's not a foolproof system. When an employee at a site called Absolute Poker allegedly cracked the system and looked at everyone's cards, he was caught, but the money he won by cheating wasn't recouped. If one of the poker companies disappeared tomorrow and took all its customers' money with it, they'd have no recourse. Reid's bill would bring all this activity under the regulatory umbrella: Set up a licensing system, create standards for who can play, and enforce the rules. Legalizing the game would also raise tax revenues. The Joint Committee on Taxation scored an online gambling bill sponsored by Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., as generating $42 billion for the federal government over 10 years, and $30 billion for state and local governments. That's probably a little high, since it would legalize not just poker but all Internet gambling and since it assumes all 50 states opt in, says John Pappas, executive director of the Poker Players Alliance: ""I think more realistic is between $15 and $20 billion over a 10-year period."" That's not going to eliminate the deficit. But it's enough to make lawmakers look twice. Whatever the tax revenue, critics of online gambling argue that the social costs of legalization could be even higher. Chad Hills, a spokesman for Focus on the Family, pointed to an admittedly rough estimate that legalizing online gambling would create $25 billion annually in social costs--aggregate losses from bankruptcy, crime, and other negative impacts of gambling addiction. The simplest argument for online poker is the libertarian one: You should be able to do what you want in your home, as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else. But critics turn that argument on its head. The fact that online gambling is so accessible, they say, makes people all the more vulnerable. ""Online gambling brings casinos into your living room, into schools, into businesses and libraries,"" says Hills. It's true--increasing access to poker could create new problem gamblers. The Web also lessens the social pressures against gambling, like the shame of losing money or the friend who leans over and tells you it's time to quit. Critics also envision a world in which kids can get ahold of their parents' credit cards and gamble away their life savings. But, again--sorry to belabor this--this doesn't describe some freaky future. It describes the status quo. People who want to gamble online can and do without any oversight. If online gambling were regulated, it could have built-in safeguards. A player could set loss limits for himself beforehand, for example. Or sites could monitor betting patterns to detect problem gambling and warn bettors when they appear to be heading off the deep end. (Some sites already have these safeguards--but they're not required.) The Reid bill would also direct some of its tax revenue toward gambling addiction services. Of course there's no way to force players to stop playing--but, again, that's no different from Vegas. Current online gambling law is in shambles. The prevailing rule, the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, doesn't explicitly ban online gambling. It merely prohibits banks from allowing money transfers to and from sites engaged in ""unlawful Internet gambling."" But it doesn't define what ""unlawful Internet gambling"" is. Instead, it leaves banks to determine which transfers are legal and which ones aren't. Banks respond to that ambiguity by overregulating, just to be safe. The Department of Justice isn't much help, either.  DOJ has argued that online gambling is illegal under the 1961 Wire Act, but the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that interpretation in 2002, determining that the Wire Act covers only sports betting, not other kinds of gambling like poker. * A new online gambling bill would clear up the gray area by explicitly saying what's legal and what's not. Just to be clear: Reid isn't proposing to legalize all online gambling--only poker. It's a key distinction. Poker isn't a game of luck like slots. Luck plays a role, but skill is also involved. Betting on games that require skill is generally more protected by the law than games of luck. Even so, most states already allow games of luck. Forty-six states and jurisdictions have lotteries. Almost every state permits some combination of casinos, horse racing, or dog racing. Poker advocates get all romantic when talking about their favorite pastime. It's part of our great nation's history, the fabric of our culture. Our president plays it, for heaven's sake. But they also have a vested interest in legalizing the game online. ""There would be a huge influx of casual players, of fish,"" says one Washington-based professional poker player who asked not to be named because his primary source of income--online poker--may not be legal. ""It would be really good for me from a financial standpoint.""Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter.

28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/12/forced_march.html	"President Obama rallies the base in two ways: by lifting them up, and lecturing them. An example of the first approach is his address last spring to House Democrats before the health care reform vote, when he talked of the common spark that led all of them to public service. The second approach was evident at his news conference today. Appearing exasperated at times, Obama tried to explain (again) why he had to make the deal on tax cuts with Republicans. It was a public event, but it felt like a closed-circuit address to the Democratic caucus. When he repeated his reasoning, you could occasionally hear his implied salutation: ""You numbskulls."" Liberals want president Obama to fight, and he is--against them. He doesn't get why they don't see the political reality of the situation: Taxes will go up for everyone if he doesn't make this deal. The economy will buckle. Families will suffer. He can't gamble that Republicans will make any last-minute concessions. He has to act. ""I have not been able to budge them,"" Obama said of the Republicans. ""And I don't think there's any suggestion anybody in this room thinks, realistically, that we can budge them right now. And in the meantime there are a whole bunch of people being hurt. And the economy would be damaged. And my first job is to make sure the economy is growing, that we're creating jobs out there, and that people who are struggling are getting some relief."" When debating with Republicans, the president uses tough rhetoric, and he dished some today. He said he was """"itching for a fight on a whole range of issues."" But when talking about Democrats, he has the intensity associated with family arguments. He was as heated as he gets in public (still not warm enough for your hot chocolate, but above his baseline, which is the serving temperature for white wine). He warned liberals of being ""sanctimonious"" and engaging in a no-win political fight simply to stir up their bodily humors. He compared it to the last dead-end fight liberals wanted to wage--over the public option during the debate over health care reform, in which they were willing to give up the chance to extend insurance to millions for a narrow ideological crusade. If complete victories are ""the standard by which we are measuring success or core principles,"" he said, ""then, let's face it, we will never get anything done. People will have the satisfaction of having a purist position and no victories for the American people."" It is not often the case that you can persuade people to change their opinion by hinting that they're not very bright. (The beatings will stop once morale improves!) Democrats on the other side of the issue are fighting with their own moral passion. Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana challenged the plan's ""moral corruptness"" as she headed in to a meeting with Vice President Joe Biden, who was visiting the Hill to persuade Democrats. ""It's what I'm calling the Obama-McConnell plan."" Landrieu said. ""We're going to borrow $46 billion from the poor, from the middle class, from businesses of all sizes basically to give a tax cut to families in America today, that despite the recession, are making over a million dollars."" Let's pause to measure the distance: Two years ago Barack Obama was the Democratic Party's great hope. Now he is being accused of undermining one of the party's core moral principles. As a political matter, the president is continuing to plant his flag in the middle --not just in this fight, but for his entire presidency. Responding to the last question of the session, the president gave the most detailed articulation to date of his governing philosophy. He made the case for the sort of compromise, diversity, and working for imperfect progress that has been the hallmark of the American experience. ""This country was founded on compromise. I couldn't go through the front door at this country's founding. And, you know, if we were really thinking about ideal positions, we wouldn't have a union."" (Read the entire answer in this sidebar.) Obama is a pragmatist, just as he and his aides claimed when he came into office. This is why the charge that Obama is a socialist was always so silly. What causes him genuine irritation? Not the thwarting of his secret utopian dreams, but the inability to get a bipartisan compromise. To see how a true socialist might respond in this situation, look no further than Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont, who has vowed to block the deal. The president was trying so hard to explain himself to his friends, he stretched his analogies to the breaking point. Returning to the hostage analogy he used to describe Republicans in his last news conference before the midterm election, he said, ""I think it's tempting not to negotiate with hostage-takers, unless the hostage gets harmed. Then people will question the wisdom of that strategy. In this case, the hostage was the American people, and I was not willing to see them get harmed."" Later he said the American people needed to get ""in a safe place, so that we can then get the economy in a stable place. And then we're going to have a broad-based discussion across the country about our priorities."" For a moment there, he almost seemed ready to wrap the American people in emergency blankets and give them orange juice. Before he can do that, though, he's got to deal with the rumble in his own squad car. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter."

29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/12/middle_man.html	"President Obama could have worn a cape. Speaking to reporters about a deal to extend the Bush tax cuts and unemployment insurance, he offered a dire narrative of what might have been. Ideologues in both parties were locked in a dangerous game with no concern for the welfare of the American people. ""Without a willingness to give on both sides, there's no reason to believe that this stalemate won't continue into next year,"" he said. A stalemate would mean a tax increase for everyone, and tax cuts for the hardest-hit would expire, along with unemployment benefits. In the nick of time a hero arrived to save the parties from themselves. Who was that quick-thinking citizen? Why, it was Man of Reason!  ""I know there's some people in my own party and in the other party who would rather prolong this battle, even if we can't reach a compromise. But I'm not willing to let working families across this country become collateral damage for political warfare here in Washington."" Obama ran in 2008 as a man who would bring both parties together. Monday night he presented himself as a pragmatic leader who had done just that. The difference was that two years ago it sounded like a process where everyone locked arms. This time it was more of a headlock, and any collateral damage is likely to be among the president's own liberal base. Obama presented himself as a warrior for agreement. He was also a lecturer. ""The American people didn't send us here to wage symbolic battles or win symbolic victories,"" he said. ""I want everybody to remember over the course of the coming days, both Democrats and Republicans, that these are not abstract fights for families that are impacted. ... We cannot play politics at a time when the American people are looking for us to solve problems."" The White House holiday party for its liberal friends might be awkward (or empty). Liberals were already upset  with the president when it looked like he was going to cave on his previous opposition to extending tax cuts. They are not likely to enjoy this lecture about the need for putting the middle class ahead of playing politics. On the substance, there are parts of the $900 billion deal that liberals should find attractive: a reduction in the payroll tax, extension of unemployment benefits for 13 months, and extension of the Earned Income Tax Credit. These programs will pump hundreds of billions of stimulus into the economy over the next two years, which many liberals want. A senior White House aide promised it would create ""a very significant positive impact on job growth and unemployment."" Another administration official pointed out that these achievements were greater than any of their allies had expected would come out of the deal: ""After we all realized some compromise was going to happen, the agreement we got is actually damn good."" The lesson from the president is one White House aides have been making one way or another since last month's election: The world is different. The things we want will come with a price determined by the GOP. The questions for liberals are a) whether they buy that formulation and b) whether they think the president overpaid. Not only did Republicans win on extension of tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans; they also won a new lower rate of 35 percent for the estate tax and a higher exemption of $5 million for it. Democrats in the House and Senate made it clear Monday night that they had not yet signed on to the president's deal. The president said the tax cuts for the wealthy would not last beyond the two-year extension, because after the coming deficit debate, Americans would see how the country just can't afford them. He said he would ""engage in a conversation"" about the choices to help them get to this position. But he's been engaged in that conversation about these tax cuts for months. Americans already agreed with him. Only 26 percent favor the GOP view in a recent CBS poll. It was the need to get a deal when faced with an immovable opposition (including some in his own party) that caused Obama to give in on his tax cut position. That kind of dynamic isn't going to change in the next year, when the GOP will have more control. Washington has been flooded with deficit reduction plans of late. They have different ideological shapes, but most require everyone to sacrifice something they want. That wasn't how this deal came together. Both sides agreed to give each other largely what they wanted. It is financed entirely by adding to the national debt. (Whee!) As the president spoke, he sounded like he did when announcing his Afghanistan policy: We have to escalate this war in order to end it. The majority of economists seem to agree that this kind of stimulus is necessary now before we buckle in for that grueling conversation about austerity. This may be the last agree-and-spend deal of its kind. Maybe the next grand bargains will be measured in terms of dollars saved. Of course, that will depend on political courage, which will in turn depend on what voters think. Right now the American families President Obama talked about are grateful, but they might also learn a lesson that will make things harder for him: Even in the Age of Austerity, there's always room for pie.Like Slate on  Facebook.
