But President Obama conducted his negotiations in the ornate East Room of the White House, using his eighth news conference as his forum. He pleaded with Republicans to free tax cut legislation, to drop their blockade of a bill that would help small businesses, and to release his nominees from confirmation limbo. He tried to save America's tradition of religious tolerance from the zealots and political hacks that have seized it. Most of all, the president engaged in his ongoing mission to rescue his administration and party from the looming election disaster that hangs over them like the mammoth chandelier beneath which he spoke. It was Obama's longest news conference, and he started by talking about the economy. The most definitive thing he could say was that he had named Austan Goolsbee, a former Slate contributor, to be the chairman of his Council of Economic Advisers. Unlike his economic agenda, this is a decision that doesn't require congressional approval (though the delayed announcement mirrored a critique of his latest round of economic medicine--obvious moves that seemed to take longer to announce than required). In his opening statement, the president reminded the country of the difficult economic situation he inherited. His focus wasn't just on how bad things were, but on the party that caused those things. He singled out Republican ""policies of the previous decade had left our economy weaker and our middle class struggling. ... There were policies that cut taxes, especially for millionaires and billionaires, and cut regulations for corporations and for special interests, and left everyone else pretty much fending for themselves."" The president's main message is that those kinds of policies will come back if Republicans gain control of one or both houses of Congress. The key policy fight illustrating this idea, says Obama, is the debate over extending the Bush tax cuts, which are set to expire at the end of this year. Obama wants Republicans to extend the tax breaks only for those making less than $250,000. ""What I've got,"" he said, ""is the Republicans holding middle-class tax relief hostage because they're insisting we've got to give tax relief to millionaires and billionaires."" This isn't quite right. Sens, Ben Nelson of Nebraska, Kent Conrad of North Dakota, and Evan Bayh of Indiana--Democrats all--have said the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy should also be extended. Various House Democrats hold the same position. In the main, however, Democrats are anxious to get into a fight with Republicans over cutting taxes for the well-off because there's no good news to talk about. As the president said, ""The hole the recession left was huge, and progress has been painfully slow."" The best thing the president could say was, ""We're not there yet."" Realistic. Sober. Adult. Hardly rousing. Republicans don't mind being seen as hostage takers--or perhaps they'd rephrase their role as brakemen. In their view, the country wants a governor on Obama and the Democrats. There seemed to be some support for this in a recent Wall Street Journal poll. Sixty-two percent of those who participated said they favored ""different political parties controlling the Congress and the presidency to prevent either one from going too far."" Polls show voters don't particularly like Republicans, but they don't have to if all they want is for them to slow down the Democrats. House Minority Leader John Boehner issued a press release responding to the president's remarks about an hour before they were over, which gives you some indication of the state of political dialogue these days. (When rebuttals are issued to statements or news events that are just starting, or haven't started at all, we are getting dangerously close to making those statements or events entirely unnecessary. In a tight economy, this might save money.) The president talked the most about the economy but was most impassioned about the dual Islamic controversies of the moment. When he talked about the pastor who has been threatening to burn the Quran tomorrow, Terry Jones (who he referred to as ""the individual down in Florida""), Obama was as ardent as he gets. ""This is a way of endangering our troops, our sons and daughters, fathers and mothers, husbands and wives, who are sacrificing for us to keep us safe. And you don't play games with that."" Slate V: Obama addresses Quran controversy Twice Obama was asked about the mosque in downtown New York City. ""This country stands for the proposition that all men and women are created equal, that they have certain inalienable rights,"" he said. ""And what it means is that if you could build a church on a site, you could build a synagogue on a site, if you could build a Hindu temple on a site, then you should be able to build a mosque on the site."" On the eve of the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, he praised his predecessor for promoting tolerance. ""One of the things that I most admired about President Bush was, after 9/11, him being crystal clear about the fact that we were not at war with Islam."" In his first defense of religious tolerance he referred to his Christian faith (for any who might still be confused) and warned, ""We have to make sure that we don't start turning on each other."" In the second he talked about Muslims in America. ""I've got Muslims who are fighting in Afghanistan in the uniform of the United States armed services. They're out there putting their lives on the line for us, and we've got to make sure that we are crystal clear, for our sakes and their sakes--they are Americans, and we honor their service. And part of honoring their service is making sure that they understand that we don't differentiate between them and us. It's just us."" This was the president's first news conference since May, and there probably won't be another until after the election. Between now and then, he promised, he would push the economic message about returning to Republican policies. Whether he can do anything to change his party's fate when the country's economic mood is so dark is a mystery. In the end, the president, who is sometimes called the most powerful person in the world, may be the hostage. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter."

1	1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/09/quranamok.html	"So let me get this straight: A Florida minister who has fewer than 50 followers, doesn't answer to any Christian organization, and doesn't even know the other pastors in his town set off panic and violence around the world by holding hostage a few copies of the Quran. He withstood pleas from the National Association of Evangelicals, the World Evangelical Alliance, the U.S. secretary of state, and the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Then, in negotiations with an imam from Orlando, he agreed to surrender his hostages in exchange for what he thought was a deal to relocate a Manhattan mosque from its planned site near Ground Zero. But the imam in Manhattan said he had made no such deal and hadn't even talked to the imam from Orlando. So now the minister says he was double-crossed and might burn his hostages after all. Someday, perhaps after a few more Qurans, American flags, effigies, cars, and embassies have been torched, all of this will be sorted out. But for now, let's be clear about one thing this crazy episode has proved: Nobody in it controls anybody else. That's more than a punch line. It's a refudiation of the mentality that led us into this mess. Remember how the frenzy over the Manhattan community center started? Conspiracy theorists concocted a global Muslim plot to erect a ""victory mosque"" at Ground Zero. The Weekly Standard spun a diabolical web linking the imam behind the project to Hamas, the Gaza flotilla, Pakistani jihadists, and ""the Iranian clerical dictatorship."" Newt Gingrich depicted the project as part of an insidious scheme to bring the United States under the control of Islamic law. The minister in Florida, Terry Jones, seized on the controversy to peddle his theory that ""Islam is of the devil."" But which Islam? Jones never bothered to read the book he was preparing to burn, which is why he never understood that Islam, like Christianity, is a religion of multiple interpretations, encompassing believers who often disagree with one another. You might recall, for instance, the Iran-Iraq War. So it must have come as quite a shock to Jones when the Manhattan imam disagreed with the Orlando imam about relocating the Ground Zero mosque (which wasn't a mosque and wasn't at Ground Zero--but let's not get bogged down in details) and said they had never even talked about it. Aren't all these imams connected on Glenn Beck's chalkboard? Don't they confer all the time? Apparently not. Meanwhile, the Gingriches and Joneses of the Muslim world have cooked up their own theories. They think the Quran-burning stunt is an American plot and that President Obama is behind it. In the past 48 hours, they've marched against the United States, incinerated American flags, and threatened jihad. Thousands of Afghans gathered in their capital and five provinces. Some chanted ""Death to the Christians."" Others threw rocks at a NATO base. One man was killed. A British Islamist is urging Muslims everywhere to burn the stars and stripes. Sorry, but the world doesn't work this way anymore. Christians don't control Christians, Americans don't control Americans, Afghans don't control Afghans, and Muslims don't control Muslims. The curse of our age isn't a global empire of infidels or Islamists. It's the collapse of empires and the rise of rogues. In this world, an imam in Manhattan who preaches reconciliation isn't your enemy. He's your friend. The chaos of the last 24 hours--in fact, of the last two weeks--has trashed all the conspiracy theories. The Manhattan imam, Feisal Abdul Rauf, went on CNN and condemned Hamas terrorism. Jones went on MSNBC and said he wouldn't cancel his Quran-burning party even if his political hero, George W. Bush, asked him to. Sarah Palin denounced Jones' plan. Gingrich scrapped a promised video address to a 9/11 rally against the Manhattan community center. Jones dropped out of sight and didn't even return calls from fellow Islam-basher Rev. Franklin Graham. Then Jones cut a deal with an agent of the religion of the devil, only to discover that the agents of the devil didn't speak for one another. I've been to churches like Jones' before. They may subscribe nominally to a denomination, but they're fiercely independent. The minister runs the church and interprets the Bible in his own peculiar manner, all the while insisting that he's just reading it the way God wrote it. How hard is it to grasp that mosques and imams vary in pretty much the same way? Some preach hate. Some preach love. Some preach bogus literalism. Some think the Manhattan community center should be moved. The bargain Jones thought he had struck--canceling the Quran burning in exchange for moving the community center--has been brewing as a moral-equivalence fantasy all week. Sarah Palin suggested it yesterday: ""People have a constitutional right to burn a Koran if they want to, but doing so is insensitive and an unnecessary provocation--much like building a mosque at Ground Zero."" This morning, Gingrich chimed in, telling ABC's Good Morning America that ""it's wrong to burn the Quran, and it's wrong to build the mosque at Ground Zero, and both should be stopped."" This is a silly and insulting proposition. If I offered to cancel my Torah burning in exchange for you relocating your synagogue, you'd recognize my offer right away as extortion. Slate V: Obama addresses Quran controversy in his press conference Palin, Gingrich, and their chorus of right-wing commentators have had four months to explain, without resort to group blame or religious discrimination, why no Muslim house of worship should be built near Ground Zero. They have yet to answer the question. That's why they keep talking about ""sensitivity"" and ""provocation""--words that cloak the intellectual crudity behind the sentiment. Eventually, it will dawn on them that the Muslims who want to swim, eat, and worship at a community center in Lower Manhattan really are different from the Muslims who flew planes into the World Trade Center. And maybe they'll figure out that the imam in Manhattan disagrees not just with the imam in Orlando, but with imams in Gaza and Pakistan, too. The manifest chaos of Christianity is an easy starting point for this kind of reflection. Jones is a fool and a hater, but he's his own man. So is Fred Phelps. His Westboro Baptist Church, headquartered at godhatesfags.com, is now pledging to pick up where Jones left off, burning not just the Quran but the American flag [PDF] on 9/11. There will always be some angry crackpot ready to defile your flag, burn your scripture, or hijack your airliner. These crackpots don't speak for your religion or mine. They speak for themselves. Yesterday in Iowa, Gingrich said the Quran-burning episode just shows that the United States ""has some people who are outrageous, as every country does, and they don't represent the country.""

2	2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/09/going_negative.html	"Each week until the election, I'm posting some of the questions I'm trying to answer based on news of the week or something that's come up in my reporting. In the following weeks, I'll try to answer some of these questions. Feel free to weigh in with answers--or with more political questions--at slatepolitics@gmail.com or in the comments section below. Here are this week's questions: Will Obama's plans die with a whimper? This week, President Obama announced two new economic measures: a $50 billion infrastructure investment project and a $200 billion set of tax incentives to spur research and investment. Neither will pass Congress before the election. Republicans are in no mood to deal and appear to benefit from blocking Obama. So the question is not whether these pieces of legislation will die, but whether they will die without a fight--or even the fake fight with Republicans that might allow some Democrats to at least draw distinctions with the other party that match up with voters' underlying values. There are a lot of obstacles to bringing Obama's measures to the floor. The first is lack of enthusiasm from his own party. His proposals were met with near silence. The loudest voices have been in opposition or at least skeptical. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, for example, facing a tough campaign, said he did not support the infrastructure spending and would only support it if it was paid for with existing stimulus funds. In the House, a few Democrats have spoken out against the measure. Even if Obama could somehow find the Republican vote in the Senate to block a filibuster in support of these measures, there just isn't time. The Senate returns for only three weeks before everyone leaves again to campaign. That's barely enough time to welcome the distinguished gentlemen back from vacation. Plus, the agenda is already full. There needs to be a vote on a continuing budget resolution, small-business legislation, and a debate over extending the Bush tax cuts. That's where the big fights are likely to occur, as Democrats try to paint Republicans as favoring the wealthy over the middle class. How ugly will this campaign get? This week the president told ABC's George Stephanopoulos that if the election is a referendum on the economy, Democrats are in trouble. To avoid doom, they've been trying for months to frame the election as a ""choice"" between two candidates. (By definition, of course, all elections present voters with just such a ""choice."" But the administration wants people to think more about the Republican than about their upset with the Obama administration.) One way to do that is to increase the negative attacks on the specific GOP opponent. ""If a candidate has a positive ad up right now, they probably won't in a few weeks,"" says a senior administration official. So far the deluge has not happened. Democrats are running attack ads against congressional candidates in Wisconsin and Michigan. In Ohio, the Democratic Senate candidate Lee Fisher is tying his opponent Rob Portman to George Bush. But lots of ads are still focusing on introducing the Democratic candidates to voters, like the one from Mary Jo Kilroy, a first-term House member from Ohio. She ""voted against the bank bailout,"" she boasts, creating some distance from the highly unpopular program. But sometimes a positive is a negative. As Factcheck.org pointed out, Kilroy and four other Democrats who claim to have voted against the bank plan weren't in Congress at the time. Who's the new Mark Critz? After Democrat Mark Critz won the special election in Pennsylvania's 12th district earlier this year, it became a tale that administration and party officials told to one another to ward off the bad spirits. See, a Democrat could win in a toss-up district--even in this terrible year! It was offered to other candidates as a possible route away from a rout in 2012. It was never a clean story, though, because Critz won by distancing himself from the president and Washington Democrats. Now Democrats will have to find a new Mark Critz, because the original's strategy is probably not something they want to emulate. Critz was among the first Democrats to oppose Obama's new infrastructure program. ""$50 billion of additional government spending will do little to create permanent jobs and will only add to our massive deficit,"" Critz said. ""That's why I strongly oppose the president's misguided plan."" So now Pennsylvania's 12th district isn't such a good story for Democrats--if for no other reason than you can't say the key to keeping Democratic losses down is bashing a White House economic gambit designed to keep Democratic losses down. As my colleague David Weigel reports, Alan Grayson may be holding his own in a tough district. Perhaps he is the new candidate Democrats can point to. Is there only one?

So starting today, we're going to offer a new end-of-the-week feature. Each week, I'll post some of the questions I'm trying to answer based on news of the week or something that's come up in my reporting. In the following weeks, I'll try to answer some of these questions. Feel free to weigh in with answers--or with more political questions--at slatepolitics@gmail.com or in the comments section below. Here are this week's questions: What does Obama unleashed sound like? President Obama has been slowly turning up his political rhetoric for months. He's made broad attacks on Republicans and taken specific shots at people like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. He hasn't turned the dial up to 11 though--yet. Before his vacation, he warned Republicans he's going to start. ""They've forgotten I know how to politick pretty good,"" he said before leaving for vacation. He's likely to start Monday in Milwaukee, Wisc., at a Labor Day rally. What will the new pitch sound like? Will Obama and his aides fully let go of worries about damaging his post-partisan brand? More important, will the president be effective at rallying Democrats to the polls with more partisan rhetoric? Obama clearly enjoys giving a political speech, but his circumstances have changed since he last gave so many good ones. During the 2008 campaign, he was derided as all pretty words and no substance. Now he faces the opposite problem: He's pushed and passed a heap of big, fibrous legislation but gets criticism (sometimes from himself) for not being very good at communicating. Enthusiasm vs. ground game. Tea Party activists have given Republicans a huge boost of energy. Polls regularly show an enthusiasm advantage for the GOP. But can the GOP harness that energy and get people to the polls? Democratic officials have been saying for months that it cannot, and this was why the Tea Party was mostly hype. (Unfortunately for their argument, they offered Joe Miller's campaign in Alaska as proof--and look what happened there.)  A new Gallup finding suggests the enthusiasm may be linked to turnout. Republicans are following the campaign more closely, which Gallup says is a key indicator of likelihood a person will vote. The advantage for Democrats is that they have the better organization. Organizing for America, the Obama campaign operation, has been up and running for more than three years. Some of the volunteers have been knocking on the same doors since Obama was just a freshman senator from Illinois running for president. Personal connections are also key to voter turnout, and these volunteers have made multiple trips to the same houses. If the key for Democrats this cycle is turning out the people who voted for Obama in 2008, these volunteers may be in the best position to make the argument to those voters that despite widespread frustration, Obama and the Democratic Party still deserve their support. Is control of the Senate really in play? For the last several months, political prognosticators and political scientists have inched up their predictions for a Republican takeover of the House. To make Rep. John Boehner speaker, they need to win a net of 39 seats, which everyone acknowledges is a real possibility (notwithstanding the fact that some Democratic officials are not allowed to admit this). But a Senate takeover has always been considered a stretch. Republicans would need to win a net of 10 seats. That would require Republicans winning not just in tossup states like Colorado and Florida, but also seats in California, Washington, and Wisconsin.  Now things have changed a little. Two influential prognosticators are more open to the possibility of a Senate takeover--or, at least, moving away from the idea that it is an impossibility. Larry Sabato, the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, predicts the GOP will win eight or nine seats. ""If the Republican wave on November 2 is as large as some polls are suggesting it may be, then the surprise of election night could be a full GOP takeover,"" he wrote. Charlie Cook increased his Senate prediction to a seven- to nine-seat pickup for the Republicans, arguing that ""a plausible case can now be made that ... 10 seats are within their reach.""

6	6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/09/creep_the_faith.html	"Two months ago, Rick Lazio, the leading Republican candidate for governor of New York, challenged his Democratic opponent, Andrew Cuomo, to investigate a proposed Islamic community center two blocks from Ground Zero. When Cuomo replied that the issue was religious freedom, Lazio insisted that his concerns were strictly about who would fund the project and what its imam had said about 9/11. ""It's outrageous, honestly, that Andrew Cuomo is raising [the] issue of religion here,"" Lazio told a TV interviewer. ""This is about security."" Last week, Lazio began running a new ad. It concluded with these words: ""Call Andrew Cuomo and tell him a Ground Zero mosque is wrong."" A Ground Zero mosque. Not a mosque funded by radicals. Not a mosque run by somebody who said something controversial about 9/11. Not a mosque that recruits jihadists. A mosque--any mosque--near Ground Zero is wrong. This is the latest frontier in the expanding campaign against the mosque. The initial allegations about money and extremism have receded to the background. In their place, candidates around the country are drawing a bright, categorical line against an Islamic house of worship  near Ground Zero. It is a line based entirely on religion. ""Ground Zero is the wrong place for a mosque,"" says Rick Scott, the Republican nominee for governor of Florida, in a TV ad. ""The 9/11 site is hallowed ground, and it is too painful and divisive to build a mosque there,"" says Roy Barnes, the Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia. ""It is insensitive and disrespectful to locate a mosque/Islamic center at a site that was damaged on 9/11,"" says Rep. John Shimkus, Republican of Illinois. * ""The construction of a mosque near Ground Zero should not, and must not happen,"" says Steve Chabot, the former Republican congressman running for his old seat in Ohio. ""Building a mosque near Ground Zero is insensitive, an affront to the victims of 9/11, and it lacks respect for the general public's feelings,"" says Richard Hanna, a Republican candidate for Congress in upstate New York. Tim Walberg, a Michigan Republican running for Congress, says President Obama ""is wrong to offend the memories of the September 11th fallen by voicing support for building an Islamic mosque on Ground Zero."" The GOP's U.S. Senate candidates are nearly unanimous. Carly Fiorina of California, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Mark Kirk of Illinois, Linda McMahon of Connecticut, and Len Britton of Vermont all emphasize the mosque's location as their concern. ""It is divisive and disrespectful to build a mosque next to the site where 3,000 innocent people were murdered at the hands of Islamic extremism,"" says Marco Rubio, the party's nominee in Florida. ""It is disrespectful to the families who have lost loved ones on 9/11 to build a mosque on that sacred ground,"" says Rob Portman, the nominee in Ohio. ""It is provocative in the extreme to build a mosque in the shadow of ground zero,"" says the campaign of Pat Toomey, the nominee in Pennsylvania. ""It is insensitive and inappropriate to build a mosque near the ground zero site,"" says Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia. ""I do not support the building of a mosque at Ground Zero,"" says Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina. Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana says ""the prospect of a mosque right near this site of reverence and respect for lost loved ones from the attack shows a serious lack of sensitivity. In fact, the majority of the country is strongly opposed to building a mosque at the site of the most tragic terrorist attack on America."" Vitter is right about the polls. In the latest survey, released Tuesday by Quinnipiac University, a majority of New York State voters, 53 percent to 39 percent, agrees that ""because of the sensitivities of 9/11 relatives, Muslims should not be allowed to build the mosque near Ground Zero."" Yes, you read that correctly: A mosque should not be allowed. So when Republicans go around saying that ""the general public's feelings"" and ""the majority of the country"" should govern the mosque dispute, they're talking about a majority that's willing to mess not just with the mosque, but with the Constitution. And they're flirting with something much more dangerous. In New York, a man was indicted Monday for allegedly slashing a taxi driver on Aug. 25 after finding out the driver was a Muslim. In Tennessee, FBI agents are investigating a suspicious fire, apparently set Friday night, that damaged construction equipment at the planned site of a local Islamic center. In Seattle, a man was arrested last week for allegedly punching a convenience store clerk in the head and telling him, ""You're not even American, you're al-Qaida."" And last week, a brick was thrown at the window of an Islamic center in California. Outside the building, somebody posted a warning: ""No Temple for the god of terrorism at Ground Zero."" Ground Zero was just the beginning. The case against a mosque there has shifted from extremism to Islam. Now Republicans say their no-mosque rule extends only to Ground Zero, or three blocks from Ground Zero, or whatever exclusion zone the majority feels is appropriate. But the fire of enmity has already spread from terrorism to religion. I don't think New York can contain it. Like  Slate on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter.

7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/08/the_fearless_rino_killers.html	"The life of an Establishment Republican used to be simple. If you dodged scandal and could produce polls showing you could get re-elected, the party back in Washington would go to bat for you. You'd win. Your biggest threat came from a group called the Club for Growth, a well-funded political machine that bundles money and bombs the airwaves on behalf of candidates who challenge wrong-voting ""Republicans in Name Only""--RINOs. Stay out of the Club for Growth's way, and you're safe. This is not how it worked in Alaska. Shortly after Alaska attorney Joe Miller launched his primary bid against Sen. Lisa Murkowski, he met with the Club for Growth to make his case for an endorsement. He didn't get it. ""We loved him,"" says club spokesman Mike Connolly, ""and we saw a path to victory for him, but we didn't think it was terribly possible."" Miller got down to campaigning, raised money elsewhere, won other endorsements. Polls showed him closing the gap, but not enough for the club to change its mind. Then something surprising happened: On Election Day, Miller edged Murkowski by more than 1,600 votes. The Club for Growth responded by doing something it had declined to do months earlier: On Friday, three days after the election, it endorsed Miller. Did the mighty club, the terror of Lincoln Chafee and Arlen Specter, err by failing to jump in sooner? Not really. The rules for punishing wayward Republicans haven't changed. But there are more and more people eager to participate in the punishment, and they learn from every coup. Neither party appreciates how much animus exists between Republicans and their party, and how easy it can be to mobilize them against incumbents. The Republican rank and file figured this out in the 2009 special election for New York's 23rd District. Most of the media covered it as a black eye for the GOP, delivered by the Tea Party. After conservatives like Sarah Palin and Dick Armey endorsed the Conservative Party's candidate over the GOP's well-liked, moderate candidate, the moderate dropped out, and Democrats won the historically Republican seat just in time to get an extra vote for health care reform. At the time, RedState Editor Erick Erickson wrote a much-derided analysis, calling the race a ""win"" and arguing that ""the GOP now must recognize it will either lose without conservatives or will win with conservatives."" Nine months later, Republican insurgents have this stuff down to a science. Stage 1: Shameless self-promotion. It really isn't hard to convince Tea Party activists and conservative bloggers that your candidate is the real deal and his opponent is an establishment hack. You just need to be subtle about it and make it sound like you're part of a groundswell. And you need to know which activists and bloggers have credibility. On June 16, Joe Miller proved he understood that by calling Erickson. Voila! Miller soon won an endorsement, in which Erickson told readers that Murkowski was ""one of Mitch McConnell's loyal lieutenants who he keeps in place to shut down people like Jim DeMint and the fiscal conservatives in the Senate."" Sarah Palin, who endorsed Miller in June, name-checked him on Facebook. The Tea Party Express, which got onboard at the same time, churned out e-mails about Miller, announced its ad buys, and peddled news of this to influential blogs. Ace of Spades, a conservative blogger who's built a following by being funny and training his guns on establishment Republicans, informed readers that he was getting sick of the Tea Party Express's hard sell but that he supported Miller. ""I didn't push Miller the first day they asked because of that annoyance,"" he wrote. ""But the second time, I realized what I was doing: I was taking out my resentment at the you-do-this-for-free conservative organizations against a very good candidate I would otherwise support, just because I was annoyed that it had been decided I was Mr. Cheap Date."" In other words, the hard sell worked. Stage 2: From campaign to crusade. Outside the conservative media, Miller's campaign was either ignored or treated as a sideshow to the great saga of Sarah Palin's ""mama grizzly"" endorsements. Inside the conservative media, Miller was only the latest in a string of Republicans treated as heroes. Some of them, like Wisconsin congressional candidate Sean Duffy, scared the Democrats they were running against into retirement. Some, like Senate candidate Chuck DeVore in California, handily lost their primaries. All of the candidates who caught fire with the base checked off the right boxes--anti-""Obamacare,"" anti-stimulus, and so on--but more important, they all offered the chance to hassle the ""establishment."" The more that Senate candidates irritated the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the better. The more that the mainstream media worried about this candidate making politics more partisan and driving David Gergen to tears, the better. Leave it to the party's leadership to worry about appealing  to the middle. The base wants 2010 to be a base election, a referendum on Democratic failure. If a Republican campaign can win over the influential activists, it can get all the support it needs without the ""mainstream media"" paying any attention at all. A post about the candidate at HotAir.com or Jim Geraghty's Campaign Spot is enough proof that the candidate has a chance. This is how the Tea Party movement grew--national groups doing promotion, local blogs and tweets confirming what was happening on the ground, and conservative media verifying the story in a manner that convinced skeptics the movement was real. Stage 3: Driving in the coffin nails. As insurgent campaigns go, Joe Miller's was relatively slow to catch fire. According to Blogpulse, which tracks mentions of names online, there were 43 posts that mentioned Miller last Monday, 63 on Tuesday, and 372 on Wednesday, when it looked like Miller had pulled the upset. But it was after the election that the base's frenzy really mattered. Miller became a cause, not just a candidate, and conservative blogs went into overdrive to attack any hint of a pushback from the establishment--in this case, from the NRSC. By the time the Club for Growth endorsed Miller, conservatives like Erickson had been on the attack for 72 hours. How much did the base's energy, and the blogs' furor, change what was already a gloomy picture for Murkowski? It's not clear, but according to sources, the NRSC's lawyer for Murkowski left the state Saturday. And it fired up conservatives to e-mail the Libertarian Party of Alaska and weaken the already-faltering interest in the party handing its nomination to the senator. ""We were getting nudged from all sides,"" says party Chairman Scott Kohlhaas. ""It's amazing, because we had barely even considered the idea of nominating her. It was like Seinfeld, a show about nothing."" When the Tea Party and the GOP split in New York's 23rd District, liberals hoped it was the start of a trend--that the new GOP base, powered by blogs, would actually split the movement. In fact, it did the opposite and perfected the old Club for Growth strategy. The smart strategists are turning their Republican candidates into Spartacuses and Davids. The smart partisans like Erickson are creating a feedback loop and getting the base revved up about those candidates. And the conservative base works out its issues by working even harder for the GOP. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/08/on_the_mall_with_brother_glenn.html	"On Friday night, FreedomWorks was capitalizing on Glenn Beck's ""Restoring Honor"" rally on Saturday with a rally of its own. Activists crowded inside the fittingly named Daughters of the American Revolution Constitution Hall, where Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., ripped the roof off the place with a speech that started with district-by-district politics and built to a call-and-response: ""Are you in? I'm in! Be in!"" Mike Lee, a Republican lawyer who is all but certain to be the next senator from Utah, told the crowd about his favorite constitutional power (letters of marque and reprisal) and described the Constitution as a sort of Tony Robbins manual: a ""recipe for economic prosperity,"" a way to make ""amazing things"" happen. As the politicians talked, volunteers walked up and down the aisles handing out signs for the candidates--""champions of freedom""--endorsed by FreedomWorks PAC. Then the emcee interrupted the proceedings. ""I think you know our next guest,"" he said, and the rest of his introduction was drowned out by applause for Glenn Beck. Beck smiled and took it in. On his way to an event at the Kennedy Center, he stopped because he wanted to take a minute to set expectations for his ""Restoring Honor"" rally today. ""It's something that, originally, a year ago, I thought was supposed to be political,"" Beck said. ""And then I kind of felt like God dropped a giant sandbag on my head."" He's serious. He wasted no words on politics. ""I think that's the hot breath of destruction breathing down our necks,"" he said Friday. ""And to fix it politically is going to take a figure that I don't see anywhere. So the idea is that the figure I see who's going to part the seas and do everything""--he points his finger at the ceiling, toward heaven--""is that one!"" Today, on the Mall, Beck makes the same argument at much, much greater length, backed up by $2 million of video/audio equipment, security, and Army-green portable toilets. He appropriates the memory of Martin Luther King Jr., just like liberals said he would, and he does it to make a political argument that doesn't sound political at all. Instead of opposing Barack Obama (he never mentions the president's name) or spelling out how to dismantle the welfare state, he informs the people who want to do this that they are merely being obedient to God and restoring the goodness that America has lost. On Friday night, there was no disagreement from the cheap seats. The crowd that flowed into Washington to watch Beck is coming on faith, in several senses of the word. People hardly knew what the agenda for today's rally was, because Beck kept that mysterious. They were ready for a religious message, because it's an overwhelmingly Christian crowd, packed with the older, white evangelicals who never warmed to Obama even in 2008, when he was popular. These are people who have never forgotten what Obama said, 29 months ago, about voters who ""cling to guns or religion."" It's just that they've learned some economics since then--or at least economics as defined by Glenn Beck. ""He teaches so much,"" said Tracy Henchman, who flew to Washington from Florida with her husband, Mark. They're eating some of the pulled pork provided by FreedomWorks to attendees of the pre-rally. ""He's the only one of these hosts who doesn't just bitch, but gives you solutions. He teaches us what will happen after bills are passed. I always knew that Congress was passing bills, but I didn't know what was in them!"" After the FreedomWorks rally on Friday, Mark and Tracy grabbed lawn chairs and headed for the reflecting pool. Beck's set was already in place a few levels down from the Lincoln Memorial. It wasn't yet clear how many people he brought to Washington as middle-aged Americans in patriotic gear hovered around the Lincoln and war memorials like moths around a gaslight. This must be one of the few places where you can still buy, with no hipster irony, buttons and T-shirts that make fun of Jane Fonda. This is where the least liberal conversations in Washington happen. ""I love Ronald Reagan,"" said Tracy. ""He was what a realAmerican president should be. They should play his speeches all the time, not Obama's speeches. At least they should play them side by side."" But a little time near the reflecting pool, around 10 p.m., provided a sense of the attitude Beck's bringing with him. It's about as angry as a  Teletubbies episode. Activists from hundreds of miles away--you can tell which state or county from their Tea Party shirts--relaxed on blankets and lawn chairs, talking about the value of the dollar or about the stupidest things their local Democratic members of Congress have said on YouTube. They are not all Beck fans. Robert White, a motivational speaker from Colorado, said he isn't ""really here to support Glenn Beck."" ""I am wracked with guilt,"" he said. ""I am responsible for this. We all are. We let this happen to our country. I'm in Denver, so I'm represented by [Democratic Rep. Diana DeGette]. The guy running against her doesn't have a prayer. But I am spending my time walking precincts, knocking on doors for him, because I need to do something. My kids need to know that I did something."" Ten hours later, the people who didn't want to sleep on the mall are making their way to the rally. They swap stories of travel hell. They buy memorabilia and grab anything that's being passed out to them, like a flyer for college ministries (""Glenn is reaching the nation. Now let's reach the campus!"") and an ad for a self-published comic called the ""Obamasutra,"" which includes ""1000 aphorisms and 180 caricatures."" They pack onto the Mall, around the World War II memorial and on a side lawn with a massive screen. They mill about, listening in to the speeches when they can but just as often reading pamphlets or Kindles or talking to people in ""Restoring Honor"" T-shirts that they've just met. They are hungry for any information they might have missed that might point them to some revelation. They've studied up on it, and Beck has done a lot of the teaching. ""If you are a student of history, you will see a lot of the same things that created chaos and crippled countries in the past,"" says Lawrence Perkins, who sells three-wheeled traveling bikes called Trikkes along with his wife, Lisa. (Former President Jimmy Carter is a customer.) ""Look at Germany after World War I, when they had such an immense debt that they printed too much money and the currency meant nothing. I'm afraid that if we keep paying for things we have no way of paying back, the currency means less and less."" This was Beck's audience. He didn't need to do any educating. The rally confirms what the crowd already knows about America: ""America is good,"" says Beck, ""not just because America is great, but because we are good! When we are good, we make America great!"" He affirms this by reminding the crowd of the portraits of Samuel Adams, George Washington, and Benjamin Franklin that ""came to him"" over the 2009 holidays, with the words faith, hope, and charity. * He bestows awards of merit in each category on a reverend, a baseball player, and a philanthropist, all of whom praise him as they accept the honor. When Sarah Palin is introduced, it's as a ""military mom"" who only makes a few obscure political references as she tells stories about brave war veterans. The Democrats who pre-butted Beck's rally by predicting an overtly political hateananny were played for suckers. They didn't pay attention to Beck's ""Founder Fridays"" episodes on Fox, his high-selling speaking tour, or his schmaltzy children's book  The Christmas Sweater. It's not his blackboard that makes him popular. It's the total package he sells: membership in a corny, righteous, Mormonism-approved-by-John Hagee cultural family. The anger is what the media focus on, he says, joking several times about what ""the press"" will do to twist his words. ""I believe God intended Barack Obama to be our president,"" says Laura Belcourt, who ""works for Sheriff Joe"" Arpaio in Phoenix's correctional system. ""I mean, this isn't about him, but he's just helping us become aware of the problem with government, overall, period. We want politicians who are going to tell us the truth and say they're not going to keep entitlements around, because we know they're just taking our money and doling it back to us and that can't last forever.""Beck's rally ends just as he said it would--without incident, political or otherwise. He's just taken the world's most derided TV audience, put them in the National Mall, and presided over the world's largest megachurch. ""Bring out the bagpipes,"" he says. Bagpipe players then walk onto his stage, and the sound of ""Amazing Grace"" fills the mall. Click here to view a  slide show of the Glenn Beck rally. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter.

9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/08/palins_magic_touch.html	"Sarah Palin has special medicine. That's about the only clear conclusion to be drawn from Tuesday's primary results. She backed five candidates in Arizona, Florida, and Alaska--and they all won. The rest of the results from the evening defied easy matching. The themes of anti-incumbency and voter anger are still out there, but the candidates who mastered those forces (or avoided them) did so in different ways. In the Republican senatorial primary in Arizona, big-spending incumbent John McCain beat back J.D. Hayworth, who tried to run as the real conservative and picked up some Tea Party support. But in the Republican senatorial primary in Alaska, big-spending incumbent Lisa Murkowski looks like she may lose to her challenger from the right, Tea Party favorite Joe Miller. In the Florida Democratic Senate primary, late-starting rich guy Jeff Greene couldn't defeat Rep. Kendrick Meek by calling him a career politician. In the Republican gubernatorial primary in the same state, however, late-starting rich guy Rick Scott was able to defeat state Attorney General Bill McCollum by painting him as a political insider. The lesson is the fundamental one in politics. Candidates and states are different. A lack of a consistent narrative is also to be expected. Still, in election years we always look for some clothesline on which to hang it all. It takes a lot of hand-waving and hokum to find one in Tuesday's results. Nevertheless, we can say this: Sarah Palin is having a good morning. Twenty of the candidates she's endorsed have won. Ten have lost. That's a pretty good record. Her biggest victory looks like it might come in the Republican Senate primary in her home state. Joe Miller wasn't well-known and spent only about $300,000 on his race against incumbent Murkowski. Analysts were predicting he'd get trounced and that Palin would be embarrassed. He is now a few thousand votes ahead, though the outcome won't be certain for about a week. Whether Miller wins or not, Palin has already won. She didn't go all out for Miller but she worked for him more than a lot of her other endorsed candidates, promoting his candidacy but also tearing down his opponent. Palin can take some credit for a portion of his good showing. There are other reasons, too. Miller had Tea Party funding and support. He also probably benefited from a ballot initiative that brought out conservative voters who wanted the state to notify the parents of young women getting abortions. Palin now has more support for a favorite story line of hers: The pundits and so-called experts said things were going to go one way but she had faith; she knew the real deal. This is part of her larger pitch: that she understands something fundamental about conservative voters. That, in turn, is what voters believe about her, which makes them think she has a special light to guide the country out of the muck. How much real power Palin has to change minds or give candidates she endorses helpful exposure is still a big question. She may just be good at picking winners. But the Palin brand now grows ever stronger because other Republicans will want to access that magic. Even if they don't believe it really exists, they have to pretend it does or risk winding up like Lisa Murkowski. If she ever decides to run for president, her opponents will have to treat her very gently. In addition to the Alaska surprise, the other big one of the night came in the Florida Republican gubernatorial primary, where it is apparently worse to be accused of being a ""career politician"" than ""felon."" Going into the election, Rick Scott and Democratic Senate challenger Jeff Greene looked like they were going to share the same story line: candidates whose personal fortunes couldn't overcome their personal problems. Scott's big problem was that his company paid the largest Medicare fraud fine in history. Two late polls showed Scott losing, but he overcame his bad rap by playing the outsider. He won a late endorsement by the Florida Tea Party and spent nearly $50 million labeling opponent Bill McCollum an insider. McCollum was indeed the establishment candidate, backed by the state party, former Gov. Jeb Bush and the Chamber of Commerce. He had this support because no one, including the National Republican Committee, thinks Scott is a very good candidate. Democrats, who face a tough environment in the country's 37 gubernatorial races, were ecstatic. They think they have a shot now in this important state. In a redistricting year, the next governor will have a say in how congressional districts are drawn--including perhaps one new congressional seat. In Arizona, meanwhile, McCain proved once again that he is a survivor. There was once a period several months ago where it looked like he might face a threat from former Rep. J.D. Hayworth. But McCain ran his campaign with the determination he used to show in the boxing ring in high school. Almost as soon as the bell went off, he rushed in and started swinging. Hayworth was a flawed candidate, and McCain used his every foible to paste him on the airwaves with negative ads. In the Colorado governor's race, Democrat John Hickenlooper is running a cute new ad about how he won't run negative ads. McCain wouldn't have won without them. Other politicians will probably take the McCain route rather than the Hickenlooper one. Finally, Ben Quayle won the Republican primary in Arizona's third congressional district. The son of the former vice president survived allegations that he'd authored racy posts about Scottsdale women on a blog and posed with two children in a campaign flier to suggest that he had children he does not actually possess. In a campaign ad, he called Barack Obama ""the worst president in history"" and promised to come to Washington and ""kick the hell out of the place."" Since his district is reliably Republican, he's likely to win in the general election, which means he should probably get himself some sturdy boots.

10	10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/08/the_inmate_vs_the_asylum.html	"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.--Rush Limbaugh is right up the road. He lives in Palm Beach and broadcasts from a studio he calls ""the Southern Command."" Today's subject, for the fourth or fifth day in a row, is why Limbaugh reacted to the president's support for a Muslim community center near the site of the 9/11 attacks by calling him ""Imam Obama."" It's hilarious, says Limbaugh: He started calling the president an imam as a ""media tweak."" And anyway, who could prove that Obama wasn't a Muslim? It was fair to ask, don't you think? Two years ago, the rumor mill churned with stories about Obama's religion and fears about how he'd treat Israel. The 22nd District of Florida, a pleasant suburban isthmus that includes the city of Boca Raton and has 75,000 to 100,000 Jewish residents, was one of the places where this was supposed to cut into Obama's margin. It didn't, and he won while Rep. Ron Klein, D-Fla., cruised to a 10-point win over Allen West, an African-American and a retired Army lieutenant colonel. In November, the two are slated for a rematch. Things are tougher for Democrats now. In a short interview just before he spoke to the Jewish Federation of Palm Beach County's Jewish Community Relations Council, Klein says that Obama's image with Jewish voters in the district had ""clearly deteriorated"" since 2008. ""It's settled in a little bit,"" says Klein. ""This [New York] mosque thing didn't help. But [Israeli Prime Minister] Netanyahu coming out and saying they had a good meeting, that helped."" Klein starts to explain himself further. ""There's definitely some--"" he starts to say. He starts a new line of argument: ""Listen, I'm making my case. When I agree with the president, I agree with him. I didn't agree with him on some of his positions on Israel. I do agree on his Iran approach."" Klein talks about his positions on the Park51 Community Center (against, though they have the right to build) and Iran (he'd support an Israeli strike on nuclear facilities) as he explains why he's going to weather the Republican backlash and defeat West. Why won't West be able to hurt him on issues like this? Well, one example: Last week, West got fed up with a tracker from the Florida Democratic Party who had been filming his speeches for juicy YouTube clips, and succeeding. West attacked the tracker for ""Gestapo-type intimidation tactics."" Trouble was, the tracker was Jewish, and his grandparents had perished in the Holocaust. And this is the kind of district where the current issue of a local newspaper, the Jewish Journal, has stories about the families of Holocaust survivors on Pages A1 and A3. Klein's campaign pounced while West's campaign spun and dug in. ""Where does he come up with this?"" asks Klein. ""My view of the way he comes across is that he wants to go to Washington to bust heads. That's not what people here want! They want something to get done."" This election is going to test that. So far, the 2010 cycle has not penalized Republican candidates for over-the-top attacks on Democrats. West clearly falls into that category. West, a client of Base Connect, a Republican firm that rakes in money for candidates with direct mail, has raised more than $4 million to Klein's $2.5 million. That's already eight times as much as West raised two years ago. He's been singled out as a ""Young Gun"" by the National Republican Congressional Committee and endorsed by Sarah Palin, in the latter case because of his military experience. Democrats respond to that with a sigh of relief. There were more established Republicans in the district who passed on the race. Had that rarest of politicians, a ""generic Republican,"" decided to run, Democrats feel like they'd be in more trouble. But they say they can portray West as too odd and too angry for the district, while Klein cuts to the right and against President Obama on the issues that West obsesses over the most, like national security and the threat of Islam. While Klein talks about terrorism in strategic terms--he'll tell the Palm Beach Jewish group exactly why he supports an Israeli strike on Iran--West talks about Islam in clinical, voice-of-doom terms.  Long before the mosque controversy, when Maj. Nidal Hasan was charged with murders at Fort Hood, West rushed out of the gate with a statement calling this a terrorist attack. *""Our soldiers are being brainwashed,"" said West. ""The horrible tragedy at Fort Hood is proof the enemy is infiltrating our military."" The polite thing to do at the time was act shocked! And horrified! At how ""crazy"" West was. But the bet West was making was that Americans--especially the ones in Boca Raton and West Palm Beach--agreed with him and lacked a leader who'd express what they were thinking. That's been a good bet this year, and West keeps making it.""You have to have individuals in Congress that have been in the Islamic world,"" he says. ""Who have read and studied the Koran and the principles thereof, so that we can have an intelligent debate about this, because this is about a totalitarian ideology with a political design."" (I spoke to West last week, over the phone. His campaign did not respond to media requests this week, which surely has nothing to do with how Democrats are trying to wrap his gaffes around his neck.)The lesson of the last few weeks is that more people nod their heads at sentiments like West's than nod their heads at the happier talk favored by Democrats. The Democratic response in Florida's 22nd District: Find another way to portray West as crazy. The guy with the video camera is only one part of a rugged operation that tracks West's every move for evidence of him talking about Democratic tyranny or flubbing his facts about taxes (he's claimed several times that Democrats want to raise the top marginal rate to 70 percent, which is around 30 points higher than they're proposing) or--this happens the most often--using cartoonishly violent language to describe what he wants to do to his political enemies, like ripping a gavel from Speaker Nancy Pelosi's hand.Even more so in some other places where Democrats are trying to save themselves by tying Republicans to political madness, the media are on their side here. A reporter for the Broward/Palm Beach New Times jokes that West's campaign speeches consist of ""noun, verb, Nazi Germany."" The Palm Beach Post endorsed West's no-chance primary opponent David Brady on the grounds that he ""hasn't urged Americans to seize bayonets and start a revolution against the new tyranny in Washington."" West responded by saying he had ""every intention of making the Palm Beach Post pay for endorsing David Brady."" What does that even mean? Democrats don't know, but they hope it scares people.The Klein campaign understands how well West plays with conservatives. It's just hoping that the place where this stuff works is FoxNewsLand or Limbaughland--someplace where West can be a star but not a congressman representing the sleepy communities Jerry Seinfeld once called ""God's waiting room."" Are they right? Stephen C. Dettor, a Republican businessman whose company builds tennis courts, says he voted for West in the primary because he ""believes in the fiscal conservative message."" But he saw Klein at a candidate forum and saw him as ""moving to the right"" to capture those angry voters who might be moving to West. And Klein says he's aware of businessmen in the district who are passing up chances to help West. His hope is that he can make people more afraid of West than they are of the things West is afraid of. One of those people--potentially at least--is Carmela Kalmanson, a retiree who expresses her fears to Klein at the meeting of Jewish leaders in West Palm Beach. ""After the Second World War we had a lot of patriotism,"" says Kalmanson. ""And then we had the McCarthy period. That's what happened after 9/11. There was unity, and now there's fear. There's so much anger, and that's a frightening place to be."" ""So your comment,"" says Klein, ""is that the inmates have taken over the asylum."" He gets a big laugh. Like Slate on  Facebook.

11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/08/the_hardest_sell.html	"NAPLES, Fla.--In some political campaigns, the acrimony is so intense, so poisonous, that neither candidate's supporters can keep a straight face when talking about their opponent. The 2010 Republican primary for governor of Florida, between multimillionaire health care executive Rick Scott and state Attorney General Bill McCollum, is one of those campaigns. ""Rick Scott?"" says Dennis Kulonda, an administrator at the Florida Institute of Technology in Orlando. He laughs out loud. It's a stage laugh, the kind you do for emphasis if you're in a Noel Coward play. ""You want to know what's wrong with Rick Scott? How about how he's probably going to wind up in jail?"" Meanwhile, at a Scott rally in a Naples sports bar, real estate agent Thomas Ravana frowns at McCollum's name, calling him a ""career politician"" who's ""never created a job in his life."" And don't get him started on McCollum's supporters. ""We're in the Costco parking lot the other day,"" says Ravana, as his partner, JoAnn DeBartolo, nods. ""I've got a Rick Scott bumper sticker on the car. And this guy comes up behind me, and just starts screaming at me: 'You're voting for a felon! You're voting for a felon!' ""(""That's false!"" interjects DeBartolo, correctly. ""He's never been convicted."") ""I'm not in the mood to start screaming at this guy,"" says Ravana. ""I just tell him, 'You're wrong,' and he tells me, 'They're both crooks, but you're voting for a felon.' "" As Ravana talks, a nearby TV plays one of McCollum's negative ads. ""You know my conservative credentials, and his scandals,"" McCollum intones. ""Weigh his personal greed against my record."" The easiest way to follow this campaign is to follow the TV ads that, in the final 72 hours before Election Day, are impossible to miss. The next easiest way to follow it is to track the constant sniping between Scott and McCollum partisans in newspapers and in blogs. What's harder to ascertain is just why Scott got into the race, and why the Republican Party, the Florida Chamber of Commerce, and just about every interest group that matters is trying to stop Scott from seizing this nomination. First, a quick backgrounder on Rick Scott. In 1987, he helped found the hospital corporation that eventually became Columbia/HCA. In 1993, he was one of many health care executives who opposed President Bill Clinton's push for health care reform. In 1997, he was one of many health care executives who saw their companies accused of Medicare fraud. (Supporters of Scott, without wanting to get too deeply into it, draw a bright red line between those last two events.) By a one-vote margin, the company agreed to oust Scott and pay $1.7 billion in settlements. It was, in a phrase made for a 30-second negative ad, the largest fraud settlement in American history. Scott bounced back with startling speed. By 2009 he had become a successful venture capitalist with big investments in, once again, the health care industry. Just weeks after the inauguration of President Obama, Scott started an organization called Conservatives for Patients' Rights and began starring in a series of TV ads in which he looked straight into the camera and warned against the dangers of socialized medicine. One year and about $15 million of his own money later, the public option was dead--and Scott does not mind taking some of the credit. ""With the Tea Party, with 9-12 and other groups, we killed the public option,"" says Scott in a short Q&A with reporters in Naples. ""We would have killed the whole thing if [Michigan Democratic Congressman] Bart Stupak's group had done what they said they were going to do and voted against the bill. It was a great experience. We really learned a lot."" That experience prepared Scott for politics. It gave him, it seemed, a chance to rebut and dismiss the old story about Columbia/HCA, as well as credibility as a conservative who worked himself ragged to stop ""Obamacare."" The key word is seemed. Since entering this race and spending close to $40 million, Scott has been brought low again--possibly low enough to lose to McCollum--by the same attacks the Democrats used against him in 2009. Except now they're coming from Republicans and Tea Party activists. The attacks started in May, as soon as it was clear that Scott could beat McCollum. The attorney general's campaign, which had been pushing the Columbia/HCA story to no avail, stepped up use of the word fraud to attack Scott. TV ads retold the tale that Democrats told to wreck Scott's credibility as a health care reform spokesman. And they damaged his credibility as a Republican candidate. ""I didn't really know who he was before he started running,"" says Anne Whitt, a community college teacher in Orlando. ""Oh, he has so many problems! He's running on his business background, you know, and using all this money on ads--well, where did he get that money?"" Scott's campaign would prefer that people ask where McCollum gets his money. The attorney general, who is mounting his fourth bid for statewide office in 10 years, has relied on a network of donors to raise a respectable war chest. But when he started falling short, he turned on the spigots. In the early summer anti-Scott ads started appearing courtesy of the Florida First Initiative, which had been set up by conservative state legislators to help elect more Republicans down the ballot. They took on a new mission: Save McCollum. The Chamber of Commerce started swinging for McCollum, as did the state GOP, as did, well, taxpayers, because McCollum accepted matching funds on the grounds that ""I've got an opponent now who's a multi-multimillionaire."" Even the Tea Party is split between the two candidates. Scott and McCollum courted the movement's busiest activists, inviting them to events and spreading the gospel of why the other guy is rotten. McCollum scored the biggest coup when Everett Wilkinson, founder of the South Florida Tea Party, showed up at a Scott rally screaming about the fraud issue. Video of Wilkinson showed up in TV ads the next day, at the same time that Scott-backing Tea Party activists were bouncing Wilkinson from their Google group for his affront. Scott may yet win today. He's gone from leading in all polls to leading in only some of them. Still, that he is in such jeopardy begs the question: Why has a man who helped kill the most expensive and popular part of the Democrats' health care plan been so vulnerable to attacks on his business record? Why would so many Republicans side with a ""career politician""--a pejorative that appears not just in Scott's anti-McCollum ads, but in basically every negative ad in every race here--over the man who killed the public option? There are two plausible reasons. The first is that ""Medicare fraud"" is a nuclear-strength political phrase and has been for decades. Republicans promise to get rid of it by making the system more efficient. Democrats promise to end it by reforming the system itself. The spine-chill that comes with that phrase has been more powerful than Scott or anyone else imagined, more powerful than the ""special interests"" phrase that was supposed to doom McCollum. The second reason is that the Republican Party remains strong and has been energized. It is no longer falling down and letting Tea Party candidates co-opt its nominations. ""It surprised me,"" Scott says glumly to reporters at his Naples rally, ""that the Republican Party has been so biased against a conservative outsider who supports the Republican Party."" The mood among his supporters is angry but not despondent. Scott can still fire them up and promise victory, and do it without mentioning his opponent by name. ""Think about what you're electing,"" says Scott, pacing around the small sports bar with a microphone. ""You're electing character."" As he talks, another McCollum ad plays on a nearby TV, and it ends with a gut punch. ""Rick Scott,"" it says. ""A failure of character."" Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

Joe Miller is widely expected to lose by a large margin to incumbent Sen. Lisa Murkowski in the Republican primary--an embarrassing defeat for the former governor, who has endorsed Miller, but also to Miller's other major backer, the Tea Party Express. Miller was a virtual unknown when he announced his Senate candidacy in April. But his big political debut came in June when both Palin and the Tea Party Express endorsed him. Miller sounds like he came out of some kind of Tea Party laboratory, with degrees from West Point and the University of Alaska, a Bronze Star from fighting in the Gulf War, and ""correct"" positions on guns, abortion, God, and big government (for, against, for, and against, respectively). Miller even has the right look: With a long, lean face, and stubble closer to 10 o'clock than 5, he could almost pass for Chuck Norris. Unfortunately for him, not even Chuck Norris in his most bad-ass role--which is, of course, Chuck Norris in real life--could rescue the Miller campaign. Always a long shot, Miller lags behind Murkowski, the heir to one of Alaska's political dynasties, by double digits. So Tuesday is likely to be a disappointment to Palin and the Tea Party Express, which has spent more than $400,000 since June on radio and television ads attacking Murkowski. Fresh off its Nevada primary victory with Sharron Angle, the Tea Party Express was looking for both an appealing challenger and a sufficiently complacent incumbent. Murkowksi fit the role in part because of her record with earmarks and her reputation for occasionally working with Democrats. ""We just felt that Joe Miller basically lines up better with Alaskan voters and the conservative kind of frontier feeling of Alaska,"" says Tea Party Express political director Bryan Shroyer. Many Alaskans don't exactly feel that way. In part because Alaska has weathered the recession better than most states and because even conservative Republicans realize the importance of federal funding in the state, ""I don't think the Tea Party movement has much currency in Alaska,"" says Ivan Moore, an independent pollster based in Anchorage. Moore's poll in July showed Miller down by 32 points, and other polls have come up with similar numbers. ""From the very beginning, he has positioned himself so far to the right of the ideological spectrum and attached himself to the Tea Party movement, which even in Alaska is perceived as being a pretty extreme right organization,"" Moore says. And Palin's endorsement hasn't helped, Moore adds. According to a Dittman Research poll conducted in April, 52 percent of Alaskans hold a negative opinion of Palin. ""When someone with those kinds of numbers endorses someone for public office, believe me, the effect is on the whole negative,"" says Moore. Despite this Tea Party skepticism in Alaska, the Miller campaign has stayed mostly with a generic Tea Party script. Miller rails against earmarks, a complaint usually made by people outside of Alaska. His hard-line immigration plan comes straight from Arizona, with no amnesty and limited birthright citizenship. His campaign has repeatedly made statements criticizing Murkowski for not doing enough to repeal health care reform, although she voted against it. He has talked about core constitutional values, but nothing particularly substantive about the state's oil, gas, and fishing industries. Says Dave Stieren, a conservative talk-radio host in Anchorage and a player in one of Miller's biggest campaign dramas: ""If I'm running Joe Miller, he's a military combat vet. He's a pro-life guy. He's a small government guy. He doesn't have a voting record or contributor record where union interests control him. This is your 98-mile-per-hour-fastball-throwing young star, and it seems that his talents and message kind of got lost."" The Miller campaign has also been plagued by setbacks and embarrassments of its own making. On Aug. 8, with the primary just more than two weeks away, then-campaign manager Paul Bauer went on Facebook and accused a University of Alaska College Republicans chapter of being Murkowski's ""uneducated puppets"" after discovering that the club had hosted a meet-and-greet for the senator. ""We don't take too kindly to that for the work we do in school and outside of school,"" says Jeremiah Campbell, a University of Alaska senior and the College Republicans' communications director. The group never officially supported Murkowski and has a policy of not endorsing candidates for the primary. The spat then became talk-radio fodder. Stieren asked aloud on his show who would be idiotic enough to lash out at young people who work for free on Republican campaigns, and Bauer called in to defend himself. The feud culminated in a barroom argument later that week, caught on videotape and (unsurprisingly) posted on YouTube, between Stieren and Bauer's wife in which she threatened to ""bury you alive."" Within 72 hours, Bauer was off Miller's campaign. Between his formulaic messaging and constant diversions, Miller hasn't been able to drum up much support. In his hometown of Fairbanks, the mayor and the newspaper have endorsed Murkowski. So have industry groups like the Alaska Forestry Association and United Fishermen of Alaska, along with most of the state legislature. Murkowski has run a low-key and well-bankrolled campaign where she's avoided engaging Miller--not mentioning his name in her reaction to the Palin endorsement, even blowing off one of their few scheduled debates and sending a staffer in her stead. As far as Miller's supporters go, the most-talked-about ones have been the guys who showed up to the 25th annual Bear Paw festival, a summer fair in greater Anchorage, with what appeared to be assault rifles. Then there are those nine people who showed up at a Tea Party Express-sponsored rally on Aug. 6 for Miller in Juneau, where they were outnumbered by reporters and operatives. And there are the die-hard Palin fans. ""There's always going to be that 20 percent lemming group that are going to throw themselves off a cliff for Sarah Palin up here,"" says Stieren. ""But you're not going to win with 20 percent."" Not surprisingly, Steve Wackowski, a campaign spokesman for Murkowski, agrees that backing from Palin and the Tea Party Express is more of a liability for Miller than anything else. ""It turns Alaskans off when outside groups from the Lower 48 like this California Tea Party Express come out and try to tell Alaskans how to vote and what they should be doing,"" says Wackowski. ""I'm from here; I grew up here. And whether it's extreme environmentalists telling us that we can't drill in ANWR or that we can't do predator control to manage our game stocks, I think that really rubs Alaskans the wrong way. On Tuesday, you're going to see evidence of that."" Despite the long odds, Miller's team is still feeling optimistic. On Friday Sarah Palin wrote yet another Facebook post extolling his commonsense conservative values, and campaign spokesman Randy DeSoto says internal polls show that the campaign is within one point of Murkowski. The race is ""pretty much neck and neck,"" he says. On Tuesday, we'll find out exactly how close those necks are.Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/08/the_folly_of_jobs_plans.html	"The typical Republican candidate of 2010 spends most of his time on one of two pursuits. The first is deriding President Obama and the Democrats for promising to rescue the economy with stimulus packages and jobs plans. The second is rolling out his stimulus and jobs plans. Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., for example, now the favorite to win Missouri's open U.S. Senate seat, has just wrapped up a ""jobs tour"" on a ""jobs bus"" with the release of a 21-page document titled ""Jobs for Missouri: Roy Blunt's Jobs Plan."" His campaign reminds reporters that the Democratic candidate, Robin Carnahan, has no jobs plan. Yet neither candidate is doing what Democrats did in order to elect Obama and sell the 2009 economic stimulus package: getting specific with numbers. Want some idea of how many jobs might be generated if you vote for Blunt or Carnahan? Tough luck. It's out of their hands. As Blunt puts it in his plan, ""Private sector job-creators are ready to invest in the kinds of job-creating activities we need to recover fully from this economic crisis and help millions of middle class families get back to work."" Trust him, then trust them. Things will work themselves out. There's nothing new about candidates offering sure-fire ""jobs plans."" By merely saying the phrase ""jobs plan,"" a candidate signals that he is serious. This year, however, voters are simultaneously more desperate and more cynical about economic policy. First, the desperation: Unemployment was at 5.6 percent when Newt Gingrich first wrapped his hand around the speaker's gavel in 1995. It was 4.6 percent when Democrats took over the House in 2007. If Republicans win in November, ""Speaker John Boehner"" might be confronting unemployment of about 10 percent when he gets the gavel in January 2011. Now, the cynicism: Democrats sold the stimulus in 2009 in part by offering predictions of how many jobs it would create. The stimulus would create (or save!) 4.1 million jobs. The unemployment rate would stay below 8 percent. What lesson did both parties learn from those sales pitches? Never try that again. Promising a lower unemployment rate, as the White House did in 2009 in selling the stimulus, ""was a dumb thing to do,"" groused Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., on Tuesday. Yet it's something that incumbents have to do with proposed legislation. They don't have to dig in and sell voters on the reliability of their predictions like Obama did. But if they introduce their plans in Congress, they have to watch as the Congressional Budget Office assesses whether their plans add up or create jobs. The economic models which Democrats used to sell their legislation, developed by the CBO and analysts like Mark Zandi of Economy.com, argued that unemployment benefits, payroll tax cuts, and expensing of investment costs would do more for the economy than other kinds of spending. A persistent recession will take its toll on predictions like these. ""Zandi's model, that simple multiplier effect, suggested that a targeted jobs credit would be effective,"" says Rea Hederman, who crunches numbers for the Heritage Foundation's Center for Data Analysis, the conservative think tank's answer to the CBO. ""It wasn't effective."" Candidates don't have to worry about any of this. Their jobs plans take the ideas that sound good--from small business owners who show up at events and from friendly think tanks--and promise to enact all of them. Will they work? If their models say they will, great. If their opponent's models say they won't--well, who trusts the models anymore? So the new jobs plans consist of ideas the parties always trot out, ideas that repeal unpopular things Obama has done, and, occasionally, numbers. In his plan, Blunt suggests that stopping cap-and-trade legislation will save ""more than 32,000 Missouri jobs."" Of course, that legislation is stalled in the Senate, so there's nothing to save that hasn't already been saved by the filibustering talents of Mitch McConnell. Blunt also joins candidates like Illinois Democrat Alexi Giannoulias in calling for extensions to the homeowner tax credit. According to the CBO, a dollar spent on this credit adds only 40 cents to the GDP. But voters still like the sound of the homeowner tax credit. Dig into candidates' jobs plans and you find ideas that have been discredited by previous experience or made to look better than serious economists think they are. Jeff Greene, a billionaire running for U.S. Senate in Florida, has one ad in which he repeats the word ""jobs"" seven times in 30 seconds. What did he plan to do to create them, other than being an ""incredibly successful businessman""? Tax credits and ""green jobs,"" the latter being the absolute least successful concept of the last two years of Democratic governance. Commercials for Ohio U.S. Senate candidate Rob Portman, a Republican, emphasize the word ""jobs"" again and again and point viewers to the ""Portman Plan to Create Ohio Jobs,"" a 12-page document downloadable from his Web site. Among the job-creation ideas: rescuing a Bush ""small business tax cut"" which affects about 2 percent of small business owners. ""My own view is that tax cuts are virtually useless under current economic conditions,"" says Bruce Bartlett, a conservative economist and Bush White House veteran. While he doesn't want the Bush tax cuts to expire in 2011, he accuses Republican candidates of engaging in ""90 percent dogma and 10 percent pandering to the Republican base."" ""The sorts of tax cuts Republicans tend to favor would not increase spending or investment, but simply reduce tax payments with the money mostly being saved, not spent,"" says Bartlett. ""In other words, they would have no more stimulative effect than the 2001 and 2008 rebates, which is to say none at all."" Republicans' argument against that is simple: Obama's spending failed to turn the economy around, so reversing his policies will reverse the economy's doldrums. It's just not clear how it all will work. In his plan, Portman proposes ""immediate action to stimulate the economy and create jobs by providing a one year suspension of the payroll tax."" CBO, Zandi, and everyone else agrees that this would be stimulative. Portman suggests paying for it with leftover stimulus money, although the expected revenue from the payroll tax in 2011 is roughly three times larger than that total. (""Return the stimulus money"" has the rhetorical effect for Republicans that ""repeal the Bush tax cuts"" used to have for Democrats, although the money on the table for Democrats is many times more than those stimulus savings.) But it's on this point that Portman offers his only hard jobs numbers: ""Research suggests that this proposal alone will create 4.8 million jobs."" According to the campaign, that number was derived from a 2008 study that no one else reads quite so optimistically. ""That's, well, that's a robust amount of job creation,"" says Hederman. ""We'll leave it at that.""Politically, it's smart for Republican candidates to avoid Obama's mistake and stay away from bold and specific predictions about how well their jobs plans will work. But if they take power, how much slack will voters give them? How many months will members of Congress be allowed to experiment before the voters become impatient and angry? That's another lesson to take from Obama: Three years into a recession, there's not much patience left.Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

14	14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/08/crazy_enough_to_win.html	"If Democrats think that the Republican Party's base is committing ritual seppuku by nominating Senate candidates like Rand Paul in Kentucky, Sharron Angle in Nevada, and Ken Buck in Colorado, they have short memories. Four years ago, the smart set was in near-universal agreement: The Democratic base was nominating candidates who couldn't win. Nowhere was this more obvious than in New Hampshire. In 2006, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee put its weight behind state legislator Jim Craig, seen as the best candidate to take on then-Rep. Jeb Bradley. Craig was challenged in the primary by Carol Shea-Porter, a liberal activist who won some glancing fame for being escorted from a George W. Bush rally wearing a T-shirt that read ""Turn Your Back On Bush."" Craig and the DCCC outspent Shea-Porter 10-1. She beat him by 20 points. The race, according to Washington strategists, was pretty much over. When a reporter from the Manchester Union Leader asked the DCCC whether it would help its new candidate, regional spokeswoman Jen Psaki responded by talking about the DCCC's candidate in New Hampshire's other House district.""I know this isn't exactly what you asked, but we see Paul Hodes emerging as one of the top pick-up opportunities in the Northeast,"" said Psaki. (She's now a deputy communications director at the White House.) As it happened, Shea-Porter won, spending less than $200,000 and beating Bradley by four percentage points. (In 2008, she beat him again.) Bradley saw the upset coming, but almost nobody else did. ""There was a perception that I was OK after she won the primary,"" said Bradley on Thursday, reached while doing work in his current job as a New Hampshire state senator. ""The final tracking poll, the night before the election, showed me up by 10 points. My core campaign stayed engaged. I never worked so hard. But the next level of volunteers, activists, donors, those types of people--they assumed I was safe."" Bradley laughed at the memory. ""I like to joke that if I had a dollar for everybody who slapped me on the back and said, 'Hey Jeb, you're all set,' I'd be retired now."" Shea-Porter was one of many Democratic candidates who weren't supposed to win their primaries in 2006. In Montana's primary for U.S. Senate, Jon Tester blew past the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's choice.  In California's 11th district and Kentucky's 3rd district, Jerry McNerney and John Yarmuth, respectively, defeated great-on-paper military veterans who'd been recruited by then-DCCC chairman Rahm Emanuel. * The National Republican Congressional Committee mocked the Democrats' bad luck. Then, McNerney and Yarmuth won. Democrats were as pessimistic about some of their races four years ago as Republicans are now. In his fine, forgotten campaign book  The Thumpin', reporter Naftali Bendavid reconstructed all of those ""losses"" and showed that the DCCC got bearish when its crop of veteran candidates ran into trouble. This week, it was not hard to find Republicans (anonymously) trashing some of the candidates that voters had handed them. Curiously, Republicans are doing the trashing without evidence that these candidates are actually going to lose. Let's take the contenders dubbed by the Huffington Post's Sam Stein as the ""tea party triumvirate."" Ken Buck, who won the right to challenge Sen. Michael Bennet in Colorado, currently leads the incumbent by 2.8 points. Former Lt. Gov. Jane Norton, the GOP establishment choice, leads Bennet by only 0.3 percentage points in a theoretical matchup. Kentucky's Rand Paul leads Democrat Jack Conway by 2.5 points, and while Paul's defeated rival Trey Grayson often led by more, Paul has come back from trailing Conway when he first entered the race. The only member of the triumvirate trailing in the polls is Nevada's Sharron Angle, who's down by two. But by the time Angle won the primary, Reid was also beating the once-front-runner, Sue Lowden. The Angle-Lowden situation explains much of what's happening here. The party favorites, in some races, are terrible campaigners. Kentucky's Grayson, tipped as a national star for years, turned in a whining, fumbling debut performance, once griping about Paul's endorsement from Sarah Palin, and once complaining that the media didn't ask him as many easy questions as it asked Paul. Lowden imploded--with prodding from Reid's nuclear-strength oppo team--after suggesting that a goods-for-services bartering system could replace ""ObamaCare,"" and getting tied in knots about what this meant. Norton made an unconvincing pilgrimage to the right, a source of great amusement to activists who remembered her 2005 support of a tax-raising ballot initiative. But in another sense, Paul, Angle, and Buck are unrepresentative of the movement they're co-opting: They are the best, not the norm of Tea Party candidacies. Most of the novice politicians who've run on Tea Party support have tumbled into lopsided primary defeats. (Angle is not a novice but lost several campaigns before hitching herself to the Tea Party Express.) The winners have built on the new, demanding, what's-your-position-on-the-Fed base with real grass-roots campaigns and busy, hustling campaign schedules. A candidate who sees a tide and rides it might also be a good candidate. Democrats argue that the talent that got them through primaries won't work in general elections. Markos Moulitsas, whose Daily Kos blog and bloggers fought the good fight against 2006's lame establishment Democrats--he co-wrote a book about it,  Crashing the Gate--argues that the Tea Party has put more seats into play. ""It's a bad climate,"" said Moulitsas. ""But the teabaggers are throwing Democrats a lifeline. They may still win those seats, but they'll have to fight a lot harder to win them and suck up resources that could've been concentrated in places like Washington and Wisconsin. ... Those seats would've been off the table had Republicans nominated their establishment choices."" Maybe. But Democrats haven't yet fully engaged. This campaign season has yet to see any truly despicable negative ads, and Republicans in 2010 may be more vulnerable to them than Democrats were in 2006. The ""crazy"" thing about Carol Shea-Porter was that she passionately opposed the Iraq war. Lucky for her, so did New Hampshire. The ""crazy"" thing about Angle, by contrast, is that she wants to privatize Social Security, and she's trying to fight back by disingenuously pretending that she doesn't. Still, the success of Shea-Porter--or is it the failure of Jeb Bradley?--should give Democrats pause. ""I don't think anybody in Washington thought I could possibly lose, and I lost,"" said Bradley. ""For everybody who says Sharron Angle or Rand Paul can't win, there's a Jeb Bradley who can prove them wrong."" Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter.

""Right Wing Leaders Plan To Use September 11th Anniversary To Make Money,""writes Lee Fang at ThinkProgress. ""Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck Exploit 9/11 for Profit""reads a headline at Firedoglake. Instant outrage, just add water--although unlike every other news-cycle-burner of the year, there might be some actualoutrage here. Between the Palin/Beck event in Alaska, the launch of a new war-on-terror documentary ( America At Risk: The War With No Name) produced by Newt Gingrich in Washington, a rally against the Park51 Community Center in New York City, and the made-for-cable idiocy in Florida, there is something new about the way the 9/11 anniversary is being played in 2010. Until this year, America basically operated under the impression that politics stopped on Sept. 11. In 2008, Barack Obama's campaign caught some flack for promoting a fundraiser with Warren Buffett that would have been held on the 9/11 anniversary; in public, both his campaign and McCain's campaign were pulling down TV ads. They spent the anniversary attending a solemn memorial at Ground Zero, and that was it. Two years on, that just seems quaint. In New York, Republican gubernatorial candidate Rick Lazio (yes, him) has super-glued his campaign to the spat over the construction of a Muslim community center two blocks from Ground Zero. His commercial on the topic is as subtle as a bazooka, with imagery of the smoking ruins of the World Trade Center as the background for his plea that ""New Yorkers have been through enough."" He's not dropping it as the holiday approaches, and he is one of many politicians holding events and fundraisers tomorrow--as if Sept. 11, 2010, were just another Saturday. If there's been a backlash, no one's noticed it. How did we get from 9/11 as sacred day-of-no-politics to this? With a lot of hard work. For nine years, supporters of an aggressive approach to terrorism as a response to 9/11 worked to make sure that they owned the anniversary. For nine years they got brushback from the media and from the political actors who had the most to lose if 9/11 was seen as proof that ultra-tough conservatives were right and that ultra-tolerant liberals were wrong. And the conservatives won. The early skirmishes came during the 2002 campaign, when several Democrats lost re-election to Republicans who argued that their votes were making Osama bin Laden, wherever he was, happy. The first big spat came in March 2004, when the Bush-Cheney campaign included two seconds of 9/11 imagery in an ad. Cue the outrage. MoveOn.org demanded that ad be taken down, and marshaled some liberal family members of 9/11 victims to make the case. That got Debra Burlingame out of her chair and into the pages of the Wall Street Journal. The sister of the pilot of the jet that crashed into the Pentagon, Burlingame went after the people referred to by the press as ""the 9/11 family members"" in a way no one else had the credibility to do. ""By disingenuously declaring themselves 'non-partisan' and insisting that [anger at the ad] is a matter of 'taste,' "" wrote Burlingame, ""they retain a powerful weapon that they have learned to exploit to their advantage. They are '9/11 family members' and therefore enjoy the cloak of deference that has been graciously conferred upon them by the public, politicians and, most significantly, the media."" Burlingame's column notwithstanding, the Bush ad stayed off the air. Using any imagery from 9/11 remained a good way for a candidate to get involved in a controversy, typically the kind of controversy that cost him votes. One example: Rudy Giuliani's imploding presidential campaign was seen as proof that 9/11 politicking just didn't work, and his campaign spent days denouncing a third-party fundraiser that asked supporters to give him donations ending in $9.11. The rule of 9/11 politicking used to be simple: Leave it up to 9/11 family members to denounce any politicking on or about the event. That's just not the case anymore. Supporters of the ""war on terror,"" as formulated by the Bush administration, don't back down when they're accused of ""exploiting"" 9/11. They have no choice, you see: If they don't use the anniversary to make their argument, then they're partly responsible for allowing Obama's policies to make America less safe. When I talked to Burlingame this week, she suggested that the failure of people like her to point this out meant that the ""narrative"" of 9/11 would continue to drift away from the one that Americans bought in 2001: There was a clash of civilizations, and winning it meant paying any price. And she argued that the idea of a ""truce"" on 9/11 politicking before this year was a ruse. ""Somebody just said to me, the other day, that it was so nice that Barack Obama and John McCain stopped campaigning on 9/11"" in 2008, said Burlingame. ""I laughed at that. Really? You think that wasn't political? It was a joint campaign appearance! They were both campaigning for themselves."" Is Burlingame right? Was the 9/11 politicking truce just politicking by other means? If you nudge Republicans, they'll admit that they crossed their fingers and hoped for poll boosts in 2004 and 2006 after the anniversary. They might even admit that the timing of the 2004 Republican convention, pushed to the latest-possible date at the start of September, was meant to ride the momentum of the anniversary--tastefully, of course! It's worth going all the way back to the weeks after the 2001 attacks, when politics supposedly stopped cold. Sept. 11 was the date of the New York City primary, which four Democratic mayoral candidates were scrambling to win. Voters had been going to the polls for an hour when Flight 175 crashed into the South Tower. The city locked down; the election was postponed to Sept. 25. And the candidates stopped stumping for votes. ""The campaign is over,"" said a spokesman for eventual Democratic nominee Mark Green on Sept. 13, ""Now we'll have an election."" Maybe that thinking was one of the reasons Green lost. The campaign wasn't over. It had become a campaign about 9/11. Mayor Rudy Giuliani floated the idea of staying on as mayor, and Green was slow to reject it (although he eventually did). Green's rival, Freddy Ferrer, made a play for nervous voters by pledging to put Giuliani on a ""recovery board"" after the election. When Green attempted to touch the 9/11 ""issue,"" he got burned--he was mocked for saying that, if he were mayor, he could have rallied the city like Giuliani did, and he was attacked after Bill Bratton, Giuliani's former police commissioner who'd endorsed Green, said the Democrat could better prepare the city for terror threats than Republican rival Michael Bloomberg could. Having never led in pre-election polls, Bloomberg beat Green. Looking back, that seems inevitable. It's much harder for Democrats to finesse 9/11 politics, because the anniversary appeals to inchoate, patriotic anger that only Republicans promise they're going to act on. It's the same anger that led to Republican support for the war in Iraq and for Toby Keith songs--or, if they're desperate, Darryl Worley songs. Those liberal attempts at making 9/11 a ""day of service"" and trying (with little success) to convince people that a ""Ground Zero mosque"" is OK? Well, Republicans see right through that. Liberals want a 9/11 ""truce"" because the truce is the only way for them to win. So the truce is over. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	Why 9/11 is no longer a day free of politics.

17	17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/09/revolution_for_sale.html	"The National Tea Party Convention in Nashville, Tenn., started small and started scandalous. Its organizers, small-time attorney Judson Phillips and his wife, Sherry, booked Sarah Palin as a keynote speaker. Next, they drowned under media requests about how much she'd be paid and why tickets were so expensive--$549 for a full pass, $349 just to see her speech. Many activists howled that this was a sham convention. The mainstream media was less sure, and more than 200 reporters, including plenty of foreign press, decided that this would be a great way to file that Tea Party story their editors were asking for. On the floor of the convention, the ratio was roughly one hack for every three activists. Among the hacks were Will Bunch, a reporter for the Philadelphia Daily News, and me. I joined the rest of the herd and filed hourly updates from Nashville, joining the scrums to talk to political has-beens like Tom Tancredo and Roy Moore, fighting for space with FlipCams and live-tweeters. Bunch was there, too, battling laryngitis as he conducted interviews and filled his notebook. What he learned can be found in his new book,  The Backlash: Right-Wing Radicals, High-Def Hucksters, and Paranoid Politics in the Age of Obama. The rest of the press, he argues, got distracted by Palin and failed to notice the hucksters. ""[T]he second wave of the Tea Party, which had its coming-out amid the central Tennessee woodlands, was chock full of opportunists, especially of the capitalist variety,"" Bunch writes. ""And in the burst of the energy that was the anti-Obama backlash they saw a different kind of rebirth, which was career reinvention powered by a large new pool of potential customers."" The story wasn't Palin's speech. It was Palin's situation: ""She hadn't lost her job, as so many people in the movement had--but rather she quit it when she saw a lucrative opportunity come along."" The Backlash is not the first book-length attempt to understand the Tea Party movement. It's one wave in a flood of books, which began with a memoir by an organizer of the Feb. 27, 2009, Tea Party in Washington ( A New American Tea Party), a these-people-are-crazy take on the new conservative movement ( Over the Cliff: How Obama's Election Drove the American Right Insane), and a ""manifesto"" by the leaders of FreedomWorks ( Give Us Liberty: A Tea Party Manifesto). It hit shelves at the end of August and is joined next week by  Boiling Mad: Inside Tea Party America, by Kate Zernike of the New York Times. In a few weeks, they'll be crowded out by more Tea Party tell-alls. But The Backlash and Boiling Mad read less like cash-ins and more like real histories of the movement. Bunch and Zernike both have Pulitzers on their shelves, as reporters on teams that won for spot news and explanatory reporting. Both of them got on the road, sat through meetings, and did long interviews with activists who were mocked or ignored outside of Fox News. And both books read like the reporters were overwhelmed. The Tea Party is the first true new media movement. It's the first mass uprising to organize outside and against the press, because--according to the helpful New York Times poll reprinted in Zernike's book--it doesn't trust it and it doesn't need it. Activists find out about meetings through Facebook or TaxDayTeaParty.com, and come armed with information from WorldNetDaily or Glenn Beck's multiplatform factoid machine. They'll still talk to reporters, because appearing in print still adds a kind of credibility and fame that can promote the movement. There's just no pretense that the activist needs the media to succeed. (Also, during the reporting of his book, Bunch became a fellow at Media Matters, which will probably allow most activists to dismiss him as an agent of S.O.R.O.S.) Bunch tries his best to prove that the hacks are still needed for something, whether or not the movement wants to admit it. The Backlash is not an attack on the movement. It's a plea for the people inside the movement to realize they're being taken advantage of. The work of reporting that most resembles his project--and this really won't convince conservatives to pick it up--is Michael Moore's  Bowling for Columbine. Bunch and Moore both end up arguing that the Middle Americans who so terrify liberals are simply being misled. Still, if liberals want to read this book for the stories of crazies being crazy, they're in here. Bunch goes beyond Nashville to the Knob Creek Machine Gun Shoot in Kentucky, to the Pittsburgh suburb that produced the deranged cop-killer Richard Poplawski, and to the Arizona political rallies where, for a little while, it looked like J.D. Hayworth would capitalize on recession-driven immigration panic and oust John McCain. But Bunch, writing for a liberal audience, understands exactly why two years of surging unemployment would lead people to right-wing populism. He just thinks they're being scammed. Strike that--he knows they are, because of people like Bill Heid, who made $5 million off of a get-skinny scheme called the ""Himalayan Diet Breakthrough"" and is now selling ""survivalist seeds"" (""More valuable than silver or gold in a real meltdown""). And isn't it a coincidence that a politician like Rep. Paul Broun, R-Ga., whom Bunch reveals as an awkward panderer who bails on a local event because he has to go to a Tea Party outside of his district, answers questions about joblessness with a bunch of misdirection about ""communism""? Zernike's take on the movement isn't nearly so cynical. It's also not so interesting. Zernike started covering the conservative beat in November 2009, and she worked it well, showing up to obvious events like Sarah Palin's  Going Rogue tour and under-the-radar stirrings like a Pennsylvania group's effort to replace its local Republican leadership. (The tick-tock of how that worked--or rather, didn't-- is the best part of her book.) Her problem is that she doesn't go much deeper than her initial, beat-the-deadline articles. The key figures in the history of the movement are, happily enough, the people who gave her access. She gives serious exposure to the not-altogether-interesting story of Jeff McQueen, a Michigan activist who slapped a roman numeral ""II"" inside of Betsy Ross's 1776 flag design--the circle of 13 stars representing the colonies. ""It had become popular at Tea Party events across the country,"" writes Zernike, although it's really only omnipresent in the places where McQueen has handed it out. (On Tea Party Web sites, he excitedly reports how he gave one to Piper Palin ""with permission."") Bunch's criticism of the movement he's covering is sad and convincing. Zernike's is rote. ""While some Tea Partiers focused on the income tax,"" she writes, ""they did not typically mention that under the most literal reading of the Constitution, the country could not have an air force."" She has the best history of FreedomWorks ever put on paper, but little about Glenn Beck's 9-12 Project and nothing about Americans for Prosperity. Matt Kibbe of FreedomWorks has floated the idea of joint appearances with Zernike, which makes perfect sense. The friendly treatment that Tea Partiers get here is reminiscent of nothing so much as one of those flattering books about celebrities penned before they fall from grace and their ex-bodyguards cash in on their stories. But this is a movement that's writing its own history and shouting the media down when they report unflattering things. The most famous example came when Zernike's paper walked back a reference to racial slurs that several African-American congressmen claimed to have heard during the final vote on health care reform. Tea Partiers denied the slurs were shouted and argued that the lack of video evidence proved it, so the ""official"" story was changed. Boiling Mad makes a compromise with the movement it covers. Activists explain why they're angry and present their evidence. The author reports what she sees and learns. The Backlash asks more and better questions, because it identifies the ""pyramid of hucksters"" and ""needless anxieties"" that distort economic angst into a crisis of faith in government and the press. It used to be up to reporters to decide whether a movement was succeeding by doling out coverage and declaring which leaders were outside of the mainstream, as William F. Buckley did to the Birchers or Michael Kelly did to International A.N.S.W.E.R. How much longer, though, will it even be up to reporters to make those judgments? Like Slate on  Facebook.

18	18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/09/dogday_democrats.html	"Cars, a dog, a Slurpee and the fish in the sea: These are just some of the topics President Obama touched on in his feisty Labor Day speech. With 58 days until the election, he has time to bring in a marching band or a kung-fu fight. Before the Milwaukee speech, a senior White House official said that the holiday kick-off to the final campaign sprint would allow Obama to break out of the trappings of the office that sometimes limit what a president can say. In campaign mode, the president would be ""liberated."" He was. ""They treat me like a dog,""he said of the special interests who opposed his programs like Wall Street reform. He joked that the expression wasn't in his prepared remarks. (This is not Obama's first time with the dog talk. But the phrase is actually most famously found in Jimi Hendrix's song of liberation, ""Stone Free."") This was the Obama Democrats have been waiting for. ""That was definitely the most fired up I've seen him since he's been president,"" said Eddie Vale, the AFL-CIO's political communications director who attended the event. ""It was like he was back in the '08 campaign."" I've heard this enthusiasm before over the last few months. Each time Obama has amped up his political rhetoric, Democrats have heralded the star player of the 2008 season's return to the field.  I heard it when he made the final decision to push through health care reform without Republican support, and when he took on Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell over Wall Street reform. * But each time, the elated soon became dejected. The push wasn't sustained. Obama stepped back off the field. What will happen this time? Will the president stay in campaign mode, pressing the case against Republicans, or will he retreat after this week? Before the Monday speech, it wasn't hard to find Democrats in the House and Senate who had races on their hands and were irritated with the president's level of involvement. It wasn't that they thought he was making a strategic mistake by lying low to deprive Republicans of a target. They accused him of lack of interest and neglect. ""There's not a thing he's done in the last two weeks that has won us a single vote,"" said one strategist before listing every Obama distraction, from the Oval Office renovation to his comments about the Islamic cultural center in downtown New York. His allies searched for motives: He didn't want to ruin his chances for 2012 by getting too political. Some ascribed it to a personality flaw: He just didn't like the business of politics (they passed around E.J. Dionne's saying Obama needed to get his hands dirty). Now they're passing around the text and video of Obama's Labor Day speech. The president has tested out the themes and jokes he used in the Milwaukee speech in previous venues (usually partisan fundraisers). What seemed to make it work in front of the crowd of 10,000 was his level of engagement. Democratic voters need to believe that they can keep control of Congress despite the bad poll numbers. Obama, who is taking a pounding in the polls, looked like a man who had a secret to the comeback. He sounded like a happy warrior, laughing at his jokes before he'd told them. He even did voices, embellishing his tale about Republicans who drove the economy into the ditch. ""We're sweating, and these guys were watching us and sipping on a Slurpee,"" he said to crowd laughter before impersonating his uptight GOP opponents. ""And they're pointing at us and saying 'How come you're not pushing harder?' "" This is the attitude we saw from Obama in the final stages of the presidential campaign, when he was opening up a big lead against John McCain. (""Senator McCain bragged that as chairman of the Senate commerce committee he had oversight of every part of the economy,"" Obama used to say. ""All I can say to Senator McCain is, 'Nice job.' "") Now though, it is Obama and his party who, like McCain, read day after day of political coverage about their approaching doom. (Polls by the Washington Post/ABC News and Wall Street Journal/NBC News delivered more grim news today.) Obama did more in the speech than offer laughs, though. He appealed to the crowd's emotions. He talked about the firefighters, teachers, and police officers whose jobs were saved by the Recovery Act. When he talked about people without a job, he spoke about helping the less fortunate in ways that echoed his speech to the House Democrats before the health care vote. ""Those are the folks I got into politics for,"" he told the crowd. ""You are the reason I'm here."" This is why these speeches remind people of the Obama of 2008 and even 2007. He is able to take them past the disappointments and distractions of the moment and remind them why they do what they do, why it's possible to still have hope. If the Democratic ground game is going to save the party from a big defeat, as David Plouffe explains in a video to the ground troops this week, then Obama is going to have to provide the energy and enthusiasm. Tomorrow president Obama travels to Cleveland. He will take on House Minority Leader John Boehner, who attacked the administration's economic policies from there several weeks ago. The visit delights Boehner and his aides, who said that if the president was going to this much trouble, he must be desperate. White House aides say the president isn't elevating his opponent to his level but crystallizing that the election is a choice, a message they've been trying to get across for months. ""Up until now it's been us against the world,"" says a senior administration official. ""It shouldn't be our vision against nothing. It should be our vision against their vision. Now is the time to start attaching some of the baggage that's only so far attached to us."" The key thrust of Obama's argument is that Republicans have no new ideas, and that from the start of his presidency they have reflexively opposed him. ""If I said the sky was blue, they'd say no,"" Obama told the crowd. ""If I said fish live in the sea, they'd say no."" So far, this argument doesn't seem to be working. Though Republicans have been coy about their future plans and no less obstructionist, polls show voters moving to them on the issues anyway. In a CNN/Opinion Research poll, 46 percent of Americans said that Republicans in Congress would do a better job handling economic issues, while 43 percent said that Democrats would. A year ago, Democrats held a 52 percent to 39 percent advantage. In a Washington Post/ABC News poll, Republicans now ""run about evenly with Democrats on the question of which party they trust to handle the nation's biggest problems."" Some 40 percent of registered voters say they have more confidence in Democrats, and 38 percent say they have more trust in Republicans. Three months ago, Democrats had a 12-point advantage. At the end of his Labor Day speech, the president promised that he was going to travel the country until Election Day, making his case. But it's not clear exactly how much effort he'll put forward. A White House official said that unlike Bill Clinton in 1994, Obama would not be visiting three or four cities a day in the final month before the election. Given Obama's unpopularity in lots of contested districts too much exposure could be a bad thing. Whatever his final level of exertion he's got to do enough at least so that after November his allies aren't the ones talking about him like a dog.

19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/09/small_state_big_stakes.html	"WILMINGTON, Del.--Mike Castle is in his element. It's Saturday and Delaware's only representative in the U.S. House has positioned himself at the entrance to the Arden Fair, a 103-year-old celebration of a left-leaning artist community with a jam band, beer garden, and row after row of homemade fudge and jewelry. As he shakes hands, the eight-term Republican, now running for the Senate seat vacated by Joe Biden, competes for attention with three other candidates and the occasional merchant wearing a wizard's cap and cloak. He usually wins. ""Generally speaking, I get recognized,"" says Castle. ""If they show no sign of recognition, I assume they're not from Delaware."" He shakes a few more hands and amends the statement. ""Don't get me wrong, there are people who don't recognize me! Some of these kids, for example."" In a typical election year, recognition is all Castle needs to win. A former state representative, state senator, lieutenant governor, and governor, Castle has not lost an election since he entered politics during the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson. He has not trailed in any polls in his current campaign. The voters who come up and talk to him remember the time they met him at the opera house, or the phone call he made to them after they wrote letters, or the work he's done on some issue like special-needs education. Several people introduce themselves as Democrats and admit--always using the same phrasing--that ""you're the only Republican I vote for."" ""The whole community, Arden, is based on a liberal philosophy, as you know,"" says Castle, shaking hands. ""But I would imagine a great percentage of people who come here are not residents of Arden. It's probably not a Tea Party haven, either."" The woman he was shaking hands with smiles conspiratorially--she wants to give him some advice about the particular Tea Party candidate running against Castle in his Republican primary, the candidate who has spent a year going after him and who has spent the last week on the defensive. ""Stop giving Christine O'Donnell such a hard time!""""Ohhhh,"" Castle sighs. ""It's such a shame, isn't it?"" And that's all Castle really wants to say about O'Donnell, a Republican strategist and pundit who's making her third long-shot bid for office. In 2006 and 2008 she ran for Senate and got nowhere--as the sacrificial lamb against Joe Biden, she lost by a 40-point margin, the largest of any of Biden's seven campaigns. Castle, who won re-election to the House the same day, ran 90,000 votes ahead of O'Donnell. When she declined to stand aside for Castle, who's been eying an open Senate seat for years, the party ignored her. It stopped ignoring her last month. In Alaska, Joe Miller, a conservative attorney and failed local candidate, defied predictions and polls in order to beat Sen. Lisa Murkowski in the GOP primary. The Tea Party Express, the political arm of the movement that had spent $550,000 on ads to help Miller, declared victory and planted a new flag in Delaware. O'Donnell, the group announced, would be the movement's new cause, with ads and fundraising drives that would push her over the top. The Republican establishment woke up and turned the cannons. The Delaware Republican Party started issuing brutal theses about O'Donnell's 2008 campaign debts, her gaffes, and the fact that she still hadn't gotten her college degree after paying off loans for 13 years. (She got it last week.) Dan Gaffney, a conservative local radio host, asked O'Donnell to respond to the attacks in a morning interview; O'Donnell called him a ""sell-out"" and asked, ""Has Castle gotten to you, too?"" She told the Weekly Standard's John McCormack that video trackers were hounding her and even stalking her campaign office, the address of which she does not reveal for security reasons. The state GOP called her ""delusional."" The National Republican Senatorial Committee made sure that Beltway politicos were watching all of this. The News Journal, the Wilmington newspaper that serves most of the state, has run story after story on the front page about O'Donnell's troubles. The voters who stop to chat with Castle have a rock-solid faith that those stories will sink her. ""I want to say one thing to you,"" says one voter. ""Delusional."" Castle laughs sheepishly. ""Well, I didn't say that! Those were not my words."" There's something almost quaint about this faith in the local media, especially when O'Donnell's supporters are asked about the same stories. They, like many members of the Tea Party movement, don't think that information in newspapers is definitive; it may even be inferior to what they hear from their friends or from talk radio. This is one of many reasons why Castle gets along with these activists the way a negotiator might deal with a hostage-taker. ""Some of the things they seem to advocate go beyond the norm,"" says Castle. ""I have trouble distinguishing sometimes between the factions out there that are in this ultra-conservative mode. You know--be it the patriots, or this Tea Party Express, or the different factions of the Tea Party. I've seen advocacy for eliminating the Department of Education, for example."" He's interrupted again--""Hi, Debbie!""--but keeps musing on how Tea Party activists shout down legislation by saying it's unconstitutional. ""There are a lot of things that the federal government does that, you know, might not be explicitly in the Constitution per se,"" says Castle. ""There are a lot of things that the states do, too. And they've been doing it in some cases since the 18th century."" He shrugs. ""I do suppose it is a good question to ask."" The next day, about an hour's drive south of Wilmington in a Camden, Del., park, a dozen or so of the activists asking those questions are gathering to organize for O'Donnell. Two of her supporters, Jill and Carmen Bianchi, have brought sandwiches, soda, and chips to feed the volunteers; nearby, a dozen teenagers are swinging swords and shields in a game of live action role-playing. When she arrives to meet them, O'Donnell brings a pound cake and apologizes for not having baked it herself. She happily points out the tracker that Republicans have sent to follow her. Her short speech is light on policy, all about momentum and the media--slightly outdated polls that show her holding the seat if she's her party's nominee, the ""mud-slinging"" tone of the race. She tells the crowd about a Vietnam veteran named George who told her he was as angry about the state of the country as he'd been about being spit on when he returned from the war. ""He reminded me why we too need to continue to take the hits,"" says O'Donnell. ""You were spit on for defending your country. We'll be slandered for defending our country. But what I want to do for you, George, is restore honor back to America.""* That's exactly what this crowd wants to hear, and it murmurs with approval. Many of these activists went to Glenn Beck's ""Restoring Honor"" rally in Washington the weekend before. O'Donnell did, too, but unlike them she got to meet Sarah Palin. Her campaign team is led by Matt Moran, a veteran of Doug Hoffman's 2009 upstart third-party campaign in New York's 23rd congressional district. They hope that the GOP onslaught on O'Donnell won't stop powerful conservatives from weighing in for her. Those endorsements could provide exactly what O'Donnell is missing in her quest to turn what was a fringe candidacy into a giant-killing one. She needs more credibility. After the picnic, at a large Sunday crowd at a Masonic hall, O'Donnell struggles a bit to convince conservative voters that their desire to punish Republicans In Name Only is enough to elect her. She rattles off a political biography that doesn't get much response, going through her work for Haley Barbour at the RNC in the 1990s and for Mel Gibson's Icon Productions when it was marketing  The Passion of the Christ. Even when talking about repealing the Democrats' health-care bill--an easy applause line for this audience--she takes her answer to a place that the crowd doesn't want to go, musing about how Hillary Clinton might challenge Obama in 2012 if he vetoes a repeal bill. ""There might be a certain blonde secretary taking a leave and running in 2012!"" says O'Donnell. It's a pundit's answer, not a politician's. It leaves Lance Wilgus, who asked the question, a little confused. ""I won't vote for Castle,"" he says. ""But I haven't decided who I will vote for yet."" Turnout for the GOP primary may be as low as 45,000. It's clear that there are enough conservatives in Delaware to prevent Castle from ascending to the Senate if they want to. It's just not clear that O'Donnell is their candidate.Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter.

20	20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/09/still_life_with_enemy_combatant.html	I broke a rule at Guantanamo, and it was worth it: I chose to wear shorts for my tour of the detention facilities at Camp Delta. Who can blame me? The sun was high and the mercury was inching toward 100, and Gitmo's rules for reporters change on an hourly basis. The public affairs officers at the media center told me and the other journalists that shorts were acceptable attire for our visit. As soon as we arrived at Camp Delta, we spotted a weathered sign at the front gate that tallied the don'ts: no shorts, no open-toed shoes, and no orange clothing (lest you be confused with the prisoners). But despite the sign, and perhaps to keep us from rioting, our military handlers told us our shorts would not have been a problem--except for that particular day. Ramadan had just started, and our handlers had decided to honor the rules; our bare calves would not be allowed. Feeling dumb, I watched sadly as our group split in half. The clad-calved walked toward the jail cells, while we rule-breakers were escorted into Camp Delta's library, where prisoners can choose from a collection of 18,000 books, films, and newspapers. It's also where journalists are brought to see the lighter side of indefinite detention. As we ambled around and viewed shelves of tattered Arabic religious texts, copies of  Harry Potterin many languages, and a book named  Azaleas, Rhododendrons & Camellias, a soldier from upstate New York cheerfully directed our attention toward a wall of drawings. These drawings were from prisoners' art classes, the soldier explained. Prisoners were allowed to take art classes as a reward for good behavior. Some of the drawings and paintings were quite impressive. The prisoners had a lot of time to practice, he admitted. Until recently, taking photos of these drawings was forbidden. But in the weeks before a planeload of journalists arrived in Gitmo to cover the trial of Omar Khadr, the 23-year-old prisoner whose case is being heard by a tribunal court after nearly eight years in detention, that rule changed. The drawings were deemed safe for public consumption. Navy Cmdr. Bradley Fagan, the chief of Guantanamo's Public Affairs Office, declined later to explain exactly how the art was screened. But the guards at the library suggested that it was checked for identifying information, references to violence, or any sort of coded message. The identity of these artists is not disclosed, so we have no way of knowing whether any of the still lifes or studies in vanishing points are the work of celebrity detainees like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed or the lesser-known among the 176 remaining prisoners at Gitmo. It's still against the rules to photograph and speak to the prisoners, so we may never know if the beaches, lanterns, and Middle Eastern lanes of the drawings convey the inner life of the average prisoner. But for now, this handful of drawings is one of the few views of what life is like behind the barbed wire of Guantanamo Bay's detention center.

21	21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/08/the_kochs_should_come_out_of_the_closet.html	"Congratulations, libertarians! August 2010 was the month when you joined an exclusive club: people accused of shilling for amoral and scary billionaires. It really shouldn't have been a new or bracing experience for you. People have been mocking libertarians for years. This month, though, you got it from both barrels of what Andrew Breitbart likes to call the Democrat-Media Complex. On Aug. 9, President Obama spoke at a fundraiser in Texas and warned Democrats of ""groups with harmless-sounding names like Americans for Prosperity"" with shadowy funding sources and the power to distort elections. ""You don't know if it's a foreign-controlled corporation,"" said Obama. ""You don't know if it's a big oil company, or a big bank."" Just two weeks later, The New Yorker published a 10,000 word profile of David and Charles Koch, the billionaires who have poured profits from their oil, chemical, and manufacturing companies into a network of libertarian think tanks and activist groups--such as, for example, Americans for Prosperity. Again, nothing truly new there. But the reaction was angrier than a John Galt speech. AFP President Tim Phillips accused the president of ""making shrill, desperate attacks on Americans for Prosperity and our 1,200,000 AFP grassroots activists across the nation."" Reason magazine, where I worked from 2006 to 2008 (and for which I am still a contributing editor), responded with multiple blog posts attacking the New Yorker profile. ""The story is a masterpiece not of the tightly researched and argued journalism for which The New Yorker is revered,"" writes Reason.com and Reason.tv Editor-in-Chief Nick Gillespie, ""but of sly innuendo and revelations as lame as they are breathless."" Gillespie does a fine job of picking apart the New Yorker article. It also includes this disclosure: ""David Koch has been on the board of trustees of Reason Foundation, the publisher of this website, for decades, and his name appears in the masthead of Reason magazine; I have also taught at various programs for the Institute for Humane Studies, which the Kochs fund, and will speak at an Americans for Prosperity event later this week."" That's exactly what the enemies of Koch want to hear--proof that the brothers are members of the illuminati, cackling as their influence spreads across the political landscape. Libertarians had better get used to this. The Kochs are now in the pantheon of Evil Rich Benefactors, exposed for everything they fund and accused of funding everything their opponents don't like. (FreedomWorks, which exists because it wanted to break away from Koch and AFP, is constantly and wrongly accused of taking Koch money.) And that means that the response so far--lots of shock and denial and dismissal and some griping about personal attacks--won't really work. The Kochs' defenders should look at other cases in which well-meaning billionaires became Emmanuel Goldsteins and adjust their strategies accordingly. Exhibit A: Richard Mellon Scaife. In the early 1970s, the Pittsburgh tycoon and conservative activist realized that his aid to the Republican Party didn't mean much if liberals controlled academia, the media, and Washington think tanks. He was merely the wealthiest of many donors who started pouring serious money into organizations like the Heritage Foundation. It wasn't until 1986 that journalists fully realized the power of what Scaife was doing, and it wasn't until the 1990s that Scaife himself was really demonized. The reason? He was putting millions of dollars into the American Spectator and other media outlets that obsessed over the sexual life of Bill Clinton. The Democrats went to war, much more aggressively than Obama has so far against the Kochs, starting with an (in)famous document, brandished by then First Lady Hillary Clinton on The TodayShow in 1998, detailing the ""vast right wing conspiracy."" Scaife didn't handle it especially well. His media strategy was simple: say nothing. Reporters thus filled in the blanks around him. Neither he nor his beneficiaries liked what those blanks were filled with, and ""Scaife money"" became a byword for ""part of a conservative conspiracy."" Exhibit B: George Soros. Until 2003, Soros was best-known as a well-meaning hedge-fund manager who funded democracy efforts in the former Soviet Union. Then he announced that defeating President George W. Bush was a ""matter of life and death"" and donated $18 million to such projects as MoveOn.org and the Center for American Progress--big liberal projects that had been launched to battle, ironically, the projects that Scaife had funded. In no time at all, he became a left-wing boogeyman, inspiring follow-the-bouncing-dollars investigations from conservatives and watching his biography get twisted into something resembling an Erich von Stroheim character. One sample from the biography posted at communist-turned-conservative David Horowitz's ""Discover the Networks"" project: ""While hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews were being transported to death camps, George Soros accompanied his make-believe godfather on his appointed rounds, confiscating property from the Jews."" Soros took Scaife's script and flipped it. Instead of hiding, he wrote a book and embarked on a speaking tour right before the 2004 election. That was just what conservatives hoped he'd do, because they'd spent a year calling him the ""Daddy Warbucks of the Democratic Party"" and because his voice bore a striking resemblance to Bela Lugosi's. (Conveniently, in the Age of Drudge, close-ups of Soros made him look like a madman.) And so six years later, Soros remains so infamous that conservatives still use him in their attempts to discredit liberal projects regardless of whether he gave them any money. What should the Kochs and their benefactors take from all this? Maybe they can split the difference between Scaife and Soros. While TheNew Yorker may have oversold how secretive the Kochs are, it also notes that ""the Kochs and their political operatives declined requests for interviews."" It also doesn't help that when the Kochs are referred to as sponsors of the Tea Party movement, their press shop pushes out denials. Koch's beneficiaries deny that they have any strings and accuse Koch foes of distraction and personal destruction. Sure, that's what it is. And it's going to keep happening because the Koch strategy is working. Toss a hunk of Rearden metal at a D.C. libertarian organization or scholar and you'll hit something connected to the Kochs.

Bush will publish a memoir,  Decision Points, in which he will try to put the tough moments of his presidency into perspective. His successor is already helping. On Sunday, President Obama spoke in New Orleans to commemorate the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. On Tuesday, he will speak to the nation about the final stage of the Iraq war. The back-to-back events could be called the Cleaning Up Bush's Messes Tour--what many Democrats would call the entire Obama presidency so far--and yet both events highlight Obama's struggles with disaster and war, potentially putting his predecessor in a more favorable light. The bar starts low for Bush. The federal response to Katrina and Bush's decision to invade Iraq are signature fiascoes of his presidency, partly responsible for a political climate welcoming to an anti-Bush candidate like Obama. The simple passage of time also helps Bush's standing, as people forget their anger, encounter new things to worry about, or find themselves longing for traits they once despised after being deprived of them for 19 months. As for Obama, he is not consciously trying to improve the public's view of the Bush years. Indeed, he is actively reminding people of the mess he inherited from his predecessor. It is a key theme of the entire Democratic campaign. At the same time, as Obama demonstrates the natural limits of presidential action, he unwittingly adds perspective to assessments of what President Bush could do. As he benefits from policies he once opposed--such as the surge in Iraq, which helped make tomorrow's speech possible--Obama proves that even a smart politician with the best of intentions can be wrong. And as he champions making tough calls even in the face of popular opposition, he often sounds eerily like his predecessor. The relevant similarity between the federal response to Katrina and the BP oil spill (other than geography) is that both show the limits of the presidency and the federal government. Of course, a hurricane is different from an oil spill, and it's not necessary, for the purposes of comparison, to pass judgment on Bush's or Obama's response. The point is that from a purely logistical standpoint, it's hard to get the federal bureaucracy to move quickly. That's true whether you think the president is uniquely incompetent or a smart manager. A president weighing the benefits and costs of making a visit to the disaster area can catch similar grief for not taking command whether they're photographed in a plane or on a basketball court. And even an eloquent speaker can sound the wrong note. On Tuesday night, president Obama will give a prime time address about Iraq as his predecessor did several times. He will announce the end of the American combat mission, a process started under Bush and which fulfills Obama's promise during the campaign to end the war. It has been more than seven years since Bush celebrated underneath a ""Mission Accomplished"" banner. The bad planning and hubris associated with the Bush administration's adventure in Iraq will fill volumes of brutal assessments. (They've already started.) The desperate situation Obama still faces in Afghanistan is the result of years of neglect and negligence caused by the Iraq war. Yet Obama's announcement Tuesday would not be possible were it not for a strategy that he adamantly opposed. When Bush announced the surge in January 2007, then-Sen. Obama not only fought the increase in troops, he opposed on more than one occasion the underlying approach (already in practice in Iraq) that the new troops were being sent to pursue. Sen. Obama not only expected the surge to fail; he saw it, incorrectly, as yet another example of Bush's inability to adapt to reality. President Obama, at least, does not face that criticism. He has based his strategy in Afghanistan on the same counterinsurgency strategy that was central to Bush's surge. He's done more than borrow his predecessor's strategy--he's also borrowing his language. Of these two quotes, which is Obama and which is Bush?"

24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/08/sarah_palins_tea_party.html	"So maybe Joe Miller is  Chuck Norris after all. Miller, the lantern-jawed candidate of the Tea Party Express and Sarah Palin, defied a lot of expectations yesterday--including my own. With all but a handful of precincts reporting, Miller appears to have beaten incumbent Sen. Lisa Murkowski by two points, 51 percent to 49 percent. Three weeks ago, Murkowski's re-election was all but assured. Miller trailed the moderate senator by 30 points or more in two public polls conducted in July, and through Aug. 4, he had been able to raise only about $283,000 to compete with her total funds of almost $3 million. Micro-scandal after micro-scandal befell the Miller campaign it as it worked to build up his name recognition. Just more than two weeks ago, Miller's campaign manager Paul Bauer got axed when he called a group of University of Alaska-Anchorage College Republicans ""puppets"" and his wife started a feud with an Anchorage conservative talk radio host. At one of his rallies, only nine people showed up. When I spoke to Bauer on Saturday, even he didn't sound optimistic about Miller's chances. ""We didn't talk more about the Alaska issues, and that's where Lisa focused,"" said Bauer, adding, ""I don't think there's a stronger candidate than Joe Miller in the state of Alaska who can go against Lisa Murkowski in a Republican primary ever again."" So, what happened? The most important factor, as usual, was probably money. Murkowski had more of it, but the Tea Party Express spent enough to make a difference. The group put $600,000 into ""Liberal Lisa"" radio and television ads, which helped define Miller's opponent. And while Palin did not campaign for Miller, she and former Lt. Gov. Loren Leman recorded effective 11th-hour robocalls for him. (I got one during dinner earlier this week.) Miller's votes may also have been bolstered by the presence of a parental notification initiative on the ballot. The measure, which would require girls under the age of 17 to inform their parents before obtaining an abortion, was winning approval with about 55 percent of the vote, and it brought out the pro-life vote. Murkowski is considered pro-choice, and as Miller told the Anchorage Daily News, ""Prop. 2 supporters were our supporters, largely."" Meanwhile, Murkowski's own last-minute advertising strategy failed. On Monday, her campaign finally went negative, airing an ad that featured the voice of popular talk radio host Dan Fagan accusing Joe Miller of lying about Murkowski's record on Obamacare. (She voted against health care reform, but Miller says she didn't ask for repeal soon enough.) Unfortunately, after the ad aired--and just a few hours before the polls opened--Fagan endorsed Miller. (He made his decision, he said, ""after further weighing the evidence."") Murkowski's campaign also refrained from airing ads that the late Sen. Ted Stevens had recorded for them before his death. All that said, the fight's not over yet. There are still 16,000 absentee ballots outstanding, and a lot of those votes were cast when Murkowski still had the edge. It's not likely that she'll get the 2,000 votes she needs to win the primary--but then again, what has been likely about this primary? (Recall that in 2008, then-Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich made up a 3,000-vote deficit to beat Sen. Ted Stevens once some 60,000 absentee and mail-in votes were counted.) And then there's the big question: Could Murkowski run as an independent or write-in candidate? Her campaign had yet to return calls this morning, but the strategy worked for two-time Gov. Wally Hickel, who lost the Republican nod in 1990 and then won the general after being recruited as a candidate for the Alaska Independence Party. Murkowski may now find herself in a position not unlike that of Charlie Crist in Florida: a moderate who has (take your pick: abandoned/been abandoned by) her party. Center-right and even some liberal voters may find her more appealing than Democratic candidate and Sitka Mayor Scott McAdams. And if Miller does pull this off? Washington had better be prepared: ""What's a 'Beltway traffic jam'? Is that when a caribou herd crosses a road?"" he tweeted last night. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/08/uncertainty_principle.html	"To get businesses hiring, House Republican leader John Boehner wants firings. First, he wants the president to sack his economic team. Then he'd like the voters to retire or replace 39 or more Democrats so that Republicans can take control of the House. Boehner made his pitch in a much touted speech denouncing the Obama administration's economic policies. The president's economic team just doesn't get it, he argued (a key theme in this election). They've never owned a small business or run a company. They don't understand the uncertainty the president's policies are creating in the private sector. ""America's employers are afraid to invest in an economy stalled by stimulus spending and hamstrung by uncertainty,"" he said in one of nine uses of the word. ""The prospect of higher taxes, stricter rules, and more regulations has employers sitting on their hands."" The argument is not new, but it's one that GOP aides say you're going to hear a lot between now and November. It's founded in economic reality--of course people are uncertain--but frames the economic situation such that the most effective solution is not one specific policy but simply the removal of the party in power. Boehner says businesses are worried about the legislation that has passed and that's likely to come. Health care and financial regulatory reform were enormous bills (more than 2,000 pages each). Much of their impact is still being figured out by the regulatory agencies. The health care law will create more than 100 new regulations, says the Chamber of Commerce, whose president focused on uncertainty in his ""State of American Business"" speech in January. Financial reform will require 520 new rulemakings, 81 studies, and 93 reports. Executives have to wait to hire or invest while all of this is figured out so they'll know how much to spend on benefits and paperwork. The future is also a vast mystery. Only some portion of the Bush tax cuts may expire, but no one knows the exact shape of the new tax code. President Obama has promised to push comprehensive energy legislation founded on putting a price on carbon. His deficit plans, if they're serious, will almost certainly require a rewriting of the tax code and cuts in federal spending. Uncertainty as the cause of all woe resonates with voters even if they don't own businesses, because, broadly speaking, there are jitters in the country. Every day, there seems to be a reminder of the fragile state of things. Tuesday it was reported that home sales dropped 27 percent in July. Almost 60 percent of Americans think the country is headed in the wrong direction. Obama's frenetic activity (""You never want a serious crisis to go to waste,"" said his chief of staff Rahm Emanuel) contributes to the sense of unpredictability. Today energy legislation, tomorrow we switch to the metric system! So stop the madness, Boehner argues. That alone will unleash economic growth. If business can be certain that Obama won't have a congressional majority to put his schemes into legislation, they'll come out from under the desk and start spending all that cash they've been hoarding while they wait for certainty. This advantage of this ballot-box-rescue argument is that it allows Republicans to stay light on specifics about what they would do if all of this firing took place and they had control. Boehner promised there would be a GOP agenda sometime next month, a strategy that gives Democrats limited time before the election to pick apart what's offered (which is likely to be pretty vague, anyway). He did call for spending cuts, but not enough to tackle the deficit, especially if the Bush tax cuts are extended--which the the Congressional Budget Office says will give the economy an initial boost but then cause ""daunting long-term fiscal challenges"" and ""reduce long-term economic growth."" Never mind all that. If the big problem can be solved by electing Republicans, those smaller details can be worked out. The uncertainty argument also helps the GOP get out of a debate about the past. If Obama's actions of the moment and future are to blame, then there's no reason to talk about the policies of the previous administration and GOP Congress that may have created the current economic conditions. In response to Boehner, Vice President Joe Biden mockingly thanked him for his advice about the firings and repeated the administration charge that the GOP merely wants to return to the ""exact same agenda"" of the Bush years. If you really want certainty, say Democrats--or at least incremental change that breeds less uncertainty--then voters should not want to give the GOP control. Republicans have promised to repeal financial regulatory reform and health care reform. If that actually happened, businesses would have to wait for the enormous battle while Republicans tried to push through their replacement legislation. Then executives, accountants, and lawyers would have to plow through yet another pile of regulations to figure out how these repeals worked. Democrats in control with smaller margins would inevitably limit Barack Obama's ambitions. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell actually made that argument recently. Democrats also challenge the economics of Boehner's claim. ""This is an argument that only CEOs make,"" says Robert Shapiro, chairman of Sonecon, an economic advisory firm and a former Clinton-administration official. ""No reputable economist has ever been able to find evidence that business has a sense of uncertainty independent of the economic factors in the real world that businessmen take account of."" Uncertainty is at the heart of business activity, say administration officials. There is more after a recession, and there is particular uncertainty now because the economy is struggling to emerge from a crisis unlike anything seen since the Great Depression. What Boehner is trying to do is blame the Democrats who are handing out umbrellas for the rain that's falling. The uncertainty that people feel, say White House aides, is the result of an economic system that got out of control during the Bush administration. (An administration that was stocked with businessmen from the real world, they add.) Only if the Obama administration's proposals are put in place can natural uncertainty be mitigated, an argument that got a little boost on the day Boehner spoke. The Congressional Budget Office reported that the Recovery Act increased real GDP by up to 4.5 percent in the second quarter of 2010 and put up to 3.3 million people to work possibly preventing the economy from contracting in that period. But the report also said the act's impact on the end of the year will diminish. The future, then, is still uncertain. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter."

26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/08/let_it_lie.html	"With so much traffic on the low road in American politics, you'd imagine a politician or two might take the high road simply to beat the congestion. Sunday on Meet the Press, Mitch McConnell was asked about the Pew poll that showed 31 percent of Republicans believe Obama is a Muslim. He said, ""The president says he's a Christian. I take him at his word. I don't think that's in dispute."" If you only paid attention to his first two sentences, as some pundits did, you might think McConnell was trying to keep doubt alive by suggesting the matter was one of debate. If you were patient enough to listen to the last sentence, you heard him say that the matter is not one of debate at all. If McConnell wasn't trying to stir the pot, he also wasn't trying to lower the boil. What you didn't hear McConnell say was that the whole notion that Obama is a Muslim is ridiculous because by any standard we use to evaluate the religious beliefs of our leaders, President Obama is a Christian. Nor did he go on to say that any politician who tries to benefit from this urban legend--by courting either Islamophobes or conspiracy nuts who think Obama is engaged in some kind of systematic deception--should be ashamed of himself. He also did not produce a baby unicorn. That is to say, expecting the events of the previous paragraph would ever happen in real life is a fantasy. We can define our politics by the outrageous things people say. Rep. Joe Wilson yelled, ""You lie"" during a presidential address to Congress. Newt Gingrich called Sonia Sotomayor a racist, and Democratic Rep. Alan Grayson said, ""Republicans want you to die quickly."" But the shamelessness of our politics can also be measured by silence. It's just as embarrassing that in a case like this, no politician will take the high road against their political interest. Fine. If we can't have Boy Scouts in office, let's try it another way. Shouldn't there be someone taking the high road if for no other reason than it is unoccupied? Often in politics, doing the one thing no one else is doing usually gets you air time and exposure. But it's harder to tread the high road in an election year. For Republicans whose constituents dislike the president, there's no advantage in going out of your way to stick up for him. That's why McConnell kept trying to get back to talking about the economy. He was trying to stay on the issue voters care about. Why is the burden on Republicans? They benefit from the misinformation, and the poll shows the myth has taken hold most sharply among their supporters. If one of them doesn't speak up, we may have to conclude that the GOP will allow any untruth to spread so long as it helps the party. Republicans and conservatives aren't the only ones who don't bother to do the right thing. During the primaries, Hillary Clinton's campaign staffers passed around Obama-is-a-Muslim e-mails. Hillary Clinton gave a McConnell-esque response when asked whether she thought Obama was a Muslim. And Clinton's campaign strategist Mark Penn talked about making Obama's otherness the central pitch of the Clinton campaign. That's part of what the Muslim charge is about--making the president seem like something foreign, mysterious and unfamiliar to Americans. Evangelical Christian leader Franklin Graham bypassed the high road too. Though his father made a career out of sudden conversions to Christ and he has continued that tradition, the younger Graham seemed rather lukewarm about whether Obama's Christian rebirth (described at the end of  Dreams From My Father) really took. Saying Obama was ""born a Muslim"" (in fact, Obama's Muslim-born father and Christian-born mother were both areligious), Graham seemed skeptical of Obama's Christian identity. ""That is what he says he has done,"" said Graham. ""I cannot say that he hasn't. So I just have to believe that the president is what he has said."" Those who doubt Obama's faith practice selective hearing in its highest form. It requires real discipline to hear only Obama's remarks that might identify him in any way with Islam and miss all of the others that refer to his Christian faith. So when the president spoke in Cairo, people heard him say how his father's Kenyan family included generations of Muslims but went la,la,la, la seconds earlier, when Obama declared, ""I'm a Christian."" (A Republican national committeewoman, Kim Lehman, who says she believes Obama is a Muslim, seemed almost religious about her refusal to inform herself about this speech,) During his political career, Obama has been quite comfortable talking about his faith and the particularities of his Christian beliefs. Inviting discussion about this aspect of his life has not always benefited Obama. Two years ago he faced a crisis over connections to his Christian pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. Earlier, in 2006, Obama gave a high-profile speech about his faith and received a wave of criticism from progressives, many of whom compared him to George Bush. It's hard work to sustain doubt about the president's faith or to believe he doesn't express it enough. At one point, Politico reported that Obama had actually invoked Jesus more than Bush. He often talks in personal terms. ""I found myself drawn--not just to work with the church but to be in the church,"" Obama said at Notre Dame in May 2009. ""It was through this service that I was brought to Christ."" Search for Christ on the White House Web site and the first item you'll find is the president's remarks at an Easter prayer breakfast. He didn't just welcome his ""brothers and sisters in Christ,"" but also talked at length about why Christ's resurrection and the power of redemption meant so much to him. Previous presidents may have attended church, but Obama was doing something more. He was witnessing. Different churches may have different practices, but the ones I've attended don't usually greet such expressions of faith with scorn. The usual response is to say Amen.

27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/08/mutual_irritation_society.html	"ORLANDO, Fla.--The people manning the phones at the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades union hall in Orlando keep their heads down, stenciling slogans on poster board and making calls to Democratic primary voters. It takes a minute for them to realize that Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., has just walked in to thank them for their work, un-missable in a black denim blazer, cowboy boots, and an American flag tie. As he walks from desk to desk, he is followed by a two-man documentary crew that has been with him since July 4. One volunteer puts down his phone, picks up a copy of Howard Zinn's  A People's History of the United States, and flips open to the title page. He wants Grayson to sign it. ""Oh, of course!"" says Grayson, scribbling his name on one of the central texts of progressive politics. ""It's one of my favorite books. I've got a copy that has all of my favorite parts highlighted."" He actually does. Grayson was a lawyer and telecommunications executive before he got into politics. (Consequently, he's worth more than $30 million.) He studied politicians like Huey Long and historians like Zinn, and decided he could win by being blunt, liberal, and profligate. In 2010, he's one of the few Democrats nationwide trying to outmatch the passion and organization of the Tea Party movement. Outmaneuvering the Tea Party takes a multipronged strategy. Grayson has tried to work on the problems that inspire the movement while dismissing the movement itself as racist, stupid, and crazy. For example, he says, he has found common ground with Rep. Ron Paul of Texas. ""I agree with him on the wars,"" says Grayson. ""I agree with him on civil liberties. We've worked together very effectively regarding the Fed."" And now here comes the dig. ""Many people, improperly, lump together libertarians and the Tea Parties. That's really wrong. Many of the libertarians are physicists, and many of the Tea Party people don't bathe. There's really not much in common there!"" Local Republicans are, understandably, not amused. Seven of them are competing for the chance to challenge Grayson, and some have even made him the focus of their primary campaigns. State Rep. Kurt Kelly calls himself ""the conservative who can beat Alan Grayson"" and encourages contributors to ""donate today to beat Alan Grayson."" Grayson is also a one-man full employment program for conservative talk radio in the district. On the day that he visited the union hall, Republican contender Todd Long and his campaign manager Phil Russo took over a local AM station for an hour, tearing Grayson apart. ""It would just be a disgrace if Grayson wins,"" says Russo. ""The only people worse than Alan Grayson are Alan Grayson supporters."" This is just what Grayson wants. His re-election strategy: Register more Democrats, knock on their doors, and fire them up by pouring ridicule on the GOP and the Tea Party movement. He appears on CNN and MSNBC regularly, most recently to demand that White House spokesman Robert Gibbs be fired for sneering at the ""professional left."" In a conversation inside one of the union's small offices, he quotes some of his better one-liners about Republicans as ""wingnuts"" who want patients to ""die quickly."" They're offended? He couldn't care less. ""I feel bad sometimes,"" says Grayson, talking to a small group of supporters, ""because I feel like Democrats should have delivered more for the people who supported us. In 2008, 75 percent of the people who voted for me were Democrats. Only 23 percent of Republicans voted for me. What does that tell me? I should be doing the most for the people who voted for me, not the people who voted the other way."" Many Republican candidates respond to Grayson's provocations by trying to ignore them. Long, who has mailed 30,000 voters copies of his book about conservative values, sticks to talking about the congressman's voting record and a poll that suggests Grayson is losing. (Grayson says he's 15 points ahead of the GOP's challengers.) Bruce O'Donoghue, a businessman and first-time candidate, calls Grayson an ""entertainer"" but refuses to respond to Grayson's attacks on Republicans. No one exemplifies this mellow approach to Grayson like the man most people here consider the Republican front-runner, Daniel Webster. He represented most of this district in the state Senate for a generation, then retired, then rode back into the fray when the party begged him to take on Grayson. He'll take him on, but he won't respond to his taunts. Instead, he refers to his experience in the state legislature in a series of koans as he waits for his latest high-profile endorser, Mike Huckabee, to arrive for a rally. ""When you win, regardless about how you feel about who got you there, you're serving them,"" says Webster. ""Don't burn any bridges. Don't make it personal."" Huckabee arrives and tries to make the same point, calling Webster a ""chef in the kitchen"" instead of ""a person who is just serving someone else's food."" His audience seems to understand the metaphor and applauds. Buttoned-down Webster, argues Huckabee, is the obvious antidote to Grayson. ""You don't just have an opportunity here,"" says Huckabee. ""I would say you have an obligation to replace the person you have."" That's how Webster's rivals feel, too. Not even O'Donoghue, who was the front-runner in the GOP primary until Webster jumped in belatedly, wants to say anything bad about him. ""Dan and I are friends,"" he says. ""At least, I thought we were friends!"" He stops himself short. ""I'm just kidding. We're friends. I don't see the fight in Dan, but I love and respect him."" Grayson minimizes the threat he might face from Webster. Liberal donors, he points out, have responded to him by helping him build the biggest war chest of any freshman Democrat. He has $1.3 million stowed away; Webster has about $100,000. Let Webster play moderate, because Grayson has mapped out a way to portray him as an out-of-touch cipher. ""Whoever wins is going to be an extreme right-winger,"" says Grayson. ""Because they're all extreme right-wingers. They couldn't find a normal person to run against me. Every one of these candidates is so far to the right it's as if they're going to fall off the face of the earth."" Few other Democrats in Grayson's position talk like this. Some conversations with voters in the district demonstrate why. In 2008, they voted for Grayson and the Obama-Biden ticket, narrowly, because of disgust with the Bush administration's failures. It was tough to find a job then. It's tougher now. That lends more credibility to the critiques of Republicans like Webster, who promise to kick-start the economy by cutting taxes on businesses and slashing entitlement spending. It's a critique that appeals even to voters like Jeff Evans, 49, who was laid off from his trucking job in December 2009. He was receiving unemployment benefits until a Republican filibuster stopped them this summer, leaving him without a revenue stream for weeks. But even though Grayson and his fellow Democrats eventually restored his benefits, Evans isn't sure he will support Grayson. It would do him more good, he said, and allow him to keep his dignity, if they ""let the small businesses create more jobs."" Grayson knows how popular that argument is. The solution: Argue that Republicans have no credibility to make it. He pivots off of one of Webster's ideas, a proposal to cut the budget to what it was in 2007. Webster suggests that Floridians were perfectly well off when the government spent at that lower level. Grayson prefers to ask whether voters realize that a cut like that would mean lower Social Security payments. ""It's a stupid idea,"" says Grayson. ""Nobody has a time machine, OK? The world has changed a little bit since 2007. For one thing, there're a lot of more people out of work."" Soon he's on a roll, explaining how $12 trillion of capital disappeared in the ""Bush implosion"" of 2008. That's who voters need to blame, he says. Why aren't they as angry as he is? ""In 18 months, two centuries of work, the collective effort of millions of people, all gone,"" says Grayson of the financial crisis. ""So now the Republicans want to go back to 2007? It's a little bit late for that."" When he's done talking to me, Grayson talks with more volunteers. He poses for more photos with them. About a dozen wear T-shirts that say ""Grayson. Truth."" Everywhere they go, they're presented with evidence that voters blame their party for the economic mess, and here he is, the Democrat who's defending what his party's trying to do. ""He irritates the Republicans,"" says one volunteer, special education teacher Audrey Ais. ""They need to be irritated! They spend plenty of time irritating us."" Like Slate on  Facebook.

28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/08/a_mosque_you_cant_believe_in.html	"James K. Glassman is a rarity: a Republican who believes, and is willing to say, that President Obama ""is the greatest public diplomat we've had in decades."" Glassman, who served as undersecretary for public diplomacy under George W. Bush, also believes that the controversy over the planned Islamic community center will hurt the U.S. image among Muslims abroad. And he believes that Obama's task, like his predecessor's, is to replace the conspiratorial narrative about a United States as an enemy of Islam with one in which a tolerant, freedom-loving country does right by Muslims. The problem--for the White House, for mosque supporters, for basically everyone--is that so few people believe this is possible. Over the weekend, Politico's Ben Smith and Maggie Haberman pointed out the Republican defenders of the ""ground zero mosque"" were vastly outnumbered by Republicans who catered to ""hostility toward Islam among many Republican voters"" and saw openings to attack Democrats over national security. There's no question that those Republicans are winning the argument. But they're winning the argument because they're not the only people who think big shows of American tolerance will fail to stop terrorists from recruiting. For Republicans who oppose the mosque, the task is simple, if not exactly straightforward: They don't want a debate about religious freedom in America. They want a debate over whether you trust the Obama administration. In that sense, they may be getting help from Obama's supporters, who may have promised too much about his appeal to the Islamic world. Before and after Obama took office, some foreign policy realists said that his election, all by itself, would smooth over relations between America and the ""Arab street."" Said former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in February 2009: ""I do think that with the election of President Obama, there are many changes that are out there and a different image of the United States."" In his first week in office, Obama announced a schedule for closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay. In June, he gave an address to Muslims in Cairo that was acclaimed by all the right people. But did this do anything for non-American Muslims or for Americans themselves? The 2009 Arab Opinion Poll, conducted by the Saban Center for Middle East Policy, showed Obama single-handedly spiking Muslim optimism about American foreign policy up to 51 percent. In the 2010 poll, it fell back to a Bush-level 16 percent. The Obama magic fell flat here, too: In February 2010, a poll for the Gallup Center for Muslim Studies found 53 percent of Americans viewing Islam unfavorably. The bad feelings weren't all Obama's fault. They were the result of reality crashing in, of foreign policy remaining a mess. But they're like the bitterness that Americans feel about the 2009 economic stimulus, which was oversold and has become politically toxic because its success is hard to measure. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that the promise of the Cordoba Initiative, the group involved in the planned mosque for Lower Manhattan, is easy for conservatives and Republicans to deride. When Americans are asked to look past their initial reactions and back the building of the mosque because it will send a good message, they're being asked to believe in a new kind of hope and change. And that's pretty much what the new crop of Republicans thinks about the mosque. A lot of their groundwork has been done by political and religious figures whose opinions of Islam--wicked, bent on conquest--were considered fringe in the Bush years and dismissed by his White House. Some of the GOP's strongest recruits are veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan who start their discussions of what the Muslim world really thinks with the credibility they earned in the field. They've pounced on this issue to make the case that Obama doesn't take radical Islam seriously enough as a threat. ""I don't think that this type of pandering improves our image with anyone,"" said Ilario Pantano, a congressional candidate in North Carolina who worked in the now-destroyed World Trade Center 4 before joining the Marine Corps. ""It suggests that we're exactly what the radical fringe believes we are, too soft and lethargic to actually defend ourselves. I'm not talking about all Muslims. I'm talking about radicals, and I think it's clear that this would be a victory for them. I mean, are we going to put up a martyr marker every time one of these terrorists blow themselves up?"" According to Pantano, the Bush administration's softer approach to Islam--the president's repeated insistence that Islam is a ""religion of peace""--made perfect sense. The problem, he said, was that it lulled Americans into a ""false sense of security"" and failed to inform them that the goal of radical Islam was not just terrorism, but the imposition of Sharia law. Retired Lt. Col. Allen West, who is making a well-funded run for Congress in Florida, seconded Pantano. ""When Bush made that statement, he was inaccurate,"" said West. ""It showed he had not yet done a good and proper study of the issue, and the next thing you knew his statement was being twisted. I think you've got to have a better understanding of the culture and mentality of radical Islam than that. Tolerance is fine. When tolerance is a one-way street, it leads to cultural suicide."" The sudden, news-cycle-devouring omnipresence of the ""ground zero mosque"" isn't necessarily bad news for Democrats. Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist argued that it had created, out of thin air, a way for embattled Democrats to distract voters from their economic record and create a new, flashy difference between them and President Obama. (It's exactly what Sen. Harry Reid tried on Monday.) But the mosque furor is devastating for the people who worry about how the Muslim world interprets the news coming out of the United States. It was hard enough before, Glassman says--the majority of world Muslims are willing to believe the worst about how Americans view their faith. When America responded to the 2004 tsunami in devastated parts of Indonesia, one popular conspiracy theory suggested that America was on a mission of conquest. ""The most powerful narrative that the United States has to fight, among Muslims, is this idea that we're out to destroy Islam and replace it with Christianity,"" Glassman says. ""When you view the world through a particular prism, it doesn't take much for an event to play into your narrative. Any incident will do."" Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

To attract top talent, you guarantee all cooks and waiters job security for life. Not only that, because you value honesty and candor, you allow them to say anything they want about you and your cuisine, publicly and without fear of retribution. The only catch is that all cooks or waiters would have to start out as dishwashers or busboys, for at least 10 years, when none of these protections would apply. It sounds absurd in the context of the food-service industry--for both you and your staff. But this system has governed academia for decades. Tenure--the ability to teach and conduct research without fear of being fired--is still the holy grail of higher education, to which all junior professors aspire. Yet fewer and fewer professors are attaining it. The proportion of full-time college professors with tenure has fallen from 57 percent in 1975 to 31 percent in 2007. The numbers for 2009, soon to be released by the Department of Education, are expected to dip even lower. To which some educators are saying: good riddance. Tenure is a bad deal not just for universities, which are saddled with its costs, but also for professors, who are constrained by its conventions. Cathy Trower, a researcher at Harvard University who has studied tenure for the last decade, says the current system may actually be scaring talented young people away from academia. ""This one-size-fits-all, rigid six-year up-and-out tenure system isn't working well,"" she says. The case against tenure has been around as long as tenure itself. (The American Association of University Professors first declared the principles of academic freedom and tenure in 1915 and then revised them in 1940.)But the argument becomes only stronger over time. As tuition climbs and universities struggle to pay their bills, tenure is starting to look unaffordable. Keeping a professor around indefinitely--tenure means they can't be forced to retire--simply costs a lot.  Mark C. Taylor, chair of the Columbia University department of religion and author of the forthcoming  Crisis on Campus: A Bold Plan for Reforming Our Colleges and Universities, calculates that someone who serves as an associate professor with tenure for five years and then becomes a full professor for 30 years costs a private university $12.2 million. * Public universities pay $10 million over the same period. And because most universities pay tenured professors out of their endowments, each professor freezes up tens of millions in otherwise-liquid endowment money for a generation. University debt jumped 54 percent last year, with an average debt of $168 million. If the average university tenured about 15 fewer professors, they'd be in the black. Then there's the effect of tenure on students. ""Publish or perish"" is the maxim of tenure-track professors. The corollary, of course, would be ""teach and perish."" Tenure committees claim to weigh publishing and teaching equally, but in practice publishing counts most. Taylor recalls a colleague winning a teaching award early in his career. Mentors urged him not to put it on his resume. When the best young teachers focus their energies on writing rather than teaching, students pay the price. The most common pro-tenure argument is that it protects academic freedom. Once a professor gains tenure, the thinking goes, he or she can say anything without fear of being fired. Academia thrives on the circulation of dangerous ideas. The problem is, for every tenured professor who's liberated at age 40 to speak his mind, there are dozens of junior professors terrified to say anything the least bit controversial, lest they lose their one shot at job security for life. Academia relies on young scholars to shake things up. Yet tenure incentivizes them not to. Instead, it rewards students who follow in the footsteps of the elders whose favor they will require when the day of judgment arrives. Besides, says Taylor, the idea that a tenured professor can finally ""speak out"" is absurd. ""If you don't have the guts to speak out before, you're not gonna have it after."" Even tenured professors still have all kinds of incentives to keep their heads down. There's still research to fund, administrators to placate, time off to negotiate. Just as tenure creates economic inflexibility, it also creates intellectual inflexibility. By hiring someone for life, a school gambles that his or her ideas are going to be just as relevant in 35 years. Tenure can also discourage interdisciplinary studies, since professors are rewarded for plumbing deep into an established subject area rather than connecting two different ones. Critics say that tenure hurts students by making professors lazy. Course loads vary widely from school to school: At some public universities, professors teach nine or 10 courses. At smaller schools, they teach as few as one or two, totaling as few as 140 classroom hours a year. If you can't be fired, what's to stop you from refusing to teach an extra course? ""I honestly don't know what a lot of academics do a lot of the time,"" says Taylor. But the clincher for the anti-tenure argument may come from the very people it is supposed to benefit: academics. Specifically, young academics. Consider the career path of an aspiring full-time tenured professor: Four years of college, six years getting a doctorate, four to six years as a post-doc, and then six years on the tenure track. By the time you come up for tenure, you're 40. For men, the timeline is inconvenient. But for women who want to have children, it's just about unworkable. That's one reason the number of full-time tenured professors has dropped so much in the past few decades: Women have joined the academic work force, but some have opted to take a part-time role. It's also why Princeton President Shirley Tilghman once called the tenure system ""no friend to women"" and suggested abolishing it entirely, although her views have softened since. Defenders say that tenure helps attract the best and brightest. Universities can't match the salary offered by a pharmaceutical company or an investment bank, the thinking goes, but they can offer job security. Yet the appeal of job security may be overrated. Tenure may be an added incentive, but it's almost never a deal maker. ""All sorts of brilliant people want to be members of academe,"" says Trower. ""I don't think it's because of tenure. It's because of the work."" The life of the mind is its own reward. So what's the alternative model? Renewable contracts. Some suggest seven years. Others say 10. The goal would be to give professors enough security to make them comfortable but not enough to breed complacency and lock the university into a deal that no longer makes sense. Don't abolish tenure altogether, says Trower. Just rework it. Create a tenure track that explicitly rewards teaching. Give interdisciplinary centers the authority to produce tenured professors. Allow for breaks in the tenure track if a professor needs to take time off. Offer the option of part-time tenure, a lower-cost alternative for professors who want to hold other jobs. In other words, make tenure flexible rather than a monolithic, in-or-out club. Some universities have already made the leap. Evergreen State College in Washington implemented renewable contracts back in 1971. Florida Gulf Coast University scrapped tenure when it was established in 1991. Boston University now offers salary premiums to professors who decide not to take tenure. Market forces will drive other universities to follow suit, whether they want to or not. But it wouldn't hurt to get a head start. Correction,  Aug. 12, 2010: This article incorrectly suggested that associate professors do not have tenure. In most cases, they do.
