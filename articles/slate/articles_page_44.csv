Jim Webb a white man's Democrat. It's him, in almost his own words. ""I think this is where Democrats screw up, you know?"" said Webb in an interview with Matt Bai of Yahoo News. ""I think that they have kind of unwittingly used this group, white working males, as a whipping post for a lot of their policies. And then when they react, they say they're being racist."" Webb thinks Democrats have focused too much on the interests of blacks, Latinos, and other groups to the exclusion of poor and working-class whites, who--like the others--face deep disadvantage and dwindling opportunities. ""Policy makers ignored such disparities within America's white cultures when, in advancing minority diversity programs, they treated whites as a fungible monolith,"" wrote Webb in a 2010 piece for the Wall Street Journal. ""Also lost on these policy makers were the differences in economic and educational attainment among nonwhite cultures. Thus nonwhite groups received special consideration in a wide variety of areas including business startups, academic admissions, job promotions, and lucrative government contracts."" This sounds like a blanket opposition to all anti-discrimination efforts, but Webb's view is more nuanced. Black Americans, he says, are a special case. ""The injustices endured by black Americans at the hands of their own government have no parallel in our history, not only during the period of slavery but also in the Jim Crow era that followed."" To Webb, they're owed remediation, and the United States has an ""obligation to assist those still in need."" Otherwise, he writes, ""government-directed diversity programs should end."" Instead, Webb argues, the Democratic Party should devote itself to a program of economic uplift that lends a helping hand to all Americans and that, specifically, can improve the fortunes of poor and working-class whites. There's a tinge of white identity politics to Webb's argument, which might make it off-putting to the liberals, including blacks, who are critical to winning a Democratic presidential primary. Which is to say that even if Webb is serious about running for president he doesn't have a chance. Still, that doesn't mean we shouldn't grapple with his message, which--even with the rough parts--contains a lot of insight. On the reality of white disadvantage, Webb is right. While the poverty rate for white Americans is 9.6 percent--substantially below the rate for Latinos (23.5 percent) and black Americans (27.2 percent)--they account for nearly half of all of America's poor, and 56 percent of the country's poverty-level wage earners are white. But this isn't part of the national conversation, which owes itself, in part, to geography. Unlike black and Latino poverty, which is tied heavily to the nation's urban spaces, white poverty is more diffuse, though there are areas where it's highly concentrated. Kentucky, West Virginia, and Arkansas are mostly white states with double-digit white poverty rates--18 percent, 16 percent, and 13 percent, respectively--and the ills that come with them: drug abuse, incarceration, and family dissolution. And overall, the number of whites who experience this kind of disadvantage has grown substantially in the last 20 years. ""The number of non-Hispanic white people residing in high-poverty neighborhoods more than doubled between 2000 and 2007-2011, rising from 1.4 million to 2.9 million,"" writes sociologist Paul Jargowsky in a 2014 report. Ironically, it's this pervasiveness--the fact of its existence in almost every part of America--that makes white poverty nearly invisible to the national elites, who cluster in urban centers like New York City and Washington D.C., where minorities are a presence. It's easy to forget the white poor when your closest examples of poverty are the housing projects of Anacostia and not the dilapidated mills of western North Carolina or the crumbling railroad towns of southern Georgia. Working-class whites face similar problems. While their disadvantage isn't as deep--although many will experience spells of poverty or even slip in the ranks of the long-term poor--they have landed with the short end of the economic stick. This isn't a new story.  Between deindustrialization and public disinvestment--as well as ""trickle-down"" policies that pushed productivity gains into profits, not wages--working-class incomes have been destroyed. A generation of whites has been left behind--with work that isn't steady if it pays well, and doesn't pay much if it's full time--and their children are sliding down the same path. What Webb recognizes is that from their perspective, neither the Democratic Party nor the government is on their side. Ignore whether you agree with Webb's normative suggestions--that Democrats should give up anti-discrimination and affirmative action programs. The simple truth is that working-class whites see the Democratic Party as hostile to their interests as workers and citizens. The former, according to Andrew Levison's The White Working Class Today: Who They Are, How They Think, and How Progressives Can Regain Their Support, has a lot to do with immigration. Many working-class whites are hostile to immigration, and see immigrants as a threat to their livelihood, who take ""jobs, housing, and health care"" from native-born citizens. Levinson quotes a 2004 focus group on working class whites and immigration. ""The groups are getting very large and it seems when they come over here they are getting all the tax breaks,"" says one woman. ""They get all this help. They get this, they get that...and those of us who have fought for this country, who have paid our taxes, who raise our children and who live in this country and in this state are the ones that are paying for all those people to get all those breaks and our children and our lifestyles are not increasing, they are staying stagnant."" It shouldn't shock anyone that they're rankled when they see a party unreservedly support policies that either encourage immigration, or protect illegal entrants to the country. And it doesn't help either that this is the same party whose president--Bill Clinton--pioneered free-trade agreements that they believe hurt their well-being. As for their interests as citizens, while working-class whites aren't opposed to anti-poverty programs--in a Pew study, 43 percent said that government benefits don't go far enough to improve life for the poor, and large majorities oppose cuts to Social Security and Medicare--they are hostile to government as an institution. They believe it's inefficient, corrupt, and governed by elites who channel benefits--like welfare and affirmative action--to the so-called undeserving. That isn't hard to understand. Working-class whites--like most Americans--believe deeply in the moral value of work, and value the ability to build stable lives and families. But since the 1970s, their work hasn't paid off. They've either lost their incomes or they've lost their jobs, and for men especially, there are few other opportunities. And while the government says it helps, they don't see it. Instead, they see programs and benefits for people who don't work, either in their communities--the old classmate taking disability even if he could get a job--or outside of them, like the poor blacks collecting food stamps, or the Hispanic immigrants getting in-state tuition for their kids. Yes, these perceptions are skewed and often have more to do with prejudice than facts (blacks, for instance, don't differ all that much in their attitudes toward work and welfare). But they're real, and they matter. For millions of working-class whites, the Democratic Party is helping others at their expense, and they're responding accordingly. Now, the question isn't whether Democrats can reverse this. There's a decent case to make that if the party follows Webb--if it renounces its commitment to diversity and anti-discrimination programs, if it abandons immigration reform, and makes showy denunciations of the ""undeserving"" poor--then it can win some of these voters, especially if paired with an economic populism that gives direct benefits to these communities. In fact, this was essentially the Democratic strategy for the first half of the 20th century, and it helped build one of the most powerful political coalitions in the nation's history. The question is whether this is the right thing to do. Should Democrats run away from their minority constituencies--or at least take them for granted--for the sake of winning some portion of the white working class? There's no doubt that for a certain kind of Democrat, it is tempting. But consider this: It may be too late. With the rise of Barack Obama, Democrats may be too tied to their minority identity to walk back. Indeed, it's worth noting that even Webb had a hard time winning working-class whites. As Nia-Malika Henderson notes for the Washington Post, Webb lost working-class white men by 24 points in his 2006 Senate race--the same margin as Obama in 2008. Beyond the practical obstacles, there's also this: To follow Webb's strategy is to give up the drive to make the United States a more just and more fair multiracial democracy. For all of its flaws and betrayals, the present Democratic agenda is at least a nudge in that direction, an attempt to build common cause and shared responsibility across racial and ethnic lines. And while it comes with painful political trade-offs--supporting policies like immigration and affirmative action means alienating a large part of the country--it's the right thing to do. Still, while Webb is wrong about the party's approach to racial minorities, he's right about its approach to economic policy. Given their social priorities, a certain weakness with working-class whites is baked into the cake. But there's room to do much better. And step one is a robust economic agenda that goes beyond poverty reduction and devotes itself to raising incomes. Working Americans have yet to reap the gains of a growing economy, and if they want to win Congress again--to say nothing of the White House--Democrats need to show that they can fix the problem."	Jim Webb Wants to Be a White Man's Democrat. The Party Should Listen to What He Has to Say.
1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/some_house_conservatives_want_to_oust_john_boehner_why_louie_gohmert_is.html	"Louie Gohmert is a busy man. Since Sunday morning, when the Texas congressman went on Fox and Friends Weekend and told Tucker Carlson that he was gunning to be speaker of the House, he's been on a whistle-stop media tour. And while the Texan with a gleaming pate and a thick drawl might not yet be a household name, he has a cadre of loyal and devoted fans among the conservative grassroots. In this case, that means precious little; the CPAC Straw Poll doesn't pick the next leader of the House of Representatives. Nonetheless, Gohmert and his boosters are working overtime for House Speaker John Boehner's ouster. And they stand to benefit from those efforts--even if (when) things don't play out according to their plans. ""I had said now for a long time that I think we need a new leader, somebody with a bold, dynamic vision,"" said Sean Hannity on his radio show Monday afternoon, talking with Gohmert about Speaker Boehner's tenure. ""I don't see him as the guy."" Gohmert, never coy, seemed happy to vent. ""It's like a dictatorship,"" he said. ""Nobody becomes a chairman, gets a committee, if he doesn't want it."" Gohmert isn't the first to try to topple Boehner. A small cadre of conservative House members snagged headlines two years ago when they made noise about pushing the House speaker out of his job. Of course, they failed miserably. Only 12 Republicans voted against Boehner, and the effort was an embarrassment to many of those involved. This time, though, Boehner's foes hope it will be different. On the one hand, they have a steeper climb; in 2013, only 17 Republicans needed to defect to keep the speaker from immediately getting re-elected. But because Republicans grew their House majority in the 2014 midterm elections, it will now take at least 29 Republican defections to block Boehner's re-election. On the other hand, conservative activists say that this time they have come prepared; they've been planning to challenge Boehner since long before the November elections. Drew Ryun, the political director for the conservative Madison Project, said his group had a fairly simple vetting process for deciding which midterm candidates to endorse: ""There was really only one reason we endorsed in a lot of races, and that was how people answered on whether they would vote for or against John Boehner,"" he said. ""So this was something that, frankly, we've been working on for well over a year."" Things started hopping a few weeks ago, according to conservative Iowa radio host Steve Deace. He said the CRomnibus deal to fund the federal government was the last straw for many conservatives. ""This was not done fly by night,"" he said. ""This has been game-planned out, really, almost from the day after the CRomnibus vote."" Deace learned about activists' efforts three weeks ago. At the time, he thought they had a 10-percent chance of succeeding. Now, he gives them a 30-percent shot. Anger over the CRomnibus deal--which passed the House thanks to help from congressional Democrats and last-minute lobbying from the president--was a significant factor for many on the right, but they say momentum has built since then. Deace said the House leadership's defense of Rep. Steve Scalise also disgusted some conservatives. Scalise, the new House majority whip, confessed last week to addressing a white supremacist conference in 2002. Tea Partiers argued that one of their own would never have received the protection that Scalise got from Boehner. The perceived double standard ""reinforced everybody's disgust,"" Deace said. ""I think the Steve Scalise situation was manna from heaven,"" he continued. ""I think that was a political gift. When you're on the right side and you have momentum, you just get breaks like that."" That said, Gohmert and his allies aren't without critics. Rep. Morgan Griffith, a Virginia Republican, released a statement on Monday saying he would have taken their efforts seriously if someone had challenged Boehner at the Republicans' Nov. 13th conference meeting where the speaker was renominated without contest. ""In order to be a leader of the U.S. House of Representatives or, for that matter, any legislative body, one must have a plan for leadership,"" he said. ""While I do not completely agree with John Boehner's leadership style or plan, at least he has one."" It's unlikely that Boehner is going anywhere. The Washington Post has been keeping a whip count for the speaker vote, and it doesn't look great for Team Gohmert. By that count, there are currently 14 Republicans who are very likely to vote against Boehner. That number needs to double by Tuesday if conservatives have any shot at ousting him. Realistically, it's not going to happen. But Boehner's adversaries will still see an upside; the vote gives them a chance to fire up activists and grow their email lists. Deace adds that it also will give members a chance to show their true colors. And what's the worst that could happen? ""He's already the best speaker the Democrats have already had,"" said Deace. ""To me, there's nothing to really lose here."" Plus, as Gohmert told Hannity, it might make for good TV. ""I betcha this is going to be the most-watched voting for speaker in the history of C-SPAN,"" Gohmert said."	Why Some House Republicans Want to Oust John Boehner
2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/selma_and_lbj_why_critics_are_wrong_about_how_the_film_portrays_president.html	"Ava DuVernay's Selma is likely a top contender for the Academy Award for Best Picture. With its focus on the power of activism to force political and moral change, the highly praised film has the right message for our present moment of racial unrest. But not everyone is happy with the way it approaches history, and in particular, how it portrays President Lyndon Johnson. Johnson ""is devoid of any palpable conviction on voting rights. Vainglorious and power hungry, he unleashes his zealous pit bull, FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover, on King, who is determined to march in protest from Selma to Montgomery despite LBJ's warning that it will be 'open season' on the protesters,"" writes Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum director Mark K. Updegrove in a column for Politico magazine. ""This characterization,"" he continues, ""flies in the face of history."" Even harsher is former Johnson staffer Joseph A. Califano Jr., who accuses DuVernay of taking ""trumped-up license with a true story that didn't need any embellishment to work as a big-screen historical drama."" ""In fact,"" writes Califano, ""Selma was LBJ's idea."" That's a huge exaggeration. Activists had been organizing in Selma, Alabama, for at least two years before Martin Luther King Jr. met with Johnson, and weeks prior to his meeting with the president, King and his allies had decided on Selma as the site for new action and protests. By the time Johnson suggested something similar to King, the plan was already in motion. But more than that, that entire line of criticism is misplaced. Selma isn't a documentary or even a dramatized history. It is a film based on historical accounts, and like all films of its genre, it has a loose relationship to actual history. In Alan Parker's Mississippi Burning, the investigation to solve the murders of three civil rights workers in 1964, is transformed into a story of FBI heroes, one that ignores the role of local activists in bringing the killers to justice and doesn't touch the bureau's famous antagonism--under J. Edgar Hoover--toward the civil rights movement. Just as egregious is the narrative of Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty, which shows a relentless Central Intelligence Agency--personified in Jessica Chastain as Maya--whose methods, including torture, lead to Osama Bin Laden and the military raid that killed him. The factual problem, as detailed in December's Senate Intelligence Committee report, is that torture didn't lead to unique intelligence. As such, it's not clear that it helped find Bin Laden. But Bigelow made a choice to say otherwise, and in the context of the film, it's defensible. Zero Dark Thirty--to my eyes at least--is less about the particulars of finding Bin Laden and more about the costs of obsession. What happens when you're willing to give up everything for a single goal? What will you sacrifice? In this reading, torture is the moment when we--through Maya--commit to darkness in pursuit of our ends. This is all to say that it's wrong to treat nonfiction films--even biopics--as documentaries. Instead, it's better to look at deviations from established history or known facts as creative choices--license in pursuit of art. As viewers, we should be less concerned with fact-checking and more interested in understanding the choices. Why did the director opt for this view and not a different one? If she omits and distorts, why? What is she trying to communicate? It's with these questions in mind that we should approach Selma. But first, we should look at how DuVernay actually presents Johnson (played by Tom Wilkinson) and his relationship with King (played by David Oyelowo). At worst, DuVernay depicts Johnson and King as wary allies. In the film, Johnson agrees with King on the need for a Voting Rights Act, but he wants him to wait--Johnson has a Great Society to build--and warns that he doesn't have the votes to push another civil rights bill on the heels of the 1964 Act, which outlawed discrimination in public accommodations. It's not that King and Johnson are enemies--they both want to dismantle Jim Crow--as much as they have different responsibilities and priorities. In order to act, Johnson needs a push. And King gives it to him. Now, there's a case that even this is unfair to Johnson. While it's true he didn't want to introduce a voting rights bill so soon after the Civil Rights Act of 1964--he needed votes for his economic program, and he didn't want to alienate Southern Democrats--it's also true that, in late 1964, Johnson told Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach to write the ""the goddamndest, toughest voting rights act you can devise."" This draft was written with help from Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield and Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen, and was the basis for the bill the leaders introduced in March 1965. The Johnson of Selma, in other words, is much more reluctant than the Johnson of reality. This is most clear in the scenes with Hoover (played by Dylan Baker), where Johnson allows the FBI director to harass King's family with evidence of his infidelity. This is a far cry from real life. Yes, Johnson knew the contents of the FBI's file on King, but there's no evidence he conspired to smear him. That was a Hoover project, with no connection to Selma or the Voting Rights Act. Johnson may have been frustrated, but he wasn't stupid, and attacking King would have only radicalized the movement, pushing it closer to its more militant activists. As much as King needed Johnson, Johnson needed King. Which brings us back to our original question, arguably the only one you should ask of a movie that fictionalizes historical events: Why did the director make these choices? What is DuVernay trying to tell us when she makes Johnson more reluctant than he was, or when she shifts the timeline to give him a role in the FBI's smear tapes? It's possible these choices reflect ignorance, but I don't think that's right--Selma gets so much right about the period that it's hard to believe DuVernay just didn't know. It's also possible they reflect malice, but again, Johnson isn't the villain of the film--that distinction goes to Tim Roth's (delightful) George Wallace, who doesn't care that he's on the ""wrong side of history."" If you need a clue, look at the people portrayed in the movie. If you don't count Martin Sheen, who plays federal Judge Frank Minis Johnson Jr., Johnson and Wallace are the only politicians. Almost everyone else is an activist or an ordinary citizen: Carmen Ejogo's Coretta Scott King, Lorraine Toussaint's Amelia Boynton, Wendell Pierce's Hosea Williams, Keith Stanfield's Jimmie Lee Jackson, Stephan James' John Lewis, Jeremy Strong's James Reeb, Andre Holland's Andrew Young, and many, many others. Selma, simply put, is about the men and women who fought to put voting rights on the national agenda, and it engages history from their perspective. By hardening Johnson--and making him a larger roadblock than he was--DuVernay emphasizes the grass roots of the movement and the particular struggles of King and his allies. In the long argument of who matters most--activists or politicians--DuVernay falls on the side of the former, showing how citizens can expand the realm of the possible and give politicians the push--and the room--they need to act. By those terms, Selma mostly succeeds. But there are flaws. ""Except for a few scenes, we see little of the bravery Selma's citizens displayed,"" writes historian Gary May for the Daily Beast. ""Annie Lee Cooper, well played by [Oprah] Winfrey, is shown trying but failing to register to vote. We are not told that Cooper had been able to vote without hindrance when she lived in Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. But when she returned to Selma in 1962 to care for her aged mother, she lost that right."" If Selma could have been better, it wasn't because DuVernay didn't do justice to Lyndon Johnson, but because there was so much to show about the ordinary people of Selma, and we--as viewers--don't see it."	Critics Say Selma Isn't Fair to LBJ. They're Completely Missing the Point.

Steve Scalise may have just ineptly admitted to speaking at a white supremacist event that eyewitnesses say he never attended. Two event attendees say it's factually inaccurate to characterize Scalise's comments as directed at the supremacist gathering--even though Scalise's own office has said the House majority whip spoke to the group 12 years ago. Kenny Knight is a longtime associate of David Duke, the former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan who ran for governor of Louisiana in 1991. He's been a key player in news that broke on Sunday that indicated Scalise addressed the white supremacist convention of the European-American Unity and Rights Organization when he was a Louisiana state representative in May 2002. Knight said on Tuesday that it's ""totally incorrect"" to say Scalise spoke at that convention. ""He spoke early in the day to a contingent of people, prior to the conference kicking off,"" Knight said. ""He was not there as a guest speaker at the conference."" According to Knight, he and Scalise were neighbors in 2002, living in the Old Jefferson neighborhood outside New Orleans. They were friendly and lived within a few blocks of each other. Knight recalls that Scalise would beep the horn and wave at him if he drove by in his car. ""Now and then I'd see him at a Republican function, we'd say hello, but we never exchanged any philosophy ideas,"" Knight said. Knight has known and publicly supported Duke for decades. He agreed to help Duke set up some of the logistics for the 2002 EURO convention, especially since the former KKK leader was in Russia at the time of the event. You can read more about EURO's background here at the Southern Poverty Law Center. It's ugly stuff--anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, concerns about ""the 'browning' of America,"" Nazi apologia--but Knight insists the organization isn't a white supremacist group. Regardless, Knight said that he wasn't involved in planning the event's itinerary or picking its speakers but that he did book space for it in the Landmark Best Western Hotel in Metairie, Louisiana. Besides booking the venue, Knight said he also set up refreshments for attendees, arranged for them to eat at a local restaurant, and organized a haunted house tour of the French Quarter after the conference. ""I, simply as a courtesy to Mr. Duke, rented the room and set it up to give them a location,"" he said. ""I wasn't really involved with the actual conference itself."" It's important to bear in mind that Knight isn't critical of the conference, which puts him in a very small category. ""EURO was not a white supremacist organization,"" he said. ""The people that came were middle-aged, taxpaying, God-fearing, Christian people."" According to Knight, the EURO conference was slated to start in the early afternoon, roughly around 1 p.m. But his reservation at the hotel gave him access to the conference space for a few hours before the event's official kickoff. At the time, Knight headed the Jefferson Heights Civic Association, which was largely comprised of elderly people who lived in his and Scalise's neighborhood. Knight said he set up a morning event for his own civic association in the hotel space before the EURO conference started. Though that event was in the conference's hospitality room, it wasn't at all related to the EURO event, he said. ""It was my room to do what I want with it,"" he said. Knight invited then-state Rep. Scalise as well as a representative from the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office and a person from the American Red Cross to speak to the civic association at the hotel. Knight said he thinks the Red Cross speaker was from a local chapter but didn't remember specifically. He also said he didn't remember the names of either of the other speakers. The representative from the sheriff's department spoke to attendees about a neighborhood watch program, and the person from the Red Cross discussed CPR techniques. Scalise also spoke. ""I wanted to reach out to him and give him an audience so he could talk to people from his district about legislation he was proposing,"" Knight said. ""I did that as a courtesy."" Knight estimates that about two-thirds to three-quarters of the people in the hospitality room at the civic association meeting were local residents who weren't there to attend the EURO event, and about one-third to one-quarter were EURO convention attendees who arrived early and filtered into the hospitality room to drink coffee and kill time. ""I don't think Steve was aware that there was a small contingent of people who came and sat in the audience prior to the EURO meeting,"" Knight said. I asked Knight if there was a sign on the hospitality room indicating it had been reserved for the EURO conference. ""I think not,"" Knight said. ""I really truly believe, if there were any signs or banners up, Mr. Scalise would [have asked], 'What is that?' And he probably would have left. Because I don't recall having any banners or signs up at all."" Knight said that when he invited Scalise to speak to the civic association, he never mentioned that it would be held in the same room the EURO conference would later use or that some conference attendees may be present. Barbara Noble, Knight's then-girlfriend who was also present at the hotel event and who I spoke with separately, corroborated Knight's account. ""[Scalise] was just up there for a few minutes, maybe 10, 15 at the most, and it was in the morning,"" she said. Noble said that there was no signage, banners, or mention of the EURO conference at the civic association event and that Scalise left immediately after giving his talk. The first report of Scalise's alleged comments to the white supremacist organization came on Sunday from Louisiana blogger Lamar White, who uncovered anonymous posts on Stormfront, a longstanding neo-Nazi online forum. Besides Knight and Noble, the only event attendees who have spoken publicly about the meeting are Scalise himself--who told the Times-Picayune that he doesn't remember it--and a white nationalist StormFront message board commenter who wrote under the username ""Alsace Hebert"" and whose account now appears to be defunct. However, on Monday, an adviser for the House majority whip told the Washington Post that Scalise ""appeared at a convention of the European-American Unity and Rights Organization, or EURO."" Knight and Noble are adamant that the Jefferson Heights Civic Association event and the EURO convention were clearly distinct events. When asked if he had invited Scalise to attend the EURO conference, Knight replied, ""That is not what happened. I'll take a lie-detector test. That is not what happened."" When asked Tuesday afternoon, a spokeswoman for Scalise didn't comment on Knight and Noble's version of the events. There's total consensus on the right and left that Scalise displayed miserable judgment by associating himself with Knight, an ally of the former KKK leader. But Knight's and Noble's accounts cast doubt on an emerging narrative: that, as Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman Josh Schwerin told Politico, the Louisiana Republican ""chose to cheerlead for a group of KKK members and neo-Nazis at a white supremacist rally."" If Knight and Noble are right, then the truth is much less theatrical than some make it sound."	Did Rep. Steve Scalise Admit to Speaking at a White Supremacist Event He Never Attended?
4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/obama_economy_what_should_republicans_say_now_that_the_gdp_is_growing_the.html	"Having come of age in the late 1990s, when the American economy was the envy of the world, the past half-decade has been a dispiriting slog. So, while I've learned to temper my enthusiasm about even the best economic news, I'll admit that even I'm getting a little pepped up. While the Great Recession has technically been over since the summer of 2009, a weak labor market and stagnant wages for all but a few have meant that most Americans have barely noticed. Now, however, there are signs that we're in for a year or two of robust growth. The Commerce Department has just released revised estimates of U.S. gross domestic product from the second and third quarters of 2014, and it turns out that growth has been much stronger than we had originally assumed. Going forward, plummeting oil prices will benefit almost all Americans, with the possible exception of those who've poured a lot of effort and time into accessing shale oil deposits here at home. John H. Makin of the American Enterprise Institute estimates that if the fall in oil prices sticks--it's down from an average of $110 a barrel to about $70 a barrel--the economic impact will be much like that of a $160 billion tax cut. Exports are also rising, despite the fact that the U.S. dollar remains strong. All in all, it's looking like a fairly merry Christmas, at least by the dismal standards of recent years. And if we're lucky, next year might be better still. So now, with my fingers crossed in the hope that I won't jinx anything, I've started to wonder what a stronger economy might mean for American politics. Throughout the Obama years, Republicans have failed to offer a compelling economic agenda, choosing instead to point to the fact that the economy was not so hot, that unemployment levels were high, and that the federal deficit was eye-poppingly huge. It's easy to see why the GOP decided to go this route. Americans, like the citizens of most market democracies, believe elected officials have magical powers when it comes to things like GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation. When things go wrong, the president gets the blame. When things go right, he gets the credit. This is despite the fact that the American economy is a complex beast that even our most sophisticated technocrats scarcely understand and the fact that Saudi sheikhs who decide to let the oil flow can have about as big an impact on how much U.S. households spend on Chinese-made tchotchkes this holiday season as a Congress that decides to slash payroll taxes. I'm exaggerating but only slightly. In 2010 and 2014, reminding voters that ""we are not currently in charge and things are bad"" basically worked for Republicans, particularly with older white voters favorably disposed toward conservative candidates. In the next two years, this strategy is unlikely to work quite so well. It will get harder to deny that the economy is picking up a head of steam, that unemployment levels have gone from high to halfway decent, and that the federal budget deficit is getting smaller. Should Republicans congratulate President Obama on a job well done and leave it at that? Well, no. They need to do what they've failed to do for the past half-decade and explain why they can do a better job than the Democrats of steering the American economy. But getting to this point will be very difficult. To state the obvious, the fact that the United States experienced the worst financial crisis in the living memory of all but a handful of nonagenarians while George W. Bush was in the White House has been hard for Republicans to overcome. One of Mitt Romney's greatest failures in his 2012 campaign was his almost shocking inability to explain how he'd govern differently from Bush and why Republican economic policies wouldn't lead to disaster. Romney, like most Republicans in the Obama era, fixated on shrinking the budget deficit. While he talked a big game about reviving economic growth, he did an awful job of explaining why growth was so sluggish and what he intended to do about it in the near term, tax cuts and deregulation aside. What might Republicans have done differently? According to Texas State University economist David Beckworth and National Review's Ramesh Ponnuru, the chief problem with the Republican worldview in the post-crisis years is that it has coupled calls for rapidly shrinking the federal deficit with fervent opposition to monetary stimulus, which the GOP has warned will lead to an inflationary spiral. Instead, Beckworth and Ponnuru insist that the Federal Reserve ought to have done more. They argue that the Fed ought to have announced that it would buy assets until nominal spending, or NGDP, reached a target level and that it intended to keep nominal spending growth on a predictable path. Had the Fed charted such a course, Beckworth and Ponnuru believe, the goal of fiscal consolidation would have been much easier to achieve, as higher nominal incomes would have kept more workers employed and more homeowners afloat, thus reducing the pressure to increase transfers. Many argue that NGDP targeting of the kind championed by Beckworth and Ponnuru is much easier said than done and that it is no panacea. That might be true. What is also true is that successful fiscal retrenchment efforts in countries like Canada and Sweden were accompanied by the same kind of accommodative monetary policy that American conservatives tend to oppose. Republican economic prescriptions have often seemed timeless in the Obama era, in a bad way. By emphasizing tax cuts, deregulation, and balanced budgets--the same policies they favored in better times--the GOP ignored the particularities that made deficit spending a less pressing problem than mass unemployment, and they allowed chimerical fears of hyperinflation to outweigh the very real threat of deflation. Embracing monetary stimulus would have given the right a coherent way to favor fiscal consolidation while also acknowledging that the weakness of the post-crisis economy demanded a response. Calling for monetary expansion and, say, a much deeper temporary payroll tax cut, like the one proposed by Stanford University economist Michael Boskin, would have put the GOP in a much better position both substantively and politically. Instead, Republicans struggled to connect with the voters most directly affected by the dismal state of the labor market. What should Republicans do now? They could do worse than to build on the work of Utah Sen. Mike Lee, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, all of whom have been thinking hard about the barriers to upward mobility in modern America. Good economic news today won't change the fact that one in six American adults lacks the basic skills of literacy and numeracy, or that high-quality educational opportunities are beyond the reach of most American kids raised in low- and middle-income families. Nor will it change the fact that while Obamacare has expanded access to subsidized medical care, our health system remains a dysfunctional mess that limits our economic potential. Even though the worst of the housing bust is behind us, rigid regulations have made some of our most productive cities unaffordable, which in turn has driven millions of Americans to regions with cheap homes but also low wages. There are no silver bullets for addressing these problems, but if Republicans don't devote more of their energies to tackling them, they'll have no chance of winning the elections to come--and they won't deserve to win them either."

Hours later, in Brooklyn, New York, he ambushed and killed two police officers in their car and then killed himself. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio described the murders as ""execution-style."" Police don't have a motive for the shootings, but Brinsley had a long criminal record--he was arrested for robbery charges in Ohio in 2009 and served two years in prison for felony gun possession in Georgia--and had made anti-police messages on Instagram the day of the shooting. These deaths come at a terrible time for New York City. Between the killing of Eric Garner in Staten Island and the shooting of Akai Gurley in Brooklyn, many residents are wary of the police. And their protests against police brutality have fueled a counter-movement from cops and their supporters, who see criticism as hostile and ""anti-police,"" and who have scorned officials who sympathize with the protesters. ""Police officers feel like they are being thrown under the bus,"" said Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, after de Blasio spoke about Garner in the context of his son, who is black. ""Is my child safe, and not just from some of the painful realities of crime and violence in some of our neighborhoods,"" said de Blasio, ""but safe from the very people they want to have faith in as their protectors? That's the reality."" All of this was in the air during the New York City mayor's Saturday evening press conference with Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, where he tried to ease tensions, despite a dramatic action from police at the event, who turned their backs when de Blasio spoke. The mayor called the killings a ""particularly despicable act"" that ""tears at the very foundation of our society."" He called it an ""attack on all of us."" ""Our city is in mourning, our hearts are heavy,"" he said. ""We lost two good men who devoted their lives to protecting all of us."" But for several politicians and police organizations, this call of solidarity wasn't enough. ""Our society stands safer because of the sacrifices officers make every day, but the hatred that has grown over the past few weeks in this country has gone unchecked by many elected leaders,"" said the head of the New Jersey Policemen's Benevolent Association in a statement on Facebook. ""The blood of 2 executed police officers is on the hands of Mayor de Blasio,"" tweeted the New York Sergeants Benevolent Association. Likewise, on Twitter, former New York Gov. George Pataki said he was ""sickened by these barbaric acts, which sadly are a predictable outcome of divisive anti-cop rhetoric of #ericholder & #mayordeblasio."" Lynch was even more inflammatory. ""There is blood on many hands, from those that incited violence under the guise of protest to try to tear down what police officers do every day,"" he said, addressing police outside the hospital where the slain officers were taken. ""That blood on the hands starts on the steps of city hall in the office of the mayor."" In Baltimore, one lodge president in the Fraternal Order of Police gave a more expansive statement, blaming national officials for the violence. ""Politicians and community leaders from President Obama, to Attorney General Holder, New York Mayor de Blasio, and Al Sharpton have, as the result of their lack of proper guidance, created the atmosphere of unnecessary hostility and peril that police officers now find added to the ordinary danger of their profession."" And all of these sentiments were echoed by former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani. ""We've had four months of propaganda starting with the president that everybody should hate the police,"" said Giuliani during an appearance on Fox News on Sunday. ""The protests are being embraced, the protests are being encouraged. The protests, even the ones that don't lead to violence, a lot of them lead to violence, all of them lead to a conclusion. The police are bad, the police are racist. That is completely wrong."" But these complaints aren't true. Police officers aren't under siege from hostile elected officials. At no point, for example, has de Blasio attacked the New York City Police Department. Instead, he's called for improved policing, including better community relations and new training for ""de-escalation"" techniques. ""Fundamental questions are being asked, and rightfully so,"" he said at the beginning of the month, after the grand jury decision in the death of Eric Garner. ""The way we go about policing has to change."" Likewise, neither President Obama nor Attorney General Eric Holder has substantively criticized police. After a Ferguson, Missouri, grand jury declined to indict Officer Darren Wilson in the killing of Michael Brown, Obama appealed for calm and praised law enforcement for doing a ""tough job."" ""Understand,"" he said, ""our police officers put their lives on the line for us every single day. They've got a tough job to do to maintain public safety and hold accountable those who break the law."" When directly asked if ""African-American and Latino young people should fear the police,"" Holder said no. ""I don't think that they should fear the police,"" he said in an interview for New York magazine with MSNBC's Joy-Ann Reid. ""But I certainly think that we have to build up a better relationship between young people, people of color, and people in law enforcement."" Even Al Sharpton supports cops. ""We are not anti-police,"" he said after the Wilson grand jury concluded. ""If our children are wrong, arrest them. Don't empty your gun and act like you had no other way."" And on this Sunday morning, Sharpton held an event where he and the Garner family condemned the cop killings in Brooklyn. ""I'm standing here in sorrow over losing those two police officers,"" said Garner's mother. ""Two police officers lost their lives senselessly."" The family of Michael Brown has condemned the shootings--""[We reject] any kind of violence directed toward members of law enforcement""--and in a statement, the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge, said, ""This is not about race or affiliation, and it isn't about black versus blue. All lives matter."" Nothing here should be a surprise. Despite what these police organizations and their allies allege, there isn't an anti-police movement in this country, or at least, none of any significance. The people demonstrating for Eric Garner and Michael Brown aren't against police, they are for better policing. They want departments to treat their communities with respect, and they want accountability for officers who kill their neighbors without justification. When criminals kill law-abiding citizens, they're punished. When criminals kill cops, they're punished. But when cops kill citizens, the system breaks down and no one is held accountable. That is what people are protesting. Given the dangers inherent to being a police officer--and the extent to which most cops are trying to do the best they can--it's actually understandable that cops are a little angry with official and unofficial criticism. But they should know it comes with the territory. For all the leeway they receive, the police aren't an inviolable force; they're part of a public trust, accountable to elected leaders and the people who choose them. And in the same way that police have a responsibility to protect and secure the law, citizens have a responsibility to hold improper conduct to account. Yes, this is contested terrain and both sides will fight to define the scope and limits of police power. But these arguments are a vital part of self-governance, which is why everyone should be disturbed by statements like Giuliani's, Pataki's, and Patrick Lynch's. The idea that citizens can't criticize police--that free speech excludes scrutiny of state violence--is disturbing. Since, if free speech doesn't include the right to challenge the official use of force, then it isn't really free speech."	No One Is Stoking an Anti-Police Movement. We Just Want Better Policing.

With gas prices falling by more than $1 per gallon since this summer, consumers have responded by opting for big SUVs and light trucks instead of smaller and more fuel-efficient cars. In November, sales of the larger vehicles climbed by nearly 9 percent compared with the same month last year, while sales of the smaller ones dipped by a tenth of a percent. As the newly immortal Stephen Colbert would say, ""carpe gasum."" It's an oversimplification to attribute the trend entirely to cheap gas--low interest rates, holiday promotions, and other incentives have all played a role--but it's clear that fuel economy takes a backseat when consumers are paying less at the pump. That reality is a significant blow to U.S. efforts to slow man-made climate change. More than half of an average American household's carbon emissions come from its vehicles, with each extra gallon of gasoline that's burned creating another 20 pounds of greenhouse gases. If gas prices stay where they are or fall further still, it will also make life more difficult for automakers, which are scrambling to meet the aggressive new fuel economy standards that President Obama enacted in his first term. But while we're lamenting the fickleness of the American consumer, let's step back and acknowledge something important: Obama's auto rules are working exactly as they should. The new rules require automakers to increase the average fuel economy of their entire fleets. With Americans putting less of a premium on fuel economy, that means companies will need to find ways to offset increased sales of less fuel-efficient trucks by selling more fuel-efficient cars. While that won't be easy if Americans continue their love affair with the SUV, the good news for the climate--and the consumer--is that those gas-guzzling vehicles are becoming more fuel-efficient too. Thanks to the federal rules, increased fuel efficiency effectively now comes standard with each new car, truck, and SUV that rolls off the lot. That will dampen the damage cheap oil is wreaking on the climate. It also just might save the day for the auto industry when the always unpredictable price of oil inevitably does an about-face, forcing shoppers to do the same. According to the Transportation Research Institute, the average fuel economy of newly purchased cars and trucks hit an all-time record of 25.8 miles per gallon in August. The following month that number dipped to 25.3 mpg, where it has held relatively steady as the price of gas has tumbled. In a perfect world, the average fuel economy would continue to climb independent of gas prices. But it's clear that we'd be in much worse shape without Obama's auto rules. Even when you factor in the recent drop, the average fuel economy of new cars is still 14 percent higher than it was five years ago. In the two decades that preceded the president's new rules, meanwhile, fuel economy remained largely flat. It's clear the industry wasn't going to act on its own. Automakers need to be forced to offer more fuel-efficient cars and trucks because manufacturers and dealers turn much larger profits by selling a hulking Chevy Tahoe SUV ($66,475; 18 mpg) than a diminutive Chevy Cruze ($22,150; 30 mpg). That's why some in the industry are already grumbling about the new rules, which will continue to ratchet up fleetwide fuel economy to 54.5 mpg by 2025. ""The regulatory structure wants to force people into vehicles that consumers don't rationally want to buy,"" Steven Szakaly, the chief economist at the National Automobile Dealer Association, lamented to Bloomberg Businessweek earlier this month. ""That's a problem."" Despite such complaints, automakers are finding ways to meet both consumer preference and federal demands. Consider the Ford F-150, which has been America's best-selling vehicle for the past three decades. Its latest incarnation will get an estimated 26 mpg on the highway, up 3 mpg from model year 2014 and 6 mpg above what the F-150 got in model year 2009. (Those gains are even bigger than they appear if we were to translate them into gallons consumed per mile, a more telling metric.) On a micro level, the credit for that belongs to the designers who opted for aluminum rather than steel for the body of the truck, dropping its weight by about 700 pounds. But on the macro level, it's clear that the new federal rules are responsible for this remarkable shift. Without the federal government forcing automakers' hands, there's no reason to believe that Detroit or the rest of the industry would have avoided the same mistakes it made in the 1970s and 1980s. Back then, wild swings in the price of oil and gas left automakers with whiplash as they tried to keep up with shifting consumer demand. Automakers, which think in years, aren't agile enough to keep pace with consumers, who change their minds based on today's gas prices. Left to their own devices, the financial incentives--and the corresponding pressure from profit-seeking stockholders--demand that the industry errs on the side of short-term profits over long-term sustainability. We have to look no further than how the industry collapsed in 2008 for proof of that. Obama's auto rules don't prevent the industry from selling gas-guzzling cars and trucks, but they do force the companies to hedge their offerings. If they want to keep selling gas-hungry, profit-producing trucks, they'll most likely need to offset them with more fuel-efficient cars--even if that means jacking up the price of those trucks or dropping the price of those cars. That may sting in the near term, but when the price of oil begins to rise again, as it inevitably will, the companies won't be caught flat-footed as they have in the past. Instead, automakers will already have fuel-efficient vehicles to sell to fickle consumers as soon as they start grousing about prices at the pump. American car buyers are unlikely to ever fully consider what today's purchase means for tomorrow--either economically for them, or environmentally for all of us. But thanks to the president's new fuel economy rules, automakers now have no other choice."	America's Latest SUV-Buying Binge Shows Just How Great Obama's Auto Rules Are

The executive summary released last week makes only passing reference to an integral component of the CIA program: the ""extraordinary rendition"" of prisoners to foreign custody for ""interrogation"" by those countries' intelligence services--with the full knowledge that the men would be tortured. Because rendition was beyond the report's scope, there's still no official account of the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of other victims of torture that the CIA is responsible for. As the Washington Post revealed in 2005, the CIA identified two categories of prisoners for detention and interrogation: ""high value"" detainees that the agency held onto and ""second tier"" ones who were farmed out for detention and interrogation to other governments. As former CIA officer Bob Baer explained in disturbing detail, ""If you want a serious interrogation, you send a prisoner to Jordan. If you want them to be tortured, you send them to Syria. If you want someone to disappear--never to see them again--you send them to Egypt."" How many detainees met such fates? The Post reported that more than twice as many prisoners were rendered by the CIA to foreign governments as were held by the agency. Since we now know that 119 men were held by the CIA, that would mean at least 238 people were sent to other countries. And this figure could be much higher: In his January 2003 State of the Union address, President George W. Bush said that ""more than 3,000 suspected terrorists have been arrested in many countries."" Much of what we know about this practice of outsourcing torture is from the harrowing accounts of its victims and survivors who have bravely come forward to tell their stories. One of them is Ahmed Agiza, an Egyptian citizen who lived with his wife and young family in Sweden, where they were seeking refugee status. In December 2001, Ahmed and a friend were apprehended by Swedish police, who turned them over to the CIA. In what was reportedly the Bush administration's first rendition operation, Ahmed and his friend were sent to Egypt, where they were held incommunicado by Egyptian Intelligence Services, interrogated, and mercilessly tortured. In an unfair trial in 2004, Ahmed was convicted and sentenced to 25 years for membership in an organization banned under Egyptian law. The next year, an official Swedish investigation confirmed that the CIA had been involved in the rendition operation, and that the agency had cruelly and inhumanely treated the two men during their capture and transportation to Egypt. The U.N. Committee Against Torture and the U.N. Human Rights Committee also verified the men's claims of torture and inhumane treatment in Egypt. The Swedish government compensated Ahmed for its role in his torture, and later granted him official residence status. The ACLU filed a federal lawsuit against the American aviation company--Boeing subsidiary Jeppesen Dataplan--that provided logistical support to the CIA aircraft used to render the two men to torture in Egypt. The case was dismissed on the grounds that allowing it to continue would reveal ""state secrets."" The United States has yet to acknowledge its involvement in Ahmed's torture. Another victim is Abou Elkassim Britel, an Italian citizen of Moroccan descent, who was unlawfully rendered by the CIA from Pakistan to Morocco in May 2002. There, he was handed over to Moroccan intelligence agents and taken to the notorious Temara prison, where he was held incommunicado, interrogated, and tortured. He was imprisoned for more than eight months before being released in February 2003 without explanation or charge. Britel was also a plaintiff in the lawsuit against Jeppesen Dataplan, and the U.S. government has yet to own up to its role in his ordeal. A final disturbing story is that of Maher Arar, a Canadian citizen who was born in Syria and left at 17. Transiting through JFK airport on his way home from a family vacation in Tunisia in 2002, he was arrested and held virtually incommunicado for 13 days at a detention facility in Brooklyn. Then early one morning, the CIA secretly flew him in a private jet to Syria, even though he repeatedly told his American captors he would be tortured there. And so he was, brutally, once the CIA delivered him to Syrian intelligence. Maher was held in a coffin-like cell for nearly a year before the Canadian government secured his release home. A two-year-long official inquiry into the Canadian government's involvement in Maher's rendition found that he had been tortured, and that Canadian officials--in concert with their U.S. counterparts--were complicit. The Canadian government apologized and compensated Maher for his suffering. Maher brought a federal lawsuit with the Center for Constitutional Rights in an attempt to hold the U.S. government accountable, but Justice Department lawyers successfully argued that his case should be dismissed because it concerned matters of ""national security"" and ""foreign relations."" In 2010, the Supreme Court let the dismissal stand. To this day, the United States will neither confirm nor deny its role in Maher's rendition and torture, let alone apologize. Because the Senate report covers only prisoners held by the CIA, there is still no official accounting of what happened to these men and others like them, forcibly disappeared and handed over to foreign governments for torture. We don't even know whether the practice was authorized--and if so, by whom--and who was subject to it. We don't have details of the inhumane treatment and torture that these individuals faced at the hands of CIA officials, or once in the hands of the CIA's foreign partners. Just as the victims of CIA torture named in the Senate torture report deserve justice, so do those who aren't in the report. Investigating and publicly acknowledging their stories would be a good start, followed by criminal prosecutions and compensation where justified."

Yes, the ""invisible primary"" of jockeying and influence has been going on since the end of the last election. But it's only been in the last few days that the structure of the field, on both sides, has become clearer. For Democrats, clarity means the picture is still static. Hillary Clinton still towers over every potential competitor, the most popular person in the Democratic Party not named Barack or Michelle. Need proof? In a survey released this week, 50 percent of Americans said they could support Clinton in an election. And in a hypothetical primary--drawn from an average of available polls--almost two-thirds of Democrats support Clinton over everyone else in the field, from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to Vice President Biden. And, contrary to some observers, this isn't like 2006 or 2007. Then, Clinton was a modest favorite in the field. Now, she's the undisputed leader. Where things have changed are in the internal dynamics of the party. A year ago, the left of the Democratic Party didn't have an ideological leader. Now, it arguably does in the form of Warren. Many see this as a prelude to a presidential run, but it's just as likely that she tries to institutionalize her influence as a party broker, someone who speaks for liberal Democrats and can claim concessions in return for support. Or, as Dana Milbank argues for the Washington Post, a left-wing analogue to former South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint, who now serves as president of the conservative Heritage Foundation. If that's true, then the ambiguity of Warren's status in the presidential race--""Is she running?""--is a strategic choice. The more Clinton, or anyone else, is worried about a Warren insurgency, the more likely it is that that person will try to adopt her positions or assuage her concerns as an ideological leader. No, the eventual Democratic nominee won't be Elizabeth Warren, but she might sound like her. On the Republican side, chaos still reigns. On Thursday, political scientist Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia published a ranking of the GOP presidential field. It has seven sections--from an empty ""first tier"" of front-runners to a seventh tier of shameless hucksters--and 21 candidates, including Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. But of all of these candidates and potential candidates, we now have a standout. On Tuesday, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush announced that he was exploring a presidential run, following discussions with family and supporters over the Thanksgiving holiday. ""As a result of these conversations and thoughtful consideration of the kind of strong leadership I think America needs, I have decided to actively explore the possibility of running for President of the United States,"" Bush wrote in a message on Facebook. The case for Bush is easy to make. The son of one president and the brother of another, he has deep ties to the donor class of the Republican Party, which--according to the New York Times--might try to coalesce around a single candidate in the early stages of the primaries. Indeed, with his moderate beliefs on immigration and conservative orthodoxy on taxes, he appeals to the business-oriented and ""establishment"" officials and lawmakers in the party. And while it seems Bush would have trouble with actual Republican voters, who favor hard-line leaders like Walker or Texas Gov. Rick Perry, it's also true that these are voters who chose an architect of Obamacare--former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney--to run against President Obama. Bush's heresies on immigration and Common Core are big, but they're not fatal. And they're balanced by his staunch social conservatism--Bush, remember, was the man who ordered doctors to keep Terri Schiavo on life support in 2003. With all of that said, I am very skeptical that Bush could survive the primaries. It's not so much his qualifications as it is his skill, drive, and personality. The first warning sign is his stated aim for a candidacy. Here's the New York Times:"	Why Elizabeth Warren Won't Run and Jeb Bush Won't Win
9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/fuel_prices_and_airfares_airlines_are_making_record_profits_don_t_bet_on.html	"Americans making the drive to grandma's house this Christmas will arrive with a little more cash in their wallets than they might have expected. Those traveling by air won't be so lucky. The average price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline was hovering around $2.50 on Wednesday, down roughly 22 percent from this time last year. U.S. airlines have been getting even more of a bargain, with the price of jet fuel falling by 32 percent during that same period. The difference, though, is that Americans aren't seeing any relief when they book their tickets home for the holidays. The average domestic airfare has actually increased 3 percent--or about $10--this year, according to government figures and independent estimates. Fuel accounts for anywhere between a third and half of airlines' operating costs. If the price of jet fuel has plummeted, then why haven't airfares fallen along with it? The short answer is that profit-seeking airlines have no reason to charge less. Thanks to a string of megamergers--Continental with United, Northwest with Delta, AirTran with Southwest, and, most recently, US Airways with American--airlines now have less competition, and consumers have fewer choices. Those four major U.S. airlines now account for roughly 80 percent of domestic capacity. Less than a decade ago, 80 percent of domestic capacity was spread among 11 carriers. Demand, meanwhile, has grown--this despite passengers being nickeled, dimed, and $20-billed for everything from midflight snacks to mandatory bag-checking. Airlines are now selling a record 85.1 percent of available seats on domestic flights. That's good for the carriers' bottom lines. North American airlines expect their profits to grow from $11.9 billion this year to $13.2 billion next year, and Southwest and American both just had record quarters. It's bad, however, for anyone looking for a cheap flight, as declining fuel prices haven't led airlines to pass those savings along to customers. That lack of largesse has Sen. Chuck Schumer calling for the Department of Justice and Department of Transportation to investigate the industry. ""At a time when the cost of fuel is plummeting and profits are rising, it is curious and confounding that ticket prices are sky-high and defying economic gravity,"" the New York Democrat said in a statement this week. ""I'm urging the feds to step in and do a price investigation on behalf of consumers who must buy holiday travel tickets that can break the bank."" In crafting this populist message, Schumer is, not surprisingly, oversimplifying the issues at play here. It is not realistic to expect airfares to immediately rise and fall in tandem with fuel costs. Unlike drivers, who pay today for the gas they're using that very day, airlines sign long-term fuel contracts as a way of hedging against an unpredictable market. That means much of the jet fuel that carriers are burning now was purchased months ago, when prices were higher. Of course, those long-term contracts cut both ways--that's the point of a hedge, after all. Carriers are flying on slightly more expensive fuel today, but the contracts they're signing now mean they'll be flying on less expensive fuel in the future. Does that mean the carriers will reduce airfares in a few months' time, even if fuel costs rise?  Maybe not--and that's why it's fair to criticize them. The International Air Transport Association, the industry's largest trade group, suggested last week that the average ticket price could fall by as much as 5 percent in 2015 if current trends continue--but even then, the group says, consumers won't get any relief until next summer at the earliest. Only time will tell if the airlines deliver on that open-ended promise. The group's U.S. counterpart, Airlines for America, meanwhile, is offering no such assurances even in a hypothetical cheap-fuel future. As American Airlines President Scott Kirby recently told investors, ""In a strong demand environment, we don't plan to go off and just proactively cut fares."" Airlines aren't the only corporations whose response to fuel price fluctuations lines up neatly with their quest for profits. When the wholesale price of gas jumps, for instance, your local gas station scrambles to hike its prices. When the wholesale price falls, they're not in such a hurry. A 2010 study by the Federal Trade Commission found that retailers shift prices four times more quickly when the wholesale price of gas climbs than when it falls. Given that airlines face far less competition than your corner gas station, they have the luxury of reacting even faster when it serves them and slower when it doesn't. As an added wrinkle, those low-and-getting-lower gas prices may actually help airlines charge more for flights. Economists estimate that the average American household could save as much as $750 annually on gas--extra cash that carriers are hoping consumers turn around and spend on air travel. Despite Schumer's calls for a federal investigation, don't expect Congress to come to the rescue. As the New York Times' editorial board pointed out this week, airlines are using some of their newfound profits to expand their political power. Earlier this year, the industry began lobbying lawmakers to revoke a rule that forces carriers to advertise airfares that include taxes, as opposed to pretax prices that would be more enticing. The GOP-controlled House signed off on that change this summer. The measure stalled in the Senate, but the proposal is expected to get a second life once Republicans take over in the upper chamber next year. If airlines ultimately get their way, then the cheap airfares Americans are most likely to see next year will be ones that are literally too good to be true."

""I'm sorry for something I didn't do,"" he sings. ""Lynched somebody, but I don't know who."" In an interview with Steven Blush, author of American Hardcore: A Tribal History, MacKaye recalled how ""people would beat the shit out of me or rob me because I was white."" Unsurprisingly, ""Guilty of Being White"" became a favorite song of white-power militants. MacKaye, though, was aiming for something entirely different: ""People were judging me on the color of my skin, so I wrote what I thought was a really direct anti-racist song--I wanted to say something radical."" MacKaye was asking to be judged as an individual rather than as a convenient, scrawny stand-in for unnamed oppressors who were nowhere to be seen. I bring this up because it strikes me as the exact opposite of the sentiment behind the ""Criming While White"" social media phenomenon. After the grand jury decisions not to indict a pair of white police officers for killing black men Michael Brown and Eric Garner, white people used the #CrimingWhileWhite Twitter hashtag to chronicle various moments when police officers gave them the benefit of the doubt, presumably because of some combination of their race and social status. The point of this exercise is to demonstrate that even brazenly disrespectful behavior, like blowing marijuana smoke in the face of a police officer, will be overlooked or forgiven if the offender is white. The implicit counterpoint: If the offender was black, or more specifically a young black man, the consequences of such infractions could have been dire, even deadly. MacKaye's younger self resented being blamed for crimes he didn't commit. #CrimingWhileWhite asks that whites reflect on how often they've been found not guilty of crimes they did commit. This shift from resentment to self-critique reflects the broader conversation around white privilege in 2014. Today, that discourse insists that whites confront the various ways they benefit from racial inequality, even if--like a young Ian MacKaye--they don't believe they've done anything wrong as individuals. I wonder if the racial self-flagellation of #CrimingWhileWhite is like buying an indulgence. If you engage in ritualized expressions of white guilt, you are free to enjoy your white privilege, comfortable in the knowledge that you are nothing like those ignorant and presumably terrible white people who refuse to do so. I have little patience for this kind of privilege-checking. As Phoebe Maltz Bovy observed back in May, invocations of white privilege are more often than not a way for one privileged person to ""win a sensitivity competition"" with another privileged person. What, then, is a useful way to think about what white privilege means and how it works? In my view, the key to understanding white privilege is in this question: How can you benefit from racial inequality without being a racist? It's true, and important to understand, that white people often have the privilege of getting the benefit of the doubt from law enforcement. Or to put it in another, starker way: White people are less likely to be killed by police officers. It's also important to understand the social and economic components of white privilege. The basic idea, as described by scholars like Nancy DiTomaso, author of The American Non-Dilemma, and Daria Roithmayr, author of Reproducing Racism, is that all kinds of valuable social goods are transmitted through social networks. If you hear of a job opening at your company, you will likely pass that information along to a close friend or relative. I've shared information in this insider-y way, and I'm guessing that you have as well--if you don't, then the people you value and respect might value and respect you a little bit less. Why does white privilege come into play here? Because most Americans, like most humans, associate with people much like themselves. Robert P. Jones of the Public Religion Research Institute has found that the social networks of white Americans are 91 percent white, and three-quarters of whites have entirely white social networks. This shouldn't be too shocking, as most Americans are non-Hispanic whites and there are many neighborhoods in which making nonwhite friends would take a great deal of effort. Looking at these relationships through an exclusively racial lens can be misleading, as factors like the neighborhood you live in, the high school you attended, and your religious background could be doing more of the work than any preference for associating with other people of your own race. But the neighborhoods we live in and the high schools and churches we attend tend to be segregated by race, so even the mildest same-race preference will get magnified by these other avenues. Since white people hold a disproportionately large share of the most lucrative and the most powerful jobs, the natural tendency to help those you care about most ends up reinforcing racial inequality. There is nothing intrinsically white about helping your friends and relatives. When it comes to building self-reinforcing social networks, one could even make the case that other groups are beating whites at their own game. Recently, Chris Martin, a graduate student in sociology at Emory University, and John Nezlek, a social psychologist at the College of William and Mary, found that people consistently underestimate the median household income of Asian Americans, and that people who believe that whites are highly privileged were particularly likely to assume that Asian-American households earn less than white households. This is despite the fact that Asian-American households have had higher incomes than white households for more than 30 years. Does this mean that we ought to talk about Asian-American privilege more and white privilege less? Not without acknowledging what ""privilege"" means in the context of different groups. If anything, newcomers to American society and their children might find themselves more dependent on friends and relatives than deeply rooted whites, and thus more likely to cultivate and maintain these ties in an environment that seems alien and at times hostile. Those who arrive with high levels of educational attainment are particularly well-positioned to take advantage of job opportunities, and to share inside information with their co-ethnics. Virtually all Taiwanese immigrants benefit from the fact that 74.1 percent of American adults of Taiwanese origin have at least a bachelor's degree. Similarly, the life chances of college-educated Hmong Americans are affected in all kinds of ways by the fact that 37.9 percent of American adults of Hmong origin have less than a high school diploma. Imagine if we could rigorously apply a similar subgroup analysis to white Americans. The Census doesn't capture data on educational and labor market outcomes for religious minorities like Jews and Mormons, yet there is evidence that people have a much greater tendency to associate with narrower ethno-religious groups than with fellow members of larger racial groups. Even so, we don't generally speak of Jewish privilege or Mormon privilege. The language of white privilege also obscures the ravaging effects of poverty in heavily white regions like Appalachian Kentucky, where drug abuse is rampant and privilege-checking seems almost totally irrelevant. Why does the white privilege conversation ignore the ways in which Asian Americans have used their social ties to achieve success, or the yawning chasm that separates upper-middle-income Mormon Californians from impoverished Appalachian whites? The simple answer is that we talk about white privilege as a clumsy way of talking about black exclusion. Even white Americans of modest means are more likely to have inherited something, in the form of housing wealth or useful professional connections, than the descendants of slaves. In his influential 2005 book When Affirmative Action Was White, Ira Katznelson recounts in fascinating detail the various ways in which the New Deal and Fair Deal social programs of the 1930s and 1940s expanded economic opportunities for whites while doing so unevenly at best for blacks, particularly in the segregated South. Many rural whites who had known nothing but the direst poverty saw their lives transformed as everything from rural electrification to generous educational benefits for veterans allowed them to build human capital, earn higher incomes, and accumulate savings. This legacy, in ways large and small, continues to enrich the children and grandchildren of the whites of that era. This is the stuff of white privilege. What's fascinating about this moment in American history is that our anxiety about white privilege is ramping up at a time when the United States is getting progressively less white. Younger Americans are far less white than their older counterparts--roughly 43 percent of millennial adults are nonwhite, as are half of all newborns. It is worth noting that blacks represent a minority of nonwhite millennials. Most nonwhite millennials are first- and second-generation Americans, for whom the issues of historical justice that are so salient in the case of black disadvantage apply only imperfectly. That doesn't change the fact that first- and second-generation nonwhite millennials face challenges that their white native-born counterparts do not--that they are generally poorer, and that they don't have networks that are as extensive or as influential as their white counterparts. Still, will the conversation we're having about white privilege sound the same in 10, 20, or 50 years, as whites go from being a numerically dominant majority to just another group looking out for its own interests? In Blurring the Color Line, CUNY Graduate Center sociologist Richard Alba argues that rapid aging of white America creates an opportunity for younger Latinos, blacks, and Asians. Even if whites want to hoard all of the most privileged jobs for themselves, they'll have no choice but to open up competition to those with the necessary skills, regardless of race. But this process of opening things up, as WASPs did for southern and eastern European immigrants and their children in an earlier era, will go far more smoothly if we have a growing economy, which will give everyone an opportunity to climb the social ladder. If we instead have economic stagnation, we will see a fierce zero-sum contest for economic and political power, in which tribal identities--including white identity--will become more central. I'd argue that this is exactly what we're living through right now: If everyone's wages were growing, and if everyone felt secure enough in their jobs to quit every now and again in search of better opportunities elsewhere, I doubt that we'd be talking quite so much about white privilege. We'd definitely talk about broken schools and mass incarceration and law enforcement policies that disproportionately damage the lives of nonwhites. Yet we might talk about these problems in a more forward-looking way, as formidable obstacles that need to be overcome by all Americans, not just guilty whites."	What White Privilege Really Means
11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/ted_cruz_and_mike_lee_helped_appoint_obama_surgeon_general_the_conservative.html	"It won't last long, but at least for one day, Democrats are celebrating Sen. Ted Cruz. On Monday, the Senate confirmed controversial surgeon general nominee Vivek Murthy, and many on the left and right are thanking (or blaming) the Texas freshman for that. Democrats argue that a procedural tactic that the Texas Republican and fellow conservative Sen. Mike Lee undertook over the weekend is responsible for opening the door for the confirmation of a number of President Obama's executive and judicial nominees, including Murthy. Cruz and Lee have won snarky adulation from Democrats and blistering criticism from more establishment-friendly members of their own party, and Murthy's narrow confirmation win (51 to 43) may intensify those sentiments in the days to come. Late on Friday, Cruz and Lee kept Majority Leader Harry Reid from adjourning the Senate for the weekend as part of a last-ditch effort to block funding for the president's immigration move. That tactical strategy didn't work, but Cruz did wrangle a vote on a point of order calling the president's move unconstitutional. That vote failed, 22 to 74. Republican senators tore into Cruz and Lee, according to Politico. Sen. Kelly Ayotte said their strategy was ""ridiculous,"" Sen. Jeff Flake called it ""counterproductive,"" and Sen. Susan Collins told Cruz he was ""going to make everybody miserable."" Off the Hill, Lee and Cruz found little succor. Daniel Horowitz at the Conservative Review went to bat for them, but the conservative Washington Examiner ran a deeply critical editorial on their move, and Daily Caller columnist Matt Lewis compared the pair to Sarah Palin and Christine O'Donnell--a comparison not intended to flatter. Even at Breitbart News, Caroline May recognized that their strategy ""gave Majority Leader Harry Reid time to advance a number of Obama's nominations."" So is Cruz Democrats' new best friend? At issue is the question of whether Cruz and Lee's weekend move will result in more of the president's nominees getting confirmed than would have been otherwise. On this front, it seems to be Cruz and Lee largely contra mundum. On Fox News (per Breitbart), Lee defended the move by arguing that Reid would never have adjourned the Senate without getting votes for all of the president's nominees. But a top Democratic Senate aide close to the confirmation proceedings disputed that logic. He said that though Murthy and two other controversial nominees--Sarah Saldana to head Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Tony Blinken for deputy secretary of state--would have gotten confirmation votes regardless, those votes would have been a few days later in the week. The aide argued that if that had happened--which would have been the case if not for the weekend's activity--then it's possible Democratic senators would have skipped town, and Reid could have been a few votes shy of getting them confirmed. In a rare moment of warm and fuzzy bipartisanship, Republicans concurred. ""Maybe Cruz wanted to give Obama more nominees because he's hoping Democrats will return the favor if he becomes president,"" said a senior Republican aide. Another Republican aide echoed that point. ""At some point, Cruz is going to have to stop undermining conservative victories for the sake of getting more press,"" he said, blaming the Texas Republican for Murthy's confirmation. ""We had made a lot of progress and he just undid it all for something he knew was not going to be possible."" Murthy is controversial because he was politically active in favor of the president. The National Rifle Association also lobbied hard against his confirmation because of his stance on gun rights; he famously tweeted that ""guns are a health care issue."" Democrats seem to be enjoying thanking Cruz for his assist. Sen. Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, tweeted that he ""[w]as worried Dr. Vivek Murthy might not get confirmed but thanks to @TedCruz, looks like he will."" And Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson tweeted, ""I mean this sincerely: thank you, Senator Cruz."" Talking Points Memo has more detail here on the Cruz love that emerged from Democrats' ranks over the weekend. Some Republicans--while angry with Cruz--have tried to take some of the sting out. Sen. Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican, told reporters before the Murthy vote that he thought Reid would have gotten all of his nominees confirmed regardless of the extra time over the weekend. Sen. John McCain was in the opposite camp and said the Cruz and Lee strategy was a flop. ""I don't see any positive result,"" he said. And Nevada Republican Sen. Dean Heller said Cruz's ""shenanigans"" left many members of his party irked. ""I think we'll have more nominees than otherwise,"" he said. ""He had an opportunity to stand up at lunch any day this last week, to give us a heads up and tell us his goals and let us be aware,"" the senator continued. ""I think that's the only frustration in this: He waits till everybody goes home and then pulls it off."" In an email, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier suggested some of his Republican critics could be acting in bad faith. ""Unfortunately, there are many on both sides of the aisle who want to distract from the more important debate over the president's unilateral action to grant amnesty,"" she wrote."	Ted Cruz Just Did Obama a Big Favor
12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/ferguson_s_evidence_exposes_bias_and_prejudice_on_all_sides_al_sharpton.html	"On Dec. 3, a Staten Island grand jury decided not to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the death of Eric Garner. Most Americans, in subsequent polls, have rejected this decision. Blacks are more unanimous than whites. But in each survey, nearly two-thirds of whites who express an opinion have agreed that the grand jury's decision was disappointing or wrong. The general agreement about Garner raises two questions. One is why the grand jury didn't indict Pantaleo. That question touches on thorny issues of race and police discretion. But the other question is just as difficult: Why didn't the case that preceded Garner's--the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri--produce similar agreement? Did race affect the two cases differently? Or was the evidence in Brown's case simply less persuasive? Initially, there were many reasons to be suspicious about Brown's shooting. Ferguson is two-thirds black, but its 53-person police force had only three black officers. The cops there had a record of racial profiling. Brown's body was left in the street for hours, and when protests erupted, police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. The evidence against Darren Wilson, the white officer who killed Brown, was assessed not in a trial but in a grand jury, with no systematic cross-examination of his testimony. For these reasons and others, some people will always believe that Wilson murdered Brown and got away with it. Others will believe just as stubbornly that Brown was a criminal and Wilson was simply doing his job. The pro-cop story has plenty of problems: We now know that Wilson had no Taser and that he washed his hands afterward and bagged his own gun as evidence. But the anti-cop story has problems, too. The story, as originally told, was that Wilson accosted Brown for walking in the street, that he grabbed Brown, that Brown fled, and that Wilson hunted him down and shot him dead as Brown was cowering in surrender. That story doesn't fit the evidence. The grand jury records, flawed as they are, rule out much of the narrative. To understand how the story took hold, and why many of us still cling to it, we have to go back to Aug. 9, the day of Brown's death. Some people who saw the killing, or claimed to have seen it, described a daylight execution. This account, which otherwise might have seemed incredible, was believed in part because of Ferguson's history and in part because of cases that appeared similar to it. In March, Victor White, a black man in Louisiana, had died from a gunshot wound while his hands were cuffed behind his back in a squad car--and police had called it a suicide. In July, Garner, accused of selling cigarettes illegally, had been put in a fatal chokehold for refusing to be handcuffed. Civil rights activists see such incidents all too often. One of these activists, the Rev. Al Sharpton, was at the center of the debate about Ferguson. In retracing the evolving narrative about Brown, Sharpton is a useful case study. At 60, Sharpton is an elder statesman of the civil rights movement, preaching nonviolence and police accountability. Sharpton visited Ferguson several times after Brown's death, speaking at Brown's funeral and memorial service. On his MSNBC program, Sharpton in effect chronicled the narrative's emergence and its persistence in the face of confounding revelations. In the first days after the shooting, Sharpton construed Brown's death as the latest in a grim tradition: ""one story after another about police force used against unarmed African-Americans."" Sharpton told viewers, ""This isn't just about one case of questionable behavior by a single officer. This is about a systemic and common problem in the American justice system."" Sharpton was hardly alone in this view. Millions of Americans had the same reaction. And they were right about problems in the justice system. In that context, the portrait of Brown as a harmless kid made sense. In Sharpton's first broadcast after the shooting, and in a press conference a day later, he described Brown as a ""gentle giant."" Sharpton ridiculed the idea that Brown could have done anything to provoke the confrontation: ""I understand he was never in trouble. Wasn't a bad kid at all. Yet they are trying to say that he got into a scuffle."" Six days after the shooting, police released surveillance video of Brown stealing cigars from a convenience store just before his encounter with Wilson. This seemed to fit the prevailing narrative: The cops were leaking irrelevant dirt to smear the victim. Even Missouri's governor said it was out of line. Sharpton pronounced the video irrelevant and dismissed the recorded incident as ""shoplifting."" Many people were too angry at the leak to focus on what the video showed: Brown had intimidated and shoved the clerk who tried to stop the theft. The video didn't fit the image of a gentle giant. Defenders of the original narrative reasoned that even if Brown had done what Wilson alleged--punched the officer through his car window and grabbed his gun--it couldn't excuse what happened afterward: Wilson had pursued Brown, shooting him in the back and killing him as Brown tried to surrender. On his program, Sharpton played clips of witnesses saying that bullets had ""struck [Brown] in the back"" while he was ""running away."" But that part of the story appeared to unravel two days later, when an autopsy report commissioned by Brown's family showed that Brown had no wounds in his back. Sharpton and his on-air guests groped for explanations. They ventured that one of Brown's arm wounds ""could have been from the back,"" though the clip Sharpton played to support his interpretation--a witness saying that Brown's ""body jerked"" after he was struck from behind--sounded more like a hit to the torso. Perhaps the part about shots in the back was a misunderstanding. Still, the final seconds of the crime seemed undeniable: Brown had stood or knelt in surrender, and Wilson had shot him while closing in. ""Hands up, don't shoot"" was the new rallying cry. At a gathering in Ferguson, Sharpton urged people to raise their arms in protest, ""because that's the sign Michael was using ... a surrender sign."" Sharpton dismissed Wilson's account--that he had shot Brown because Brown was coming at him--as absurd. Then the surrender story, too, began to falter. On Aug. 19, the New York Times reported that some witnesses were backing Wilson's version. While some said Brown ""was not moving and may even have had his hands up,"" the Times cautioned, others said Brown had ""moved toward Officer Wilson, possibly in a threatening manner, when the officer shot him dead."" Even Brown's friend, Dorian Johnson, had conceded under FBI interrogation that Brown's hands ""were not that high, and that one was lower than the other."" Johnson's story about the initial struggle at the police car--that Wilson had ""reached out of the window with his left hand and grabbed Mr. Brown by the throat""--wasn't holding up, either. The Times said it was ""contrary to what several witnesses have told law enforcement officials."" Scenes that had once been described in clear terms were now a confused mess. By this point, however, Brown was so interwoven in the civil rights message that the legend of his death often went unquestioned. According to Johnson, Brown wouldn't have reached into the police car because he wasn't ""an aggressive person."" Brown's grandfather said Brown was too ""scared of guns"" to have grabbed Wilson's pistol. In a speech at Brown's funeral on Aug. 25, Sharpton repeated part of the original story--that Wilson had gone after Brown for ""walking in the middle of the street""--omitting the rest of Wilson's account, which was that he had blocked Brown's path only after recognizing him from a radio alert about the store theft. On Sept. 8 and Sept. 11, Sharpton told MSNBC viewers that ""every witness"" and ""virtually all the eyewitnesses"" agreed that Brown had his hands up. When the grand jury's decision was announced on Nov. 24--no indictment for Wilson--millions of people saw it as a betrayal of justice. But they also saw it as a vindication of the original narrative. At a press conference, Sharpton lamented that the legal process, rigged against Brown, had turned out just as he expected. He condemned the prosecutor for discrediting witnesses and questioning Brown's role in the tragedy. The grand jury process certainly was irregular. Prosecutors had treated the jurors as a fact-finding body instead of pushing for an indictment, and they hadn't seriously cross-examined Wilson. But the process and the evidence, while related, were two different things. A faulty process can produce real evidence, and that's what happened here. The testimony of dozens of witnesses, released to the public in thousands of pages, exposed the complexity of the case. Witnesses differed in their perceptions of what Brown had been doing with his hands in the final seconds. Most agreed that he had moved toward Wilson. Some thought he was giving up. Three affirmed that he had ""charged"" at the officer. Two said he hadn't, and five described his movement as ""walking."" The most surprising thing--and the most damning to the original narrative--was the forensic evidence. The swelling and bruises on Wilson's face didn't prove that Brown had punched him. But the original account of the struggle at the police car window--that Brown, at 290 pounds, had only sought to get away--was hard to square with the DNA Brown had left on Wilson's gun, the upper portion of Wilson's pants, and on the inside door handle of Wilson's car. The sooty wound on Brown's thumb was consistent with Wilson's claim that Brown had grabbed the gun. So was the angle of the bullet fired into the car door. At the scene of the fatal shooting, Brown's blood was found more than 20 feet beyond his body, in the direction going away from Wilson. This seemed to confirm--contrary to the original accounts of Brown being executed on the spot to which he had fled--that he had moved a considerable distance toward Wilson after being shot. Shell casings from Wilson's gun were consistent with the officer's testimony that he had retreated while firing his weapon. The forensics still leaves a lot of mysteries. And those mysteries, under normal procedures, should have gone to trial. Even then, it's unlikely that the witnesses would have agreed. We'll never know for certain what happened that day. But we do know that much of what we originally heard, and what many of us repeated, was false. We believed it not just because somebody said it but because we found it plausible. And that sense of plausibility was based, in part, on inferences from other incidents in which a black man died at the hands of police. In a word, we prejudged the case. This weekend, thousands of people marched in memory of Brown and Garner. They called on police, lawmakers, and all Americans to reflect on the perils of prejudgment and overreaction. That's a worthy lesson. But reflecting on mistakes isn't just a job for others. It's our responsibility, too."	All Sides Failed to Adjust Their Opinions to the Evidence in Ferguson
13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/cromnibus_pot_laws_washington_has_quietly_become_much_more_pro_pot_that.html	"Late Thursday night, the Republican-controlled House pushed through a $1.1-trillion spending package to keep the government's lights on through next summer. The Democratic-controlled Senate is expected to do the same before they head home for the holidays. Among the myriad policy riders buried inside the 1,600-plus-page bill is one aimed at blocking the Washington, D.C., City Council from legalizing recreational marijuana, something voters in the district instructed them to do by a margin of nearly 2-to-1 last month. That ban was inserted at the behest of a small band of anti-pot conservative hardliners led by Maryland Rep. Andy Harris, and ultimately neither the White House nor Democratic leaders were willing to make fighting it a priority. The rider is controversial and hypocritical, and it may well turn out to be moot. (D.C. officials think they may have found a legal loophole that will allow them to press forward with legalization anyway.) Still, it was a symbolic victory for legalization opponents who were desperate for one after voters in Oregon and Alaska joined D.C. in casting ballots in favor of recreational pot this fall. ""It shows legalization advocates that we are far from out of the game,"" Kevin Sabet, a former Obama drug policy adviser who has become one of the loudest critics of legalization, told USA Today. ""We have new political muscle that we intend to flex."" But despite that symbolic victory, it's a different pot-themed provision tucked deep inside the bill that offers a more accurate illustration of Washington's evolving position on legal weed--the Capitol's posture is quietly becoming much more supportive than the effort to block D.C.'s legalization effort might suggest. That less-discussed provision stops the Justice Department from spending a dime to prosecute patients or medical marijuana dispensaries that are acting in accordance with state law but running afoul of federal ones. The policy change might not make for splashy headlines, but it promises to have a major impact on the medical marijuana movement around the nation. The federal government still classifies pot as a Schedule I substance--as it does heroin--one the Drug Enforcement Administration says has ""no currently accepted medical use."" And while President Obama has given a qualified green light to states to experiment with both retail and medical weed, that hasn't stopped the DEA and several U.S. attorneys in recent years from raiding hundreds of medical dispensaries that were in compliance with state laws. Pro-pot advocates hope the spending bill should make such crackdowns a thing of the past. The provision could also derail a number of pending prosecutions currently winding their way through the legal system, including the federal case against the so-called Kettle Falls Five, a small group of friends and family facing mandatory 10-year prison terms for growing medical weed on their farm in eastern Washington. In sheer terms of people impacted, the medical provision will dwarf that of the more publicized D.C. ban, even assuming the latter survives a potential legal challenge. The District is home to roughly 640,000 people; California, one of 23 states where medical pot is legal, is home to more than 38 million. Forcing the federal government to respect state medical marijuana laws has long been a goal of the legalization movement, but one that had previously proved unattainable. Similar legislation had repeatedly stalled in Congress over the past decade before the GOP-controlled House unexpectedly passed a version of the measure this summer. The pro-pot crowd rejoiced then even though no one expected the bill to reach the Senate floor anytime in the foreseeable future. ""Watershed is probably too strong of a word,"" long-term legalization crusader Ethan Nadelmann of the Drug Policy Alliance told me at the time, ""but it was pretty close."" Nearly as noteworthy as the medical marijuana decision is the states-rights logic that is driving support from the Republican side of the aisle. ""The enactment of this legislation will mark the first time in decades that the federal government has curtailed its oppressive prohibition of marijuana and has instead taken an approach to respect the many states that have permitted the use of medical marijuana to some degree,"" Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, the California Republican who was part of the bipartisan effort to include the medical marijuana language in the larger spending bill, said in a statement this week. Suggestions of ""oppressive prohibition"" aside, Obama has actually given states remarkable leeway to experiment with weed, even if he's refused to give them an unqualified free pass to do so. His administration has largely taken a wait-and-see approach to retail markets like those already underway in Colorado and Washington state, and his administration has likewise taken small steps to encourage banks to do business with those companies involved in the quasi-legal pot trade. Those actions haven't been without their conservative critics, of course. Republicans have repeatedly blasted Obama for not enforcing statutes that are on the books, be they immigration laws or drug ones. The so-called Enforce the Law Act that the House passed earlier this year included a committee report that criticized Obama for his laissez faire approach in Colorado and Washington state. And the D.C. ban makes it clear that there are plenty of GOP lawmakers who remain strongly opposed to legalized weed of any kind. Still, it's telling that the biggest pot-related fight this week was over explicit legalization in the nation's capital, while a sweeping provision that could fundamentally reshape how the federal government treats medical marijuana slipped through with hardly a peep. That just goes to show how far the battle lines have shifted in the favor of the pro-pot crowd and suggests that, in spite of the potential setback in the District itself, the future for their side in Washington is a brighter one."

I'm Betsy Woodruff, and I just started writing about politics here. (This is my seventh week, if I'm counting right--I'm not on the math beat, wokka wokka wokka.) Before working at Slate, I covered the midterm elections for the Washington Examiner and, before that, wrote for National Review magazine. My claims to fame at NR include living on bitcoin for a week and trying out for Star Wars. I didn't get the Star Wars gig--their loss--so here we are. Working here has been really fun and really busy. I followed Scott Walker around Wisconsin and Ferguson protesters around Walmart. On Wednesday, I wrote a story on how conservatives are winning the clickbait wars. But if you want to read about something other than the Tea Party News Network, there's been tons of great stuff on the site this week. Simon Doonan and Troy Patterson are owning the #WarOnChristmas beat (kidding! kidding!) They argued against the red/green color combo and advised writers on holiday greeting etiquette, respectively. More seriously, Joshua Keating had a thoughtful piece on how Congress' 2001 authorization for use of military force is allowing the U.S. to remain at war forever, and how President Obama has expanded Bush's War on Terror. It's not the cheeriest topic, but it's complicated and important, and Keating lays it out in a way that's accessible and straightforward. And, of course, Slate's analysis of Rolling Stone's disastrous campus rape story has been unparalleled. Just start at the top of Hanna Rosin's archive, and be sure to read her piece on how Rolling Stone made life terrible for their source, Jackie. While we're on that topic, Emily Yoffe's piece, ""The College Rape Overcorrection,"" couldn't have come at a more important time. It's really long, and all of it matters. Yoffe raises serious, difficult questions about the nature of our country's college rape problem, the quality of the data that gets thrown around about it, and the right way to make college safer for women.

He announced Tuesday that he's formed a leadership PAC called Right to Rise, which, if you're a person considering a presidential run, is as compulsory as releasing a weightless biography. A leadership PAC allows you to raise money, hire staff, commission polls, and prepare the infrastructure necessary to start an official campaign. That's why all the candidates who have been preparing to run in 2016-- Sen. Marco Rubio, Gov. Rick Perry, Sen. Rand Paul, and Sen. Ted Cruz--created PACs long ago. So Bush is late to the game. But when you form a political action committee far ahead of a race, you also allow financial backers to write you a check without making a real commitment. They offer tribute and embrace the pretense that your committee, Euphemisms for Ambition, is being formed simply to support candidates who share your views in the next election cycle (which for all the other presidential contenders was the 2014 cycle). Or donors can give to your leadership PAC as a way to support you in your current job as senator, without implying a commitment to your larger ambitions, which is the case for Cruz, Rubio, and Paul. There is no such fuzziness about Bush's PAC; he has created it for the presidential election, a race that he is likely close to entering. His request for money is a more direct appeal for financial support for his presidential ambitions. There are legal barriers that mean that giving to a PAC is not the same as giving to a campaign, but support for one entity at this point will be considered a pledge of support for the official campaign. ""There's only one office that Jeb is running for--or contemplating running for,"" says a GOP donor. ""So a donation to his leadership PAC is the equivalent of saying, 'Count me in!' "" Bush's team is hoping to speed up the process and lock down donors who have been playing footsie with other campaigns. The former Florida governor has a series of fundraisers scheduled in the coming weeks to make his appeal in person. Bush's move should quicken the activities of other candidates who now need to check in with the donors they were courting and perhaps make a few public moves of their own to show why their candidacy is just as viable as it was before Bush got in the race. Sen. Rubio of Florida is launching his book American Dreams next week, so he's one to watch closely. In his announcement video, Bush says he's hoping to elect conservative candidates, but he wouldn't go to the trouble of shooting an on-the-street video and asking donors to give their Instagram accounts if he were only planning to ladle glory onto others. The rollout of the PAC is another way in which the medium is the message for Bush. He promised to release 250,000 emails to demonstrate his commitment to transparency. In this case, he is trying to show that despite having been off the campaign trail since 2002, he's quicker on his feet than the competition. He's on Instagram! He's on a smartphone on the street! He's running a different kind of campaign, which matches his pitch that he's a different kind of Republican. Where this distinction will really matter is on the policy positions Bush ultimately advocates. In that way Bush's leadership PAC is different than the others, too. He is using it to send a message about what kind of a campaign he will run. On the PAC website the ""What We Believe"" section is built around the idea of income inequality. If that's the only place he talks about it, then it's meaningless. But that's not the expectation Bush is setting. He's sending the signal that he will talk a lot about the issue and how conservative principles can restore the American dream. Compare that with Mitt Romney, who during the 2012 campaign said the issue of income inequality should only be discussed in ""quiet rooms."" (Of course, Bush has his own considerable political challenges with Republican base voters on the issues of immigration, education, and taxes). Bush and his team are promising to go places Republicans don't normally go to campaign, to get the party ""out of its comfort zone."" That sounds like a version of what Rep. Paul Ryan has been trying to do as he has been arguing for conservative solutions to poverty and middle-class stagnation. Bush's leadership PAC (as well as his super PAC) takes its name from an expression Ryan has used. A Bush source says that Ryan gave Bush the OK to use the name. That could be considered the PAC's first donation."	Why Jeb Bush's Leadership PAC Isn't Like the Others
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/01/republicans_crisis_governance_can_a_gop_controlled_congress_govern_without.html	"For the first time since 2006, Republicans have control of the Senate. And what's their goal for the next two years, ahead of the presidential election? To govern like a sensible party. ""I don't want the American people to think that if they add a Republican president to a Republican Congress, that's going to be a scary outcome,"" said new Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in a pre-holiday interview with the Washington Post. ""I want the American people to be comfortable with the fact that the Republican House and Senate is a responsible, right-of-center, governing majority."" That may be a tall order. The last time Republicans had political momentum, after the 2010 elections, they plunged the United States into a year of crisis governance, including a threat to default on the debt if they didn't get concessions on spending cuts. The hit to the GOP's popularity was enormous, and it played a part in the 2012 presidential election, where President Obama ran against the Republican-controlled House and its dysfunction. Maybe McConnell can keep this from happening again. House Speaker John Boehner's caucus was, and remains, an unwieldy beast of deal-making Republicans and conservative true believers. Yes, McConnell's Senate has its share of the latter, but he doesn't seem to face the same internal dissent as Boehner, who has had to fend off challenges to his speakership. And even in this era of ""nuclear options,"" filibusters, and party-line, parliamentary-style voting, party dominance is a little weaker in the Senate than the House. Not only are there still areas of crossover voting, but the present Senate has a healthy number of Republicans who represent Democratic states, who--ahead of an election year--have a vested interest in working with the opposition. Boehner risks rebellion when he defies the majority of his majority. McConnell doesn't, at least not to the same extent. Still, there's cause for skepticism. Over the next year, reports Politico, Congress faces a number of critical legislative fights, not unlike the ""fiscal cliff"" of 2012. ""These problems can't be ignored and GOP leadership will have to decide if it wants to set up short-term solutions or negotiate permanent fixes to these long-lingering problems."" This year's hurdles include Medicare reimbursements--and specifically, the formula for paying providers--the highway trust fund (which will be insolvent by May), and the debt ceiling. ""These deals don't come together quickly,"" notes Politico, ""and could require leaders to spend their hard-earned political capital on brokering compromises."" For McConnell, this calculation is complicated by the composition of his majority. The 114th Congress brings a gaggle of new conservative senators on top of the existing bunch. In addition to Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who played Pied Piper to House Republicans during the 2013 shutdown drama, there's now Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Joni Ernst of Iowa, and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, all of whom fall on the right wing of the Republican Party. You could also add Sens. Cory Garnder of Colorado and Thom Tillis of North Carolina to that list, given their previous careers as right-wing congressman and right-wing state house speaker, respectively. It's possible that, for these lawmakers, their true nature is more pragmatic than what was on display on the campaign trail. But, popular belief notwithstanding, politicians tend to stick to what they say. No, Sen. Ernst might not move to impeach Obama, but she could use her influence to make life difficult for him, and use these ""cliffs"" as a chance for legislative leverage. The same goes for Sen. Cotton. A vocal critic of immigration reform, he might use his new influence to join a potential showdown over President Obama's immigration action. Indeed, as Greg Sargent writes for the Washington Post, the White House has promised a whole host of executive actions for 2015. Will conservatives react with calm? Or will they forgo a tactical approach for, as Sargent says, ""maximum confrontation?"" We should hope for the former. The crisis governance of the last few years was a blow to the standing of our parties and institutions. Congress is incredibly unpopular, and that kind of anger can breed futility--a sense that the process can't work. If nothing else, responsible Republican governance could counter this perception, and--per McConnell--potentially boost whomever the party chooses for its nominee in 2016. With that said, if you are on Team Intransigence--if, like Sen. Cruz, your goal is to muck up the works--you aren't without a case. In the last two years, you provoked a shut down and killed a bipartisan immigration bill. And what happened at the end of it? You won your largest majorities in almost 10 years. A constructive Republican Congress might be good for our democracy, but an obstructionist one--that rallies the base and builds enthusiasm--might be better politics."	Can Republicans Govern Without a Crisis?
17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/future_of_america_s_race_relations_why_i_am_optimistic_despite_ferguson.html	"On race relations, President Obama is feeling optimistic. At least, that's how he comes across in an interview with NPR's Steve Inskeep, who asks if ""the United States is more racially divided than it was"" when he took office. ""No,"" Obama says, ""I actually think that it's probably in its day-to-day interactions less racially divided."" If America seems more divided, he says, it's because we're more aware of our racial shortcomings. ""It's understandable the polls might say, you know, that race relations have gotten worse--because when it's in the news and you see something like Ferguson or the Garner case in New York, then it attracts attention."" And if many white Americans have a shocked response to claims of unfairness and discrimination, it's because it's outside their purview. ""If you'd asked whites in those jurisdictions,"" he said, referring to racial profiling in Illinois, 'Do you think traffic stops were done fairly?' the majority of whites probably would say 'yes' because it's not something they experience. It's not because of racism; it's just that it's not something that they see."" It's easy to dismiss this as undue optimism or a retreat to 2008-style post-racial thinking, especially given events in Cleveland, Ferguson, and New York, and the stark divide in how blacks and whites see law enforcement. But Obama isn't wrong. When it comes to race relations, America is better than it's ever been. The most obvious observation is the fact of Obama's election--and re-election--to the presidency. As a milestone in American life, this goes beyond electoral politics. ""The person who occupies that office is not only the head of the executive branch of the federal government,"" writes Harvard Law professor Randall Kennedy for the American Prospect, ""The president is also the nation's mourner-in-chief, booster-in-chief, spouse-in-chief, and parent-in-chief."" He continues: ""That a black man has been the master of the White House for the past six years does indeed reflect and reinforce a remarkable socio-psychological transformation in the American racial scene."" You can see this in the data. According to authors Lawrence D. Bobo of Harvard, Camille Z. Charles of the University of Pennsylvania, Maria Krysan of the University of Illinois, Chicago, and Alicia D. Simmons of Stanford University in ""The Real Record on Racial Attitudes""--a paper in the 2012 volume of Social Trends in American Life: Findings from the General Social Survey Since 1972--whites have progressed on a wide range of measures. As recently as 1990, more than 40 percent of whites supported a homeowner's right to discriminate on the basis of race; by 2008, that number had dropped to 28 percent (including 25 percent of highly educated Northern whites). The same goes for the percentage of whites who said blacks were ""less intelligent"" than whites, which dipped from nearly 60 percent in 1990 to less than 30 percent in 2008. And so few whites support school segregation that the General Social Survey has dropped the item from its questionnaire. Whites are also more tolerant of interracial marriage. When first measured in 1990, note the authors, fully 65 percent of whites opposed unions between close relatives and black Americans. By 2008, that number had declined to 25 percent, and in a 2013 Gallup survey, 84 percent of whites said they approved of interracial marriages between blacks and whites. Some of the most comprehensive polling-outside of the General Social Survey--comes from the Pew Research Center. According to a 2010 report, 64 percent of whites say they would be ""fine with it"" if a family member married a black American, while 27 percent say they would be ""bothered"" but accepting. Only 6 percent say they would reject the marriage. Support is lowest among older whites, and highest among white millennials, who don't differ in approval from their black and Hispanic peers. It's not all sunshine. As of 2008, according to the GSS, only a quarter of whites would live in a neighborhood that's half black, and in a 2000 survey, 1 in 5 whites chose an all-white neighborhood as an ideal, while 1 in 4 chose one without any blacks. A plurality of whites still say blacks aren't hard working--or at least, not as hard working as whites--and, notes Pew, most whites say the country has ""done enough to give blacks equal rights with whites."" There are intense disagreements on police treatment, and nearly one-half of white millennials say discrimination against whites is as big a problem as discrimination against minorities. And in terms of criminal justice and punitiveness, we know that whites are more likely to support harsher punishment when the convict is black. Still, we've made genuine gains, and our time is an incredible departure from the relatively recent past, when apartheid ruled the South and racist attitudes were ubiquitous in every area of national life. Even now, with the spike in racial turmoil, we see change. White and black Americans were outraged by the choking death of Eric Garner in New York City, white and black Americans have united in protests against police brutality, and the otherwise indifferent Republican Party--with its largely white constituency--has begun to make small moves toward criminal justice reform, with support from major donors like the Koch brothers. If, like President Obama, you are optimistic about the direction of American race relations, the facts are on your side. With that said, we shouldn't confuse optimism about race relations (or, again, how whites view blacks and other groups) with optimism about racial progress, or how groups fare in relation to each other. There, the news isn't just bad--it's bleak. This goes beyond the familiar facts about young black males and police violence. On the environmental front, black communities are exposed to more pollution--and suffer more pollution-related ailments--than any of their counterparts. Black unemployment is still double that of whites--even for college graduates--and the median wealth of black families has plunged since the Great Recession, all but erasing the gains of the previous three decades. Residential segregation and concentrated poverty are still the reality for many black Americans--the product of a half-century of discriminatory housing policy. Indeed, the typical middle-class black child encounters a level of poverty unknown to the vast majority of white children. Then there's mass incarceration. In his book Punishment and Inequality in America, sociologist Bruce Western shows that prison is the dominant--and most formative--institution in the lives of poor black men in the United States. This is only loosely connected to crime; while poor black men commit more crimes than most other Americans, prison population growth doesn't track national crime trends. In fact, crime among young black men has plunged, while incarceration has steadily increased. And incarceration isn't the reason for the decline. ""Roughly nine-tenths of the decline in serious crime through the 1990s would have happened without the prison boom,"" writes Western. The long-term implications of mass incarceration are too large to examine here, but it suffices to say two things. First, that mass imprisonment of poor black men casts a pall over our narrative of economic progress. After adjusting for disparities in joblessness and incarceration, Western found that ""young black men have experienced virtually no real economic gains on young whites in the fifteen years since 1999."" In fact, ""around three-quarters of the apparent gains in relative wages are attributable not to a real improvement in the economic situation of African Americans, but to escalating rates of joblessness and incarceration [among the group]."" The gains of young black men, touted in the heady days of the 1990s economic expansion, were illusory. Over all, because prison is a hugely corrosive influence on the course of an individual's life, a whole cohort of poor black men should expect lives with insecure employment, low wages, family disruption, and social isolation. In all likelihood, the stratification in the black community--where the difference between well-off and worst-off is huge--will widen. If the reality of changing white attitudes are grounds for racial optimism, then the fact of black stagnation and retrenchment are grounds for racial pessimism. And there's a strong case that the latter outweighs the former. Not only will these economic trends take decades to play out, but it's unclear if Americans are willing to devote the time and effort to closing our racial gaps and integrating poor black Americans into the national mainstream. If the present push against equal participation--exemplified by voter ID and conservative attacks on the Voting Rights Act--is any indication, it's hard to imagine a future where the public spends tax dollars to fix the consequences of its past discrimination. Worse, the same optimism around race relations could undermine a push to improve conditions--if things seem good, even if deep inequalities still exist, there's no reason to make them better. Then again, you could say the same of America in the 1950s. Blacks won major victories, but an end to Jim Crow--much less attempts to ameliorate its effects--seemed far on the horizon. By the end of the 1960s, however, we had outlawed segregation, gained voting rights, outlawed housing discrimination, and oriented the entire federal government toward securing opportunity for black Americans. Yes, there were fierce reactions from the right, and many of the policies and gains have been compromised or--in criminal justice--actively undermined. But even at the height of the post-civil rights backlash, in the conservative jubilee of the Reagan years, there was no question that blacks were better off. This isn't the soft bigotry of low expectations--it's meaningful change. The black struggle for equal rights--for full partnership in the American experiment--obviously isn't over. The proof is everywhere, from an unfair criminal justice system to an economy that discards black potential. If there is a question, it goes back to optimism versus pessimism. Should our steady progression make us optimistic? Or are our short memories (""redlining"" means nothing to most Americans), backsliding (""Redemption"" followed Reconstruction, mass incarceration followed the end of Jim Crow), and retreat to myth (We made it on our own, why can't they do it) cause for pessimism? As best I can, I live my life as an optimist. But there are times I'm convinced failure is inevitable, that we'll never shake ourselves of white supremacy and its legacy. But even if that's true--even if the struggle is doomed and that's our tragedy as Americans--the battle is still worth fighting. To borrow from William James, ""If this life be not a real fight, in which something is eternally gained for the universe by success, it is no better than a game of private theatricals from which one may withdraw at will. But it feels like a real fight--as if there were something really wild in the universe which we, with all our idealities and faithfulnesses, are needed to redeem."""

18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/why_rep_steve_scalise_spoke_to_a_white_nationalist_hate_group_racism_in.html	"On Monday the House of Representatives' majority whip, Steve Scalise of Louisiana, confirmed that he gave at least one speech to a recognized white nationalist hate group, the European-American Unity and Rights Organization. EURO was founded by David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard. The May 2002 conference Scalise participated in was billed as a workshop on protecting white ""civil rights"" and ""heritage."" According to a conference attendee who posted on Stormfront, a white supremacist forum, Rep. Scalise spoke about how the Department of Housing and Urban Development was a ""slush fund"" that gave money away to ""a selective group based on race."" Scalise's spokeswoman, Moira Bagley, said that when the congressman spoke to EURO as a state representative, he had been unaware of the group's views. Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, told me, ""EURO already was well-known as a racist hate group at the time that Steve Scalise apparently spoke to its workshop, and it is hard to believe that any aspiring politician would not have known that. In any case, it's worth noting that Scalise apparently did not leave even after hearing other racist speakers spouting their hatred."" Why would a congressman speak to this group? Scalise's choice to speak shows the incredible power prejudice still wields in modern Louisiana. My friend Lamar White, a Louisiana journalist, broke the story about Scalise by publishing the Stormfront posts about the speech on Sunday. Louisiana has had a long history of racism, and White knows it well. His great-aunt, historian Sue Eakin, rediscovered the book that was the basis for the film 12 Years a Slave. Earlier this year I tagged along as White was interviewed by the BBC for a series about the movie's reverberations in Louisiana. Solomon Northup, the movie's main character, spent the 12 years that he was kidnapped and enslaved on various plantations in Central Louisiana, and the descendants of the people in the film, slaves and masters, still live in the area. Names like Epps and Ford, two of Northup's owners, are recognizable from the churches, the cemeteries, and the family names of people in the area. Some Louisianans viewed the film, and the brutality toward blacks depicted in it, as an attack on their families. The Daily Mail found one of slave owner William Prince Ford's descendants, who called the film ""exaggerated"" and said that during slavery ""I don't think there was widespread brutality."" This is, of course, completely untrue. Ed Baptist, a Civil War historian at Cornell, told me that during slavery the ""evidence shows that torture was widespread"" and ""the records of enslavers consistently report whippings. Ads for runaways mention scars, again and again."" When I visited the sites from 12 Years a Slave with White and the BBC, it was clear that Louisiana needed to confront not just its dark past, but also its present. As I pulled up to the site of the Ford Plantation a few miles outside Cheneyville, White called me, saying, ""Get here now, there's a noose in a tree!"" This noose was only a hundred feet from where Northup had been enslaved, a hundred feet from where Northup was hanged and nearly killed by a white carpenter with whom he'd had a disagreement. (Northup lived only because his owner owed a mortgage on him.) It was only a hundred feet from a place where hundreds of blacks had been enslaved, whipped, beaten, raped, had their families ripped apart, and been murdered. There were still nooses in the trees, and they weren't relics left over from the antebellum. They were a clear signal: Blacks aren't welcome near this property. These attitudes reverberate in our politics and our justice system. Sen. Mary Landrieu lost re-election in December because she was linked deeply to President Obama. The New York Times interviewed local Louisianans, including one who accused Landrieu of creating ""an environment where 'everything catered to the black.' "" Landrieu, with a bit of understatement, summed up the opposition toward the president, and by extension herself, by saying, ""The South has not always been the friendliest place for African-Americans."" Landrieu came under fire immediately. Gov. Bobby Jindal accused her of ""living in a different century."" But, when it comes to race, Louisiana is nowhere near the 21st century. David Duke, the KKK leader, was a Louisiana state representative who ran for governor in 1991 and beat out the sitting Republican governor, Buddy Roemer, in the primary. (This election is one more reason why I struggle to believe that Scalise was unaware of Duke's or EURO's views--Duke praised Scalise, and suggested it wouldn't have been surprising for Scalise to speak at one of his events, saying, ""I had a huge amount of Republican support."") My freshman year of high school in 2007, my classmates and I wore black to protest the treatment of the Jena 6. After constant racial provocation in this small North Louisiana town, including white students hanging nooses from the ""white tree"" after black students sat under it, a fight put a white kid in the hospital.  The black students were charged with attempted second-degree murder. When Scalise showed up at the EURO workshop in 2002, he was a small-fry Louisiana state representative looking for political support, and it worked. A couple of years later, Stormfront members were still recommending voting for Scalise for Congress because he had shown ""support for issues that are of concern to us."" Over the years, Scalise has been a reliable voice on these issues, from being one of only six votes in the Louisiana House in 2004 against making Martin Luther King Jr. Day a state holiday to saying he wouldn't rule out impeaching President Obama. Most trees in Louisiana don't have nooses in them, but there are enough racists, who are still voting, that politicians cater to them."

19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/nypd_killings_new_york_city_s_largest_police_union_thinks_it_s_under_attack.html	"This past Saturday afternoon, two New York City police officers were gunned down in cold blood while they sat in their squad car outside a Brooklyn housing project. Within hours, the head of the city's largest police union declared whom was to blame for the terrible tragedy: Mayor Bill de Blasio. Standing outside the hospital where the slain officers were taken, Patrick Lynch, the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, declared that there was ""blood on many hands tonight"" but that it ""starts on the steps of City Hall, in the office of the mayor."" Those jarring comments followed the extraordinary decision by Lynch and many officers to literally turn their backs on the mayor as he entered the hospital. Taken in tandem, those actions cemented the perception that de Blasio's support for those protesting the chokehold death of Eric Garner had created a rift between the mayor and his city's police force, one that Saturday's slayings of officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos had potentially made insurmountable. But that's an oversimplification of a story that's been unfolding since long before Garner's killing. The reality is that de Blasio and the union have been at odds since he campaigned for mayor last year on the promise to upend the city's law enforcement status quo, including overhauling Mayor Michael Bloomberg's stop-and-frisk program--a vow that de Blasio largely kept once in office. The police union, meanwhile, has a long history of taking public stands against New York City mayors, including law-and-order types Bloomberg and Rudy Giuliani. The relationship between de Blasio and the cops wasn't soured solely due to the mayor's response to Garner's death and the subsequent protests. The mayor and the NYPD were never going to get along, no matter what. Devoid of that context, Lynch's remarks this weekend sounded like a rare, raw moment of candor unleashed in the heat of the moment. In reality, this was simply the latest, loudest attempt to discredit de Blasio. Lynch's ongoing efforts to undermine the mayor were caught on tape eight days earlier at a closed-door union meeting. ""If they're not going to support us when we need 'em,"" Lynch said, according to a recording of his remarks obtained by Capital New York, ""we'll embarrass them when we can."" Given the chance Saturday, Lynch did just that. The tension between City Hall and the police union predates de Blasio by at least two decades. As former New York Times reporter David Firestone has noted, Lynch and the PBA attacked de Blasio's three predecessors almost as vociferously. It may have seemed extraordinary when, earlier this month, the union began asking officers to sign a letter requesting that de Blasio not attend their funerals in the event they are killed in the line of duty. The union, though, tried a similar move in 1997, during Giuliani's tenure. The biggest difference between now and then isn't what the police union--and Lynch specifically, who's been president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association for 15 years--is saying. It's that the killing of Garner and the murder of two police officers have put the strained relationship between the mayor and the NYPD in the national spotlight. While the union's anger with de Blasio began with his opposition to stop-and-frisk, it has grown to include a whole lot more--everything from his support for police retraining and body cameras, to the fact that his wife's chief of staff is in a relationship with a convicted felon who once mocked police as ""pigs"" on social media. The mayor's decision, in the wake of the Garner grand jury verdict, to describe how he instructed his biracial son to ""take special care"" when interacting with cops was the culmination of months of tension, but hardly the spark that started the current fight. It's not fair to say that this is all just rhetoric. There is obviously a real divide between this specific mayor and his police force. Many of the NYPD's rank-and-file clearly feel betrayed by the mayor's decision to have a public conversation about police reforms that the officers think should happen in private, if it happens at all. It is also clear, though, that the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association is a group that is constantly aggrieved, taking offense at slights both real and imagined. In 1992, when David Dinkins was in office, the PBA staged a rally of thousands of officers, who blocked traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge to protest the mayor's plan to create a civilian group to look into police misconduct. ""He never supports us on anything,"" an officer told the New York Times. ""A cop shoots someone with a gun who's a drug dealer, and he goes and visits the family."" Sound familiar? Underlying the tension this time around are ongoing, heated contract negotiations between the union and City Hall. That's not to suggest that this current fight is all--or even mostly--about money. But like any employee, an officer who's unhappy with the size of his paycheck will see it as an indication that he's unappreciated. Toss in overblown union rhetoric about being ""thrown under the bus"" by the mayor, and that unease will fester. It's hard to tell how many NYPD officers agree with Lynch's inflammatory rhetoric, but the perception that de Blasio hates cops has now become reality in many quarters. The last thing New York City needs right now, with citizens still angry about Garner's death and two cops having been murdered in cold blood, is a police force that is at odds with the municipal government. But given the history of New York's police union, it's naive to expect we're going to see anything else."	New York City's Largest Police Union Hates De Blasio, Just Like It's Hated Every Other Mayor
20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/barack_obama_s_final_2014_press_conference_the_president_appears_to_be_enjoying.html	"President Obama has a more than 11-hour flight ahead of him to Hawaii, but at his press conference on Friday it felt like he was already on vacation. He was loose as he joked with a Politico reporter about the magazine's new Brussels' bureau, admitted to another he'd forgotten the back half of her list of questions, and even interrupted his remarks to say ""bless you"" to someone who sneezed. Before leaving the podium he offered the traditional Hawaiian Christmas salutation (Bing Crosby earworm available here). But if it seemed like he might let slip the cocktail umbrella up his sleeve into a fruity drink, Obama was more serious about the messages he was sending to everyone from the North Korean dictator to Sony executives and the network television bosses who wouldn't air his address about immigration last month. In November, President Obama's party took a pounding at the polls. In the press conference the day after, Obama avoided offering a word or descriptive phrase to encapsulate the catastrophe. (It's something he and past presidents have often done in the wake of a drubbing.) He then sort of refused to take the loss, reminding the world that he too had a constituency: the voters who elected him and re-elected him, a larger group than had just handed Republicans control of the Senate. In the 40 days between that press conference and the one he gave Friday, the president has worked that same seam--unburdened and loose from having no more elections to face. First, he announced his support for strong net neutrality, then he announced a climate deal with China--secret and long in the making--that helped jump-start progress in global talks, then he issued the executive order protecting as many as 5 million undocumented immigrants. After that came an EPA ruling on ozone emissions, a budget deal to keep the government open, and the historic deal opening diplomatic relations with Cuba. This press conference was an exclamation point on this dash in his presidency. Obama clearly seemed pleased with the way things have been going. He said he still remained open to working with Republicans, and he said nothing ill of them. His goal next year, he said, was to separate those things that he and Republicans agree on (tax reform, infrastructure improvements, and trade) from those things they will fight passionately over (everything else). 2015 is going to be an exciting year, with Republicans anxious to show they can govern and the president anxious to show he's still got more punch. Obama did have a little chin music for network television executives whose representatives he didn't call on during the 45-minute event. He only called on female correspondents, in another sign that in ways big and small he's going to do things his way. The president said he thought Sony executives had made a mistake removing The Interview from theaters. ""That's not who we are,"" he said. In fact, Obama had a lot to say about who we are. Asked about race relations in America, he expanded his remarks to talk about the general resilience and goodness of the American people. It was his own long-standing paean to American Exceptionalism, though his critics say he is only capable of running down the country. ""The vast majority of people are just trying to do the right thing. People are basically good and have good intentions,"" he said. He said his general theme for the end of the year was, ""We've gone through difficult times. ... But through persistent effort and faith in the American people, things get better. The economy has gotten better. Our ability to generate clean energy has gotten better. We know more about how to educate our kids. We solve problems. Ebola is a real crisis. You get a mistake in the first case because it's not something that's been seen before. We fix it. You have some unaccompanied children who spike at a border. And it may not get fixed in the time frame of the news cycle, but it gets fixed. And, you know, part of what I hope, as we reflect on the new year, this should generate is some confidence. America knows how to solve problems. And when we work together, we can't be stopped."" The president said next year will be the fourth quarter of his presidency. An exciting time, he said. Perhaps that will be true if he's got surprises like the ones he unveiled in the past 40 days--the deals with China and Cuba were covert operations. But presidencies aren't like sporting events. Every morning after the final election of a second term, the valet will lay out the lame-duck suit on his chair. The president has vigorously resisted it so far. He will need to rest up on vacation because it will be waiting for him when he returns."	The Past 40 Days Have Probably Been Obama's Best

North Korea is blackmailing the U.S. entertainment industry, the pope is secretly brokering rapprochements between the United States and the Castros, and politicians are stepping forward to enter the race to be the next leader of the free world. You might think that is enough to permanently sideline the national conversation about Benghazi. It isn't. Though it's been a comparatively lean year for Benghazi news, a core group of right-leaning activists--who seem to represent a sizable chunk of the Republican base--is pushing for a maximally aggressive House investigation into the attacks, and they have an enormous slough of unanswered questions. Either way, the Benghazi lull won't last long. In his opening statement at the Dec. 10 House Benghazi committee hearing, Rep. Trey Gowdy, who chairs it, said the committee will have more hearings in January, February, and March. This may seem odd. It's been more than two years since the attacks on the Benghazi consulate that left four Americans dead, and in that time, five congressional committees and the State Department's Accountability Review Board have all released reports on the attack and its causes. But for the most dogged Benghazi theorizers, there are always more questions. Conservatives' interest in the Benghazi story varies widely. Heritage Foundation scholar James Carafano (who testified before Congress two months after the attacks) speaks to the concerns of many Republicans--and even a few Democrats. During that testimony, in 2012, Carafano focused on what the attacks can teach us about potential security vulnerabilities at other U.S. outposts. ""For me, it's always been about understanding why the system failed--because I don't think anybody would argue that the system worked--so we can make sure these are things that are not repeated,"" he tells me. ""Somebody's going to come back and attack an embassy again,"" he says. ""That's just a given. That's going to happen. That's what these guys do, when they put something in their playbook they don't let it go."" Carafano argues that it's unclear if the White House has improved its disaster management and crisis communications since the 2012 attacks. Plus, our military's shrinking footprint in the Middle East and North Africa could make diplomatic outposts more vulnerable than they were two years ago. Carafano adds that he sees minimal political upside for Republicans in the investigation, at least when it comes to going after Hillary Clinton. That's one perspective from the right. But, as followers of the #TCOT hashtag may suspect, it's not the only one. The Benghazi Accountability Coalition is a group focused on pushing for continued investigations of the attacks. Its members include Allen West, former congressional candidate Dan Bongino, Frank Gaffney--famous for charging that Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood--and Ginni Thomas, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas's wife, as well as Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. According to a statement released on the eve of the Dec. 10 Benghazi hearing, they are unimpressed with the select committee's progress thus far. After half a dozen investigations, they still have lots of questions. Where was President Obama on the night of the attacks? (Marc Thiessen at the Washington Post wants to know this, too.) They're also unsatisfied with the explanation of the genesis of the YouTube talking points--on the Sunday shows after the attack, then-U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice said the attack was the result of a video that had been posted online, which was false--and they're totally unsatisfied with the House Intelligence Committee's report, for a panoply of reasons that have found minimal credence in the mainstream press. And there's the theory--promoted by WorldNetDaily, TownHall, and others--that the CIA was using the Benghazi consulate as an outpost in a gun-running operation for getting weapons to Syrian rebels. The most relevant explanation may be the political one. Fitton, whose group has worked extensively to uncover White House communications regarding the attack through Freedom of Information Act requests, says Republicans owe their control of the Senate to Benghazi. ""Next year the new Republican Senate ought to have a moment of silence for the memories of the four men who in many ways gave them control of the Senate because of the people's reaction to the disclosures, and the disgust at the president's lies about that attack,"" he says. Fitton cites a poll his organization commissioned with Breitbart from the Polling Co. asking midterm voters if news about the attacks influenced their votes. Thirty-nine percent of respondents said that a revelation about the way the Obama administration characterized the attacks ""IS RELEVANT AND HAS AN EFFECT ON VOTE."" The poll has some methodological issues, and its wording of the Benghazi question is suspect, but it still gives Fitton and his allies ammo to direct at Hill Republicans. Fitton says he's underwhelmed by the work of the select committee thus far. ""We're hopeful that there's something being done behind the scenes,"" he says, ""but it's disappointing to see that the members behind the issue aren't out there highlighting the questions that need to be answered."" This puts Gowdy in a tricky place. He's promised more hearings and a lengthy investigation, and he's won Internet devotion for his viral-video-friendly cross-examinations of witnesses in committee hearings. But there's seemingly insatiable grassroots interest in the attacks and, in some quarters, an endless appetite for the newest and darkest conspiracy theories. It seems incredibly unlikely that Gowdy will run an investigation that satisfies the Benghazi Accountability Coalition and its sympathizers. And after so many other investigations, nobody else seems interested."	Why Some Republicans Are Still Chasing Benghazi
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/gun_rights_why_americans_cling_to_the_second_amendment_but_are_ok_with_torture.html	"During the past few months, America has made a number of statements about how it balances safety and security risks against the rights guaranteed in the Constitution. To review: -Our movie theaters (Regal Entertainment Group, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., Cinemark Holdings Inc., and Carmike Cinemas Inc.) and movie studios (Sony in the case of The Interview, Paramount in the case of Team America: World Police) are afraid enough of a dubious threat of violence by North Korea that they're voluntarily giving up their own First Amendment right to freedom of speech. -A majority of respondents to a Washington Post/ABC  survey are afraid enough of the threat of ""terrorism"" that they're willing to ignore the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of torture. Fifty-nine percent of those polled said the CIA's treatment of post-9/11 terrorism suspects, as documented in the newly released Senate Intelligence Committee report, was justified. Though the Post/ABC poll left it up to respondents to decide whether the CIA's treatment constituted torture, 50 percent of Americans in a 2013 Associated Press-NORC poll said that ""torture"" of suspected terrorists could ""sometimes or often"" be justified. -A large majority of respondents to several polls in October were afraid enough of the possibility of contracting Ebola that they supported mandatory quarantines for anyone returning to the United States from a country suffering an Ebola outbreak--an approach that, given the lack of medical justification for isolating an individual who isn't showing Ebola symptoms, would seem to violate the Fifth Amendment's guarantee that Americans can't be deprived of their liberty without due process.* In our willingness to make the United States a less free society in order to protect ourselves, there is one notable outlier: the case of the Second Amendment. In fact, a Dec. 10 Pew survey found that, for the first time ever, more people in the United States believe it's important to ""protect the right of Americans to own guns"" than to ""control gun ownership."" Despite what could fairly be described, by developed-world standards, as an epidemic of gun violence--at least 30,000 people are killed by guns in our country each year, in situations ranging from suicide to domestic disputes to mass shootings--Americans continue to prioritize gun rights. Even in the aftermath of Sandy Hook, Congress declined to pass legislation requiring that private sellers conduct background checks on gun buyers, a rule that would likely increase public safety without ultimately infringing on regular citizens' right to bear arms. When it comes to guns--but not free speech, due process, or the rights of criminal suspects--Americans' commitment to individual freedoms overrides their fear of violence and/or death. What's with this contradiction? I can make sure I follow traffic laws and stay alert on the road, but there's nothing I can do when turbulence hits besides trust the pilot, so flying is scarier even though I might know the fatality stats in the abstract. I can shoot an intruder with my own gun, but if I'm unarmed because of gun control laws and someone breaks into my house, there's nothing I can do besides trust the police to react quickly (and trust that the government has been successful in keeping a gun out of the intruder's hands as well), so gun control is scary even though I might know in the abstract that murders are rare in countries with heavy restrictions on firearm ownership. The through-line in America's collective attitude toward constitutional rights isn't principle--it's the impulse to respond proactively to fear. In a world of endless real and perceived threats, owning a gun is a tangible action I can take to protect myself from them--just like torture, quarantines, and the suppression of Seth Rogen's penis joke movie. *Correction, Dec. 19, 2014: The piece originally misstated that the Sixth Amendment guarantees due process. The Fifth Amendment does. (Return.)"	The One Constitutional Right Americans Aren't Willing to Sacrifice for Safety and Security
23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/why_selma_matters_today_what_the_film_can_teach_activists_against_police.html	"To win reform, you can't just protest. You need a strategy. And specifically, you need to give your opponents--and your reluctant allies--a way to say ""yes."" In Selma, an evocative look at Martin Luther King Jr. and his fight for a voting rights bill, director Ava DuVernay shows just how this looks. King has an agenda. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 ended the formal structures of Jim Crow, but its institutional support remained. In much of the South, blacks were still disenfranchised, blocked from voter registration with poll taxes, grandfather clauses, and elaborate registration tests. (Here's an example from Louisiana.) Despite contempt from elected political officials and violence from elected sheriffs, blacks couldn't hold them accountable. It also meant they couldn't sit on juries, not only denying a chance at community participation, but also precluding fair trials for black defendants and protecting white offenders who targeted blacks from the judgments of black citizens. Consider, for instance, that both the Scottsboro Boys and the killers of Emmett Till faced all-white juries. For the former, it was a literal death sentence. For the latter, it was acquittal. In real life, activists from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or SNCC, began organizing with local civil rights leaders in early 1963. For more than a year, facing arrests, beatings, and intimidation from Alabama Sheriff Jim Clark and other police officers, they worked to desegregate public places and register blacks to vote. Unfortunately, these efforts ended after an injunction from a local judge barred group gatherings under the sponsorship of SNCC and other civil rights groups. The film begins after this, in early 1965, with King prepping his campaign for voting rights. He appeals to President Lyndon Johnson, who declines to move with legislation, prompting the turn to Selma, Alabama, and the start of the registration campaign, which provokes the racist rage of local authorities, all aided by Gov. George Wallace. King and allies know that white leaders in Selma will respond to their campaign with violence. It's, as they discuss, one reason they chose the location. But their goal isn't to convince them, or to appeal to any other white leaders in Alabama. No, the point of the marches--including the one that would enter historical memory as ""Bloody Sunday""--was to galvanize public opinion and bring to it to bear on President Johnson, with a message. As long as you don't work toward a solution--as long as you don't bring voting rights legislation to Congress--we will march, and you will deal with the political fallout of brutal state violence against American citizens. In other words, King is raising awareness and trying to create a specific outcome through particular pressure points. But Johnson has agency. If he doesn't want to have to deal with the images of Selma--tear gas, racist cops, and dead volunteers--then all he has to do is say ""yes."" I watched Selma last week, at a special screening. A few days later, I went to Freedom Plaza in downtown Washington, D.C., to watch and photograph the ""Justice for All"" march, organized by Al Sharpton's National Action Network, or NAN, and meant to protest police violence against black Americans. Compared with its counterpart in New York, Sharpton's march wasn't large--about 10,000 people, versus 50,000 up north--but it was still remarkable, a diverse collection of people from across the country, united in the belief that ""black lives matter."" Not to say that there weren't any problems. There was a moment, early in the event, when long-burning tension between Sharpton and the newer, younger activists flared into the open. At the focal point of the gathering were speakers, many with connections to Sharpton and the NAN. The younger activists were disgusted, angry with Sharpton and convinced that this was a march for his aggrandizement, not a protest for justice and radical change. Some took to the stage to demand the microphone, and one woman--Johnetta Elzie, who said she was tear-gassed while protesting in Ferguson--gave a sharp critique. ""This movement was started by the young people. We started this. It should be young people all over this stage. It should be young people all up here."" The mic was cut, and the activists folded back into the crowd. The march began, with thousands listening to Sharpton and other approved voices. It's noteworthy that Selma had a similar--if quieter--moment between SNCC representatives James Forman and John Lewis and the on-site leadership of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, including King. Forman, in particular, was frustrated with King's attempt to claim leadership and displace SNCC activities. King's argument--the reason he thought he was right to take control--was that he and the SCLC had a record of getting results. And while they didn't have the grassroots connections of the SNCC activists, they knew how to channel anger into action and action into accomplishment. With his checkered past and mixed history of practical and political success, Sharpton can't make this argument, or at least, it would be hard. At the same time, you can credit Sharpton for his commitment to this traditional approach of outside activism and inside baseball. For all of his faults, he understands that change requires partners, and while he isn't a compelling figure to young activists, he has knowledge worth knowing. There's no doubt that this is a vital moment. With protests across the country and endorsements from major figures in American society, ""Black Lives Matter"" might be the most significant youth movement in recent history. But right now--and not unlike its contemporary, Occupy Wall Street--it reads as just an exercise in catharsis, a declaration of dignity and a plea for humanity. This isn't a bad thing, but it isn't a strategy. Not only could ""Black Lives Matter"" shift attitudes on criminal justice and force a needed conversation about police culture and police violence, it could create political space for changes to law and policy. Indeed, if we want reform, it must. In other words, as it builds grassroots power, this movement also needs to build an agenda. And regardless of what it includes, it needs to give the other side--the side with institutional power--a way to say ""yes."" That may not end in radical change--few things do--but it's a start, and that can't be overrated."	"What ""Black Lives Matter"" Could Learn From Selma"
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/jeb_bush_preparing_to_run_for_president_in_2016_his_first_campaign_moves.html	"Jeb Bush doesn't like process stories, the kinds of stories that focus on how candidates are running their campaigns or positioning themselves relative to other candidates. He wants to be an ideas guy. His political adviser Mike Murphy hates process stories, too. They are both right. Stories about the nuts and bolts of running campaigns outweigh by a vast margin the stories about whether the person running for office has the right skills, values, and character for the office. We should never mistake a candidate's talent as a campaigner for telling us all we need to know about whether he can hack it as a president. But stories on the inner workings of campaigns aren't entirely without value. When Newt Gingrich's campaign staff deserted him in the middle of the race, the reasons for the mass exodus told us something about the limits of Gingrich's creative, messy mind. Plus, Bush is almost taunting us to write about process. He wants us to take cues about his facility with modernity because he was an early adopter of email and wants us to divine meaning about his commitment to transparency by releasing 250,000 email messages from his time as governor. He has talked a lot about how he will run his campaign differently than past Republicans, wriggling free of the crazy primary purity tests that have undone others. He is running as a disruptive force in the GOP primary as a way to show us how he might be a disruptive force for good in politics. (Pardon the use of that awful piece of jargon, but it fits here; I will pay jargon offsets by reciting a sonnet to schoolchildren.) Jeb Bush hasn't run a competitive campaign in 12 years--not since his re-election as governor of Florida in 2002. He should be rusty and slow-moving. But how he's gone about taking this first step to run for the presidency may tell us something about what kind of fellow he is and give us the first clue about what his instincts might be in office, should he get there. In the last few weeks he has been brisk in reacting to evolving political events, and he has done so while keeping the campaign on his terms. Before the flurry of recent Bush stories reporting on his announcement, he had little control over what was being written about him. A lot of the stories speculated about whether he would run. In a party where voters want action, he was looking a little like the GOP's Hamlet. Mitt Romney's supporters were actively working to diminish Bush's stature in the press. A Bloomberg Businessweek story about his investments took center stage for a few days. He was getting the Hillary Clinton Treatment--the experience of having everyone else define the candidate without any input from the candidate. By speeding up his rollout, Bush took control of his story. By releasing 250,000 emails from his time as governor, he will make an attempt to start a conversation about leadership, policy, and results. When the emails are published, this gambit may fail as badly as Clinton's attempt to define herself with her book, but reacting and adapting to a changing landscape are useful skills for a candidate and a president. They wouldn't necessarily be expected from a candidate who has been out of the game so long. Bush also faces a unique management challenge: There are a lot of people in Bushworld. (Every candidate has this problem to some degree, but the Bush family is the largest political dynasty in America, so it also comes with the most advisers, consultants, and ""friends."") Some members of Bushworld have ties to his father, and some of them have ties to his brother. All of them could appear in news articles as ""sources close to Bush"" or ""friend of the Bush family"" or ""Bush adviser,"" and they will then be quoted saying any old things they like. Twitter will take it from there, and Jeb Bush's actual team will spend the rest of the day tamping down the flames. That's a management challenge for Bush and whoever is piloting his campaign, making sure that the fellow who has promised to run a revolutionary campaign isn't blown off course by people pretending to speak for him. The only politician with a comparable problem is Clinton, who must keep tight reins on Hillaryworld (and a man named Bill). Still, politics has gotten a lot uglier since Bush last ran; he's said he's very aware of that. The first real test will be whether he has the right temperament for a modern campaign. He's taken stands on immigration, taxes, and Common Core that will excite frustrating attacks. Low-rent jibes about his father and brother will mushroom (and those punches have irritated him in the past). He has now gone from the comfortable recline of being a GOP wise man to a position in which he will face the equivalent of the most irritating person he can imagine having license to poke him in the forehead from sun up till sun down. Is he ready for that? He has been working out and appears to have lost some weight, but has he also been listening to some Jon Kabat-Zinn recordings? If not, those who look out for him should use one-click ordering and next-day delivery to stock his playlist. How he handles the madness of the campaign in this silly twilight period will set the first impressions voters and GOP donors have of him as a candidate, and it will tell us something about his ability to handle the pressures of the office that are only slightly more rational than the presidential campaign. He'll also have to get used to one more irritating part of the campaign cycle: more process stories (like this one). He's invited them."	Is Jeb Bush Ready to Run?
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/why_americans_support_torture_we_accept_the_abuse_and_cruel_punishment_of.html	"Are we living in Dick Cheney's America? All of the numbers say yes. First, there's the new poll from ABC News and the Washington Post, which finds a large and supportive majority for torture. Not only do 59 percent of Americans say the torture of suspected terrorists was justified, but 58 percent say torture is often or sometimes justified, as a general matter. We get a similar picture from the Pew Research Center, which published a torture poll on Monday. According to Pew, 51 percent say the CIA's ""interrogation"" methods were justified, with a sharp partisan divide between Republicans who overwhelmingly agree the CIA was justified (76 percent), and Democrats who are less sure (37 percent). Finally, there's a CBS News poll that finds wide agreement on the nature of torture and only slight disagreement on whether it's justified. Large majorities of Americans believe CIA techniques were torture: 73 percent for sexual threats, 70 percent for forced sleeplessness, 69 percent for waterboarding, and 57 percent for ice water baths. Nonetheless, a near-majority--49 percent--say the torture was justified to obtain information and prevent terrorist attacks. (That torture failed to yield valuable secrets from the enemy wasn't mentioned.) The bottom line is that--13 years after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001--most Americans think torture is a reasonable tool for fighting terrorism. Part of this is partisanship--most Republicans support torture and believe it's justified--part of it is pop culture--which, with few exceptions, treats torture as a powerful tool for catching ""bad guys""--and part of it is just who we are. Americans like punishment. Not only do we have the world's highest incarceration rate--716 inmates for every 100,000 people, compared to 475 for every 100,000 in Russia and 121 for every 100,000 in China--but we also have among the most draconian punishments of any nation in the developed world. ""In the United States,"" notes a report on sentencing from the University of San Francisco, ""people who are found in possession of drugs, a non-violent offense, can be sentenced to die behind bars."" They can get life sentences for minor offenses and face decades in prison for a host of nonviolent crimes. But here's what's key: It's not just that Americans want a system that metes out punishment, it's that--despite our Eighth Amendment--we are accepting of the cruelest punishment. And while it's not legal, it exists and it's pervasive. In theory, our prisons are holding cells for the worst offenders and centers for rehabilitation for the others. Inmates can work, learn, and prepare themselves for a more productive life in society. In reality, they are hellscapes of rape, abuse, and violence from gangs and guards. At the for-profit East Mississippi Correctional Facility, for example, prisoners lacked functioning toilets and were forced to ""defecate into Styrofoam trays or plastic trash bags"" without any way of ""ridding their cells of the waste other than tossing it onto the housing unit through the slots in their doors."" Mentally ill prisoners were left to their own devices, with terrible consequences. ""Prisoners engage in gross acts of self-mutilation, including electrocution, swallowing shards of glass and razors, and tearing into their flesh with sharp objects."" These kinds of stories aren't hard to find. Nor is evidence of our epidemic of prison sexual assault. ""Roughly 200,000 men, women, and children reported being sexually abused in detention facilities in 2011, the most recent year for which the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) has anonymously self-reported data from inmates,"" writes Carla Murphy for Colorlines. Because of shame from the assault and fear of their assailants, the actual number is almost certainly higher, as many victims don't report their abuse to the authorities, in part because guards are often as responsible for rape as other inmates. Americans know this. They know that prisons are horrible. They know that going to jail vastly increases your odds of being raped, attacked, or worse. And yet, this does nothing to shift the overwhelming punitiveness of American public opinion. Indeed, prison rape is a punch line, summed up in don't drop the soap or watch out, you might become a punk. Americans don't recoil from assaults in our jails and prisons; they welcome them as deserts for people who commit crimes. Our prisons, then, are sites for retribution. As Robert A. Ferguson, professor of law and literature at Columbia University, notes in his book Inferno: An Anatomy of American Punishment, Americans routinely transition from a rational view of criminals (""because your act and your mental state at the time were blameworthy, you deserve punishment"") to a moralized one (""you have a hardened, abandoned and malignant heart"" and ""you are evil and rotten to the core""), to a scornful one, where the criminal is ""scum"" and deserves ""whatever cruel indignity I choose to inflict on you."" You see this most vividly in the reactions to police shootings of black Americans. It's not enough for the shooting to be justified, as a grand jury decided in the case of Ferguson's Officer Darren Wilson. No, the victim must be demonized, hence the chorus of critics against Michael Brown: He was a thug who deserved his fate. If this is how we treat domestic prisoners--who, despite their crimes, are still citizens--then it's no shock we torture noncitizen detainees, and it's no surprise Americans largely support the abuse. After all, these are suspected terrorists. They're presumptively guilty, and they deserve their fates. And if they're innocent--if they've been swept up or sold out--then next time we'll have to be more careful, even though we don't plan to take any steps to avoid making the same mistake again. Toward the end of his Meet the Press interview with Cheney, host Chuck Todd tried to make a final point against the former vice president's pro-torture triumphalism. ""Is there a reason these interrogations didn't happen on U.S. soil?"" he asked. ""Was there concern that maybe these folks would get legal protections from the United States and that's why it was done at black sites?"" ""We didn't read them their Miranda rights either,"" replied Cheney. ""These are not American citizens. They are unlawful combatants. They are terrorists."" This was the nut, the belief at the center of his crusade. To Cheney, what we did--the beatings and the rape and the murder--doesn't matter. What matters is that these were ""terrorists"" and they deserved it. We aren't living in ""Dick Cheney's America"" as much as Dick Cheney is just living in America and thinking like an American. Here, we already believe our criminals deserve the brutality of our prisons. From there, it's easy to think that our detainees deserve the depravity of our dungeons. That's where he stands, and we stand with him."	Why It's Not Surprising That Americans Support Torture
26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/jeb_bush_to_release_250_000_email_messages_why_he_may_redefine_how_republicans.html	"Jeb Bush announced this weekend that he is releasing 250,000 emails from his two terms as Florida's governor. North Korean hackers may be dismayed that he beat them to it, but Bush 2016 boosters are happy. This move, along with a planned e-book incorporating the emails, was taken as the surest sign yet that he is planning a presidential run in 2016. ""It has been kind of fun to go back and to think about this,"" Bush told Glenna Milberg, a Florida TV reporter, ""and remind myself that if you run with big ideas and then you're true to those ideas, and get a chance to serve and implement them and do it with passion and conviction, you can move the needle. And that's what we need right now in America."" That sure sounds like a man who is running, which may also change the calculus of others who are thinking about a run. Mitt Romney left the impression recently with one of his backers I talked to that he would not consider another run if Bush entered the race. And if Bush weren't preparing for a run, why would he go through this massive email dump? It'd be like taking your rental car to the shop to get it detailed. (Update, Dec. 16, 10 a.m.: And sure enough, two days later, Bush announced on his Facebook page that he will actively explore a run for the presidency.) Bush has said that if he runs for president, he will do it differently than past candidates. ""Lose the primary to win the general,"" is how he described his mindset in a recent interview.* That's actually a temporal impossibility--losing teams don't get to compete in the Super Bowl--but for Bush it is shorthand for approaching the Republican primary differently. In essence, he may run the risk of doing things that are usually considered destructive in the GOP primary, but that he envisions will be so effective that he not only wins the primary but also emerges stronger for the general election. The early release of such a large email trove is the first test of that proposition. It's laudable, political, and risky. Bush is dropping a candor bomb that all voters of any party should applaud. Presidential campaigns have seen a vast drop in planned candor over the years. Candidates are terrified that the few interesting words that fall out of their mouths will appear on video somewhere or will be tweeted out of context. So their campaigns desperately try to keep them from ever saying any of them. They certainly don't want a lot of easy access to emails that might show what candidates look like when they have their guards down. As voters though, we should encourage this kind of candor. It tells us something about how candidates work, how their ideas are formed, and how they operate in their actual jobs. That is a window into the attributes they'll actually bring in office. So much of what gets discussed in presidential campaigns is not that. Given this level of candor, though, it will also be a test of the Bush gambit: Will voters and the press read these emails in context, or will they single out a line in the 250,000 messages to define Bush out of all proportion and reason? The political benefit to the release is that Bush gets to remind everyone of his time as governor and write his own story. It's more creative than the usual route candidates take, which is to write a campaign biography. Such books, in keeping with the trend toward eliminating all candor, are produced with ever greater precision at passing through the mind of the reading public without leaving a single impression. This week, Joshua Green and Miles Weiss's Businessweek story about Bush's private investments and business practices has raised the question about whether he has a ""Romney problem,"" meaning whether his private business interests will come to define him and offer vulnerabilities his opponents might exploit. He may face these issues; we'll see. One way to combat such a problem is to create a large enough narrative about who you are that voters are attracted to that, rather than repelled by whatever mean things your opponent says about your business career. If he pulls it off, this email surge will be partially responsible. This data release is also a statement about the values he would bring to the presidency. ""I think part of serving or running, both of them, is transparency--to be totally transparent,"" he said. ""So I'll let people make up their mind. There's some funny ones, there's some sad ones, there's some serious ones."" That's also a challenge to his opponents. Think of the trouble Govs. Chris Christie and Scott Walker have gotten into over emails and texts. Assuming Bush doesn't have any bombshells, he can present his administration as drama-free and effective. Disclosure also sets up a favorable contrast to the Clinton operation, which is known as tightly closed. Of course, this surprise move could backfire terribly. Once a candidate starts being candid about things, the press and public want more of it. Tax returns for the last 15 years? Business records? Business emails? The distinction between what he releases and what he doesn't can quickly devolve into a debate that detracts from the solutions-oriented campaign he wants to run. Bush could still decide not to enter the race. He hasn't done anything yet in furtherance of a presidential exploration that would hurt himself personally--turning down business opportunities, lucrative speeches, and stepping down from boards. When he makes a genuine financial or personal sacrifice, that's when we'll know he's passed the point of no return. But if this is the first step in his 2016 campaign, he has already defined it as a different one. Correction, Dec. 16, 2014: This article originally misquoted Jeb Bush's description of his mindset if he were to run for president as ""lose the general to win the primary."" Bush described it as ""lose the primary to win the general."" (Return.)"	Jeb Bush Wants You to Read His Email
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/dick_cheney_defends_cia_s_torture_republicans_angry_at_obama_s_executive.html	"On Sunday, while the world still reeled from the revelations of the Senate torture report, Dick Cheney took a victory tour. Uncowed by the criticism and denunciations, the former vice president used NBC's Meet the Press to defend and praise the CIA's torture program. ""Waterboarding, the way we did it, was, in fact, not torture,"" he said, rebuffing host Chuck Todd, who tried (and failed) to get Cheney to acknowledge the findings of the report. ""Now when you're dealing with terrorists, the likes of al-Qaida or the ISIS, I haven't seen them waterboard anybody. What they did is cut their heads off."" This was the vice president's whole approach. For him, what is torture depends on who is the torturer. If it's an enemy of the United States, it's torture. If it's an American, it's not. And so, when faced with waterboarding or medicalized rape (""rectal feeding""), Cheney can comfortably say the United States didn't torture. Not that he cares if we did. ""I have no problem as long as we achieve our objective,"" he said. ""I was prepared and we did. We got authorizing from the president and authorization from the Justice Department to go forward with the program. It worked. It worked now for 13 years."" To Cheney, the morality of torture--of rendition and indefinite detention--doesn't matter. When Todd asked about Gul Rahman--who was kidnapped, chained to his cell, doused with water, and left to freeze to death--Cheney all but shrugged. ""The problem I had is with the folks that we did release that end up back on the battlefield,"" he said. ""I'm more concerned with bad guys who got out and released than I am with a few that, in fact, were innocent."" Cheney is unapologetic. ""There's no pardon needed,"" he said when asked if President Obama should pardon the CIA agents involved. ""No crime was committed."" If raping prisoners is what it takes to stop a terrorist attack, Cheney will make it happen. And if beating them to death is how we respond to being attacked, then he'll do that too. Like Raskolnikov, he rejects conventional morality. But unlike Fyodor Dostoyevsky's famed protagonist, he isn't driven to despair by his depravity. Instead, he is unrepentant, assured of his righteousness as a Great Man of History, unbound by the ethics of ordinary people. If given a second chance, he would ""do it again"": lie to the public, break the law, and violate the Constitution. And so, it seems, would other Republicans. ""The fact that the CIA's Detention and Interrogation program developed significant intelligence that helped us identify and capture important [al-Qaida] terrorists, disrupt their ongoing plotting, and take down [Osama Bin Laden] is incontrovertible. Claims included in this report that assert the contrary are simply wrong,"" said incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in a statement. And this followed supportive rhetoric from Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, and a host of Fox News hosts. ""Cheneyism"" is the GOP mainstream, and given wide support from self-identified Republicans--more than 70 percent of Republicans say torture ""can sometimes or often be justified""--it might stand as a new litmus test for GOP presidential candidates in 2016. It's worth a moment to cut from the particular issue of torture and the Republican Party to an establishing shot of the present political landscape. Last month Washington was consumed with arguments over President Obama's ""Caesarism,"" all prompted by his plan to shield millions of unauthorized immigrants from deportation using executive authority. To lawyers on both sides, this lived within the limits of presidential power. ""While we differ among ourselves on many issues relating to presidential power and immigration policy, we are all of the view that these actions are lawful"", wrote a group of 10 prominent legal scholars, including Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe and Slate contributor and University of Chicago Law School professor Eric Posner. ""They are exercises of prosecutorial discretion that are consistent with governing law and with the policies that Congress has expressed in the statutes that it has enacted."" In other words, you don't need a novel or convoluted reading of the law to make the immigration order a legal exercise of presidential authority. But legal consensus couldn't contain conservative anger. ""There was a time when our 44th president claimed to stand for transparency, modesty, moderation, tolerance, humility, reason, and calm,"" wrote Charles C.W. Cooke for National Review. ""Today ... he will don the robes of the emperor and spin minor discretion into gargantuan usurpation, all norms and touchstones be damned."" For conservative columnist George F. Will, Obama was ""dismissive of the federal government's Madisonian architecture"" and guilty of ""institutional vandalism."" There is no doubt conservatives are sincere. Immigration policy views aside, there are legitimate worries with Obama's use of executive discretion. There are norms when it comes to presidential policymaking, and while Obama's actions are legal, that doesn't mean they are wise as a matter of constitutional upkeep. Still, if the immigration action is Caesarism--if, as Sen. Cruz has said, it's the action of an ""unaccountable monarch""--then the same is surely true of the torture program. In reality, it's not even a comparison. On one hand, you have discretion for some unauthorized immigrants, rooted in congressional statutes. On the other, you have a secret and illegal program of kidnapping and torture, justified by wild claims of executive authority and defended in the name of ""security."" Barack Obama used his office to help illegal immigrants, and for this, Republicans have attacked him as a Caesar. That's fine. But Dick Cheney used his office to claim dominion over the bodies and persons of alleged enemies, some of whom were innocent. If that isn't Caesarism, if that isn't despotism, then it's something scarily close. But here, with few exceptions, Republicans are silent."	If Republicans Think Obama Is a Monarch, Why Are They OK With Cheney Being a Despot?
28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/psychologists_role_in_the_cia_s_torture_why_these_medical_professionals.html	"Thanks to revelations in the newly released report from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, it is now widely known that the CIA's torture program was created, supervised, and implemented by two licensed clinical psychologists--James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen--who were paid millions of dollars for their efforts. Less widely known is that the Bush administration's torture operation, at both the CIA and the Pentagon--at ""black sites"" and at Guantanamo--was devised and supervised largely by clinical psychologists. These psychologists used their knowledge of the workings of the human mind and psychological ""mind-control"" research to induce ""learned helplessness"" and ""debility, dependency, and dread,"" aiming to destroy the minds of detainees in the hope that ""actionable intelligence"" and ""critical threat information"" could be sifted from the wreckage. The psychologists were vital to the torture program for one additional reason: The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel had determined that the presence of psychologists and physicians, monitoring the state and condition of the prisoner being tortured, afforded protection for the CIA leadership and the Bush administration from liability and potential prosecution for the torture. Later, the OLC applied the same rules to the Defense Department's ""enhanced interrogation program,"" which, according to an investigation by the Senate Armed Services Committee, was created and overseen by a team led by a clinical psychologist, and eventually overseen exclusively by clinical psychologists. But this scandal has not been fully exposed, nor is it over. It turns out that for psychologists to be able to do the Bush administration's bidding and oversee the torture of detainees, they required not only indemnification for legal liability (Mitchell and Jessen were promised a $5 million legal defense fund by the CIA), but they also required indemnification from another source--a higher authority, if you will. Medical professionals are beholden to their respective professional ethics codes. The psychologists involved in the ""enhanced interrogation techniques""--what most of us call torture--were concerned about being brought up on charges of ethics violations. If found guilty of ethical violations, these psychologists could lose their licenses and, according to CIA and Defense Department regulations, they could lose their positions and potential for future professional work. The same applies today, as monitoring remains an essential component of the Obama administration's adherence to the new Army Field Manual, with its own set of ""enhanced interrogation techniques."" Recent revelations in James Risen's new book, Pay Any Price: Greed, Power, and Endless War, add an additional dimension to this story--it appears that senior staff members of the American Psychological Association, the world's largest association of psychologists, colluded with national security psychologists from the CIA, the Pentagon, and the White House to adapt APA ethics policy to suit the needs of the psychologist-interrogators. Now, the APA, under enormous pressure because of the allegations reported by Risen, has agreed to an independent investigation to be conducted by David Hoffman, a former inspector general and federal prosecutor. It will in all likelihood provide a rare opportunity to look inside the secret world of APA-counterintelligence collusion. Risen based his allegations on emails found on the personal computer of Scott Gerwehr, a researcher at the Rand Corp. and apparent CIA consultant, who died in a motorcycle accident in 2008. Gerwehr had established close ongoing collaboration with a group of ""national security psychologists who had influence behind the scenes at key institutions throughout Washington."" Among them were Susan Brandon, behavioral science adviser at the Bush White House (she is now chief interrogation scientist for the Obama administration) and Kirk Hubbard, the CIA's chief behavioral scientist. Hubbard has publicly admitted to bringing Mitchell and Jessen into the CIA to design the agency's ""enhanced interrogation"" program. Brandon, Hubbard, Gerwehr, and Geoff Mumford, APA's director of science policy, had worked together since soon after the 9/11 attacks to bring psychologist-researchers together with psychologist-operatives to collaborate on issues related to national security interrogations and interrogations research. Mitchell and Jessen were among the operatives present at these invitation-only meetings. In July 2004, months before the role of psychologists in torture was made public when a report from the International Committee of the Red Cross on Guantanamo was leaked to the New York Times, Hubbard, Gerwehr, and personnel from the CIA and Pentagon were invited by Mumford and APA's ethics director Stephen Behnke to a secret meeting. Publicly the APA has claimed at various points that the meeting was to address challenges faced by domestic law enforcement investigations. However, the true goal of the meeting, according to the emails obtained by Risen, was to ""bring together people with an interest in national-security"" interrogations and to ""ask individuals involved in the work what the salient issues"" were and to ""provide guidance"" for the ethical issues that may come up with regard to those interrogations--the very interrogations so nauseatingly described in the Senate report. We might divine some of the immediate motivation for convening this meeting from information released this week in the Senate committee's report. The report cites a CIA inspector general review, dated May 7, 2004, in which CIA psychologists were raising ethical questions about the way Mitchell and Jessen were conducting their interrogations: ""Psychologists objected to the use of on-site psychologists as interrogators and raised conflict of interest and ethical concerns."" The questions were reportedly ""based on a concern that the on-site psychologists who were administering the [CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques] participated in the evaluations, assessing the effectiveness and impact of the [CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques] on the detainees."" Could it be that these were the same fears that had prompted Hubbard, Mumford, and Behnke to brainstorm on APA ethics and national security? As a direct result of this secret meeting, Mumford and Behnke proposed the creation of an APA task force to determine APA's ethics policy on psychologists' participation in national security interrogations. The task force met in June 2005 and decided that ""it is consistent with the APA Ethics Code for psychologists to serve in consultative roles to interrogation and information-gathering processes for national security-related purposes."" In this conclusion, the APA stood alone among health professions. The other major national organizations of physicians, psychiatrists, and nurses all determined that their ethical obligations prohibited their members from participating in these interrogations. But the APA concluded that it was not only ethical for psychologists to participate, the leadership claimed that psychologists were necessary to keep national security interrogations ""safe, legal, ethical, and effective,"" roles that the other health professions determined were conflicting, unethical, and impossible to perform responsibly. APA members have long suspected that the creation of the task force was a predetermined rubber stamp for CIA and Defense Department policy because a majority of its members were drawn from CIA and Pentagon units directly involved in national-security interrogations or interrogation research. But there was only circumstantial evidence that its members had been chosen for what appeared to be a CIA- and Defense Department-determined fait accompli. With the publication of the Gerwehr emails, however, Risen has provided the smoking gun. It is undoubtedly this email exchange, from APA's Mumford to CIA's Hubbard that pressed the APA into agreeing to an independent investigation: On July 5, 2005--the day the task force released its report, Mumford sent Hubbard a copy of the report and wrote: ""I also wanted to semi-publicly acknowledge your personal contribution ... in getting this effort off the ground. ... Your views were well represented by very carefully selected task force members."" He went on to reveal that Susan Brandon had served as an ""observer"" at the task force meeting (the observers' names had not been made public) and ""helped craft some language related to research"" for the task force report. And then, Risen provides one additional bombshell--at the time of Mumford's thank-you letter, Hubbard had retired from the CIA and was working directly for Mitchell Jessen and Associates, the company created in 2005 by the two psychologists specifically for the purpose of conducting their work with the CIA. Between 2005 and 2009, their firm collected $81 million from the CIA. Since its release, members of the APA have fought to rescind the task force report and keep psychologists out of national security interrogations. But every time a policy is proposed or passed, the APA leadership has found a way to subvert its intent. In 2008, a group of APA members appealed to the entire membership in a referendum to prohibit psychologists from participating in any operation that violates the Geneva Conventions or the United Nations Convention Against Torture. The referendum passed overwhelmingly and in February 2009 was made APA official policy by the member-run council. Yet to date, APA leadership refuses to implement the referendum, claiming the APA cannot determine when U.S. national security policy violates international law; the APA holds to this position even in the face of judgments rendered by the United Nations Committee Against Torture, for example, as to the illegal status of indefinite detentions at Guantanamo Bay. We await the results of the independent investigation. In the meantime, there are three questions Americans and the profession of psychology must answer together. Why did the APA devote its resources to guarantee psychologists' presence in these criminal operations? How did the U.S. government permit this weaponization of psychology? And how can we hold the psychologists who apparently created, justified, supervised, and implemented torture, and the professional association that seems to have supported those psychologists, to account?"	Why There Would Have Been No Torture Without the Psychologists
29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/tea_party_democrats_does_president_obama_have_a_rebellion_brewing_among.html	"What if Democrats had their own Tea Party-esque rebellion? It might sound far-fetched, but it's less so after this past week. On Thursday, House Democrats revolted against the president, decided to fight a largely unwinnable battle because of their principles, and even stomped their feet a little bit. All of a sudden, a wing of the president's party appears to be hyperprincipled, unpredictable, and eager to buck leadership. If this is a trend instead of a blip--and some top House Democrats say it's a trend--then the president may have more in common with House Speaker John Boehner than he realized. At hand were two provisions added to a last-minute, must-pass government-funding bill that would prevent a shutdown. Democrats were comfortable with the 1,603-page legislation except for two late-breaking provisions: one that would change the Dodd-Frank bank regulation bill, and one that would let donors give more cash to national political parties. Things started looking tricky for the president when Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a liberal Massachusetts Democrat who's made battling Wall Street her signature issue, came out vocally against the bill. Among a powerful sector of Hill Democrats, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, this consensus emerged: The bill as it stood--with the Dodd-Frank and campaign finance changes--wasn't just unsupportable, it was immoral. And then, the political bedfellows started to get strange. Those Democrats quickly found themselves on the same side of a contentious vote as Tea Party Republicans (though conservatives' opposition was largely due to the legislation's funding of the president's immigration move). Meanwhile, President Obama and Boehner--both of whom supported the CRomnibus bill that would fund the government, among other things--found themselves staring down unruly caucuses that were willing to ignore their pleas, cast aspersions on their integrity, stand defiantly on populist principles, and vote just like they damn well pleased. The shift became blatant during a lengthy meeting that House Democrats held in the basement of the Capitol before the vote. The president's chief of staff, Denis McDonough, swung by the meeting to try to convince attendees to vote for the spending bill despite the provisions they found onerous. He left looking blanched and chagrined (though, to be fair, he might always look like that) and wouldn't give the reporters who swarmed after him any details on how the meeting went. But some of the Democrats who trickled out after him were happy to mouth off. When reporters asked Democratic New Jersey Rep. Bill Pascrell if McDonough's pitch had persuaded many Democrats to change their minds, his response was emphatic. ""Absolutely not."" Oregon Rep. Peter DeFazio called both provisions of the funding bill ""unbelievably odious"" and said the chief of staff's pitch was ""somewhat tepidly received."" Then he made a point Democrats would make over and over throughout the night, and one that's straight from the Tea Party playbook: Democrats need to stand (and, specifically, to vote) on principle, even if those votes are doomed on the Hill, so they can win elections. If they don't vote their principles on economically populist issues like Wall Street and campaign finance, DeFazio argued, they can expect to see repeats of the 2014 midterms for the indefinite future. That is not the rhetoric of a group of representatives who feel like they need to compromise and ""show they can govern."" That's the talk of angry backbenchers who feel betrayed by party leadership. Tea Partiers make a parallel argument, charging that Republicans' repeated nominations of moderates like John McCain and Mitt Romney cost them electoral victories. Californian Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman was channeling Tea Party energy Thursday night. ""You don't want to talk to me,"" he said when I first approached him as he emerged from the meeting. ""I'm just a foot soldier."" But after being pressed, he said he doubted McDonough's pitch had much sway. ""I'm walking out of this caucus meeting feeling very proud of my caucus, because there was moral clarity, there was conviction,"" he continued. ""I had a feeling a few moments ago that we stood for something. I hope it holds."" Pick an issue like immigration or deficit spending, and a Tea Partier might say the exact same words. But this revolt wasn't just unruly backbenchers; outgoing Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Steve Israel was also impassioned and unequivocal in his opposition. ""These are core Democratic principles and values,"" he said. ""That's why we're here, and we ought to keep fighting on those values."" ""We've got to draw a line in the sand for the middle class and for working families,"" he added. Illinois Rep. Jan Schakowsky, a staunch Pelosi ally, emerged from the meeting excited. ""People were inspired to dig deep and to make very passionate speeches,"" she said. She said that Rep. John Lewis, the Georgia Democrat and civil rights icon, argued passionately for fighting the bill. There was lots of cheering, she said. ""It was kind of like church,"" she added. It wasn't enough, however. Fifty-seven Democrats voted for the CRomnibus--largely due to the president's lobbying in its favor--and it passed 219-206. But the revolt still matters. Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking member on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said the intra-caucus fight signals that House Democrats will be more assertive on these issues in the future, even if it means bucking the White House. He argued that Democrats struggled to turn out their base voters this cycle because they hadn't been principled enough. ""People have to feel that you are fighting for them,"" he said shortly after the vote. ""Basically you can buy a district, easily, if you've got the money,"" he continued. ""That's not what the Founding Fathers were all about. So sometimes you just have to stand up and fight. Our constituents want us to fight."" Invoking the founders, bucking party leadership, and arguing that we've got to ""stand up and fight""--for Tea Party activists, that will sound extremely familiar. ""I do expect to see, in the future, these kinds of fights,"" he concluded. ""And I think they'll be even tougher."""	Will the Democrats Have Their Own Tea Party Rebellion?
