Terry McAuliffe was the most venal politician among Virginia Democrats. But, I was wrong. That title goes to state Sen. Phillip Puckett, who resigned on Monday as part of a deal to give Republicans control of the state Senate, and thus a full veto on the Medicaid expansion. You can get the full story from the Washington Post. The short version is this: For the last five months, Gov. McAuliffe and state Democrats have been fighting to expand Medicaid through the budget process. Despite its even split of 20 Democrats and 20 Republicans, the Senate made its move, passing a budget with the Medicaid expansion earlier this year. But, with its large Republican majority, the House of Delegates refused to budge, and has passed a budget without the expansion. McAuliffe is willing to compromise--he's offered a market-based solution for expanding Medicaid--but he won't abandon expansion, which was a key promise during his campaign. Likewise, Republicans won't do anything to implement Obamacare or further its goals, which has left Virginia with a stalemate that promises to become a government shutdown after the June 30 deadline for a budget. Which brings us back to Puckett. By resigning, he gives control of the Senate to Republicans, who can then pass a budget without the Medicaid expansion. In turn, McAuliffe is left with a choice: He can sign the budget and break his campaign promise, or he can preside over the first shutdown in Virginia's history. And what does Puckett get in return? A position on the state tobacco commission and a promise to confirm his daughter's nomination to the state judiciary. Because of outrage over the attempted bribe, Puckett won't be taking the job. Even still, he's leaving the Senate and giving Republicans the majority they need to block Obamacare in Virginia. (And it appears his daughter will get her judgeship.) If this were just another round of routine political combat, it would be annoyingly venal--irksome but not consequential. L'affaire Puckett, however, is a big deal. Under the Medicaid expansion, an estimated 400,000 Virginians would get health insurance, as well as access to needed health services like check-ups, medicines, surgeries, and cancer treatments. It's no exaggeration to say that there's a health access crisis in Virginia, which Medicaid could ameliorate, if not solve altogether. And Puckett isn't some bystander to these problems. The former state senator represented the 38th District, which draws from 10 counties in southwestern Virginia: Tazewell, Pulaski, Russell, Buchanan, Dickenson, Wise, Radford, Bland, Smyth, and Norton. This is one of the poorest corners of the state. The poverty rate in Russell County, for instance, is 20.4 percent, compared to 11 percent for the state writ large. Even worse is Buchanan County, where 25 percent of residents live below the poverty line. Not only is it one of the poorest counties in Virginia, it's one of the most impoverished in the entire United States. And according to a recent analysis from the Commonwealth Institute, it contains a chunk of the estimated 20,170 uninsured adults in Puckett's district who are eligible for coverage under the Medicaid expansion. Puckett didn't just sell out his Democratic colleagues, he sold out thousands of his constituents--indifferent to their health and well-being--for little more than some cheap nepotism. No, the Republicans he helped aren't much better; they would rather wage an ideological crusade against Obama than aid the voters who support them. Still, say what you will about right-wing extremism, at least it's an ethos. And given the choice, I would rather have an opponent with conviction than an ally who couldn't be bothered to care.

Of course, that's nonsense. Morgan Freeman is just an actor, which is to say, he's just a person. And, it turns out, he's a person with dubious views on income inequality. On Tuesday, in an interview with CNN's Don Lemon, he touched on the recent political attention to inequality. First, he said, he thinks it's a ""great idea"" that President Obama has focused on inequality. ""We have a much more vibrant society when we don't have such a vast chasm between the haves and the have-nots,"" he said. He continued, ""Without a middle class, you're not going to have consumers."" At this point, Lemon asked a follow-up question: Do you think race has anything to do with inequality? ""Today?"" Freeman answered. ""No. ... You and I, we're proof."" ""Why would race have anything to do with it?"" he added. ""Put your mind to what you want to do and go for that. It's kind of like religion to me--it's a good excuse for not getting there."" After a few more questions from Lemon, Freeman finished with a final thought. ""Making [race] a bigger issue than it needs to be is the problem here."" Again, coming from Freeman--with his authoritative voice--this sounds correct. But it's painfully wrong. Yes, the gap between rich and poor is wider than it's been since before the Great Depression, and yes, the top 1 percent of all households command more than a third of U.S. wealth. At the same time, there are huge racial disparities within the overall wealth gap. In a recent study, researchers at the Center for Global Policy Solutions found that ""Whites have a median net worth over 15 times that of Blacks ($111,740 vs. $7,113), and over 13 times that of Latinos ($111,740 vs. $8,113)."" It's true that there's always been severe gaps between black and white Americans. Even during the economic expansion of the 1990s, joblessness among blacks was twice as high as it was among whites. Still, after five years of recession, mass unemployment, and sluggish growth, the wealth gap between blacks and whites is wider now than it's ever been. According to the Pew Research Center, the difference in wealth between black and white households increased from $75,224 in 1984 to $84,959 in 2011. And a 2012 census analysis found that the gap nearly doubled during the recession, with white households at 22 times the wealth of their black counterparts. It's not an exaggeration to say that the housing collapse all but destroyed the wealth accumulated by black Americans over the last five decades. Notwithstanding Freeman, there's no understanding income inequality--or the disparities in criminal justice, education, health care, and unemployment--without a firm grasp of race, or rather, the economic consequences of past and current racism. Of course, we can forgive Freeman for his naive belief that individual achievement is evidence of a level racial playing field. It's harder to excuse President Obama, who--in a speech on inequality last year--disavowed the idea that race is an especially salient dimension of disadvantage. ""The opportunity gap in America is now as much about class as it is about race,"" he said. ""So if we're going to take on growing inequality and try to improve upward mobility for all people, we've got to move beyond the false notion that this is an issue exclusively of minority concern."" But this is belied by everything we know about class status for blacks and whites. Even when they earn middle-class incomes, black Americans live in dramatically poorer neighborhoods than their white counterparts. And in turn, downward mobility is a greater risk for middle-class blacks in a way that isn't true for whites of the same station. To return to a point I've made before, the economic difference in upbringing between most black children and most white children is so great as to escape comparison. Or, as sociologist Mary Pattillo writes, ""even the most affluent blacks are not able to escape from crime, for they reside in communities as crime-prone as those housing the poorest whites."" My hunch is that Obama knows this, hence a program like My Brother's Keeper, which puts its focus on young black men. Indeed, in his speech announcing the initiative, he said as much. ""[T]he plain fact is there are some Americans who, in the aggregate, are consistently doing worse in our society--groups that have had the odds stacked against them in unique ways that require unique solutions."" He continued, ""[B]y almost every measure, the group that is facing some of the most severe challenges in the 21st century in this country are boys and young men of color."" I would amend this to include young women of color, but otherwise, he's right. And, as we craft policy to ameliorate these problems, we should keep his point in mind. If the goal is success, then the fight against inequality--and more broadly, the fight for opportunity--has to consider race. There's no other choice--despite what some actors will tell you."

For more foreign correspondence mixed with food, war, travel, and photography, visit their online magazine or follow @roadskingdoms on Twitter. RANIA, Iraq--In 1977, after the Iraqi army first attacked his home village of Gullan in the Kurdish north, Askendar Mohammed went to live deep in the mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan, where he served as a peshmerga--a term used to describe Kurdish fighters, meaning ""those who confront death."" He fought for more than two decades, even as Saddam Hussein dropped chemical weapons on Kurdish towns and villages, murdering thousands. An uprising in 1991 ultimately failed to depose Hussein. But after U.S. forces set up a no-fly zone over much of the north, Iraqi Kurdistan began to wrest itself from decades of fighting and move toward autonomy. For his valor in the uprising, Mohammed was elected the mukhtar, or village head, of Gullan, and gradually memories of war became eclipsed by promises of wealth and independence. Today, Mohammed, the aging peshmerga, has settled into a new life of calm; the shotgun tucked into his pants is more an accessory than a tool of the trade. But underwriting Iraqi Kurdistan's bright future is oil--an estimated 45 billion barrels are waiting to be exploited in the most secure part of the world's fifth-largest oil economy, much of it in the mountainous regions around Gullan. The village's peshmerga are revered and laid-back in their retirement, but since last summer Gullan has faced a new adversary, one for which decades of firing Kalashnikovs in the mountains hadn't prepared the fighters. Exxon Mobil won the contract from the Kurdistan Regional Government to explore near Gullan, and the oil behemoth has already begun digging holes in the mountains. The villagers are on edge. In April I traveled to Iraqi Kurdistan for the third annual Gullan festival, a daylong picnic where villagers celebrate Kurdish traditions and village life. During the festival, locals unfurled enormous Kurdish flags over the rocky slopes. On a brilliant green foothill, white pickup trucks came loaded with elaborate picnics that would feed villagers over a day of singing, dancing, and slapstick Kurdish plays that involved a lot of actual cheek-slapping. Mohammed's wife set out aluminum trays of white sheet cake, spread with bright pink frosting, on the picnic blanket where we sat. The festival had been devised by older residents, including Mohammed, who worried that the development of Iraqi Kurdistan might cut off a new generation of Kurds from their history as decisively as war had almost cut off theirs. Exxon's presence in the surrounding hills was a harsh reminder of that. Villagers worried about the impact of an oil windfall--dividing society, replacing local populations with foreign workers, courting war. Although some villagers needed jobs, they weren't optimistic Exxon would provide them. They found no inspiration in a future similar to those of other oil-rich nations. ""Kurds have never benefitted from oil,"" a member of the Gullan village council told me. ""Oil was the cause of problems in other countries. In Iraq and in Kurdistan, the oil has only meant more money for gunpowder."" The villagers' simple lives were hard-fought, and they were not eager to see them disturbed by Exxon. A revolutionary spirit has fueled Kurdish society for so long that, even though that spirit was now mostly symbolic--the peshmerga uniform signifying tradition more than might--the villagers felt defined by it. Even the festival was seen as rebellious. ""Before, if we wanted to have a party like this, we had to hide in the mountains to do it,"" Aisha Hamza, a local mother in her late 40s, told me. ""We saw the war, and now we look around the country and see that it is free. ... We don't want to leave the village, even for a lot of money. We don't need a lot of money."" When I mentioned Exxon, Mohammed was at first sheepish. Initially he had supported the company exploring the area. The possibility of a better life and full independence from Iraq, coupled with a resignation that oil was the only means to both, had led Mohammed to sign a document allowing Exxon to conduct seismic tests in the area. But so many villagers ended up opposing the move that, by April, Mohammed had firmly changed his mind. He began to talk about Exxon in the proud, threatening terms of a Kurdish peshmerga: ""The uprising started here,"" he said, sweeping his hands toward the mountains. ""Ali Nabi""--the uprising's first victim, and a symbol of Kurdish rebelliousness--""a very strong peshmerga, was from near here. Once people know that this is the kind of man who came from our villages, they will be scared."" The people of Gullan decided they would resist Exxon, but not with the guerilla tactics they used to fight Hussein's army. The threat of Big Oil warranted a new form of combat, more dissent and civil resistance than brute force. Last summer Gullan residents, along with a network of area villagers led by the newly formed Assembly for the Protection of the Environment and Public Rights, greeted Exxon trucks with placards denouncing the project. Villagers, numbering about 200, according to one group member, threw logs into the road to block the oil company's trucks. They objected for environmental and social reasons. They tried to be part of the process. ""We went to talk to the oil company,"" Dara Ibrahim, a 25-year-old founding member of the environmental group, told me. ""We asked if a member of our group could go with the oil company. They said absolutely not."" Ibrahim was dressed in a crisp, pinstriped version of traditional Kurdish clothing; he sat straight and spoke gravely. He felt insulted by Exxon, which he thought assumed that the villagers, including the environmental group, would be ignorant of both their rights and the potential impact of drilling for oil. Ibrahim, like many of his neighbors, has a university degree. Other villagers have recently returned from abroad, where they were asylum seekers; along with them comes expertise, perspective, and, often, money. ""One of our members is an engineer,"" Ibrahim told me. ""The company knew that if he worked with them, he would understand what is going on."" (An Exxon representative, writing via email, assured me that the company goes through a ""lengthy process of talking with local communities to understand their needs and share information."") Gullan is not the first Kurdish village to express frustration with a foreign oil company, but here, a fatalism that had characterized previous operations gave way to action. Locals told me they had learned from the experience of other villages, where promises of employment and wealth had been broken or proved impossible to fulfill due to budget disputes with Baghdad. For years Kurds had been told that oil was the key to their future, but in many oil-rich areas, that future remained bleak. Sometimes, as with the oft-repeated claim that seismic testing would cut off the village's water supply, the grievances veered toward nervous gossip (which, critics say, was stoked by politics). In 2009 Greg Muttitt, the author of Fuel on the Fire: Oil and Politics in Occupied Iraq, visited a town near Duhok, where locals were grappling with Hunt Oil. ""It was the beginning of the whole rash of contracts,"" he told me over the phone. ""What I expected to find was some degree of prosperity from the jobs that oil drilling brought. ... What I found was a community completely cut off from the oil field, which was surrounded by rings of security just outside of town. The money wasn't going back into the town at all, and the jobs, for the most part, were going to Iraqis coming from the major cities in Kurdistan."" Muttitt told me that the attitude among locals was ""one of dejection."" They had grown used to profits from business investments in Iraqi Kurdistan going to members of the two major political parties: the Kurdistan Democratic Party, which controls the western areas, and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, in the east, near Iran. ""They had a pretty low view of the government's level of interest in their welfare,"" Muttitt said. ""What was happening on this oil field was fairly consistent."" Gullan was different. There, the misgivings were not easily suppressed by the promises of money or national independence. Villagers' arguments were more philosophical. Oil, they could see, was a curse. Gullan needed to be preserved, not only for its natural beauty but also for its revolutionary history. They felt rich enough. For decades Baghdad had put Iraq's oil wealth toward oppressing the Kurdish minority, and now they felt that their own government was doing the same. An industry analyst based in Erbil, who preferred to remain anonymous, recognized the uniqueness of Gullan's protest. ""They would rather leave it in the natural state, and if they don't share the local benefits, they are fine with that,"" he told me. At the festival, villagers felt wary but triumphant. There had been no underground explosions, and their water supply remained intact. The protests had gotten the attention of the media, and many of the villagers were clearly energized by the new cause. Seismic testing is only one of many preparatory steps in the drilling process, but even those villagers who assumed that Exxon would return celebrated the company's retreat, however temporary. But a ripple of trepidation remained. Mohammed, for instance, was nervous about the document he had signed--and he wasn't alone. Several villagers made nervous references to that agreement in conversations with me. According to Mohammed and other village leaders, Exxon did not leave behind a copy. Other than a vague description of what the document permitted--""They said that they were just here to explore""--the villagers could not recall the exact terms of the agreement. Just two facts are known for sure: The mountains have oil, and Exxon has a contract from the Kurdistan Regional Government. A few days after I visited Gullan, I met with a Kurdish government spokesman, Safeen Dizayee, in Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan. Dizayee was aware of the protests, and understood that many Kurds were unhappy with the impact oil exploration had on their lives. He urged the villagers to be patient. ""Once we start to export oil--with or without an agreement with Baghdad--and we start to really develop, then people will see,"" he said. ""Right now, everything is just rumors."" Like villagers in Gullan, Dizayee spoke in revolutionary terms about independence from Baghdad; even as a high-level government official, Dizayee's own history is one with the rebellious history of Iraqi Kurdistan, and he represents a government headed by revolutionary leaders or their families. It is an irony of the modern struggle for a free Kurdistan that it requires the government to assert its authority over the same villagers, like Mohammed, who fought against Hussein's army in the streets. Those villagers, Dizayee explained, could not determine alone what happens to Gullan. ""With most land contracts, there is no total ownership,"" he told me. ""The state has the right to work on the land."""	The Kurds Who Once Fought Saddam Hussein Are Now Fighting Exxon Mobil	[]	[]

That is the view of some of the smartest, most compassionate people I know, and it explains the new enthusiasm, on the left but also in some quarters on the right, for an unconditional basic income--that is, a cash payment to which all citizens would be entitled, with no strings attached. On the left, the case for an unconditional basic income rests on the notion that low-end service jobs aren't the kind of fulfilling and valuable work that we as a society ought to preserve. By providing everyone with a guaranteed minimum income, the supply of workers willing to do such work will dry up. The poor will be liberated, and free to pursue their deeper desires. On the right, the argument is that a basic income would eliminate the need for armies of caseworkers and other bureaucrats who (supposedly) do little more than meddle in the lives of the poor. Anti-poverty programs like food stamps, Medicaid, and housing vouchers would all be thrown on a bonfire, to be replaced by cold hard cash. No more handholding, say conservatives and libertarians who favor a basic income. If we're going to redistribute, let's do it in the most straightforward way possible. As you've no doubt guessed, I think that no-strings-attached money is a dangerously bad idea and that it will do far more to undermine poverty-fighting efforts than it will to strengthen them. I also think that meddlesome caseworkers are the unsung heroes of the fight against poverty. As of yet, there is no national proposal to greatly increase the flow of no-strings-attached money to poor households in the United States, though the idea has been gaining ground among the pundit class of late, amid fears that robots will soon take all of our jobs. But my hometown, New York City, is on the cusp of a grand experiment to increase the flow of no-strings-attached money to its poor citizens. If past experience is anything to go by, this experiment will end badly. Under Mayors Rudolph Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg, New York City dramatically overhauled its approach to fighting poverty. As Robert Doar, who served as commissioner of the New York City Human Resources Administration under Bloomberg, recounts in a recent article for National Review, the cash-welfare caseload in the five boroughs fell from 1.1 million in 1995 to 347,000 at the end of 2013, when Bloomberg left office. Over the same period, the city experienced a substantial decline in child poverty, from 42 percent in 1994 to 28 percent in 2008 to 32 percent in 2011, as the lingering after-effects of the Great Recession continued to take their toll. The really encouraging news from the Giuliani-Bloomberg era is that work rates also increased. Among single mothers, for example, the work rate went from 43 percent in 1994 to 63 percent in 2009. One of the reasons Doar placed such a heavy emphasis on the importance of work rather than, say, training and education programs is that, as he explains, getting real-world work experience is key to helping welfare recipients not only get but also keep jobs over time. Training and education have a place, but they work best as a complement to on-the-job training rather than as a substitute. But there is a new sheriff in town. New York City's new mayor, Bill de Blasio, has installed Steve Banks as Doar's successor, and Banks, as Heather Mac Donald of City Journal reports, takes a very different approach. Banks and de Blasio are firm believers in training and education programs, and they've announced their intention to ease the enforcement of work requirements. They will no longer require that food-stamp applicants provide proof of their housing expenses, nor will they ask able-bodied adults without children to look for work in exchange for food stamps. Is this a badly needed correction from the bad old days of Bloomberg? It is important to understand that, for better or for worse, the Bloomberg administration was very accommodating when working poor applicants sought to enroll in the food stamp and Medicaid programs. A big part of the reason was simply that the city government didn't set the eligibility rules for these programs, and the federal and state governments had grown more permissive over time. But it also reflected a public philosophy that the billionaire mayor was never very good at articulating--that those who can work and choose not to do so are different from those who do not. This is a distinction that advocates of an unconditional basic income see as pernicious and that those who want to ease up on work requirements see as needlessly punitive. But it is a distinction that makes eminent public policy sense. The welfare reformers of the 1980s and 1990s didn't call for work requirements because they wanted to punish the poor. They did so because of mounting evidence that worklessness in high-poverty neighborhoods contributed to the entrenchment of poverty and to the social isolation of those living in welfare-dependent households. Drawing welfare recipients into the workforce was seen as the best way to get them on the ladder to upward mobility. Despite massive shifts in the economy that have been particularly hard on less-skilled adults, work requirements have been a success by and large. Meanwhile, experiments conducted in the 1960s and 1970s by the federal government found that a no-strings-attached basic income reduced work effort and encouraged marital breakup. Given what we've learned about the consequences of family breakdown for children, and particularly for male children, in the years since, this is nothing to scoff at. Moreover, whatever their practical effects, work requirements are central to the moral legitimacy of poverty-fighting efforts in the United States. In her essay on ""Rethinking Welfare Rights,"" Amy Wax, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, identified a deep-seated, widely held set of beliefs among Americans about welfare. While most Americans accept the idea that we as a society have a shared responsibility for the well-being of the poor, they also differentiate between those who deserve help and those who don't. Those who deserve help are those who make an effort to support themselves and their families to the extent they can. Many people simply can't earn enough to support themselves by dint of disability, limited skills, or a lack of the community ties that enable one to identify and pursue economic opportunities. And so the role of government, according to Wax, is to help close the gap between what people can earn by doing their best to provide for themselves and what they need to lead decent lives. This gap is real, and there is a distinct possibility that it will grow as our economy and society continue to evolve. To protect programs that close this gap, and to grow them if necessary, it is vitally important that welfare disbursements are perceived as fair. In the long run, those who choose to work will not support welfare programs that appear to offer a better deal to those who do not, nor should they be expected to do so. The failure to enforce work requirements thus undermines the legitimacy of welfare, and it endangers the good that welfare can do. This notion of ""conditional reciprocity"" is particularly important in diverse societies. A number of scholars, including the economists Edward Glaeser and Alberto Alesina, have found that more diverse societies are less likely to support high levels of social spending than more homogeneous societies. But more recently, Bo Rothstein, a Swedish political scientist and defender of the welfare state, has found that what really undermines social solidarity and social trust is not diversity per se, but rather the perception that public authorities are corrupt, dishonest, discriminatory, and partial as opposed to clean, impartial, and honest. One of the reasons the Danish welfare state enjoys such widespread support, for instance, isn't just Denmark's famous ethnic homogeneity: It's also that Danish work requirements are extremely strict by international standards, and they've grown tighter over time. Unemployed Danes must demonstrate their ""labor market availability"" by searching for jobs, taking jobs at local job centers, and taking part in so-called activation programs run by hard-nosed caseworkers. The Danish state is indeed generous, but its generosity comes with strings attached, and that's how Danish voters like it. We could learn a thing or two from them. There is far more to say about how we can fix America's social welfare programs. But before we can expand them or shrink them or modernize them, we must first ensure that they rest on a solid moral foundation. And that, ultimately, is what work requirements are all about."

There have been few upsets and few disasters--easy to forget, as the next three weeks will be spent on the GOP's Mississippi runoff agony. Viral videos have seen mostly positive results, lifting Iowa's Joni Ernst to a Senate nomination but failing to elevate Alabama's Obamacare-shooting businessman Will Brooke into a congressional runoff. (This while 2010's viral video star Dale Peterson looked set for a runoff for state auditor.) And what else did we learn? This is no Congress for old men. For all of the bed-wetting and teeth-gnashing about ""Tea Party upsets,"" you can count the number of incumbent Republicans beaten in primaries on two hands. What do they have in common? Well: At the times of their defeat, Rep. Cliff Stearns was 71, Sen. Bob Bennett was 77, Sen. Richard Lugar was 80, and Rep. Ralph Hall was 91. (There are exceptions, like Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who was 53 on primary day but returned to the Senate as a write-in candidate.) Sen. Thad Cochran is only 76, which makes him only the 11th oldest member of the Senate. But he is a whispery, work-not-talk politician who seemed a little confused once national reporters showed up in Mississippi and started asking horse race questions. He avoided debating the much-younger Chris McDaniel, and TV coverage pointed to the reason why, as an affable but raspy Cochran meandered through interviews. On primary night, with more national media in the room than at any Cochran election ever, the senator opted not to give a speech. That detail went into the early political obits, along with the fact that Democrats who voted in their party's primary can't vote in a June 24 Cochran-McDaniel runoff. (Polling suggests Democrats would much prefer to see McDaniel in the general election.) OK already, time to stop viewing elections as ""Tea Party versus establishment."" The Mississippi Senate runoff was a fat wet inkblot on the perfectly polished story most national media were ready to write. The ""establishment"" had defeated the Tea Party.  This was an ""establishment-strikes-back"" kind of year. The Chamber of Commerce had gotten the candidates it wanted; veterans of Mitt Romney's campaign had exorcized the ghost of Todd Akin. This isn't wrong, and absolutely the gubernatorial primary in California and the Senate primaries in Iowa, Montana, and South Dakota ended the way the Chamber of Commerce preferred. That doesn't mean that moderates won. As Ben Jacobs (and not many other national reporters) noticed, Joni Ernst's march to the nomination in Iowa took her through the swamps and marshes of the right (where she was pretty comfortable). She enters a general election as an opponent of the Farm Bill, the Clean Water Act, and the Environmental Protection Agency. A narrative-drunk Businessweek profile of Neel Kashkari portrayed him as a wonky moderate, unlike state Rep. Tim Donnelly, who channeled Republican ""anger about the governor's plan to build a costly, high-speed rail link between the Bay Area and Southern California."" Might be worth mentioning that Kashkari's TV ad-- which apparently won him the race--ended with him literally chopping a toy model of the ""crazy train"" to pieces, with an ax. The ""establishment"" isn't holding on by appealing to the moderate natures of the GOP base. It's joining them on the right. Really, we need to move on from this idea that the Chamber of Commerce, that enemy of EPA rules and the Affordable Care Act and torts, is nudging the GOP toward moderation. Progressives sort of have their act together, at last. For all sorts of structural reasons, the left struggles to drive the Democrats' agenda the way that the right owns the Republicans' strategy. After Montana Sen. Max Baucus resigned for a diplomatic post in Beijing, and Sen. John Walsh was appointed to replace him, former Gov. Brian Schweitzer insisted that a primary between Walsh and progressive Republican-turned-Democrat John Bohlinger was ""too close to call."" It was not. Walsh won by at least 41 points. The left is unlikely to upset an incumbent or ""establishment"" pick this year--see also New Jersey's first congressional district, where party machine candidate Donald Norcross easily won a primary. Yet in races where the establishment was weak, the left found ways to win. In New Jersey's 12th district, safe blue turf, labor and progressive groups backed Bonnie Coleman, who will likely become New Jersey's first black female member of Congress. In Iowa's 1st district, being vacated by Senate candidate Bruce Braley, Democrats nominated a state senator who ran as a ""proven progressive."" And in California (where, if you were curious, Sandra Fluke advanced to a runoff for the state Senate), Democrats avoided some disasters. In 2012, Democrats punched each other out and failed to make the runoff in the 31st district, which they should naturally win. This year, as support for former Blue Dog Rep. Joe Baca flat-lined, Redlands Mayor Pete Aguilar made it into the runoff. In 2012, Democrats accidentally sent a check-bouncing businessman into a runoff with now-Rep. David Valadao. They corrected the mistake this year and advanced Amanda Renteria. And yet ... The Democrats' turnout problem hasn't been fixed yet. Kashkari's primary win in California means the party won't have a statewide candidate embarrassing them down the ballot. (We all remember how a similar situation worked in 2010, when Carl Paladino won the GOP gubernatorial nomination in New York and became a national laughingstock.) That'll inspire a few Republicans who are now in runoffs against incumbent Democrats who failed to win as much of the vote as the combined GOP total in round one--Reps. Ami Bera and Scott Peters. The total Democratic vote in the gubernatorial race, around 56 percent, is less than Barack Obama won in his 2012 re-election campaign. Still, Democrats will be largely OK in California. They might be more nervous in the swing states. In Iowa's 1st District, which should be safe for the party, so far 27,690 ballots have been counted in the Democratic primary. The race for the almost worthless GOP nomination attracted 30,701 votes. Yes, a lot of that can be traced to the competitive Senate primary. But look north to Montana. Sen. Walsh had a more competitive primary than Rep. Steve Daines had for the Republican nod, but the ballots cast: 75,005 for Democrats, 132,224 for Republicans. Compare that to 2006, the year Jon Tester won a competitive Democratic Senate primary that brought out 108,198 voters. Only 97,473 Republicans went to the polls to renominate Sen. Conrad Burns. It's fun, in a small way, this weekly trawling through primary results. But the story of 2014 remains the Democratic turnout gulf. Either the party figures out how to make the electorate look more young and diverse than it typically does in midterms, or it loses."

Let's talk about our children and the elderly. That was the not-so-subtle message the White House delivered to its allies during the rollout of the Environmental Protection Agency's historic new climate initiative. President Obama set the table for reframing the debate Friday when he broke with tradition and left the White House to film his weekly address at the Children's National Medical Center. The backdrop of white lab coats and medical equipment was impossible to miss as the president touted the forthcoming proposal to curb carbon emissions from U.S. power plants. Three days later Obama opted to sit out of the formal unveiling of the draft rule at EPA's headquarters in D.C. on Monday morning, and instead took part in a conference call that afternoon hosted by the American Lung Association. ""This is something that is important for all of us as parents, as grandparents, and as citizens,"" Obama told health professionals and public health advocates on the call. ""As a parent who cares about the health of our families and who also wants to make sure future generations can enjoy this beautiful blue ball in the middle of space we are part of ... I'm asking people to build momentum for these plans."" The think-of-the-children appeal is far from new. Obama and his allies have long warned that the nation must act now for the sake of future generations. The change, however, is that the White House is now doing its best to give the present tense top-billing, a sales pitch that lines up squarely with a recent National Climate Assessment that found that impacts of climate change are already being felt by Americans. The newfound frame was again difficult to miss, when the EPA on Monday released estimates suggesting that the new regulations would prevent up to 4,000 premature deaths and 100,000 asthma attacks in the first year alone, numbers that would climb by about 50 percent by 2030. All told, the rules would mean as many as 2,800 fewer hospital admissions a year for Americans, the agency estimated, and 4,900 fewer missed days of school and work. The public-health pitch involves a bit of sleight of hand, however. Those near-term health benefits aren't directly tied to the carbon emissions that contribute to global warming, but instead would result largely from curbing the release of more conventional pollutants--mercury and sulfur dioxide, among them--that billow out of coal plant smokestacks along with the CO2. But ancillary benefits are still benefits, and the White House has a good reason to hype them given that the legal rationale for the new regulations is rooted in the Clean Air Act, which gave the EPA the authority to regulate pollutants that ""endanger public health and welfare."" The more immediate question: Will the PR plan work? The climate crowd has good reason to believe it will. A 2012 research report from Yale University's Project on Climate Change Communication found that placing the conversation within a public-health frame was more likely ""to elicit emotional reactions consistent with support for climate change mitigation and adaptation"" than a traditional environmental frame, or even one focused on national security. More importantly was whom the health pitch spoke to loudest: Americans who to varying degrees haven't made up their minds about just how pressing a threat man-made climate change is. Yale researchers have identified what they call ""Global Warming's Six Americas."" The six groups run the spectrum from the Alarmed (those who are convinced of the urgent need to fight man-made climate change) to the Dismissive (those who think of global warming as a hoax or conspiracy). There's little need to appeal to either of the groups on the ends--the Alarmed are already on board; the Dismissives never will be--but the middle of the spectrum is up for grabs, the research suggests. It's there where the advocacy battle will be won or lost, and fortunately for the White House it is also there where respondents proved particularly receptive to a health-heavy frame. In hindsight that finding seems almost obvious, says Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale center who was involved in the research. ""No one is out there arguing against better human health,"" he says. ""Conservatives like clean air as much as liberals do, so it's not an issue that forces people into their respective ideological corners."" Still, while recent polls are trending in the climate crowd's favor, it's far too early to declare political victory, and not only because the EPA's draft rules are still years from being enacted. ""The messenger often matters more than the message,"" says Leiserowitz. And right now, the messengers are Obama and his EPA--both of which are familiar targets for climate skeptics and their political allies. ""When we have the medical profession making the case on its own,"" predicts Leiserowitz, ""that's when we'll really start to see the debate change."""

Neutralize the national and focus on the local. Democrats have been getting a lot of practice at the former. On Monday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced new rules limiting emissions at power plants, drawing rebukes and skepticism from Democrats in Alaska, Arkansas, Kentucky, and West Virginia. ""President Obama's new EPA rule is more proof that Washington isn't working for Kentucky,"" Democratic Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes said. ""When I'm in the U.S. Senate, I will fiercely oppose the president's attack on Kentucky's coal industry because protecting our jobs will be my No. 1 priority."" Last week, Democrats in tough races rushed to call for Secretary Eric Shinseki's resignation from the Department of Veterans Affairs. Of the 11 Democratic senators who wanted Shinseki out, eight of them were up for re-election. (In the House, where re-election is every two years, 32 Democrats called for his ouster.) All of this came in a year where vulnerable candidates were working hard to minimize the damage from the president's unpopular health care plan. Imagine being a short-order cook in an earthquake. Every time you try to flip a burger or try to plate a fried egg, the freezer door flies open or the gas line gets knocked out. That's what it's like to be a Democrat running for the Senate this year. When you're trying to keep voters focused on the local race, a national issue intrudes. National trends heading into the 2014 elections are as bad for Democrats as they were before the 2010 election, when Republicans won 63 House seats, six Senate seats, and seven governorships. People think the country is headed in the wrong direction and are not optimistic about the economy, and a majority disapprove of the job the president is doing. In order to combat this sour national picture, Democrats have been following a familiar playbook, trying to show how they can deliver for their voters on the issues that matter most to them while defining their Republican opponents as the people who will harm them on those very same issues. In Louisiana, three-term incumbent Sen. Mary Landrieu has been touting that she is the chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, which puts her in a position to deliver for a state where oil and gas are key to the local economy. In one ad, a Republican shipbuilder says that he supports her because of her committee position. ""It's the most powerful position a person can have when it comes to Louisiana,"" he says in a hard hat, a giant vessel behind him. ""It means more votes, more jobs, and more oil and gas."" She's relied so heavily on her committee post in pictures and advertisements that she ran into trouble for re-enacting a Senate hearing. In addition to delivering pork, Landrieu is emphasizing her local roots, appearing in ads with her father, Moon Landrieu, the former congressman and mayor of New Orleans. In New Hampshire, first-term Sen. Jeanne Shaheen has been touting her local work, too. Her first television ad, run in early May before the VA firestorm, veteran Dwight Clark says that Shaheen ""cut through the red tape"" to help get a clinic open in the city of Keene. In another ad, she touts the work she has done for small business. In Alaska, Sen. Mark Begich emerges from under a snowmobiling helmet to boast about the work he did securing road and bridge permits despite Washington obstacles. The message is that although no one may have faith in Washington, these lawmakers are getting results for their constituents. The problem with this strategy, though, is that when you portray yourself as a unique force able to tame Washington, that story is undermined when you can't do anything to stop Obama from implementing new EPA rules. (Getting the review period extended doesn't really count.) Yes, it's useful for a candidate to find issues where he can distinguish himself from a president, but sometimes the issues are just too big--trying to beat them back takes up oxygen a candidate should be using to sell his best message. Fighting your opponent to a draw on the Affordable Care Act may be a victory of sorts, but it wastes a lot of hours that could be spent talking about the minimum wage, which does more to motivate the voters you need. When Grimes promises to protect Kentucky coal, it's a hard sell. Anyone who really wants the president's policies stopped is going to assume Grimes' opponent, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, is going to have a better shot--particularly if he becomes majority leader--than a freshman Democratic senator. Candidates are also working to make their opponents seem objectionable. One model is Sen. Sherrod Brown's 2012 victory in Ohio. Heavily bombarded with outside money attacking Brown for his support of Obamacare, the one-term senator attacked his opponent early and often, taking some of the focus off himself. In Arkansas, incumbent Sen. Mark Pryor has been hitting Republican Rep. Tom Cotton for voting to raise the age for Medicare eligibility. Outside groups, including the one run by former aides of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, have been steadily blasting Cotton on the Medicare issue. Democratic strategists say that's why, despite Obama's meager 34 percent approval rating in the state and a barrage of attack ads tying Pryor to Obamacare (including another one out Tuesday), Pryor is ahead in the polls. Pryor is popular--he has a 50 percent favorable rating and just a 35 percent unfavorable rating in the latest NBC-Marist poll--while Cotton has a 38 percent favorability rating. This is a version of what Sen. Mark Udall is trying to do to his opponent in Colorado and Democratic Senate candidate Gary Peters is trying to do in Michigan. To win in November, some Democrats are going to have to keep it nasty. Control of the Senate will have a national impact, but the contest isn't a national election. It is a dozen or so statewide races in which local idiosyncrasies can swamp national trends even when those forces seem strongest. National trends can swing House races in battleground districts, but the last several election cycles have shown that Senate races have their own dynamics. The personalities and attributes of the candidates can matter more than anything else. Democrats just have to hope that they have enough time to capture voters' attention and to serve up the local delicacies they've been cooking up between dashes to the fire extinguisher."

7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/06/savannah_river_site_s_mox_project_why_is_the_government_spending_billions.html	"CHARLESTON, South Carolina--Near the center of the Savannah River Site, the federal government's sprawling, 300-square-mile nuclear weapons complex tucked away in a corner of South Carolina, sits an unfinished concrete building. When the government first inked a deal in 1999 to build the so-called MOX facility--a one-of-a-kind plant designed to turn bomb-grade plutonium into commercial nuclear fuel--contractors estimated construction would cost $1.7 billion. Fifteen years later, lawmakers have already sunk more than twice that into the project, and will need to spend at least another $4 billion to finish the job. All told, the government now expects it would cost more than $30 billion to build and operate the plant during its 20-year lifespan--despite mounting concerns the project will fail. So great are the Energy Department's concerns about the ballooning costs and countless delays that the agency wants to halt construction of the MOX facility--probably permanently. But the state of South Carolina won't let the federal spigot turn off. Under threat of a lawsuit from Republican Gov. Nikki Haley, the Obama administration backed away from a temporary shutdown at the end of April. Taxpayer-funded construction is continuing full-speed ahead this summer. Welcome to the world of nuclear-infused pork. The Energy Department's inspector general detailed the project's bloat in a damning audit released last month, which found that construction is already running at least three years behind schedule and at least $3 billion over its most recently inflated budget. Even worse, the report makes it clear that those setbacks were evident before crews broke ground. Prior to green-lighting the project, the department's own independent review found that the design for the facility was so incomplete that it failed to meet established department guidelines necessary for approval. Construction, somehow, began anyway. The federal government is spending $442 million on the project this fiscal year alone, roughly $80 million more than the Energy Department requested. A defense authorization bill currently winding its way through the Senate, meanwhile, calls for $341 million in MOX funding for the upcoming year, $145 million more than President Obama wants. The South Carolina nuclear facility is one of the most expensive non-military projects that the government is building--that almost no one in the government wants. The project is part of an ongoing effort to clean up the radioactive waste of the Cold War. Under a non-proliferation deal brokered with Russia back in 2000, both countries agreed to build MOX plants to dispose of 34 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium by blending it with uranium to create a fuel that scientists believe can safely be burned in commercial nuclear power reactors. In theory, the non-proliferation agreement was a clever one. It aimed to reduce the global stockpile of Cold War nukes and generate low-carbon power in the process. In practice, it has been plagued by ballooning costs, shifting deadlines, and serious doubts whether Moscow will hold up its end of the deal. Things have gotten so bad that President Obama and Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz--who helped broker the original deal during the Clinton administration--are ready to walk away from the billions the government has already sunk into it. In March, the president's budget proposal called for the project to be put on hold while the Energy Department returns to the drawing board. In official reports and in congressional testimony, the Energy Department's inspector general has been raising concerns about the runaway costs and overly optimistic timeline since 2005, two years before workers first broke ground. The Government Accountability Office joined the chorus in 2010. And the Union of Concerned Scientists called for the government to pull the plug back in 2011. Adding to concerns is the fact that no commercial power plant has agreed to burn the fuel in its reactors, something that raises the very real possibility that the government would have to either pay companies to take the fuel off its hands or let it sit on-site unburned. Most troubling, the Center for Public Integrity published a detailed report last summer that raised concerns over whether tweaks to Russia's side of the deal will actually leave Moscow with more--not less--plutonium when all is said and done. And yet the federal cash continues to flow. Last month's audit found that ""the level of effort needed to install equipment was higher than anticipated, staff turnover was greater than expected, and subcontractors experienced problems meeting nuclear quality assurance requirements."" The project has, as the National Nuclear Security Administration's Robert Raines admitted to concerned lawmakers last year, fallen victim to the ""tendency towards optimism"" that plagues many large-scale projects. The NNSA, a semi-autonomous agency within the Energy Department that has jurisdiction over the facility, declined my requests to visit the site and to speak on the record about the project. But I toured the complex in the months before the official groundbreaking in 2007, when such optimism was very much on display. Construction began that summer with the goal of bringing the facility online by fall 2016. Seven years later, the facility is estimated to be only 60 percent complete, and won't be finished until 2019 at the earliest. But even that extended deadline seems unlikely. According to the inspector general's audit, design work is still underway in a whole host of areas, including software, control systems, and fire suppression. NNSA has been unable to confirm if the new 2019 projection is possible, and a review of the new schedule is on hold for at least the next year while the Energy Department weighs its options. The bloated, behind-schedule federal project has one set of vocal defenders: the South Carolina state government. Palmetto State politicians have long deflected criticism of any federal dollar earmarked for the Savannah River Site, and have repeatedly rallied behind the MOX project despite the mounting concerns. After taking a helicopter tour of the site in April, Gov. Nikki Haley told reporters that the ballooning MOX costs are ""not our problem"" but instead a federal issue. ""You've made a very real investment. There is structure and everything there. And now they are just going to walk away from it? It really defies all logic,"" she said. Sen. Lindsey Graham, likewise, has repeatedly called the White House plan to return to the drawing board ""irresponsible"" and ""reckless,"" words the Republican legislator might normally reserve for over-budget federal projects that are taking place outside of his home state. ""There is still a long, arduous fight ahead,"" Graham said in April after the White House temporarily backed down in the face of South Carolina's threatened lawsuit. He went on to vow that he'd use his perch on the powerful Appropriations Committee to ensure that the Energy Department's plan to shutter the facility ""does not become a reality."" History suggests it won't. Correction, June 4, 2014: The caption on the photo at the top of this article originally misstated when the picture of the Savannah River Site construction was taken.

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/06/republican_leadership_conference_gop_rallies_its_supporters_to_defend_the.html	"NEW ORLEANS--The invitations and accolades never stopped arriving for Shaun McCutcheon. In the two months since he won at the Supreme Court--his victory killed the limits on the aggregate amounts that donors can give in a single election--the Alabama businessman had sat for countless interviews. He'd polished off a memoir. He'd gone to Louisville for Sen. Mitch McConnell's primary night party, on the personal invitation of the man who might run the Senate next year. And on Thursday night, the jet-fueled victory lap took McCutcheon to the Republican Leadership Conference. He'd co-sponsored the annual Southern conservative gathering; conference ID badges were emblazoned with his name. After the attendees found their seats, the affable McCutcheon, who constantly looks as if he's just been told a happy secret, learned he would be getting a trophy for his defense of the First Amendment. He ambled onstage, next to David Bossie, president of Citizens United and victor in the Obama era's defining campaign finance case, and was prompted to recap what he'd won. ""Chief Justice John Roberts ruled in my favor,"" said McCutcheon. Hundreds of Republicans roared with applause. ""It was about your right to spend your money on as many parties, candidates, and committees as you choose in this free country,"" said McCutcheon. More applause. ""It's about how those who govern should not be the ones who will govern. It's us the people who should decide."" That got the loudest applause yet. Bossie, who got to sit next to Sen. John McCain during the trial that shredded campaign finance law (""it was a lot of fun""), warned the crowd that Democrats were going to introduce a constitutional amendment to undo that. Hans von Spakovsky, a former Federal Election Commissioner and now a scholar at the Heritage Foundation, warned them that the first Senate hearing on this amendment would come as soon as Tuesday. ""I think it is shocking that almost half of the United States Senate would actually be pushing a constitutional amendment that is basically the 2013 version of the Alien and Sedition Acts,"" von Spakovsky said, referring to the short-lived 1798 laws that banned ""false, scandalous, and malicious"" political writing. ""The intent of it is to silence conservative voices that could prevent them from getting their progressive utopia in the United States,"" he said. It was a little jarring, this insistence that a roomful of people speaking into microphones and being watched by a traveling press corps were at risk of being ""silenced."" The conference's speakers were actually playing catch-up. Ever since the 2010 Citizens United ruling, Democrats have fumbled for a way to combat wealthy Republican donors. In 2010, they attacked third-party spending on elections (especially that of the Chamber of Commerce, which progressives accused of laundering foreign money) and kicked around the DISCLOSE Act, a bill to prevent anonymous donations. None of that worked, but Democrats kept slugging. After 2012, they believed they'd made some Republican donors--the Kochs, namely--suffer a bit for their spending. And they had stacks of polling data revealing that voters preferred limiting money in politics to unfettered, secret donor access. The margin for ""limits"" over ""free speech"" was as high as 3 to 1. In 2013, New Mexico Sen. Tom Udall came up with the amendment that most worried von Spakovsky, one that would give Congress and states power to ""regulate the raising and spending of money and in-kind equivalents."" Udall's amendment has no chance of achieving the two-thirds congressional vote it needs to proceed. Republicans know that. They're approaching it as a teaching moment, a way to inform the base that an attack on donors is an attack on democracy, on them. The Democrats are demonizing job-creators while they're trying to shut up the right. ""Everybody knows about the IRS targeting conservative groups,"" von Spakovsky told me the day after the triumphant panel. ""Every American hates and/or fears the IRS."" The Heritage scholar went a little further. Earlier in the year, he said, he'd joined a debate at Harvard about campaign finance reform. He was supposed to be the heavy, of course. ""I asked all these students in the room: 'How many of you, before you made your decision in 2012, went to the FEC to see who'd given money to the candidates?' "" von Spakovsky remembered. ""Not a single person raised their hand. 'How many of you think it's important to see who gave money?' Not a single hand. Then I asked, 'How many of you know your neighbors can log on to the FEC and see what you gave?' They were shocked. They thought that was a violation of privacy."" All of that colors the conservative reaction to the Udall amendment, but there's more to it. The first night of the RLC closed with a free-association sermon from Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson, whose comments about gays and civil rights to GQ briefly got his show suspended. The network balked only after conservatives, including Sarah Palin, decried the censorship. The specter of a liberal establishment silencing conservatives hovers over every branch of the movement. Social conservatives. Libertarians. Donors. So there'll be no sitting by while the Democrats try to demonize donors or limit what they can spend. ""They're friends of mine, the Koch brothers,"" said Donald Trump after his own novella-length address to the conference. (David Koch has called Trump a ""wonderful guy"" who should never run for office.) ""I don't think that attack resonates. I think one of the mistakes Mitt made was that he didn't want to talk about his success enough. If I were running, I'd be talking about my success."" Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson had actually gotten fairly close to the Kochs, dining with David Koch at the 2012 Republican National Convention and appearing at their donor conferences. ""I think someone like David Koch, who's donated a billion dollars to cancer research, I think someone like Charles Koch and the policies they're primarily promoting, I think they are educating people on the free enterprise system, which just happens to be the best economic system,"" said Johnson after his RLC speech. ""It's the one that's lifted more people out of poverty than any system in the history of the world. From what I know of the Koch brothers, that is what they're trying to promote."" RLC attendees weren't exactly focused on defending the Kochs. There were, arguably, better ways to spend time in New Orleans. But when the topic of campaign finance reform came up, when I'd ask whether there needed to be any donation limits, the sentiment was unanimous. Free speech was free speech. At a Saturday morning prayer breakfast, where he was situated at the front of the room, McCutcheon told me he'd been amused by some of the liberal campaigns run against him. ""Some of the artwork is really good,"" he explained. He could spend what he wanted; they could draw what they wanted. McCutcheon's status at the conference got him a prime prayer breakfast seat. He was one chair down from Sen. Ted Cruz, who was giving the main remarks before giving a longer speech to the full conference. A standing-room crowd heard Cruz run through the successes of the Senate's conservative bloc and heard how the government shutdown, far from backfiring, had exposed the rotten heart of Obamacare. Then came the pivot. ""Democrats in Congress have promised this year that we are going to vote on their proposal to repeal the First Amendment,"" said Cruz. The crowd murmured with disgust. ""I promise you, I'm not making this up,"" said Cruz. ""Forty-one Democrats have signed on to a constitutional amendment that Chuck Schumer has promised we're gonna vote on this year that would give Congress plenary authority to regulate political speech. They've decided that the rise of the grassroots really is scaring the living daylights out of them. There are politicians who really don't like it when the pesky voters express their views and exercise their sovereignty."" Cruz had whittled this line with appearances on conservative talk shows. It was a hit, as he knew it would be. ""It's interesting,"" he continued. ""This amendment specifically says that nothing in it will undermine the freedom of the press. So the New York Times is protected. You and me are not. If this amendment passed, Congress would have the authority to tell the NRA you cannot distribute voter guides telling people how politicians are voting on the Second Amendment. If this amendment passed, Congress would tell the Sierra Club you can't run any ads talking about a candidate's environmental record. If this amendment were to pass, Congress would have the authority to tell Right to Life or Planned Parenthood, either one of them, you can't talk about your views. If this amendment passed, Congress would have the authority to criminalize bloggers, to criminalize movie-makers."" Cruz paused. Dinesh D'Souza, the conservative author and documentarian who had recently pleaded guilty to campaign finance fraud, was scheduled to speak later in the day. ""You notice how they keep indicting movie-makers?"" Cruz said. ""Funny how that happens."" One day later, Cruz would make the same argument in the op-ed pages of the Wall Street Journal. He had to, while it was still legal."	Why the Republican Base Is Rallying to Defend Every Last Donor	['Trump', 'Schumer', 'McCain', 'Roberts', 'Cruz', 'Udall', 'Obama']	[]
9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/shinseki_resigns_here_s_how_to_fix_the_va.html	"President Barack Obama had no choice but to accept Veteran Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki's resignation. The VA inspector general's interim report issued this week contained too many damning findings of ""systemic"" problems that grew under Shinseki's watch. Key among these was the finding that the actual VA primary care wait times in Phoenix averaged 115 days--more than four times the VA's previously reported average of 24 days. That discrepancy revealed a gap between reality and official reporting, and suggested questions about the VA's integrity ran all the way up to the secretary's office. More broadly, the growing VA scandal cast doubt on the ability of the government to deliver health care, a major Obama administration priority. If the White House could not deliver on this promise to veterans, a key constituency for whom the president and vice president have frequently described health care as part of a ""sacred trust,"" then how could the administration be trusted to provide care for all Americans? Coming after the legal and practical challenges to the Affordable Care Act, the White House could not afford another health care failure. And so Shinseki had to go. Unfortunately, his departure will do little to fix the broader problems in the massive VA health care system--and may even set the quasi-leaderless agency back as it waits for a new secretary to be appointed and confirmed. The VA is the second-largest cabinet agency, and the nation's largest health care and benefits provider, with an overall fiscal 2015 budget of $165 billion (greater than the State Department, USAID, and entire intelligence community combined), including $60 billion for health care. The VA employs more than 320,000 personnel to run 151 major medical centers, 820 outpatient clinics, 300 storefront ""Vet Centers,"" more than 50 regional benefits offices, and scores of other facilities. This massive system provides health care to roughly 9 million enrolled veterans, including 6 million who seek care on a regular basis. It's hard to overstate the challenges of leading this massive agency: The ideal candidate would probably fuse the best traits of a general like Shinseki, a politician like Bill Clinton, and a businessman like Lee Iacocca or Mitt Romney. The systemic integrity problems in the VA's health care system, coupled with the broader resource allocation problems they were masking, will remain for the next secretary, whoever he or she is. Here are six ways to begin to fix the VA. 1. Give the VA the resources it needs. Even with its massive $60 billion health care budget, the VA arguably lacks the funding it needs to treat all veterans . This resource shortfall is the root cause of the scheduling shenanigans in Phoenix: If the VA had what it needed, it wouldn't have needed to play fast and loose with veterans' appointments. A group of veterans organizations prepares its own shadow VA budget each year; this year's budget called for approximately $7.8 billion more in VA health funding. This money would go to hiring doctors and nurses (assuming they're available--a national doctor shortage affects the VA too), as well as building or leasing new facilities. 2. Allocate VA resources more smartly. The veteran population is undergoing tremendous demographic and geographic change. As World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and Cold War conscripts die, the veteran population is changing to reflect the all-volunteer force we have today: smaller, more dispersed, more diverse, and increasingly concentrated in urban or coastal areas. Unfortunately, this is not where VA hospitals and clinics are located. The VA is seeing demand from both older veterans and younger veterans. The median age of the veteran population is 64, meaning that the majority of veterans are hitting retirement age and presenting themselves to the VA with service-connected conditions compounded by age. At the same time, veterans from the Iraq and Afghanistan cohort are seeking VA care and benefits in record numbers. The next secretary needs congressional support to shrink or close underutilized VA facilities, build or lease new clinics (favoring outpatient clinics instead of large hospitals, following the overall direction of American health care), and move VA personnel between facilities to reflect where veterans live now, and where they need care. 3. Restructure the VA health care system. The VA divides its health system of 151 hospitals and 820 clinics into 23 regions that don't align with any other geographic scheme within the federal government. These regions lack the leadership, staff capacity, and authority they need to oversee health care facilities. As a result, hospitals have evolved into fiefdoms unto themselves, giving rise to the expression, ""If you've been to one VA hospital, you've been to one VA hospital."" This system must be broken apart and rebuilt to give the secretary the ability to implement national policy, standardize practices, and ensure quality patient care. Ideally, the VA would cut the number of regions and align them in some way with the regions used by the Department of Health and Human Services or Department of Defense TRICARE system. Within these VA health care regions, senior executives should be selected for management expertise and ability, not just for time served as a VA clinician. And regional executives should be picked by the secretary and be accountable to him or her--potentially with a requirement for Senate confirmation--not unlike the system for selection of generals and admirals, who require Senate confirmation at the very top levels. 4. Rebuild the VA's healthcare IT system. Twenty years ago, the VA led the nation in development of electronic health records. Today, the VA has fallen behind. The VA's antiquated systems contributed to the chaos in Phoenix where, reportedly, front-line employees used DOS-based systems to manage appointments and clinical resources. This problem is exacerbated by the VA's balkanized system of regions, hospitals, and clinics. Many facilities have customized their software in ways that don't mesh with other VA facilities. The next VA secretary must completely overhaul this system, much as Shinseki did for the VA's benefits system (at great cost). The VA should consider replacing its antiquated appointments system with one that is more transparent, allowing veterans to see wait times and relative availability across the system, and make health care decisions accordingly. Such solutions exist in the private sector. The VA should embrace them. Likewise, the VA must invest in its health records system, and ideally build one that meshes with the system now being procured by the Pentagon. 5. Integrate better with the private and nonprofit sector. The VA provides exceptional medical care, particularly for service-connected issues such as prosthetics, hearing loss, and combat stress. However, more than two-thirds of veterans seek medical care from non-VA sources rather than the VA, and that's unlikely to change. Many more veterans get care from nonprofit providers, especially for mental health issues. The VA must find ways to integrate its care with that given by the private and nonprofit sector, to provide veterans with ""continuity of care"" wherever they get seen. More pointedly, the VA must better leverage external resources to fill gaps and shortfalls in its care, such as in primary care and mental health care. The demographic changes within the veterans community suggest the VA is seeing its peak demand now, from young and old veterans alike. Building permanent VA infrastructure may not make as much sense as leveraging private providers, contractors, and nonprofit organizations to serve veterans (ideally knitted together by a common health records system). 6. Build a bridge across the Potomac. One of Shinseki's greatest failures belongs also to two other revered cabinet officers, former Defense Secretaries Robert Gates and Leon Panetta. Defense and the VA failed to create an integrated health records system (or separate systems that would talk to each other), and have failed more broadly to synchronize and align the two agencies' care for veterans, service members, and military families. The redundancies between these two agencies cost the taxpayers billions of dollars each year, and worse, create gaps for veterans to fall into, such as when claims submitted to the VA can't be substantiated for lack of Pentagon service records. Even Shinseki, with his long Army lineage and prior service as the top Army general, failed to partner effectively with the Pentagon. The next secretary must do better, especially in a post-war era of fiscal austerity, when both agencies are likely to have fewer dollars to serve their respective populations. There's a lesson from military history that applies well here: Winning armies rarely learn. It takes the strategic shock of defeat to catalyze learning and change within armies. Although the VA doesn't fight wars like its brother agency the Defense Department, it retains a military culture because of its leadership and the large number of veterans who work there. And like the Pentagon, the VA only learns or changes well under enormous external pressure, such as the kind that comes upon losing a war, or occurs during a political scandal like this one. Notwithstanding this week's headlines, the data overwhelmingly show the VA has done well in supporting veterans over the last decade or two. Patient satisfaction scores are high; the claims backlog is down; the VA has worked with the nonprofit community to reduce veteran homelessness by roughly 24 percent in five years. The list goes on. Nonetheless, deep problems remain within the VA that threaten its ability to succeed in the years to come. Today's political crisis may offer the strategic shock the VA needs to address these core issues, now under a new secretary, to serve our veterans as well as they have served us."

Two cars, one of them busted, are parked in a short driveway. A patio is happily cluttered with the toys and bikes of the couple's autistic daughter. The only indication that a political activist lives here is a sign for Senate candidate Chris McDaniel, shoved mostly out of sight, under some stairs. ""Yeah, we're sort of trying to get that out of the way,"" Tara Kelly says, referring to the campaign sign as she invites me to sit on the porch. She's just returned from her regular 30-minute visit with Clayton, who's in prison on a $200,000 bond. (He will only be freed on Thursday, after the bond is reduced.) Ten days earlier he was arrested for allegedly gaining access to the nursing home where Sen. Thad Cochran's wife lies bedridden with dementia, and taking video of what he saw. The video briefly appeared on his YouTube account, Constitutional Clayton, before McDaniel's campaign asked (via an email to other activists) that it be taken down. ""I told him not to do it,"" says Tara Kelly. ""I wouldn't want anyone taking a picture of me in a hospital! But he really wanted to get his name out there as a journalist. And he has gotten his name out there. Just not the way he expected. He thought he was getting the scoop."" Instead, Clayton Kelly made a decision that roiled the year's tightest race between an incumbent Republican and an avatar of the Tea Party. McDaniel, a state senator and former talk show host, entered the race in October 2013, after the Club for Growth had already gone on the air trashing Cochran, and after he'd huddled with conservative PACs that wanted fresh Republican-In-Name-Only scalps. He outraised and outcampaigned a senator who'd won his first congressional campaign a few months after McDaniel was born. The first polling on the race gave Cochran a single-digit lead; the last poll, paid for by one of the many McDaniel-endorsing conservative groups, gives a slight edge to the challenger. That poll was taken after the Cochran campaign and media outlets from Mother Jones to the Wall Street Journal ""vetted"" McDaniel. The candidate had endured weeks of stories about his radio days, and Republican primary voters did not clutch their pearls and flee after they learned McDaniel had criticized rap culture. The only problem: The poll was also taken before the arrest of Constitutional Clayton. It was also taken before police charged three more activists, one of them the vice chairman of the Mississippi Tea Party, Mark Mayfield. ""He didn't even know them when he was sitting in the same cell as them,"" says Tara Kelly. ""My personal opinion is they were just using him as the fall guy. He didn't know them other than over Facebook."" And the poll was definitely taken before Cochran's campaign put out an ad that splayed Clayton Kelly's face across TV screens, called him (correctly) ""a Chris McDaniel supporter charged with a felony,"" and asked voters to rise up and say no to dirty politics. ""Aren't they exploiting his picture as well?"" asks Tara Kelly. ""That's what I think, but that's just my opinion as his wife."" The race will be decided, by people who don't know any of these activists, don't know or want to know what happened at the nursing home, and don't know why the whole imbroglio began. Why was Cochran a target in the first place? On Tuesday, after talking to Kelly, I stop by the biweekly meeting of the Central Mississippi Tea Party, where there'll be a lecture on Obamacare and a huddle about how to beat the senator. ""One way to measure how successful we are is by securing votes for our candidate,"" says Janis Lane, the president of the group. ""Chris McDaniel is the man of the hour. He is chosen for a time such as this. He is our current-day Esther. He is what we need in Mississippi to make a change in the political process of this state."" What ""process"" is that? Lane explains, without getting into specifics, that an accused child molester is currently being held on a $50,000 bond. Twenty-odd activists murmur at that--they do not need to be told that several of their awkward political allies are being held for much more. Lane refers obliquely to McDaniel's ""willingness to put himself and his family in this situation,"" and at how the Tea Party has had ""some challenges thrown in our way, and some obstacles."" After the meeting ends, the activists hang back to explain. ""About three weeks ago, we knew there'd be an 'October surprise,' "" says Don Hartness, a veteran who often stands at the side of a road in Jackson waving an American flag and raising money for the wounded. ""We just didn't know what it was going to be. Mark [Mayfield] is a personal friend, and this is just so out of character for him."" And the whole story has let Cochran slide. According to Tea Party activists, Cochran's alleged conservatism is not backed up by his votes. Any Republican who voted to fund Obamacare in last year's continuing resolution--which, in Washington, was seen as the inevitable outcome after a disastrous conservative feint--is suspect. ""When I watch TV,"" says businesswoman Kay Allen, who's wearing only red, white, and blue, ""whether it's Fox or whoever I watch, I watch for which people are stepping out and putting bills on the floor and saying what they believe. People like Rep. Jason Chaffetz, Sen. Kelly Ayotte, Sen. Ted Cruz, Rep. Trey Gowdy."" The next morning I drive north to the town of Grenada. McDaniel is traveling far outside his base, through northern Mississippi, into the towns that border Tennessee. An 8 a.m. rally is scheduled in the town square, which is marked by a monument to Confederate veterans and anchored by a white gazebo. McDaniel's bus, wrapped with his campaign logo and a king-size picture of the Constitution, rolls past the gazebo and into a nearby lot. The rally is downsized to a meet-and-greet. After the crowd has gathered, McDaniel strolls out of the bus in shirtsleeves and slacks to thank everyone for ""braving the rain."" He praises a retired firefighter (""a heck of a service, isn't it?"") and is thrilled by a Navy veteran who retired after 40 years. ""It was time to do something else,"" says the veteran. ""Just like the Senate, huh?"" says McDaniel. Time for the speech--the short version. ""The conservative movement needs revival,"" McDaniel says. ""It needs resurgence. This is the fertile ground. This is the place to begin this fight, to finally draw a line in the sand, and to win, once and for all."" McDaniel says he'll link arms with the senators who thrill the Tea Party. ""If you've heard of Mike Lee, if you've heard of Ted Cruz, these people have been pushing this agenda for a long time,"" he explains. The agenda is simple: term limits, tax reform, saying no to anything liberal, ending handouts to corporations. ""We're watching the lower class suffer and the middle class suffer while others receive disproportionate benefits from the state and the federal government,"" he says. ""Our people have been poor for too long. It's time to make some changes."" The candidate concludes with a cheeky ""trivia question""--how many people can name a circumstance in which Cochran ""led the fight"" against Barack Obama? It's meant to be unanswerable, and after the crowd disperses, McDaniel's staff makes the state senator available for ""a few basic questions."" This sort of easy openness has been McDaniel's approach since he started running, and it never hurt--it made a nice contrast with Cochran, actually--until the videotaping story. He spent a week fielding leading questions about how he surely must know more than he was letting on. By the time I get to McDaniel, and ask whether the TV ads spotlighting the videotape will backfire, he has perfected a nonanswer answer. ""Here's the thing,"" he says. ""What matters in this race are the issues. Sen. Cochran has been avoiding the issues. There's a reason he's avoiding the issues."" What follows is a recitation of the campaign platform. The videotape story is a ""distraction,"" he says, and then says again. Campaign manager Melanie Sojourner, who called the Cochran campaign to denounce Clayton Kelly and was rewarded by having her voicemail leaked, stands nearby tapping on her phone. ""The voters of Mississippi, they're not going to let any distraction take away from the business at hand."" Less than two hours later, Mississippi Tea Party leaders assemble in Jackson to face the press and reiterate why they support McDaniel. They cannot officially coordinate with McDaniel, but they are speaking his language. Jenny Beth Martin, the president of Tea Party Patriots--its ""Citizens Fund"" is spending half a million dollars on McDaniel ads--refers cryptically to a ""distraction"" that should not affect the race. Leaders from Tupelo in the north to Biloxi on the Gulf Coast lay out just how untrustworthy Cochran is. Why, he even allowed the Senate's immigration bill to proceed to a vote--what else can the Chamber of Commerce coax from him if he wins? The event is opened up for questions. None of the assembled press asks about immigration, the debt, or even the Tea Party's ground game. The questions are all about the videotape. ""I think I know just about every one of you in the press here,"" says Roy Nicholson, who founded the Central Mississippi Tea Party. ""I think I have met just about every one of you. I have to tell you, I'm very disappointed in you. You keep going after the sensational. Go after the facts that are critical of the lives of people!"" More Tea Party leaders grab the microphone. ""The press is supposed to be the Fourth Estate,"" says Laura Van Overschelde. ""It is your responsibility, it is your job, to report what is important to every Mississippian. Not some sensational story you might be interested in!"" The press conference sputters to a close, as some activists decamp to a nearby Chick-fil-A and some stay to plead their case. They remind the press that this is a race about issues and the ""scandal"" albatross is draped around the wrong guy. Why did anyone even bother to snoop around Thad Cochran's wife? Because she's been there for more than a decade, and since then, as meticulously reported at Breitbart.com, Cochran has taken dozens of junkets with his executive assistant Kay Webber. One activist, who doesn't necessarily want to get into it and lower the tone of this race any further, muses about how Webber has been pictured traveling on side-junkets, with the congressional wives. Had the race shaped up differently, the rumor mill might be churning about this. While the Tea Party is rallying in Jackson, Cochran is storming the state on his own campaign bus, stopping off in Hattiesburg. It's there, according to two sources, that a group of suspicious-seeming young voters start asking Cochran about Webber. Cochran counters that the campaign recognizes these ""voters"" from their memberships on a pro-McDaniel Facebook page. The senator presses on without sweating any of this stuff. While covering Cochran's bus tour, Politico confirms that he was rattled by the intrusion into his wife's privacy, and has visited Rose Cochran in the home a few times since the break-in happened. But he betrays no anger or worry about the aftermath. On a visit to Poplarville, Cochran is given a short tour of the city's courthouse before taking three minutes to talk to reporters. ""I couldn't imagine why they'd want to be taking photographs of Rose,"" he says. ""What we did as way of response was advise the local law enforcement."" I ask Cochran why he considers the story important enough to make the focus of TV ads. ""There are a lot of people running ads,"" he says. ""Not just the candidates. I can't control other people's right to free speech, and I'm not going to try to. This is strictly a local law enforcement issue, as far as I'm concerned. It doesn't come under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Senate."" That is a confusing answer. The ad came from Cochran's campaign, complete with the 76-year-old's voice confirming that he ""approve[s] this message."" Maybe I asked about it in a confusing way, or maybe the senator has settled on a total-aloofness strategy ever since approving the ad. Regardless, the controversy has freed up Cochran to campaign like what he is--a 36-year senator who wants to serve in a Republican majority. On Thursday morning the Cochran bus stops at an emergency training session in Biloxi's convention center, overlooking the Gulf of Mexico that overran this place in 2005. At that time, before the Tea Party, Cochran got Congress to nearly double the amount of money it initially pledged for Hurricane Katrina relief. When McDaniel suggested that some of the funds were misspent--a perfectly ordinary Tea Party position--Cochran's campaign pounced. How could the state risk replacing a senator who brought home funds with one who questioned how to get them? On Thursday, five days before the polls open, Cochran ambles around the convention center shaking hands and swapping short anecdotes about growing up in Mississippi. There is no Tea Party rage, and certainly no gossip. Robert Latham, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency's director, guides Cochran around the room and back to his bus, then muses about what a great senator he's been. Can he lead a fight against Obama? Honestly, who cares? ""What you see on the Gulf Coast here now would not have happened without him,"" says Latham. ""FEMA funds just don't put you back. Without the [Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery] money he got, this coast would still look like it did after Katrina. And now he's in a position to maybe become chairman of appropriations again."""	Will an Illegal Video of His Bedridden Wife Give Veteran Sen. Thad Cochran Six More Years?

It's how he beat the Clintons, passed Obamacare, and cruised to re-election in a bad economy. I sympathize with Obama and support his domestic policy goals, but this always struck me as overstated. Obama is a talented politician, but in his five years as president, he's made major political mistakes. The 2011 debt ceiling crisis was a huge debacle that threatened the global economy, and it owes itself--in part--to Obama's decision to negotiate the debt limit, bucking precedent and sparking a spiral of Republican intransigence. He ended the standoff with a series of deals, but not without damage to his standing and the country. If there's another failure in the cards for Obama, it's immigration. Since 2009 the president has pressed for comprehensive immigration reform at the same time that he's increased border security. By 2012, in fact, the administration was spending unprecedented sums on border security and immigration enforcement, with results to match: That year, the administration removed 409,849 unauthorized immigrants from the United States, a record number. Implicit in all of this was a political calculation. If Democrats cracked down on illegal immigrants, then Republicans might be more willing to come to the table for a broader solution. This paid dividends last year, when the Senate passed a comprehensive reform bill that overhauled the nation's immigration laws with tougher security and a path to legalization and citizenship for 11 million unauthorized immigrants. But this victory crashed on the shores of the House of Representatives, where Tea Party Republicans opposed any new overhaul, and could bend House Speaker John Boehner to their will. Their argument for inaction was easy: They couldn't trust the president. To many House Republicans, Obama is a lawless tyrant who refuses to obey the rule of law, hence the post-hoc changes to Affordable Care Act. ""If the president can selectively enforce Obamacare, what's to say he cannot selectively enforce border security?"" said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor last year. And in his frantic drive away from the Senate compromise--which angered conservatives--Florida Sen. Marco Rubio echoed the concern. ""You have a government, and a White House, that has consistently decided to ignore the law, or how to apply it,"" he said on Fox News Sunday ""Look at the health care law. The law is on the books. They decide which parts of it to apply and which parts not to apply. They issue their own waivers without any congressional oversight."" That was in the fall, and it's where we've been ever since. In February, Boehner repeated the concern. ""[O]ne of the biggest obstacles we face is trust,"" he said during a press conference. ""The American people and including many of my members don't trust that the reform we're talking about will be implemented as it was intended to be."" Even with all of this, however, President Obama still thinks he can get immigration reform from a recalcitrant GOP. Which is why he's directed the secretary of homeland security to delay a deportation enforcement review, that--according to the New York Times--""officials feared would anger House Republicans and doom any lingering hopes for an immigration overhaul in Congress this year."" But like the push to negotiate the debt ceiling, this is an insane calculation. There's no reason to think Republicans have changed their thinking on immigration reform, comprehensive or otherwise. ""[F]or all practical purposes,"" notes Greg Sargent for the Washington Post, ""the position of many Republicans right now is that the only acceptable policy response to the immigration crisis is maximum deportations from the interior."" House Republicans even refuse to vote on something as inoffensive as the ENLIST Act, which gives legal status to young unauthorized immigrants if they serve in the military. Delaying the deportation review won't bring Republicans to the table. In the meantime, the White House will continue its mass deportation of unauthorized immigrants. So far, in fact, the administration has removed about 2 million people from the United States, most of whom were Latino. And if the current pace continues, Obama will have deported more people by the end of 2014 than George W. Bush did in his entire tenure. Or, put another way, the National Council of La Raza wasn't exaggerating when, in March, it called President Obama ""the deporter-in-chief."" It's hard to overstate the human cost of Obama's deportation policies. ""In 2012 alone,"" writes Dara Lind for Vox, ""an estimated 150,000 US citizen children lost a parent to deportation."" Tens of thousands have been deported for petty crimes or no crimes at all, and tens of thousands more have been plunged into our Kafkaesque system of border detention. More than 1 million Latinos have been separated from family members through deportation, and many more live with that fear. If Democrats hold a demographic advantage in national elections, it's because of their high standing with Latino voters. Indeed, huge Latino support is key to Democratic chances in states as diverse as Florida, New Mexico, and Georgia, where shades of blue have crept into the statewide picture. For years, they've been patient on immigration reform, supporting Obama through the deportations, which aren't a distant concern--63 percent of registered Latino voters know someone who is undocumented. And according to new research from Latino Decisions, their patience is wearing thin:"	Why Obama's Immigration Policy Will Haunt Democrats	['Rubio', 'Obama']	[]

The Republican National Committee has hired dozens of black and Latino field representatives, and Chairman Reince Priebus has made the rounds at churches and historically black colleges across the country. Conservatives continue to argue that Democrats have been bad for blacks, Latinos, and other minorities. ""What we're hearing from black voters and people within our community is that it's the president's economic policies that are hurting them the most,"" said the RNC's Orlando Watson in an interview last year. Even if that is spin, there's no doubt that minorities--and blacks in particular--have struggled in the current economy. At 11.6 percent, the unemployment rate for black Americans is staggeringly high, with little sign of declining, even for college graduates. Low-income blacks are increasingly segregated from the mainstream economy, and their middle-class counterparts are still reeling from the Great Recession and its calamitous effect on black housing wealth. With all of that comes a question: If current conditions are so bad for black Americans, why haven't they abandoned the Democrats? For some conservatives, the answer is that blacks suffer from a sort of false consciousness, in which they've forgotten the civil rights victories of the Republican Party. The crude version comes from figures like Herman Cain, who claims that blacks have been ""brainwashed into not being open-minded, not even considering a conservative point of view."" On the other end are conservative writers, like Kevin D. Williamson, that see blacks as the helpless victims of cynical racial bribery.

A growing majority--54 percent as of a Pew survey released just last month--favor legalization, and an even larger majority of millennials (69 percent) feels the same way. Colorado and Washington are the first states to move decisively in this direction, but they won't be the last. I basically think this is an OK development. Like Mark Kleiman, a public policy professor at UCLA who is my guru on the regulation of controlled substances, I see full commercial legalization as a truly terrible idea, while I think noncommercial legalization, ideally via monopolies owned and operated by state governments, would be an improvement over the status quo. Regardless, marijuana legalization is coming, one way or another. One thing that is really striking about the new Pew data is that 69 percent of Americans believe, correctly, that alcohol is more harmful to society than marijuana. When asked if alcohol would still be more harmful to society than marijuana if marijuana were just as easy to get a hold of as alcohol is now, 63 percent said that yes, it would be. Most people see marijuana's relative harmlessness as a reason for us to regulate marijuana as lightly as we regulate alcohol. I see things differently. The fact that alcohol is more harmful to society than marijuana is a reason to regulate alcohol more stringently than we regulate marijuana. In other words, let's ease up on marijuana Prohibition and ramp up good old-fashioned alcohol Prohibition. More precisely I favor something like what the libertarian journalist Greg Beato calls, and not in a nice way, ""Prohibition Lite."" Though it is true that I was raised in a Muslim household, it is not my intention to impose sharia law on you and yours. As someone who came to drinking late in life, I still marvel at its disinhibiting effects and I genuinely appreciate the good it can do by, essentially, helping awkward people have fun. I also think there is much to be said for psychoactive substances like MDMA, or Molly, which have enormous therapeutic potential. But alcohol is crazily dangerous, and it needs to be more tightly controlled. Everyone knows that Prohibition was a disaster. What most of us forget is that the movement for Prohibition arose because alcohol abuse actually was destroying American society in the first decades of the 20th century, and the strictly-regulated post-Prohibition alcohol market was shaped by still-fresh memories of the pre-Prohibition era. For a nightmare vision of where heavy drinking can lead a society, consider Russia, where the pervasiveness of binge drinking contributes to an epidemic of cardiovascular disease and a death rate from fatal injuries that you'd normally see in wartime. Political economist Nicholas Eberstadt has gone so far as to suggest that drunkenness is a key reason why Russia, a country with universal literacy and a level of educational attainment that is (technically) in the same ballpark as countries like Australia and Sweden, has roughly the same living standards as Ecuador. Closer to home, Great Britain has seen a staggering increase in alcohol consumption since the 1990s, much of it among teenagers. Tim Heffernan, writing in the Washington Monthly, has attributed Britain's binge-drinking crisis to its laissez-faire alcohol market, which has allowed for the vertical integration of the liquor business. America has been shielded from U.K.-style liquor conglomerates by those post-Prohibition regulations that inflate the cost of making, moving, and selling booze, but that's now changing thanks to big multinationals like Anheuser-Busch InBev and MillerCoors, which are working hand in glove with national retail chains like Costco to make alcohol as cheap and accessible as they can. Why would I, a great lover of the free enterprise system, want the alcohol market to be more heavily regulated? Precisely because I'm a believer in the power of the profit motive, I understand how deadly it can be when the product being sold is intoxication. For-profit businesses exist to increase sales. The most straightforward way to do that is not to encourage everyone to drink moderately, but to focus on the small minority of people who drink the most. That is exactly what liquor companies do, and they'll do more of it if we let Big Liquor have its way. In Marijuana Legalization: What Everyone Needs to Know, the authors estimate that at current beer prices, it costs about $5 to $10 to get drunk, or a dollar or two per drunken hour. To get a sense of what the world would look like if that price fell significantly, go to a typical town square in England on a weekend night, where alcohol-fueled violence is rampant, or to Russia, where the ruling class has used cheap vodka as a tool to keep the population drunk, passive, and stupid for generations. We shouldn't be satisfied with keeping the per dollar cost of getting drunk where it is today. We should make it higher. Much higher. Kleiman and his colleagues Jonathan P. Caulkins and Angela Hawken have suggested tripling the federal alcohol tax from 10 cents a drink to 30 cents a drink, an increase that they estimate would prevent 6 percent of homicides and 6 percent of motor vehicle deaths, thus sparing 3,000 lives (1,000 from the drop in homicides, 2,000 from safer highways) every year. Charging two-drink-per-day drinkers an extra $12 per month seems like a laughably small price to pay to deter binge drinking. Then, of course, there is the fact that a higher alcohol tax would also raise revenue. If you're going to tax tanning beds and sugary soft drinks, why on earth wouldn't you raise alcohol taxes too? If anything, 30 cents a drink isn't high enough. Let's raise the alcohol tax to a point just shy of where large numbers of people will start making illegal moonshine in their bathtubs. Kleiman et al. have also suggested creating separate ""drinking licenses."" Bars wouldn't just check the IDs of the young-looking. They'd check everyone's drinking licenses, and those who've had them revoked for some reason (drunk driving, let's say) would be bounced. A related reform would actually lower the drinking age, to get underage drinking out of the shadows and to socialize older teenagers into drinking responsibly. I would go further. Libertarians like Beato can't stand former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg for his constant efforts to reduce the smoking rate, which have succeeded in reducing smoking while dramatically raising the costs borne by poor smokers. For example, Beato reports that smokers earning less than $30,000 a year now spend almost a quarter of their income on cigarettes, or twice as much as they did a decade ago. Yet even Bloomberg's harshest critics acknowledge that smoking rates have declined. Rather remarkably, New York City's adult smoking rate is 14 percent, well below the nationwide rate of 19.3 percent. This is despite the fact that the five boroughs are chock full of immigrants from countries where smoking is all the rage. And it's not just because of higher cigarette taxes. Apart from banning smoking in restaurants, bars, and public parks, Bloomberg used a series of social marketing campaigns to sell people, and particularly young people, on the dangers of smoking. Recently, Derek Thompson of the Atlantic riffed on new research from the marketing professors Caleb Warren and Margaret C. Thompson, who argue that ""coolness"" is ""a measured violation of malign expectations."" Instead of simply warning young people of the dangers of drunkenness, we need to make binge drinking seem mainstream and thus lame. This will be extremely difficult because, as I've learned to my detriment, being drunk can be quite fun--until you wet the bed or start murdering people."

The civil rights revolution of the 1960s was vital, but it wasn't a panacea, and the problems of today--from the racial wealth gap to the crumbling ghettos of the Midwest--stem from the racist policies of our recent past. Or, as Coates puts it, ""White supremacy is ... a force so fundamental to America that it is difficult to imagine the country without it."" This is more than rhetoric. Black families paid taxes and black soldiers fought for democracy in Europe and the Pacific, but--from low-interest home loans to money for education--they were barred from the benefits of the G.I. Bill. Indeed, the same federal dollars that built the suburbs were used to keep blacks out of them. It was the federal government that ""pioneered the practice of redlining,"" writes Coates, ""selectively granting loans and insisting that any property it insured be covered by a restrictive covenant--a clause in the deed forbidding the sale of the property to anyone other than whites. Millions of dollars flowed from tax coffers into segregated white neighborhoods."" At the same time, ""legislatures, mayors, civic associations, banks, and citizens all colluded to pin black people into ghettos, where they were overcrowded, overcharged, and undereducated."" The case for reparations, in short, is straightforward. As a matter of public policy, America stole wealth from black people, denied them a shot at prosperity, and deprived them of equal citizenship. And that's just the 20th century. If you go beyond that--to include all stolen income from the revolution to secession--the balance falls deep into the red. In 1860, translated to today's terms, slaves represented a staggering $10 trillion in wealth, an incredible sum. If you include compound interest--to represent the compounding plunder of the next century--you are left with an implausibly large amount of money. Wisely, Coates doesn't try to build a proposal for reparations. At most, he endorses a bill--HR 40--that would authorize a government study of reparations. Instead, his goal is to demonstrate the recent origins of racial inequality, the role of the federal government, the role of private actors, and the extent to which the nation--as a whole--is implicated. Even if your Irish immigrant grandparents never owned slaves, or even lived around black people, they still reaped the fruits of state-sanctioned--and state-directed--theft, through cheap loans, cheap education, and an unequal playing field. If anything, what Coates wants is truth and reconciliation for white supremacy--a national reckoning with our history. As he writes, ""More important than any single check cut to any African American, the payment of reparations would represent America's maturation out of the childhood myth of its innocence into a wisdom worthy of its founders."" Still, even if ""no number can fully capture the multi-century plunder of black people in America,"" there's still value in imagining a concrete scheme for reparations, if only to have a sense of the bills we owe. And so, how would we accomplish the task? Would you attempt a massive transfer of wealth? Or would you try to compensate black communities with targeted policies? The ""wealth option,"" accomplished by cash payments, is what we tend to think when we hear ""reparations."" In this scenario, the federal government would mail checks to individuals, either in a lump sum or spread out over time. There are a few, immediate concerns with this notion. First, who is eligible? Given the pervasiveness of anti-black prejudice, should it go to all black Americans--who, regardless of origin, deal with the burden of white supremacy--or should it go to the descendants of slaves, who share a unique disadvantage? And how do we determine lineage? Through self-reporting? Through a comprehensive census of black Americans? Genealogical records for slaves are so scarce that any method of selection will come with the risk of fraud, since for most, we can't confirm with absolute certainty that a given person is a descendant of slaves. And even if we could agree on recipients, how much should individuals receive? A uniform sum or an amount based on your heritage, i.e., the more enslaved ancestors you have, the bigger your payment? Even with all of those questions, however, there's a lot to recommend when it comes to cash benefits. For starters, it empowers individuals, families, and communities. They know what they need, and we should trust them to figure out their own interests over the long term. Yes, a cash scheme could never be fully fair, but that's not the point; what we want is to heal injury and balance accounts, and on that score, it could work. On the other end is the policy approach. Instead of cash, the federal government would implement an agenda to tackle racial inequality at its roots. This agenda would focus on major areas of concern: housing, criminal justice, education, and income inequality. As for the policies themselves, they don't require a ton of imagination. To break the ghettos and reduce the hyper-segregation of black life, the federal government would aggressively enforce the Fair Housing Act, with attacks on housing and lending discrimination, and punishment for communities that exclude low-income residents with exclusionary zoning. What's more, it would provide vouchers for those who want to move, subsidized mortgages for those who want to own, and huge investments in transportation infrastructure, to break urban and rural isolation and connect low-income blacks to jobs in wealthier, whiter areas. On the education front, state governments could end education budgets based on local property taxes--which disadvantage poor communities and disproportionately hurt blacks--and the federal government could invest in school reconstruction, modernization, and vouchers--for parents who want their children in private schools--in addition to higher education subsidies for black Americans. These ""in-kind"" benefits have the virtue of freeing up disposable income, thus acting as de facto cash payments. It almost goes without saying that this move for policy reparations would include an end to the war on drugs, an end to mass incarceration, and a national re-evaluation of police procedures to reduce racial profiling. And, looking forward, it could include progressive ""baby bonds""--federally managed investment accounts with modest annual growth rates. At $60 billion a year, according to one proposal, this would help ameliorate wealth inequality for future generations. There are more policies along these lines, no doubt. The advantage, for most of these, is that they are both universal and hugely beneficial to black Americans. Of course, however you designed a reparations scheme, it would be incredibly unpopular. Between our racialized disdain for the ""undeserving"" and general distaste for intrusive government, nothing on this scale could get off the ground. Even if it could, there's an excellent chance the courts would kill it. And ultimately, as Coates writes, the money isn't important. What's critical is that we reckon with our national crimes against black Americans, to say nothing of Native Americans and other minority groups. We must wrestle with our history, lest we ignore the ""certain sins of the future""--or worse--the sins of our present."	How America Should Pay Reparations	['Black']	[]

Yesterday the Washington Post reported that Democratic Virginia state Sen. Phillip P. Puckett would resign, allegedly to accept a lucrative new job as deputy director of the state tobacco commission, and to pave the way for his daughter to get a permanent judgeship. Puckett's move flips control of the state Senate over to Republicans, who have been locked in a fight to the death with Gov. Terry McAuliffe over his push to expand Medicaid in the commonwealth. He tendered his formal resignation this morning, to much public outrage over a possible quid pro quo. This afternoon he indicated that he will not be seeking the tobacco commission job after all. (His daughter, as far as I know, will still get her judgeship.) Until we know more about the deal itself, it's difficult to say much about the legal questions beyond the fact that it stinks pretty badly. Commentators are already using the word bribery, and also bribery, to describe the nature of the arrangement. Here's what we do know: The partisan fight over Medicaid expansion--which would have afforded 400,000 more Virginians access to affordable health care--has turned into a statewide snarling contest over the new state budget, one that may end in a government shutdown if it's not resolved before the start of the commonwealth's new fiscal year on July 1. The Virginia House is controlled by Republicans, who are fighting the Medicaid expansion tooth and nail. Until today the Senate was split 20-20 along party lines with a tie-breaking vote going to the Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam. Not only does Puckett's departure mean that Democrats lose control of the Senate and possibly the Medicaid fight, he also represents a heavily Republican region that will likely become a permanent GOP seat after the special election to replace him. It has also not gone unobserved that this same heavily Republican region would benefit significantly from the proposed expansion. An estimated 20,000 of Puckett's constituents would be eligible for health coverage under the expansion. Virginia is one of 24 states that has refused to accept the Medicaid expansion--federal money that would pay for health care coverage for Americans who make too much to qualify for current Medicaid benefits and too little to afford Obamacare. McAuliffe campaigned on a promise to take it, and he has insisted that an expansion must be part of the new budget. Republicans want him to decouple the expansion from the proposed two-year budget. As a result, each side is trading accusations that the other will shut down the government over Medicaid. If both the Senate and the House vote against the expansion, McAuliffe will be forced to veto the budget, at which point the optics will suggest that he's the source of the shutdown. He has also apparently been exploring mechanisms by which he could bypass the Legislature altogether and pass the expansion by executive order. Either way, it won't be pretty for him. Before Puckett resigned, McAuliffe could have continued to push the expansion with the backing of the Senate. So why did Puckett decide to leave now? According to the Washington Post Puckett did not respond to calls seeking comment about the deal. But ""other Republicans denied that Puckett was offered the jobs in exchange for his resignation."" Puckett cited family reasons for stepping down, and the generous reading of the Puckett deal is that he did it to advance his daughter's judicial career. Martha Puckett Ketron is a juvenile and domestic relations district court judge with a temporary appointment that could only be made permanent if her father resigned his seat: The Senate has a policy against appointing the relatives of legislators to the bench. Del. Terry G. Kilgore (R-Scott), chairman of the tobacco commission, put it this way to the Post last night: ""It should pave the way for his daughter. ... She's a good judge. ... I would say that he wanted to make sure his daughter kept her judgeship. A father's going do that."" Maybe. But 20,000 constituents without health care are probably wondering why a legislator is going to do that in order to do that. I am hardly the first person to point out that the former governor of Illinois, Rod Blagojevich, was indicted for trying to sell Barack Obama's former Senate seat, and on charges of using his position to benefit himself, his family, and his campaign. Right now Virginia is on the edge of its seat as we prepare for the corruption and bribery trial of former Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife Maureen, who face a 14 count indictment stemming from their acceptance of more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from Jonnie R. Williams Sr., the CEO of Star Scientific. The trial starts July 28. Key questions will include what ""bribery"" really is and what ""quid pro quo"" really means. And those are precisely the questions, according to Think Progress' Ian Millhiser, that we should start asking about Phil Puckett as well. As he writes today, ""Under Virginia's bribery law, it is a felony for a state lawmaker to ""accept[] or agree[] to accept from another ... any pecuniary benefit offered, conferred or agreed to be conferred as consideration for or to obtain or influence the recipient's decision, opinion, recommendation, vote or other exercise of discretion as a public servant or party official."" Early reporting suggests that with the Senate now split 20-19, it is likely to vote against expanding Medicaid, but that isn't a certainty. Three GOP senators had hinted that they would vote for the expansion, in which case Puckett's defection won't necessarily tip the outcome. Still, the threat to the Medicaid expansion is real. Already this morning, Chuck Colgan, a Senate Democrat who is co-chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, suggested that maybe it's time to pass a state budget without expanding Medicaid eligibility and revisit the expansion later, in a special session. This is essentially what state Republicans have been asking for all along. In a contest to see whether Virginia Republicans or McAuliffe would blink first, McAuliffe may have just had an eye taken out."

16	16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/06/hillary_clinton_s_hard_choices_former_secretary_of_state_s_new_book_plays.html	"During the 2008 campaign, Hillary Clinton ran a blunt television ad asking whether Barack Obama could handle a foreign policy crisis. In it, a phone rang and a variety of children were shown in their beds. ""It's 3 a.m. and your children are safe and asleep. Who do you want answering the phone?"" asked the narrator. After the parade of adorables, the ad showed Clinton on the phone. It was a contrivance since she'd never answered a red phone either. But now she has, and over more than 600 pages of Hard Choices, her memoir of her time as secretary of state, Clinton details what it's like to steer U.S. diplomacy in a dangerous and changing world. It turns out the secretary of state's emergency phone is actually yellow and that the world of campaign ads is more exciting than the incremental painful work of diplomacy. (Unless you find excitement in the strengthening of multilateral responses to Chinese encroachment on international boundaries in the South China Sea.) This book, which is not scheduled to launch until June 10, but which clever elves from CBS This Morning found in a bookstore, is a risk-free telling of Clinton's world travels. Parents who read it will startle no sleeping children reacting to its admissions, and nothing in it would seem to imperil Clinton's future presidential chances--though Vladimir Putin, whom she calls ""thin skinned,"" might be grumpy if they ever have a bilateral meeting together. What comes across, though, is that whatever Clinton leaves out--and there's plenty in her omissions for critics--she put in thousands of hours grinding her way across the globe doing the painstaking work of diplomacy. This is not a book from someone who has nothing to lose. When former Defense Secretary Robert Gates wrote his recent book, Duty, it was full of tough assessments and candor. Clinton's book has no gossip, which is no surprise, but it also only hints at the inside feel of the way national security policy is made. Gates' book had lots of spice, which is always part of even a well-functioning foreign policy team. Clinton's account is the low-salt, low-fat, low-calorie offering with vanilla pudding as the dessert. She goes on at great length, but not great depth. Even Condoleezza Rice, one of the most loyal Bush aides on the planet, was more candid in her memoir about the inside workings of power relationships than Clinton. Describing her effort as national security adviser to get the egos in Bush's foreign policy team to focus on postwar planning in Iraq, she said that President Bush started a meeting by announcing, ""This is something Condi has wanted to talk about."" She wrote, ""I could immediately see that the generals no longer thought it to be a serious question."" After the meeting, her deputy Stephen Hadley said that he ""would have resigned after that comment by the President,"" and later, when the lack of postwar planning became plain to everyone, she wondered ""if Steve had been right."" Clinton's book has none of this. She describes a ""shouting match"" with Leon Panetta over a drone strike but doesn't tell us why voices were raised. She snaps once when a question is mistranslated and she thinks a student in Kinshasa is asking what her husband thinks. ""My husband is not the Secretary of State. I am. So you ask my opinion and I will tell you my opinion."" The young man was asking about Obama's opinion, not Bill Clinton's. It's hard to imagine the author of this book snapping about much of anything. The tone is easy, confident, and placid. It starts after the 2008 election, with Clinton feeling like she let her supporters down but anxious to repair relations with Obama. She portrays her relationship with her opponent as brusque but cordial, like the opposing football coaches greeting each other after a game. Then, when Obama has beaten her, she describes the two of them like teenagers on a first date. Though she admits to some early tensions between ""Hillaryland"" and ""Obamaworld,"" the book only glances at the tensions between the State Department and the National Security Council. Clinton occasionally ascribes political thinking to the White House, and talks about the political urge among Obama's aides to hunker down and go into damage control, but those asides are mild and infrequent. When Clinton holds a different view than her president, as she did on big issues like arming the Syrian opposition and pressuring former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, there is no rancor.* The entire message of the book is that foreign policy is hard and complicated, so when Obama goes another route, Clinton explains that it was a reasonable path to take having weighed all the complexities. If two wrongs don't make a right, this book seems to operate under the theory that 381 rights might overcome a wrong. Clinton repeats her regret about voting for the Iraq war but upgrades her language. ""I was wrong,"" she says. But on so many other issues, however, Clinton always seems to be right. She told the Obama campaign not to attack Sarah Palin when John McCain first picked her as his running mate. She was ""an early voice calling publicly for Palestinian statehood."" Her ""diplomatic intervention in Egypt after Mubarak's fall was the only thing standing in the way of a more explosive confrontation."" She warned Middle Eastern leaders before the Arab Spring uprising ""that if they did not embrace reform their region was going to sink into the sand."" After Mubarak was ousted, Clinton ""came away worried that they would end up handing the country to the Muslim Brotherhood or the military by default, which in the end is exactly what happened."" She reports that world leaders agreed with her assessment and started using her language. The book falls into a pattern where either events lead up to a confirmation of her perceptive initial take or her wisdom is the only thing leading to a good result. ""Some of the President's advisors, keeping their eyes on the reelection campaign, were allergic to the idea of any apology,"" she writes after 24 Pakistani soldiers were killed accidentally by U.S. forces. But Clinton explains why it's important to soothe Pakistani feelings to keep supply lines open for U.S. troops. And whaddya know: It worked! Clinton does not stop to engage in introspection about the Iraq decision or any evolutions in her positions or mistakes she might have made. The hard choices she writes about are ones where she and the president are managing vast, complex interlocking interests with no clear path. She writes, for example, that Syria was a ""wicked problem."" But what she does not tell us is what she learned from blowing any of the hard choices. She regrets her Iraq vote, the deaths in Benghazi, and that the United States didn't do more to help Iranian protesters, but she's not going to put herself on the couch. At one point she writes, ""Your critics can actually teach you lessons your friends can't or won't. I try to sort out the motivation for criticism whether partisan, ideological, commercial, or sexist, analyze it to see what I might learn from it, and discard the rest."" It would have been fascinating to see some evidence of this in the book. Secretary Clinton certainly doesn't put herself on the couch when it comes to the attack on Benghazi. Clinton devotes two chapters to Libya. The first is about the messy and perilous process of keeping the coalition together. Like several passages in the book--on Syria, Egypt, Afghanistan, and even China--there is a good pace to developments and the back-and-forth will be interesting for anyone who'd like to know more about the competing interests of nations. It feels like a lively textbook. The chapter on the attack on Benghazi recounts events and reprises the spirited defense she and her team have been making for months. As a campaign document, Hard Choices presents the picture of a methodical, hardworking public servant. For voters who worry about a complex world, Clinton will be the candidate most equipped to show voters that they will not be taking a risk by putting the world in her hands. But if Hillary Clinton decides to run for president, the election will be decided by what voters feel about the economy. Clinton closes the book talking about the unresolved economic challenges facing the country--student debt, a weak job market, and a struggling middle class. They were the ones that she wanted to get back to after her 2008 primary loss, she writes in the book's opening pages, before Obama convinced her to be his secretary of state. Now she has a chance to return to those issues as a presidential candidate, if she wants to. ""Will I run for President in 2016?"" she asks. ""The answer is, I haven't decided yet."" But 600 pages of safe, methodical writing suggest the answer is yes, and if she doesn't run maybe she'll write an epilogue and tell us what she really thinks. *Correction, June 6, 2014: This article originally misstated that Clinton differed with Obama over arming the Syrian military.

17	17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/06/obamacare_is_evil_how_long_can_republicans_afford_to_equate_the_affordable.html	We are nine months into the era of Obamacare, and so far, it looks like a success. Between the state exchanges, healthcare.gov, and the Medicaid expansion, an estimated 17.2 million people have received health insurance under the law. In turn, according to Gallup, the percentage of Americans without health insurance has dipped to 13.4 percent, down 3.7 percentage points from where it was at the end of last year. Democratic candidates are touting its benefits, while a few Republicans have shied away from harsh attacks to avoid a backlash from voters. But it doesn't matter that Obamacare is becoming a banal part of the policy landscape. For some on the right, it's still the worst thing to happen to the United States. In a recent interview with conservative radio host Armstrong Williams and Daily Beast contributor Evan Gahr, Dr. Ben Carson--the famed neurosurgeon turned conservative celebrity--called the Affordable Care Act a worse event than the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001:	Obamacare Is Worse Than 9/11, Slavery, and the Holocaust--and Other GOP Talking Points	['Williams']	['healthcare']
18	18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/06/bowe_bergdahl_prisoner_swap_obama_finally_releases_detainees_from_gitmo.html	"I believed Barack Obama when he promised to close Guantanamo. It sounds so naive. But in the days after his first inauguration, I didn't think twice about betting Ann Althouse that our new president would keep his promise to close the offshore military prison within a year. Of course, Obama caved and Althouse won. Congress resisted both releasing the detainees--so-called enemy combatants whom the United States scooped up in Pakistan and Afghanistan in the wake of 9/11--and moving them to a military brig on U.S. soil. After Attorney General Eric Holder lost his bid to try 9/11 planner Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in New York, Obama slunk away. Instead of trying the Gitmo detainees in federal court, his administration has made do with sputtering proceedings before military tribunals, which afford fewer procedural protections than regular court, and offer a window to admitting evidence gathered by coercion. A desperate hunger strike in the prison has become a macabre spectacle, with force-feedings that inflict ""unnecessary pain"" because of Department of Defense ""intransigence,"" according to an anguished federal judge, yet must go on lest determined, suffering detainees die. Instead of releasing 78 men cleared for transfer by his own task force, Obama has kept them at Gitmo even though most have had this limbo status since January 2010. But now, in exchange for the freedom of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, the president has released five prisoners who sound dangerous. They were not cleared for transfer. They had mid- or high-level roles in the Taliban in Afghanistan. These are not the detainees who wound up in Gitmo because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time, or because the U.S. was offering $5,000 bounties to the Pakistanis for turning in anyone who could be passed off as a suspected terrorist. According to CNN, one of the five, Mullah Mohammad Fazl, ""commanded the main force fighting the U.S.-backed Northern Alliance in 2001, and served as chief of army staff under the Taliban regime. He has been accused of war crimes during Afghanistan's civil war in the 1990s."" It does not comfort me that Fazl and the others are Taliban rather than al-Qaida. Or that they have to spend a year in Qatar before they can go home. What are the chances these men will end up joining up with extremists, or returning to Afghanistan as American troops are pulling out and adding to the pile of woes that are surely in store there? The odds seem high. That's the grim bet I'd take today. After all this time, it turns out that the president is willing to let go detainees who pose a risk--even as he holds on to dozens who probably don't. Another fail on Obama's part: He didn't tell Congress about the prisoner release 30 days ahead of time, as a recent federal law requires. To justify this omission, the administration has invoked Obama's signing statement, which he added to the law for ""certain circumstances,"" like negotiating over detainee transfers, in which it ""would violate constitutional separation of powers principles"" to consult Congress. The idea is that if Congress had been notified 30 days in advance, the negotiations over the trade could have been jeopardized by a leak, ruining our chance of rescuing Bergdahl. The president's lawyers think that for Congress to require advance notice in this scenario is to intrude on the president's war-making powers. And so Obama took it upon himself to create his own emergency exception. Obama called signing statements an ""abuse"" when George W. Bush used them to ""advance sweeping theories of executive power,"" as Charles Savage puts it in the New York Times. Now he's using signing statements to make his own power grab. It's another version of Obama's disappointing switch on surveillance, from the candidate who said ""no more illegal wiretapping of American citizens"" to the president who says that the National Security Agency's mass data sweeps are legal because they were presented to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for a rubber stamp. Presidents tend toward overreach. Congress isn't good at pushing back. Each president who usurps more authority for his office makes it easier for the next one to do more of the same. This will be a part of Obama's legacy that darkens over time. But it's Guantanamo that looms largest and blackest now. I don't know what to think about the contested accusations that Bergdahl's decision to walk away from his unit in Afghanistan five years ago cost other Americans their lives, or how to feel about whether ""leave no man behind"" should extend to deserters. I'm glad United States policy isn't driven by obsession over rescuing prisoners of war; I'm also glad Bergdahl is home. In five years of captivity with the Taliban, he surely suffered enough. But what about the suffering of Jihad Ahmed Mujstafa Diyab, the Syrian held in Guantanamo for 12 years without a trial, a man on the 2010 list of recommended transfers, who is being strapped against his will into a chair so a feeding tube can be forced into his nose and down his throat? The government doesn't want to send Diyab back to Syria in the middle of the war there. Uruguay has offered to take him and five other detainees. Yet they're still in Gitmo. As Andy Worthington writes at PolicyMic, for the 78 men cleared for transfer who remain imprisoned, ""the release of the five Taliban prisoners is unlikely to cause anything but despair."" Last month the president said on NPR, as he has said before, ""We cannot in good conscience maintain a system of indefinite detention in which individuals who have not been tried and convicted are held permanently in this legal limbo outside of this country."" But that is exactly the system he is maintaining. Because he can. The Supreme Court lost interest in Guantanamo years ago, turning down appeal after appeal since 2008. For Obama, the calculation can only be this: In office, it is simply not worth the political price to stand up for miserable men in orange jumpsuits with long foreign names. And so even as he inveighs against the ""system,"" other than the five Taliban traded for Bergdahl, only one Guantanamo detainee has been released this year. If I'm counting right, there are 149 men left in the prison. How many of them will die there? I'm not talking now about death by hunger strike. I'm talking about death by old age. That is where indefinite detention ends. Bush created this monster. But it will haunt Obama, too, if he doesn't slay it."

19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/06/thad_cochran_and_chris_mcdaniels_run_off_the_republican_party_s_civil_war.html	"The candidate who boasted she had castrated hogs won the Republican Senate primary in Iowa Tuesday, and in the bitter Mississippi GOP primary race, it might just come to that. The fight in the Magnolia State has been ugly, weird, full of old grudges and fault lines, and new national rancor over the soul of the Republican Party. Now the contest has been thrown into a three-week runoff. Incumbent Sen. Thad Cochran received 48.9 percent of the vote Tuesday and his Tea Party challenger, state Sen. Chris McDaniel won 2,000 more votes to earn 49.6 percent. In Mississippi, if no candidate gets 50 percent of the vote, a run-off follows. That six-term Sen. Thad Cochran is in such trouble is a sign of how much politics has changed in the Tea Party era, and more proof that those grassroots conservative forces are healthy. In some states, like North Carolina and Georgia, GOP candidates have appealed to Tea Party voters and won despite the opposition of Tea Party elites who have backed other candidates. In Nebraska a Tea Party candidate won, but his credentials and political skill made him acceptable to establishment figures who want to win above all else. In Iowa, primary victor Jodi Ernst was supported by movement conservative organizations as well as the Chamber of Commerce. During the entire GOP primary season, much has been made about the brewing civil war within the Republican Party. But the races up until Tuesday managed, for a variety of reasons, to tamp down those differences. On Tuesday in Mississippi, the battle was joined. The clash between ideology and pragmatism there has been more pronounced than anywhere else, but it has been playing out through a distinctly local filter. There is nothing personally objectionable about the 76 year-old Cochran. Quite the opposite: courtly, kindly, and gentlemanly are a part of his clamshell packaging. He is an incumbent in a business where incumbents almost always get elected. And what would seem to make him healthier than Bob Bennett of Utah and Dick Lugar of Indiana--incumbents who lost to Tea Party-backed candidates in the last election cycle--is that if Cochran is re-elected he will have considerable power in a possible Republican Senate majority. His position on the Appropriations Committee could translate into money for his state that benefits more than others from the federal budget. Republican incumbents like Sens. Orrin Hatch, Mitch McConnell, and Lindsey Graham learned to reshape themselves in the era of Tea Party threats, but that's not what Cochran has done. He has been running as a man who has delivered for the state in the past--on everything from the farm bill to funding in the wake of Hurricane Katrina--and will deliver in the future. That very power, which used to make incumbents nearly invincible, is part of what made him vulnerable. McDaniel says that Cochran, once referred to as ""King of the Earmarks,"" is just the kind of politician who has grown the federal government and lost touch with the state's conservative principles. In the various GOP primaries we've seen this cycle, many of the fights have seemed contrived, but this one has the elements of a serious ideological debate about the size and role of government. Political scientists David Corbin and Matt Parks write about the Mississippi contest in the Federalist, saying that ""talk about restoring constitutional government is just that--until voters are willing to give up their place at the pork-barrel trough."" But if the Mississippi race is an archetypal Tea Party vs. establishment showdown from one angle, it also contains local spice--yet another warning against trying to neatly fit any race and its candidates into a pundit Mad Lib. The final weeks of the contest have been dominated by a bizarre back and forth over a surreptitious photograph taken of Cochran's wife, Rose, who lives in a nursing home where she has suffered from dementia for 14 years. The incident, chronicled by my colleague David Weigel, led to the arrest of McDaniel supporters and Tea Party activists. It was the fallout of a long-standing campaign by the candidates' supporters to inject questions about Cochran's fidelity to his wife into the bloodstream of the race. (Cochran shares a house with his assistant, Kay Webber, and travels regularly with her.) This episode led to an attack on McDaniel's character and counter-claims from McDaniel, who denies any involvement (and hasn't been linked to it). He and his aides say it is the Cochran campaign that is abusing the invalid Rose Cochran. The race at times has had the feeling of a hijacking. Cochran, who has been on a sort of high-stakes amble across the state in recent weeks, doesn't really seem to have his heart in it. He wanted to retire but was pushed to run again, say local insiders, because friends and allies implored him--he could do so much for the state given his seniority. As Cochran has hit the stump--the first time he has really had to actively campaign since 1984--the insistent claims by his supporters that he is campaigning vigorously only hangs a lamp on the fact that this is a campaign of a man from another generation who has had jumper cables hooked to him. Cochran's campaign has taken its toughness not from its genteel pinstripe-wearing candidate, but from local operatives who have been savaging McDaniel as unprincipled, untrustworthy and a tool of outside groups like the Club for Growth and the Senate Conservative Fund. It's not just the nursing home scandal, they insist, it's that McDaniel is slippery, shifting his positions on Common Core, tort reform, and federal aid for Hurricane Katrina victims. (Fact checks here and here.) McDaniel, almost half Cochran's age, is a hard-charging former talk show host who has welcomed outside forces who want to make him the sign of a Tea Party that is still alive and kicking. Sarah Palin and Rick Santorum campaigned for him in the final week, championing his support for ""constitutional government"" against the ""old guard."" They have a justified reason to celebrate their blow to the old-line GOP. ""They just want a scalp,"" says Haley Barbour, former two-term governor, whose nephews Austin and Henry are heavily involved in the contest. ""These outside groups don't care about Mississippi. They don't know Pascagoula from Pelahatchie. They just want a victory for their national political reputation."" That message isn't limited to Mississippi alone. The Republican Main Street Partnership, which is on the other side of the ideological battle from Tea Party groups, has tried to raise questions about candidate's local credentials when they have been supported by outside groups. In Mississippi both sides have benefited from outside help. Cochran's campaign raised about $3.6 million for the race; McDaniel's $1.2 million. But outside interests injected $8 million, including $4.5 million for McDaniel and $3.2 million for Cochran. What will those outside groups do now? Cochran will have a harder time in a run-off because McDaniel's troops are more committed and more likely to turn out for that vote in three weeks. His out-of-state donors, known for their passion, will be doubly so. Given that, the forces of pragmatism that have been backing Cochran have a dilemma. Do they keep supporting Cochran and attacking McDaniel, or do they step back, given that McDaniel could be the party's nominee and Democrats are anxious to use an ugly battle to tar the party more broadly? That might be the prudent thing to do, and a source in one big-money group that could help Cochran says they're not going to because the writing is on the wall. American Crossroads says it will not interfere in the race. The Chamber of Commerce, which has backed Cochran, will continue to do so, says a source, but the level of that future commitment has yet to be determined. Meanwhile, Henry Barbour, who runs the local super PAC helping the incumbent, seems ready for a fight. He tweeted, ""There will be a heavy reload on both sides...This race is about MS's interests vs outside groups who've hijacked the Tea Party & their flawed candidate."" But what about the candidate himself? Cochran sure doesn't seem jazzed about wading even deeper into the Mississippi mud."

21	21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/06/epa_emission_regulations_and_republican_obstructionism_the_gop_could_have.html	"Everywhere, Republicans are harrumphing about the Environmental Protection Agency's new emissions rules, which require power plants to reduce their carbon-dioxide emissions by 30 percent from their 2005 levels. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called the rules a ""dagger in the heart of the American middle class, and to representative democracy itself,"" while Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt promised to ""fight President Obama every step of the way to stop this unprecedented power grab."" Of course, as a rule issued under established powers for the EPA, this is the opposite of a ""power grab."" If Republicans are outraged by the announcement, they only have themselves to blame. It is true that in recent months, the administration has been vocal--even strident--about the danger of climate change. In February, for example, Secretary of State John Kerry derided global warming deniers as members of the ""Flat Earth Society"" who are ""burying their heads in the sand."" At the same time, the White House didn't begin with a regulatory approach. In 2009, President Obama threw his support behind climate legislation in the House, and the following year, a group of Senate Democrats--including Kerry--began work with Republicans to craft a bipartisan climate bill. The process fell apart, a victim of bad management from the White House, election year politics, an embattled and fearful Sen. Lindsey Graham--the South Carolina senator at the center of the negotiations--and the growing tide of Republican anti-Obama sentiment, which would culminate that fall with a huge GOP victory in the House of Representatives.* It's not that EPA action wasn't possible, but that the administration wanted legislation and would make key concessions to get it. In the absence of a law, however, the White House was prepared to act alone. ""If Republicans didn't respond to the proposed deals,"" wrote The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza, ""the White House could push them to the table by making a threat through the Environmental Protection Agency, which had recently been granted power to regulate carbon, just as it regulates many other air pollutants."" With a little cooperation, Republicans could have won a better outcome for their priorities. They could have exempted coal from more stringent spectrum of regulations, enriched their constituencies with new subsidies and benefits, and diluted a key Democratic priority. Instead, they'll now pay a steep substantive price for their obstruction, in the form of rules that are tougher--and more liberal--than anything that could have passed Congress. But this isn't the first time Republicans have sabotaged themselves. The entire story of Obamacare is a case study in the self-defeating futility of GOP obstruction. At various points in 2009 and 2010, Republicans could have transformed the Affordable Care Act. During the ""Gang of Six"" negotiations, when Sen. Max Baucus worked for months to win support from his GOP colleagues on the Finance Committee, Republicans could have won major concessions in exchange for their votes. That was true again after Scott Brown's win in the Massachusetts special election for the Senate. By beating Martha Coakley, Brown had cracked the party's filibuster-proof majority, giving leverage to Republicans and leaving Democrats shook from surprise. ""It is vital that we restore the respect of the American people in our system of government and in our leaders. To that end, I believe it would only be fair and prudent that we suspend further votes on health care legislation until Senator-elect Brown is seated,"" said then-Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia, calling for Democrats to hold off on further action. Likewise, conservative Democrats like Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska called on President Obama to restart the whole enterprise and look for broad, bipartisan solutions. With a single fig leaf of cooperation, Sen. McConnell could have broken the Democratic coalition for a comprehensive reform bill and dismantled the existing proposal. Had he and any other Republican been willing to play ball, they could have built a modest reform plan that left even more of the current system intact, forcing Democrats--and liberals in particular--to take less than half a loaf. Instead, the party doubled-down on its opposition. It refused to budge, and in doing so, gave Democrats time to regroup and recover their nerve. Which is what happened. And less than two months after Sen. Scott Brown ""doomed"" health care reform, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, creating a new wing of the American welfare state. Moreover, with its new taxes, new subsidies, and generous Medicaid expansion, it was larger and more liberal than it would have been in a world where Republicans--and not conservative Democrats--formed the right-most pole of debate and negotiation. Indeed, this dynamic--Republican obstruction leading to more liberal outcomes--has continued with the implementation of Obamacare. The law was designed with some decentralization in mind. Rather than a single national exchange for health insurance, lawmakers went with 50 individual exchanges, that states could run as they wanted. But, as Politico reports, a combination of technical problems and Republican obstruction have left us with the emergence of a de facto national system:"	How Republican Obstructionism Is Helping Liberals Make Their Dreams Come True	['Blunt', 'Nelson', 'McConnell', 'Obama']	[]
22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/06/bowe_bergdahl_court_martial_the_obama_administration_needs_to_let_the_army.html	"Acting as commander-in-chief, President Obama exchanged five terrorist leaders for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. The rationale was that the United States leaves no soldier behind on the battlefield or in enemy hands. That is half of the equation. The disconcerting other half is that Bergdahl may have left behind his own unit and gone over to the enemy. In 2009, then Pvt. Bergdahl (automatically promoted in absentia to the rank of sergeant) left his frontline unit under the cover of darkness. Soon after, the Taliban reported him in their custody. For weeks, thousands of American soldiers risked their lives to rescue him. Several of these soldiers have posted explicit, detailed accounts of their exhausting efforts, including the names of several Americans killed during the search or in its vicinity. U.S. military and civilian leaders have generally skirted the issue of whether Bergdahl deserted the army, as Secretary of Defense Hagel did again yesterday on Meet The Press. ""I'm not surprised that there are still questions,"" he said,  ""and until we get the facts exactly what the condition of Sgt. Bergdahl is, we can't go much further in speculation."" Hagel was deliberately evasive. Despite his ducking the question, Hagel knows that a lengthy investigation into Bergdahl's possible desertion has already been conducted, but not released to the public because Bergdahl was still in captivity. Hagel has that investigation. He knows what happened, as do the president and Chief of Staff of the Army. This ambiguity has put American officials in an awkward position. They are at once celebrating the return of an American captive, regretting the release of five American enemies, and uncomfortably hemming about how America and the Army should welcome back Bergdahl. A truthful response by the secretary of defense and other administration officials would have been better. Mr. Hagel could have said, ""We are grateful Bergdahl has been released. An investigation into his disappearance has been conducted. The United States Army, as his parent organization, will take the matter from here."" QED. That was all the administration should have said about the matter. Let the Army take care of its own. By waffling and insinuating that the Bergdahl episode closed on a high note with his return, the administration has politicized the event. The Bergdahl episode hasn't finished: It is just getting started. It won't be over until the Army determines whether Bergdahl deserted his unit, and whether he should be subject to court martial and punished. By any reckoning, the release of five dedicated Taliban terrorists was a high price to pay for the return of a single American captive. It will be a price worth paying only if the Army is allowed to live up to its own high standards. Left to its own procedures, the Army as an institution will proceed with a thorough judicial investigation. Most probably this will result in a court-martial. The evidence is too compelling to be ignored. If there is a finding of guilt, a judge may mitigate the sentence. But not to proceed with a judicial course would harm the integrity of the Army. There is a deep anger throughout the ranks about Bergdahl's behavior. The administration would be well advised not have anything more to do with Bergdahl. Let the Army system work. The Army can be trusted to follow the correct course."	The Obama Administration Needs to Let the Army Decide if Bergdahl Should Be Court-Martialed	['Obama']	[]
23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/06/bowe_bergdahl_and_negotiating_with_the_taliban_why_the_deal_to_free_this.html	"The news channels are blaring two misconceptions about the recovery of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who had been held captive by the Taliban for five years until this past weekend, when he was traded for five Guantanamo Bay detainees. First, contrary to claims by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers and others, the Obama administration did not negotiate with ""terrorists"" to get Bergdahl back. But, second, contrary to messages conveyed by President Obama and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, this is not an occasion for unblemished celebration. The first point is politically important. Many columnists and congressmen make a big point that America doesn't negotiate with terrorists. Well, sometimes America does, but the key thing here is that the Taliban delegates, with whom U.S. officials have been negotiating in Qatar over the fate of Sgt. Bergdahl, are not terrorists. They represent a political faction and a military force in Afghanistan; they are combatants in a war that the United States is fighting. In other words, Bergdahl was not a ""hostage"" (another erroneous term uttered by Rogers). He was a prisoner of war, and what happened on May 31 was an exchange of POWs. The United States and practically every other nation that's ever fought a war have made these sorts of exchanges for centuries. In recent years, American officers have turned over hundreds of detainees to the Afghan government, which in turn freed them in exchange for favors of one sort or another from the Taliban. During the Iraq war, American commanders frequently made similar swaps. The Israeli government (which can't be considered soft on terror) trades prisoners with Hamas and Hezbollah all the time. In the most dramatic case, Gilad Shalit, an Army private abducted by Hamas, was traded for 1,027 Palestinian and Arab prisoners, 280 of whom had been serving life sentences for terrorist attacks against Israel. The Israelis are particularly devoted to the commandment: Thou shalt not leave one soldier behind. The fate of Shalit was a national cause, his picture plastered on the walls of many Israelis' homes, and his release celebrated as a national holiday. This is a natural artifact of a small, extremely homogenous country where nearly everyone serves in the military and where bombs explode in local neighborhoods during wartime. American culture is very different. My guess is that very few among us remembered--or had ever heard of--Bowe Bergdahl until his release made headlines this weekend. Still, the U.S. military cherishes this same principle (leave no soldier behind), and his recovery is cause for satisfaction--but not much more than that. One difference between this case and many others is that Bergdahl wandered off his base. He wasn't abducted or captured while on patrol. Rather, on the night of June 30, 2009, he simply got up, took his compass and a few other supplies (though not his weapons), and walked away. It's not clear why. (After he's nursed back to health, an Army investigation will presumably find out.) In a lengthy 2012 Rolling Stone article, Michael Hastings painted a picture of Bergdahl as a moralistic home-schooled adventurer, enticed by the romance of do-good soldiers (he tried to enlist in the French Foreign Legion), who studied Pashto, took the nation-building doctrine seriously, grew disillusioned with the Army's mission and disgruntled by his own unit's incompetence--and walked off into the mountains. On the other hand, Nathan Bradley Bethea, a retired Army captain who served in the same battalion, recalls Bergdahl--in the Daily Beast and a BBC interview--as a mentally unstable misfit who should never have been allowed to join the service. Either way (and the two portraits aren't mutually exclusive), Bethea is probably right that soldiers from Bergdahl's own unit ""died trying to track him down."" Not in some Saving Private Ryan-like search, but aircraft and drones were probably diverted from normal military tasks in the hunt for Pfc. Bergdahl, leaving several units unprotected in the process. (He has been promoted to sergeant, for service, during the years of his captivity.) Again, this is what servicemen and women do for comrades lost in harm's way; it's part of their mission, a vital aspect of military culture. But it's a bit less noble, it feels more like a burden than a duty, when the lost soul got lost on his own free will, when he deserted his post and abandoned his fellow soldiers--whatever the reason. And so, it felt a bit discordant when Secretary Hagel made a victory lap around Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan, proclaiming, ""This is a happy day, we got one of our own back."" And, though more understandable, it seemed a bit excessive, as well, when President Obama called it ""a good day"" while standing before the White House press corps alongside Bergdahl's parents. (A low-profile photo-op might have been more appropriate.) There are a couple more misconceptions in this saga. First, while Obama and his diplomats made the deal on their own (in line with his powers as commander-in-chief), it's not true that he left Congress out of the picture. He briefed a small group of senators in January 2012, when a deal first seemed in the offing. Sen. John McCain reportedly threw a fit, objecting that the detainees to be released had killed American soldiers, but after talking with John Kerry (at the time, still a senator and a friend), came around to the idea. (This may be why McCain, though displeased with the detainees' release, is not raising his usual hell in public appearances now.) Second, it's not the case--at least if things work out as planned--that the five detainees, some of whom were high-level Taliban officers in their younger days, will go back and rejoin the fight. The deal requires them to remain in Qatar for one year; after that, Americans and Qataris will continue to monitor them--though it's not yet clear what that means; in the coming days, someone should clarify things. There's one more potential bit of good news. This whole exercise has demonstrated that the Taliban's diplomatic office in Qatar does have genuine links to the Taliban high command. (A few years ago, when fledgling peace talks sputtered and then failed, many concluded that it was a freelance operation unworthy of attention.) And the fact that the exchange came off with clockwork precision (see the Wall Street Journal's fascinating account of how it happened) suggests that deals with the Taliban are possible, and that a deal signed can be delivered. Spokesmen for both sides stressed that the deal just made was a prisoner-exchange deal and nothing more--that no further inferences should be made. But American officials from President Obama on down have stressed that a good end to this war can only be a negotiated end, that it must involve an accord with all the factions, and the Taliban are a homegrown faction. Maybe the Bergdahl deal will serve as a prelude to a wider set of talks--in which case this will be looked back upon as a very good day."

24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/republican_leadership_conference_the_gop_s_speakers_lineup_is_a_problem.html	"The Republican Party has a lot of problems, and if there's one that doesn't get enough attention, it's the party's broad appeal to provocateurs, faux martyrs, and grifters. Just look at the speakers list for the Republican Leadership Conference, which began on Thursday. There's Donald Trump, the man who made ""birtherism"" a national cause; Herman Cain, whose presidential run was a glorified book tour; Dinesh D'Souza, who just pleaded guilty to a felony campaign finance violation, and Phil Robertson, the Duck Dynasty star who--like Cliven Bundy--believes black Americans were better off under racist oppression. In fairness, I'm sure Robertson despises slavery. (Bundy, by contrast, wondered if blacks weren't ""better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things."") He just thinks it wasn't so bad under Jim Crow. ""I never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person,"" said Robertson, discussing his childhood in Louisiana. ""The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I'm with the blacks, because we're white trash. We're going across the field. ... They're singing and happy."" But whereas Bundy was condemned by every Republican under the sun-- ""Bundy's comments are completely beyond the pale,"" said Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee--Robertson became a conservative hero. Of course, the main difference is that Robertson got in trouble for his views on gays. ""Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men,"" he said. On the right, this language isn't beyond the pale. Or at least, it's seen as a matter of religious expression, not bigotry. As such, conservatives defended Robertson as a victim of political correctness and religious intolerance. At National Review, Mark Steyn compared anti-Robertson activists to Soviet totalitarians: ""Everything must be gayed. There must be Five-Year Gay Plans for American bakeries, and the Christian church, and reality TV."" Louisiana Rep. Vance McAllister brought one of Robertson's sons to the State of the Union. At this year's Conservative Political Action Conference, Robertson was celebrated and Sarah Palin canonized him for conservative America. ""His fight was our fight and we pushed back and we won. And now everyone is happy, happy, happy,"" she said. If all of this sat in equal proportion to serious policymaking, it wouldn't be a big deal. Annoying for liberals, but not a cause for concern. Unfortunately, in our world, the energy of the conservative movement--and thus the Republican Party--is geared toward these people. If you want money and attention, you could do worse than become a conservative provocateur. Right-wing resentment--stoked by impossible promises and harnessed through donations--built a fortune for Glenn Beck, a political career for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, and a burgeoning media empire for the late Andrew Breitbart. Even if you think these lawmakers and activists are sincere--and I do--it's hard not to see the whole operation as a perpetual swindle. Take the Affordable Care Act. With the re-election of President Obama, odds of repeal were slim-to-none. But rather than abandon the call for Obamacare repeal, conservative groups--and their allies in Congress--pushed further. Not because they thought it could happen, but because it was lucrative. As Robert Costa described for National Review at the time, ""Business has boomed since the push to defund Obamacare caught on. Conservative activists are lighting up social media, donations are pouring in, and e-mail lists are growing."" The message from groups such as the Senate Conservatives Fund was simple: You can repeal Obamacare! All it takes is a few friendly donations. Indeed, on its donation page, Heritage Action for America--the political arm of the Heritage Foundation, a right-wing think tank--asked supporters to ""Please donate now to ensure we have the resources to fight and win."" Every political movement has its opportunists, and there's no doubt the Democratic Party has its share of grifters. But MSNBC doesn't devote its commercial programming to selling gold, and failed Democrats aren't running for president to drive their book sales. Simply put, there's a huge market for grift on the right, and--aside from the ethics of it all--it's a huge problem for the GOP. Like with Bill Clinton in 1992, the election of Barack Obama in 2008 turned a lot of conservatives into easy marks for the worst provocateurs, who made millions with wild rumors and apocalyptic predictions. In turn, there's a generation of Republican politicians who aren't as interested in policy as they are in building clips for a gig on Fox News. As we saw with the GOP presidential primaries, it's impossible to keep this from the general public. Eventually, mainstream Republicans will have to affirm extreme ideas (i.e., ""self-deportation"") to pass muster with the conservative base, and in the process, hurt themselves with ordinary voters. If Republicans want to avoid this for the next election cycle, they should ignore the Cains and D'Souzas of American politics. After all, the only thing worse than listening to grifters is encouraging them."	Why the Republican Party Attracts Provocateurs, Faux Martyrs, and Grifters	['Costa', 'Clinton', 'Obama']	['gay']
25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/hillary_clinton_s_hard_choices_the_former_secretary_of_state_s_new_book.html	"T-minus 12 days and counting until June 10, when Hillary Clinton launches her campaign. That's the date of the release of her book, Hard Choices, though the campaign has really already begun. On Wednesday a video was posted to the book's Facebook page in which Clinton explained what she was trying to say. The day before, her publisher released the Author's Note. Last week Simon & Schuster released a video in which Clinton discussed the writing process. Two weeks ago an excerpt ran in Vogue in which Clinton talked about her mother. The day before Clinton's book hits stores, Diane Sawyer will sit down to interview the former secretary of state. And on and on the caravan will go. (Modern Dog magazine may have rights to the canine passages.) It's hard to know whether this rollout and the book tour that follows are part of a campaign to sell Clinton's book or the start of her presidential campaign--or if there is any difference. Any politician who writes a book when she still has an election ahead of her is writing a campaign book, and since the book is being launched with the precision and stage management of a modern presidential campaign, we should probably just treat it as the launch of Clinton's White House bid and not kid ourselves. As Mark Leibovich pointed out, campaign books are as thrilling as a moist towelette. Our expectations should be low. But based on what Secretary Clinton has said about the book so far, she has ambitious goals. She is going to explain the world and America's place in it (something the president is trying to do these days, too). She'll offer a behind-the-scenes view of decision-making in the Obama administration, empathize with the tough decisions people make every day, offer reflections on domestic issues like ""the cancer of inequality,"" and demonstrate how, by coming together, Americans can make their own hard choices. Can any book achieve all of that? We'll see. The distance between the claims Clinton is making for the book and what's actually delivered will likely mirror the gap at the heart of modern campaigns. Candidates seek to define themselves first and make sweeping claims about what they will deliver, but then when it comes to the task, they often don't. The biggest disappointment will be if the book is a grand sleight of hand. By naming the book Hard Choices and repeating the title again and again in a public relations blitzkrieg, it will anesthetize people into believing that hard choices were made and that Clinton is the hard-choice-maker, but never actually wrestle with the hard choices in the text. In 2008 Clinton made the case that she was the most experienced candidate in the race. Her famous campaign ad, in which she asked if Barack Obama would be able to answer a 3 a.m. emergency phone call, was the most evocative part of this claim. But in truth Clinton had no experience answering those late-night calls either. When she told the story of landing in Bosnia under sniper fire as first lady, it turned out to have been an exaggerated claim. Now Clinton has no shortage of experience. She is presenting herself as a choice-maker--a smarter version of the ""decider""--and making that attribute do a great deal of political work for her. ""Keeping America safe, strong, and prosperous presents an endless set of choices, many of which come with imperfect information and conflicting imperatives,"" she writes in her Author's Note. Arguing that you know how to make decisions is a good place to start if you're running for president. That's what presidents do all day. As every president and White House staffer will tell you: No easy decision comes to the president's desk. The decisions are thorny because, as President Obama put it to Michael Lewis, ""Any given decision you make you'll wind up with a 30 to 40 percent chance that it isn't going to work. You have to own that and feel comfortable with the way you made the decision. You can't be paralyzed by the fact that it might not work out."" It stands to reason that you would want to have someone in the office who has made those kinds of decisions and understood the complexities of doing so. (Of course, Obama didn't have that experience before he got the job.) In her Facebook video, Clinton argues that, knowing how to make decisions abroad, she's ready to take on the difficult ones at home. ""Choices is (sic) at the core of what kind of people we want to be and what kind of countries we want to have,"" she says, explaining the message of her book. ""And I think that's especially true here in our own country at this moment in our history, because I do talk about some of the hard choices we face ... here at home, to deal with the cancer of inequality, to give people in our country the ladders of opportunity that have always been a hallmark of the United States and the American dream."" Does decision-making have this transitive property? Governors with no foreign policy experience certainly hope so. So do CEOs who run based on their decision-making ability in the corner office. Clinton also suggests that the choices she made in office are similar to the kinds of choices people make in their daily lives about their marriages, jobs, and children. Decision-making as an opportunity to make an empathetic connection with voters appears to be part of Clinton's purpose--making her years as America's top diplomat dealing with something Americans don't care much about (foreign affairs) into something personal and relatable to their daily lives. Nowhere did Clinton make this pitch harder than on The View, when she appeared to say farewell to television legend Barbara Walters. ""I want Americans ... to really feel in our hearts that the most important thing is how we treat each other and how we think about the future and the future for our children and future grandchildren. And that means we've got to be kinder and we have to be more compassionate and empathetic and mindful. That's not the usual language you use when you're talking about things like relations with Ukraine or Russia or China or whatever. But it all starts from home. Just like who you are as a person, it all starts from your heart, and so you have to carry that forward."" Though Hillary Clinton's book is about her experience traveling to 112 countries, the ultimate destination is the home, the heart, and the ballot box."

26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/texas_republican_runoffs_the_state_gets_redder.html	"Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst was pro-gun, anti-tax, anti-illegal immigration. He opposed the Common Core education curriculum. He'd run for Senate in 2012, attempting to find some space to Ted Cruz's right, accusing the eventual victor of being soft on illegals and red China. He had attempted to shut down Sen. Wendy Davis' 2013 filibuster of a bill that banned abortions after 20 weeks; he then excoriated the ""Occupy Wall Street tactics"" that helped Davis eventually win and helped crush her in a special session to pass the bill. Last night, Dewhurst was buried in a 65-35 landslide by a challenger who had branded him as too liberal. State Sen. Dan Patrick ran as the ""grass-roots"" candidate, one who would not compromise as much as the three-term incumbent. ""I'm not going to appoint Democrats to half the chairmanships in the Senate,"" he promised in his final debate with Dewhurst. ""I'm an unapologetic Christian first, I'm a grass-roots conservative second, and I'm a Reagan Republican third."" And on that same debate stage, he ticked off his greatest accomplishments as having ""put 'In God We Trust' in the Senate, 'Under God' in our pledge, passed the sonogram bill."" The life of the Tea Party, and the question of whether the five-year-old movement is ""dead,"" has been complicated by Texas' primaries. It's true that some of the national organizations that helped elect Cruz faltered and overpromised this year. They simply didn't commit the resources to help their high-profile candidates for Congress. But at the state and local levels, conservatives looked at Texas and saw plenty of slow-moving prey, lazy and marbled with fat. Gov. Rick Perry was retiring after 14 years in office, which created a first-in-a-generation attempt to move up the ladder. Attorney General Greg Abbott would easily win the nomination to replace Perry, which freed up his office. The state's land commissioner, agriculture commissioner, and railroad commissioner were all making lunges at Abbott's or Lt. Gov. Dewhurst's jobs, which freed up their own. What was at stake? Just the usual--the soul of the Republican Party and an attempt to more tightly define what a candidate could and could not say if he ever expected to win an election in Texas. In 2009, when the Obama wave shrunk the GOP's numbers in the Legislature, Democrats teamed up with Republicans to oust a conservative speaker of the house and elevate a more moderate candidate named Joe Straus. He's held on since then, through solid 2010 and 2012 Republican wins, and this year he defeated a Tea Party primary challenge in his own district. To the terror of the Republican establishment, the base found other targets. In February, when I traveled around the state to cover the faltering challenges to Sen. John Cornyn and Rep. Pete Sessions, some donors were already panicking that Abbott would be replaced by one of two far-right candidates. Abbott had never been a liberal, but he'd been strategic, and like Cornyn before him (since Reconstruction, only two Republicans have been attorney general of Texas) he'd become a kind of ringleader of conservative state attorneys general. Now he'll likely be replaced by Ken Paxton, a right-winger who'd once unsuccessfully challenged Straus for speaker. Paxton ran this year as Sen. Ted Cruz's Sancho Panza, running one campaign ad that consisted of nothing but Cruz praising him in a speech. (Cruz, who did not officially endorse Paxton, smiled when I asked him about the ad and pronounced it ""an acknowledgment of the energy and the passion of the grass roots."") In another ad, Paxton characterized fellow candidate state Rep. Dan Branch's vote for a campaign finance transparency bill as a way to provide ""special privileges to labor unions that backed Obama."" He was buoyed by support from the National Rifle Association and Texas Right to Life, the latter group claiming that Branch ""tried to expand"" abortion in Texas because he'd wanted to allow late-term terminations of unborn children with unsurvivable organ damage. Why settle for that when you could settle for Cruz's candidate? Cruz, who wasn't on the ballot, had a terrific primary season. The victorious nominee for railroad commissioner had run as the Cruz candidate; but then, so had the loser. The freshman senator had only really endorsed one candidate, a veteran of his 2012 campaign named Konni Burton, and she won her runoff by more than 20 points. ""Konni loves God,"" said Cruz at a March rally for Burton's Senate campaign. ""Konni loves the Constitution, and Konni loves liberty."" Konni will have friends in the Texas Senate. Conservatives had gone after Sen. John Carona, too, a Republican who'd once said of his colleagues that ""fiscal responsibility means nothing to them"" and ""they only worry about the next primary."" Real estate investor Don Huffines narrowly bested Carona in a primary, after an in-person endorsement from Sen. Rand Paul--Huffines had endorsed his father's presidential bid. Democrats, who have not won a statewide race here since Nelson Mandela was president of South Africa, started this election cycle with grand Texas dreams. They really could not have asked for a better ticket to run against. They openly pleaded for Republicans to bail them out, maybe to give an opening to their lieutenant governor candidate Leticia van de Putte, by nominating Patrick and Paxton. Dewhurst artlessly pointed this out in the final debate. ""One of the things I saw in our polling,"" said the lieutenant governor, ""is that if you inform voters about both of us, they move toward me."" Dewhurst was wrong, of course, and few people in either party will miss him. But Democrats could take only cold comfort in his loss. Yes, he had gaveled down Wendy Davis; he had presided over a bill that was shuttering abortion clinics. And he had just lost to Dan Patrick, who pronounced Dewhurst insufficiently passionate about life. ""Planned Parenthood is in the business of taking babies' lives and making a profit,"" said Patrick on the debate stage. ""I don't care if every Planned Parenthood in America goes out of business. In fact, that would be a great goal. More babies would live."""	Can Texas Get More Red Than This?	['Abbott', 'Perry', 'Cornyn', 'Cruz', 'Nelson', 'Obama']	['god', 'abortion']
27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/presidential_attributes_and_pew_research_center_poll_americans_rarely_vote.html	"What qualities do voters want in a president? A white male Protestant lawyer of European descent from a big state has been the historical answer, but the Pew Research Center recently asked this question to get a more current view. The results were bad news for the Senate's class of presidential hopefuls, such as Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Marco Rubio. Republican Party voters like governors--and just about nothing about the Washington political system in which today's senators serve. But there's good news for those candidates too: Voters don't base their vote on the attributes they say they want. For a long time, voters preferred members of Congress to governors. In 1987, 66 percent of voters in Pew polls said experience as a member of Congress provided better preparation for the White House, while just 22 percent said serving as governor was preferable. In 2007, congressional experience was still preferred by more than 2-to-1 (55 percent to 24 percent). Now, after two presidential terms of a former senator, the governors are making a comeback. Forty-four percent of the public says that serving in Congress better prepares someone to be president while as many say serving in a governor's mansion is better preparation. If you're a Republican, it's genuinely better to have been a governor. Republicans, by a 51-to-40 percent margin, say serving as a governor rather than as a member of Congress is a better warm-up for the presidency. It's often said that GOP voters prefer governors, but in 2007 more Republicans believed experience in Congress (46 to 32 percent) was the best training ground. It would be novel if voters revised their opinion because they had an epiphany about the skills required for the presidency. Instead, the shift is almost certainly another manifestation of voters' hatred for Washington. Thirty percent of respondents in the new Pew poll said they would be less likely to support a candidate with ""many years"" of experience as an elected official in Washington while just 19 percent would be more likely. That's a flip from seven years ago when more than twice as many saw lengthy Washington experience as a positive. Despite the recent lionization of LBJ and his legislative success, people don't want candidates with the kind of experience that Johnson had. Sens. Cruz, Paul, and Rubio could be discouraged about running for president--if voters hadn't been so consistent about ignoring the things they say they want in a president. In the 20 years voters have said they preferred congressional skills to gubernatorial ones, America has elected three governors to two four-year terms--Reagan, Clinton, and Bush. Gubernatorial skills didn't get more popular, but they clearly weren't an impediment to office either. In early 2007 voters placed military experience at the top of their list of attributes they said would make them more likely to vote for a candidate. That didn't help veteran John McCain. Tea Party voters find military service particularly appealing. Seventy-one percent say it would increase the likelihood they would vote for a candidate. Yet Tea Party conservatives were some of McCain's harshest critics. A version of the same was true for business experience and support for Mitt Romney among Tea Party members. Rep. Paul Ryan is the only possible presidential candidate who has ""many years of experience"" in Washington--precisely the kind of attribute Tea Party voters dislike so much--and yet, as a Tea Party favorite, he would almost certainly be forgiven for it. The reason these questions about attributes tell us so little is that voters make their ultimate decisions based on other factors. The biggest reason voters pick a candidate is their party orientation (perhaps as much as 85 percent of the vote is determined by that alone, say political scientists). Then voters weigh a candidate's policy positions and make assessments of his or her character and integrity. If a candidate thinks the way I do about a policy or appeals to my values and emotion, I am likely to assume that he or she can do the job. ""Do I trust this guy to solve this problem,"" asks University of Missouri political scientist John Petrocik, imitating a voter's thought process. ""Something he says makes me trust him. I know he'll deal with an issue because he's saying things that I agree with, which makes me know he cares about it the way I do. Just talking about an issue persuades people that you are going to be able to do something."" In the corporate world, a hiring committee would look at a candidate's attributes to see if he or she had the skills for the job they were being asked to perform. It might make sense if presidential campaigns worked this way, too. But while voters have opinions about such matters, they just don't act on them."

28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/koch_brothers_explained_the_billionaire_libertarians_are_in_the_spotlight.html	"The ""movie premiere"" wasn't supposed to happen at all. Instead, it happened a little late. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi both endorsed a screening of Koch Brothers Exposed: 2014 Edition in one of the basement rooms of the Capitol Visitors Center. Republicans spied a possible ethics violation--how could this movie, an hour of agitprop from Robert Greenwald's Brave New Films, not be ""political""? The screening wasn't canceled. Nobody had enough to gain from canceling it. Instead, on Tuesday night, Brave New Films set up chairs and a screen and waited for late votes to end in Congress so their special hosts could show up. To bide time, Greenwald showed the first scenes from his movie. Rapid-fire scenes of poverty alternated with images of fancy cars and champagne. The Koch brothers' combined wealth, $81.4 billion, was offered as another symbol of this inequality. Two hurried-looking cartoons of Charles and David Koch shoved dollar bills into a funnel, which spurted its contents into piggy banks named Americans for Prosperity ($32 million) and American Future Fund ($13 million) and Center to Protect Patient Rights ($114 million). Beneath all of this, a pounding synthesized soundtrack that resembles what Batman might hear when he's in hot pursuit. But to soften the tone, there was the voice of Jim Hightower, the Texas politician-turned professional liberal. He twanged out some zingers about ""the Koch boys"" and how ""even a dog knows the difference between being stumbled over and being kicked."" ""What I hate about narration is the voice of God,"" Greenwald told me. ""You know--I know better than you do, the voices on those documentary channels that put you to sleep at night. Hightower's got that amazing voice and he manages to take ideas and put them in a folksy, more human way."" He's got competition. Koch Brothers Exposed is being released right before Citizen Koch, a Kickstarter documentary by two frequent collaborators of Michael Moore. The Greenwald screening happened the very same day that Sons of Wichita: How the Koch Brothers Became America's Most Powerful and Private Dynasty was released. Mother Jones editor and first-time author Daniel Schulman spent three years writing it, which allowed him to beat Koch biographer Chris Leonard to the shelves. And everyone's competing with a media that's devoting resources to Koch stories and a Democratic campaign infrastructure that's investigating the Kochs as if they were candidates. The response from the Kochs falls a little bit short of what a combined net worth of $81.4 billion could buy. Ever since 2010 stories in New York and The New Yorker alerted America to the influence of the Kochs, Koch Industries has run a pugnacious press shop--KochFacts--that insists on correcting the record when the Kochs are blamed for a particular evil. There's just so much ""record"" to correct now, and only so much time. Elaine Lafferty, an author who got to know Kochworld spokeswoman Nancy Pfotenhauer during her stint on the McCain-Palin campaign, is writing a book with the Kochs' reported participation. And the tone of that work got previewed in an exclusive 2010 story Lafferty wrote after Jane Mayer's New Yorker profile of the Kochs. ""The news alert that a businessman with a personal net worth estimated at nearly $18 billion might wield political influence seems to have shocked, shocked, the media,"" wrote the future court biographer. But that book is way off on the horizon. There are less than six months to go before a midterm election that the Democrats have made, largely, about the Kochs. They are writing the story, and their incessant framing of the Kochs has inspired a little media derision and a lot more heat. On Tuesday, when Pelosi, Reid, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders finally got to the Greenwald screening, they celebrated the progress so far. ""Keep wages low,"" said Pelosi, summing up the ""personal aggrandizement"" behind the Kochs' campaign spending. ""Stop regulation of clean air, clean water. Climate issues. All of those things are harmful to our planet, to our workers, to our children's future. That's why when people hear the name, Koch brothers, it has a negative connotation by 2-1."" Libertarians and Republicans generally posit two responses to this. One: The left has its own tycoons, like environmentalist and hedge funder Tom Steyer. Two: Unlike those tycoons, the Kochs don't want anything from the state, like that Steyer guy who wants his investments in solar panels to pay off. (They do talk a lot about Tom Steyer.) The Kochs' actual motivations are both shadowy and almost poetically simple. Schulman's book, which is carefully researched and exquisitely told, traces the family's ideology and fortune to patriarch Fred C. Koch. It's true, as Greenwald's film reports, that the elder Koch got rich off a $5 million contract building oil-cracking stills in the Soviet Union. He never pretended otherwise. He returned and became an ally of the John Birch Society, writing A Business Man Looks at Communism and becoming obsessed with the red threat. ""What I saw there convinced me of the utterly evil nature of communism,"" Koch wrote in a 1964 letter to the Washington Post. Koch, as seen by Schulman, becomes comically Manichean. ""When you contrast the state of mind of Germany today with what it was in 1925,"" Koch once wrote, ""you begin to think that perhaps this course of idleness, feeding at the public trough, dependence on government, etc., with which we are afflicted is not permanent and can be overcome."" It might be important to note that he wrote that the month after the signing of the Munich Pact. Koch's sons, who build the business into an empire, were more idealistic yet less naive. ""What I find interesting is how misunderstood their politics actually are,"" said Schulman in an interview. People seem to think they're traditional Republicans, but their ideology is libertarian. Charles Koch back in the late 1970s was slamming the business community for seeking corporate welfare, while at the same time advocating against welfare for the poor. He thought it was the worst kind of hypocrisy. It's interesting to see him and David be embraced by Republicans--I think the Democrats did a lot to legitimatize the Kochs in the eyes of Republicans who had been wary of them."" Indeed, the Kochs spent decades working outside of traditional party politics. David Koch ran for vice president as a Libertarian Party candidate for the same reason Charles Koch considered the Republican Party dead-ended. The Kochs went on to seed think tanks such as the Cato Institute, the Mercatus Center, the Reason Foundation. (Disclosure, I worked at Reason magazine, published by the foundation, from 2006 through 2008.) They also funded activist groups like Citizens for a Sound Economy, but did relatively little to aid Republicans. (CSE eventually split into Dick Armey's FreedomWorks and the Kochs' Americans for Prosperity.) The reason, teased out by Schulman, seems to be that they did not consider what they did to be traditional rent seeking. Yes, Koch organizations lobbied hard against the Clinton-era BTU tax that was going to cost the industry. Yes, the industry was better off in the low-regulation Reagan era than in the Clinton years, when it kept getting ensnarled in investigations. But for years, the brothers seemed content to spend on think tanks and lobbying. Schulman points out that the Kochs' policy conferences, now heavily protected affairs from which muckrakers fight to obtain secret documents, started out as snoozers. The first, a 2003 confab in Chicago, attracted just 17 people. They only picked up when Richard Fink, the Kochs' in-company political guru, ""began to spice up the tedious conferences with conservative celebrities and high-profile Republican lawmakers."" The Republican Party's base had moved right, as had its political class--in no small part because of the influence of the research funded by the Kochs. The people hired by the Kochs to understand politics urged the brothers further and further into the arena. It worked, in part, because the brothers were so unspecific in their goals. In his 1980 acceptance speech at the Libertarian convention, Koch called the party the ""best hope for human freedom since the American Revolution."" Thirty-one years later, having helped install a Republican majority in the House of Representatives, he told ThinkProgress reporter Lee Fang that it was ""probably the best grassroots uprising since 1776."" The Libertarian Party's agenda was, as Democrats have rediscovered, far more radical and specific than anything modern Republicans were willing to say.  But once the brothers' ideology became populist, and once it had allies in mainstream politics, they had minimized the threat of profit-killing reform and regulation. Getting to that point took decades. Start counting from Fred Koch's trip to Russia, and it took nearly 90 years--start counting from the brothers' first stabs into politics, and it took nearly 40. For almost all of that time, their goals and their story were obscure. They'll never be obscure again."	Are We Finally Learning Who the Koch Brothers Really Are?

29	29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/05/school_lunch_program_in_the_agriculture_bill_house_republicans_want_rural.html	"As the school year winds down, it's not all playoffs and picnics, as poor families across America suddenly face a math challenge of their own--how to stretch an already inadequate food budget to cover summer months without school breakfast and lunch programs. According to more and more lawmakers, all these families truly need from government is a heaping plate of friendship washed down with a tall, cool glass of harsh, judgmental love. But tough as it is to manage on subsidized meals, the fact is, it's a lot harder to manage on nothing. And there is a lot more nothing to eat for American kids today than there once was. This week, the House of Representatives is hard at work marking up its version of an agriculture appropriations bill that sets funding levels for school and summer nutrition programs. Though the bill is currently known as the ""Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act,"" it's becoming clear that if some House Republicans had their way, they would like to call it the ""Hungry, Healthy-Free Kids Act."" The new object, at least in the House, is to ensure that less food, and less healthy food, finds its way to fewer kids. The Senate version of the bill is on track to ensure that poor kids' basic food needs continue to be met, in the summer as well as the academic year. But the House version, and the attendant debate over children and food in America, is depressing. The agriculture bill establishes funding for some of the Department of Agriculture's basic nutrition initiatives, like WIC (the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children) and the school lunch and breakfast programs. These tend to be the rare programs in which high public approval and gut-check instincts actually match up with reality--it both feels right (WIC boasts a staggering 72 percent public approval rating) and is actually true that when families can access WIC, mothers and young children get food they can't get elsewhere. It also makes sense and is actually true that malnourished kids face serious health and development risks, which cost the country a whole lot more in the long run. And it's also actually true that when children have access to school breakfast and lunch programs, they get better grades and require less discipline. It's all simple math, right? During the academic year and the summer. But how do you solve for X when you also have to factor in the Big Food Industry's profit margins, a belief in some circles that healthy food is a luxury, and the burgeoning claim that ""urban"" poverty is a ""values"" problem whereas ""rural"" poverty is just bad luck? The House plan confounds the simple math in a few truly terrible ways: The first one may seem like small--er--potatoes, but it would represent a significant shift if it makes it into the final package. WIC, celebrating its 40th anniversary this year, was designed to provide nutrition and breastfeeding support to low-income pregnant women and mothers of young children. It's one of the best safety-net programs available. The qualifying ""basket"" of foods recipients can buy reflects years of research on what may be lacking from their diets. As it happens, white potatoes haven't been among these recommended items--not because potatoes are unhealthy, but because they're usually pretty well-represented in the diets of, well, most everyone in the United States already. As you can imagine, Big Potato is not happy with that science-based, data-driven conclusion. And yes, Big Potato is a thing. And also, Big Potato is filled with well-fed lobbyists who demanded language in the agriculture bill that puts white potatoes firmly in the WIC basket, so that from now on, the data driving nutrition policies will come with dollar signs. But fries are just a side dish, right? The real red meat of the House's pushback on feeding hungry kids has to do with the National School Breakfast and School Lunch programs. And once again, the summer meals programs are coming under attack. These are on-site breakfast or lunch plans tied to enrichment programming for kids while they're out of school. Many of the families who take advantage of these programs already rely on support from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families subsidies to stretch budgets through the school year (programs that are perpetually on the chopping block themselves). Summer meal programs are as rational and effective for low-income families as school lunches; not only in providing consistent meals for hungry kids, but also in pairing those meals with structured, supervised activities, which helps working parents keep kids occupied when school is out. They also connect marginalized families to their communities to stave off some of the isolation that comes with serious poverty. So what's the problem? The overall summer program has come under scrutiny since its inception in 2010, even though it is quite small in comparison to the school breakfast and lunch plans, only feeding about one in every seven kids who need the meals program during the school year. This year the Obama administration asked Congress for an additional $30 million to help it do better than that by piloting some strategies to connect more kids to summer meals. Feeding hungry kids? It's a gimme, right? But the House plan not only reduced the pilot's appropriation by 10 percent to $27 million, it also just announced plans to limit the program to benefit only ""rural area"" school districts, which will actually be limited even further to rural Appalachia. Nowhere are we told why the urban/rural distinction matters for hungry kids, although you are certainly free to guess. (Hint: ""Rural"" regions may tend to vote Republican and contain fewer minorities.) Beyond the dog whistle suggesting that ""urban"" poor are less worthy than the rural poor lies data showing that the distinction is absurd. There is tremendous need in impoverished rural areas--in southwest Virginia, for example, about one in every four kids lives in poverty. But in ""urban"" Petersburg and Richmond, that number rises to nearly one in every three kids. And families are no less needing of food assistance when kids are home from some of the worst-performing schools in the Commonwealth. Republicans purport to be responding to a greater need in rural areas. But depending who you count and how you count, urban areas actually have more households in need than rural ones, so both areas need to be targeted, and both areas deserve the opportunity to focus on improving the number of kids these programs serve. Underpinning the ugliness of the debate about feeding hungry kids, in both summer and winter months, and in both urban and rural areas, is a presumption that these kids are somehow unworthy because their families are also unworthy. The urban/rural silliness is just the tip of the iceberg. Last winter, Republican Rep. Jack Kingston of Georgia suggested that maybe students should have to sweep the floors before getting free lunches. In March, Paul Ryan announced that the federal government was giving hungry children ""a full stomach and an empty soul."" Each time a school throws a lunch out to protect children from poverty, an angel somewhere must lose its wings. Finally, there is the question of whether poor kids are undeserving of healthy food: When the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act was signed into law by President Obama in 2010, part of the law sought to increase nutrition standards for school lunch and breakfast programs, as part of first lady Michelle Obama's fight against childhood obesity. The law was written to take effect in 2014. So now, to get federal funding for certain food programs, school divisions need to show compliance with these nutrition goals, including more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, as recommended by the USDA. Already, 90 percent of schools have come into compliance with these healthier nutrition standards, but the House bill would require the USDA to establish waivers to exempt school districts that claim the higher standards are too expensive and that the kids allegedly toss everything green out. Since most schools are already compliant and we know that whole grains are healthier than refined ones, these waivers aren't really about giving schools time to get the new standards right; they're an excuse note written by the Big Food Industry folks that will allow schools to just keep serving (or start serving again) food high in salt, sugar, fats, and every other obesity- and illness-inflaming ingredient that can be stacked onto a beige plastic tray. And jump back, Nanny-Staters. It's not as though these new nutrition standards are mandating a menu inspired by Goop. Science shows that the introduction of more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains makes kids healthier, and teaches lifelong lessons about healthy eating. The argument that some kids don't eat some of the healthy foods so they should be served junk is no different than saying that kids who don't like to read shouldn't be allowed to borrow from school libraries. Food is food and children are children and hungry kids are hungry kids. House Republicans can slice and dice that equation any way they want, but urban and rural kids both need to be fed, and they need to be fed during the academic year and also in summers. More urgently, all kids deserve healthy and nutritious food, not just rich ones. No matter how you do the math, the cost of childhood obesity and hungry kids is too high to bargain away a law that works."
