On Friday, the Obama campaign released a video taking credit for the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden. Republicans denounced the video. The Republican National Committee issued a statement from Sen. John McCain calling it a ""pathetic political act of self-congratulation"": Shame on Barack Obama for diminishing the memory of Sept. 11 and the killing of Osama Bin Laden by turning it into a cheap political attack ad. ... Barack Obama is not only trying to score political points by invoking Osama Bin Laden, he is doing a shameless end-zone dance to help himself get reelected. No one disputes that the president deserves credit for ordering the raid, but to politicize it in this way is the height of hypocrisy. The statement appeared on the RNC's website rather than McCain's, a clear sign that the RNC orchestrated it. Other Republicans joined in the outrage. Sunday morning on Meet the Press, former RNC Chairman Ed Gillespie, now an adviser to Mitt Romney, quoted the McCain statement and called Obama ""one of the most divisive presidents in American history. He took something that was a unifying event for all Americans ... and he's managed to turn it into a divisive, partisan political attack."" When David Gregory pointed out that President Bush had used the same tactics in 2004, Gillespie replied that Obama, unlike Bush, crossed a line by suggesting ""that Gov. Romney wouldn't have done"" what Obama did in the Bin Laden case. According to Gillespie, Republicans in 2004 simply depicted Bush as ""a strong leader. You don't see him saying, 'and that guy [John Kerry] would have done something different.' "" Really? Let's go back and look at the 2004 campaign. Let's see what McCain, Gillespie, and other Bush surrogates said about Kerry, Iraq, and Saddam Hussein. In December 2003, U.S. forces captured Saddam in Iraq. He had been hiding in a hole in the ground. Two months later, as Kerry began to wrap up the Democratic presidential nomination, Gillespie, who was then the RNC chairman, embarked on a media tour to brand Kerry a wimp. Here's Gillespie on CBS in February 2004: ""If his policies were in place, Saddam Hussein would not only be in Baghdad; he'd still be in Kuwait."" And on CNN: ""If his policies were in place, Saddam Hussein would not only be in Baghdad today, he'd still be in Kuwait, and we would not be waging an aggressive war against terror."" And on NBC: ""If John Kerry had his policies in place today, Saddam Hussein would not only be in Baghdad, he'd be in Kuwait."" And on Fox: ""If his policies were in place today, Saddam Hussein would not only be in Baghdad, he'd be in Kuwait."" And at a Republican dinner: """"If Sen. Kerry's policies were in place today, Saddam Hussein would not only be in Baghdad, he would still be in Kuwait."" And so on. That summer, Gillespie turned the Republican National Convention into a martial victory parade. Speaker after speaker bragged that Bush had defeated, deposed, and captured Saddam--and that Kerry couldn't be trusted to make such tough calls. ""We have captured or killed hundreds of al-Qaida,"" Vice President Dick Cheney crowed. ""In Iraq, we dealt with a gathering threat and removed the regime of Saddam Hussein. ... Tonight he sits in jail."" Cheney went on: ""Time and again, Sen. Kerry has made the wrong call on national security. ... America needs and America has a president we can count on to get it right."" Introducing Bush at the convention, New York Gov. George Pataki reminded voters of the hole in which Saddam had been found: ""President Bush understands we can't just wait for the next attack. We have to go after them, in their training camps, in their hiding places, in their spider holes."" The convention's keynoter, Sen. Zell Miller, D-Ga., used Saddam's capture to smear Kerry: ""As a war protester, Kerry blamed our military. As a senator, he voted to weaken our military. ... President Bush is committed to providing the kind of forces it takes to root out terrorists, no matter what spider hole they may hide in."" McCain, the main speaker on the convention's opening night, hailed Bush's courage: ""He ordered American forces to Afghanistan and took the fight to our enemies, and away from our shores, seriously injuring al-Qaida and destroying the regime that gave them safe haven. ... President Bush made the difficult decision to liberate Iraq. ... We need a leader with the experience to make the tough decisions and the resolve to stick with them."" Romney, in his speech, argued that Kerry lacked this toughness: ""I don't believe Sen. Kerry is the leader our country needs. ... He's campaigned against the war all year, but says he'd vote yes today. I don't want presidential leadership that comes in 57 varieties."" And Bush, in his acceptance address, described the loneliness of making the call to take down Saddam: ""I faced the kind of decision that comes only to the Oval Office."" When you look back at this record of boasts and taunts, it's amusing to hear Gillespie, Romney, and McCain whine today about the political exploitation of military decisions. Their accusations of hypocrisy are hypocritical. Their cries of shamelessness are shameless. But Gillespie is right that Obama's tactics don't quite match Bush's. At their 2004 convention, Republicans did two things Obama hasn't mustered the chutzpah to try. First, they assigned a major speaking role to Tommy Franks, the general who had overseen the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. Franks used his prestige as a war hero to recommend a vote for Bush over Kerry: ""I choose George W. Bush because he is a leader we can depend on to make the tough decisions--and the right decisions."" Second, the convention featured a speech by Bernard Kerik, the police commissioner of New York City (who later pleaded guilty to tax fraud), in which he declared: I think of the courage it took for our commander in chief to land on an airstrip in the dark of night, a world away, to be with our troops on Thanksgiving. He was there for them as he was for us right here in New York City, inspiring a nation as he stood on hallowed ground, supporting the first responders. This fight against terrorism takes decisiveness, not contradiction. ... There are two candidates in this race, but only one fills those needs. This tribute wasn't for Bush's decision to launch the war, or for capturing Saddam. It was for spending two hours serving and eating dinner with U.S. troops at the Baghdad airport. The visit took place six months after Bush, standing in front of a ""Mission Accomplished"" banner, had declared a successful end to major combat operations. Kudos to Bush for visiting the troops. But risking your life for a quickie morale booster--or making the risk look, in retrospect, bigger than it really was--isn't one of those difficult calls we hire a president to make. It isn't like, say, sending a team into Pakistan to kill the guy who hit us on 9/11, when you know that a Carter-style helicopter fiasco will sink your presidency. Is Obama using his Bin Laden gamble, and its success, to score political points? You bet. Is he cynical to imply that Romney, in the same situation, wouldn't have done the same thing? I think so. But, please, let's not hear such complaints from the people who spent 4,000 American lives and $1 trillion to get the wrong guy--and then played the patriotism card all the way to re-election.

2	2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/04/newt_gingrich_plans_to_drop_out_of_the_republican_primary_race_.html	"One year and one month ago, the space shuttle Discovery completed its 39th and final mission. The moment it hit the ground, it was retired. Thirteen months into its obsolescence, NASA shelled out $11 million to strap it to a plane and fly it to the Smithsonian. Countless Washingtonians, plenty of whom had forgotten all about the shuttle, stood outside to gawk and film and Instagram the graceful final descent. Newt Gingrich was taking notes. Today he announced that he will ""transition"" his presidential campaign into a nonpresidential campaign. The final descent will occur on Tuesday, at a speech in Washington. ""It'll be impressive,"" predicts his unofficial biographer Craig Shirley, author of two books about Ronald Reagan. ""He's always been able to pull off a big, impressive speech."" And it'll all happen a year after the city pronounced Gingrich politically dead. Gingrich has given us this time so that we might reflect on how he ran for president, and what it did to him. How can he recover from a presidential bid that won in two out of 43 states? In one of the early Newt pre-obituaries, the Atlantic's Molly Ball reflected on Gingrich's high-paying Fox News gig (""that bridge has been burned""), his old American Solutions and Center for Health Transformation think tanks (""defunct""), his campaign account (""nearly $4.5 million in debt""), and his torso (""noticeably fatter""). That empire won't be rebuilt, not the same way at least. But is Gingrich really in worse shape now than he was in 1998, when he started laying bricks for the think tanks and consulting gigs? He didn't get sacked by his own party. He lost a national primary that no one seriously thought he could win. The mid-2011 Gingrich collapse proved that the pages of Politico bulged with former associates trashing the guy. Can he come back as a Republican adviser? He'll still be living in McLean, Va., limo distance from any Republican who wants to tap him for advice. If a CNN guest spot can turn Hilary Rosen into an ""Obama adviser,"" whose opinion every Democrat had to answer for, a future, freelancing Gingrich can make himself relevant in the exact same way. ""In this day and age,"" suggests Shirley, ""anybody can be rehabilitated. I mean, anybody."" (Shirley's Citizen Newt has been delayed for a 2013 release; the narrative, he says, will probably end with the 1994 election instead of the 2012 ""footnote."") Can Gingrich make money again? If he sticks to his May 1 drop-out date, he will get seven days off before he starts touring To Make Men Free: A Novel of the Civil War. (It was originally published in a limited run as The Battle of the Crater, which accidentally gave it the sound of a story about the moon, but that didn't move the e-books.) His politics books are published by Regnery, which has no incentive to stop buying them. At the start of this campaign, Callista Gingrich was seen as a strange, mute curiosity. She's now--go ahead, laugh--a reasonably successful children's book author. The next Gingrich renaissance might already be under way. He always claimed to be running on ""ideas,"" concepts big and bold that would save the future for his grandchildren. Some of these ideas made sense. The moonshot: We know why Gingrich's ""moon colony"" speech in Florida hurt him. Tautology was one reason--it sounded silly, so it was covered like it was silly. Fiscal policy was a reason, too--Tea Party voters retched at anything with the word ""spending"" in it. But what Gingrich really proposed was taking $2 billion from NASA's budget and awarding it to private sector space innovators. All Gingrich did was overreact to the critics and bungle the explanation. ""If I had been clever,"" Gingrich told Jeffrey Goldberg this week, ""I would have said to Romney, 'You would have fired Christopher Columbus and John F. Kennedy because they were proposing daring and large things.'"" (He'd used the line before, but we're giving him credit for ideas, not zingers.) Training sessions for bureaucrats: Starting last summer, Gingrich would tell any captive audience about Lean Six Sigma--a martial-arts-patterned efficiency program. Supercommittee wasn't working? Implement Lean Six Sigma. Need to cut $500 billion in waste per year? Make federal employees take Lean Six Sigma training. ""A properly focused Lean Six Sigma effort,"" he'd say, ""could reorient government to act in ways that would help balance the budget, grow our economy, accelerate job creation, and make America the most competitive country in the world."" Perhaps it wouldn't get all of that done in one go. But Gingrich eventually massaged the idea into mandatory training for new hires under new presidential administrations. That doesn't happen now. Instead, we have to wait a year or two for Ron Suskind to reveal how the new hires screwed up. Deepening the port of Savannah: This might have been a small idea, but it reflected one of the big ones. Gingrich, hated by some conservatives because of his late 1990s deal-cutting, was the only Republican candidate keen to admit that government might, on occasion, need to spend money on things. Specific things. It was Gingrich who originally moved earmarking power from appropriators to individual members of Congress. At his high point, Gingrich even suggested that the role of a president should be to speak infrequently and delegate power--the legislators would know what to do. ""Pious Baloney."" Not on the same plain as the other ideas, sure, but has anyone come up with a better description of Mitt Romney's biological defense mechanisms? At the Jan. 8 debate in New Hampshire, Romney suggested that he retired from the Massachusetts governor's office only because he wanted to be a citizen again. ""Could we drop a little bit of the pious baloney?"" erupted Gingrich. ""You have been running consistently for years and years, and then suddenly citizenship showed up in your mind."" Gingrich excelled at debates. They were, he admitted, the reason he was able to stay in the race past the summer of 2011. (Sheldon Adelson's giant checkbook came later.) He was a fine pundit and a horrifically flawed candidate. He'll never be a candidate again. Problem solved."	Newt Gingrich Had Some Good Ideas. No, Really!	['Romney', 'Kennedy']	[]

Last week during a press conference in the Rose Garden at which he called for more policing of oil-trading markets, the president said ""we use more than 20 percent of the world's oil and we only have 2 percent of the world's oil reserves."" That's almost identical to a statement he made last month, when he said that no matter how much drilling is done here, domestic reserves won't ""get much above 3 percent. So we're still going to have this huge shortfall."" Obama has the numbers right. But he's wrong about what those percentages mean, and his wrongness reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the oil and gas industry. While it's true that America's share of total global oil reserves is just 2.2 percent, the United States produces about 9 percent of the world's oil, making us the world's third-biggest oil producer, behind only Russia and Saudi Arabia. How can we have relatively little reserves on paper, yet continue to produce so much oil? The answer is both simple and somewhat confounding: The more oil we find, the more oil we find. In 2010, America's proved oil reserves stood at 31 billion barrels, just slightly below the 33.8 billion barrels of proved reserves the United States had in 1990. But over that two-decade period, the domestic oil sector produced about 52 billion barrels of oil. In other words, between 1990 and 2010, the United States produced nearly twice as much oil as we believed the whole country had in 1990, and yet at the end of that period, we still had about the same amount in proven reserves. What's going on? In a word: innovation. And few industries on the planet have been as innovative as the American oil and gas sector. It's not the size of your reserves that counts, it's what you do with them. And the U.S. oil and gas sector has been remarkably proficient at exploiting this country's vast mineral wealth. Over the past century or so, oil and gas drilling has gone from a business dominated by wildcatters armed mainly with a hunch and a prayer to one where the latest seismic and ""geosteering"" technologies allow drillers to steer their bits so accurately that they can arrive within inches of their target zone two miles (or more) beneath the Earth's surface. Add in ongoing improvements in horizontal drilling--and yes, in hydraulic fracturing, the bugaboo of many environmental groups--and the changes are easily seen. For instance, over the last five years, Southwestern Energy, a Houston-based company drilling in the Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas, has halved the number of days it takes to drill an average well while nearly tripling the amount of gas it gets during the initial phase of production. Southwestern has done it by tweaking the fracturing process while more than doubling the length of the horizontal segments, so that more of the well is in contact with the source rock. These improvements are allowing drillers to extract enormous amounts of both oil and gas from rock formations (like shale) that only a few years ago were thought to be uneconomic. The result: Drillers are unlocking vast quantities of hydrocarbons and in doing so, they are adding lots of new reserves. As one veteran driller told me recently, companies are having to deal with what he calls ""crappy rock."" But he quickly added the good news: ""there's a whole lot"" of crappy rock that contains oil and gas. As a result, we see the same kind of numbers when it comes to domestic production of natural gas, the cleanest of the hydrocarbons. The United States sits atop only 4.1 percent of the world's natural gas reserves. But the United States is, by a wide margin, the world's biggest gas producer. In 2011, the nation produced a record quantity of the fuel, some 23 trillion cubic feet, or about 20 percent of the world total. Compare that performance with Iran, a country that sits atop 16 percent of the world's known gas reserves (only Russia's reserves are larger) and yet produces just 4 percent of the world's natural gas. In fact, as recently as 2009, Iran was a net natural gas importer. Obama has repeatedly made the claim that ""clean"" energy is the way of the future. But the president dares not admit the obvious: Over the past few years, the oil and gas sector has out-innovated the political darlings of the moment: solar and wind energy. Four years ago this month, natural gas prices were over $10. Today, the price is about $2. Despite all of the hype--and billions of dollars in subsidies doled out to solar and wind energy projects over the past few years--the clear reality is that horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing and the incremental production gains that have resulted from them, have resulted in a tidal wave of new natural-gas production that is pricing wind and solar energy out of the market. Boone Pickens, once of the wind sector's biggest boosters, says wind projects need $6 natural gas to be competitive. Pickens also recently said ""I've lost my ass"" in the wind business. If anyone doubts how the shale revolution has changed the domestic oil and gas sector, they need only visit Midland, Texas, a town that is in the midst of an unprecedented boom. New construction is visible all around the city. Truck traffic is constant. And much of that construction and traffic is to support surging oil and gas production from geologic zones like the Sprayberry and Wolfcamp that were thought to be uneconomic just a few years ago. Arlen Edgar, who's been in the drilling business in Midland since 1973, says the previous boom back in the 1980s ""was crazy, but this is crazier."" About 500 drilling rigs are now working in the Permian Basin near Midland, and that is creating lots of new jobs as well as a surge in production. In January, oil production in Texas was 1.6 million barrels per day, the highest level since 1994. Overall U.S. oil production is also climbing rapidly. Indeed, the shale revolution has so fundamentally changed the global energy equation that last month, analysts at Citigroup led by Ed Morse predicted that U.S. oil production could exceed that of Russia and Saudi Arabia within the next three years or so. That's an innovation story that President Obama should be celebrating, not ignoring."	America Has the Most Innovative Oil Industry in the World. Why Doesn't Obama Appreciate That?	['Obama']	[]
4	4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/04/mitt_romney_says_that_executive_experience_is_the_quality_that_matters_most_.html	"Marco Rubio is this year's Sarah Palin. As a possible vice presidential pick, he is popular with the grassroots. He is an envoy to a key part of the electorate and has crossover political appeal. He has successfully bucked his party establishment, and those who have seen him work say he's skilled. He's an easy and talented campaigner, and he'd wow them in Tampa the way Palin did in St. Paul, Minn.* He is also fundamentally at odds with his potential running mate's message and criteria for his vice president. Mitt Romney is the candidate of executive experience. It's not just that he was a ""business guy"" for 25 years. He was a business guy who made tough decisions. He told us this often during the primaries. Romney's key critique of President Obama is that he lacks such experience. In evaluating possible veeps, Romney has said, above all else, he wants to pick someone who can step into the job if necessary. That means Romney's No. 2 must have the same kind of experience--or at least some of it. Maybe just a hint? A thimble? Marco Rubio, at age 40, has none. (Unless someone counts two years as a part-time city commissioner.) Mitt Romney isn't the only one who praises executive experience. Republicans have long heralded that quality. It's why so many Republicans liked governors and former governors like Mitch Daniels, Chris Christie, and Jeb Bush. Lamar Alexander cited the quality in his endorsement of Romney. So did Sen. Ron Johnson.* It was perhaps the talking point for the various legislators and luminaries who have endorsed Romney. Gov. Christie, who is often cited by Republicans as the party's expert on leadership, goes on about the executive temperament rather extensively: ""Let's be very leery, very wary of sending another member of Congress to the White House. Now see members of Congress, they can be OK, but they don't know the first thing most of the time about using executive authority. They don't know the first thing about getting things done."" Experience making tough calls was the key criteria George W. Bush used to pick Dick Cheney. Yesterday, Cheney, who has been involved in several vice presidential selections, offered his views: ""The single most important criteria has to be the capacity to be president."" Cheney said ""talking heads"" will call for a vice presidential candidate who's a woman, Hispanic, or who is from a ""big state."" ""Those are interesting things to speculate about .... It's pretty rare that the election turns on those kinds of issues."" Not only is Cheney agreeing with Nate Silver about the politics, but on the merits he would seem to be ruling out Marco Rubio. You can mount a strong argument that no life experience prepares you for the presidency. Abraham Lincoln, our greatest president, had a relatively thin resume with zero executive experience. (He had even less legislative experience than Rubio and unlike Rubio never rose to be speaker of his legislature.) Problem: This is not the case that Romney has made. He's made the opposite case. Of course, Romney does have an out. One of the truths of vice presidential searches is that if you want the job, you should say you don't want it. The other is that candidates can change the criteria they set for the job when they pick someone who doesn't meet them. That is what John McCain did with Sarah Palin. During the primary race, McCain prized foreign policy experience above all else. A top attack line against Romney in the opposition file was ""Mitt Romney has no foreign policy experience."" It was also McCain's knock against Obama that he lacked any experience with the wider world. Then McCain picked Palin, who had more executive experience than Barack Obama but no real foreign policy experience, so never mind all that. Romney has less room to throw his previous convictions overboard, since his opponents have regularly argued that he has a penchant for disposable conviction. One of the open questions of this election is whether voters unhappy about the economy care about this kind of thing. If so, it's bad news for Romney. In the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, Romney trails the president on whether he is consistent and stands up for his beliefs (41 percent to 30 percent) and being honest and straightforward (37 percent to 30 percent). Regardless of whether Romney has any intention of picking Sen. Rubio, the courtship offers plenty of political benefit for both men. Rubio gets to raise his profile as a national figure. Romney can ingratiate himself with Florida voters who presumably won't mind the association (and who perhaps won't remember the mean things Romney's spokesperson used to say about Rubio when she worked for one of his opponents). Hispanic voters might be more open to the idea of a Romney candidacy if he shows himself to be carefully considering the softer immigration ideas of a Republican of Cuban heritage. Picking a vice president is the only presidential-level decision Romney will get to make before Americans vote in November. Romney has argued that his business career gives him special insight and leadership abilities. There are only a few ways to test this thesis. Evaluating his jobs record as a businessman turned governor is one, and evaluating how he makes his first top-level personnel decision is another. Romney has shown a laudable ability to ignore the day-to-day madness of the presidential cycle, keep his eye on what's important. Romney may face his toughest test yet in avoiding the allure of Marco Rubio. Corrections, April 25, 2012: This article originally stated that Palin wowed conservatives with a speech in Denver. It was in St. Paul, Minn. (Return to the corrected sentence.) Also, because of an editing error, this article originally misidentified Sen. Ron Johnson as Tim Johnson.

Dick Clark was dead at 82, felled by a ""massive heart attack."" Because I follow TMZ on Twitter, I got the newsbreak at 3:31. Because a lot of the people I follow also follow TMZ, Clark's death was announced, analyzed, and (sorry, this is Twitter) joked about for 20 minutes. At 3:52 pm, the CNN app on my iPhone blurped and announced a message: Television personality Dick Clark, the longtime host of ""American Bandstand,"" has died, a publicist says. Two minutes later my phone shook again, startled by an alert from USA Today. BREAKING NEWS: Dick Clark legendary TV entertainer, dies at 82. Twenty-four minutes after the TMZ scoop, and this was breaking? How's that supposed to work? Does ""breaking news"" have any meaning anymore? Nope, almost none. I realize that the universe hardly needs another article about how social networks have Changed Everything. Sorry, universe: Facebook, Twitter, chats, and microblogs have Changed Everything. Anyone who's online can learn news before national news channels report it. The proprietors of Facebook, Twitter, and microblog accounts know this, and they abuse their power like children suddenly placed into the cockpits of battle droids. Do not judge these children, because they had terrible teachers. ""Breaking news"" is an old concept, codified by the Associated Press in 1906 when the wire wanted to designate ""news of transcendent importance."" The AP used the term ""FLASH."" Other news-breakers used ""bulletin,"" ""alert,"" whatever gave off the right ""stop editing the crossword and print this"" vibe. Something important had just happened. This news service had confirmed it. Now you knew. This system was abused, obviously, and the misuse of ""breaking"" ramped up with the birth of cable news. We should cleave TV from the rest of the media--the Internet doesn't need to be blamed for all the sins of harried 24-hour news merchants. But TV and the Internet got drunk on ""breaking"" on the same day. It was Sept. 11, 2001. Three cable networks and an evolving blogosphere had a story that changed minute-to-minute, with confusing details and rumors out of nowhere and, eventually, a hot war in central Asia. Constant ""breaking"" news alerts made sense in those weeks. And then the news cycle slowed down. The TV channels shrugged and kept using ""breaking"" and ""alerts"" at a greater pace than ever. ""It got trivialized and people couldn't unring the bell,"" says Craig Allen, a professor at Arizona State and a historian of TV news. ""It's just horrible now. We've got TVs on the wall I walk past in the morning. My eye is trained to notice a 'BREAKING' alert and pay more attention. So is yours. But half the time I see an alert, and it turns out it's somebody announcing an announcement of an announcement of a news conference."" On Thursday morning, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., I engaged in a random test of the modern cable news ""breaking"" regime. You've probably already forgotten about Thursday morning. There were no surprises or celebrity deaths or arrests of bathroom-prowling senators. And yet between Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC, I watched 19 news ALERTS explode across my Vizio. At 9 a.m., the Fox show America's Newsroom began with an ALERT about ""new details in the Secret Service scandal."" The details had been broken by other media hours earlier.  At 9:07 a.m., Fox ALERTED me that something had ""just crossed the wires""--a lousy jobless report, 386,000 new claims, coming out of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. At 9:59 a.m., Fox ALERTED me to the static scene outside the Air and Space Museum, where the space shuttle Discovery would eventually be escorted to its resting place by some astronauts. One minute later, I got an ALERT that ""the White House has issued an ultimatum to Paul Ryan."" Absolutely none of these things were breaking news. Hours later, MSNBC's Alex Wagner interrupted her show twice with ""breaking news here of a plane that went down off the coast of Florida."" This was breaking, sort of, in the sense that NBC's reporters were getting the details themselves. But it was local Florida news masquerading as national news. And this was all before Fox News gave itself over to a high-speed car chase in Texas. (Disclosure: I'm a paid contributor to MSNBC, but this has no bearing on whether car chases are national news. They are not.) Why does it matter if cable news alert standards have been watered down into pointlessness? Does the rest of media abide by their rules? No, they don't, but they copy these rhythms anyway. If you've got a Twitter account or a blog, you can add ""BREAKING"" to news that 1) isn't new or 2) didn't actually come from you or 3) both. Yes, some news is uncovered by hard-nosed 24-year old reporters in the Pittsburgh metro area. But you can claim that anything is ""breaking,"" even if you had nothing to do with ""breaking"" it. On April 9, ThinkProgress assigned the ""BREAKING"" tag to a story about George Zimmerman launching a website about his case, even though NBC News noticed it first. ""I try to use BREAKING when something is genuinely new,"" explains Judd Legum, who runs ThinkProgress's Twitter account. ""This can sometimes mean that ThinkProgress is first with the story, but can also just indicate that story was recently broken by another outlet. Determining what's recent I think is more of an art than a science. I do think it has become overused and cliched and I'll cop to being part of the problem sometimes."" Cliches get to be that way because people adore them. ""Breaking"" is a cliche because it's fun to sprint up the watchtower and take credit for the news. The new, abused style of ""breaking"" has been perfected by BreakingNews.com, a startup (part of MSNBC.com, now) that aggregates the news that just broke somewhere else. Nearly 4 million people follow it on Twitter, getting that little hiccup-thrill that comes with BREAKING news based on the decisions of 12 people working in New York, Seattle, and London. On Friday, they got alerts like ""Mystery disease kills 19, sickens 171 others in central Vietnam; country asks WHO for help in investigation"" and ""Mali's ex-president Amadou Toumani Toure arrives in Senegal nearly 1 month after coup, Senegalese state radio reports,"" and ""Bahrain's Crown Prince says canceling Sunday's Formula 1 Grand Prix 'would just empower extremists,' "" all alerts credited to other sources. ""We can't independently verify everything run by a news organization,"" explains BreakingNews general manager Cory Bergman, ""but we can cross-reference what's running on different ones."" Let's go back to the Dick Clark example. BreakingNews beat the AP to the news. How? ""We saw TMZ tweet their news immediately, but we waited for a second source, and we got it when KABC in Los Angeles reported it."" It's like the old Mr. Show sketch about the station with reporters who find out where other reporters are breaking news, and hold up their microphones to ""bring it exclusively to you."" It probably reads like I'm sitting in judgment, with a portrait of Joseph Pulitzer on my left and a Poynter questionnaire on my right. I'm not. I do the exact same thing as the phony Breakers when I retweet or excerpt some news. Everybody on Twitter does. The only difference--and again, we're leaving aside honest-to-God scoops--is between the people using ""BREAKING"" sarcastically and the sources that use it seriously, special sauce to get more clicks and eyeballs. ""I do use 'exclusive' if I want to stress the point we had something first,"" offers Ben Smith, the editor of BuzzFeed. ""But 'breaking' has always felt redundant to me. Why write something old?"" Well, one reason to do it is to stimulate the lizard brain and get people to think you've got some original news. A few weeks ago, in some midpriced hotel in some primary state that Mitt Romney was about to lose, I flipped on the TV and saw a screaming blue chryon: BREAKING NEWS. I braced myself. My reward: Absolutely nothing. Regular programming was over for the night and I was watching an infomercial about some snake oil that would improve my sudoku scores. The full chyron was ""BREAKING NEWS: Boost Brain Power and Memory Naturally."" The show was a parody of a real TV show, with an unthreateningly attractive host interviewing an unthreateningly attractive doctor. The ""breaking"" tag was a joke. As it should be."

This line was widely interpreted as a not-so-subtle dig at Mitt Romney, the wealthy son of a wealthy father. At first glance, that seemed plausible, though perhaps too subtle. The president's campaign would like you to think Romney was born with silver tea, soup, demitasse, grapefruit, and runcible spoons--not to mention that funny silver ladle we use just on Thanksgiving--in his mouth. But upon second look, the president wasn't talking about his Republican challenger. He was just talking. The ""silver spoon"" construction is a standard Obama cliche. He's used it here, here, here, here and here, long before Romney was the nominee. His wife has used it. (The press has even used the cliche  when talking about the president.) This was not a new chapter in the protracted battle over which candidate is out of touch. Instead, it is another frivolous but unimportant campaign moment as defined by our easy-sort campaign coverage system. Proof of this verdict is that Mitt Romney quickly took successful umbrage with Obama's comment when a helpful news personality placed the ball on the tee and handed him the bat. ""I'm not going to apologize for my dad's success, but I know the president likes to attack fellow Americans. He's always looking for a scapegoat, particularly those that have been successful like my dad, and I'm not going to rise to that."" Perfect: media misinterpretation and umbrage, two of the key ingredients necessary for the political silly season. And it's only April."	Did Obama Just Take Another Swipe at Romney's Riches?

This was true of the eventual nominees in the last election, and the one before that, and in every other presidential contest going back to 1916. One hundred years ago, two of the four men running for president were proudly hirsute, as were two of the four vice-presidential candidates. Today, the sitting president can't grow whiskers and his challengers wouldn't dare try. When did the beard lose its political prestige? In his delightful 1930 monograph Concerning Beards, Edwin Valentine Mitchell notes that ""the fortunes of the beard have always fluctuated through the ages. It flourishes for a time in full splendor, then diminishes in size, and finally disappears altogether, only to burst forth once more in all its former glory."" In much of the premodern era, a healthy beard connoted influence and high status; Mitchell says that ""one ancient king actually made a terrible scene because the reigning head of another state sent a beardless youth upon a political errand to his court."" The opposite is true, too: Men pressed into servitude were often shorn of their beards as a sign of subjugation. By the time of the Revolutionary War, facial hair had gone out of style in America, explains Victoria Sherrow in her Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History. And, indeed, the first 15 U.S. presidents were beardless, though John Quincy Adams did sport a rather nice pair of muttonchops. A sign of the times: In 1830, a man named Joseph Palmer was jailed for a year in Fitchburg, Mass., after fending off four men who attempted to forcibly rid him of his widely loathed beard. (Palmer's gravesite is marked with a monument that reads ""Persecuted for Wearing the Beard."") In the mid-1800s, whiskers made a comeback in American political life--or, as Reginald Reynolds put it in his odd 1950 volume, Beards, ""a beard was becoming almost as necessary as a Bible to a rising demagogue."" Abraham Lincoln began his presidency as a baby-faced rube from rural Illinois, governing a country on the brink of collapse. After growing a beard at the behest of a schoolgirl, he vanquished the South and passed into legend. Every subsequent president up to William Howard Taft wore some sort of facial hair, except for Andrew Johnson, who was impeached, and William McKinley, who was assassinated. If you wanted the Republican Party's nomination, a beard was as necessary then as a Reagan fetish is now. That changed in the early 1900s, likely due to the advent of the Gillette safety razor, which debuted in 1903 and eased the performance of what had long been a hated and bloody chore. Soon thereafter, the military banned beards, as they interfered with the seal on gas masks. By 1930, Edwin Valentine Mitchell would write that, ""In this regimented age the simple possession of a beard is enough to mark as curious any young man who has the courage to grow one."" In politics, that's been the case ever since. No sitting president has worn facial hair since Taft. Charles Evans Hughes was the last bearded major-party presidential nominee; he lost to Woodrow Wilson in 1916. Today, it's received wisdom that candidates should be clean-shaven. ""Except for a brief window from Sept. 11 to 2003-2004, most of the last 15 years in politics have been about change, and a wizened graybeard doesn't really convey change,"" says Jeff Jacobs, creative director and founder of NextGen Persuasion, a campaign consultancy firm. ""In 500 campaigns I've almost never had a conversation with a candidate about whether or not to have facial hair,"" explains Democratic media consultant John Rowley. ""It's almost like conventional wisdom about facial hair has already hit candidates before they even run."" The beard's absence from modern American politics can be partially blamed on the two scourges of the 20th century: Communists and hippies. For many years, wearing a full beard marked you as the sort of fellow who had Das Kapital stashed somewhere on his person. In the 1960s, the more-or-less concurrent rise of Fidel Castro in Cuba and student radicals at home reinforced the stereotype of beard-wearers as America-hating no-goodniks. The stigma persists to this day: No candidate wants to risk alienating elderly voters with a gratuitous resemblance to Wavy Gravy. A few politicians have managed to win elective office in spite of their hairy visages. Moderate, beard-having Ohio Republican Steve LaTourette has been a House stalwart since 1995. Who liked Rep. David Obey's beard? The voters of Wisconsin's seventh district did: They elected its wearer to 21 consecutive terms before Obey retired in 2011. Sen. Tom Coburn sometimes wears a beard, and its occasional appearance is eagerly awaited by Hill types. Coburn's beard even has its own tribute Twitter account, which boots up whenever the senator's whiskers begin to sprout. (Sample tweet: ""i've asked tom to spend a few minutes combing me before tonight's #SOTU, i must maintain my supple virility."") But mostly, a list of contemporary bearded politicos is a roster of the inept and inessential. There's former New Jersey governor Jon Corzine, who's currently embroiled in a massive financial scandal. Florida Rep. Alcee Hastings was impeached and removed from office while serving as a federal judge in the 1980s. Ex-New York governor David Paterson's three-year tenure did much to improve the fortunes of Saturday Night Live. Cantankerous Alaska congressman Don Young, known as ""Mr. Pork,"" has seemingly been ostracized from the beard community. (""Young is kind of a disgrace to beards around the world,"" wrote one member of a beard-centric message board). The oddly bearded jurist Robert Bork is the only person in the last 40 years to have his Supreme Court nomination rejected by the Senate. Ben Bernanke is the first beard-wearer to chair the Federal Reserve; he is currently one of the most-loathed men in America. Sometimes, a beard makes it seem like a politician is either emerging from or embarking on a three-day Smirnoff bender. ""A lot of times people associate beards with what happens after you lose a campaign and you let yourself go,"" says Jacobs. Indeed, one need only picture a dazed, broken Al Gore circa 2001, puffy and bearded like a white-collar woodsman gone to seed, to understand why politicos identify facial hair with failure and shame. There are other negative connotations, too. ""One misperception is that somebody who has a beard is lazy and can't be bothered to shave, sort of on par with somebody who's too lazy to brush his teeth,"" says Phil Olsen, the founder and self-appointed captain of Beard Team USA, who would know. ""Some people perceive beards as disrespectful."" When I asked John Rowley if he could think of a circumstance when he might actually advise a candidate to grow facial hair, he paused for a few seconds. ""Maybe when people have a lot of scars on their face from an accident,"" he finally answered. Barring a surge in the number of disfigured men running for office, voters shouldn't expect the political beard to re-emerge anytime soon. Because the real reason most candidates don't have beards is because most men don't have beards, and there's nothing to be gained by deviating from the mainstream. ""Candidates get criticized mercilessly on what their appearance is, so they go to great lengths to get a political uniform down that isn't too distracting,"" says Rowley. Which makes sense: The last thing a candidate wants is for his crazy beard to distract from his sober, rational message about living on the moon. And yet, though beards might not be all that common, they're actually well received among the general population. ""I do a lot of work with visual communications, facial expressions, how people read faces,"" says Jeff Jacobs. ""Facial hair poses no distraction or causes no aversions whatsoever."" Academic research bears this out: In a 1990 paper for the journal Social Behavior and Personality, J. Ann Reed and Elizabeth M. Blunk reported ""consistently more positive perceptions of social/physical attractiveness, personality, competency, and composure for men with facial hair."" More recently, researchers Barnaby J, Dixson and Paul L. Vasey rejected the notion that ""facial hair decreases a male's perceived social status because it is associated with traits such as vagrancy."" In fact, participants in their study ""rated bearded men as having higher social status than clean-shaven men."" Are there any politicians whose campaigns might have been helped if they had worn beards? ""You put John Kerry in the room with a well-groomed beard, and it makes it a lot harder for that flip-flopper charge to stick,"" says Jacobs. ""He seems like a guy who changes his positions because they evolve, and because he thinks about things."" Former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008, only to drop out after getting no traction in Iowa and New Hampshire. Soon thereafter, he grew a beard; if he had had one during the primaries, voters might not have been scared off by his hideous double chin. And despite his name, Jon Huntsman struck this year's Republican primary voters as the sort of person who might faint in terror if invited pheasant-shooting. A beard might have lent his campaign a solidity that it so desperately lacked. Beards won't take hold in politics, it seems, until a bearded candidate wins a high-profile election. Politicians are unabashed copycats and generally won't try a new campaign strategy until it's been proven to work. Howard Dean's successful use of online organizing in the 2004 presidential primaries paved the way for every digital campaign tactic in use today. Bill Clinton's smooth jazz stylings in 1992 led directly to the ""Saxophone Congress"" of 1994. Though the prospective 2016 presidential candidates are, thus far, a beardless lot, there's still plenty of time to establish an exploratory committee for someone like Beard Team USA captain Phil Olsen, who is perhaps the best hope for the future of American political beards. ""We love America, and we're growing beards for America,"" Olsen says of himself and his teammates. Someone's got to."

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/04/the_2012_presidential_election_is_obama_or_romney_the_one_who_is_out_of_touch_.html	"One way to think about the 2012 presidential campaign is as a battle between two houses: Barack Obama's White House and Mitt Romney's San Diego house. The Romney campaign would like to make Obama a prisoner to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., turning every perk and privilege of the presidency into a sign that he is far removed from the people he is supposed to lead, especially anyone struggling in this economy. ""Years of flying around on Air Force One, surrounded by an adoring staff of true believers telling you what a great job you are doing, well, that might be enough to make you a little out of touch,"" said Mitt Romney after his Wisconsin primary victory. The Obama campaign has a similar idea. They would like you to think of Mitt Romney as a man so encased in wealth that he can afford esoteric luxuries like the new car elevator planned for his San Diego home. (At Obama headquarters, they've named the elevators Romney 1 and 2 for each of his wife's Cadillacs.) ""Gov. Romney calls the president out of touch,"" Joe Biden said last week in his dual role as attack dog and envoy to The Everyman.  ""Hey, how many of y'all have a Swiss bank account? How many of you have somewhere between $20 and $100 million in your [retirement account]?"" At the start of the general election, where each candidate is trying to define their opponent in the race for middle-class support, both have settled on the same message: My opponent is ""out of touch."" The candidates will talk about jobs, tax rates, and the deficit, but those dry policy issues aren't going to stir the passions. Campaign strategists want to gall--or at least frighten--people into thinking that the other party's candidate is so bubble-wrapped in privilege that he is incapable of understanding the problems of real people. Obama should win this face-off easily, right? The polling suggests he's crushing Romney when voters are asked who is more empathetic. A recent Washington Post/ABC News poll finds that 49 percent of those questioned think President Obama ""better understands the economic problems people in this country are having."" Only 37 percent believe that Romney does. In a recent CNN poll, Obama is 28 points ahead with women when they are asked a version of that question. Plus, if you listen to cable news and the late-night comics, Romney can barely survive a fortnight without reinforcing the view that he is an out-of-touch rich guy: He says he doesn't care about the poor, he likes to fire people, his wife owns two Cadillacs, his more than $300,000 in speaking fees was ""not very much,"" and he pals around with NASCAR and NFL owners. If the election is a choice between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, then Romney is in tough shape. But Romney's team doesn't intend for the election to be a choice between two candidates. When they talk about the president being out of touch they are placing a bet on  the race being a referendum on Obama's economic record.  Right now 51 percent disapprove of the job Obama is doing running the economy. Only 41 percent approve. In today's Gallup tracking poll, on the broader question of his job performance, 48 percent give the president a thumb's down, and 45 percent a thumb's up. That is why Mitt Romney works so hard to keep this election about the economy. ""Let's hammer day in and day out what has happened under his policies,"" he said last week in a typical remark. You'll also start to hear Romney's allies taking tougher shots. The president holds fancy parties with rappers and pals around with NBA stars at his taxpayer funded home while millions of Americans are out of work is how one Romney adviser characterized it. When Obama got a little short with a reporter who pressed him on taking a vacation last week, Karl Rove (whose boss enjoyed a good deal of ""vacation time"") used it to needle the president on Twitter. It's hard to say how much punch the ""out of touch"" charge carries because it is not the only thing voters care about. In a February Quinnipiac poll, 58 percent of those surveyed thought Obama cared about people like them, while 40 percent thought he didn't. But in that same poll, 55 percent disapproved of the way he was handling the economy. Only 40 percent approved. Despite Mitt Romney's 12 point empathy deficit in the Washington Post poll, he trailed Obama by only seven points overall. In today's Gallup poll, Romney is ahead of the president by a statistically insignificant 2 percent (45 to 43 percent). The Real Clear Politics average has Obama ahead by only 3 points. On the other hand, for a president whose approval rating is below 50 percent with 61 percent of those polled saying the country is going in the wrong direction, maybe Romney's lack of empathy is what's keeping it close. Still, Romney is working hard to close the empathy chasm. In the end, he may never be able to connect with voters as well as Obama, but if he can shrink the gap, he'll improve his electoral chances greatly. So Romney's team is embarking on an effort to reintroduce their candidate to an electorate that still has fuzzy impressions of him. Today the campaign released a video about Ann Romney full of warm family moments and audio of an attentive, emotional, and at times cooing Mitt Romney. The message is that the wealthy are regular people, too."	Is Obama or Romney the One Who Is Out of Touch?	['Romney', 'Obama']	[]

It started with a conference call hosted by Mitt Romney's campaign in which his advisers were unable to give an immediate answer to the candidate's position on the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. The Obama campaign issued a statement from Ms. Ledbetter saying she was ""shocked and disappointed."" (A couple of hours after the Romney campaign was struck mute, it issued a release saying President Romney wouldn't seek to repeal the law.) Then, just before bedtime, Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen took umbrage at the fact that Ann Romney was being used by her husband as an ambassador to middle class women, saying that Ann Romney had ""never worked a day in her life."" This caused @AnnDRomney to take umbrage on Twitter. ""I made a choice to stay home and raise five boys. Believe me, it was hard work,"" she said, in her first post ever. Then, Obama's top aides Jim Messina and David Axelrod took to Twitter to take umbrage at Rosen's remarks. All of that seemed like an umbrage too far but it was just a prelude to another round of public fainting and chest-clutching Thursday. Umbrage taking is not new in politics. Aaron Burr shot Alexander Hamilton and Preston Brooks caned Charles Sumner on the floor of the Senate. When a critic gave Harry Truman's daughter a bad review, he threatened to punch him in the nose. Last campaign, umbrage became a standard part of the news cycle. Now the bar for umbrage-taking has dropped and the outrage is constant. (This conclusion will no doubt offend some of you. I am both offended and apologize for that.) We now have ongoing umbrage fests we call ""wars"": the ""war on women,"" the ""war on religion,"" the ""war on moms."" There is an old rule in politics that dates back to Roman times: Democracies in the middle of multiple real wars cannot continue to manufacture fake wars about things that aren't wars and hope to survive. What makes these fake fights burn like a summer rash is they look like real debates about real issues, but they aren't, which is ultimately deflating. It's like getting one of those ""You Have Won"" sweepstakes mailings three times a day. So for the busy voter, I propose a system that allows us to quickly categorize these flashpoint moments in campaigns: the secret conversations overheard, the admissions accidentally given or the controversies stirred up for some other reason. These categories may help you determine what's worth paying attention to and what you can blow off. Frivolous and unimportant: This category is for the political junkie only. It's anything that gets a lot of coverage, but doesn't change the campaign or have a chance to. The best historical example of this is when John McCain's campaign took umbrage when Barack Obama used the term ""lipstick on a pig."" McCain surrogates on a hastily-arranged conference call claimed it was a sexist dig at Sarah Palin. The most recent example is when Romney's top staffer Eric Fehrnstrom referred to an Etch-a-Sketch when talking about the general election. Romney's opponents said the staffer was telegraphing that Romney would try to shift every position he'd taken in the primary in his race against Obama. That wasn't what he was saying. He was talking about an entirely familiar campaign phenomenon: that voters take a new look at candidates in the general election. Did Fehrnstrom's comment mint a perfect metaphor for Mitt Romney's existing problems with constancy? Yes, but those issues were already well known. That's fun for Romney's rivals and part of the theater of politics, but it's not going to change the campaign fundamentally. Frivolous and noteworthy: This category is for those that are not going to change the outcome of the race and aren't about any actual underlying issues that affect the way people live their lives, but that participants in the race take seriously. I've assigned the Hilary Rosen business to this category. The Etch-a-Sketch controversy was entirely a confection of the press on a slow news day. In this instance though, the Obama campaign reacted before the press could even flip the switch on the phony-story Wurlitzer. Two top advisers responded immediately to the perceived slight against stay-at-home mothers. Then Michelle Obama sent a Tweet. DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz did too. By the end of the day the president had weighed in. ""There's no tougher job than being a mom,"" he said. ""Anybody who would argue otherwise, I think, probably needs to rethink their statement."" He also said spouses should be off limits in campaign spats. That much activity by people at that level in such a short period of time about the comments of a person who doesn't even work for the campaign means something is going on. This is a sign of how nervous the Obama team is about women voters. The president is 19 points ahead of Romney with women voters and he's acting like he can't afford to let that slip to 18.5. Also, since one of Mitt Romney's central claims is that President Obama is trying to manufacture fake controversies about women for political advantage (about which he is correct) it's worth noting when Romney goes to such lengths to benefit by doing the exact same thing. (The full breadth of the gimmickry was on display on a wacky campaign conference call.) This flap also marks two milestones in the campaign: the arrival of Ann Romney as a player on offense and not simply a supportive spouse. And it solidifies the role Twitter will play in the daily cut-and-thrust of politics. We can lament this development and we can make fun of it, but we should also take note of it. Serious but unimportant: The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act is a serious piece of legislation whether you're for or against it. The issue of pay equity and discrimination and how a government remedies those problems is also serious. Mitt Romney says he's not going to touch the Ledbetter Act, so the Obama team's effort to score points--through dozens of emails and a YouTube video--can largely be ignored. That the Romney campaign was caught off guard may be amusing to some but it's a distraction. If people want to press Romney on public policy that affects women, there's plenty to argue over in the Paul Ryan budget that Romney supports. Serious and noteworthy: Moments in this category may not change the outcome of the election but they touch on enduring serious issues. A recent example was president Obama's assurance to former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev that he would have ""more flexibility"" after the election. On the one hand, he was telling a truth--that domestic politics constrains him as it does all presidents in an election year. On the other hand, people should be worried about exactly what he's going to be more flexible about and why he's being more candid with a rival than the people that elect him. For a candidate who spoke so much about transparency and whose campaign relentlessly hits Mitt Romney for hiding his true core, this was also a politically important moment."

10	10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/04/trayvon_martin_case_how_it_s_changing_florida_politics.html	"Related in Slate: George Zimmerman has been formally charged with second-degree murder. It took 14 sheriff's deputies to storm the Orlando barbershop in August 2010. The barbers, hard at work, were handcuffed. Brian Berry, the owner of Strictly Skillz, looked on as his shop was raided, then swept by the police for drugs. They didn't find any. They left. The barbers sued for damages. The lawsuit dragged on, and was still unresolved as of last month, when Central Florida was consumed by the story of Trayvon Martin. On March 26, supporters of the Martin family held a community hearing in Eatonville, one of the first all-black towns founded after the Civil War. Jesse Jackson was there, as was Al Sharpton, as was Jerry Demings, the sheriff of Orlando's Orange County. It was that sheriff's department that the Strictly Skillz barbers had sued, with the help of lawyer Benjamin Crump. Crump's law firm, still working on the barbershop case, was now cycling its attorneys from TV studio to cable-news truck to talk about the Martin case. What did the barbers think of all this? Did it strike them as odd that the Orange County sheriff was there supporting the Martin family? That their own lawyers were more focused on the media melee than the pending barbershop case? No, actually, not odd at all. Visit Strictly Skillz today and you see a T-shirt pinned on the wall, with one of the famous smiling photos of the dead teenager and the words I AM TRAYVON MARTIN. ""It's a tragedy,"" says Berry. ""I think everybody in Orlando's watching this, and the nation's watching this. Everybody wants justice."" All other grievances are temporarily on hold. Nothing else in Florida politics matters as much right now as the state's attorney investigation of the Martin killing or the debate over the Stand Your Ground law. And notably it's Democrats, who have been on the losing end of ""law and order"" politics since 1966 or so, who are having an easier time talking about this subject. Florida is one of seven states where state's attorneys are elected to handle cases in several different counties. Sanford resides in Seminole County, which together with neighboring Brevard County make up the 18th state's attorney district. It's a partisan office, and Democrats haven't even bothered to run for it since the 1980s. But they're running for it this year. The current state's attorney is retiring--he removed himself from the Martin case, handing it over to a special prosecutor. Ryan Vescio, a Democrat, is an assistant state's attorney for two neighboring counties. He got into the 18th race three months before Martin was killed. He's talked about the case whenever it's come up. ""Natalie Jackson, one of the attorneys on this case--Natalie and I have worked on community issues for a few years now,"" said Vescio. ""I asked Natalie: How's everything going? How's the family doing? When did the state's attorney reach out to talk to them? And she said they never even reached out to her to talk to them. That's absolutely standard protocol! This is the job. We aren't selling lemonade on the side of the road."" Vescio's Republican opponent will be probably Phil Archer, an assistant state's attorney in the Seminole/Brevard office. He didn't personally handle the Martin case. (We're talking about a big office, with a budget close to $20 million.) I asked him why the office backed off the Martin case. ""A lot of community leaders preferred that an outside agency be involved,"" said Archer. ""Because of the rhetoric, because of the outcry and the attention, it was better to have an agency outside the circle investigate this."" This was pretty much all he wanted to say about the ""extraordinary"" case. ""All candidates--well, everyone, but especially candidates--should refrain from discussing the case until the investigation is closed. We've been hearing some accusations made by community members, and candidates, that may not be true. I think that poisons the well."" From the start, the Martin killing has been an emotional issue for black Americans, who have rallied around the Martin family. We don't have good polling yet in Florida, where the issues are especially raw. But we do have polls from the rest of the country. According to Pew, only 24 percent of white people said they were following the story closely (compared to 58 percent of black respondents), and 43 percent said the coverage went overboard. Democrats were twice as likely to follow the story as Republicans. Gallup's poll had better details. Among black Americans, 51 percent said they believe George Zimmerman is guilty of a crime; among non-blacks, the number was 11 percent. Seventy-two percent of blacks said racial bias was a ""major factor"" in the case. Among whites? Thirty-one percent. The poll was taken after President Obama said ""if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,"" and before NBC News fired a producer for editing George Zimmerman's 911 call in a manner that made him sound like he was out to kill black people. Florida politicians are well aware of the polls. ""I don't know if there is a division,"" said Vescio, ""unless it's just that that people don't like the spokesmen who've stood up for one side or the other."" He wasn't referring to anyone by name, but the situation in Sanford is following a well-established pattern, one familiar from other cases that made race a political issue. Civil rights leaders arrive; those leaders are attacked as ""race hustlers""; local politicians try to turn the story in their favor, in this case by convening ""Stand Your Ground"" forums and mounting attacks on the city of Sanford itself. The last stop I made in Sanford was at the Willow Tree Cafe, an old German restaurant with a patio suitable for parties. On this particular day the patio had been taken over by the Don Miller Show, a Central Florida black talk-radio forum that was spending two hours on ""healing Sanford."" (The show had printed up T-shirts for the occasion.) Rep. Corrine Brown, the Democrat who represents the city, rolled by the cafe with a small entourage, bursting with pride about the neighborhood. ""Everybody likes the Riverwalk?"" she said. ""Well, if you want to know where those funds came from ..."" Brown sat for a short, boosterish segment about the city, then stopped to talk to adoring constituents. What could she do about the Martin case, a constituent asked. Well, maybe there'd be another look at Stand Your Ground, but ""it's not going to pass in this time period."" What else could politicians spend their time on?

11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/04/rick_santorum_leaves_the_race_mitt_romney_had_already_won_.html	"Over to you, Gov. Romney. Rick Santorum has left the Republican presidential race, ending the most successful run by an improbable GOP candidate since publisher Steve Forbes' run in 1996. At the start of the presidential campaign, few in political circles would have predicted that a senator who had lost his last race by 17 points, who had no money, no pollster, and few endorsements, would win 11 contests.* The GOP presidential race was all but over, and now it finally is. Mitt Romney can stop fighting a two-front war, against Republican rivals to his right and President Obama to his left. His aides no longer need to start the morning with a discussion of how to tie off the Santorum challenge and where to spend precious resources. Though Santorum was not going to win the nomination, he could have wounded the eventual nominee, and Romneyland had to worry constantly about being surprised (as they were in Colorado on Feb. 7 when Santorum won a state Romney was supposed to win). Now Mitt Romney can focus all of his attention on the president, whom he trails by about 10 points. There have been a lot of presidential candidates who fell from great expectations: Rick Perry, Fred Thompson, Rudy Giuliani, and Phil Gramm, to name a few. They turned themselves into political punch lines with disastrous campaigns. The much smaller class is those who came from nowhere and energized their party, not enough to win the nomination, but enough to cause a stir: Lamar Alexander, Howard Dean, and Mike Huckabee. Now Rick Santorum joins that group. Santorum said the recent health scare of his long-ailing 3-year-old daughter Bella helped him make his decision to end the race. Though polls showed him slightly ahead in advance of the Pennsylvania primary on April 24, it wasn't a certainty that he would win his home state. By ending his campaign now, he burnishes his reputation. He leaves as a champion of grass-roots conservatives. ""It wasn't my voice that I was out communicating,"" he said Tuesday in Gettysburg, Pa. where he suspended his campaign, ""It was your voice."" Having made the right exit, Santorum can now trade on his personal brand. His first move, say those who have worked for previous Republican candidates, is to ask for a role uniting the party. That means public envoy efforts on Romney's behalf which will help the nominee but also burnish his public credentials. He can ask for input in the GOP party platform so that his pet issues get the attention he'd like and he will probably get a shot at speaking to the Republican Convention in Tampa, Fla. A nominee switching to the general election won't want a lot of talk about social issues, but Santorum could easily reprise his stump speech about Obama's elitist and out-of-touch attitude which is a central Romney campaign message. Santorum almost missed his chance to leave the race on a high note. Until his daughter's recent bout, he had been planning to fight till the last primary at the end of June. Unlike Gingrich, who though in the race is running from repose, Santorum was still hitting hard on Romney's penchant for flip-flopping and his weakness as a conservative. Romney responded to the news with praise and confirmation of Santorum's new stature: ""Senator Santorum is an able and worthy competitor, and I congratulate him on the campaign he ran. He has proven himself to be an important voice in our party and in the nation."" Just before the surprise news, Romney's aides were characterizing Santorum as a mildly crazed zealot on the verge of ruining his reputation and permanently damaging his chance to run again. The message wasn't subtle. (There may still be a warm horse head in the trunk of a Romney campaign car.) Last week the Romney campaign cut and planned to air a very tough ad attacking Santorum. They were reportedly going to spend millions of dollars making sure everyone saw it. The Romney ad, ""Historic,"" hit Santorum for losing his 2006 re-election campaign. ""We fired him as senator. Why promote him to president?"" asks the narrator. Santorum faced the prospect not only of losing standing in the national Republican Party but also of losing face at home. Santorum's departure was unexpected but it doesn't change the race much. Mitt Romney had the nomination pretty much in hand. He had hundreds more delegates and a steady stream of party poobahs who had been on the sidelines and had bestirred themselves to rally behind Romney. He was also incapable of building his coalition outside of those very conservative voters who supported him in caucuses and southern states. On Sunday, even Newt Gingrich essentially admitted the race was over. By suspending and not ending his campaign Santorum is allowed to keep raising money and he's allowed to keep his delegates. According to a source at the Republican National Committee, he would lose his delegates if he withdrew completely. Under suspension the fate of the delegates is determined by the individual states, but some are bound to support Santorum for a certain number of ballots until they are released by the campaign. Santorum didn't mention his rival in his remarks ending his campaign, but that's not extraordinary. It was his day. Earlier he had talked to Romney and the two are expected to meet soon. One topic will no doubt be Santorum's campaign debt. Moments after he withdrew from the race, Santorum sent a note to supporters explaining his decision and asking them to donate. ""Our campaign has debt, and I cannot be free to focus on helping defeat [Obama] with this burden. I am asking you to consider one more contribution of $25, $50 or even $73.10."" Perhaps Mitt Romney, now freed of a potential nuisance for the next two months, can get the ball rolling and write a check himself. Clarification April 12, 2012: Some media outlets are reporting that Rick Santorum lost his last race by 18 points and others are reporting that he lost by 17 points. The exact number is 17.3. We've rounded that down to 17. (Return to the original sentence.)"	Rick Santorum Leaves the Race Mitt Romney Had Already Won	['Romney', 'Obama']	[]
12	12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/04/george_zimmerman_killing_trayvon_martin_has_sanford_s_black_community_angry_.html	"Read Slate's complete coverage of the Trayvon Martin case. SANFORD, Fla.--Johnny Holiday lifts the bike that he bought for $15, and he makes room for me on the bench. His day off was ending at Veterans Park, the sweet spot of Sanford's Riverwalk. From our vantage point we could see clear across the lake, or we could turn and look at the area where civil rights leaders have been rallying for Trayvon Martin. ""It was wild, bro,"" says Holiday. ""You put yourself, a guy like me, in that mix, and you hear things. I got called 'cracker,' you know. 'Skinhead.' I got looked at funny."" You can't imagine anyone seriously messing with him. Holiday is tall, leathered, and built like a linebacker, biceps bulging in his T-shirt, veins bulging in his forearms. He was a Marine, served in Somalia, still wears his dog tags. And when he got to Sanford--a  pit stop, hopefully, before he makes enough money to head back to Panama--he stayed in a homeless shelter. Almost nobody else was white. But everybody got along. ""It's different since [Zimmerman] shot that kid,"" he says. ""My friends that are black have a different outlook about me. I mean, why is that, bro? Was that guy even white? He was Hispanic, wasn't he? Hell, I think they should probably try him for manslaughter."" Holiday lowers his voice, even though there's not really anyone in earshot. ""S---'s gonna go down if they don't arrest that guy."" What does he mean? ""Rodney King s---."" To prove the point, Holiday tells me to meet him in Greensboro, Sanford's oldest black neighborhood. To get there from the Riverwalk you go from First Street south to 13th Street. The $20 million of downtown renovations fade, and you head into a thicket of one-level homes. When you turn to get to Greensboro you pass the new Public Safety Complex, which houses both the police and fire department. It's impressive enough that the architects who built it feature the complex in their portfolio--""concrete tilt wall construction with hurricane impact glazing throughout, designed to withstand 150 mph hurricane force winds."" This was where George Zimmerman was taken the night he killed Trayvon Martin. The sign welcoming you to Greensboro is only a block away. Locally, the going theory is that the city moved the police department here to build up trust with black Sanfordians. It was a good idea. Greensboro was founded as an independent community for black farmers, who came here in the late 19th century to work celery fields. Sanford took it over, but Greensboro stayed segregated and separate. There are roads perpendicular to the city's main drag, but they dead-end before they ever connect. Holiday had been right about the tension. One of the first people I meet scans me up and down and looks at my notebook. ""Write something down for me,"" he says. ""Get the f--- out of here."" He's an exception. The people stopping and shopping in the late afternoon are reluctant to talk, until they get a few sentences in. And then it sounds like they're picking up on a monologue they started weeks ago, stopping to take breaths. Jamelia Jarrells and Jakivia Franklin talk about the killing as customers stroll in and out of the convenience store where they work. There's no air conditioning, and the door's constantly open, so most of the lights stay off while the fans stay on. ""I thought Zimmerman should have been arrested that night,"" says Jarrells. ""Regardless of the fact of whether or not he thought he was defending someone, he killed someone. Even if they arrested him, and he got out that same night, I think people would have felt better."" The story makes less sense as they try to put it together. ""Even if they arrest you for some little infraction,' says Franklin, ""you'll be there all night. This is a murder! Somebody got killed. This is a murder. Everybody jumps up and down. Who is he, if he only spends an hour there? What title does he have? Who's in his family?"" There are two unmistakable differences between the Trayvon conversations you have in other parts of Seminole County, and the conversations you have in the black community. The first is a level of detail. Everyone's heard of this case, but Greensboro people can go into the timing and meaning of each news break. The 911 calls. The spinning of the 911 calls. The counterattack in the Orlando Sentinel about Martin's suspension from school after he was caught with an empty marijuana baggie. Gregory Mills, jobless with a long rap sheet, talks about NBC apparently blowing it on an edit of the 911 call, making Zimmerman look fiendishly racist. The other difference: Here, every day that Zimmerman isn't arrested spawns fresh new theories and doubts. You hear rumors. Local hospitals have told employees not to take their vacations this week. Police are ordering riot gear. Mills suggests that there are ""too many organizations"" in the town, and that Zimmerman had connections that saved him. Some rumors are tied to crimes that actually were investigated, but you hear other stories of mysterious killings that the police never touched. There's an ad in the latest Sanford Herald with the name of a cold case murder victim and a suggestion to call for a new investigation. ""There's MORE to this story than what was told."" Greensboro has optimists, but they're realistic about what other people think. Even if Zimmerman's arrested, says Franklin, ""it took too long."" Not for her, necessarily. Maybe for C.J. Williams, a club promoter, who paces back and forth cursing and ranting about the police's conduct. ""If I killed you in self-defense, that means you were f---ing with me,"" he says. ""I'm not going to hide for three days. I'm going to come out and tell you why. A motherf---er who sits home and cries for three days, and won't come out and talk--he's guilty."" He points at me, then Holiday. ""If I shot somebody who looked like you, or you, shit, I'd be on death row."" ""If he was a white 17-year-old,"" says Jarrells, ""he wouldn't have been shot."" Rashid Abdul Rahman, a retiree, chimes in. ""Since we're in central Florida,"" he says, ""and there's so many movements coming through here, it's going to be OK. If we was in California, they'd be burning this up."" Burning what up? ""The city!"" They worry about it, and they don't want to see the anger boil over. But Rahman isn't bothered about the Stand Your Ground law, which city authorities cited early on as the reason they let Zimmerman go. He is just bothered by how the law is being used. ""It's the interpretation of the law,"" he says, dragging on a cigarette. ""Right now it depends on who it's being applied to. They need to amend that law so there's justice for everybody."" Williams eventually finds his calm. ""I'd like to see Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson do this, do their hoopla, when a white kid got shot,"" he says. ""If Al Sharpton did that, his image would improve, you know? If people thought he'd do this for any person who's been wronged."" His point is that this killing and this story are sui generis. There's scrutiny, the Sanford police are no longer in charge of the investigation, and people outside the city are paying attention to something that would otherwise pass right through the news cycle--black kid dead, looked suspicious. The next day, a car pulls up to a home on 14th Street and a gunman fires 30 shots into a crowd. It's a few blocks away from where Williams talked to me about Trayvon Martin."

13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/04/george_zimmerman_killing_trayvon_martin_has_ruined_what_little_reputation_sanford_fla_had_.html	"Read Slate's complete coverage of the Trayvon Martin case. SANFORD, Fla.--McRobert's Auto Center, a 54-year-old shop on the outskirts of downtown, has one of those movie-theater-style marquees with bold letters, perfect for slogans. On one side, the sign advertises tire-balancing service. On the other side--the side you see driving in from the suburbs--it reads SANFORD IS STILL A GOOD LITTLE TOWN. It means what you think it means. Mark Carli, who's worked here for four years, is sick of media frenzies, sick of marches, sick of race-baiting. ""I'm sympathetic that there was a life taken,"" he says. ""Central Florida's just gotten over the--what was it, the Susan B. Anthony thing?"" He's trying to remember the murder case that gripped Orlando last year. ""Sorry, no, Casey Anthony. My understanding of the problem there was that they jumped to conclusions and it hurt the prosecution."" The similarities between that mess and this mess: front pages full of grim details, endless after-work conversations about something everybody's sick to think about, TV trucks and camera crews occupying the grass outside city hall. The difference: For Sanford, this case is much, much worse. You've got Al Sharpton flying in, leading marches, warning that Sanford could be ""the Birmingham and Selma of the 21st century,"" and you're listening to reports about how ""racial tensions run through Sanford's roots."" Carli, who's white, knows that Sanford's got a vibrant, ""great"" group of black people. So knock off the ""Selma"" stuff already. ""I don't see it as a racial thing,"" says Carli. ""They've spun it to be a racial thing. It's just unfortunate ... the NAACP has had an office in this town since the 1960s. They've been active in this town, and never in a good way."" He's not blaming the NAACP for what happened. No one blames them. Spokespeople for the city have taken up a sort of mantra, the first sentence in every media conversation: This is about the actions of two individuals in a city of 53,000 people. The victim, Trayvon Martin, was in town visiting his father's fiancee at the Retreat at Twin Lakes. Taking this, making it about the sins of Sanford--it's not fair. Only now are people starting to clear their throats and say it. Linda Kuhn, the city's previous mayor, had brushed off calls from reporters. She saved her ire for an op-ed in the Sanford Herald, attacking the current mayor for ""go[ing] against the advice of the state attorney"" and releasing the 911 tapes of the Martin killing. ""[Mayor] Jeff Triplett's decisions have been dictated by a few outsiders,"" Kuhn wrote. ""I have yet to hear him be outraged or even defend 'his city' when Ben Jealous, head of the national NAACP, went on Meet the Press this past Sunday and stated that the KKK was alive and well in Sanford. ... Sanford was on the precipice of changing its long-standing negative image."" Negative, sure, but never as bad as this. There was the time in the late 1970s when the city responded to an order to desegregate a swimming pool by filling the pool in--it would remain segregated, or nobody would use it. In 2006, 16-year-old Travares McGill was shot three times by a security guard. The final bullet went through McGill's back and into his heart. The guard lied about it, and wasn't charged right away. In 2010, a police officer's son named Justin Collison punched a homeless man and didn't even get cuffed. But at least there the city got a new police chief, and at least Collison was eventually charged. George Zimmerman, who shot Martin, hasn't been charged with anything. That's where the ""new Selma"" line comes in. Turning into the national symbol of racial discord is costly. Head over to Twin Lakes, which is a good 10 minutes from the center of town, and you see police cars on constant watch. Last Monday, the city moved its biweekly public meeting from the usual location to the Sanford Civic Center, with the overflow crowd following the proceedings on a JumboTron. The total cost: $30,611. This was where Sharpton made the ""Selma"" comment. Sharpton's words irritated the city. So did the rumor that he'd lead a boycott of the city. He was playing around with some very real, fresh tension and mistrust. If you can take a walk without hearing some anti-Zimmerman, anti-cop sentiment, you haven't walked very far. On Monday afternoon, a black electrician who would only give his initials, J.C., waited for a bar called the Alley to open up. He was watching out for two homeless black men who'd been matter-of-factly urged to leave by a bodega owner holding up a garden hose. J.C. withheld his name because he wanted to ""be real about this"" and say what would happen if Zimmerman wasn't arrested. ""Anywhere he goes he's dead,"" he says. ""I'm sorry. That's how it is. He knows what he did is wrong. That's why he's hiding."" This was just a fact, not anything he was proud of. ""We're standing up. We're not takin' this no more. If I go to some apartment, I look like I look, am I getting shot?"" It's only a short walk from there to Maya Books and Music, a local institution that's been featured in a happy-shiny ad about Central Florida commerce and in some less-happy local news stories about whether the town's reputation is ruined. The proprietress, Yvette Comeau, wears shorts and a Beatles T-shirt as she moves around the stock. This is a slow day. The days when protesters take over downtown are especially slow. She's a little fed up with the attention. The crime scene was ""near the mall,"" far from where most people live. (The site of the killing, in a gated community, has been plumbed for significance that could absolve people who live and work in more organic places. Twin Lakes is a block of identical homes. Downtown Sanford has parks and electric-car plug-ins.) ""Al Sharpton tossed a lit match on a pile of kindling,"" she harrumphs. ""This is between the people it involves and their close relations. This is a matter for justice, not vigilantism, even if the guy Zimmerman did act in a vigilante way."" Maya Books is just a short walk from city hall and the office of City Manager Norton Bonaparte. He's running a little late for an interview, so the public information officer, Lisa Mosca, lets me into the meeting room. It overlooks the marina, with a gorgeous view of Lake Monroe. ""Look at that,"" she says, sweeping her arm in front of the window. ""That's why people come to Sanford. You can forget that with all the hoopla. This is a city of 53,000 people, and the focus right now is on two individuals."" Bonaparte arrives for his fourth reporter chat of the day. (His sixth will come when he goes on MSNBC at 10 p.m.) He's a Haitian-American who wears monogrammed shirts and a poker face that only moves when he decides that something is darkly funny. He's fond of taut answers, better if they can be shrunk into one sentence. He's the most powerful black official in the city, and his grandchildren go to school across from the gated community where Martin was killed. He's the public face of Sanford, as far as cable news is concerned. You can see why. ""The night of Feb. 26 was a very unfortunate, tragic interaction between Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman,"" he says. ""That's two individuals in a city of 53,000. In a city of 53,000, two individuals who interacted in a tragic way. That's not Sanford. I took my two grandchildren up to Fort Mellon Park yesterday."" This was where the rallies had been held on other days. ""That's the real Sanford."" Bonaparte has only lived in Sanford, in this role, for six and a half months. He's a professional urban manager who's held this job in New Jersey and Kansas, too. Hearing his city trashed by the national tastemakers? Nothing new. ""In Topeka, there's the Westboro Baptist Church,"" he says, referring to the cultish sect that picket funerals with GOD HATES FAGS signs. ""Topeka, sometimes, was painted as the home of the Westboro Baptist Church. How in the world could we stand having that church there? Well, in a city of 127,000, what 10 people did, did not define the city."" That was a crazed First Amendment story, hard to resolve unless the church lost its land lease. There is a way to end the ""new Selma"" story. ""We want justice,"" says Bonaparte. ""We want it thoroughly investigated outside of the Sanford Police Department."" Justice only means that the state's attorney, DOJ, FBI, and everyone else carries out full investigations and make their calls. It'll help when the city conducts a quick, sensitive search and finds a new police chief to replace Bill Lee, whose stepping down two weeks ago calmed things. ""We're also talking to the Justice Department about the best practices to follow,"" says Bonaparte. This is the takeaway: The city is doing what it can. The rallies have been peaceful. The police issues have been curbed. On Monday the police sent out an alert that reporters would be arrested if they followed public officials home; the bulletin was rescinded. This is not Selma. ""The fact that there was a shooting of a 17-year-old is tragic,"" Bonaparte says. ""It happens in other places. I don't know for sure--you seem rather knowledgeable--but was there a shooting yesterday in Chicago? In New York? In L.A.? I suspect that there may have been. How come that's not getting national attention?"" The reason is that George Zimmerman hasn't been arrested. Until that happens, the city can't shake the reputation. The most it can hope for is that the frenzy ebbs a little, that the news trucks park somewhere else. On Monday night, there's hope in the local press. An experimental plane crashes into a Publix supermarket in DeLand, another city in the Orlando media orbit. Tuesday's paper has a package of stories about Zimmerman, but it's not leading the paper. The headline, with photo, is: PLANE HITS SUPERMARKET It takes up all the space above the fold."	Is Sanford, Florida the New Selma, Alabama?	['Sanford']	['god']
14	14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/04/romney_santorum_and_t_s_eliot_why_did_an_etch_a_sketch_and_a_pink_bowling_ball_do_so_much_damage_.html	"Rick Santorum messed up during his visit to a bowling alley in Lacrosse, Wis. last week. He was chumming with the nearby university's College Republicans when a young man reaching for a bright pink bowling ball caught his eye. ""You're not gonna use the pink ball,"" Santorum warned him. ""We're not gonna let you do that--not on camera."" And then he went for cute: ""Friends don't let friends use pink balls."" A Reuters reporter, Sam Youngman, overheard the wisecrack and tweeted it to the masses. The Human Rights Campaign instantly issued a statement condemning Santorum's ""ignorant"" remark for ""advancing tired gender norms."" The blogosphere lit up with indignant commentary. How costly the blunder will prove--whether it will earn a footnote in history books about the 2012 campaign--remains to be seen, but ""Pink Ballgate"" has already rolled into the lexicon, darkening presidential prospects that already weren't exactly rosy. Santorum's bowling ball represents the latest in a series of objects that have attached themselves to candidates in strange and damaging ways. It's not hard to imagine a train of Etch A Sketches chacha-ing through Mitt Romney's nightmares. Back in 2000, Al Gore was laid low by a lockbox. Michael Dukakis was done in by a tank in 1988. In his 1919 essay ""Hamlet and His Problems,"" T.S. Eliot advanced the theory of the objective correlative, a concrete thing or set of circumstances that crystallized the essence of something abstract. Eliot wrote, ""The only way of expressing emotion in the form of art is by finding ... a set of objects, a situation, a chain of events which shall be the formula of that particular emotion; such that when the external facts, which must terminate in sensory experience, are given, the emotion is immediately evoked."" This modernist claim, that the scientist/artist could brew specific feelings from fixed ingredients, has experienced a bizarre rebirth on the Republican campaign trail. Only now there are no artists, only fluky events that conspire to tangle up the mythologies behind particular candidates with certain physical facts. In our age of constant media exposure, political figures have grown nebulous, enveloped in clouds of perception. Somehow Santorum's bowling ball and Romney's Etch  A Sketch have tapped into and solidified the abstractions, the popular anxieties, swirling around these two candidates--they've lodged in our imaginations as the politicians' objective correlatives. Anyone who's been 7 years old can see where the Romney/Etch-a-Sketch analogy gets its sticking power. The Massachusetts governor has offended fringe and center alike by slip-sliding all over the conservative-moderate spectrum. When senior adviser Eric Fehrnstrom announced on CNN that Romney planned ""to hit a reset button for the fall campaign ... to shake it up and start all over again ... like an Etch A Sketch,"" voters were beamed an indelible mental image of the candidate's stated convictions dispersing into tiny random dots and realigning into a picture of who knows what. (Give Eliot an Etch A Sketch, and he'll show Romney fear in a handful of dust.) Plus, there's the toy's polish, the telegenic shine of its blank screen, the smooth lack of transparency with which its designs emerge. Perhaps most damning, the Etch A Sketch unlocks certain fears that, for Romney, a void exists where his beliefs should be. That the true fuel of his campaign is sheer--and perhaps infantile--ambition. As for Santorum, what icon could be more telling than a pink globe saturated in shame and prescription? The former senator's stance on family planning puts him on the front lines of the so-called Republican ""war against women,"" where he's known for his severe attitude toward the female body. That ruddy sphere also captures the faint whiff of sexual embarrassment dogging Santorum despite, or perhaps because of, his Catholic purity. (Dan Savage's online proselytizations haven't helped.) At the same time, it speaks to his homophobic record. Presumably, at the alley, Santorum objected not to the girliness of the ball, but to its gender-bending placement in the hands of a young man. His strong reaction to a trivial detail (Does anyone actually look at the color of the bowling ball they pick up?) hints at how deep his bias may run. Also, micromanagement on this order can transmit a sort of ""lady doth protest too much"" desperation--and American politics are nothing if not an education in the notion that hypocrisy likes to hide behind implacable strictness. ""Sanctorum's"" rigidity may actually end up tarring his choirboy image. (Or so says the flamboyant sports gear now attached to his name.) Finally, that pink bowling ball exposes a gap that may be integral to understanding also-rans: the chasm between how they want to be perceived and how they are perceived. Last week, Santorum tried repeatedly to leverage his sports prowess into instant camaraderie with Midwestern voters. ""You're going to have someone who knows how to bowl,"" he told a Wisconsin crowd on Saturday, ""someone who grew up like you."" But polls indicate that the manly, grassroots message isn't getting across. Instead, the candidate's boasts are reading as vain bids to revive a faltering campaign. In other words, a bravado meant to signal blue-collar credentials is in fact coming off as weak, emasculated, and--pardon me for trafficking in Santorum's own ""tired gender norms"" for a moment--pink. So where does all this leave the voting public? Objective correlatives, like any kind of shorthand, can be useful in politics. They pin down a jumble of complex thoughts in one place; they're wickedly efficient. (Think of the pride, grief, and outrage bound up in 2003's catchphrase ""Mission Accomplished."") In the ferment of living, few people have time to lengthily analyze their emotional impressions of a candidate, formulate them into a theory, and present it around the dinner table. It's easier to call Romney the ""Etch A Sketch guy."" And it gets the job done. Or it almost does. Cognitive shorthand becomes dangerous when it threatens to replace real critical thought instead of aiding it. For me, the problems of our symbolizing impulse came home to roost in last week's Supreme Court oral argument with Justice Antonin Scalia's reduction of the Affordable Care Act to ... broccoli. Could the government force you to buy it? With his question, Scalia succeeded in (again) concretizing people's fears about a nanny state while erasing the context that would give Obamacare a fighting chance. And while my political persuasions are probably already clear, I'd be hard-pressed to argue that either the Etch A Sketch or the pink bowling ball comes close to doing Romney or Santorum justice as people or candidates. Of course, we don't know how meaningful such symbols will be in the broader story of the Romney and Santorum campaigns. T.S. Eliot might conclude by observing that, when it comes to politics, we're all unwitting poets--which, if poets are truly the unacknowledged legislators of the world, may not be such a bad thing."	What T.S. Eliot Teaches Us About the GOP Primary	['Romney']	[]
15	15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/04/what_the_media_says_about_romney_s_likely_choices_for_vice_president_.html	"Mitt Romney became the de facto Republican nominee at the end of March, after he dispatched Rick Santorum in Illinois' primary. Romney's rivals were just too weak to catch him. But the political press corps had to write about something. And so, a month ago, the Veepstakes began. Republicans close to the candidate talk about whom he might pick. Republicans nowhere near close to him speculate about it and get on TV anyway. Pollsters go into the field and ask voters whom they want, as if these voters had any idea who the junior senator from Ohio was. It's an agonizingly dull process, so we'll try to make it bearable. Below, you can see word clouds of all the terms, tropes, and cliches used to describe the 11 people most often named as possible vice presidential picks. The words were pulled from articles about the 'stakes that ran from March 28--when the endorsements started to roll in--to this week. Anna Weaver did the trawling, and Chris Kirk did the clouding. Kelly Ayotte: The junior senator from New Hampshire won her first election, ever, in 2010--an unexpectedly brutal primary followed by an easy general election win during the GOP wave. But she's female, and she endorsed Romney early, so she makes the media long-list. Chris Christie: So, where's fat? The veep-watchers have found euphemisms to describe the fact that New Jersey's governor overpowers his enemies and that he said he couldn't handle a presidential race of his own. Reluctant explodes across the screen even though Christie's said he'd be open to serving Romney. Mitch Daniels: Indiana Gov. Daniels always ranks high, if only because he was the last, most credible ""savior"" of the GOP when it was trying to avoid picking Romney. Nikki Haley: Christianity and Sikh make frequent appearances as reporters explain that the rookie South Carolina's governor naturally follows that first, more popular faith. Bob McDonnell: Nearly every story about Gov. McDonnell mentions the problem that Virginia Republicans put in his lap: the mandatory ultrasound bill. Although he eventually signed a compromised version, the controversy seems to have stuck. Tim Pawlenty: He's been mentioned as a place-holding veep for so long that reporters keep circling around the only interesting thing the former Minnesota governor once said, back in 2006: That the GOP should be the party of Sam's Club, not the country club. Rob Portman: The Ohio senator served in George W. Bush's administration, which mostly cuts against him. That fact appears high in Portman stories. Condoleezza Rice: She has ruled out ever taking the job, repeatedly, but when Republicans are polled, they drop her name. No other female candidate for the job has any foreign policy cred, so that's what the media leads with. Paul Ryan: The press has figured out that hugging Ryan's budget gave Romney credibility with the right. And it has to quote the Democrats who say they'll hang Ryan's Medicare plan on Romney, whether or not he makes the ticket. Marco Rubio: Nearly every story about the young senator from Florida asks whether he could close the GOP's gap with Hispanic voters. Stories about Rubio's childhood membership in the LDS church and his (probably innocent) fib about his family fleeing Castro rarely get mentioned. John Thune: The South Dakota senator has been tipped for greatness ever since he beat Tom Daschle in 2004. And yet veepstakes stories don't go into great depth on his accomplishments. They point out that he, uh, couldn't hurt.

Arizona argues that it has the right to impose identification checks and other measures within its sovereign borders, while the federal government argues that immigration policy ought not to be patchwork. But immigration policy is not merely patchwork across U.S. states--with so-called immigration havens in New York and draconian laws in Arizona and Alabama--it is patchwork with respect to countries as well. Many countries sending immigrants to the United States--and asking that America welcome those immigrants--themselves have policies that discourage Americans from moving there. This is a profound unfairness at the heart of our immigration policy, and one that almost no one acknowledges. The first step to domestic immigration reform may be overturning the restrictions that other nations, including Mexico, place on American immigration to their countries.

Mexico, while pressing for its citizens to work and conduct business in the United States, poses Kafka-esque obstacles to foreigners wanting to acquire legal residence and buy desirable property there. For instance, Article 27 of the Mexican constitution states: ""Foreign citizens cannot own land within 100 km of the borders or 50 km of the sea; however, foreigners can have a beneficial interest in such land through a trust (fideicomiso), where the legal ownership of the land is held by a Mexican financial institution."" Of course Mexican immigrants to the United States can own land outright.

Hurdles to citizenship are higher in Europe than in the United States. For instance, Austria, Italy, Lithuania, Slovenia, and Spain require most applicants to have a decade of legal residency (PDF) before being able to naturalize, versus the five years or less required of those seeking to naturalize in the United States. Contrast the $2,500 fees for naturalization charged by Switzerland with the $680 application fee charged here .
Many other countries, including China, Egypt, and Haiti, make it tougher for children of U.S. citizens born there to become citizens than vice versa. Bilateral agreements for citizenship would be fair, mutually enhance the respective economies, and reduce the xenophobia and antagonisms between nation-states so linked.

Of course, most U.S. citizens would not want to emigrate to Mexico, a country where the average wage is about one-sixth of what it is here. But some Americans might and some do. Even with the current legal impediments to resettling, one estimate puts the number of Americans seeking to settle in Mexico at 1 million. Think retirees who depend only on their monthly Social Security checks. Or entrepreneurs who want lower taxes. Or poor families in Minnesota who might prefer the climate and lifestyle of Baja, or Alabamans seeking relief from tornadoes.

While a citizenship policy change may not mean an immediate queue of U.S.-Americans at the Mexican border, over the long term such a policy would chip away at parochialism and leave U.S. citizens, known for high rates of domestic migration, weighing a move to Miami against one to Cancun. This may seem unlikely, but who, during the early years of the Clinton administration would have predicted that more Americans would immigrate to Ireland in the next 15 years than Irish would immigrate to America? This tide to Dublin was driven by U.S. citizens of Irish descent favored by Irish citizenship laws. A policy shift that made it easy for Americans to become Mexican might prompt a similar flow.  

Most consequential would be the long-term effects from the mobility of Mexican natives, whose ability to move legally between the two countries would change Mexico's demographics and investment patterns. More of its own citizens would remain or return, as occurred in the European Union when, for instance, Portugal and Greece joined: Greeks and Portuguese who had been residing in wealthier countries such as France came home to reap the benefits of the foreign investments the EU incentivized.  

The United States should sign bilateral treaties agreeing to naturalize citizens from other countries on the same terms as the partner countries naturalize Americans. The point is not that most Americans would pursue a tarjeta verde, but that just knowing this is possible would make Mexico and its citizens less alien. Ultimately, a bilateral citizenship treaty with Mexico would further blend the two countries. It's been almost two decades since salsa passed ketchup as the top condiment in the U.S.  Meanwhile, Coca Cola and Pepsi drinks dominate the Mexican beverage market. Eventually, Spanglish may become the primary spoken language in some parts of North America, a phenomenon that for many of course evokes fears of cultural extinction. We should not give into these collective fears but look at a map of North America from 1700 and recognize that today's nations and nationalities are historical flukes: Spain, France, England, the Chickasaw and hundreds of other settled nations then prevalent in today's borders no longer populate our landscape. Why raise a ruckus about keeping people out of a place that was not ours to begin with when instead we could be snorkeling in Cozumel?"

There it is, next to the adorable confectionery and wedding dog photos. Well, I like quaint, and if you also like a Dr. Seuss saying stenciled on an ambiguous decorative item, then join me on my search for candor in the 2012 presidential campaign. I need your help. We need honesty now more than ever. There are big decisions to be made. A $1 trillion deficit requires a retooling of much of the federal government and a reworking of the tax code. At the very least, Americans are going to have to accept big changes in what they've come to expect from their government. Or they may have to face brutal reductions in public services they count on like the military or quality medical care for the elderly. Mitt Romney attacks President President Obama for not being candid, saying his hot mic moment with the Russian president ""calls his candor into serious question."" The Obama team makes the same charge about nearly every word that comes out of Romney's mouth. In the books each candidate has written, they've both said that a lack of honesty is what's ruining politics. Successful politicians must shade the truth, embellish it, and keep everyone happy by avoiding it. But if this year's contenders are going to go on so much about candor, it's worth asking how honest has either candidate actually been. At a later date we'll try to figure out who tells hard truths more often. First, though, we'll need a baseline: What is the most candid thing each candidate has said? I asked each campaign to furnish an example. By candid, I don't mean specific. I mean, what's the best example of a candidate saying something honest enough to cause voters a moment of discomfort. Mitt Romney:
""Our next president is going to face difficult choices. Among these will be the future of Social Security and Medicare. In their current form, these programs will go bankrupt.  I know that, you know that, and even our friends in the other party know that. The difference is that I will be honest about strengthening and preserving them, and they won't."" Being candid about how you're going to be candid is no kind of candor at all. Taking credit for honesty you're not actually offering while criticizing the other party for not being honest compounds the offense, creating a net reduction in candor. Romney could say that under the plan he favors, Medicare recipients who expect a defined benefit will have to switch to a plan in which the contribution is defined. That would get a conversation going. Romney has been specific about the tax rate reductions people will get, but when it comes to being specific about how those reductions will be paid for, he's less so. The Wall Street Journal reports his economic advisers are having trouble getting the numbers to add up in a way that isn't politically unpopular. Of course, Romney had his own hot-mic moment a couple weeks back when he appeared to be speaking candidly with wealthy campaign donors. Some journalists overheard Romney offering a Dixie cup of detail about closing loopholes for mortgage interest deduction for second homes and trimming some federal departments. But apparently if we thought we heard some candid ideas from the Republican challenger, we were mistaken. Romney's campaign quickly rushed forward to say he was just repeating ideas he had heard on the campaign trail. President Obama:
""So this notion that somehow we're offering smoke and mirrors--try to tell that to the Democrats out there, because part of what we've done is we've been willing to cut programs that we care deeply about, that are really important, but we recognize that given the fiscal situation that we're in, everybody has got to make some sacrifices; everybody has got to take a haircut."" The Obama campaign offered several other examples that were very much like the one the Romney camp offered: quotes about how hard choices had to be made without being specific about what those choices would be. This quote, while offering no actual candor, does point to cuts in specific programs like home heating aid, community block grants, and education programs that are in the neighborhood of the type of hard truths we were looking for. They are bad news for voters that the president would like to keep happy. The president has an advantage over Mitt Romney in this way. Because his actions have consequences--candidates, by contrast, can pretty much say any old thing--his aides can point to support for legislation like Dodd-Frank where the president's advocacy damaged him with the banking industry. Several Democratic fundraisers have said this has led to the slow pace of fundraising on Wall Street. The president could be very specific if he wanted to be. During the budget negotiations that collapsed surrounding the grand bargain, he considered some cuts to entitlement programs that he never talked about publicly. We're not likely to find out what those trade-offs are now that we're in an election season. There is a known bug in this experiment. Campaign aides are not the best ones to ask about their candidate's candor. The modern campaign is a series of emergency exercises where aides are trained to smother any compromising thought that makes a break for it. Romney has (rather candidly) talked about his specific strategy against specificity--the more detailed you are the more you'll be attacked. I can, however, think of a moment when Mitt Romney told farmers and businessmen at a meeting in Treynor, Iowa, he wasn't going to support their ethanol program. ""I'm not running for office based on making promises of handing out money,"" he said. ""Let Detroit Go Bankrupt,"" was a pretty gutsy thing to say, too. (Although the campaign says that wasn't the governor's actual wording for the headline of the op-ed he wrote arguing against the auto bailout, it does approximate the sentiment of the piece.) Romney is paying more of a price for those words in the Midwest than Obama did in 2008 for his comments about fuel efficiency standards. The lack of honesty in campaigning is nothing new. In 1920, H.L. Mencken observed that ""the first and last aim of the politician is to get votes, and the safest of all ways to get votes is ...to be happily free from any heretical treason to the body of accepted platitudes--to be filled to the brim with the flabby, banal, childish notions that challenge no prejudice and lay no burden of examination upon the mind.""* Still, we must hope. Sure, candidates shouldn't be asked to commit political suicide, but they must be brave enough to say something more bracing than a cloth diaper. So I will continue to look for examples of candor during the campaign season and try to break off pieces of it from the permafrost of the two campaigns. If you have a better example, please email me at slatepolitics@gmail.com, and I'll elevate it to the top of the running list. This isn't necessarily an exercise in comparative candor. I'm just looking for the truest thing said by each candidate. Perhaps by the end of the campaign we might find an example of something Obama or Romney  has said that's provocative enough that we'd really want to tack it up on the wall, and say, ""Hey, thanks for being honest.""

Another title for his book, a history of our current House of Representatives, might be Worst Congress Ever. Draper wrote back. ""That's about 50 times pithier than Do Not Ask What Good We Do."" To research the book, Draper embedded with new and senior House members--mostly Republicans--shortly after the 2010 election. His reporting took him from the shooting of Gabrielle Giffords through the spring 2011 passage of the government-funding continuing resolution through the soul-deadening summer of the debt-limit vote. It took about as much time as an average pregnancy for 87 new legislators to become convinced that Congress didn't actually work for them. The intended punch line: For the new guys, this is how Congress always looks. The rest of Draper's title quote, uttered by a retiring House member in 1796, is asking what good the body can do ""is not a fair question, in these days of faction."" Well, phew--if the legislative branch was born dysfunctional, and we've made it this far, America might survive the Tea Party Congress. I said might. Here's a quick guide to the more embarrassing or telling moments from Draper's insta-history. The Democrats: Anthony Weiner Division
The first juicy Draper leaks appeared in Politico and the New York Post last week. News Corp.--the bane of Anthony Weiner's existence--got to display his corpse and take a few more stabs at it. How much more can you reveal about a man whose erect (clothed) genitals are only a Google click away? You can reveal how much his former colleagues despised him. Weiner comes off as a buffoon with zero strategic skill and 100 percent confidence in said skill. On MSNBC one day, when his party still controlled Congress, he claimed that a health care bill minus a public option would lose 100 votes. ""That number had just popped into his head,"" reports Draper. ""He'd uttered it without any reason to believe it was accurate. And yet it soon became a widely quoted number."" In 2011, as his profile rose, he gave his leaders advice such as ""get a hundred and fifty of us and agree not to raise the debt ceiling--that's the Republican majority's job."" They did not listen. Before the State of the Union, he told friendly reporters that he'd  ""sit next to two Republicans tonight--one I like, and one I can say 'fuck you' to. Just for ballast.'"" The Democrats: Non-Weiner Division
Draper finds the House Democrats in a jumpy, irritated, despondent mood. They were warned by pollster Stanley Greenberg, at their first Obama-era retreat, that many of them would fall in 2010. They panicked anyway. Former members like John Tanner (Tennessee) and Glenn Nye (Virginia) wail to Draper about how Nancy Pelosi ruined them by forcing tough votes, watching them lose, then running for leader again. ""Instead of running a race where it's me against the other guy,"" gripes Nye to Pelosi, ""I'll be dealing with the same ads."" Nye, defeated, gives up and joins the private sector. The remaining Democrats find unity only when Paul Ryan introduces his budget and they know what they're against. Rep. John Dingell is amused to learn the sexual definition of the term teabagging. ""That's disgusting,"" he tells his tutor, ""but it's funny, and I'm going to keep using it."" Democrats find another kind of unity in the debt fight, as the president betrays them. ""The president is the worst negotiator who has ever owned that title!"" says California Rep. Dennis Cardoza to Pelosi. ""I didn't know Millard Fillmore, but... he's the worst. He doesn't know how to do this."" Pelosi's response: ""Yeah, but he doesn't think so."" Draper's Republicans sing the same notes. Rep. Raul Labrador, a freshman from Idaho, speaks up in a meeting with Obama, assuring him that the GOP can work with him.* ""The new House liaison for the White House,"" writes Draper, ""stepped forward and handed Labrador his card."" This is the universal sign of ""whatever."" Obama never calls Labrador. But the people who actually reach out don't do any better. When a clutch of House Republicans walked into the Senate to personally lobby Democrats for ""ayes"" on the old Cut, Cap, Balance bill, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia says, ""If you could find three other votes, I'd go along."" They don't find them; he doesn't go along. Allen West: Asterisk With a Bayonet
Other people seem to figure out Allen West's celebrity before he does. Draper goes back to the Article 32 hearing that West faced after interrogating an Iraqi prisoner with a loaded gun and firing it an inch away from his head.* His attorney, Neal Puckett, is ""awed"" by West's performance in the hearing. ""The nation's going to see you as a leader who stands up for what's right,"" says Puckett. ""Allen, you should run for Congress."" West demurs and says he just wants to avoid jail. But Puckett proves to be right. West, a Florida Republican, wins his seat and informs his new staff of his old standing orders. Keep your bayonet sharp. Keep your individual weapon clean. Be the expert in your lane, and knowledgeable in another. Be professional. West is blunt. When Barney Frank mocks the Republicans for a marathon series of amendment votes, West calls him ""a guy who for all practical purposes should be in a pink jumpsuit for what he did."" The Congressional Black Caucus issues a condemnation of the Ryan budget. West disagrees. CBC Chairman Emanuel Cleaver soothes him by promising that ""we'll make sure that on positions that we send out, we'll have some kind of asterisk that suggests that this is not reflective of all the members of the caucus."" The Debt Ceiling: Everybody Loses
Republican leaders figured out early that some members of the freshman class simply didn't get macroeconomics. Majority Leader Eric Cantor warned Democrats about it when the debt fight began. The ""cardinals"" on the appropriations committee have zero regard for Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy. ""He didn't seem to know the difference between 'obligations' (funds allocated) and 'outlays' (funds spent),"" writes Draper. ""[A]s a result, he was in no position to educate the freshmen."" McCarthy compounds the problem with field trips where freshmen members watch debt auctions and are ""rendered speechless, as if bearing witness to a state-sponsored execution."" When White House veteran Jay Powell gives Republicans a Power Point, explaining the need to raise the limit, Rep. Phil Gingrey of Georgia blows him off. ""You did a nice job with your presentation. But we heard from Karl Rove yesterday--and frankly, I like him better."" The Show-Horses: Universally Despised
There's a bipartisan overlap between the Republicans who make liberals angry and the Republicans that their colleagues don't respect. Rep. Joe Walsh ""had told some of his Republican colleagues, with a straight face, that he had a 'cult following.'"" So a staffer shows Rep. Renee Ellmers--a star that the leaders actually like --a tape of Walsh getting flayed by Chris Matthews. ""See,"" says the staffer, ""this is exactly why (a) we don't do Hardball, (b), we vet all the requests we get, and (c) we're prepared."" South Carolina's four freshman Republicans, all of them deeply conservative, form a bloc that votes against any spending bill. When he's whipping the continuing resolution, Rep. Peter Roskam asks if they ""intend to blindly follow Jim DeMint."" When they refuse to back the strict debt deal that narrowly passed the House--the doomed one, right before the actual deal--McCarthy blows up at them. ""Screw it! No deal! We're done!"" And yet when the four freshmen need to save funding for the Port of Charleston, they swallow pride and get a favor from a Democrat, Rep. James Clyburn. ""The money was procured,"" reports Draper. ""It was not an earmark. Rather, the telephone request was direct and paperless, a so-called phone mark."" Do not leave an email trail of what good they do.

Point the time machine back to April 10, the day that Rick Santorum suspended his presidential campaign. Grenell opened up the iPhone and sent 17 tweets.  He accused MSNBC of bias. WashPost poll shows Romney leading Obama on Who best to handle the Economy AND the Deficit. BUT @chucktodd leads with #'s on Women. #Blatant He tweeted at a liberal blogger and a presidential candidate, goading them about President Obama's campaign speech. @markos @MittRomney: When @BarackObama is in FL today, ask him about the 850k Floridians out of work & 9.4% state unemployment rate  He retweeted a Romney fan with a strong opinion. Love following @RichardGrenell. The man tells it like it is. That was the old Richard Grenell--longtime communications director for a string of United Nations representatives and ambassadors. On Thursday, Mitt Romney's campaign hired Grenell as a full-time spokesman on national security matters. His tweets took on world-historical importance. Politico's Alexander Burns combed Grenell's feed and found jokes about the Gingriches (""Newt: My 1st Lady knows what it's like to be 2nd and 3rd..."") and Rachel Maddow (""Rachel Maddow commercials can't possibly attract any viewers, aside from Bieber fans #DeadRinger""). ThinkProgress ran its own report only five hours after sort of saluting Romney for hiring an openly gay spokesman. By Sunday, when the Huffington Post's Michael Calderone followed up, Grenell's micro-blogging history had shrunk from 7,577 tweets to 6,759 tweets. This was a massacre--800-odd tweets slaughtered for the cause of Not Embarrassing Romney. Grenell's personal site had been taken down, even though (according to WhoIs.net) he owns the domain name until 2020. The remaining on-message campaign talk was the only online evidence of Richard Grenell's existence. Grenell, post-purge, is weathering the attacks. He's donned the hair shirt and apologized for ""any hurt"" caused by his 140-character barbs and crack-'em-ups. The campaign, he says, has given him no directives about what to say. The personal website wasn't very controversial, anyway. ""Everything on there was published somewhere else and is available online,"" he says. But he hasn't said much else. Since announcing the job and accepting some compliments, Grenell has only tweeted one opinion about politics--campaign guff about how the ""election is about the president's record and 38 months of unemployment over 8%."" The ongoing conversation with reporters and bloggers has ended. The reporters and bloggers aren't missing him. Markos Moulitsas, the founder of DailyKos.com, says that Grenell used to ""troll"" him ""several times a week over the past 6-12 months."" ""I maybe responded 2-3 times,"" said Moulitsas. ""He seemed [to be a] garden-variety conservative troll, except that he was a former Bush administration official."" He might be a future Romney administration official, too. He could, depending on the makeup of the Senate, have to answer for his Twitter and Huffington Post column oeuvre. That's really the point. Grenell's job is safe, but we're surely only weeks away from seeing some staffer at the Obama or Romney campaign apologize or self-terminate because he got too hot for Twitter. Let's all promise to go easy on him. Grenell's deleted tweets reveal that he thinks Newt Gingrich's campaign is/was risible and that he has insults ready when celebrities show up sloppy to the Grammys. At worst, they were unfunny experiments in ankle-biting. The tweets that survive, gathered by Uri Friedman, reveal that he has, basically, the views of his most famous former boss, John Bolton. ""Why haven't politicos learned by now that you scrub your Twitter feed of all controversial content before you enter the political limelight?"" asks Friedman. Why should they? Better question: Why should anyone want them to? The best argument comes from Jonathan Rauch, a journalist who knows Grenell a little. Grenell's problem reveals ""what an embarrassing waste of time Twitter is. It's not a medium for adults--it practically begs you to be short, snarky, and stupid--and foreign-policy spokesman is a grown-up job."" Sound advice: The spokesman who speaks best speaks least (and probably never on Twitter). The legendary practitioners of spokesmanism, like Mike Murphy or Ron Ziegler, put words in an order that make them basically useless for the purpose of information-gathering. When Grenell was raw, he was tweeting the sort of things Republicans actually think. April 17: ""Does Obama do anything without a teleprompter?"" April 6: ""Samantha Power is all talk."" And March 27: ""What I love about Twitter and Facebook is that it has outed reporters from their phony facade of pretend non-partisan commentary."" It's outed a lot of other people, too. Don't delete it. Embrace it."	Why Is Romney's Foreign Policy Spokesman Cleaning Up His Twitter Account?	['Love', 'Obama', 'Romney', 'Alexander']	['gay']
20	20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/04/george_w_bush_and_torture_america_s_highest_officials_are_responsible_for_the_enhanced_interrogation_of_prisoners_.html	"It began with one document. On Sept. 17, 2001, six days after the terrorist attacks in Washington, D.C., President George W. Bush sent a 12-page Memorandum of Notification to his National Security Council. That memorandum, we know now, authorized the Central Intelligence Agency to set up and run secret prisons. We still don't know exactly what it says: CIA attorneys have told a judge the document is so off-limits to the courts and the American people that even the font is classified. But we do know what it did: It literally opened a space for torture. Thanks to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit--a lawsuit the New York Times has called ""among the most successful in the history of public disclosure""--we now know much of what happened in those secret spaces the Bush administration created. Under that litigation, the American Civil Liberties Union gathered nearly 140,000 formerly classified documents from the Department of Defense, the Justice Department, and the CIA that detail the abuse of prisoners in U.S. custody in the ""War on Terror."" My job, as the author of the website www.thetorturereport.org and then of the book The Torture Report: What the Documents Say About America's Post-9/11 Torture Program, was to dig through that incredible trove of documents and figure out for myself what, exactly, my country had done. Here is what I learned. Our highest government officials, up to and including President Bush, broke international and U.S. laws banning torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. Worse, they made their subordinates in the military and civilian intelligence services break those laws for them. When the men and women they asked to break those laws protested, knowing they could be prosecuted for torture, they pretended to rewrite the law. They commissioned legal opinions they said would shield those who carried out the abuses from being hauled into court, as the torture ban requires. ""The law has been changed,"" detainees around the world were told. ""No rules apply."" Then they tortured. They tortured men at military bases and detention centers in Afghanistan and Iraq, in Guantanamo, and in U.S. Navy bases on American soil; they tortured men in secret CIA prisons set up across the globe specifically to terrorize and torture prisoners; they sent many more to countries with notoriously abusive regimes and asked them to do the torturing. At least twice, after the torturers themselves concluded there was no point to further abuse, Washington ordered that the prisoners be tortured some more. They tortured innocent people. They tortured people who may have been guilty of terrorism-related crimes, but they ruined any chance of prosecuting them because of the torture. They tortured people when the torture had nothing to do with imminent threats: They tortured based on bad information they had extracted from others through torture; they tortured to hide their mistakes and to get confessions; they tortured sometimes just to break people, pure and simple. And they conspired to cover up their crimes. They did this from the start, by creating secret facilities and secrecy regimes to keep what they were doing from the American people and the world. They did it by suppressing and then destroying evidence, including videotapes of the torture. They did it by denying detainees legal process because, as the CIA's Inspector General put it in a 2004 report, when you torture someone you create an ""Endgame"" problem: You end up with detainees who, ""if not kept in isolation, would likely divulge information about the circumstances of their detention."" They managed all this, for a time, through secrecy--a secrecy that depended on the aggressive suppression of two groups of voices. Over and over again, in Afghanistan and Iraq, in Guantanamo, in secret CIA black sites and at CIA headquarters, in the Pentagon, and in Washington, men and women recognized the torture for what it was and refused to remain silent. They objected, protested, and fought to prevent, and then to end, these illegal and immoral interrogations. While the president and his top advisers approved and encouraged the torture of prisoners, there was dissent in every agency, at every level. The documents are full of these voices. In fact, it is thanks to these dissenters that much of the documentary record exists. From emails among FBI agents sharing their shock over scenes they had witnessed in interrogation booths in Guantanamo, to letters and memoranda for the record, to major internal investigations, the documents show that those who ordered and carried out the torture did so despite constant warnings and objections that their actions were ineffective, short-sighted, and wrong. It is no wonder that so many of these documents were suppressed. Alongside the dissenters, another group of voices surfaces in these once-classified materials: the men we tortured. Theirs are the voices the entire system of incommunicado detention and closed tribunals was constructed to censor, and it worked: To this day, few Americans can identify more than a handful of detainees by name. Fewer still know how far from the ""worst of the worst"" the vast majority of those we tortured turned out to be. Torture dehumanizes. But that only extends a process of dehumanization that must take place in order for abuse to happen: It is impossible to torture those whose humanity we recognize. In joke-filled letters to their attorneys, in frank and vivid testimony in tribunal transcripts, in startlingly naive and in powerfully emotional exchanges with interrogators, images emerge not of the maniacal and monolithic and monstrous, but of distinct and recognizable individuals. To hear these voices is to begin to reverse the terrible dehumanization the documents chronicle. Last month, I was once again in a federal courtroom in New York, watching one of the last chapters in the remarkable Freedom of Information Act saga that has unearthed those 140,000 torture documents. The argument that day centered on whether the CIA would finally be required to release a single photograph of Abu Zubaydah, who was captured 10 years ago last month and who became the first subject of the Bush administration's experiments with ""Enhanced Interrogation Techniques."" The CIA has gone to extreme lengths to conceal images of Abu Zubaydah and his treatment first in a secret CIA dungeon in Thailand and later in another CIA black site in Poland--lengths that include destroying 92 videotapes of his interrogation and torture. It has paid no price for destroying those tapes, or for holding Abu Zubaydah for more than four years in its network of secret prisons, or for his well-documented White House-orchestrated torture, which included 83 episodes of waterboarding, the last one overseen by a Washington official who flew to the black site because the administration refused to believe his interrogator's conclusion that he was not withholding information. The court has not yet ruled on the question of the photograph. But there is little reason to believe the CIA will now be required to turn over a picture that very well may offer graphic evidence of abuse--and at the very least would drive home the simple fact that the target of so much calculated and extreme mistreatment was a single, and at the time utterly defenseless, human being. But we should hardly need that photograph. We already have Abu Zubaydah's own descriptions of his ordeal, in his statement to the International Committee to the Red Cross and in his testimony (still heavily redacted) to the Guantanamo tribunals. Those descriptions match exactly the treatment the CIA proposes and Bush's lawyers approved in the infamous Aug. 1, 2002 torture memos. We don't have the videotapes, but we do have the list of cables that flowed back and forth between the Thai black site and Washington reporting on the progress of Abu Zubaydah's interrogation. And we have the CIA Inspector General's appalled reaction after he flew to Thailand to view those tapes. It is one thing to be in the dark; it is another thing to have the record of what happened in the darkness right in front of us, and fail to reckon with it. That, sadly, is the situation in the United States today. In March, the Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza reported that prosecutors in Poland have charged the country's former top intelligence official with depriving Abu Zubaydah and others of their freedom and allowing corporal punishment in the secret prison the CIA set up and ran near the village of Szymany. The CIA shipped Abu Zubaydah from Thailand to Poland on Dec. 4, 2002. When he arrived in Szymany--hooded, diapered, shackled--and stepped onto the tarmac with his armed, CIA-contracted escorts, he was setting foot in a country with one of the newest constitutions in the world, a nation that in the moving words of that document's preamble, remains ""mindful of the bitter experiences of the times when fundamental freedoms and human rights were violated in our Homeland."" Ratified in 1997--barely five years before the CIA's plane landed--Poland 's constitution declares simply, ""No one may be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. The application of corporal punishment shall be prohibited."" That the United States operated secret prisons anywhere on earth just so we could place our prisoners and jailors outside the reach of U.S. laws prohibiting torture is outrageous, of course. But there's something especially perverse about basing one of these facilities in a country whose ""bitter recent experiences"" include first Nazi occupation and extermination camps and then four decades of communist oppression. Out of those experiences, the people of Poland created a state that embraces, without reservation, the absolute ban on torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment, and the first thing the United States does is degrade that state by setting up and running a secret torture chamber on Polish soil. How would Americans feel if we learned our government had secretly allowed a foreign government to violate some of our most basic laws and fundamental principles on American soil? Shouldn't we be just as outraged to know our government conspired to violate those laws and principles abroad? That it did so in secret no longer absolves us: Plenty of the record is public now; now we know. And with Poland's former spy chief under indictment for facilitating the CIA's torture, and with similar investigations under way in several other countries, we, and the world, will soon know more.

On Tuesday night, after his client and advisee Mitt Romney had spent a day making speeches about taxes, Fehrnstrom noticed a picture of President Obama playing with his dog, Bo. David Axelrod, his nemesis in the Obama campaign, had tweeted the photo to tweak Romney. ""How loving dog owners transport their dogs,"" wrote Axelrod. Get it? Axelrod was making either the 12,936th or 12,937th joke about a 29-year-old incident involving Romney's dog, a car roof, a 12-hour drive, and dribbling feces. (The first thousand jokes were told by Gail Collins.) Bad timing. Fehrnstrom had read a blog post resurrecting the bit from Dreams From My Father wherein Obama remembered youthful digestive experiments with ""dog meat (tough), snake meat (tougher), and roasted grasshopper (crunchy)."" Obama had eaten dog meat? This was too good to keep on Jim Treacher's news blog. Fehrnstrom retweeted Axelrod and added ""In hindsight, a chilling photo."" Within an hour, Jake Tapper of ABC News was out with a story titled ""Romney Campaign Notes that Obama as a Boy Ate Dog Meat."" Not long after that, the Drudge Report popped a link to Tapper. One tweet from an iPad, and the Romney campaign had knocked back five years of dog stories. You've got a bogus controversy? Yeah? Yeah? How do ya like this bogus controversy? Great things can grow out of stupid stories. Fehrnstrom jacked into an emerging, jokey conservative meme. It even had a hashtag: #ObamaDogReceipes. ""John McCain's presidential campaign wouldn't have touched this anecdote with a ten-foot pole,"" wrote the National Review's Jim Geraghty. ""Between this and the Romney camp's rapid response to the Rosen comments, we are seeing a Republican presidential campaign that is exponentially faster on its feet and way more nimble than the previous general-election campaign against Obama."" That was the point. Republican voters, the choosey people who made Romney survive three months of primaries, believe that Barack Obama won too easily in 2008. The media and the McCain campaign failed to ""vet"" him. I heard iterations of the theory when South Carolina Republicans blew their kingmaker record and chose Newt Gingrich over Romney. Gingrich, they told me, would ""eviscerate"" and ""lacerate"" Obama. McCain? Poor guy had his chance, and he wimped out. The theory is sound. It's been documented that McCain warned staff and ad-makers off of certain topics, like Barack Obama's membership (now expired) in Jeremiah Wright's church. Days before the 2008 election, the McCain campaign dispatched spokesman Michael Goldfarb to CNN, where he kept implying that Obama palled around with anti-Semites--nearly flouting the Wright rule. Then-host Rick Sanchez kept needling Goldfarb, encouraging him to say it. When Goldfarb wrapped and headed back to his office, he was greeted by whooping, cheering staffers. ""Everybody was psyched about it,"" says Goldfarb. ""Everybody in the campaign wanted to go there. But McCain was the boss."" Four years later, Goldfarb chairs the Center for American Freedom, which publishes the Washington Free Beacon. The former is a parody of the Center for American Progress; the latter is a parody of its blog. In an essay introducing the project, editor in chief Matt Continetti explained its origins in the media-went-easy theory of the 2008 election. ""Obama's life and record,"" he wrote, ""were treated with nothing that approached the scrutiny accorded to John McCain's friendship with lobbyists and to Sarah Palin's life story."" Tucker Carlson's Daily Caller, fount of Obama's ""doggate"" story (seriously, that hashtag emerged on Wednesday), was founded with the same gripe. The media, said Carlson in 2010, had indulged in ""an enormous amount of throne-sniffing"" to protect Obama. The Romney campaign knows how to use this. Actually, it might be forming the single best connection between the least-liked Republican nominee in decades and the most conservative party base that's ever existed. Romney will never be Sarah Palin, who could ""go rogue"" off the McCain message in 2008--she had a Vulcan mind-meld with Republican voters and an intuitive sense of how to make the other guys look like sexists. (Four words: Lipstick on a pig.) Romney lacks that, but his campaign staff has put together a reasonable facsimile. Ferhnstrom, in particular, knows what the base will consider fair play and how the media will react to it. Last summer he was uncloaked as the man behind ""CrazyKhazei,"" a fake Twitter account mocking a candidate who briefly ran against his client, Scott Brown. (""I promise to devote all my time in office to making gay videos. Shame on Scott Brown for focusing on jobs!"") Fehrnstrom didn't apologize. ""Sometimes we take our politics too seriously,"" he told the Boston Globe, ""and this was my way of lightening things up."" A Khazei campaign vet, not really eager to relive their failure, admitted that the brazenness of the tweet campaign took them by surprise. They were earnest. The other team wasn't. A few months later, Romney went on the air in New Hampshire with an ad full of 2008 vintage Barack Obama quotes. ""If we keep talking about the economy,"" said Obama, ""we're gonna lose."" One problem: Obama was merely quoting his opponent, John McCain. Politifact unleashed its full ""pants on fire"" rating for the perfidy. Fehrnstrom and the rest of his team put out the fire and shrugged. ""It was all very intentional,"" he told me. ""You had the press secretary to the president of the United States talking about an ad that was running on one station in New Hampshire,"" crowed another adviser, Stuart Stevens. Winning meant pissing off the other guy, no matter how you did it. Michael Goldfarb applauds the Romney campaign's punch-back abilities--but only up to a point. ""They've been attacked on the dog thing to an insane level,"" he says. ""They get an opportunity, and they hit back. But both this and the Rosen thing were totally reactive. This was a response to the Seamus story, that was a response to the 'war on women.' You don't see them going after character and bio, which were the things McCain was accused of going soft on."" Not technically, no. But look closer. The ""dog meat"" hit reminds viewers that Obama spent an odd childhood in Indonesia, something the media wants Republicans to shut up about. The Hilary Rosen flap had a second life when right-bloggers tried to prove that a CNN contributor was a key White House ally--more media-Democrat collusion! And on Tuesday, in the midst of all this, Romney gave an interview to Breitbart.com. Its readers and writers firmly believe that Obama was never vetted. Romney told them that he, too, was aware of the ""vast left-wing conspiracy."" The message: I, too, understand the conservative mind and what it wants from its candidates. The outrage will change from day to day. The dog meat is less important than the dog whistle."	How Team Romney Connects With Hard-Core Conservatives	['Sanchez', 'Obama', 'Romney', 'McCain']	['gay']
22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/04/herman_cain_remains_a_tea_party_favorite_even_as_a_failed_presidential_candidate_.html	"William Temple put on the classic militia outfit, grabbed the Gadsden flag, and headed to Herman Cain's Sunday night reception. He has 12 different get-ups to re-enact different military eras, but this one--tan sailcloth, black leather gaiters, tricorner hat--goes over the best at Tea Party events. Reporters love this. Temple is probably the most-photographed soldier of the Tea Party movement. Alas, it's Sunday night at a hotel in a particularly anonymous quadrant of the Washington, D.C. suburbs. Barely 150 people have shown up. So Temple grabs appetizers. There are four nearby tables piled high with grape leaves, various cheeses, pita bread tips, and charcuteries. ""I'm here to support Mr. Cain in whatever he does,"" says Temple. ""What the media did to force him out of the race--that was one of the worst things ever done in this country. I emailed [Fox News reporter] Carl Cameron on it, and said it was a high-tech lynching. He emailed back, and said 'I'm not an investigative reporter.' This was Fox News! Fox News carried this story with no proof."" A waiter walks by, cradling a tray of crabcakes, each approximately the size of a gummy eraser. ""Ah, yes!"" says Temple, affecting his revolutionary-era accent. (Think of an extra from the John Adams mini-series.) ""I'll have a full regiment."" The waiter moves over to Judson Phillips, the founder of Tea Party Nation and mastermind of the February 2010 National Tea Party Convention. That event cost up to $549 per ticket. This event is free. Phillips passes on the crab cake anyway, as he scans the crowd for networking opportunities. Look, there are leaders from Tea Party Patriots! Over there--that's the editor of Tea Party Review magazine! ""Herman Cain is becoming the man of the moment, as far as the Tea Party's concerned,"" says Phillips. ""What's his role in the movement now? I'd call him a strategic planner without a portfolio."" You can chortle at the empty chairs and uneaten catering at the Renaissance Hotel, but put it in perspective: The inspiration is a guy who dropped out of the presidential race before any of the primaries. He had to drop out because middle-aged women kept materializing in TV studios and describing grabby encounters with the former National Restaurant Association boss. As he was quitting, he spent more than $300,000 on legal bills. And yet here he is, still beloved by the movement that briefly made him a legit threat to Mitt Romney. Here's Mark Block, Cain's chief of staff, still Internet-famous for the campaign video that featured him free-associating about Cain's ""campaign like no other"" and smoking a cigarette in front of a brick wall. ""How many candidates dropped out of the race?"" he asks, rhetorically. ""Herman didn't go away. Here's a joke among staff that we love. He took 'three days of vacation' after the announcement, okay? Two and a half days of that, he was working, setting up Cain Solutions."" Quitting the presidential race worked out brilliantly for Cain. Contrast his life with that of Newt Gingrich, still technically running for president. Cain now heads three organizations, with loosely defined goals--Cain Connections, Cain Solutions, and the Herman Cain Foundation. At this reception, he will announce a video channel called CTV. Its flagship show, confusingly enough will be called Cain TV. A short preview shows the host, a beefy joke writer named Rodney Lee Conover, mocking the life and loves of Sandra Fluke as a cartoon of the birth-control advocate sprawls lazily and lustily on a dorm room bed. It compares awfully well to the no-end-in-sight tragedy that is Newt 2012. When he left Congress, Gingrich started founding think tanks and holding conferences that people actually showed up to--the strategy that Cain is Xeroxing. Those think tanks, now Newt-less, are shutting down. Running for president doesn't give Gingrich space in the media to share his grand ideas. It gets him headlines about being bit by penguins. The life of the professional has-been is sweeter than the life of the has-been candidate. On Sunday, Cain and his flock finish the appetizers and move into a conference room decked with American flags. The theme is a tribute to Andrew Breitbart, and the conservative media pioneer's successors are ready with a tribute video and speeches to the ""fallen soldier."" (That's Cain's phrase.) The ex-candidate keeps referring to ""300 people"" in the room, even though half that many are actually occupying chairs. ""Don't worry about the numbers that turn out,"" he says. ""It was a small, passionate group that fired King George."" For inspiration, he shares the thought that came to him when watching airplanes land at the nearby Reagan National Airport. ""In order for us to win, we've got to be like an airplane with wings. If you're going it alone, it's like going down the runway with no wings. An airplane that does not have wings cannot fly. We must get past the differences we have and puts wings on this movement!"" The event breaks up after Cain sings a song about ""believing in yourself, because God believes in you."" It picks up again Monday morning with another crowd of 120 to 150 people in a half-empty room. The accidental intimacy gives Tea Partiers close access to the Cain-approved conservative leaders. You can't miss the focus on nonwhite outreach, the factor that Cain lovers worry that they lost when their candidate lost. A spokesman for America's PAC talks about the ads they'll run--""REAL hope and change!""--on ""black and Spanish radio."" K. Carl Smith, the black founder of Frederick Douglass Republicans, talks about the ""90 percent success rate"" he has converting someone to the cause. ""This is a fantastic networking opportunity,"" says Craig Bergman, the head of the Tea Party of America. (Its big moment came last year, when it drew Sarah Palin and her obsessive press detail to a rally in Indianaola, Iowa.) ""You've got the leaders of all the second tier conservative groups in one place."" This is a compliment. The second tier groups actually do things. Cain's two-day rally is sponsored by Ralph Reed's Faith & Freedom Coalition and a pack of local, mostly Southern groups--Gibson County Patriots (Tennessee), Georgia Young Republicans, Columbia Tea Party (South Carolina), Conservatives for Action East Tennessee. ""Too many of the so-called Tea Party groups,"" says Judd Saul of Iowa's Cedar Falls Tea Party, ""are jerking off Mitt Romney."" Saul and Bergman are not entirely convinced that the Cain movement has its activism figured out. It's just outside the GOP establishment, and outside the Romney campaign. That's enough for now. They join the rest of the activists, jump on the bus, and head to Cain's Capitol Hill rally. Chris Burgdon, Cain's cowboy-hatted videographer, boards another one of the six chariots and tells its occupants to get revved up. ""Gimme a 9-9-9!"" 9-9-9! ""Now say, we're not stupid!"" We're not stupid! The bus chugs along I-395 into Washington, past the museums on Constitution and Independence Avenues. There are three congressional candidates on my bus, two of them black Republicans. Corrogan Vaughn, who ran for Senate in Maryland, says that Cain's organizations want him to run again next time. ""Compare him to this president, who says that Trayvon Martin looks like the son he never had,"" says Vaughn. ""He incites the black community in a way that makes this an issue of us against them. He's a charlatan and a socialist. That's the nicest thing I can say about him."" Our badges display our names underneath a photo of Cain pointing at the Capitol and looking back at the camera, grinning broadly. ""Here's what was accomplished,"" says Cain, referring to the day's rally. ""This nucleus of people are gonna be part of the army we're building to take the message back to their groups. A lot of them were leaders from various groups. What we accomplished was, we brought a lot of Tea Party citizen leaders together, even if their members weren't here."" When tallying up the size of the crowd, Cain tells me to be sure to ""count everybody that was sitting in the shaded trees and everything."" Was he disappointed by all the people who didn't turn up? ""No, I'm not disappointed. For one thing, they might be trying to finish their taxes."""	How Herman Cain Became a Professional Has-Been	['Romney', 'Hill', 'Adams']	['god']

The latest: Somewhere a microphone is always hot. On Sunday, Mitt Romney was unknowingly overheard at a Florida fundraiser by reporters for the Wall Street Journal and NBC News giving his wealthy backers a sneak preview of his presidential plans. He outlined some of his theories for cutting the bloated federal government, including eliminating the Department of Housing and Urban Development and trimming the Department of Education. He also floated the idea to the upscale crowd of removing the mortgage interest deduction for second homes as well as ending the state income tax deduction and state property tax deduction, tiny but specific steps on how he would remove loopholes in the tax code to pay for his tax cuts. He and his wife, Ann Romney, also delighted in the political ""gift"" given to them last week by Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen. The candid remarks present the latest test of our easy-sort campaign coverage system that we launched last week and they fall into two categories: Frivolous and unimportant: A story that won't change the election and tells us something we already knew--though perhaps in a new way. According to Ann Romney, she had a lot of fun in her new political role. ""It was my early birthday present for someone to be critical of me as a mother,"" she said. ""That was a really defining moment, and I loved it."" In response to last week's flap over comments by Hilary Rosen, President Obama said political wives should be off limits. Ann Romney's remarks show that she is well aware that she has an important political role to play in her husband's campaign. Though she would probably prefer not to be heard gloating in public, the fact that a political spouse plays politics should surprise no one. Serious and Important: A development that voters should care about. Like most presidential candidates, Mitt Romney is vague about how he would pay for tax cuts. He suggested in an interview with the Weekly Standard that getting specific only gets you into political trouble. But apparently he is willing to be specific with some people, in this case wealthy donors--though even this secret candor does almost nothing to illuminate his budget plans.This is a basic matter of being honest with voters, just as it was with President Obama and his remarks to the lame duck Russian president* (which Romney said was part of Obama's ""hide and seek campaign"" in a recent speech.) *Correction, April 16, 2012: This article originally referred to Dmitry Medvedev as Russia's former president. He is in office until May 7."	What Mitt and Ann Say When They Think Only Wealthy Donors Are Listening	['Romney', 'Obama']	[]

The ""war on women"" began its life in a February 2011 House speech about abortion. After a short life as a Democratic hobby horse, it died during the second week of April 2012. The cause of death: Rosengate, the latest and least explicable battle in the Umbrage Wars. On Wednesday, in her capacity as a CNN political analyst, Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen laughed at Mitt Romney's claim that he stayed in touch with the economy through his wife, Ann. ""His wife has never actually worked a day in her life,"" said Rosen. Over the next 24 hours, the Romney campaign managed to make Democrats--including First Lady Michelle Obama--stop what they were doing and denounce Rosen, who does not work for the Obama-Biden campaign or the Democratic National Committee. ""The issues of stay-at-home moms and women being hurt by the economy are not good turf for [the Democrats],"" explained RNC deputy communications director Tim Miller. ""Their 'war on women,' which was milked for weeks, is definitely no longer. They have the woman problem right now."" Even a dead talking point can teach us something. The ""war on women"" was a fitfully successful frame for Democrats to describe anti-abortion bills, then anti-equal-pay legislation. Birth: The war on women line was born during the debate over the long-forgotten No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. The midwife was a man: Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York. ""This legislation,"" he said on Feb. 9, 2011, ""represents an entirely new front in the war on women and their families."" The bill--one of many that would pass John Boehner's House and run aground in the Senate--was a mess. It would have prevented the use of any tax benefits to pay for abortions, and in its original version provided an out only in cases of ""forcible rape."" Democrats, bruised and humbled by their landslide 2010 losses, started raising money with war-drum emails about the threat to choice. The newborn talking point rolled off the tongue and straight into press releases: The Center for American Progress described the bill as ""the Right's War on Women."" Planned Parenthood protested the doomed bill with pre-printed ""War on Women"" signs. Awkward childhood: Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, one of her party's rising stars, started using the war on women line in March 2011. Nobody noticed. When she became the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee in May 2011, people started noticing. She noshed at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast on May 26, after the House had voted to ban any taxpayer money from going to Planned Parenthood. ""The war on women that the Republicans have been waging since they took over the House,"" she said, ""I think is going to not only restore but possibly helps us exceed the president's margin of victory in the next election."" Republicans were miffed. ""Apparently it's open season on Republican women,"" said Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the highest-ranking woman in Republican leadership. When a talking point is criticized, it becomes controversial. In June, Politico published a story about the ""rocky start"" of the new DNC chair, noting that ""she's accused Republicans of wanting to reinstate segregation and of waging a 'war on women.' "" This had drawn the ire of ""some Democrats,"" ""one Democratic consultant,"" and no Democrats with identifiable surnames. Respectable adulthood. Talking points generally have the life expectancy of a frontier family on the Oregon Trail with no medicine. But if it doesn't die, it thrives. Wasserman Schultz kept on saying ""war on women,"" and Republicans kept on giving her reasons to. The best was the ""personhood amendment,"" a constitutional addendum, rejected by Mississippi voters in November 2011, that would have defined life as starting at conception. This, said Wasserman Schultz on MSNBC, was especially offensive ""for me as a woman who gave birth to two of my children through in vitro fertilization."" For every Republican outrage, there was a three-word talking point in pocket, ready to drive the GOP up the wall. Between January 1 and April 12, the New York Times published 24 references to the ""war on women"" and the Washington Post published 26 such references. Most of the war talk came when Democrats, Wasserman Schultz included, used Rush Limbaugh's feud with Sandra Fluke to warn about Republicans limiting birth control. The war on women was obvious, said Wasserman Schultz in an interview around the time of the Fluke contretemps, ""whether it was the Blunt-Rubio amendment, personhood, or attempts to repeal Roe vs. Wade."" The prefab talking point was an enormous help. Why? Limbaugh only noticed Fluke in the first place because she'd testified on the ""contraception mandate"" recently enacted by the Department of Health and Human Services. That issue was supposed to rally Americans of Faith against the Obama administration. Democrats eventually turned it into the Midway of the War on Women. Old age. A talking point either fades or it devours itself. The ""war on women"" started swallowing its tail on April 5, when Al Hunt asked RNC Chairman Reince Priebus if this whole ""war"" thing was legit. ""If the Democrats said we had a war on caterpillars,"" he said, ""and every mainstream media outlet talked about the fact that Republicans have a war on caterpillars, then we have problems with caterpillars."" Anyway, Priebus explained, it was all a distraction from Obama's ""war against the Vatican."" Republicans were through with this. The ""war on women"" would be mocked to death. On Twitter, the hashtag #waronwomen was co-opted, becoming a one-stop joke shop. The Washington Free Beacon, a new-ish site of anti-Democrat ""combat journalism,"" started running stories about President Obama's ""boys club."" And Mitt Romney's campaign put together a fightback. ""They will try to debunk the notion that Romney's policies have hurt women,"" reported the New York Times' Trip Gabriel and Ashley Parker, ""turn the criticism back on Obama and outline how they believe women have suffered under his administration, and brand those issues in a memorable way."" The strategy was rolled out at a campaign stop in Wilmington, Del., this week. Standing in front of a crowd of XX-chromosomed Americans, a blue-blazered Mitt Romney declared that ""the real war on women"" was ""job losses in the Obama years."" Democrats had gone after anti-contraception bills? Fine. Romney would go after unemployment. On Thursday, the Republican National Committee issued a nine-page memo on Obama's war against women, citing such evidence as ""an unnamed high-ranking female official"" who believed ""Obama 'has a real woman problem.' "" Death. As Romney and the RNC fought back, Democrats started to choke. In her fateful CNN appearance, right before she evaluated Ann Romney's economics cred, Hilary Rosen begged the media to ""just get rid of this word, 'war on women.' "" After all, ""the Obama campaign does not use it, President Obama does not use it--this is something that the Republicans are accusing people of using."" On Thursday, as the Rosen saga unfolded, DNC communications director Brad Woodhouse echoed her plea for peace. ""I'm not a fan of the term,"" he said in an interview. ""I mean, I'm sure I've probably used it. We all fall into these easy vernaculars ... but we in the DNC have not been running a campaign based on the term 'war on Women.' That's a myth cooked up by Republicans."" Ding-dong, the talking point is dead. But don't fret too much for the Democrats. They'll find another zinger."

But will it be enough to avoid a messy brokered convention in August? Following his big win Tuesday night in Illinois, Romney has secured 563 delegates, by the AP's count. That's a lot more than his nearest competitor, but to say he's won the race is premature: It takes 1,144 delegates to sew up the GOP nomination, so technically he's only halfway there.* As the emphasis shifts from poll numbers to delegate math, here's a look at how the candidates have fared so far and how far they are from the finish line. (You can also check Slate's animation of the full GOP horse race based on polling data.)

They could interrupt the play-by-play because nothing was likely to happen on the field to spark the magical comeback I was hoping for. The opposing quarterback, untroubled by madness or sorcery, would take a knee, and the clock would run out. Tonight, Mitt Romney swept the primaries in Wisconsin, Maryland, and the District of Columbia, banking his 25th win out of 37 contests. He picked up 83 delegates to Rick Santorum's nine. (This figure has been updated. An earlier version reflected incomplete results.) This broadcast of the Republican nomination was produced by ... Technically, there is still time on the clock--19 contests to go--and there are undoubtedly some Santorum fans in their knit caps and team jerseys hoping the game will turn around. But it's over. Mitt Romney's rivals aren't going to catch him. He is hundreds of delegates ahead and gaining more with every contest. In Wisconsin, according to exit polls, 8 out of 10 voters said Romney would be the eventual nominee. Even two-thirds of those who voted for Santorum agreed with that prediction. The only consistent foe Mitt Romney has faced in the GOP primaries has been apathy. Herman Cain, Rick Perry, Newt Gingrich, and Rick Santorum have--at one time or another--carried the banner of the vocal minority that is uneasy with Romney, but none of them could build a big and durable enough coalition to beat him. These newest victories were merely a capstone on a move to rally behind Romney that has been underway since his big win in Illinois. Luminaries from all factions of the party have now called on Republicans to unite and turn their attention to beating Barack Obama. In the national Gallup poll, Romney is ahead of Santorum by 15 points. The battle for the general election is escalating with Obama and Romney giving speeches that would still be pitch-perfect if they were given in October. The ad wars are heating up, too. This is the first week the president's campaign directly criticized Romney by name in an advertisement. No one with heft in the Republican side has stopped the stampede to say, ""Hold on, let this primary play out."" With no rousing alternative to Romney, apathy was not enough to defeat him. Even as he approaches the finish line, excitement doesn't seem to be building. His party is hoping that Obama's record will hand Romney a victory. It's a shaky platform on which Romney begins his general election campaign. Romney has two immediate repair jobs to do. He must unite his party, and he must heal his badly battered image with key voting blocs: independent voters, women, Hispanics, and the working class. If Santorum doesn't get out and picks up some pyrrhic victories in the South, Romney could enter the general election with as many or more defeats than any other Republican nominee since Gerald Ford lost 23 primary contests to Ronald Reagan in 1976. Recent endorsements from Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and Jim DeMint have helped close the door on the nominating process, but they have been of the kiss-and-run variety usually reserved for a game of spin the bottle. Sen. Marco Rubio told the Daily Caller, ""There are a lot of other people out there that some of us wish had run for president--but they didn't."" Conservative leader Al Cardenas recently wrote an op-ed backing Romney. He said the GOP primary was turning into an ""Are we there yet?"" car ride. This is not true of all of Romney's endorsements, however. Some of his recent supporters actually seem like they want him to be president. Still, of the two repair jobs, that one is easier. Movement conservatives may be tepid about Mitt Romney, but they really dislike Barack Obama. And the president keeps reminding them why. His promise to Dmitri Medvedev that he will  have ""more flexibility"" after the election suggests that he's willing to be more honest with our rivals than the American people. The president's campaign against Mitt Romney will revolve around the charge that Romney says whatever is convenient at the political moment. President Obama was telegraphing to the Russians that during election time he'll behave the same way. Profligate spending at the General Services Administration doesn't hurt Romney's campaign, either. That scandal will keep the Tea Party energized for months. But that might not be enough to help Romney. Mitt Romney needs to improve his lot with swing voters, and right now the polls suggest he's in the worst position of any candidate since Bill Clinton in 1992. Fifty-two percent of independent voters view Romney unfavorably, and only 35 percent view him favorably, according to a recent Washington Post poll. President Obama has a 50-46 favorable-to-unfavorable rating with independents. Among women, a key voting bloc, Obama has an 18 point lead over Romney in a recent USA Today/Gallup poll. Republican presidential candidates usually do worse with female voters, but this is suitcase-on-the-front-lawn bad. And women aren't the only bad news for Mitt. A CNN survey showed Obama leading Romney 54 percent to 43 percent nationally, up five points from February. In the Gallup swing-state poll, he is up 51 to 42 over Romney. How does Romney fix all of this? He can pray that Obama stumbles and the economy stops improving. Another way is to mount some kind of Clinton-like comeback. That would require a set of political pirouettes that Mitt Romney has never shown the legs for. He lacks Bill Clinton's raw political skill, and he also lacks Clinton's biography. In 1992, the Clinton team could re-introduce the Arkansas governor as the son of a single mom from modest roots. Romney appears scared of patches of his biography. His wife seems great, but so did Elizabeth Dole and Tipper Gore, who were also called on to bedazzle voters into overcoming their doubts about their husbands. Romney has another hurdle: He can't take advantage of the ideological flexibility that allows primary candidates to refashion themselves as general election candidates because he has already shifted on everything from abortion to his status as a Republican to his advocacy for gay rights. All candidates try to shed the pointed views they held during the primaries or at least downplay them. In 2008, Obama's top economic adviser Austan Goolsbee quietly told a Canadian official that his boss was merely posturing when he promised to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, that it was just talk to rile up the base and he didn't really mean it. The Obama team had to insist he'd never do such a thing. Of course, as Goolsbee predicted, Obama never followed through on his primary campaign rhetoric. Romney can't do this. The press and the Democrats have him so pinned down, an aide can't say ""Etch A Sketch"" without having it become the new symbol for Romney's lack of core convictions. When Ann Romney said she was going to ""unzip the real Romney,"" and introduce him to Americans, it threatened to animate this storyline again. The president called out Romney by name Tuesday in his critique of Paul Ryan's budget, a continuation of Joe Biden's effort the week before to tie the front-runner to the Republican Congress. As Ezra Klein points out, Romney has tried to stay vague on the details of his proposals, and Obama is trying to staple Romney to the highly detailed plan that he has endorsed. If, as the nominee, Romney tries to suggest he might do something different from Ryan while still supporting it--as he did last year with the congressman's aggressive plan for restructuring Medicare--the Obama campaign will pounce. What normally might be seen as a garden-variety political act of ""flexibility"" might quickly be seen as another example of Romney's lack of core convictions. While Mitt Romney was moving on to the general election, Rick Santorum's campaign announced that he would campaign in Pennsylvania ahead of the April 24 primary. ""We have now reached the point where it's halftime,"" Santorum said. ""Half the delegates in this process have been selected, and who's ready to charge out of the locker room in Pennsylvania for a strong second half?"" He's not going anywhere, was the message. That's certainly been true in a growing string of primaries where Santorum hasn't been able to break out of his box. Since his revival in the Colorado, Minnesota, and Missouri contests on Feb. 7, Santorum has not been able to win support beyond the most conservative wing of the GOP. As Ron Brownstein noted recently, Santorum's support has been confined to a narrow band of evangelical voters who identify themselves as conservatives."	Can Romney Heal His Self-Inflicted Wounds?

You probably didn't caucus in Iowa or plant yourself at the bar in American Samoa. You might not even live in Florida, which would make candidates care about you after the primary is over. Congratulations! We're basically irrelevant. Ah, but I've figured out how to make politicians pay attention to me. Since 2007, I've been a registered Republican in Washington, D.C. There are not very many of us. The last time the primary came here, in a city of 617,966, only 6,211 of us turned out to vote. How many Democrats turned out? Only 20 times as many: 123,994 of them. Us lucky Republican voters got to be statistically significant. All they got was the 44th president. I wasted my vote anyway. Slate tradition demands that we admit whom we vote for. 'Fess-up time: Jon Huntsman got at least one vote out of Washington, D.C., Precinct 46. My candidate dropped out of the race three months ago. I used to wonder about the kinds of people who punch the ""Herman Cain"" button now that he's turned his attention away from campaigning and over to surrealist art. Now I'm one of them. How did every other candidate lose me? Rick Santorum forfeited and never made the D.C. ballot. Every other candidate made it to a pro-con list, then got inked out for some vital reason. Newt Gingrich nearly won my vote. When the legit-looking e-voting machine displayed his name, I was tempted. Gingrich had identified what was wrong with the campaign long ago: People kept making fun of him. ""The thing I find most disheartening about this campaign,"" he said last week, ""is the difficulty of talking about positive ideas on a large scale because the news media can't cover it."" Ha, ha! Laugh so you don't weep. The theory of the Gingrich campaign--brain-science speeches, open Q&As at black churches--was brilliant. The theory didn't last. Under pressure, Gingrich would pivot to the looming ""war on religion,"" or how people thought Obama was a Muslim because of his foreign policy, and so on. That wasn't really new. In his prime, Gingrich combined Tofflerian idea promotion with raw politics and liberal-baiting. Also, in his prime, Gingrich was one of the politicians who decided to squander one of the most prosperous years in American history on Bill Clinton's sex scandal. I couldn't reward Gingrich's good behavior without accidentally rewarding all of his bad turns. Mitt Romney did not flirt with an ""ideas"" campaign. At least 18 minutes of my campaign-trail recordings consist of Romney reciting or singing ""America the Beautiful."" His strategy: Win just about enough Republicans to grind out a nomination in a year that the incumbent might lose. It will almost surely work, so Romney doesn't need any more help. You need to understand that I like ""ideas"" campaigns, and I didn't want to vote for the obvious winner. Why didn't I just submit to Ron Paul? Two reasons, and one of them probably makes sense. First, the stupid reason: Paul has run for president three times. You can see a Ron Paul banner in the background of a scene in Slacker, filmed in Austin in the late 1980s (one of the best movies ever made). You can still find pro-Paul outsider art on assorted D.C. lampposts, promoting his 2008 campaign. I registered Republican so I could pick Paul that year. His 2012 campaign is the last chapter of a long, fitfully successful libertarian crusade. It already got my vote. The other, more sensible reason I stiffed Paul: the newsletter story. When the worst paragraphs of the old Ron Paul Survival Report first surfaced, in 1996, Paul apologized. When they came up again in 2008, he said he didn't know who wrote them. The media re-re-rediscovered them in December 2011, and Paul denounced them while not denying that he knew the authors. Fine, then. It's a mystery. Somebody else can endorse it. The lengthy process of judgment and scowling left me with a choice. Should I waste my vote by writing somebody's name in? Should I go for the faux liberal candidate who is now auditioning for a stool on Morning Joe? It was a low-reward choice, and an easy one. If you looked past his whiff of a tax plan (Huntsman recommended using the flat rates that Simpson and Bowles recommended not using), the guy had a few good ideas. The worst knock on him during the brief period when he looked relevant was that he sat with a Slate writer for a long profile. That's a lousy reason to vote against somebody. So Huntsman it was. Bias disclosed. Really, it wasn't personal."	Why I Wasted My Vote on Jon Huntsman	['Paul', 'Romney', 'Simpson', 'Obama']	[]

That was when Politico's Dylan Byers reported that the ""last embedded print reporters"" had disembarked the Gingrich bus, ""$2.50 Gas"" signs fading in the distance as they lugged away their laptops. They would not be in Hudson, Wis. to see Callista reading her history book to tykes. They would be elsewhere when Newt brought the gospel of hydraulic fracturing to Green Bay. How was the Gingrich campaign holding up? This had to be having an impact on them, right? ""Absolutely zero impact,"" said Gingrich's spokesman R.C. Hammond. He ticked off, one by one, the ways that the fourth estate will get to interact with the former speaker. ""Print correspondents cover the campaign--they might hit our event in the morning then Santorum in the afternoon. If a network correspondent wants us, they come meet us on the trail, just as they did when the embeds were around."" Gingrich was still available for ""the most important media: local media."" He was still mic'ing up for Fox News, and by appearing on the ""talking head shows so much there is always a fresh quote on his take of current events."" Hammond was describing a return to normalcy. On June 9, 2011, Gingrich's campaign staff up and quit on him, and he became a curio candidate that networks didn't devote many resources to following. In early November 2011, Herman Cain's campaign collapsed because of ""false and unproved accusations"" that were actually, mostly, proved. The networks and newspapers spent money on him again--up to $2000 a day on planes--for full-spectrum coverage. Now that he's losing to Ron Paul, Gingrich's trackers are leaving him. And the Gingrich campaign swears this will be good for him. This is almost true. Let's start by admitting that Gingrich will not win the nomination, and that the former speaker of the House who resigned under pressure and then married his mistress was probably not going to run away with this thing. The campaign question is no longer ""Can Gingrich win?"" It's ""When does Gingrich have to drop out?"" He says he doesn't, because he can still get the sort of attention he needs. And if we define ""need"" narrowly enough, he isn't wrong. For now, at least, he still has the attention of embedded TV reporters, though not ""because there's a high likelihood he'll be president,"" said Ron Fournier, the editor-in-chief of National Journal. (The magazine has a partnership with CBS News.) ""There is a high likelihood he can do and say things that affect the race. Both he and Santorum are capable of making news."" Though the heavy-embed stage of the primary is ending, coverage of the primary might not change. Most Americans, consuming their usual news, saw the campaign as a slog with occasional breakout stories--gaffes, missteps, glitter-bombings. They still get it whether a candidate has 25 cameras on him or whether a ThinkProgress blogger is watching the sole C-Span feed. Look back at the twin March 13 primaries in Mississippi and Alabama. They were the last contests where all four candidates--Ron Paul included--had some embedded reporters following them. The result was beaucoup coverage of a 10-second moment when a goofily sincere Mitt Romney announced that he liked ""cheesy grits."" The candidates joined in. Newt Gingrich would occasionally veer from his main campaign theme--""Newt = $2.50 gallon gas"" --to mock Romney's grit ignorance. A Lexis-Nexis search of TV coverage between Super Tuesday and the Mississippi-Alabama primary gives you 65 mentions of the Gingrich gas pledge, most of them from Gingrich's TV appearances. The number of ""cheesy grits"" references? Ninety-nine. It was the line that cable news couldn't quit. It was the quote mocked on Saturday Night Live and the quote that listeners had to guess on NPR's Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me. (""I never heard it called cheesy,"" murmured Roy Blount Jr. ""It's cheese grits."") Here's another example. On March 27, Rick Santorum gave an hourlong speech in Janesville, Wis. The local ABC News story: ""Santorum Makes Campaign Stop in Janesville: Presidential Contender Touts Paul Ryan's Budget."" This generated six whole reader comments. Three days later, Gawker's Max Read noticed that the proudly teleprompter-free Santorum had chewed up a line about Obama's last campaign: ""anti-war, government nig-uh, the, uh, America was a source for division around the world."" Headline: ""Did Rick Santorum Almost Call Barack Obama the N-Word?"" That got clicked nearly 50,000 times, and shared on Facebook around 2,000 times. The news cycle is restless, random, and cruel. Nothing that Mitt Romney's embedded reporters covered last week got as much attention as a blown CNN interview of the candidate's key aide, Eric Ferhnstrom, when he chirped that the campaign could be shaken ""like an Etch a Sketch"" after the primary was done. The people tracking Romney across the country ended up filing stories about a single cable news hit. By the end of the week, 44 percent of voters said they'd heard about ""Etch a Sketch."" And why wouldn't they have liked that story? ""Americans,"" said Fournier, ""have always been the kind of people attracted to the next shiny object."" Gingrich helped. He and Rick Santorum both bought and displayed the red-framed rectangular toys. That story broke out and led both the cable news shows and The Daily Show. Nothing else they were saying got attention like this. That's what the Gingrich campaign means when it dismisses the ""embeds."" There's got to be some reason no one will cover what the candidate actually says! The local news--now, those guys will cover the story right. This gripe has precedent. Every campaign, when it feels like it's getting sucked into the buzzy, silly news cycle, bangs the gavel on the embed's camera. Ron Paul's campaign, which lost its embeds right after the Alabama/Mississippi primaries, had been complaining about this for months, all the way back to Iowa. ""They follow you around,"" griped Paul's campaign chairman/grandson-in-law, Jesse Benton, when the candidate stopped taking national media questions. ""They never make any news about your event. They are there to ask loaded questions and catch a candidate at a loose moment, to see if the candidate trips or gaffes or throws up. It's really very unhelpful."" Well, the press isn't supposed to be helpful. It's introducing voters to the people who want to rule them. Eyeball-to-eyeball coverage of the candidates is part of that. And then any given day of the campaign can turn into coverage of grits, toys, or a word that fell in the wrong place. Gingrich's whole campaign is allegedly about consciousness-raising and big ideas. Now that he's sticking around to lose primaries and talk to delegates, yes, it probably helps to have the national media downgrading him to curio coverage. If you want people to show up to your big policy speeches, run for president. If you want the press to write about them, try something else."	Newt Gingrich Lost His Media Entourage This Week.
