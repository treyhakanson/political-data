Brennan Jr., who was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Eisenhower in 1956 and resigned in 1990, was the most influential justice on the bench in the second half of the 20th century. Step back further, and his stature is even greater. Thanks to his wide-ranging contributions to the court's expanding role during those three-and-a-half decades, he was one of the most important justices in American history. Building on the court's landmark ruling about equality before the law in Brown v. Board of Education, he led the court to extend that principle in matters of race and gender. Voicing the need for a robust press to speak truth to power, for every adult to vote, and for each vote to count the same, he helped strengthen the workings of our democracy. Rewriting rules about access to welfare benefits for poor people, to collective bargaining for labor, and to the federal courts for prisoners, he helped provide crucial measures of fairness. In his 533 opinions for the court, Brennan shaped hundreds of other areas as well. In his 694 dissents, he was often even more forthright about articulating the views on equality, liberty, and human dignity that animated his jurisprudence. The overarching question for a biography--particularly an authorized biography, written with access to some papers that others aren't allowed to see until 2017--is, What made Brennan so influential? In  Justice Brennan: Liberal Champion, commissioned almost a quarter of a century ago, Stephen Wermiel joins forces with Seth Stern to argue that as ""a progressive centrist,"" Brennan succeeded in large part because he was a relative moderate rather than a flaming liberal. Above all, he was a pragmatist. To every new set of law clerks, he would hold up a hand with fingers splayed and instruct that his goal in each case was to get to five votes. Wermiel and Stern's argument that he was a shaper of consensus is unsurprising and wholly convincing. For over two decades, or two-thirds of his tenure, Brennan's skill as a coalition-builder made him dominant, first as ""a judicial partner"" to Chief Justice Earl Warren, then as a foil to Chief Justice Warren Burger. More surprising, but still generally persuasive, is their brief for Brennan as a relative moderate. But their portrait fails to address the power, scope, and grandeur of the ideas that gave coherence to Brennan's jurisprudence. After Brennan died in 1997 at the age of 91, a ""Memorial Resolution Adopted by the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United States"" offered a perspective that's missing from Justice Brennan. Drafted by professor Burt Neuborne of NYU Law School and added to by others, it positions Brennan with Chief Justice John Marshall and Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., all three of whom redefined the ""role of a constitutional judge in a vibrant democracy."" Marshall ""pioneered the use of judicial review."" Holmes ""helped to chart the complex relationship between judicial review and respect for the will of the majority."" Brennan deployed ""a modern, purposive reading of the Bill of Rights in defense of the innate dignity of the individual."" His contribution was to remind us ""that true democracy requires us to fulfill our duty to the individual."" It has been Brennan's legal enemies who have generally been readiest to credit him with a political philosophy--albeit rooted in a personal, rather than principled, vision. Central to the conservative attacks on the Warren Court a generation ago was a portrait of Brennan as an avatar of judicial activism. A measure of that campaign's lasting impact is that many liberals, too, assume that, in shaping key rulings of the Supreme Court, Brennan imposed his own views and preferences. The biography usefully complicates that reductive notion, most notably in the realm of gender relations. As a non-devout but practicing Catholic, Brennan was personally conservative and opposed to abortion. But he was unequivocal that women have the right to choose and he made fundamental contributions to Justice Harry Blackmun's opinion in the 1972 case of Roe v. Wade. In a series of cases, Brennan also decried America's ""long and unfortunate history of sex discrimination"" and was the court's leading champion of gender equality. Yet this same man, while charming and chivalrous toward women, had no female clerks during the first half of his tenure on the court. He finally hired one only when a male former clerk rebuked him, saying that he couldn't believe the justice would ""continue a policy that is both unconstitutional and simply wrong, and is so much at odds with your great principles."" Biographical sleuthing ends up shedding less light on the overarching conception of American democracy that Brennan put into practice while applying the Constitution. When conservatives attacked him for his belief in ""radical egalitarianism"" and ""judicial supremacy"" and for being ""perhaps the major threat to individual liberty"" in the United States, they got the scale right but the specifics wrong. A political philosophy formed the powerful bedrock of his opinions, as Robert Post, now dean of Yale Law School and a former Brennan clerk, argued in an essay the year after Brennan stepped down. But its roots lay in ""a vision of individuals uniformly equal before the Constitution"" whose implications conservatives misconstrued. The egalitarianism, far from radical, reflected the founding ideal of America, however imperfectly realized. In championing individualism, Brennan's approach was the opposite of a major threat to individual liberty. As for judicial supremacy, Brennan believed that ""the judicial function"" was ""the soul of government"" because the judiciary needed to protect individuals in conflicts with government. But opinions of his also called on a wider array of forces--the president and the executive branch, Congress, state legislatures, state supreme courts, federal and state bureaucracies--to uphold the same democratic principles in what Post calls a ""new vision of the American polity."" While the Supreme Court and the rest of the federal judiciary had greater responsibilities in this vision, every other element of government had its role. In their focus on Brennan the pragmatist, Wermiel and Stern can obscure just how optimistic and extraordinarily ambitious in scope his underlying philosophy was. At the same time, their emphasis on Brennan's practical--and highly effective--coalition-building in pursuit of consensus is a useful reminder of a core tenet of that vision: that all individuals deserve equal consideration. New York Times v. Sullivan is on every shortlist of contenders for the most important opinion Brennan ever wrote and the Warren Court handed down. It would be hard to find one more emblematic of his vision and the values that informed it. In 1964, speaking for a unanimous court, he revolutionized the law governing free speech, holding that a public official could recover damages for a statement about his official conduct only if he could prove the statement was made with ""knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not."" The decision brought together liberty, equality, and the vitality of American democracy because it started as a civil-rights case: The libel action against the newspaper was intended to chill its coverage of civil rights and the movement for racial equality. The ruling exemplified Brennan's pattern in major cases of putting his personal values aside in favor of what he thought was called for in law. Long after the opinion in the case was handed down, Brennan's attitude toward the press was often mistrustful and brusquely standoffish. His opinion also exemplified his moderation. Leading First Amendment scholars would have provided absolute immunity for speech about the business of governing. Brennan, by contrast, struck a balance between free expression (and its obvious contribution to democracy) and reputation (and its value to every individual). Still, in New York Times v. Sullivan, as he did in other First Amendment cases, he defended ""uninhibited, robust, and wide open"" debate, in particular in the press. Embracing this as a principle our democracy depends on, he defined an essential facet of American freedom. Like  Slate on Facebook. Follow  us on Twitter."

1	1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/would_you_like_to_leave_a_message.html	"The only question left to ponder, at the bizarre news of Ginni Thomas' ""olive branch"" phone call to Anita Hill, seeking an apology for ""what you did with my husband"" (not to but with--never mind) is: Why? Why would Ginni Thomas try to relitigate an issue that ripped this country apart in the fall of 1991, when her husband has life tenure at the Supreme Court and she has a merry band of Tea Partiers (and even merrier anonymous donors) hanging on her every word? What possible benefit could there be to leaving a cheerfully passive-aggressive 7:30 a.m. voice mail for a woman you have never even met? Beats me. But anyone who has followed Clarence and Ginni Thomas knows that isn't the first time they have tried to upend Anita Hill.  Back in 2007, when Justice Thomas published his autobiography,  My Grandfather's Son, he assailed  Hill's honesty, cited her mediocrity as an employee, and told 60 Minutes ""She was not the demure, religious, conservative person that they portrayed."" Ginni Thomas demanded an apology then as well. At the time, Hill was so stunned at the Thomases' need to rip open the old wound that she published a response in the New York Times and told the Boston Globe ""I am surprised he has held on to the anger for that long. ...  I'm surprised at the level of intensity 16 years later."" Now it's 19 years later, and apparently the Thomases' rage burns as hot as ever.  My Grandfather's Son is ample proof that Clarence Thomas lives and breathes umbrage, that no slight is forgiven, and no conspiracy theory too fanciful. Ginni Thomas, having spent three decades in the GOP policy trenches, knows a thing or two about umbrage and conspiracy theory as well. If her performance at Virginia's recent Tea Party convention is any indication, she believes the political world consists of the vicious liars in the mainstream media, the anti-democratic elitists in Washington, and a tiny bubble of goodness that is the Tea Party, her friends, and her husband. But even if the Thomas family is still mad as hell, that doesn't explain why she'd call in October of 2010 and demand repentance, does it? Some generous-hearted pundits have theorized that this was just woman-to-woman goodness: Ginni Thomas was truly reaching out in the spirit of reconciliation. I'm skeptical. The 7:30 voice mail accusing one of lying for two decades and requesting that one finally stop lying isn't in the top 50 dispute-resolution techniques I've researched. My friend Nancy Goldstein wonders if this was meant to distract from a New York Times story that ran the same day as the fateful phone call, questioning Ginni Thomas' 501(c)(4) organization, Liberty Central. Perhaps, although it's difficult to imagine Ms. Thomas delivering a blistering Tea Party speech on a Friday night, opening her New York Times the next morning, and thinking, ""Hey, maybe I'll call Anita Hill right this instant."" Moreover, as Goldstein notes, if this was intended to distract from the conflicts around Liberty Central, it didn't work, since Hill sat on the message for several days. It's also not clear why Ginni Thomas believes that re-arguing Thomas v. Hill 19 years later could possibly benefit Clarence Thomas. Yes, the Internet is buzzing today with claims that Prof. Hill, who never wanted to testify against Thomas in the first place and hasn't sought out any of these Desperate Housewives-style battles, is a liar and always was one. But the Washington Post has already found a former girlfriend of Justice Thomas' who claims that Hill's account of Thomas' behavior in the early 1980s is consistent with the Clarence Thomas she once dated. A new generation of Americans is being reminded of the fact that Hill took a polygraph test at the time of the hearings while Clarence Thomas did not. Anyone who ever read  Strange Justice, by Jill Abramson and Jane Mayer, is recalling the exhaustive research they put into establishing that Anita Hill had been smeared. There can be no doubt that the Thomases like American history a whole lot--whether it's Clarence Thomas' ideological vision of restoring the Constitution as originally written or Ginni Thomas' rhetorical longings for the golden days of the Framers. There's also little doubt that for each of them, what happened 19 years ago is still more urgent and relevant than anything that has happened since. The self-certainty inherent in Ginni Thomas' request that Hill ""get past"" the confirmation hearings by admitting to have lied about it is the same self-certainty that turned Thomas' autobiography into a painful taxonomy of insults, slurs, and slights. The cynic in me believes that there is no gender/race dispute the Tea Party is not willing to exploit for recruitment purposes, that reminding us all of the ugliest moment in American identity politics is no accident just two weeks before an election. The realist in me wonders whether Mrs. Thomas possibly believed this would stay private. She's a brilliant tactician and a superb communicator: She couldn't possibly have expected that ham-fisted attempt at reconciliation would have gone unreported. But the depressive in me suspects that Ginni Thomas simply doesn't care what any of us think of her attempt to reach out and touch someone she hates. Why would she? She and her husband long ago passed a point at which they worry about how they will be portrayed in the mainstream press. They stopped reading it years ago. They both live in a world in which the facts of Hill v. Thomas don't matter. There are no facts. There are just ""our"" beliefs and ""their"" beliefs, just as there is ""our"" media and ""theirs"" and ""our"" Civil War history and ""theirs."" To criticize either Thomas has always been to join in the imagined conspiracy against them. Why did Ginni Thomas make her strange call to Anita Hill? She may never explain it fully.  But those of us in the media who are pondering what she may have been trying to tell us should probably stop. This episode had nothing to do with us, and nothing to do with Hill, either. We are not in the Thomases' bubble, and we never will be. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	Why Ginni Thomas made that weird phone call to Anita Hill.	['Hill']	[]

That breaks my previous political-event-based houseguest record, when three people stayed with me to attend Barack Obama's inauguration. The difference is that the Obama inauguration was an occasion of genuine moment, while the Stewart-Colbert rally is shaping up to be the most successful pseudo-event in American history. I am delighted to host my far-flung loved ones, of whom I never see enough, and I enjoy watching Colbert and Stewart on TV, as I do often with my teenage kids. But I wish these two Comedy Central performers would cancel their rally and stay home. I have to wonder whether Stewart, at least, is starting to feel the same way. In an Oct. 4 appearance on NPR's Fresh Air (taped Sept. 29 at New York's 92nd St. Y), Stewart became uncharacteristically inarticulate:"	The case against the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear.

Joe Manchin can be spotted at 40 paces. He's the tallest and best-coiffed member of a well-dressed entourage moving inside for the only televised debate of this U.S. Senate campaign. He's the one inspiring two cheers and one jeer. ""Man-CHIN!"" chants one group of young Democrats with signs. ""Go Joe!"" chants another group. They are all waving Manchin's sign, which has his name gently rolling over a mountain. The Republicans are chanting something else: ""NOBAMA!"" Their biggest sign, bigger than their signs for Manchin's opponent, John Raese, is all black with white text: ""Obama Says 'Vote Democrat.' "" And there's your West Virginia campaign for U.S. Senate. On one side, an immensely popular governor, who has won 64 percent and 70 percent of the vote in his two bids for the office and who presides over a state with an unemployment rate a full point lower than the national average. It's about half what the rate was during the last great recession, in the early 1980s. ""If you look at West Virginia,"" Manchin says to reporters, ""who ever would have thought we'd be the financial beacon of hope for the country?"" On the other side of the ballot, though: a Republican. This is almost all that matters about him. Polls have President Obama's approval numbers here in the mid-20s. Even though cap-and-trade has gotten nowhere in the Senate, there is anger about the EPA; anger about guns; anger about what is seen as a war on the coal industry. Raese beat Manchin to the airwaves by five weeks, accusing him of being a ""rubber stamp for Obama."" But about coal. Drive through the state and you're buffeted with radio ads from the West Virginia Coal Association that explain how everyone is connected to the industry; they end with a dangerous-sounding male choir singing: ""Coooooooal is West Virginia!"" ""The coal industry,"" says West Virginia's AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Larry Matheney, ""has with little doubt succeeded in, uh, sharing its views with the public about the importance of coal."" Another ad features Mike Stuart, the state GOP chairman, delivering a monologue on how the state's habitual Democrats must wise up and vote Republican. ""Our country's broke, livin' on borrowed time and borrowed money,"" says Stuart, dramatizing his script like a War of the Worlds audio play. ""Liberals have the economy in a tailspin. Obama has been a terrible president. You have a right to be angry. Just like you, we're sick and tired of the liberals wasting our money. We can change it, but we need votes. Lots of votes."" The Democrats of West Virginia are not trying to survive by changing the voters' minds about all of this. Their strategy--Manchin's strategy--is to agree that their anger is legitimate, but to argue that the Democrats will channel it, too. In Morgantown, home to both West Virginia University and Raese's real estate and business empire, a semi-retiree named John Rittenhouse waits at a desk in The Living Room, the Christian sitting room he helps manage. On the TV, there's a never-ending tape of devotional quotes and music. On the walls, 12 stills from The Passion of the Christ. On a table, an assortment of baked goods, which will disappear once hard-up workers and homeless people arrive. Before they do, Rittenhouse explains that he wishes ""they'd abolish all the parties,"" but that he has to vote Republican this year. ""I'm really fed up with Obama,"" he says. ""I'm for anyone who's against Obama. I hate to say it, but I might vote a straight Republican ticket, because I don't believe in communism."" He has to vote against the Democrats for economic reasons, but it's tough. He likes Manchin. He likes Mike Oliverio, the Democratic state senator who knocked off Rep. Alan Mollohan in the spring primary and is now running a pro-life, anti-debt campaign. ""If either of them won, I could live with it,"" he allows, and that's partly because both candidates are pro-life Catholics who could possibly sympathize with Rittenhouse's view that evolution is a myth. ""I think we still have dinosaurs,"" he explains. ""All these so-called myths, and monsters, they're real."" Down I-79, in Manchin's home town of Fairmont, there's more openness to supporting his campaign. Inside the local Democratic club, where a $25 yearly membership fee will buy access to a bar, cafe, and slot machines, a retired Army translator named Andy Kavanaugh, drinking a $1.50 glass of Yuengling, gives Manchin credit for ""holding off the downturn in the state."" The Republican argument, he says, makes no sense. Manchin is the governor who made coal the state's official rock and who has never actually come out for cap-and-trade, only making some positive noise about a carbon tax. The argument that he'll turn into a rubber stamp for Obama, he says, doesn't jibe with Manchin's record. ""That's just fuckin' crazy,"" he says. ""He'll be good no matter what the hell he does."" But the Democrats, who own every lever of power in the state, can't count on that kind of faith anymore. I talked to Oliverio before the debate. Seated in his Morgantown office, wearing a polo shirt striped with the WVU colors, he gestured to a sign he has (there's an iPhone app, too) enumerating the size of the national debt. He launched his campaign in front of the office of public debt; he launched the campaign, in part, because polling showed that Alan Mollohan could no longer win, but a conservative Democrat could. This election, he says, is a chance to ""show the country what West Virginia Democrats are."" One example of that: ""The EPA is an agency of the federal government, not an agent acting on its own, and it has to realize that."" Once the debate starts, Manchin demonstrates the skill and strategy that could return him to the lead and make him West Virginia's next senator. The strategy is, more or less, class war. Manchin frames the debate as a choice between a rapacious businessman and a politician who name-checks FDR and Robert Byrd and speaks with pride about the earmarks and economic protections brought to West Virginia. Raese is a perfect foil. He has made three runs for statewide office, coming close twice but never winning. He has not responded to these setbacks by moderating his views or thawing out his speaking style. It's the speaking style of a very well-off and well-educated man, not a bellowing populist. In the debate with Manchin, Raese leans on the phrase ""I find that concerning."" He knocks Manchin's spending habits by saying ""he is for stimulus, here, in the country."" And he pronounced global warming ""a myth, I say, a myth."" It feels like the manager of a rock band deciding that this gig can't be so hard, and awkwardly trying it out himself. The Democrats' hope is that Raese misses his opportunities to out-populist Manchin. It nearly happens in the debate. Raese answers a question about the minimum wage--the Manchin team has tried to make an issue out of his opposition to it--by arguing that abolishing the minimum wage would lead to higher wages. ""I want a better wage for everybody,"" says Raese, ""and we have, in this country, to start lifting jobs and manufacturing where they should be. Not like Manchin and Obama. They enjoy people working for $7.25."" In a great year for his party, Raese isn't doing anything to soften or disguise a hard ideological libertarianism. Manchin sees an opening there, a way to blunt the Republican surge by selling himself as a budget-cutting, job-creating New Dealer, if there can be such a thing.""I'm sure that [Raese] opposed regulations on Wall Street, too,"" says Manchin after the debate. ""This recession didn't happen because someone was trying to meet the needs of Main Street. It was because of the greed of Wall Street.""There is some space for Democrats to win here. The Republican surge in West Virginia, as much as it is in other states, is not based just on anger about the economy, but on anger that the Democrats have done too much for Wall Street and have cut Medicare to pay for health care. Those are not conservative positions, per se. They just make voters furious. And I asked Manchin how he can convince angry voters, who are pledging to boot any and all incumbents and Democrats, that they can hate the establishment and still vote for him.""I am asking them to think,"" he says.

Thiel was the first outside investor in Facebook, putting up $500,000 to finance the site's original expansion in 2004. In the film's version of events, he connives with Sean Parker, the founder of Napster, to deprive Mark Zuckerberg's friend Eduardo Saverin of his 30 percent stake in the company. Though the character based on Thiel appears on-screen only briefly, Aaron Sorkin's screenplay demolishes the German-born venture-capitalist in a single line: ""We're in the offices of a guy whose hero is Gordon Gekko."" While he clearly enjoys playing Richie Rich--various profiles have commented on his Ferrari Spyder, his $500,000 McLaren Supercar, an apartment in the San Francisco Four Seasons, and a white-jacketed butler--Thiel fancies himself more than another self-indulgent tech billionaire. He has a big vision and has lately been spending some of the millions he has made on PayPal, Facebook, and a hedge fund called Clarium trying to advance it. Thiel's philosophy demands attention not because it is original or interesting in any way--it's puerile libertarianism, infused with futurist fantasy--but because it epitomizes an ugly side of Silicon Valley's politics. To describe Peter Thiel as simply a libertarian wildly understates the case. His belief system is based on unapologetic selfishness and economic Darwinism. His most famous quote--borrowed from Vince Lombardi--is, ""Show me a good loser and I'll show you a loser."" In  a personal statement produced last year for the Cato Institute *, Thiel announced: ""I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible."" The public, he says, doesn't support unregulated, winner-take-all capitalism and so he doesn't support the public making decisions. This anti-democratic proclamation comes with some curious historical analysis. Thiel says that the Roaring 20s were the last period when it was possible for supporters of freedom like him to be optimistic about politics. ""Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women--two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians--have rendered the notion of 'capitalist democracy' into an oxymoron,"" he writes. If you want to go around saying that giving women the vote wrecked the country and still be taken seriously , it helps to be handing out $100 bills. What differentiates Thiel's Silicon Valley style of philanthropic libertarianism from Glenn Beck's screaming-raving-weeping variety is a laissez-faire attitude toward personal behavior and the lack of any demagogic instinct. Thiel, who is openly gay, wants to flee the mob, not rally it through gold-hoarding or flag-waving.  Having given up hope for American democracy, he writes that he has decided to focus ""my efforts on new technologies that may create a new space for freedom."" Both his entrepreneurship and his philanthropy have been animated by techno-utopianism. In founding PayPal, which made his first fortune when he sold it to eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002, Thiel sought to create a global currency beyond the reach of taxation or central bank policy. He likewise sees Facebook as a way to form voluntary supra-national communities. Offline, Thiel is the lead backer of Seasteading, a movement to create law-free floating communes based on voluntary association. Led by Milton Friedman's pajama-wearing  grandson,  this may be the most elaborate effort ever devised by a group of computer nerds to get invited to an orgy. (Let's build our own Deepwater Horizon with legal prostitution!) Thiel is also an investor in space exploration, with the avowed aim of creating new political structures even farther offshore. That could take some time, but Thiel--who loves robots and science fiction--has a plan for that, too. He has given millions to the Methuselah Foundation, which does research into life-extension based on the premise that humans can live to be 1,000 years old. At PayPal, he proposed making cryogenic storage an employee perk. It should be noted that Thiel has also supported some genuinely good and useful causes, like the Committee to Protect Journalists. But Thiel's latest crusade is his worst yet, and more troubling than the possibility of an unfrozen caveman venture capitalist awaking in the 22nd century and demanding his space capsule. The Thiel Fellowship will pay would-be entrepreneurs under 20 $100,000 in cash to drop out of school. In announcing the program, Thiel made clear his contempt for American universities which, like governments, he believes, cost more than they're worth and hinder what really matters in life, namely starting tech companies. His scholarships are meant as an escape hatch from these insufficiently capitalist institutions of higher learning. Where to start with this nasty idea? A basic feature of the venture capitalist's worldview is its narcissism, and with that comes the desire to clone oneself--perhaps literally in Thiel's case. Thus Thiel fellows will have the opportunity to emulate their sponsor by halting their intellectual development around the onset of adulthood, maintaining a narrow-minded focus on getting rich as young as possible, and thereby avoid the siren lure of helping others or contributing to the advances in basic science that have made the great tech fortunes possible. Thiel's program is premised on the idea that America suffers from a deficiency of entrepreneurship. In fact, we may be on the verge of the opposite, a world in which too many weak ideas find funding and every kid dreams of being the next Mark Zuckerberg. This threatens to turn the risk-taking startup model into a white boy's version of the NBA, diverting a generation of young people from the love of knowledge for its own sake and respect for middle-class values. There is, of course, another model of Silicon Valley politics, which finds its exemplars in the clean-tech race, in Google's self-driving cars and wind farms, and Bill Gates' philanthropy. Zuckerberg too shows signs of actually caring about other people, having just donated $100 million to support change in Newark's blighted public schools system--as opposed, to say, an orbiting satellite base for unregulated short-selling. Tech prodigies sometimes grow up late. Perhaps Peter Thiel will one day as well. Correction, Oct. 17, 2010: This article orginally referred to the Cato Institute as the Cato Foundation.

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/anger_aspenstyle.html	"GLENWOOD SPRINGS, Colo.--Sooner or later, if you are a member of the United States Senate, you will be asked why the government won't pay for Viagra. On Wednesday, at a meet-and-greet in this scenic resort town, it was Michael Bennet's turn. It didn't start too badly. Bennet, the incumbent Democrat who trails his Republican opponent Ken Buck, had just finished a short speech to a crowd of gray-haired liberals at the Glenwood Canyon Brewing Co. An excitable man named Jim Preston got up and informed the senator that he spent two and a half hours making campaign calls and that everyone should do this. ""There's a lot of anger out there,"" said Preston. ""I was very surprised. You have to learn to restrain yourself. There's a lot of support, but there's a lot of hang-ups. People yell at you."" Bennet nodded. Preston kept talking. ""You know, I'm 73 years old, I'm divorced, and I still like to have sex once in a while."" Bennet interjected: ""This is an advertisement first for phone-banking, and now for ..."" Preston ignored the stop sign. ""In order to have sex, I need some help,"" he said. But under the new health care law, he says, it will be harder for him to get Medicare to reimburse him for Viagra. ""In the Congress, somebody figured out that you could get some votes by saying, 'Oh no, we can't have 73-year-old people, you know, on the dole for sex.' And now I have to pay full price!"" Craig Chisesi, an air-water-solar technician in a Hawaiian-patterned shirt and sandals, who had been listening intently, leaned over to me. ""Now I know why they hung up on him,"" he said. ""All right,"" said Bennet. ""On the, uh, on the phone calls ..."" That got a laugh. On the stump, Bennet has two modes: concerned and dryly humorous. Here was a chance to test out both of those modes. And his answer sounded like his answer to almost everything: Isn't it a shame that people can't get along? ""You know, it is important to hear what folks have to say,"" he said. ""You know, part of the problem that we have right now is that too many of us have stopped listening to each other."" On other subjects, Bennet showed more of an edge. On the Senate: ""I wish I could report to you that it's less dysfunctional than it appears to be. It's not. It's more dysfunctional."" On the campaign ads: ""We have actually run millions of dollars of positive ads. No one remembers them."" On America as a superpower: ""We really squandered the first decade of this century, economically."" All of the political energy in 2010 is with the angry voter and the angry candidate, who have run out of words to describe how much they hate Washington. Bennet's response has been to tell these voters that they're right--just not right in the way they think they are. They focus too much on the silly parts of Washington (say, Medicare reimbursement policies for Viagra) and not enough on more fundamental issues (say, how dysfunctional the Senate really is). This is a point Bennet has been making for his entire, brief, career in electoral politics. Appointed in January 2009 by Gov. Bill Ritter, Bennet quickly earned the ire of progressive activists who thought he was soft and indecisive about their priorities, like union card check or the stimulus package. When he became more responsive to them--egged on by a primary challenge from the left--he opened himself to the line of attack Republicans have been using against him for almost two years now. It's neatly packaged in an ad from Americans for Job Security, which displays a map of the Senate and informs the audience that Bennet provided ""the deciding vote"" for Democrats. Bennet, who speaks slowly and languidly, and who dresses for the trail as if he's about to head out camping, is not exactly making a case for what Democrats have actually accomplished. His TV ads ignore the record of the 111th Congress for decidedly piecemeal reforms, like capping congressional pay raises and cracking down on fancy trips. Bennet, after dutifully helping carry the Democratic agenda, is running on a dream of what the Democrats could have done. The Republicans here are dreaming, too. Bennet's opponent, Weld County District Attorney Ken Buck, has led in polling ever since both men won their parties' nominations. In Buck's telling, the Democrats haven't been hampered at all. They've been power-mad, passing bills like the Affordable Care Act that bureaucrats are going to make worse. ""What we thought was only a 2,400-page health care bill is actually thousands of pages longer,"" he said. ""The good news is that it's getting less popular as time goes on."" Lumped in with the rest of the Tea Party movement, compared to deeply flawed candidates like Sharron Angle in Nevada and Christine O'Donnell in Delaware, Buck is extraordinarily smooth, with the sort of state-fair humor that plays well with Republican audiences. He spent Wednesday on a ""grassroots tour"" of state GOP offices, and at his first stop in ultra-Republican Highlands Ranch, he used 30 seconds of a five-minute speech to lead a chorus of ""Happy Birthday"" to a volunteer's daughter. While he spoke, he wore a microphone for a Christian Broadcasting Network story; after he spoke, a body man watched and warded off eavesdroppers, and Buck took one-on-one questions. He has something in common with Bennet: An eagerness to answer voter anger with a project or idea that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with what's making them angry. What could Republicans do immediately, I asked Buck, if they take power and want to start creating jobs? ""I think we've got to get the discussion going on a balanced budget amendment,"" he said. It's not just that the job-creating benefits of that idea are unclear. It's not clear that voters, as much as they rage against the debt, really want deep budget cuts. As Buck shook hands and kept a polite distance from the press, former Douglas County Sheriff Mike Acree explained to me why he'll be voting against ballot initiatives that other conservatives support. Key among them: Measure 61, which would prevent the state from borrowing or bonding. ""If they pass that,"" said Acree, ""we're not going to be able to pay for police and firefighters. If those other measures pass, I think it would hurt local businesses."" I asked Acree whether he thinks Colorado's ready for Buck and the GOP ticket, who promise tax cuts and balanced budgeting, and who opposed deficit spending, via the stimulus, to bail out the state. He does. He's confident that they'll cut ""some of the social spending,"" not funding for services. That's what's swinging the Colorado voters who boosted Democrats for the last six years: total disappointment in what that party achieved and the hope that Republicans will cut waste without touching anything important. So far in this campaign, Republicans--Buck especially--have lived up to those hopes by backing off some more daring conservative ideas like replacing the income tax with a national sales tax. After appearing to support a national sales tax, Buck said he only found it ""interesting,"" a stance he repeated to me. That hasn't stopped Democrats, given a respite from defending or explaining their failures while in power, from turning it right back on him. ""He says I take him out of context,"" shrugged Bennet. ""I don't know what that means unless 'context' means, 'What he said in the Republican primary.' "" If the election is between Bennet's vision of what the Democrats should have done and Buck's promises of what the GOP will and won't do, Bennet has a chance. Michelle Obama and Bill Clinton are campaigning for him. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is spending money here. Democrats claim that Bennet's up in their internal polls. But it's Buck who has the easier carry, and the more direct path to the voter's spleen. All he has to do is promise voters that he'll improve on the Democrats. That's pretty much what Bennet is saying. But how, exactly, does a Democrat say that?Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

With all the controversy still swirling around whether the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is using foreign money to fund its $75 million effort to support Republican Congressional candidates, the secrecy of Karl Rove's new political groups, and the emergence of new groups with anodyne-sounding names like the ""Coalition to Protect Seniors,"" it's worth stepping back and asking why federal law requires campaign finance disclosure in the first place. Do we still need these laws? Do they work the way they're supposed to? For years, federal campaigns took place without effective disclosure laws. After Watergate, with its revelations of secret illegal corporate cash being funneled to candidates and with paper bags full of campaign money, Congress finally passed a law in 1974 requiring disclosure of contributions to candidates and political committees and the spending these groups engaged in. At this point, most political players were candidates, political parties or political action committees, and they all were subject to the disclosure rules. For a long time following, there was a virtual consensus in Congress that disclosure was the way to keep campaigns clean. But, in recent years, as the Supreme Court has struck down more limits on election spending, the consensus has unraveled. Emboldened, opponents of campaign finance regulation have gone after disclosure, too. Their arguments are not new. As soon as Congress passed its 1974 disclosure laws, a coalition of plaintiffs, including the ACLU, challenged the requirements as overly broad. They argued that at least some disclosure is unconstitutional under the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech and association, because compelling someone to reveal who is funding political speech will chill vigorous participation in politics. The Supreme Court rejected that constitutional challenge in the 1976 campaign finance case, Buckley v. Valeo. Confronted with a law that required disclosure of even very small contributions, the court held that the disclosure laws were justified by three important government interests. First, disclosure laws can prevent corruption and the appearance of corruption. Having no more paper bags of cash makes it harder to bribe a member of Congress. Second, disclosure laws provide valuable information to voters.  A busy public relies on disclosure information more than ever. This was apparent when California voters recently turned down a ballot proposition which would have benefited Pacific Gas and Electric. PG&E provided almost all of the $46 million to the ""Yes on 16"" campaign, compared with very little spent opposing the measure. Thanks to California's disclosure laws, PG&E's name appeared on every ""Yes on 16"" ad and the measure narrowly went down to defeat. Third, disclosure laws helpenforce other campaign finance laws. Worried about foreign money in elections? Disclosure tells you how much is coming in. Still, after Buckley, the Supreme Court recognized that groups that face threats of harassment from either the government or private sources should have a constitutional right to be exempt from the disclosure laws. In 1982, the Court held that the Socialist Workers Party, which had faced FBI and other harassment, did not have to disclose their contributors to the FEC. This is a narrow exemption for very unpopular groups. But opponents of disclosure have continued to argue that chilling is a problem that affects not just these marginal groups but everyone who might contribute to a political cause. This argument seemed to gain some traction in the Internet era. No longer is it necessary to trudge down to a government office to wade through disclosure reports. With a Web site like Fundrace, you can plug in your home address (or any address) and see to whom (and how much) your neighbors have donated in federal races. Same-sex marriage advocates created Eightmaps to find Californians who donated to ""Yes on 8,"" as in Proposition 8, the ballot measure outlawing gay unions. There's an ongoing lawsuit over whether these Proposition 8 contributors should have been exempt from disclosing their names because of allegations that they have suffered economic boycotts, lost their jobs, and even faced the threat of violence. The Supreme Court will eventually have to grapple with whether the Internet changes the constitutional calculus--in other words, whether the ease with which we can now discover who has contributed to what means that people won't feel free to give and whether that outweighs the societal benefit of disclosure in preventing corruption, informing voters, and helping to enforce other campaign finance laws. In two cases last term, however, the court reaffirmed its strong support for disclosure rules. In Citizens United, the court struck down limits on corporate spending in campaigns; and at the same time, in an 8-1 vote, it endorsed disclosure as the better solution to preventing corruption from large spending. By the same 8-1 count, the court also, last term in Doe v. Reed, rejected an argument in a case similar to the Proposition 8 suit. The court ruled that Washington state residents who signed a petition for a voter referendum that would reverse an ""everything but marriage"" same-sex union law could not shield their identities. In these cases, only Justice Clarence Thomas argued for a completely deregulated campaign finance system: no limits and no disclosure. But that doesn't mean that the question of disclosure in the Internet era is really settled. The Reed majority was fractured, with six of the eight justices writing opinions--plus Thomas in dissent. At the end of the spectrum close to Thomas, Justice Alito suggested that disclosure in the Internet era can chill political activity and argued that exemptions like the one the court allowed for the Socialist Workers Party should be easy to get. On the other end, Justice Scalia strongly supported disclosure laws, writing that ""[r]equiring people to stand up in public for their political acts fosters civic courage, without which democracy is doomed."" The truth is probably somewhere in the middle. As law professors  Bill McGeveran and Richard Briffault have persuasively argued, the Internet does have the potential to make individual small contributors skittish about political activity. So we should raise the threshold for disclosure, requiring it for larger contributors and spenders and leaving out the small timers. That is a far cry from the way disclosure is actually working. Since they haven't made real headway in court, groups that don't want to reveal the identities of their donors look for ways to avoid the mess of regulations that requires it. The Chamber of Commerce says it won't disclose the names of donors funding its multimillion-dollar political advertising blitz because it fears its members will be harassed. But the real reason is probably that the businesses that belong to the chamber don't want to lose customers for taking controversial positions, as Target recently experienced when it backed an anti-gay candidate in Minnesota. The disclosure chase has become a kind of Whac-A-Mole whereby groups that want to avoid disclosure choose different organizational forms in the tax code to hide donors. Before Congress passed the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reforms in 2002, groups avoided disclosure by refraining from expressly advocating for the election or defeat of a candidate. For example, in the 2000 election, a group called ""Republicans for Clean Air"" spent money in the New York presidential primary knocking John McCain's environmental record to support the candidacy of George W. Bush. It turned out (and we know this thanks to some enterprising journalists) that Republicans for Clean Air was none other than Sam and Charles Wyly, two Texas supporters of Bush. Since their ads didn't say ""don't vote for McCain,"" they didn't disclose their identities. McCain-Feingold and other changes Congress made to the tax code at first put an end to this disclosure dodging. But the fixes only worked for a while. With the help of three Republican Commissioners at the Federal Election Commission, opponents of disclosure have found new ways around the law. This campaign season, the action has moved to 501(c)(4)s. This type of nonprofit generally must report contributions above $5,000 to the IRS--but that information is not made public. This really does open the spigot: For example, as I predicted, funding to the Rove political group American Crossroads skyrocketed when he opened up a 501(c)(4) affiliate, Crossroads GPS, to take anonymous donations. The Chamber, meanwhile, is a 501(c)(6) trade association, and it, too, does not have to disclose its members or their contributions publicly. All of these groups, and anyone else spending least $10,000 in TV or radio ads mentioning a candidate in the period close to an election, have to file public reports with the Federal Election Commission detailing their spending. But thanks to the FEC, no one needs to disclose who has contributed to pay for these ads, unless the donor is dumb enough specifically to direct the organization to use the money for a particular ad. This system just begs political operatives to set up innocuous-sounding front groups to launder contributions for ads. This is what pro-disclosure reformers are up-in-arms about. They are filing complaints alleging that the 501(c)(4)s with the bland names are violating tax law because their primary purpose is politics rather than whatever they've declared it to be in the IRS paperwork that got them nonprofit status. But there are two problems with these complaints. We don't know what a group's primary purpose is until it's had a chance to spend money over a year and we can see what share went for political activities. Also, the IRS rules are far from clear as to how to measure ""primary purpose."" The bottom line is that the 2010 election will be over long before the IRS decides whether the Coalition to Protect Seniors and its ilk are breaking the law. The same thing happened in the 2004 cycle, when Republicans complained that certain Democratic-leaning organizations were really political committees that the FEC should have regulated. By the time the complaints went anywhere and the groups were ordered to pay fines, they had stopped being politically active. Democrats in Congress have proposed tightening up these rules yet again in the DISCLOSE Act, but they larded up the bill with new limits on corporate political activities and no Republicans were willing to back even a straight disclosure bill. Even if the bill passed, it's not clear that it would solve the problem. It doesn't bar secret contributions to nonprofit veterans organizations, leading to speculation that they could be the new front groups.This election season, enterprising journalists, especially at the New York Times, have been digging into the shell game of contributions and spending, including activities by the American Future Fund, Crossroads GPS, and Americans for Job Security.  The most important piece the Times has run, by Mike McIntire, demonstrated in vivid detail just how hard it is to follow the money without disclosure rules strongly enforced by the government. * As McIntire explains, after his extensive investigation into the backers of the ""Coalition to Protect Seniors"" led him to P.O. boxes and unanswered e-mails, it looked as if the health care industry might be behind an ad the group ran attacking the president's health care plan. But in all likelihood, we'll never know for sure. That's how porous our disclosure rules have become. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter.

7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/a_new_plan_for_afghanistan.html	"Officials say a shift in U.S. war strategy has begun to take place in Afghanistan, away from classic counterinsurgency (protecting the population, providing basic services, promoting good government) and toward the traditional business of killing and capturing bad guys. Counterinsurgency (or COIN, as it's often called) is hardly dead. Many U.S. troops are still very much engaged in COIN operations. A surge of civilian officials and advisers, from several NATO countries, is well under way in Kabul's ministries in and several provincial districts. And COIN is seen as vital to Afghanistan's long-term stability. However, U.S. and NATO officers, intelligence analysts, and other officials and advisers now believe that our objectives in the Afghanistan war can no longer be accomplished in sufficiently short time through COIN alone or even through a COIN-dominant strategy. Hence the huge increase, just in the last three months, of military attacks--by drones, aircraft-launched smart bombs, and special-operations forces on the ground--against Taliban soldiers and, in many cases, specific midlevel Taliban leaders. The intended effect is the same: to apply pressure on the Taliban insurgents, disrupt their command-control networks, create fissures between the insurgents fighting in the field and their leaders across the border in Pakistan--to the point where many of them surrender or negotiate a reconciliation with the Afghan government. Under classic COIN strategy, this process would take place slowly but steadily, as the presence of security forces and the supply of basic services boost popular allegiance to the Afghan government, which in turn dries up the base of support for the insurgents. However, it is now calculated, even by many COIN advocates, that this process would take too long--and be too corrupted by Afghan politics--to work in any practical sense. As for the timing, President Barack Obama has repeatedly said that his much-publicized deadline of July 2011 will mark only the beginning of a U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan and that the scope and pace of the pullout will be determined by conditions on the ground. Still, it's clear that domestic support for this war is winding down. Some senior White House advisers (though just some) are seeking any excuse for an exit. In any case, the time needed for success through a COIN campaign alone--another six to 10 years, or more, the strategy's most avid supporters estimate--is seen as politically unsustainable. As for Afghan politics, COIN can succeed only by, with, and through the host government; U.S. troops in a COIN operation are--and advertise themselves to be--fighting on behalf of the host government. And yet, by all official accounts, Afghan President Hamid Karzai's government is so distrusted by its own people--and so incompetent at (or uninterested in) providing services--that it cannot really serve as a reliable partner in a COIN campaign. So, U.S. and NATO forces are concentrating more on a different, possibly faster, explicitly more forceful means of pressuring the Taliban to the negotiating tables. Airstrikes and commando killings have always been part of the operation. By the same token, COIN is still a part of this ramped-up killing campaign. Without the security provided by lots of U.S. troops on the ground--and without the human intelligence that these troops cultivate among the local population--the special-ops forces wouldn't be able to function, and the air and drone pilots wouldn't know where their targets were. The two strategies--counterinsurgency and counterterrorism--are, in this sense, connected. What's recently changed is the emphasis on each, not just in degree and intensity but also in terms of which approach is seen as the spearhead to achieving the war's objectives. This shift in emphasis is not a subtle matter; it is altering the character of this war. The Army's field manual on counterinsurgency--which was co-written by Gen. David Petraeus, who is now U.S. commander in Afghanistan--notes that COIN wars are ""protracted by nature"" and that they require ""firm political will and extreme patience,"" as well as ""considerable expenditure of time and resources."" It orders all soldiers and officers to focus on protecting the population and to put much less priority on ""killing and capturing the enemy."" At one point, the manual advises its readers: ""Only attack insurgents when they get in the way."" Since taking command of the Afghanistan war, Petraeus has said that Taliban fighters and their commanders wouldn't seek a deal unless they thought they were losing. But in recent weeks, he has substantially stepped up this side of the campaign--the business of ""killing and capturing the enemy,"" which his field manual discouraged--to make the insurgents perceive that they're losing much more quickly. ""Petraeus is unleashing the special-ops guys,"" one U.S. official told me, in every area of Afghanistan where the Taliban are in force: north, east, and south. It's not just special-ops troops. According to the latest unclassified Air Force data, U.S. warplanes and drones dropped or fired 1,600 weapons on Afghan targets in the last three months, nearly half of them--700--in September alone. In the same three months last year, just 1,031 aerial weapons were released, 257 of them in that September. (Though the data are not entirely clear, it appears this more aggressive strategy has not resulted in an increase of civilian casualties. For more on this point, click here.) This new twist in the strategy seems to be having some effect. One senior officer said (and other officials confirmed) that 300 midlevel Taliban have been killed or captured in the last three months, including a number of shadow provincial governors, district commanders, and trainers or facilitators in the use of roadside bombs. In addition, more than 800 rank-and-file insurgents have been killed, and more than 2,000 have been captured. Intelligence intercepts indicate that Taliban insurgents in the field are more scattered and confused, that their leaders are slow to send new unit commanders when the old ones have been killed, and that the replacements are often less competent. There have also been ""a couple dozen instances"" of surrenders, a senior officer said, involving anywhere from a handful to several dozen insurgents. In one incident still ongoing, about 200 insurgents who had been fighting in southern Helmand province marched northwest to Herat in order to surrender. The officer stopped short of claiming that these surrenders signaled a large-scale or higher-level co-optation to come. First, those 200 insurgents marched from Helmand to Herat in order to evade reprisals from other Taliban--a sign that, even among those willing to do so, surrendering is risky. Second, Afghan fighters have a long tradition of switching sides and switching back again (see the first chapter of Dexter Filkins' excellent book,  The Forever War); those who surrender today might be back on the fighting fields tomorrow. Still, the trends are unmistakable. One U.S. official, who has been very skeptical about the war in the past, said in a recent e-mail: ""There's a reasonable strategy in place with a reasonable chance for reasonable success."" A NATO adviser, who was downright pessimistic three months ago, said, ""I'm now a glass-half-full guy."" Two caveats, which these same sources are quick to point out: First, these comments are laced in caution; they're not at all fist-in-the-air yelps of victory. Second, they speak to tactical progress, not strategic success. If the airstrikes and special-ops raids continue to kill insurgents, ratchet up the pressure on the survivors, and force Taliban leaders to the negotiating table, that's hardly the end of the game. What kind of deal will these Taliban negotiate? One condition Gen. Petraeus has set is that any Taliban seeking reconciliation must pledge to support Afghanistan's constitution and elected leaders. If they do so, will they cross their fingers and soon break the deal? Although U.S. troops might stick around to help enforce such accords, the ultimate guarantor must be Karzai. Will he hold up his end of the bargain without either demanding too much obeisance or cravenly caving in? Finally, in order for any deal to take hold and result in political stability, there must be economic growth, credible institutions of justice, and a steady flow of basic services to the population. In that sense, COIN theory is still valid--and that leads back to the original concerns that have made a COIN campaign so slow and difficult: How can growth, good government, and basic services develop if the regime lacks political legitimacy? There's another wild card, rarely addressed in these sorts of discussions: the fighters of the Northern Alliance, the former insurgency group that helped U.S. special-ops forces overthrow Afghanistan's Taliban regime in 2002. These fighters disarmed when Karzai came to power, but some intelligence analysts--and Afghans--worry that they might take up arms again if the Taliban were to come back into the government as part of a power-sharing deal. If that happens, civil war could once again break out. The path to the end of this war is suddenly a bit clearer, but how this thing ends and what happens afterward remain as murky as ever.

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/in_the_tank.html	"PUEBLO, Colo.--When Tom Tancredo arrives at his newest campaign office, the would-be governor of Colorado will have to sign some books. Copies of his book  In Mortal Danger are on display and for sale, opened to the title page, ready to be Sharpied. Next to them are new, silkscreened shirts that portray a tank moving across a white plain. It's a cartoon in three panels. ""I think I can!"" reads the caption under the first tank. ""I think I can!"" reads the caption under the second. And then there's a picture of a tank firing off a volley. ""I KNOW I can!"" reads the caption. It's the story, says volunteer Connie Traux, of Tancredo's campaign for governor. In case it's too subtle, she clarifies it. ""He sure as hell can!"" she says. ""Rasmussen moved the race from 'safe' Democrat to 'lean' Democrat,"" says volunteer Stephen Hodge, revving up another Tanc fan at the office. ""He's about where Scott Brown was before he won, so it can be done."" In another election, with another candidate, this would seem silly. (It's not totally bereft of silliness as it is.) The man who singlehandedly turned weeks of the 2008 presidential primary season into immigration debates? Mr. ""Miami is a Third World country""? Mr. Literacy Test for Voting? But this really is the gubernatorial election that Colorado is stuck with, with Tancredo running a strong second place as a third-party candidate--and rising. This is a surprise to everyone. For most of the year, Republicans expected former Rep. Scott McInnis to be their nominee against John Hickenlooper, the wonky and slapsticky mayor of Denver. (One of his TV ads shows him ""washing off' negative ads in a shower, fully clothed; another portrays him accidentally entering a rodeo.) And then, as has happened so many times in 2010, the candidate imploded. McInnis was revealed to be a serial plagiarizer, but the news broke too close to the primary for him to be removed from the ballot. So Colorado Republicans engaged in a game of chicken. McInnis' name stayed on the ballot, with the implicit understanding that if he won, the party leaders would replace him. But Dan Maes, a modestly successful businessman who had performed well in pre-primary caucuses, was on the ballot, too. Maes won. Thus began a pathetic scramble by Republican leaders to get Maes to quit, followed by him not quitting, followed by Tancredo jumping into the race as the Constitution Party's candidate and tearing Maes apart. As soon as Maes started falling in the polls, Tancredo started being taken seriously. ""On Election Day,"" the GOP's candidate for Congress in the Denver-based 1st Congressional District tells me, ""I will vote for the most conservative candidate who has a chance to win."" No need, or no attempt, to pretend he'll back the Republican. When Tancredo arrives at his new Pueblo outpost, he is greeted by Republican Party exiles he's known for years. They are handing out fliers for a Saturday ""Republican round-up,"" illustrated with a cartoon of Tancredo wrangling elephants with a lasso. Tancredo's supporters are far harsher on Maes than Tancredo is. ""Dan Maes is that little boy that wanted to fly so he climbed up on a roof and jumped off,"" says Frances Mathews, a long-time Pueblo County activist who gets a long hug from the former member of Congress. She cribs a line from her candidate to explain what's wrong with Maes: ""They ought to have a literacy test for people who want to run for office."" Tancredo has arrived from a pheasant hunt; he has not had time to shave or change out of muddy boots. He signs books, compliments T-shirts, and informs the crowd that he has momentum--but worries about whether enough Republicans will abandon their party for him. On the way to the debate, where he plans to use the facilities to clean up and shower, he explains why they might be stuck on Maes. ""The Tea Party folks, a lot of them, got into this in a different way than the usual Republican or Democrat,"" Tancredo tells me. ""They got into this with a lot of emotion. They were building a  Mr. Smith Goes to Washington story. They put in a lot of effort, and when Maes starts to fall in the polls and gets attacked, they feel like they're being attacked. I don't know what it takes to overcome that, or if we can."" That's the phenomenon that's boosted Tea Party candidates in every other state this year. On Tuesday, Sharron Angle, running against Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. announced that she had raised $14 million in the third quarter, in no small part due to how she presented herself as a giant-killer under duress from the giant. Rep. Michele Bachmann raised $5.4 million the same way, and Christine O'Donnell raised at least $2 million as liberals mocked her on TV. Before the Pueblo debate, as Tancredo straightens himself up, a contingent of Maes fans in red shirts (slogan: ""The Peoples' Candidate"") sit and grumble about how their man gets treated. ""He's human,"" says Owen Dean. ""He's a political amateur. That's one of the things I like about him."" Don't the Maes fans worry that they'll elect Hickenlooper? ""If that happens,"" says Barbara Mattison, ""it will be the Republicans' fault."" And what a thing to pin on them! If the rage of the Tea Party leads to a Tancredo/Maes split vote, it will elect a man who could have otherwise been an irresistible target. In their debate, Tancredo and Maes argue that government needed deep cuts; that Colorado needed Arizona-style immigration reform; that, in Tancredo's words, ""there's no energy in a green economy and no jobs."" Hickenlooper rejects all of that and rejects three conservative ballot measures broadly supported by Tancredo and the Tea Party. He either declines to try, or fails, to match Tancredo and Maes on populist anger. Instead, he tells winding anecdotes about his experience as a brewer and restaurant owner. When immigration comes up, he punts, looks at Tancredo, and says, ""I learned a long time ago not to debate the congressman on this."" ""I am learning to be a better debater,"" he says sheepishly in his closing remarks. ""It's hard to talk about things in one-minute, two-minute slices, right?"" he explains to me when the whole thing is over. ""You have to have a two-minute closing? Heck, I spent my life, or at least the last 15 years, in restaurants, trying to convince customers to sit there another four or five minutes so they'd buy dessert."" Hickenlooper might not need to win debates. Unless Tancredo takes all of Maes' votes, the Tea Party/conservative fratricide will actually save the Democrats. Maes calls the Tancredo surge a ""mirage."" But he's haunted by it. When the debate moderator reminds the audience that Maes did not participate in a coin toss to decide who'd close--Maes, star-crossed as ever, got stuck in a traffic jam caused by an escaping prisoner--he tries to turn it into a joke. ""Did I lose?"" says Maes. ""Not yet!"" yells a heckler. ""Oh, come on!"" says Maes. He sighs. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

Plastic drink cups are suitable for bathing. Straws can knock a man down. So it's not a surprise that when Joe Heck, the Republican candidate for Congress in Nevada's Third District, campaigns at a 7-Eleven here, voters want to talk about the Big Race. What does he think about the battle between Harry Reid and Sharron Angle? You can't blame them for asking. Even people outside Nevada are obsessed with this race. Reid, the Senate majority leader, would be the biggest Republican prize of the year. Angle, a Tea Party favorite, seems to be trying to prove just how durable she is by setting off little explosions to distract her campaign. Last week started with a leaked private audiotape and ended with Angle claiming Sharia law had taken hold in two American cities, one of which does not exist. Heck, a Republican, is just trying to do his own thing. He's at the convenience store holding a ""Joe Knows Jobs"" event, meant to show that he is focused on the only issue voters care about. When voters ask him about Angle or Reid he doesn't offer an opinion about either one. He plays pundit, saying the race is going to be close. When a woman says she's worried Angle will take away her Social Security, Heck doesn't defend his fellow Republican. He simply says the program should be protected. Finally, a voter asks him directly: ""Who are you going to vote for?"" He says he's still making up his mind. ""I'm waiting to see all of the evidence before I make my choice,"" he says. That Heck would even contemplate voting for Reid would shock any visitor to his Web site, which is also obsessed with the Reid/Angle race. Across the top blares this quote from none other than Mitt Romney: ""The road to sending Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi home goes through Joe Heck and Nevada's Third Congressional District."" Democrat Dina Titus, the incumbent, is trying to make the connection toxic. In an ad called ""Two peas,"" she suggests Heck and Angle represent the same kind of extremism. (In Colorado, Sen. Michael Bennet has started using the ""two peas"" line to tie his opponent to Angle.) The Third District, where Heck and Titus are competing, is so important to the Senate race because it is the most densely populated district in Nevada. Clark County holds 920,000 of the state's 1.3 million voters. (This fact is also prominent on Heck's homepage, to drive home the idea that if voters turn out for Joe and vote the GOP line, then they'll bounce Reid.) But there's a catch: The district can't be won with Republicans alone. The most populous congressional district in the country--Nevada will likely get another seat in the House from reapportionment--it is a quintessential tossup area, filled with the kind of suburban voters and senior citizens Republicans will need to win if they're going to take back Congress. Shaped like someone squeezed a round district through their fingers, there are more Democrats than Republicans, and 16 percent of voters are registered nonpartisans. Even in a wave election, in which Republicans are more enthusiastic than Democrats and benefit from a bad economy, it is a district where the middle still matters. That's why Heck is being coy at the 7-Eleven. The voters in road crew vests buying Red Bull before work, or the casino workers buying cigarettes after a shift, are mostly Democrats. ""Hey, I know you,"" says Ken Laub, who enters the store wearing a hard hat. ""I've heard all the lies about you on TV."" (There have been tons of ads, particularly from third-party groups.) Heck has to convince people who might not like Sharron Angle to split their ticket--voting against the Republican for Senate but voting for the Republican for the House. Laub calls Angle a ""whack job,"" but he might vote for Heck. At 58, he says he's a lifelong Democrat, but Obama was the first actual Democrat he voted for in a presidential race. (There are ticket-splitters in this district. In 2008, Obama won by 13 points, but Titus won by only 6 over the incumbent Republican.) Heck appeared to make headway with others, too. Sharron McCulley, the woman worried about Angle's position on Social Security, said she was a Democrat but was considering Heck. She liked his focus on tax cuts: ""It's the only way we can lure business back here."" Katherine Davis, who boasted to the clerk at the 7-Eleven that her 14-year-old daughter had gotten a 100 percent on a geography test, said that Angle's statements about the federal Department of Education terrified her. Still, she'll consider voting for Heck. If Titus can damage Heck by tying him to Angle, it will upend the conventional wisdom that the economy is more important to voters than anything else. The economy in the Third District is terrible. The Las Vegas unemployment rate is 14.6 percent, slightly above the state figure, which is the highest in the country. Some 70 percent of the district's homeowners are upside down on their mortgages. There have been so many foreclosures in this area it makes it hard to campaign. ""You walk through a neighborhood and every third house is either a lock-box or a foreclosure sign,"" says Heck. Heck, a physician, Army Reservist, and former state senator, is a precise and disciplined campaigner. He is not trimming his views to win the middle. In a district that is 18 percent Hispanic, he opposes birthright citizenship and supports the Arizona immigration law. He says he will not accept earmarks for the district. He wants to offer a voluntary private account option for Social Security and overhaul Obama's health care legislation. His economic views are standard GOP fare--lower taxes and less regulation create opportunity for job creation. ""Please stop trying to help us,"" he says voters are telling him. ""The more you try to help us, the worse I get."" Titus, a one-term incumbent and former political science professor, has voted for all of the federal help. She supported the stimulus bill, health care reform, and cap-and-trade energy legislation. In a state that benefits from federal dollars and needs them badly, those votes aren't all a problem. She makes a strong case for the $2 billion the stimulus bill brought home to the state. But if she's going to survive, it'll be due to her attacks on Heck. So far, she's made a little headway. Heck was ahead, but now the two are statistically even. But if the truth still holds that independent voters break for the challenger in the end, then a tie isn't good enough for Titus. If this is a 7-Eleven-sized election, she won't be coming back to Washington. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter."

10	10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/rookie_mistake.html	"Each week until the election, I'm posting some of the questions I'm trying to answer based on news of the week or something that's come up in my reporting. In the following weeks, I'll try to answer some of these questions. Feel free to weigh in with answers--or with more political questions--at  slatepolitics@gmail.com  or in the comments section below. Here are this week's questions: Did Democrats make a mistake focusing on first-time Obama voters? There's still three-plus weeks till Election Day, but campaign strategists in both parties have already started to make their postmortem assessments. One theme several have hit upon is that Democrats had a bad organizing strategy. Both the Democratic National Committee and Organizing for America, the apparatus Obama created for the 2008 campaign, have focused on first-time Obama voters. (See David Plouffe's pitch.) In early summer they pledged $50 million toward a concerted effort to turn out some portion of those 15 million first-timers who voted for Obama. Critics say that money and attention would have been better spent on traditional Democratic groups--African-Americans, Latinos, and young voters--rather than the narrow group from the last election. Polls show Hispanic voters need a motivational boost, as do younger voters. Such an alternative strategy would have built on the Democratic wave from 2006 that Obama rode to victory in 2008 rather than focusing so much on the edge that he added to the Democratic coalition. I asked DNC Chairman Tim Kaine about this while he was in Nevada speaking to Latino reporters in a late effort to boost the vote, which is sagging in this crucial state (proof perhaps that these critics are right). He said the focus on new voters was a tactical necessity in a world where the Washington Democratic apparatus can only do so much. ""I can't run every campaign,"" Kaine said a couple of times. ""Our working assumption was that voting lists are so good right now, coordinated campaigns know who the every-year voters are. They don't need a lot of our help,"" he said. What the DNC can do, he said, ""is communicate with the first-timers. If we communicate persistently with first-time voters, starting in June at the door, in e-mail, through the mail, and with the president, we think we can increase the normally abysmal relationship with first-time voters. The idea was, how can we add value?"" How much will today's unemployment report matter? Today the Labor Department announced another anemic jobs report: Overall, 95,000 jobs were lost in September, and private-sector job growth was just 65,000. In one sense it was grim news for Democrats. It was another reminder that the recovery is very slow. But as a political matter, while this number related to the most important issue of this campaign, it was never likely to have any impact. (The same could be said of this piece of good news about the Dow, which closed above 11,000 today for the first time since May.) Voters who are disappointed in the economy and likely to take it out on Democrats made their determination long ago. Even if this jobs report had been great, it wouldn't have changed the fact that the vast majority of Americans just aren't feeling the recovery. Can both parties successfully play the same card? There's one thing both Democrats and Republicans can agree on: Their opponents have backed policies that have shipped jobs to China. Democratic senatorial candidates Lee Fisher in Ohio and Joe Sestak in Pennsylvania have both made this charge. Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland of Ohio is also raising the China menace in the gubernatorial race there. On the Republican side, House candidates Mark Schauer, Martin Heinrich, Robert Hurt and Spike Maynard are all running ads on that theme. For Democrats this argument appeals directly to their union supporters. When I talk to Republicans, they see the complaint as touching on a couple of core issues--feelings of nationalism and anger about the deficit (China is our largest creditor). So is this a universally powerful message, or does one party benefit more than the other? Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter."

11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/mystery_millions.html	"About four weeks ago, a 30-second political ad with a simple script and modest production values went on the air in Paul Kanjorski's northeast-Pennsylvania district. Three men appeared onscreen, trading off lines like relatives trying to tell the story of the family vacation. ""Washington liberals like Paul Kanjorski have betrayed Pennsylvania seniors,"" said the first man. ""He voted for Nancy Pelosi's big government health care plan that costs a trillion dollars,"" said the second, interrupted by the third, who informed viewers that this plan ""raises taxes and cuts $500 billion from Medicare."" ""Seniors could lose their doctors,"" said the first man, bringing it home. He closed the ad, too. ""Paul Kanjorski, you cut our Medicare. And this November, you're fired."" If you lived in Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, or Hazleton, you saw a lot of that ad. How often? Well, the 60 Plus Association bought $464,011 of airtime for it and another ad attacking Kanjorski over the economy. That's more than a third of what Kanjorki's opponent, Hazleton Mayor Lou Barletta, spent against him in 2008. Barletta is running against Kanjorski again this year. So the Kanjorski campaign has responded with guns blazing. It called 60 Plus ""a conservative front group that wants to destroy Social Security."" The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee deployed its counsel to ask local stations to remove the ad. The effect? Nothing. Not only did 60 Plus stay on the air in Wilkes-Barre, it stayed on the air in all of the states where it bought ads--Ohio, Florida, Wisconsin, New York, Indiana, Tennessee, and Arizona. The average buy for an ad taking a Democrat apart over ""Medicare cuts"" was about $400,000. The problem facing Democrats wasn't just this huge new influx of enemy cash. It was also that they had no idea where 60 Plus was getting that money from. (As a 501(c)4 organization, 60-Plus does not have to disclose its donors and only needs to detail where money has come from in annual 990 forms.) In 2006 and 2007, it spent $1.2 million and $1.9 million. Now it's dumping $6 million on ads? ""It's disturbing that anyone can start an organization called '60 Plus' or 'Americans for Jobs' or something and we don't know who's behind it,"" says Nicole Giambusso, Kanjorski's campaign spokeswoman. It's the complaint of the 2010 Democrat. Can Democrats persuade anonymously funded groups to reveal their funding? No. Can they get watchdog groups to find out where the money comes from? No. The most they can do is imply that the mysterious ads are funded by foreigners, something they've been doing since President Obama chastised the Supreme Court's decision in the Citizens United case at the State of the Union address. Still, 60 Plus plays a unique role in the Great Democratic Panic of 2010. Its funding sources are shadowy enough. When I asked both of the men who handled media for 60 Plus where the money came from, I got the same answer: ""The 60 Plus Association is funded by five and a half million citizen activists and others,"" said Tom Kise, the group's main spokesman. ""There are five and a half million supporters of 60 Plus,"" said Carl Forti, who handles the group's PR and media activity and once worked for the National Republican Congressional Committee. ""And that's where the funding comes from."" Democrats don't buy it. Some are convinced that 60 Plus's support comes from the drug industry. Pharma representatives deny that flat-out--the rumor exists because Pharma gave the group money in 2002, but it hasn't written a check since then. That only deepens the mystery, because the group's tax forms show little evidence of campaigns to tap millions of people for funds. ""This 5.5 million number is, excuse my language, a crock of shit,"" says David Donnelly, who monitors third-party groups for the liberal-leaning Public Campaign Action Fund. ""There's no way this organization has 5.5 million supporters."" So the cycle continues: Dismiss 60 Plus, realize how much money it can get access to,  attempt to discredit it, fail, and then dismiss them again. It never works, but that doesn't stop liberals from trying it. The success of 60 Plus belies its public profile or size. It operates out of a small suite of offices in downtown Alexandria, Va., across the Potomac from Washington. It has existed for 18 years but never emerged as what it claims to be--a conservative answer to AARP--because it focuses on lobbying and media appearances, not services. ""Every few years at least one group is created as the conservative or progressive alternative to AARP,"" shrugs AARP spokesman Andrew Nannis, ""depending on which high-profile issue is being debated and perhaps which party is in power. So we're used to it."" So 60 Plus usually gets ignored. Its chairman, a veteran of campaigns and direct-mail fundraising named Jim Martin, has become a sort of Tea Party Zelig. He has appeared at every big event put on by the movement--the 9/12 rallies, local rallies, Tea Party Express rallies, and conferences sponsored by the American Conservative Union and Ralph Reed's Faith & Freedom Coalition. Now and in coming days, he is part of a ""Spending Revolt"" bus tour that's hitting Democratic districts. The personal touch pays off. The people who star in 60 Plus ads come, in some cases, straight from the Tea Party. Tom Whitmore, a Virginia Tea Party activist who appeared in an ad earlier this year, helped write the script for the ad he appeared in. ""They had our contact info,"" he says, ""and asked if any of us knew any concerned seniors. I said, 'I'm one!' "" Martin--unlike, say, Grover Norquist, Karl Rove, or Dick Armey--is everywhere and yet invisible. When he speaks, people politely listen. Martin's speeches or TV appearances are games of free association, with stories about his career intermingling with anger at Washington and attacks on the AARP. These are usually accompanied by the wiry Martin, sporting a thin, white mustache reminiscent of Ted Turner's, holding up a bumper sticker that dubs the seniors' group the ""Association Against Retired People."" A Martin speech will veer from stories of employing a young George W. Bush to predicting the doom of Harry Reid (""Let me tell ya, he is toast"") to taking credit for popularizing the phrase ""death tax"" to describe the estate tax. It's brilliant. The media ignore Martin and his group. Then--surprise--the group emerges with plenty of money to attack Democrats who aren't on its side. They all assume Martin is irrelevant when he is anything but. At a July 15 tribute dinner celebrating Martin's ""50 years of political activism,"" those paying tribute included George W. Bush. ""I gave Jim a nickname: Buddha,"" Bush said in a videotaped message. ""I chose it because he enlightened me so much."" Bush's message highlights another problem for Democrats. It may well be that there's no good way to attack a group that they've said for years is irrelevant, punching above its weight, when that group suddenly becomes a reservoir for donations to beat the Democrats. But beyond that, how do you demonize a group led not by Evil Genius Karl Rove or Angry Scold Dick Armey, but by a cuddly Buddha like Jim Martin? ""He's a good solid person who's very consistent in advocacy for free market ideas,"" says Grace-Marie Turner, president of the conservative Galen Institute, and an occasional event partner of Martin. ""I've been perplexed, wondering where they get the resources to do the ads they do. I can't find the sources. But I'm glad they do them."" Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

12	12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/right_as_ever.html	"The Great Recession has done wonders for the Republican Party. Two years after being tossed out of power at every level, it's about to waltz right back in, kicking aside the corpses of Democrats foolish enough to go along with the designs of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid. This is good news for most conservatives. It's slightly worse news for a smaller group of conservatives--namely, the ones who spent the end of the '00s explaining why a Republican comeback like this was not really possible. Take, for example, Ross Douthat and Reihan Salam, whose 2005 Weekly Standard cover story, ""The Party of Sam's Club,"" looked ahead to the end of the Bush presidency as a challenge for Republicans. They advised the party to ""take the 'big-government conservatism' vision that George W. Bush and Karl Rove have hinted at but failed to develop, and give it coherence and sustainability."" Among the big ideas: wage subsidies, a mandate to purchase health insurance, and ""pro-family"" tax reforms that would raise rates for some people. In 2008 the authors expanded this argument into a book,  Grand New Party, and the intervening years didn't put much rust on the thesis. ""Some combination of the populist Left and the neoliberal center is likely to emerge as America's next political majority,"" they mused. They had data to back up their trends. But it now appears that the GOP is about to win without tapping into any of that stuff. The conservative movement's smart set, the people who liberals considered serious critics who could remake the right, really had nothing to do with the Republican Party's great comeback. So I checked in with Douthat, Salam, and David Frum, all conservatives who opened the Obama era with prescriptions for conservative comebacks that played no role in the current conservative comeback. They stood by almost all of their analyses. And they greeted the coming Republican rout as an opportunity that might be wasted, because the party hadn't done enough deep thinking and wearing of hairshirts. ""When you have an incumbent president who has launched a bold plan to save the economy,"" says David Frum, author of  Comeback: Conservatism That Can Win Again, ""and it hasn't worked and the economy is worse than ever, the opposition doesn't need any plan at all. There's probably not going to be reform right after the GOP wins. Organizations that are highly successful don't make changes rapidly."" This is not how Frum expected things to go. As the GOP was hitting the reef, he published Comeback. He launched a new Web site, New Majority, the day that Obama was inaugurated. (The site was subsequently renamed FrumForum.) In March 2009, he made a splash with a cover story for Newsweek warning of the damage Rush Limbaugh was doing to the GOP's comeback hopes. ""The worse conservatives do,"" wrote Frum, ""the more important Rush becomes as leader of the ardent remnant. The better conservatives succeed, the more we become a broad national governing coalition, the more Rush will be sidelined."" In reality, conservatives succeeded and Rush grew, impossibly, even more prominent and influential. ""In the fall of 2010, nobody needs Comeback and nobody needs Grand New Party,"" says Frum. Rush and his listeners couldn't have planned it better. They argued then, and argue now, that people like Frum, Salam, Douthat, Sam Tanenhaus, and others care more about the fabled ""Georgetown cocktail circuit"" than they care about conservative principles. And they may have a point that a conservative apostate gets more media attention, and more Diet Coke in the green rooms, than a standard-issue true believer. But that's not why the Frums of the world wrung their hands and wrote their manifestos. Yes, they were written with the assumption that the GOP was going to serve more time in detention--and that detention was actually necessary. If the GOP came roaring back by going further to the right, their theory went, that would prove that they didn't understand why they governed so poorly in the first place. They would think that all they needed to do was bang on about tax cuts and the Constitution, and that would not only win the election but make them govern more intelligently. Of course, to the horror of the smart set, this is exactly what is happening. The conservative base looked at any attempt to answer the Democrats on policy as a cave-in to socialism. When they're making the case for their research, Douthat and Salam acknowledge that reality. But they argue that Republicans have been using their key insights anyway and that the hot rhetoric of the GOP obscures what actually happened. ""I think the way a lot of Republicans are campaigning now--as resolute foes of big government who are also going to save Medicare from the Democrats--suggests that they understand the point of Grand New Party pretty well,"" says Douthat. They're just taking our insight, that even many conservative voters like the welfare state, and running with it in a cynical rather than a constructive direction."" Salam agrees. ""The base of the Republican Party is what we thought it was,"" he says, ""namely whites with economic anxieties. That explains the backlash to Social Security reform and immigration reform under Bush. And the Democrats gave us another opening, because they funded health care reform with Medicare cuts. That's a big validation of Grand New Party's argument."" It's an ingenious argument: We're not wrong. We're just not yet right. After the election, says Frum, after the GOP has recovered in record time, either it's going to have to move away from its campaign rhetoric or it's going to be unable to govern. ""What happens in January,"" Frum says, ""when the GOP majority arrives and the Bush tax cuts expire, the U.S. economy has deflationary shock, we don't have a program for pulling the economy out of inflation, and we don't have permission from party supporters or permission from voters to compromise? You have people arriving in office with highly apocalyptic vision of a president but programs they don't know how to execute on their own. It's a formula for crisis."" And crises, of course, often require just the kind of smart thinking that only the smart set can provide. Wherever there's a Tea Party candidate who won by promising to roll back the Progressive Era, there will be the conservative critics they ignored, ready to bail them out. ""The Republicans didn't turn around their own fortunes at all,"" says Mickey Edwards, a former congressman, now Aspen Institute fellow, who did the lecture circuit for his book  Reclaiming Conservatism. ""They were bystanders. When I read their new 'Contract from America,' or whatever they're calling it, there's nothing really new there, other than we didn't do a good job last time and need to do better. I don't know what that means."" He pauses. ""But the first Contract With America was a really dumb thing in the first place."" Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

14	14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/blowing_up_stuff.html	"It's hard to count the explosions. Battle for America has the sort of pyrotechnics that would make Michael Bay worry about the viewers' retinas. Some buildings implode as fireballs tumble out the windows. Others crumble into clouds of dust and rubble. A group of dinosaurs, minding their own business, scrambles away from a meteor that causes a mushroom cloud, bringing them all to extinction. All of this is in the service of a very sober argument about the failures of the 111th Congress. Battle for America is the fifth film produced in 2010 by Citizens United and the third by a former mergers-and-acquisitions manager named Stephen K. Bannon. Not too long ago, he was an amateur director. Now, he's playing his movies at Tea Party events, conventions, and special screenings like the one in Georgetown Thursday night. Citizens United President David Bossie was there, as was the movie's host, Dick Morris, and Rep. Dan Lungren, R-Calif. Bannon, wearing a West Point windbreaker (his daughter attended the school), was giddy about what his movies can do to the Democrats. ""We've tried to weaponize film,"" he said. ""And we've tried to do in it a certain way to get this view to people who might not necessarily see a political documentary. We made this film for independents and for Reagan Democrats. We're actually going to take it to Paul Kanjorski's district,"" he said, referring to the Pennsylvania Democrat who's on the first line of the incumbent deathwatch. ""His constituents, those are the kind of people who need to see this."" Outside the theater, one of the Washington panics of the moment concerns the surge of campaign spending brought on by Citizens United. It was Bossie's group and its advertisements for  Hillary: The Movie, that initiated a lawsuit that reached the Supreme Court. ""We won,"" Bossie told the premiere audience. ""And we want to make use of that."" Battle for America is one of the products of that big win. It's the group's final film of the year and the one with the least promotion, especially compared to last month's Newt Gingrich spectacular America at Risk. Bannon's Fire From the Heartland had the irresistible hook of being all about conservative women; this weekend, it is being screened at the Smart Girl Politics blogger conference at a Hyatt across the Potomac. Bannon's first film, Generation Zero, premiered at the National Tea Party Convention in Nashville, Tenn. This movie, though, doesn't have the historical weight or niche appeal of other Citizens United productions. It's what the group went to court for: a campaign pick-me-up meant to rally and win voters. It is a tie-in, effectively, to the campaign tour that Morris is doing for Republican candidates. It's going to be advertised on TV. It's going to play wherever there's a waiting screen. ""That's what we won the right to do,"" Bossie said. ""The genius of Bossie and Citizens United,"" said Morris, ""is that instead of producing 30-second and 60-second ads, they're producing 90-minute films, I think the Supreme Court calls them. We overemphasize reach and frequency. In the modern era, what you really need is depth to get to people."" So, then: the depth. Bannon denies being influenced too much by Michael Moore, but Battle for America is so similar to Moore's work that it's impossible not to make the connection. Most of the images--400 or so of them, bragged Bannon--are stock footage chosen for impact and, occasionally, silliness. For example: A monologue from Lungren about how President Obama was born in America but lacks some appreciation for his country is played over images of Obama making weak opening throws at baseball games.Assertions about the ""myth"" that the 2009 stimulus bill created jobs are illustrated by a man in a Sasquatch suit making his lazy way through a forest.Multiple commenters say Obama is enslaving America economically; to prove it, we see video of African slaves hauling giant blocks to build pyramids.Grumbles about an ""imperial Congress"" from Lou Dobbs--who, in his monologue, alternately accuses Democrats of hating capitalism and of being beholden to corporations--are illustrated by clips of men in Roman centurion costumes. All of this is told by Ann Coulter, Newt Gingrich, AEI President Arthur Brooks, and other pundits backing up Morris. And then there are the many, many explosions. According to Bannon, they ""move the story to the crescendo."" They're aided by a soundtrack that's unremittingly grim and sounds almost exactly like Philip Glass' soundtrack to Koyaanisqatsi *, all droning organs and tragic horns. There's something here, though, that doesn't remind us of Michael Moore. It's familiarity. As proud as the Citizens United team is of its films, edited out of a brownstone east of the Capitol, they are not making arguments as bold as the ones Moore made or using footage as rare as he used. The enduring video of Moore's  Fahrenheit 9/11, for example, is of George W. Bush on the golf course talking about terrorismand then saying, ""Watch this drive."" That was a clip few had noticed until then. The Citizens United films are outgrowths of Fox News and conservative activists with YouTube accounts. Battle for America's clips of Obama and the Democrats are ones conservatives have seen many, many times--Obama ""bowing"" to Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi telling a union crowd that Democrats had to pass health care ""so you know what's in it,"" Rep. Bob Etheridge being a jerk to an anonymous kid with a camera. This is what Democrats fail to understand about the Tea and Republican parties massed against them. ""Our actors kind of act like a Greek chorus, knitting all of this together,"" said Bannon. This is an artistic way of looking at things. The Citizens United films don't just ""weaponize"" politics. They verify and build on the accepted history that, if you're a conservative, you consume every day. Do Tea Partiers really need this to get revved up? Bannon may be done making movies for now. But Bossie isn't done promoting them. The next month will be spent on publicity and, at some point, working on what Morris tentatively calls Project 100, which will buy ads against Democrats that pollsters have not yet listed as vulnerable. After the movie is over, at a small reception, Bossie reported that the campaign is already under way. ""There should be an ad for America at Risk on MSNBC right about""--he checks his watch--""right about now.""

Some people get lucky. Others win with skill. Yet others prevail by sheer force of will. I'm talking, of course, about political prognosticators. With the midterm election less than two weeks away, everyone is picking a number--the number of seats in the House and Senate they think Republicans will pick up. (The GOP needs to pick up 39 seats in the House to form a majority, and 10 in the Senate.) The boldest declaration so far has come from Dick Morris, who predicted that Republicans will pick up more than 74 seats, the current historic record, and said that number ""could go as high as 100."" Bill Kristol and Mark Halperin both said in August that if current trends continued, Republicans could gain about 60 seats. (Halperin was careful to say that his statement was not a ""prediction."") At the low end of the spectrum, one group of political scientists has predicted Republican pickup as low as 22 House seats. The two most influential Washington prognosticators, the Cook Political Report and the Rothenberg Political Report, put the Republican surge somewhere between 40 and 50 seats, while University of Virginia professor and longtime handicapper Larry Sabato bets the GOP picks up 47 seats in the House, and 8 or 9 in the Senate. Not everyone can be right. In fact, there's a decent chance that some people will end up eating their hats. If past elections are any indicator, there are plenty of ways political predictions can go awry. The earliest predictive disasters occurred because of bad polling. In 1936, the Literary Digest, which had correctly predicted the outcome of the five previous elections, gave its nod to Republican presidential candidate Alfred Landon. According to its poll of two million voters, Landon would beat Franklin D. Roosevelt with 57 percent of the vote. He did not. The problem was the survey's sample, which consisted of relatively well-to-do Digest readers--i.e. Republican voters. Hubris led to another historically disastrous prediction. George Gallup and other pollsters were so sure that Thomas Dewey would defeat Harry Truman in 1948, they stopped polling weeks before the election. The consequences were infamous. Another flaw is giving anecdotal evidence more weight than it deserves. ""The press traveling with McGovern in 1972 was absolutely convinced that a massive upset was gonna happen because he was drawing huge crowds,"" says Sabato. McGovern ended up losing every state but Massachusetts. David Broder's declaration in 1983 that ""[w]hat we are witnessing this January is not the midpoint of the Reagan presidency, but its phase-out""--an ill-fated prophecy--owed partly to the Republicans' recent defeat in the midterms, partly to the president's sagging poll numbers, and partly to Broder's vague perception that ""power is moving away from Reagan in the ongoing work of government."" Even the best prognosticators run into problems when calling local races, due to the dearth of surveys. In 2006, Carol Shea-Porter wasn't seen as competitive in her campaign to win a seat in the U.S. House from New Hampshire. Pollsters and handicappers forgot about her as a result--until she won in November. Same with Dave Loebsack's race against 15-term House incumbent Jim Leach in Iowa in 2006. ""We weren't carrying them on our competitive races list,"" says Nathan Gonzales of the Rothenberg Political Report. Then there was the collective misfire in the days before Hillary Clinton won the New Hampshire primary in 2008. ""I think we all got that one wrong,"" says Jennifer Duffy of the Cook Political Report. ""I remember doing an interview I hope to God didn't air. I predicted Obama's victory because that's what the data I had said."" The explanation: Turnout among women was a lot higher than expected. Prognosticators control for error by looking at more than just public polls. They also analyze turnout models, conduct interviews with candidates, and communicate with campaigns about their internal polls. There's a chance subjective information could lead predictors astray. But it's a chance they're willing to take. ""I'd rather have more info than less information,"" says Gonzales. Sometimes, forecasters just go with their gut. In 2006, Rothenberg moved the Virginia Senate race from ""toss-up"" to ""lean Democratic."" ""I had no numbers to justify that, I just kind of took a flyer,"" he says. He knew it was a big year for Democrats and ""all the close ones tend to fall one way."" In 2008, Rothenberg again predicted toss-ups would break disproportionately for Democrats. But this time they broke evenly. The other trick for avoiding error is, when in doubt, to declare a race a toss-up. ""We can take one of two paths,"" says Gonzales. ""Any time we hear about an incumbent that might be vulnerable, we can put them on our list [of competitive races] to avoid that surprise. But we don't want to put everything on just to cover our rear end."" As a compromise, the Rothenberg report created a new category half-way between ""toss-up"" and ""lean"" called the ""toss-up/tilt."" ""We'd always like to put a pinky on scale,"" says Stuart Rothenberg. From Sabato's perspective, that's the easy way out. He calls every race. ""That's the fun of it,"" he says. ""Why not take a guess? Who cares if you're wrong? It doesn't make any difference."" The beauty of punditry is there are no consequences. ""For our subscribers and our readers that understand what we do, there isn't a long term backlash,"" says Rothenberg. Some people will accuse them of carrying water for one party or another. But that's probably because the party is doing well. ""Four years ago, we were attacked as liberals because everything we said looked like good news for Democrats,"" says Gonzales. ""Now we're being attacked as conservatives because it's good news for Republicans."" In both cases--with the disclaimer, if current trends continue--they were right. Like Slate on  Facebook.

17	17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/man_down.html	"Man, the use of ""Man up"" has gone up. Sharron Angle, a Republican, said Harry Reid should ""man up"" and accept the fact that there's a Social Security crisis. Robin Carnahan, a Democrat, used the phrase against Roy Blunt during a debate about health care. Former House Majority Leader turned activist Dick Armey has used it, as has Florida Democratic candidate Kendrick Meek. At a Tea Party Express rally Monday, Sarah Palin said, ""Hey, politicians who are in office today, you, some of you, need to man up and spend some political capital to support the Tea Party."" Anyone who has listened to any debates this year knows that political discussion has become ever more like the airport sandwich: shrink-wrapped, soggy, and without flavor. (The exception is the New York governor's race, which resembles the airport bar) The journey of ""man up"" from clever rejoinder to cliche is an illustration of why our political communication is so shabby. During the 2009 New Jersey gubernatorial campaign, Democrat John Corzine made not-so-subtle fun of his opponent Chris Christie's weight. In an ad, Corzine accused Christie of ""[throwing] his weight around"" and showed the Republican getting out of an SUV in slow motion to accentuate his size. Asked about the ad, Christie, who went on to become the governor of New Jersey, said that Corzine should just ""man up and say I'm fat."" The remark made news because it was amusing. It was repeated because it was rare: a politician cutting to the truth. It was also authentic. Christie was secure, unlike most politicians who are afraid to make a stir. To use another macho verb that was once in vogue, Christie ""owned"" his fatness--just as Cyrano de Bergerac owned his nose--and turned it from a taunt into a weapon. This is what we are starved for. Imagine if someone spoke plainly about something that mattered! Original, unvarnished speech is such a danger, however, that politicians of both parties have joined together to make the expression ""man up"" into a cliche, rendering it as harmless as the promise to ""put America first."" When a politician uses the expression now, it is rehearsed as dinner theater. It is dreary to watch, boring to listen to, and tells us nothing about the politician or the issue he or she is talking about. The final step in the life of a modern political cliche is to become totally detached from its original meaning. Sarah Palin assists in this cause. The former governor of Alaska has minted a powerful political expression of this cycle: ""How is that hope-y change-y thing working out for you?"" This enthralls her supporters and enrages her opponents, while getting at the undeniable, underlying truth that President Obama did not meet a lot of people's expectations. But when she uses the phrase ""man up,"" she courts trouble. Her final act as an elected official was to quit her office before her term was over. Does she really have standing to tell people to suck it up when the going gets tough? Palin is fond of basketball metaphors. In basketball, ""man up"" can mean continuing to play even though people are being unfair to you. Fortunately for Palin and others who will continue to abuse this cliche, logic is not a requirement for political speech. ""Man up,"" the phrase of the political fall, has now become one more sign of it. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter."

18	18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/buckeye_buckup.html	"COLUMBUS, Ohio--Two days before Election Day in 2008, Michelle Obama bragged about her husband to a crowd here of 60,000. ""Barack has built one of the most powerful political organizations, recruiting millions of folks from all different kind of backgrounds. ... He has built one of the most powerful political fundraising machines. ... Barack has helped to unify a party that some said could not be unified."" He was ""more than ready to be the next president of the United States."" Now that he is president, is the machine ready? That was the question Sunday night as Michelle Obama returned to Columbus with her husband for their first campaign rally since they were here two years ago. The machine sure looked ready. Some 35,000 people stood at the center of Ohio State University in the cool clear night. ""O-H,"" said the first lady when she stepped up to the microphone. ""I-O,"" responded the crowd like it was at a sporting event. ""That's very cool,"" she said, impressed with her ability to get the crowd to react so quickly and loudly. If only Democratic voters would respond so faithfully. The party will need this kind of organizational triumph on Election Day to rescue the two key races in the state, neither of which is looking good. Incumbent Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland is behind Republican John Kasich by an average of six points in the polls. In the race for the U.S. Senate, Democratic Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher trails former Rep. Rob Portman by an average of 18 points. The evening wasn't just about Ohio, though. Democrats hope that a show of force here will inspire their voters all over the country to go to the polls in an election where conservatives are highly motivated. The crowd was blasted with light. The event was made for broadcast. A boom camera streamed the event live to the Internet. Michelle Obama was there to build up her husband, not attack his opponents. By adding her to the event, organizers hoped to rekindle the spirit of two years ago, particularly among first-time college voters. ""So tell me something, Ohio. If you are still as fired up and ready to go as you were two years ago, then I know that we can keep bringing about the change that I know, that we all know, we can keep that American Dream alive,"" she said. Meanwhile in California, Sarah Palin used the first lady's return to the campaign trail to revive another part of the 2008 campaign. In a rally in San Jose on Thursday, Palin said, ""You know, when I hear people say, or had said during the campaign that they've never been proud of America, haven't they met anybody in uniform yet?"" As first lady, Michelle Obama has tried to be an advocate for military families. But Palin was referring to Michelle Obama's statement in 2008 that for the first time she was ""proud"" of her country. (Later Mrs. Obama clarified her remarks to say what she was proud of was the level of political engagement, which was like never before.) The White House has jumped at chances to attack conservatives from Rush Limbaugh to Minority Leader John Boehner. Michelle Obama is far more popular than Palin. Her approval rating was 65 percent in a recent CNN poll. Palin's is half that, with a 30 percent approval rating in a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal  poll; 48 percent disapprove. But a White House official says it will not respond to Palin. (The first lady has avoided talking about Palin before.) Michelle Obama's approval ratings are good, in part, because she avoids these kinds of fights. In Columbus, the crowd was enthusiastic, but not at the level of 2008, when the roars at some Obama speeches made you wonder if a touchdown had been scored somewhere. The drop-off is to be expected--it's not a presidential-election year, and reality has intruded on the vague dreams of the last election. As President Obama admitted, ""Let's be honest. This is a difficult election."" Obama wasn't just referring to the difficult economy. He knows that his supporters are disappointed with his performance. A recent AP poll shows that only 36 percent of Obama backers who expected change in Washington now think it can happen.  At the rally and later reception for Strickland, the president addressed that disappointment directly: ""I understand that some of you when you think back--you know, election night looked so good. Inauguration day, Beyonce was singing. Bono was up there. And everybody had a good feeling. And then, you know what happens is, we start trying to solve these problems, and it doesn't happen as quick as we want. Suddenly the other side is obstructing, and people start looking around and seeing a family member of mine is still losing a job or another foreclosure sign has gone up in my neighborhood. And you're seeing all these TV ads and politicians are tearing each other down. And pundits are saying you can't really change politics. I know--I know it gets discouraging sometimes.  But don't let anybody tell you this fight isn't worth it.  Don't let them tell you you're not making a difference."" His voice hoarse, the president focused on the danger of giving Republicans control of Congress, as he has for the last several months. He said Republicans would reverse major achievements like health care reform and new financial regulations, putting special interests back in control. ""The empire is striking back,"" Obama said about the GOP and their corporate backers. ""To win this election, they are plowing tens of millions of dollars into front groups. They are running misleading negative ads all across the country."" After 15 minutes of laying out the horrors of GOP control, the president said, without apparent irony, ""The other side is playing on fear. That's what they do."" The president's pitch ended on a note of inspiration. Change takes time and patience and perseverance, he said: ""Nothing in America has ever been easy. The very founding of this country was hard."" He then wrapped the audience in the blanket of American history: The challenge of the moment calls for the same spirit that pulled Americans through the Civil War, slavery, World War II, the fight for workers' rights, and the civil rights movement. The rallying pitch approached the rhetorical power that was commonplace during 2008, when Obama called on voters to make history by electing him. This election, making history will be harder.

19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/the_notsogreat_debates.html	"No one wins in political debates--least of all the audience. We know it's a bad idea to watch them. But we watch anyway, thinking: This could be it. This debate, unlike the others, could begin with an exchange of bon mots, transition to witty jousting, probe deeply into most pressing issues of our time, build with a set of passionate but non-cliched paeans to the American idea, and climax with a final parry-thrust that leaves a verbal dagger lodged in the lesser candidate's larynx. That never happens. Viewers are instead subjected to a fire hose of context-free assertions and vague cant. Arguments are oversimplified. Rhetorical pivots are uncreative. Personal attacks are never as vicious as you hope. Even a great train wreck is too much to ask. It was with some masochism, then, that I reached for my toothpicks, propped open my eyelids, and watched as many debates this week as my brain would permit: Eight in four days, including those between House, Senate, or gubernatorial candidates in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Nevada, and Wisconsin. The events, while insufferable, did reveal the fault lines of this year's midterm elections. Regular American vs. Lifelong PoliticianIf there's one thing that counts against candidates this year, it's knowing what they're doing. ""I had no political aspirations,"" Ron Johnson, the Republican candidate running against Sen. Russ Feingold in Wisconsin, reminded the crowd at a debate Monday. ""This is not my life's ambition."" Meg Whitman, the Republican candidate for governor of California, similarly compared herself with Democrat Jerry Brown: ""I'm not a career politician."" ""Do we want to send this gentleman to Washington?"" Delaware senatorial candidate Christine O'Donnell asked an audience on Wednesday about her opponent, Chris Coons. ""I say no. He's a career politician."" It's no coincidence that many of the candidates making the ""career politician"" claim come from the business world. The difference between politicians and businessmen? ""He's never created a job,"" said Johnson of Feingold. ""My job was creating jobs, your job was politics,"" said Whitman, who was chief executive of eBay, to Brown. ""Have you created any jobs in our country?"" asked former WWE CEO Linda McMahon of her Democratic opponent in the Connecticut Senate race, state Attorney General Richard Blumenthal. Never mind that the job they're running for wouldn't create jobs, according to their logic. Business people have another advantage this cycle: They finance their own campaigns. Whitman bragged about how she's spent her own money--unlike Brown, who she says relies on contributions from special interests. McMahon made the same accusation of Blumenthal. Blumenthal responded like, well, a lifelong politician. ""The people of Connecticut know me."" The crowd laughed. Insider vs. OutsiderEveryone in this cycle wants to portray himself as the outsider, the lone wolf, the guy everyone in Washington hates so much, he'll need a personal bodyguard. Longtime politicians struggle hardest to establish their outsider bona fides. ""This is not about civility or go along to get along,"" said Indiana Republican Senate candidate Dan Coats, whose civility got him elected to the Senate once before. ""We don't go there and sing 'Kumbaya' across the aisle."" Michael Bennet, the former Denver schools superintendent who's now a politician in Washington, denounced ""politicians in Washington."" Feingold, who recently bragged in an ad about what a social outcast he is, declared himself the ""No. 1 enemy of Washington lobbyists"" at Monday's debate. His opponent, Johnson, did him one better: He's such an outsider that he would defer to President Obama on policy in Afghanistan. ""I haven't seen the intelligence reports,"" said Johnson. "" I want to give him the benefit of the doubt."" You don't get further outside than that. National vs. Local Halfway through the Monday debate between Kentucky senatorial candidates Rand Paul and Jack Conway, Paul had mentioned Obama's name so many times that Conway called him out: ""This election isn't about President Obama,"" he said. ""It's about Jack Conway vs. Rand Paul.""*  Just as Democrats tied Republicans to Bush in 2006, the GOP is now tying Dems to Obama. Coats kept mentioning his opponent in the same breath as the ""Obama-Pelosi agenda."" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, facing off against Sharron Angle on Thursday, tried to emphasize his hardscrabble Nevada upbringing and bragged about keeping nuclear waste away from Yucca Mountain. But Angle (and the debate's moderators) kept the discussion national, even managing to ding Nancy Pelosi for her remark about needing to pass the health care bill to find out what's in it. Exciting Weirdo Trying to Seem Boring vs. Boring Normal Person Trying to Seem ExcitingWhen confronted with a crazy opponent, politicians face a dilemma: Do they condescend to the person to show their superiority or show respect that might not be deserved? Coons, sitting across from O'Donnell, made his disdain clear. ""I'm not going to stop every single time she says something untrue,"" he said at one point. When he did decide to rebut a comment, he wasted time mourning how much more time he would need: ""There's so much to respond to, Wolf [Blitzer], I don't know if it's enough."" Reid took the opposite approach, engaging Angle as if she were the sanest person in the world. Conway called Paul's ideas ""extreme"" but stopped short of calling him a nutjob. (After all, that nutjob is leading in the polls.) Paul came off as beyond normal. He stressed early on that he doesn't want to abolish government. Government is great, he said, for essential services like national security, Medicare, and roads. ""When people say, 'Gosh, could that be extreme?' I say, well, what's extreme is what's going on in Washington."" Angle, too, denied wanting to destroy the federal education department--before describing everything that's wrong with the federal education department. Ohio Republican House candidate Rich Iott, who has recently been dogged by photos of him wearing a Nazi uniform, addressed the controversy right out of the gate, accusing his opponent of ""coordinating"" the leak. That did not change the fact that there are photos of him wearing a Nazi uniform. Some candidates embraced the fringe. Responding to a question about Ayn Rand, Johnson declared that "" Atlas Shrugged is a huge warning as far as what we need to avoid."" In past years, that line would get a candidate laughed out of the race. This year, it just might get him elected.

20	20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/low_roller.html	"After watching the Nevada Senate debate, the country should hope that what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Whatever talents Harry Reid and Sharron Angle may have, they were not on display in the hourlong event. The problem was not nastiness. By modern standards, and the vitriol of this campaign, the candidates were pretty tame. The problem was that both candidates at times seemed only lightly connected to the questions and content of the evening. They ignored questions, which is frustrating enough, but then they filled the space with talking points delivered in staccato fashion so that at times it seemed like entire sentences were missing. Sharron Angle had the marginally better night in the only debate of this high-profile race. Reid has portrayed her as a nut case. She didn't appear nutty. Sure, she ducked questions on Social Security and job creation, contradicted herself and conveyed no particular magnetism, but Reid ducked, waffled and wandered, too. If Angle won, though, the prize for the night might be tiny. The most recent poll in the state shows that the race is dead even. Four percent of the voters are undecided. If Nevada's undecided voters are like those in other states, the debate isn't going to sway them--particularly a debate where the ""winner"" didn't really win in a dramatic fashion. Those voters are going to form their impressions in some other way. Voters were certainly given a clear choice. Reid talked about all that he and the president had done to help the state with the highest unemployment rate in the country. Angle criticized that federal intervention. A senator's task was not to create jobs by funding projects, she said, but to create a private sector environment so that business can thrive. But those differences in approach have been clear for months. Was there anything that will live on after the debate that might help the undecided voter pick a candidate? Reid certainly didn't provide anything. He talked about the money and jobs he's brought home for the state. He's been doing that for months, in person and on the airwaves. It hasn't changed the dynamic. He was every inch a senator. He dispensed jargon--CBO, exchanges--and the names of legislation like ""wounded warrior"" and the Hyde amendment just as he would on the Senate floor. The latter was in response to a yes or no question about abortion, which meant his response hit for the cycle-- evasive, long-winded and jargon-filled. His answer to a question about the Bush tax cuts was that he'd consult experts. He even lapsed into calling Angle ""my friend,"" as if she were already in the adjacent cloakroom. The candidates didn't have talking points. They had talking dashes--snippets of phrases and buzzwords. Reid used the word ""extreme"" often when talking about Angle. Her safe word was ""Obamacare."" If Reid's words dribbled out, Angle's came like karate chops. When she wasn't offering urgent platitudes about the Constitution and limited government, she was on the attack. She portrayed Reid as a serial tax-raiser and career politician. She also got personal, hitting him for living in the Ritz-Carlton and suggesting he had enriched himself as a senator. She also challenged his masculinity. ""Man up, Harry Reid. You need to understand that we have a problem with Social Security,"" she said. The Big Line was so thoroughly inauthentic, she should apologize to her fellow Republican, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who so effectively used that line in his race last year. If there was one little flake of gold for Reid in the evening, it may have been in Angle's response to questions about whether government should mandate that insurance companies cover services like mammograms or colonoscopies. Angle said there should be no mandates. ""What we have here is a choice between the free markets and Americanism,"" she said. Reid kept trying to paint her as extreme on issues like Social Security or dismantling government, but she ducked or muddled the issue. In this instance, though, she was actually embracing an extreme view. Insurance companies are not popular. President Obama's health care legislation may not be popular, either, but individual government intervention to ensure coverage is. For examples, in a recent Bloomberg poll, 75 percent of respondents said they supported a ban on insurance companies denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions. You can imagine how a politician like Bill Clinton might have responded to this in the moment, naming specific cases where people were denied lifesaving preventative tests. Reid gave no such answer. He talked about football and baseball players wearing pink for breast cancer awareness. He then talked about how in colonoscopies they ""snip off the things they find."" Nevertheless, in the coming days Reid and his surrogates will no doubt run hard on this issue. You can bet it'll be in an ad. It will provide a potentially fresh way for him to talk about Angle's extremism. The problem for Reid is that he's been playing the extremism note for months. Anyone already predisposed to thinking Angle's views go too far has probably already drawn that conclusion. For the last several weeks, the contest between Angle and Reid has been stagnant. The polls have been tied. The candidates have been playing to the same scripts. Despite the tons of ads on television, visits from big names like Bill Clinton, and outrage over gaffes, it has felt arid and unmoving. In the casinos in Nevada when this happens, they pump in oxygen. This debate did not do that for this race. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

21	21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/can_the_mama_grizzlies_pull_off_a_twitter_revolution.html	"""But how do the hash tags work, exactly?"" ""How can I link my blog to my Facebook page?"" The questions were directed at me and came from a retired female cop from upstate New York. Our dining companions, seventysomethings from North Carolina, asked for my professional media expertise. They hadn't yet joined Twitter but planned to after all they'd heard about it at the Smart Girl Summit, a recent conference of conservative--mostly Tea Party--women. They listened eagerly to my answers, then even more eagerly as featured speaker Michele Bachmann told the group that 61 percent of independent voters distrust the ""lamestream"" media, that the media are even angrier than the Tea Party. The ex-cop blogger clapped loudly and politely passed the rolls my way. The Smart Girl Summit, attended by about 250 (largely women, with a smattering of husbands and male speakers), grew out of a blog started by a stay-at-home mother. One of the featured speakers, Dana Loesch, a rising conservative pundit and home-schooling mother, initially grabbed attention for her blog, Mamalogues, which she still maintains in addition to her TV and radio work. Another, Rachel Campos-Duffy, a Real World alum, has maintained her media presence through a combination of mommy-blogging and TV punditry. One attendee, a hairdresser turned full-time mother, grabbed national attention during the 2008 election for her blog, Moms4SarahPalin. * The new wave of Mama Grizzlies believes--and they have some evidence to prove it--that social media is the key to their success. In nearly every session I sat in on, the speaker drove home the point that the easiest way to work for the Tea Party was to be active on Twitter and Facebook--this was the sort of political organizing that a busy mom could do, without even leaving the house. And by many measures, women already dominate social media: They outnumber men nearly 60 percent to 40 percent on Facebook and Twitter, and married women between 35 and 50 are the fastest-growing group of social-networkers. Their usage also tends to be more relationship- and communication-driven, less ""transactional."" ""Nontraditional media will give you the courage to tell your story,"" one speaker said, echoing a blogger who told me she thinks women are more bold behind the safety of our computer screens. None of them mentions a recent New Yorker article on Twitter activism by Malcolm Gladwell, which would dampen their cause. Gladwell is thoroughly skeptical of its effectiveness, comparing Twitter activism in Iran and Moldova unfavorably with the activism of the 1960s American civil rights movement. The key distinction, according to Gladwell, is that ""Social networks are effective at increasing participation--by lessening the level of motivation that participation requires"" rather than effecting actual change. And true, that's exactly what the online Grizzlies emphasize, how easy it is to be part of the movement online. Gladwell concedes that ""[t]he drawbacks of networks scarcely matter if the network isn't interested in systemic change--if it just wants to frighten or humiliate or make a splash."" But is that true of the Tea Party moms? Yes, their poll numbers are relatively unpromising for the November general election. But they seem to still want to turn their online power into noise on the streets. The group that sponsored the conference also sponsored the first Tea Party rally last year, and the point of the summit was to take ""weak-tie"" online bonds and turn them into real-life connections (which, Gladwell says, drive effective activism). To get people to move from just being part of an inchoate network and to think about becoming leaders within a movement. To have women meet the people they'd been retweeting on Twitter, so that maybe they'd volunteer for the other's candidate of choice, or even her campaign. To spawn more organizations, more networks within a network. According to Loesch, ""Activism is just as much building relationships as getting out there."" The conference itself, by the way, got most of its publicity through its social media presence--that's where almost everyone I talked to said they'd heard about it and where I was tipped off to it, too. And the organizers told me they were able to attract such high-profile speakers--Bachmann, Liz Cheney, Anita Moncrief--because of a larger-than-life, influential Twitter presence. And when they all get together in person, as Hanna Rosin wrote in Slate earlier this year, ""the movement feels like a real tea party."" It's social, it's fun for these women; it flies in the face of the bowling-alone trend. Of course, before the Tea Party, there was Obama's '08 campaign, famous for its online grass-roots activism, which candidates on both sides have imitated to mixed results. It's still unclear what works, though the Tea Party has especially embraced the home phone-bank along with social media, instead of flashy but less effective--and far more expensive--iPhone apps and the like. This particular conference included seminars on how to obtain old voting data for your precinct, how to crunch the numbers and decide when a precinct was winnable, what to say when talking to undecideds, what sort of voter fraud to be on the lookout for, even how to lay the groundwork for your own campaign. (Another Twitter-activism critique from Gladwell: ""It shifts our energies from organizations that promote strategic and disciplined activity and toward those which promote resilience and adaptability. It makes it easier for activists to express themselves, and harder for that expression to have any impact."") There have been plenty of conservative women's organizations before, of course--think the Eagle Forum--but over and over, panelists emphasized that those groups hadn't adapted and that these new tactics were reaching a new audience, a new generation, the ""new media."" Look no further than Sarah Palin's tweeting for evidence of how large and loud that bullhorn can be: She is followed by fewer than 300,000 users, a relatively modest number given her celebrity, yet her remarks often propel a whole news cycle. This brand of social activism also happens to perfectly dovetail with the brand of conservative feminism that was being promoted at the conference: You can maintain your duties as a wife and mother but also become involved in the movement through making phone calls, handing out flyers, running for school board if national office seems too disruptive to your family. (""Start small, build big"" was another theme--school board leads to county leads to state, etc.) You can organize an entire conference and run a highly trafficked Web site but, since those activities are not professionalized, still call yourself a stay-at-home mom. And those ""maternal"" skills--organization, communication--are just as good, if not better than, a high-powered professional resume in a movement that's asking for foot soldiers. (But high-powered resumes are OK, too--cf Liz Cheney.) Women who stayed at home with their kids might not be able to then land a gig at, say, the National Review if they'd wanted one, but in this movement, the blogs they might start and the tweeting they can do are valued more than ""lamestream"" coverage. Or at least that's the message. Whether the message--tweeted, facebooked, direct-mailed, blogged--can actually turn into reality remains to be seen.

22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/a_stimulus_for_the_gop.html	"Is President Obama's problem competence or communication? Don't answer that: The answer is neither--it's the economy. But voters talk about their problems with the administration by bringing up (in)competence and (mis)communication. Why hasn't Obama done more to fix the economy? Or why hasn't he done a better job explaining what he has done? The president and Vice President Joe Biden both made the case for communication recently. In a town hall meeting on Tuesday, Obama said the news cycle moves too quickly for people to focus on his administration's solutions to long-term problems. In a New York Times interview, the president said he and his staff took ""a perverse pride"" in doing what was right rather than what was politically beneficial. Biden, meanwhile, has been going around saying that the Recovery Act and health care reform law are too complicated to explain. The alternative argument, put forward by (you guessed it) Republicans, is that Obama's problem has been competence--or, rather, lack thereof. Obama ran against the bumbling Bush administration as a smart, precise, and nonideological fellow. He is not. As evidence, Republicans cite not just the inability to pass programs but a general cluelessness. They offer overly rosy predictions about the unemployment rate after the Recovery Act, the initial assessment that the Times Square bomber was a lone operator, and the administration's lackadaisical response to the BP oil spill. Of course, the country had lost faith in Washington long before Obama was sworn in. That's why William Galston of the Brookings Institution argued--in November 2008--that the new president had to restore trust in government's competence before doing anything. Faith in Washington has not improved. That's why people worry not just about how bad things are now, but how bad they will get. Polls show that majorities of the public think Obama has made things worse. Voters are saying, ""Please stop trying to help me,"" says Joe Heck, a Republican candidate for Congress in Nevada. The president (inadvertently) helped the argument of those who would blame his communication skills as well as those who question his competence in his New York Times interview. Speaking about infrastructure spending in the stimulus plan, he said, ""The problem is, is that spending it out takes a long time, because there's really nothing--there's no such thing as shovel-ready projects."" Who says he can't communicate? This is a very pithy way of saying we didn't know what we were doing. If people remember anything at all from the stimulus debate, it is the administration's argument that the money would be spent immediately. There were plenty of projects that were ""shovel ready,"" we were told, and the White House Web site is full of such proclamations. ""In other words, it just needs money so construction can start,"" says a typical passage about a highway program in Reno (a battleground region in the race beteen Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Tea Party favorite Sharron Angle). Republicans jumped on Obama's quote from his New York Times interview immediately. They are already running against the wasteful spending in the stimulus bill. ""Now he tells us!"" wrote Mitch McConnell's spokesman on Twitter. In California, Carly Fiorina's Senate campaign sent out a press release: ""Does Boxer Agree With Obama? 'There's No Such Thing As Shovel-Ready Projects.' "" Politicians may debate the ongoing stimulative effect of the Recovery Act, but it has certainly given a boost to GOP talking points.

23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/booty_pageant.html	"Carl Paladino is right. Monday on Good Morning America, the Republican nominee for governor of New York said of his Democratic opponent: ""Andrew Cuomo said he took his children to a gay pride parade. I was at one in Toronto one time. ... It was a bunch of very extreme-type people in bikini-type outfits grinding at each other and doing these gyrations, and I certainly wouldn't let my young children see that."" On the Today show, Paladino told the same story: ""They wear these little Speedos, and they grind against each other, and it's just a terrible thing. Why would you bring your children to that?"" Cuomo's kids are 16, 16, and 13. I'm sure they've seen plenty of bikinis and grinding already. But Paladino is right about the gyrating Speedos. Gay pride parades aren't the best thing to take little kids to, especially if you want them to think of homosexuals as normal people. You'd be better off taking them to a picnic where boring gay couples chat about one another's kids and gardens. You'd be better off, in short, if gay people were married. I lived for 10 years along the route of the gay pride parade in Washington, D.C. The New York parade is bigger but similar. You can watch a video montage of it here. You'll see ordinary folks: grandparents  in sun hats, a parade queen in a tiara, a bicycling AIDS activist in a suit and bowtie, and a guy with a sign that says, ""You know what's so gay? My family."" But you'll also see scrotal pouches, jockstrapped drag queens, men with exposed butt cheeks, a guy with a flagpole in his pants, women wearing nothing but pasties, and a nearly naked dude grinding his crotch against a pole. The Onion, as my colleague Farhad Manjoo reminds me, once summarized these freak shows in a brilliant parody: ""Gay-Pride Parade Sets Mainstream Acceptance of Gays Back 50 Years."" Drag queens and butt-cheek boys don't represent gay America any more than Mardi Gras, Spring Break, and Jersey Shore represent straight America. The reality is less sexy. According to the most recent census estimates, 700,000 to 800,000 same-sex couples now live together. One-third of them are raising children. But most of these people don't refer to their partners as spouses, and few have gotten married. Legally, they can't. That's what makes Paladino's position so odd. ""I have no reservations whatsoever about gays, except for marriage,"" he said on GMA. ""I only have one problem with homosexuality, and that's their desire to be married."" On Today, he drew the same line. When Fox News asked him why he had brought up homosexuality, Paladino said the real difference between him and Cuomo was on gay marriage. But if skimpily clad pole dancers are bad models for kids, the obvious antidote is to legalize and promote gay marriage. Then politicians wouldn't have to march with boys in bikinis to show their support of equal rights. There'd be a Mardi-Gras-style parade for the nipple flaunters and a family-friendly parade for the boring gay couples. The couples could walk with their kids. And your kids could watch. Or maybe, if your kid turns out to be gay, you'd march in that parade with him. It might feel awkward, but you'd want the best for him. That's the dilemma Paladino is grappling with. He's Catholic. He's been taught that homosexuality is wrong. But his nephew, ""a wonderful boy,"" has come out to him. He wants the young man to be healthy, happy, and loved. That's who Paladino was talking about Monday when he called homosexuality ""a difficult life for a young person."" It's probably who he was thinking of a day earlier, when he  told a group of Orthodox Jews that ""my children and your children will be much better off and much more successful getting married and raising a family."" ""I don't want them to be brainwashed into thinking that homosexuality is an equally valid and successful option,"" the candidate said. But why must they choose between homosexuality and marriage? That dilemma isn't God's doing. It's Paladino's. On Monday, when he was asked whether homosexuality was a choice, Paladino struggled for an answer. ""I've had difficulty with that,"" he said. ""My nephew tells me he didn't have that choice."" But Paladino does have a choice. He can offer young gay people the same valid and successful life he commends to straight people. He can support same-sex marriage. Like Slate  on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter.

24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/youre_next_george_allen.html	"RICHMOND, Va.--On Saturday two men came here in search of the rejuvenating power of the Tea Party. Four years ago, both Rick Santorum and George Allen lost their bids to be re-elected to the U.S. Senate. The 2006 defeats had put paid to their national political ambitions. And both went down to defeat as punchlines, with Santorum's name turned into a sticky curse word by gay activists and Allen tainted by the word he used to insult an Indian-American Democratic tracker, ""Macaca."" Ah, but then came the Tea Party. Allen and Santorum appeared before almost 3,000 activists at the Virginia Tea Party Patriots Convention, each recasting himself as a grass-roots hero unfairly maligned by the left. Before and after his speech, Allen stood in a hallway of the Greater Richmond Convention Center, wife Susan by his side, shaking the hands of people who'd voted for him before and were pleading with him to run again. ""We get along very well,"" Allen tells me. ""They've invited me to speak to many of their events."" ""You have a voting record that they all very much appreciate,"" Susan chimes in. ""Oh, yeah!"" says Allen. ""So many of these things they talk about were things I was fighting for as a delegate."" He speaks with genuine-sounding admiration about how much the activists know. ""I like these folks that carry around the Constitution."" A few steps away, Dennis O'Connor is handing out the most popular lapel sticker of the weekend: bright orange and visible from 20 paces, it says, ""Guns Save Lives,"" a slogan of the Virginia Citizens Defense League. I ask what he'd think of a political comeback--which everybody now expects--from Allen. ""I have mixed feelings about him,"" says O'Connor. ""He's not ... bad. It depends, I guess, on who's running against him."" The Tea Partiers can afford to be choosy. While some in the movement are skittish about the elections next month, most are reading the polls and watching Fox News and finding out about candidate ""moneybombs"" and fully expecting a Republican landslide. There was nothing to dissuade them in Richmond, at an event co-sponsored by 33 local Tea Party groups. Dick Morris, the former adviser to Bill Clinton turned Republican enthusiasm-peddler, appeared at the conference to announce that Republicans were leading in 10 Senate races, and if the party wanted it badly enough, it could win 100 House seats. He rattled off the names of the Democrats to beat in Virginia's competitive races, but the crowd's reaction revealed where their emotions were. ""You  can beat Tom Perriello!"" said Morris. * There was an eruption of boos--evidence of the deep unpopularity of the cherubic freshman House member representing Charlottesville and chunks of southern Virginia, who had voted for most of President Obama's agenda. Americans for Prosperity, the Tea Party group that co-sponsored the conference, has anti-Perriello literature at its table. ""And the man who's going to beat him is Robert Hurt!"" said Morris. The cheers for that were much, much quieter. Hurt, a state senator whom Tea Partiers tried desperately to beat in the primary, generates next to no enthusiasm among conservatives, who fear he'll sell them out. (Many miss Virgil Goode, the man Perriello beat, who appears at the conference to say that billions of dollars can be cut from the budget ""if you don't mind making some people mad."") While Hurt is not at the conference, some of the other establishment-backed candidates are. They aren't as popular as the guys with no chance. Cases in point: Scott Rigell and Floyd Bayne. Rigell, a car dealer from the Democratic-held 2nd Congressional District, is an increasingly heavy favorite to win in November. No one expects Bayne to win. At a Saturday candidate forum, joined by independent conservative Kenny Golden, Rigell says nothing to alienate a Tea Partier. He closes the event by reciting Ronald Reagan's quote about freedom being at risk in every generation: ""It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where men were free."" Those final phrases reduce him almost to tears. But the audience in the half-empty hall is only half buying it. ""He plays both sides,"" grumbles Dan Talbot, a voter in the 2nd District who plans to support Golden. ""He gave $1,000 to Obama. Maybe he'll be a good conservative, but I don't know."" In the room next door is Bayne, an independent challenging Rep. Eric Cantor, the Republican whip. Cantor is one month away from driving the party to a congressional takeover, but he gets no credit from more than 400 people packed into a too-small venue. Bayne, who recently crashed a Cantor book-signing to challenge him to a debate, wins them over with attacks on the Bush legacy and mad-as-hell answers to questions. For example, what makes him qualified to beat Cantor and serve in Congress? ""I'm old enough,"" says Bayne. ""I live in the state. I don't have a criminal record. My family and I used to own three supermarkets in south Richmond. So I know how to balance a checkbook. I'd say that's a pretty good qualification."" That gets a laugh, so he follows it with a line from Christine O'Donnell: ""The bottom line is, I am you."" Bayne is bald, goateed, and built like the bouncer at a club with a $10 cover. Rigell is meticulously dressed, hair gone distinguished gray, and introduces himself by promising that he's running ""a very media-friendly campaign."" So I ask him what specifically he'd do to reduce unemployment if elected. ""It takes seven to nine years to get a wind farm permit,"" says Rigell. ""Now, in Great Britain, it takes 24 months. I have a unique approach to this. Get the relevant department heads together, have them form a team--the EPA, the Department of Energy, the ones that have a stake in them--and challenge them to tighten up the regulations and make them entirely effective."" I ask Rigell a question that Tea Partiers want their members of Congress to ask: What in the Constitution would give Congress the authority to do this? ""Does Congress have constitutional authority to have some influence over natural resources and the topics I'm referring to?"" Rigell wrestles with how to answer something so silly. ""Absolutely."" I offer Rigell's idea up to Bayne. He dismisses it. ""That would be something for the states to decide,"" he says. ""If it's not enumerated in the Constitution, it's the duty of the people and the states."" The man with the more practical idea is the one who'll probably wind up in Congress. But if he wins, he will be swept in by the sort of people who walked the halls on Friday and Saturday. At the same time, those sorts of people--which is to say, Tea Party activists--fully expect to be ignored once the election is over. ""They're going to get the pollsters in there on Nov. 3, Nov. 4,"" says Steve Bannon, one of the convention's organizers and the director of documentaries that played onsite, ""and they'll tell them they won because of the Pledge to America."" He refers to the long-winded GOP manifesto with a sort of sneer. Republicans sure look like they're listening. The Richmond convention, almost totally ignored by the national media, was the biggest such gathering since the start of the movement. Its sponsors included the NRA, FreedomWorks, the Heritage Foundation, and three members of the Virginia Legislature. After hours, attendees who paid $20 were treated to a massive party that conquered most of the ground floor of the downtown Marriott, with themed poker rooms, dance rooms, and one ""coffee house"" with a troubadour leading singalongs of ""Puff the Magic Dragon"" and ""Where Have All the Flowers Gone."" Virginia Attorney General Kenneth Cuccinelli came to pay his respects, as did Reps. Steve King of Iowa and Bob Goodlatte of Virginia. It's clear to the movement that the Republican Party owes it any victories that come next month. It's just unclear what will happen to the Tea Party after that. ""On Nov. 3, the Tea Party movement turns to Chapter 1, Page 1,"" says Mark Lloyd of the Lynchburg, Va., Tea Party. ""Up to now we've only been reading the dust jacket."" Like Slate on  Facebook.

25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/membership_has_its_privileges.html	"RENO, Nev.--It used to be that if you needed to get a divorce, you came here. Harry Reid came to Reno to stop one. Nevada voters want a split from the Senate majority leader, and he has less than a month to persuade them otherwise. So he stood in a campaign office Wednesday sounding a lot like the guy who finds himself on the doorstep, his clothes piled on the front lawn: Baby, remember all the good things I've done for you. Reid spoke at a press conference with local officials--some of them Republicans--who testified to all that he had done for the northern part of the state. He brought home federal money for watershed protection, new airport runways, an air-traffic control tower, methamphetamine abuse prevention programs, a shopping mall, and a local rail project. ""The railroad only listens to the man upstairs because they own everything, but they listened to Senator Reid,"" said Reno Mayor Bob Cashell, a Republican. No Reid effort was too small to mention. Sparks City Councilwoman Julia Ratti's list included the help Reid gave in getting her city six additional police officers. ""They're there because of Harry Reid."" Six jobs might lead to six votes--and that might make the difference in this close race. Polls show the race tied between Reid, the biggest target on the GOP hit list, and his Tea Party-backed opponent, Republican Sharron Angle. Polls also show that Reid is unpopular. According to an average of polls, his disapproval rating in the state is 52 percent whereas his approval rating is just 42 percent. When asked why he hadn't been campaigning more, Reid said: ""I've been running the country."" Maybe so, but from the press conference it also sounded like he was helping to run Reno, too--which is in the key swing county in the state. Reid talked about how he fought to keep garbage from California from being dumped in the area and praised the football coach of a local school. It sounded like he was running for lieutenant governor again. Reid, who is soft-spoken and slightly stooped, seems more like a church usher than the most powerful man in the U.S. Senate. Only his shoulder grab of the Reno mayor gave any hint that he was a member of the political class. His demeanor made it hard to tell whether he was being aggressive or defensive when he justified the millions he'd brought to Nevada by holding up a copy of the Constitution he carries with him every day. ""It is part of my constitutional duties to do congressionally directed spending,"" he said, holding the maroon volume given to him and signed by former Sen. Robert Byrd. ""I am vigorous in going forward with congressionally directed spending and I fight for it."" (The bumper sticker version of this is, ""No One Can Do More."") Like all Democratic politicians, Reid is trying to balance all his talk about all he has done with a steady insistence that it isn't enough. Nevada's unemployment rate is 14.4 percent, the highest in the country. For three years, it produced the most home foreclosures. Reid demonstrates his empathy by talking about his humble upbringing in the tiny mining town of Searchlight. His father worked for a man whose checks bounced, while his mother took in laundry from some of the 13 local brothels to make extra money. Extending his sense of empathy into perhaps dangerous territory, he tells a local newspaper how his mother struggled to afford Christmas presents. He says the experience helps him understand why people might blame him for their economic plight. ""I wanted to get some presents on Christmas morning,"" he told reporters and editors at the Reno Gazette-Journal. ""I was a very selfish little boy, and I was upset that my mother had to go through all this. Whose fault is this? And that's what people are going through. I didn't know who to blame but I wanted to blame somebody."" Reid's pitch echoed his effort a few months ago to reintroduce himself to Nevada voters. It didn't work, and since then his strategy has been to make Angle so toxic that while voters might be angry, they don't dare embrace a candidate who wants to dismantle Social Security and the federal Department of Education. In one ad Reid simply replays some of Angle's more controversial comments to portray her as beyond the pale. Reid's strategy worked initially in damaging Angle's reputation. But as the campaign wears on, the effect is diminishing. Angle, in turn, has been hitting Reid hard on the issue of immigration. ""Harry Reid, the best friend an illegal alien ever had,"" says a new ad. (Both campaigns have been slapped for misleading ads.) For candidates in other states, Angle is the personification of the dangerous Tea Party takeover of Washington. She gave her opponents new ammunition when she was captured recently on tape boasting that she and other Tea Party candidates would be able to shake things up because they would have special sway with Jim DeMint, the Tea Party's favorite senator, and Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell. ""We've got the power of a political machinery that we've never seen the likes of. That really gives me some juice. ... I go to Washington, D.C., now and I say 'I want to see Jim DeMint.' He's right there for me. ... I want to see Mitch McConnell, he's there."" Reid, by contrast, doesn't appear to be interested in shaking anything up. Though both the left and the right see the Senate as a broken institution, Reid does not. ""It's coming back,"" he told me, referring to the Senate. ""Mitch McConnell and I developed in the last six months--I know this is hard for people to comprehend--I think we've finally developed a relationship after all these years and I think things are getting better."" But how can he say that, I asked, when senators like DeMint are funding advertisements attacking him? Reid, characteristically, didn't find that outrageous. He said it didn't run afoul of the Senate's unwritten rules against attacking other senators, as some have claimed. ""Jim DeMint I know quite well,"" he said. ""Disagree with him but I like him. We talk all the time."" He stopped short of saying whether that gives him some juice. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter."

26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/ad_hominem.html	"Democrats will find plenty of scapegoats for their electoral losses in 2010, but high on the list will be Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. The Washington Post reported on Monday that interest groups have spent five times as much on this year's midterm elections as they did in 2006, and the money has gone overwhelmingly to Republicans--a spike that the Post says ""is made possible in part by a series of Supreme Court rulings unleashing the ability of corporations and interest groups to spend money on politics."" Note the key phrase ""in part."" We know recent Supreme Court rulings--including this year's  Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which opened the door for corporations and unions to spend unlimited amounts of their own treasury money (as opposed to forming a PAC) on broadcast endorsements--have changed the campaign finance game. We just don't know to what extent. * Independent expenditures trend up every four years anyway, so we'd expect to see more outside spending in 2010 than in 2006, even without a landmark Supreme Court decision. It's therefore premature to pin all the responsibility for the election spending boom on Citizens United. The rules that govern corporate- and union-funded advertising in 2010 were largely in place in 2008--an election that, while expensive, didn't spark the same suspicions of corporate manipulation. That year, the door for corporate spending in elections was already wide open. Citizens United just removed the hinges. After the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Act, better known as McCain-Feingold, passed in 2002, corporations and unions were banned from spending money on broadcast campaign ads in the one or two months before an election. (The ""window"" spans the 30 days before a primary and 60 days before a general.) The Supreme Court softened the ban with its 2007 decision in  Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life, ruling that corporations can fund ads right up to Election Day as long as the ads don't expressly endorse a candidate. For example, you can say, ""Candidate X supports terrible policies that we disagree with,"" but you can't say, ""Vote for Candidate X."" (Corporations called these ""issue ads."" The FEC called them ""sham issue ads"" that simply provide a loophole for endorsements.) In 2008, therefore, corporations could already finance campaign ads as long as they weren't too specific. Citizens United eliminated the ban altogether, and with it the distinction between ""issue ads"" and ""express endorsements."" Corporations and unions can now spend unlimited amounts of money on any kind of campaign ad they want, whenever they want. But the new landscape isn't all that different than it was in 2008. ""They could spend the money before,"" says Brad Smith, a former FEC commissioner and a professor at Capital University Law School. ""It just would have gone to issues ads run 60 days before an election. Now it goes to express advocacy."" So how much has Citizens United really influenced the rise in spending? It's hard to say. FEC reports are released monthly, so we won't be able to take full stock of corporate spending until after the election. But even then, not all groups that produce ads have to disclose their donors. Citizens United didn't change the disclosure rules for corporations and unions. But those that exercise their new spending liberties can avoid taking responsibility for their spending by exploiting pre-existing loopholes. For example, instead of spending money directly on an ad, which requires disclosure to the FEC, they give money to a 501(c)4 organization, which doesn't. (A 501(c)4 can keep its donors secret as long as its primary purpose is not campaigning.) These ""shadowy"" groups are nothing new. They're just more flush this year. The frustration for campaign finance reformers is that Citizens United didn't have to happen the way it did. Originally, the court case was about disclosure rules, says Fred Wertheimer of Democracy 21. The court told the litigants to come back and rebrief the case to make it about the ban on corporate spending instead. ""This case was actually brought by the five justices,"" says Wertheimer. ""They wanted to rule on it."" No doubt Citizens United set back the cause of campaign finance reform. But the jury is still out on its practical effects. Like Slate on  Facebook.

27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/10/unanimous_indecision.html	"HARTFORD--Let's get the wrestling metaphor out of the way: There were no killer holds on display at Monday night's debate between Richard Blumenthal and Linda McMahon. * Instead, both candidates for U.S. Senate emerged as sturdier versions of the selves that they have worked so hard to define. Blumenthal, the state's attorney general for the past two decades, is the dedicated public servant who has ""spent my life,"" he told the audience, ""trying to help people."" And McMahon, the determined businesswoman who built the World Wrestling Entertainment empire with her husband, wants to go to Washington just so she can ""create jobs."" The candidates represent a ""clear choice,"" a phrase each repeated, in terms of policy as well as experience. He is ready to vote to extend the Bush tax cut to all but the top 2 percent of earners. She wants to extend the cuts for the wealthiest as well as the middle class. He supports the health care bill. She wants to repeal it. No doubt they would vote differently in the Senate on everything from immigration to judicial appointments. But for this election, they're both tacking to the center. On my way out of the Bushnell Performing Arts Center, I heard two people joke that it was hard to tell which candidate was from which party. Certainly, the two competed over the number of times they could insert the words ""small business"" into every answer. Blumenthal distanced himself from his party by criticizing President Obama's bailout of Wall Street and the stimulus: Both were flawed by ""inadequate accountability,"" he said. McMahon, on the other hand, defended her support for the bailout. Then she backed so far away from the suggestion that she favors lowering the minimum wage, as a new Blumenthal ad claims, that she clambered onto the ground her opponent was standing on. ""We've taken the same position,"" McMahon said of the minimum wage. ""We both say we should take a look at it."" In the best exchanges of the night, Blumenthal and McMahon asked each other direct questions. ""Why have you and WWE bought your products in China, Pakistan, and other countries?"" Blumenthal asked, referring to the fact that many WWE-licensed toys are not made in the United States. McMahon had an admirably straight answer: ""Because we do not have the kind of policies here that are conducive to manufacturing."" But then she reverted to the shopworn Republican solution of lowering the corporate tax rate, noting that it's only 12 percent in Ireland. Blumenthal's dig in response was equally rote: ""Linda McMahon has to be held accountable for those choices she made that deprived American workers of jobs by sending them overseas."" In her question to Blumenthal, McMahon tried for a gotcha moment. ""I'm very proud that I've created more than 600 jobs in the state of Connecticut,"" she said. ""How many jobs have you created?"" Blumenthal started slow in his answer, and I thought she had him. Then he picked up momentum with specifics about how he'd saved jobs as attorney general by preventing GM from closing an auto dealership. ""I know about how government can help preserve jobs,"" he said. ""Government, government, government,"" McMahon retorted. ""Government does not make jobs. It's very simple. An entrepreneur takes a risk."" ""I'm not going to be an entrepreneur as a senator,"" Blumenthal shot back, winning a brief explosion of muffled laughter before the audience remembered it had been told to keep quiet. Blumenthal gave a small shy grin. McMahon did not. A few minutes later, Blumenthal had to face the inevitable question about his misleading statements about his military record. (He suggested that he served in Vietnam rather than stateside.) This is the subject of a new McMahon attack ad that ends in an ominous voice-over: ""If he lied about Vietnam, what else is he lying about?"" Blumenthal was ready for it. ""There is nothing new in this ad,"" he said. ""I'm proud of my military service. On a few occasions out of hundreds I described it inaccurately. I regret it. I take full responsibility for it. It was not intentional, but that is no excuse. I want to say that I'm sorry."" Later, it was Blumenthal's turn to go on the offensive. He accused McMahon of taking $10 million in tax credits while laying off 10 percent of WWE's workforce. ""There's a certain irony in my opponent talking about health care because she denies it to the wrestlers,"" Blumenthal said. ""Her company is under investigation for denying health care to her employees."" McMahon angrily responded that WWE's independent contractors do in fact have health care coverage for accidents in the ring. She continued, ""I find it a little bit unusual, maybe it's just a coincidence, that in the 20 some years WWE has been in Connecticut, we've never been investigated or fined. This is the only time, and it was just after this campaign got going."" Instead of ratcheting up the dispute, Blumenthal got all huffy and lawyerly. ""As you well know, my jurisdiction is exclusively civil,"" he said, not making clear that he was talking about his scope of duties as attorney general. ""The allegations against WWE are criminal in nature."" Oh well, at least he got the word criminal in there. And in his closing statement, Blumenthal inched closer to exploiting a serious McMahon weakness that he's previously left to the media: The deaths of a series of young WWE wrestlers, perhaps (probably?) in connection with the illegal use of steroids encouraged by the sport. ""My opponent has built her fortune while putting profits ahead of people--even now, she refuses to recognize that steroids can cause long-term health problems,"" Blumenthal said. As we filed out, the consensus among the political journalists around me was that nothing in this debate would change the minds of voters, few of whom appear to be up for grabs in Connecticut, anyhow. Most polls show a close race, although Nate Silver is betting heavily on Blumenthal, given the small number of undecideds. (And here's a new poll that shows Blumenthal up by 12 points.) If Blumenthal's edge is solid, then he probably did well enough. In politics, if not always in wrestling, you can win by not losing. Like  Slate on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter.

In the following weeks, I'll try to answer some of these questions. Feel free to weigh in with answers--or with more political questions--at  slatepolitics@gmail.com or in the comments section below. Here are this week's questions: Will the Republican presidential race get nasty quickly? David Plouffe, the architect of Barack Obama's 2008 victory, says he wouldn't mind at all it if Sarah Palin were to be the GOP presidential nominee in 2012. She seems like the leader of the conservative movement, but a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that the Republican Party has no clear front-runner for 2012. That might be even better for Plouffe and his client. No clear front-runner means a messy fight to the nomination. In 1996 and 2008, the GOP base was suspicious of front-runners Bob Dole and John McCain. That led to primary challenges that drained both candidates of money and energy. This election cycle--and forgive me, I'm already referring to 2012--the battle for the direction of the Republican Party seems more intense than it was two or 14 years ago. There's the Tea Party vs. the establishment and, as Pat Buchanan put it, the Tea Party vs. the War Party. Will the GOP presidential primary be especially ugly this time? Was the Democrats' tax-cut gambit a big mistake? At President Obama's news conference three weeks ago, he started a new fight with Republicans. The GOP, he said, was holding tax cuts to the middle class ""hostage"" in order to get tax cuts for the wealthy. The idea was to use the issue to frame the choice in the election--budget-busting millionaire lovers vs. protectors of the middle class. Not all Democrats thought this was a great idea. One veteran strategist pointed out that voters who care the most about taxes tend to be Republicans. Another strategist said the president and his advisers overestimate the impact of their issues. ""First health care was supposed to help us, then Wall Street reform, now taxes,"" the adviser said. ""Policy fights from Congress don't really help. Sometimes they hurt."" (The reason, he went on to explain, was that these votes don't really help the vulnerable members who are in toss-up districts, where the president and the Democratic Party are unpopular. If they vote for the legislation, the benefits of the legislation aren't easy to sell to voters and if they don't it's never really possible to distance themselves from the Democratic party that was pushing the legislation.) Now it has come to pass that Democrats couldn't really win that fight over the tax cuts, in part because so many Democrats in the House and Senate were against the president's position. Proof of that is the Democrats who voted against adjourning the House's session this week. House Minority Leader John Boehner said the vote to adjourn was a vote to raise taxes, because if lawmakers left town without a vote on the tax cuts, they were implicitly signaling their intention to allow the tax cuts to expire. As it turns out, the motion to adjourn passed by a single vote, with 39 Democrats against it. In the end, Democrats were unable to move the tax bill. But will they win the political argument? White House aides are still trying to make the case--they've even put out a new video in which White House economic adviser Austan Goolsbee takes to the whiteboard. But as a sign of who muddled the whole business has become, Republicans are making their own case using a White House video, too. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook.

29	29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/09/buck_party.html	"Yesterday I asked what readers thought of President Obama's call to Democrats to ""buck up,"" from a recent  Rolling Stone interview. Lots of you responded. (This sidebar has the raw--in some cases, quite raw--responses.) I asked Georgetown University linguistics professor Deborah Tannen what she thought of the president and Vice President Joe Biden's use of the phrase. ""The president and Vice President are frustrated (surprise!) that the administration's accomplishments are being overlooked as progressives and Democrats focus on what they did not get,"" she wrote. "" 'Buck up' acknowledges disappointment--people are asked to 'buck up' under adversity--but also indirectly (by implication) admonishes the addressees for being lily-livered and self-pitying, and kind of challenges them to draw on their inner strength (a perhaps masculine-inflected inner strength) to muster their resources and continue the struggle."" The president's remarks were aimed at closing what Gallup shows to be a vast enthusiasm gap between the two parties. But your reactions were mixed, suggesting the challenge he faces. Based on the more than 2,000 responses to my previous story, it is possible to develop a taxonomy of Democratic voters by the way you interpreted the president's call to buck up. Herewith, including examples: Motivated by Obama: ""Amen!""Motivated by the alternative: ""Republican party and tea party are not serious about governing.""Patient: ""Suck it up Dems. Did you really expect everything to be fixed in a mere *2* years?!""Understanding: ""Realize that you are fighting an entrenched status quo that will stop at nothing to regain power.""Self-hating: ""Obama is right Progressives are too feckless.""Strategic: ""Agree, health care and financial reform have been good, but the problem: Have to let people know!""Tactical: ""Being busy is no excuse, phone bank!""Civic-minded: ""Being a citizen is hard work! It takes dedication to constantly create a nation we want to live in.""Entrepreneurial: ""First person to put that on a $15 baby blue t shirt with a bucking donkey above it wins!""Soul-searching: ""For those who think the President has not done enough, ask your self, what could I have done.""Athletic: ""Bend over.""Angry but still voting: ""Buck off. I will vote, but at some point the rest is up to you.""Just angry: ""No public option, no ENDA, no DADT, and deadlines you set then didnt enforce. Buck up for what?""Angry sarcasm: ""Puleeeeez! You make a great speech... every 2 years.""Nuclear-strength anger: ""Fuck off, you sold out our civil liberties and listened to the weakest people in your administration.""
