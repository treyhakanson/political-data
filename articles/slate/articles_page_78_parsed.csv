In Virginia and Wisconsin--two must-wins for Romney--Obama leads by 5 and 3 points, respectively. Even if Obama fails to regain his pre-debate momentum, statewide popularity for Democratic senatorial candidate Tim Kaine could push Virginia's 13 electoral votes into Obama's column. Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania, Obama has held firm to his lead of 8 points, a notably small decline from his 11-point high following the Democratic National Convention. The president's Democratic base remains strong in many of the places he needs it most. See Barack Obama's earlier rays of hope. See Mitt Romney's earlier rays of hope.

1	1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/vp_debate_joe_biden_tried_to_re_energize_democrats_with_his_attacks_digs.html	"In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden found a way to be both a participant and the guy in the Barcalounger at home yelling at the television. He interrupted Paul Ryan, moderator Martha Raddatz, and even himself with interjections, sighs, and quips. He appealed to the heavens, he looked to the floor. With all the activity, he surely shed calories. When he wasn't engaged in those antics, Biden laughed and smiled to himself as if Ryan had sold him something illegal that he'd just consumed. At times his treatment was so dismissive, he seemed only a few threads of restraint from reaching across the table and patting Ryan on the head. Biden won the debate, but it was a qualified victory. He energized Democrats who had been down in the dumps since the president's supine performance, but he also energized Republicans who found him rude and dishonest. Swing voters might have been turned off, too. But it probably doesn't matter since they're going to vote for the top of the ticket. It was close in the post-debate polls of undecided voters. It was close in the post-debate polls. In a CBS poll of undecided voters, 50 percent thought Biden had won; only 31 percent thought the same of Ryan. In the CNN poll, 48 percent thought Ryan won. Only 44 percent thought Biden came out on top.* There's an old line attributed to Bill Clinton: It's hard for the other guy to talk when your fist is in his mouth. Biden was up to his elbow. That thrilled Democrats. Speaking of himself, Barack Obama said that he was ""too polite"" in the first debate. No one will say that of Joe Biden. Biden's performance was aimed at one thing: painting the Romney and Ryan agenda as a flim-flam operation. He did it with style as much as substance. Looking directly at the camera, he said, ""folks, follow your instincts,"" in the middle of an argument about whether Romney's tax plan added up. Before the debate, a Romney staffer had said one of the things that had worked well for the GOP nominee a week ago was that while voters may not have understood his policy ideas, he sounded like he understood them, which gave viewers confidence in the candidate. Biden was trying to make the same kind of transference. If he could convey exasperation and frustration with Ryan's lack of specificity, the plans that didn't add up, and the broader claims from the Republican team, perhaps he'd be able to make people doubt the entire Republican enterprise. Biden hit the thesaurus hard. He blurted out that Ryan was offering ""malarkey."" At one point, he referred to a Ryan riff as ""a bunch of stuff."" He called out a ""bizarre statement"" and several times talked about ""loose talk"" and ""slipshod"" claims.  (What? No hokum?) The audience for the Biden routine was the middle class. As expected, Biden brought up the secretly recorded video tape in which Romney wrote off 47 percent of the country as dependents and moochers. ""These people are my mom and dad--the people I grew up with, my neighbors,"" said Biden, at the start of an extended riff defending everyday middle-class Americans. Ryan responded with his own number, 10 percent, which is the unemployment rate in Scranton, Pa. He then blew that fact into a more extended argument about the lousy Obama economy. That argument then pivoted to a defense of Romney, which included a great story about how the Republican nominee paid the college bills of a man in his church whose children had been paralyzed in a car crash. The exchange was like much of the debate: Biden was defending the middle class, while Ryan was defending Romney. Biden hammered Ryan's plan to change Medicare and pointed out that the next president would appoint justices to the Supreme Court that could limit abortion rights. On international affairs, though Biden floundered on Libya, he pressed Ryan on Iraq and Afghanistan, questioning effectively whether the logical conclusion of Romney's aggressive stance toward Iran and Afghanistan meant a deeper military commitment to conflict. ""The last thing we need is another war,"" said Biden. Biden's greatest asset was his passion. Though he might have been over the top, it was possible for a viewer to conclude that he was simply passionate about the middle class. That is something President Obama will not easily duplicate if he hopes to use Biden's performance as a teaching tool for his outing next week. Biden looked like he wanted to be there. Obama will have to find a way to access some measure of that emotion. Emotion doesn't work for all things. Indeed, the debate began with a question about the attack on American diplomats in Libya, where the administration is losing credibility by the news cycle. The Ryan team knew the Libya question would be asked first. They had prepared to make an over-arching claim about Obama's penchant for blaming others. Today, a senior official in the Obama campaign suggested that the Libya issue had become politicized because Romney and Ryan had pushed it. ""They first blamed the YouTube video. Now they're trying to blame the Romney-Ryan ticket for making this an issue,"" said Ryan. The goal was to make a larger claim: that Obama has run out of ideas, so he and his team are only able to offer excuses. Ryan's execution wasn't great, but things are not going so well in Obama-land that all the smirking and cockiness are warranted. As the economy improves (or people start to think it's improving), the Romney camp may need to rely on a broader argument about Obama's incompetence. Biden tried to turn Ryan into Dan Quayle. Ryan didn't fit the mold. He had done his homework and held his own, defending his Medicare plans and insisting that the economic growth created by reducing tax rates would allow Romney to keep his budget promises. Republicans won't be depressed the way Democrats were after Obama's weak performance. Ryan did not give a particularly fabulous articulation of the Romney plan for the middle class, but that's the candidate's job. (Neither man talked much about plans for the future--except in the context of defending their plans against the other man's attacks.) Ryan also did not answer questions about specifics, which is an issue that still dogs the campaign. The worst moment for Ryan was when he had to own up to the two letters he wrote asking for stimulus funds. Biden painted Ryan as a phony, railing against the stimulus on the one hand and asking for money on the other. This is the larger Obama narrative on Romney-Ryan. But Biden calling Ryan out as a stimulus hypocrite didn't feel like a moment that people will remember. (It would have helped if he had the letters, but the debate rules forbid any visual aids.) If the Obama camp can ever find an example that sticks, it will reinforce their broad claim against Romney and his running mate. Biden's performance was good for the home team, but spectators won't be talking about it days from now. He didn't mint a line that will live on, but Democrats didn't need that. They know all the lines. They just wanted to hear someone from their team say them. Correction, Oct. 12, 2012: This article originally stated that both polls were of undecided voters. Only the CBS poll was. The CNN poll was of registered voters. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"	At the Veep Debate, Biden Gave Ryan a Full Workout	['Paul', 'Romney', 'Obama']	['abortion']
2	2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/vp_debate_foreign_policy_joe_biden_mopped_the_floor_with_paul_ryan.html	"It wasn't as lopsided as Gov. Romney's win over President Obama last week, but Joe Biden mopped the floor with Paul Ryan in their debate Thursday night, on foreign as well as domestic policy, though on one big issue--the drawdown of troops in Afghanistan--the vice president had his facts wrong. The first issue on the table was Libya. Rep. Ryan correctly chided the Obama administration for taking a week to admit that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was a terrorist assault, not a protest that got out of hand, and for not protecting the facility with more Marines. Biden replied that Obama's statements reflected the intelligence community's analysis and that when the analysis changed, so did his statements. He said that Thomas Pickering, a veteran ambassador, was conducting an investigation. He also noted that Congress, with Ryan's vote, had reduced the budget for embassy security by $300 million--and recalled that Romney came out, right after the attack, and gave a press conference before knowing any of the facts: hardly presidential behavior. That exchange was probably a draw. The truth is that both sides have something to be seriously embarrassed about. The next issue: Iran, and here Ryan was as weak as Romney was in his foreign-policy speech earlier this week. Ryan charged that Iran is closer to getting nuclear weapons than it was when Obama took office, that the ayatollahs aren't taking Obama's threats seriously, and that the sanctions--which, he admitted, are crippling Iran's economy--are as strong as they are only because of congressional insistence. Biden laughed at that statement, and rightly so. Congress has had very little to do with sanctions; Obama has managed to rally the entire Western world to join in the sanctions and, at least to some degree, the Eastern world (Russia, anyway) as well. As for the line, which Ryan repeated, that Obama went on a morning talk show rather than meet with Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, Biden said that he sat in on a phone conversation between Obama and Netanyahu that went on for longer than an hour, during which they agreed on the main points. Netanyahu, for instance, supports the sanctions. Martha Raddatz, the moderator and longtime war correspondent, asked Ryan what he and Romney would do to make the ayatollahs take their threat more seriously? Ryan had no answer. Several points, possibly game, to Biden. On the defense budget, Ryan denied that Romney wanted to increase military spending by $2 trillion over the next 10 years. Rather, he merely wanted not to reduce the budget by $478 billion, as Obama was planning to do--to say nothing of the $500 billion extra that would be cut automatically if Congress fails to strike a debt deal. Biden noted that the Joint Chiefs have no problem with the $478 billion cut--that they favor a ""smaller, leaner"" army with more special forces--and that Ryan himself voted for the sequestration pact that might trigger across-the-board cuts in the federal budget. The assessment is a little tricky, since the Chiefs--though they did build a fairly sensible strategy about Obama's cuts--would always find something to do with more money; they are generals, after all. But Ryan didn't explain where he'd get the money for $2 trillion in extra spending (which indeed his budget plan does advocate), or how he'd spend it. So point to Biden. On Afghanistan, things get a little sneaky on both sides. Ryan first denounced Obama's timetable to withdraw all troops by 2014, saying the move could reverse our gains and leave Kabul vulnerable to a Taliban takeover. But then he said that he and Romney support the 2014 date--as do all the NATO allies and Afghan President Hamid Karzai--as long as the commanders say it's sensible. Biden said we're definitely leaving in 2014; that's the NATO policy. We came to beat back al-Qaida, get rid of bin Laden, and train the Afghan army to take over the fight. That's what we've done. He also said that when Obama announced his troop-surge in December 2009 he said ""the surge would be out"" by the summer of 2011. That's not quite true. Obama said that he would begin to withdraw troops by that summer. How many would depend on the situation on the ground. When the time came, Gen. David Petraeus, the commander at the time, and Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recommended pulling out only a few thousand troops until the fighting season was over. Obama overruled their recommendation. On this point, Ryan was right. But then Ryan got his facts wrong. He said that the U.S. military in Afghanistan is performing the same mission--counterinsurgency --but with fewer troops. In fact, they are not still doing counterinsurgency (COIN) to nearly the same degree, not in the same sense as its advocates defined it (nation-building, reform of governance, and so forth). In fact, Obama decided to withdraw all 30,000 of the surge troops--leaving the original 68,000 until 2014--because he realized that the COIN strategy wasn't working and never would work, in part because the Afghan government was too corrupt to make it work. He scaled back the mission to fighting the Taliban and training the Afghan army; for that mission, the surge troops weren't necessary. On substance then, a draw, though on a political scale, Biden may have scored points. He kept emphasizing that we will pull out, adding, ""It doesn't 'depend' for us."" Since almost nobody, not even many Republican lawmakers, want to stay in Afghanistan much longer, this is a winning position in public opinion. When the debate returned to foreign policy, the first issue to come up was Syria. Biden once again ridiculed Romney-Ryan's ""loose talk"" about doing more without saying what it is they would do. Do you want to send American troops to Syria, he asked? Ryan said of course not. The problem, he said, is that Obama attempted a diplomatic solution for too long, hoping the United Nations would impose a settlement, even though Russia would have a veto. Romney would have worked with allies earlier--though to do what, Ryan never said. (In his foreign policy speech this week, Romney too never said he would send heavy arms to the Syrian opposition; only that somebody should.) Overall, then: Biden finessed a few points, but he spoke with a command of the issues and with a contempt for Romney-Ryan's ""bluster"" and ""malarkey."" (It will be interesting to see the net effect of this obviously deliberate stance. It will no doubt gin up the Democratic base, but were the independents delighted, turned off, or indifferent?) Ryan meanwhile recited the party lines, railing against Obama's ""weakness,"" lack of ""credibility,"" and tendency to ""apologize for our values."" But he was asked to put meat on these claims, to provide examples of where the charges were true or how Romney would make things better--and he had no answer."

An added bonus: a federal appeals court last week reinstated early voting in Ohio for all voters. One in five Ohio voters has already voted, and 63 percent of early voters supported Obama. If Obama can hang on to a solid lead in any battleground state, the Buckeye State would be the one to have. As politicos frequently like to note, no Republican has ever lost Ohio and still won the presidential election. And right now the FiveThirtyEight forecast estimates a 40.4 percent probability that Ohio will provide the decisive electoral vote. See Barack Obama's earlier rays of hope.

The phony, irritating, made-for-Twitter era pre-fight ""expectation-setting"" is over. Republicans won't even pretend that Joe Biden's synapses still crackle. On Wednesday, after a modest amount of Internet buzz over a Ryan interview that ended poorly, the Romney campaign compared Ryan's local TV schedule with Biden's failure to do any national TV hits since he endorsed gay marriage back in May. The Weekly Standard gave anonymity to a ""Republican source,"" who gloated that ""Joe Biden gets used by the Obama Campaign like Bernie from 'Weekend at Bernie's.' "" If Romney-Ryan tried to praise the veep, who would believe them? The three funniest syllables in any GOP stump speech are ""Joe Biden."" The titters start at the mention of his name; they continue as some Republican quotes his latest ""gaffe."" Back in the summer, American Crossroads blew some of its bottomless cash reserves on a Web video compilation of Biden missteps, thanking Obama for keeping Biden on the ticket. (The idea that Biden wouldn't be on the ticket was a classic, baseless August political story.) According to Pew, only 34 percent of people expect Biden to beat Paul Ryan tonight, even though they barely know who Ryan is. Only 39 percent of these voters actually like the president. I'm not even sure that the ""Bernie"" joke is wrong. When I last asked the Obama campaign for Biden access, I was told that the veep's plane was small and filled--literally, man--with traveling press. So Biden enters the ring underrated, and Ryan enters it as a mystery. That's obviously good for Biden. Ryan has outmatched mostly hapless Democrats in the eight debates he has competed in for his thoroughly safe House seat. Biden has lost two presidential primaries--one gracefully, one with maximum pain and humiliation--and coasted through some debates for his U.S. Senate seat. After spending some time with the Biden tapes, I'm convinced he's being undervalued. He has a skill that now evades Barack Obama. He comes off like he actually cares about politics and wants to keep his job. And he's gotten much better with time. The first televised Biden debates, the ones that nearly ended his career, date from 1987. He was 44. His hairline had not yet been corrected by scientists. On May 8, Sen. Gary Hart quit the race. On June 9, Biden jumped into it, filling the white-guy charisma gap in a field that included Michael Dukakis, Bruce Babbitt, Dick Gephardt, and Al Gore. (I say ""white guy"" because Jesse Jackson had more charisma than all of these guys put together and multiplied by the factor of Newt.) This Biden is barely recognizable to the modern audience. His voice was higher than it is now, which made him sound meaner. His first national ""gaffe"" of consequence came when a possible supporter asked about his law school credentials. ""I think I probably have a much higher IQ than you, I suspect,"" snapped Biden, raising his hand to his head, as if he'd tattooed the number up there. The debate that killed his campaign was actually a low-key forum on farm issues, where Biden repeatedly insisted that ""statistics"" didn't convey how bad things were, and that as president he'd ""re-establish a sense of community and one-ness."" It was at the end of his debate that Biden accidentally failed to credit Neil Kinnock, the golden-throat British Labour Party leader, for a riff about why he'd succeeded beyond the ambitions of his ancestors. But he really did dress that up in lace. The borrowed line became something that Biden ""started thinkin' on the way over here."" Biden quit the race and followed the pattern of senators who'd had their dreams crushed in front of national TV audiences. He focused on the work. In his subsequent debates, as he grayed and aged, Biden developed a debate technique that was half passion and half statistics, spit out as from a T-shirt cannon. In 1996, Biden drew a challenge from Raymond ""Ray"" Clatworthy, a Delaware businessman with no political experience. These debates give us the Biden we recognize, joshing with two fringe candidates, alternating between offense at Clatworthy's personal attacks and offense at his ignorance. In the first debate, the candidates took seats at a table and leaned forward to attack. Clatworthy was a factoid machine, repeating numbers and votes and ratings that made Biden sound like the greatest living threat to the Treasury. Biden kept his hand on his chin, jumping in to accuse Clatworthy of making up numbers. At one point Clatworthy claimed that Americans for Democratic Action rated Biden the most liberal senator. ""On spending, Ray?"" asked Biden. ""The ADA gives me 95 percent on spending? You're mixin' your apples and oranges, Ray."" Later, at that table, Clatworthy tried to thread the needle on his abortion stance. He opposed Roe; he would limit abortion through sound legislation. Biden interrupted him, mocking his callousness. ""How would you do it?"" he asked. ""If you don't mind my saying, how would you do it? If you get here, within three months you'll have to vote on this. Will you vote yes on a Constitutional amendment to ban abortion?"" The Clatworthy debates give us a better idea of Biden's style than the Palin debate of 2008. That match-up was sui generis. Biden's job then: Just don't do anything that would make a swing voter root for the put-upon Hockey Mom. But Biden's job, in his Senate races, was to humiliate Republicans by pointing out how cruel their policies were, and how little they knew. Abortion and women's safety issues, which he could never deploy against Palin, are the tools he knows best. When Biden meets Ryan tonight, it would be out of character if he didn't try to mire him in a discussion of pro-life bills and ""legitimate rape."" Plenty of pols use soft language when they have to discuss those issues. Biden doesn't. Really, whenever an issue can be mined for pathos, Biden thrives. In the second Clatworthy debate, after the Republican failed to trap the senator into a joint PAC money-pledge press conference (""See if anyone shows up and pays attention to you,"" said Biden), moderators switched the discussion to entitlements. It was 1996, and the fiscal problem du jour was whether to balance the budget by 1999 or by 2002. Clatworthy suggested that a privatized Social Security system and privatized Veterans Affairs administration would be more efficient. Biden reacted like he'd just heard a Tourettes patient question the death toll of the Holocaust. ""Unlike any other section of the economy, we guaranTEE the veterans,"" he said, flashing his teeth on the exaggerated final syllable. ""GuaranTEE a contract for their health care. Is the private market going to guaranTEE that?"" Biden was saying this to a novice, slightly clammy opponent. Paul Ryan is several leagues better than the businessman with the talking points. ""He will spout figures with winsome authority,"" predicts Jonathan Chait, ""and Biden will come off an angry old man."" Absolutely, that could happen. Also possible: Biden could show the pulse that hairshirted Democrats wanted Barack Obama to show last week. Obama's a bore when he talks about legislating. Biden can brag in detail about Democratic bills like they're his grown children heading off for college. Presented with the choice to mellow out or to emote about the threat of Republicanism, he always walks through Door No. 2."

In Ohio, a slew of unions (including the AFL-CIO) is flexing newfound spending rights in an attempt to tip the race toward Obama, and it seems to be working. Even as Romney's debate bounce refuses to recede nationally, Ohio has remained stubbornly Democratic, due in part to its unions' aggressive canvassing and advertising. Last year, Ohio unions were integral to the defeat of the Republican legislature's union-crushing collective bargaining law; this year they may be the key to Obama's second term.

Mitt Romney met with editors of the Des Moines Register yesterday and dropped a bombshell. ""Romney promises no abortion legislation,"" says the Associated Press. ""Romney: No abortion legislation,"" says Politico. ""Romney says no plans to restrict abortion,"" says Agence France-Presse. Nope. That isn't what Romney said. This is a man with a long history of using technicalities to disguise his abortion views. You have to read his exact words, with attention to the loopholes. So let's back up and listen to the full audio of Romney's remarks. The exchange takes place about 14 minutes into the meeting. A Register staffer asks: ""Do you intend to pursue any legislation specifically regarding abortion?"" Romney answers: ""There's no legislation with regards to abortion that I'm familiar with that would become part of my agenda."" I count at least three loopholes in that sentence: legislation, familiar, and agenda. Legislation was a gift from the questioner. By using that word, she allowed Romney to avoid mentioning the most important thing he would do to roll back abortion rights: appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade. Nor did Romney have to acknowledge any other non-legislative changes he would make, though he did cite one: an executive order against federal funding of international family planning organizations that support abortion rights. Midway through his sentence, Romney added a second caveat: that I'm familiar with. The National Right to Life Committee, whose PAC has endorsed Romney, currently lists 23 ""Key Bills in Congress"" that it supports. Nine of the 14 House bills on the list have more than 100 sponsors each. Three have more than 218 sponsors--a voting majority. Most of these bills deal with late-term abortion, public funding, parental notification, and the right of health care institutions to withhold abortions or abortion information--issues on which Romney has made clear he'll stand with pro-lifers. If these bills get to his desk, he'll sign them. But for now, he can claim not to be ""familiar"" with them. My agenda is a classic Romney dodge. He has used it on this issue before. On May 27, 2005, when Romney was governor of Massachusetts, he brushed aside press queries about his abortion position, claiming that ""my personal philosophical views about this issue"" would only ""distract from what I think is a more critical agenda"" on jobs and education. A week later, when reporters asked about his views on abortion and Roe, he refused to answer them, saying, ""I don't want to get into a philosophical discussion of a federal law and a case that's been in the books for 30 years and that is distracting from my agenda."" What's instructive about that pair of 2005 statements, in retrospect, is that they came less than two months before Romney declared himself pro-life, announced his opposition to Roe, and vetoed legislation to provide morning-after pills. When Romney says something isn't ""part of my agenda,"" he doesn't mean he won't do it. He just means he doesn't want to discuss it with the press or the public. To Romney, my agenda means ""the stuff I'm happy to talk about."" Romney's whole track record on abortion is a history of feints and hedges. In 1993, he told leaders of the Mormon Church that he had to run as a pro-choicer for the U.S. Senate because, according to his campaign poll, this was the only way to get elected in Massachusetts. Then, six years later, when he was thinking about running for office in Utah, he reframed his position as pro-life. Then, when the governorship of Massachusetts opened up in 2002, he repositioned himself as a pro-choicer. Then, as he prepared to seek the 2008 Republican presidential nomination, he recast himself as a pro-lifer. At every turn, he has taken the angle that looked safest politically. And each time, he has given himself an escape clause. If you want to understand what will happen to the no-legislation assurance Romney gave to the Register yesterday, look at what happened to the assurances he gave to voters in Massachusetts a decade ago. In 2002, as a candidate for governor, he repeatedly promised to ""preserve and protect a woman's right to choose."" After he was elected, he reinterpreted that statement as a pledge not to ""change our abortion laws either to restrict abortion or to facilitate it."" This allowed him to veto pro-choice legislation. Then, as he moved on from Massachusetts and began to court pro-lifers as a presidential candidate, he reinterpreted his no-change policy this way: ""Every time I faced a decision as governor that related to life, I came down on the side of life."" That's why you need to spot the weasel words up front. In the end, with Romney, they're all that matters.

It's Sunday, and the traffic's worse than usual. The Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta has filled the city and its suburbs--like Rio Rancho--with tourists. Nobody really minds. As we park and walk into the chapel, we can see the balloons lift off in the main field. The ushers are just especially thankful that we skipped the carnival food and inflated cartoon characters in favor of a sermon. We're expecting something special. Today, Oct. 7, is the fifth annual Pulpit Freedom Sunday. At least 1,500 pastors will give sermons about politics. This is raw politics, premeditated violations of the IRS's tax exemption guidelines. Their message: Come and get us. Go on. Sue us. See what happens. Calvary Chapel's pastor, Robert Hall, was one of the first guys into the pool. In 2008, he joined 30 other pastors and gave a political sermon. Nothing happened. (He'd given $700 to Mike Huckabee's presidential campaign, but was otherwise on the campaign sidelines.) In 2009, the number of pastors expanded, and Hall gave another sermon. Nothing. Every year he'd talk, and the IRS would ignore him. Finally, on ""the Monday before Easter"" this year, the IRS sent him notice it was ""looking into it."" Hall offers me the drink he usually gets after a sermon--a salted caramel mocha from the chapel's cafe, served in a Tigger mug--and pronounces the threat to be ineffective. ""I just laughed at the subtlety. That's almost harassment. But apart from that they've never said a word to me."" That's the beauty and the problem of Pulpit Freedom Day. Churches, by long-standing tax law and constitutional tradition, are tax-exempt 501c3s. They don't even have to apply for 501c3 status. They don't have to file 990 tax returns. The Obama administration has not shaken down churches--literally none of them have been prosecuted for political speech since Obama took office, since the IRS dropped a case against a pastor in Rep. Michele Bachmann's district. But pastors argue that the 1954 ""Johnson amendment"" has had a silencing effect, as Lyndon Johnson intended when he changed the law governing tax-exempt organizations. The amendment threatened revocation of status for institutions that ""participate in, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of--or in opposition to--any candidate for public office."" That didn't stop religious leaders from barreling into politics. One year after the amendment passed, Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was leading a bus boycott in Montgomery. But today's conservative pastors pine for a time when they could mobilize their congregations without any sort of end-runs or careful wording. In their Oct. 7 sermons, the Pulpit Freedom pastors describe a culture that is at war with them and a government that makes war on them. So, in California, Jim Garlow gets into the weeds on fiscal policy and explains just how irresponsible the federal government is. ""When somebody talks about a Balanced Budget Amendment that holds Congress not to spend more than they take in, that holds them to 18 percent of GDP, that holds them to not raising taxes without a supermajority, that is not some wild-eyed idea from economic theory,"" he says. ""That is spiritual principle that comes from the Bible, particularly from the book of Proverbs."" And how has the Johnson Amendment helped with that problem? ""How's that worked out for us in the last 58 years? How have our communities been doing, how has our nation been doing with pastors silenced in the pulpit?"" In Maryland, Harry Jackson devotes his sermon to ""reasons why I cannot vote for Barack Obama."" Chief among them: gay marriage. ""We can't say, as many people in the black community are saying today: He had to do this, to raise money! No. He didn't have to put that in the platform. ... He didn't have to make a show of putting the name of God back in the platform."" He simplifies the argument. ""You're against marriage? We're against you."" In other churches, congregations get a message that's both more terrifying and more generic. ""Our ruling elites hate the future,"" says Douglas Wilson at a church in Idaho. ""When they are not killing the citizens of the future, they are taxing the remainder into a staggering slavery. They hate it. They hate God and they hate the image of God. They hate the image of God and man, and that's why they attack the most innocent among us."" In Rio Rancho, I take a folding chair in the back of the chapel and sing along with some guitar-and-vocals devotionals. The service begins with a church elder affirming that America is ""going downhill, and going downhill, fast,"" before reading from Chronicles 7:11, Verse 14: ""If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land."" Hall takes the pulpit only briefly to tell us that his big sermon will come next week. We'll have to wait to hear who he's voting for. In the meantime, we'll hear from ""my lawyer,"" Joe Infranco. It's a star turn--Infranco is with the Alliance Defending Freedom (formerly the Alliance Defense Fund), and he's joined Hall on a tour of New Mexico churches, talking up pulpit freedom. Instead of endorsing a candidate, he'll describe how far a nation can fall--how much harm can be done to Christians--if the churches don't engage in political debate. He bemoans the ""Starbucks conversation,"" in which Christians are uncomfortable saying what they think to strangers. ""What happens when same-sex marriage comes is that if you're a traditional Christian, it becomes the wrong answer,"" he says. ""We're in a culture that prizes relativism. You want to be tolerant. It's the highest goal in the culture. But tolerance is not virtuous. Tolerating evil is not a great thing."" Infranco has examples. California may pass a law that bans ex-gay therapy, even as sex-change therapy is encouraged and covered by health insurance. A photographer in New Mexico is fighting off a lawsuit because she chose not to document a gay wedding. Eke Green, a Swedish pastor, is convicted of a hate crime for calling homosexuality an ""evil force"" and ""diabolical power."" (These are Green's words, not Infranco's.) It's happening because Christians don't fight back. Infranco describes what happens when he debates, and a student says that the Alliance is trying to ""force your morality"" on people. ""It gets thunderous applause, as if the words came down from Mount Sinai,"" he says. ""I'll just say things like: Let me explore what you're saying. If there's no absolute truth and no absolute right or wrong, I suppose you don't criticize Nazi Germany."" The point isn't to compare the Reich to Obama's America. The point is that the argument is so easy, and so winnable, if Christians buck the IRS and get into the game. After the sermon, a small group of parishioners stay and talk with Infranco. ""I just feel like we're in the minority now,"" says one of them, a middle-aged transplant from New York. ""The real discrimination in the culture is absolutely against a Christian who believes in the authority of the Bible,"" says Infranco. ""You go to California and say 'I've got a same-sex partner.' You'll be welcomed in politics. You can be president of a university. You go out and say, I supported Proposition 8, and your restaurant will be boycotted. You'll be fired from the university."" ""We better start jumpin' up and down a little more,"" says the parishioner."	What Happens When a Bunch of Preachers Decide To Get Political?	['Obama']	['god', 'gay']

A Pew Research Center poll released Monday showed Romney tied with Obama among female voters, 47-47. Just last month, Obama had an 18-point lead among female voters, with 56 percent of women supporting Obama and only 38 percent supporting Romney. But after the debate, Obama's favorability rating among women dropped 9 points. In mid-September, 60 percent of women had a favorable opinion of Obama, and after the debate, only 51 percent did. During the same time, Romney's favorability rating among women went up from 42 percent to 48 percent. Oddly, Romney gained support from female voters, even though neither candidate talked about women at all. See Mitt Romney's earlier rays of hope. See Barack Obama's earlier rays of hope.

That's well within the poll's margin of error, meaning the Badger State is once again a toss-up after months of polling blue. Republicans have taken note. Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell will be campaigning for Romney in Green Bay on Tuesday, while conservative super PAC Restore Our Future is spending $1.2 million on anti-Obama ads in the state this week. Romney's selection of Wisconsinite Paul Ryan as a running mate already gives him a slight advantage in a Democrat-leaning state, and the new poll numbers show that Wisconsin's 10 electoral votes are up for grabs.

11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/mitt_romney_foreign_policy_speech_at_the_virginia_military_institute_was_the_most_dishonest_one_he_has_delivered_yet_.html	"Mitt Romney has delivered a lot of dishonest speeches in recent months, but Monday's address on foreign policy may be the most mendacious yet. It was expected that he would distort President Obama into a caricature of Jimmy Carter. But it was astonishing to watch Romney spin a daydream of himself as some latter-day George Marshall, bringing peace, prosperity, and hope to a chaotic world--this from a man who couldn't drop in on the London Olympics without alienating our closest ally and turning himself into a transcontinental laughingstock. To the extent that Romney recited valid criticisms of Obama's policies, he offered no alternatives. To the extent he spelled out specific steps he would take to deal with one problem or another, he merely recited actions that Obama has already taken. Let's go through the text, point by point. Romney began with the recent attacks on the Libyan consulate, the killing of the U.S. ambassador, and the anti-American riots that broke out across the Middle East--all signs, he claimed, that ""the threats we face have grown so much worse"" while President Obama does nothing. Let's pause here. First, these threats are not worsening; in fact, the number of attacks on U.S. embassies is near an all-time low. Second, the spate of attacks, riots, and American flag-burnings, which followed the attacks in Libya and Egypt, ended almost immediately. Romney himself, after recounting the grim events, noted that we're now seeing ""something hopeful""--protests by ""tens of thousands of Libyans"" against the militants and in support of the American ambassador. Yet Romney ignored the reasons why the riots subsided and why the Libyan people went after the militants. These things happened because President Obama had supported the Libyan rebels in their resistance to Muammar Qaddafi--and because, after the storming of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, Obama had a long phone conversation with Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, spelling out the facts of life: that Morsi had to choose between siding with the Islamist militants (who formed part of his constituency) and rejoining the civilized world. Romney repeatedly bemoaned Obama's passivity, but one can only ask: What is he talking about? Later in the speech, Romney criticized Obama for ""missing an historic opportunity to win new friends who share our values in the Middle East."" It's unclear whether, or to what extent, even the protesters in Benghazi ""share our values,"" but it is clear that Obama's actions have made them friends--which is why they took to the streets against the militants. Romney then turned to the topic near and dear to the voters of Florida in particular. ""The relationship between the president of the United States and the prime minister of Israel, our closest ally in the region, has suffered great strains,"" he said, adding that they have ""set back the hopes of peace in the Middle East and emboldened our mutual adversaries."" First, yes, there are strains in Obama's relationship with Netanyahu--but they're no more severe than the strains in Netanyahu's relationship with his own military establishment. Israel's defense minister, Ehud Barack, said in a CNN interview two months ago, ""This administration under President Obama is doing, in regard to our security, more than anything that I can remember in the past."" Many Israeli security officials think Netanyahu has gone way too far in his pressure on Obama. An American politician can support Israel's security without supporting the Israeli prime minister in his own domestic quarrels--much less agreeing with everything he says. ""In Iraq,"" Romney claimed, ""the costly gains made by our troops are being eroded by rising violence."" This is true. But then he said, ""America's ability to influence events for the better in Iraq has been undermined by the abrupt withdrawal of our entire troop presence,"" adding that Obama tried to secure a more gradual drawdown but ""failed."" The facts are these. First, President George W. Bush signed an agreement with the Iraqi government in November 2008 stating, ""All U.S. forces are to withdraw from all Iraqi territory, water, and airspace no later than the 31st of December of 2011."" Second, as the deadline neared, Obama did explore options to keep some of those troops in Iraq for a while longer--but Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki did not want them to stay. Iraq was, and is, a sovereign nation. If Romney thinks he could have negotiated a deal to stay, he doesn't say what it would have been. He can't, because there was no such deal anywhere near the table. Then came a gratuitously outrageous statement. ""America,"" Romney said, ""can take pride in the blows that our military and intelligence professionals have inflicted on al-Qaida in Pakistan and Afghanistan, including the killing of Osama bin Laden."" (Italics added.) Really? President Obama deserves no credit for dealing these blows? Obama has personally ordered many of these blows (as some in his own party have complained), and, as is well known, he ordered the raid on bin Laden's compound against the advice of Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, who thought it was too risky. Romney followed this with the most stupefying attack in the entire speech, worth quoting at some length: I will put the leaders of Iran on notice that the United States and our friends and allies will prevent them from acquiring nuclear weapons capability. I will not hesitate to impose new sanctions on Iran and will tighten the sanctions we currently have. I will restore the permanent presence of aircraft carrier task forces in both the Eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf region--and work with Israel to increase our military assistance and coordination. For the sake of peace, we must make clear to Iran through actions, not just words, that their nuclear pursuit will not be tolerated. Obama has long been doing all of these things. He has ratcheted up sanctions and persuaded others (including Russia) to go along, to the point where Iran's currency has plummeted by 40 percent, prompting the merchant class to protest in the streets. Two aircraft carriers have been on constant patrol within range of Iran since the summer. And U.S. security assistance to Israel, as its own defense minister said, is at near-peak levels. Romney then pledged to boost defense spending, saying, ""I will roll back President Obama's deep and arbitrary cuts to our national defense that would devastate our military."" He also claimed that the ""size of our Navy is at levels not seen since 1916."" Both statements are highly misleading. First, these ""deep and arbitrary cuts"" in the defense budget (he also calls them ""catastrophic"") will go into effect only if Congress cannot agree on a deficit-reduction plan. Last year, Congress agreed that if they couldn't devise such a plan by the end of 2012, the entire federal budget--including defense--would be cut across the board. (Romney's running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, voted in favor of this pact.) Obama's actual, existing military budget for next year--which amounts to $525 billion, plus $88 billion for overseas operations (in Afghanistan and elsewhere)--is only 1 percent below this year's budget. As for the Navy, a single modern aircraft carrier has enough firepower onboard to destroy 1,000 targets with impressive accuracy. To compare the might, range, and speed of today's vessels with those of 1916 is absurd--and an insult to the Navy. Romney neglected to note that his own budget plan calls for adding $2 trillion to military spending over the next 10 years. He may have sidestepped this fact--even though it might have appealed to his audience of cadets at the Virginia Military Institute--because, time and again, he has declined to specify how he will pay such a whopping bill. Nor has he specified why such increases are necessary: for what contingencies, against what enemies. On foreign aid, Romney said, ""I will make it clear to the recipients of our aid that, in return for our material support, they must meet the responsibilities of every decent modern government,"" including the protection of rights for women and minorities, free media, and an independent judiciary. He seems not to realize that the United States hands out aid to promote U.S. interests, not just the recipient's needs, and that our own leverage has limits: If an allied government doesn't want to make this deal, it can go elsewhere. Romney's line on Syria was very delicately phrased: ""I will work with our partners to identify and organize those members of the opposition who share our values and ensure they obtain the arms they need to defeat Assad's tanks, helicopters, and fighter jets."" (Italics added.) First, and again, it's unclear any of the rebels ""share our values."" Second, it's unclear whether, once the good guys among the rebels (a.k.a. the non-Islamists) get these heavy arms, they won't share them with their Islamist brothers. Third, he left unclear where the rebels will ""obtain"" these heavy arms. More to the point, he didn't say that he would provide them. So what would he do that Obama hasn't? He didn't say, perhaps because he doesn't know. On Afghanistan, Romney seemed simply muddled. First, he said, ""I will pursue a real and successful transition to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014."" Then he denounced Obama's ""politically timed retreat that abandons the Afghan people to the same extremists who ravaged their country."" But Obama's policy also calls for pursuing a transition to the Afghan forces by the end of 2014. In fact, this is official NATO policy--and a policy that Afghan President Hamid Karzai supports, even demands. So what would Romney do differently? Then Romney restated his main theme: ""There is a longing for American leadership."" Everywhere, ""the question is asked: 'Where does America stand?' "" He especially raised concerns about Asia, where ""China's recent assertiveness is sending chills through the region."" Again, one wonders what world Romney is watching. In Asia, Obama has responded, even taken the initiative, renewing security arrangements with Japan, sending Marines to Australia, stepping up joint naval patrols, challenging Beijing's claims in the South China Sea, while also seeking cooperative forums with the Chinese military. The defense analyst Robert Kaplan (no relation), one of the first to warn of Chinese ambitions, said at a panel sponsored by the New America Foundation that the Obama administration was doing pretty much all that needed to be done--both in its activities and in its shipbuilding program. Finally, Romney proclaimed, ""The 21st century can and must be an American century."" This is where he and his advisers, many of them Bush-Cheney neo-cons, share a dangerous assumption about the world. They seem to believe that the United States can wield the same force and influence it did during the Cold War, if only a strong president sat in the White House again. Yet the rise of American power after World War II was facilitated by the geopolitics of the day: a bipolar international system, a faceoff between the United States and the Soviet Union, with much of the rest of the world choosing, or falling into, one camp or the other. When the Cold War ended and the Soviet Union imploded, this international system collapsed as well--and, as yet, nothing has taken its place. Power has dispersed as power-centers have weakened. As he has on other occasions, Romney asserted that a president must ""use America's great power to shape history,"" not to let events shape America. But the fact is there are no superpowers in today's world; no country has as much power to shape history--or as little immunity to the influences of others--as America did in the Cold War era. To exercise true leadership, a president must come to grips with the limits of his or her power. This has nothing to do with notions of ""American decline."" It has to do with the shattering of the Cold War world. Romney is right that, in some cases, most notably Syria, Obama has not done as much as he might have to influence the course of events. However, there is almost nothing in Romney's speech to suggest that he would do better--and a great deal to indicate he'd do much worse."	Mitt Romney's Most Dishonest Speech	['Paul', 'Romney', 'Israel', 'Obama']	[]
12	12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/mitt_romney_has_moved_from_being_the_conservative_gop_primary_winner_to_a_far_more_moderate_former_governor_of_massachusetts_.html	"Three weeks ago Mitt Romney was confronted with a secretly recorded video in which he dismissed President Obama's supporters--the now famous 47 percent--as congenital moochers who were addicted to government because they took no personal responsibility for themselves. Now he disavows the remarks. ""I was completely wrong,"" he told Fox News on Thursday. So, in the wake of his impressive debate performance and barely a month before the election, undecided voters are asked to play another round of ""Where's Willard?""  Is Mitt Romney the man in that secret video, who thinks ill of almost half the country he hopes to govern? Or is he the man we met in Colorado, an agile master of facts, policies, and economics who seems perfectly personable and maybe even friendly? Or is he someone else altogether? The president's aides say, ""Look at the secret video! There he is!"" They want you to find the real Romney among the chafing dishes, clinking cutlery, and pricey suits. (A new Obama video says ""He said it, he meant it."") Don't be fooled by the man on the debate stage, they say. That's just a mask. To make this case, the president must rely on a conceit that often gets applied to him. Conservatives have argued since 2004 that Obama's essential liberal desires are always roiling beneath a careful facade. These Republicans sit at the border on night watch, waiting for the moment when a window opens exposing Obama's inner radical. When they see it, they sound the alarm. Last week, that meant pointing to a video of Obama alternating the intonation of his voice during a speech in front of a predominantly black audience in 2007. Romney's allies argue that the debate, not the video, revealed the real man. ""He has finally shed the duct tape of the primaries,"" says GOP strategist Mike Murphy of Romney's debate performance. Romney took the stage more like the man who won the governorship in the blue state of Massachusetts than the man who won the GOP nomination. But finding the essential Romney isn't so simple. The experiment itself is flawed. Voters are being asked to detect the truth from two different acts of artifice. One is a set-piece performance recorded by the television networks. The other was a set-piece performance captured by a member of the catering staff. Both are performances. Like all politicians, Romney was playing to the crowd in both cases. The question is not which one represents the true Romney, but which crowd will he play to when he's in office. The essential character of Mitt Romney matters because we can never have a policy debate detailed enough to see exactly how his values will play out when the hard choices need to be made. Both candidates agree that the federal government must be rebalanced between the services people expect and the taxes they are willing to pay for those services. So who do you trust? We can certainly try to look at policies. In the debate, Romney and Obama traded accusations about their Medicare ideas. Romney believes the free market can lower costs and retain quality. President Obama believes that costs can be cut through government nudges of the free market. How do we know who has the better policy? We can look at studies and try to follow their reasoning. Sometimes there aren't enough studies or the candidates don't want to answer our follow-up questions. With Mitt Romney, in particular, on the questions of taxes and Medicare, his goals are so grand as to be either fantastical or untestable. If they don't work out as planned, his aides say, he'll tweak them.  So even when we want to talk about policy, we find ourselves circling back to the same place: Trust me. Since President Obama has been in office we've seen how ""trust me"" works in practice. Voters can make their own individual assessment of whether President Obama has kept their trust or not. They don't have to look for secret windows into his soul. But with Mitt Romney it's not so easy. It would be nice if we could force the challenger to offer a budget as a qualification for running for president (perhaps the Commission on Presidential Debates could get on that?), but until we do, the essential question is how will Mitt Romney behave when he's staring at the hard choices in the Oval Office. Will he be a moderate of the center-right as he appeared to be on the debate stage or will he be the ruthless realist of that video? It depends on which Willard Mitt Romney shows up."

As one of the fastest growing demographics in the country, Hispanics hold increasing electoral clout, particularly in battleground states. Obama has consistently courted their support by promoting the DREAM Act and issuing an executive order allowing many undocumented students to remain in the United States.

Orrin Hatch tried to be nice, he really did. The senator took the Crowne Plaza stage at the post-debate Conservative Political Action Conference, and asked his audience to indulge one backhanded compliment of President Barack Obama. ""The president is a charming man, no question,"" said Hatch. ""But, he looked on the defensive ..."" Hearty boos and ha-ha-has filled the room. ""No, wait, wait!"" said Hatch. ""Well, let me put it another way."" Boooo! ""He's a very likeable man, but let me just say ..."" Booo! ""Well, let me put it another way. The president's a very smart guy, no question ..."" Booo! ""What you saw last night is that the president's a very smart guy as long as he's using teleprompters."" That did it. Hatch's audience practically levitated with glee--one of three references to teleprompters that they'd hear from three politicians in 45 minutes. Sen. Marco Rubio arrived onstage, saw a teleprompter, and stagily pushed it aside. ""What a difference 90 minutes without a teleprompter makes!"" said former Rep. Artur Davis, an old Obama ally who lost a Democratic primary for governor in Alabama in 2010 and slowly turned into a Republican. ""No teleprompter, just two men and their thoughts. "" Finally, finally, after four long years, somebody had proved that Barack Obama was a talking point wrapped up in a suit. For the first time, the Republican base had a reason to love Mitt Romney. Not tolerate. Not mutter about how he ""wasn't my first choice."" Today, they loved the guy like he'd stopped to fix their car then paid off their mortgages. Here's the odd thing: He did it by being the Mitt Romney that conservatives always said they didn't like. It was the first time in 10 years he'd had to debate a Democrat, not some conservative who could run to his right. So he snuck around the president and flanked him from the left. ""There will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit,"" said Romney, as he discussed plans to cut taxes and add to the deficit. ""I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit."" On health care, the issue that dragged out the primaries more than any other, Romney took full ownership of the Massachusetts mandate. ""I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together,"" he explained. And he promised to restore $716 billion of funding to Medicare--four times. Did President Obama expect to meet this version of Mitt Romney? The stiff who'd told a February CPAC that he'd been a ""severely conservative"" governor was replaced by the list-making guy who actually won in Massachusetts. Up to now, every time Romney has walked off the reservation--when an aide has failed to say that President Romney would burn Obamacare page by page--conservatives have erupted. And then Romney humiliated Obama in a debate. All is forgiven. ""Honestly, Mitt Romney could say anything and I'd say 'Right on!' "" said Sister Mary Nelle, a Catholic nun from Lakewood, Col. Back in February she had caucused for Newt Gingrich, against Romney; she wore a Rick Santorum sticker, honoring the guy who'd beaten Romney in those caucuses. ""But I would take almost any alternative to the current officeholder."" This was what Republicans were talking about months ago when they nominated Romney. He was ""electable."" When they admitted that to exit pollsters, they were expecting a candidate who came off as moderate to win where, say, Rick Santorum couldn't. ""I was hearing a little bit of angst last night,"" said Larry O'Connor, a radio host and editor of Breitbart.tv. ""Like, 'Hang on, did Romney just say that regulation was necessary?' But people have moved off of that today."" Thus, the teleprompter jokes. Conservatives have always looked at Barack Obama as a flimsy creation of a biased media. The day before the debate, the conservative media obsessed over a 2007 video of the president speaking at a historically black college and  talking about the role of race in the government's response to Hurricane Katrina. That speech had been covered by the ""drive-by media,"" as Rush Limbaugh calls it. But according to conservatives, the media had ignored Obama's racialism in order to protect him. They pass around clips of Obama saying he's visited ""57 states"" and mangling health care answers to point out that the guy is useless without a teleprompter. The day after the debate, they thanked Romney for proving them right. ""I was surprised at how poorly the president did,"" said Richard Land, head of the social conservative Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, after wrapping up a panel on the Obama administration's contraceptive mandate. ""I was a little stunned. He looked like a deer in the headlights."" Romney had been conservative enough for him. ""He was attempting to be moderate in tone, but he was talking about defunding PBS, defunding Obamacare."" But why did the president underperform? Land pointed at my chest as he answered. ""The guy lives in cocoon of yes-men,"" he said. ""When he goes into one of his infrequent press conferences, people in your profession might as well bow down, because they never ask him tough questions."" A CPAC-goer chimed in--""Yes! Yes!""--then walked on. It didn't matter if Romney had sounded a few moderate notes. He exposed Barack Obama. For that, for the first time, all Republicans were proud of their nominee. Shortly after Rubio spoke, four of Romney's sons appeared on the CPAC stage. The eldest, Tagg Romney, announced that another family member had arrived. Out came Mitt Romney, getting a 50-second long standing ovation. ""Last night, I thought, was a great opportunity for the American people to see two very different visions for the country,"" said Romney. As Romney spoke, not a single person sat down. The teleprompters stayed on the stage. He ignored them."	Republicans Suddenly Love Romney--Even if He Sounds Like a Moderate	['Rush', 'Obama', 'Romney', 'Rubio', 'Hatch']	['creation']

A keen but muted Ryan couldn't match all that personality. But did he have to? The latest Slate/SurveyMonkey snap poll gauges what viewers thought of each candidate's performance--and assesses whether any of it will matter in November. We posted our questions as soon as the debate finished and gathered responses until 9 a.m. Eastern this morning. (Information on respondents is available here. More information about SurveyMonkey Audience is here.) Our first survey question got straight to the point: ""Who do you think won the debate, Paul Ryan or Joe Biden?"" Biden emerged as the clear victor, capturing 48 percent of the vote to his opponent's 29.1 percent. Just under 13 percent declared the showdown a tie, and 10.3 percent weren't sure. Overall, survey takers found Uncle Joe slightly more convincing than the polite but pointed Ryan. A plurality of 29.3 percent pronounced Biden ""very effective,"" 27.4 percent called him ""somewhat effective,"" and 20.1 chose ""extremely effective."" Meanwhile, 26.3 percent of viewers rated the GOP running mate ""very effective,"" another 26.3 termed him ""somewhat effective,"" and a slim 10.6 percent gave him the ""extremely effective"" score. Low expectations seem to have offered the vice president a boost. ""Did Joe Biden perform better or worse in the debate than you expected?"" we asked. And here Biden's reputation as a gaffe-prone motormouth may have come into play: A combined 42 percent of survey takers were surprised by how well Biden performed. Just under 31 percent reported that the veep fulfilled their predictions, and around 17 percent said he disappointed them. Ryan, on the other hand, delivered a solid showing--not stellar but good all the same. The largest group of respondents, 43 percent, said he basically conformed to their expectations, neither overwhelming the floor with policy brilliance nor making Martha Raddatz wince. Around 37 percent deemed Ryan better than they thought he'd be. Just over one-fifth described him as worse. But, as we mentioned earlier, a gratifying night for the left doesn't always translate into a bad night for the right, no matter how good it feels. When we filtered our results to isolate undecided voters, we saw very little movement in either direction. For starters, a majority of the bet-hedging respondents--56.3 percent--could not even say whether Ryan or Biden had won the debate. Furthermore, when we asked, ""Based on Joe Biden's debate performance tonight, were you persuaded to vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden?"" only 1 percent of our fence-sitting survey takers said yes. Ryan hardly fared better: Just 4 percent of undecided voters claimed he had pushed them closer to casting a Republican ballot. Joe Biden took his supporters on an exhilarating ride last night, but in the places it matters, the election is still in gridlock."	Did Joe Biden Come to Obama's Rescue?	['Paul', 'Obama']	[]

The 2012 debate season began with a lay-up, a Mitt Romney victory that shattered every record in the history of snap polling. Style. Crispness of answers. Eye contact. Their candidate had every advantage that the focus groups crave. Then came Joe Biden. Imagine you're a liberal, and think of all the lines you wanted Barack Obama to use against Mitt Romney. There you go. Now: Did Biden forget any of them? Or did he pull a San Diego Fourth of July fireworks display and spray them all at once? ""The congressman here cut embassy security in his budget by $300 million below what we asked for."" The sequester ""was part of a debt deal that they asked for."" ""In the past he has argued that there's rape and forcible rape."" Liberals and conservatives respond to identical events, identical setbacks to their sides, in precisely opposite ways. Conservatives wonder if the data is skewed. Democrats just know that they're screwed. After Obama failed them, liberals spent a long holiday weekend discussing just how badly he'd failed. They called into NPR to talk about why he'd failed. They blogged at Daily Kos about why he'd failed. Biden calmed them. For at least 45 minutes he laughed at everything Ryan said--a pitying, who-is-this-schmuck laugh. The first credible Republican spin I heard in Danville: Well, you know, that's good for him, but not really good enough. ""We had the momentum coming into this debate,"" said Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. ""We still have the momentum. That means it was a bad night for the Democrats."" Democrats separated the night from the ""momentum"" talk. Obama's campaign manager Jim Messina confidently told reporters that Obama was on ""the path to 270 electoral votes,"" and rumors of swing-state slippage could not be trusted, and anyway what about that Biden? ""You saw the vice president be a happy warrior out there,"" he said, ""fighting for the middle class against talking points."" In my short time in the Messina scrum, he made the ""happy warrior"" reference--a  callback to Hubert Humphrey--twice. The Democrats' pride carried a whiff of wistfulness. ""We could all learn a lesson, all of us, from Joe Biden's debate performance tonight,"" said Sen. Dick Durbin. ""Come in with passion and conviction and don't allow your opponent to dance away."" I'd seen these Biden tricks when I watched videos of his old debate performances. The 2008 debate with Sarah Palin was a fluke--Biden couldn't afford to be so pugnacious that it turned women off. Biden applied overwhelming force to Ryan, refusing to let him make a point without rebutting it, either in real time or a few seconds later. This became the first piece of the GOP's two-part fight back. Biden was too rough, not serious enough. ""When the vice president kept interrupting throughout the 90 minutes, I think there should have been pushback,"" said Rep. Jason Chaffetz. ""That's what the moderator's there to do."" An hour after the debate ended, the Republican National Committee released a super-cut of every Biden laugh, claiming that he was ""laughing at the issues,"" not deriding Ryan. Republicans have enjoyed plenty of success by clipping the worst parts of quotes and sending them to media. Maybe it could work again! The second GOP counterattack was less pathetic. After moderator Martha Raddatz kept asking Biden for answers on Libya, and why four Americans had been killed in an attack on the Benghazi consulate, Biden claimed that ""we weren't told they wanted more security. We did not know they wanted more security there."" In most debates, Biden's able to expectorate a line like that and get away with it. In real time, Ryan let him get away with it. (Ryan had very few real-time rejoinders that Biden couldn't turn around and stampede.) I heard it from Chaffetz first. ""It was shocking to think that the vice president doesn't know that assets were requested in Libya,"" said the congressman, who knew it because his House Oversight Committee had just held a hearing where diplomats talked about the needs. Rich Williamson, a former Bush ambassador whom the Romney campaign deploys to bemoan Obama's horrible weakness, suggested that Biden had birthed a scandal. ""If Joe Biden's position's right,"" he said, ""the question is not only why did they fail to give security that was requested by professionals, but what did they know for two weeks?"" Dan Senor, who's graduated from spokesman for the occupation in Iraq to Ryan's national security tutor, insisted that ""the last few weeks have seen the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy."" So the Romney campaign was finishing the day the way it started it--demanding that the Obama administration answer questions about the consulate attacks, looking for ways to trip them up. Paul Ryan got out of the way and made no news. The campaign was back in the hands of the spinners."

19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/vice_presidential_debate_joe_biden_and_paul_ryan_need_to_avoid_confirming.html	"Joe Biden has said that the hardest thing about becoming a vice presidential candidate was that he had to learn how to speak for someone else. It's been pretty hard on Barack Obama, too--because sometimes it seems Biden is speaking for Mitt Romney. From his comments about chaining black voters to his suggestion that the middle class has been ""buried,"" Biden has helped the Romney camp enough that he at least deserves a Romney-Ryan campaign fleece. Paul Ryan has had an easier time sublimating himself to his boss's agenda. Though he is new to the crucible of a national campaign, he has not caused Romney a single headache. When his positions have come into conflict with Romney's on the hot-button issues of Social Security, Medicare, and abortion, Ryan has fallen in line. He has made the transition from policy wonk to attack dog nicely, as demonstrated by his speech at the Republican National Convention. He has only one more hurdle left, and if he clears it Thursday night, he will either be the vice president or the front-runner in 2016. Most of us who follow politics say the vice presidential debate is meaningless. Voters base their votes on the name at the top of the campaign sign. That is true. But in this campaign, where merely the clumsy repetition of a months-old talking point can control a few news cycles, surely the debate performance of the fellow who is one heartbeat away from the presidency has the potential to shake things up. If nothing else, the debate will provide us with language and moments to discuss the existing themes of this election. Here's how either Ryan or Biden may affect the race (and thereby gain a place in vice presidential debate history): if they commit a confirming blunder. What is this particular species of gaffe? In the veep debate, I'd define it as a statement or action that underlines the most negative stereotype about the top candidate. Of course, we have been told that this campaign is rife with blunders, gaffes, and missteps. So what is not a confirming blunder? Big Bird, for starters. In the first debate, Mitt Romney made a joke that Big Bird would lose federal funding if Romney becomes president. President Obama says Romney's priorities are misplaced. He doesn't care about hurting kids, and the amount he would save by firing Big Bird is minuscule--which really goes to show you how much he is not telling us about what he plans to cut. Romney uses Big Bird on the stump, too. The president wants to protect Big Bird, he says; I want to protect American families. The tweet-a-tweet over the Sesame Street character confirms nothing but the pre-existing views of both sides. A confirming blunder is one a campaign can't battle back from so easily. A good example was Romney's secretly videotaped comments about the layabouts, chiselers, and moochers in the 47 percent voting for Obama. It underlined the narrative that he doesn't care about half the country. For Obama, the confirming blunder was his ""You didn't build that"" remarks, which cast small business owners as uppity entrepreneurs who thought too much of their own achievements. In the aftermath of the first presidential debate, the storylines are clear. The Romney team had hoped to paint President Obama as tired and out of ideas. Focus groups conducted for the Romney campaign show that those who voted for Obama in 2008 but are disappointed in his performance are worried that he's out of ideas. (Focus groups run by the conservative group Crossroads GPS detects the same thing, which is why their new anti-Obama ad is titled ""Out of ideas."") In the debate, Obama not only fit that mold with his responses, he underlined it with his listless demeanor. It's a special achievement when the messenger can also be the message. If Biden reinforces the limited, earthbound and listless image of the administration, it will be remembered. Romney emerged from the first debate with plaudits but also questions. He emphasized the moderate tenets of his views on education, Medicare, and tax cuts. The Obama team is arguing that the man who once described himself as ""severely conservative"" is trying to hide his true colors to woo enough undecided voters to his side. They argue his core is still ""severely conservative."" (Never mind that they once said he doesn't have a core.) How will the vice presidential candidates confirm these storylines? That's the fun of watching. A simple Bidenism won't do it alone--the market has already discounted for that--but then again that market discount may be the problem. People are used to the Biden gaffes, which means they may also be tired of them. If Biden conforms to his own stereotype--loquacious and off point--it may reinforce the notion that the campaign is tired and out of ideas more than anything else. Ryan is the embodiment of Romney's conservatism. Ryan actually is severely conservative--he was a member of the GOP's Young Guns in the House--an aggressive group of no-compromise conservatives. Right now Romney is boasting about working with Democrats (swing voting women like that) and emphasizing the moderate aspects of his conservatism. Ryan doesn't fit that mold and might find it hard to know exactly what to emphasize to stay in line with the nuances of his boss. A slip up could bolster the Obama argument that this team is not being honest. Republicans don't just laugh at Biden's blunders. They say it makes him unfit. Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the vice president is mentally unstable. Democrats claim Ryan bends the truth. Biden's flaw is that he lets the truth slip unintentionally. Ryan never lets a truth slip--intentionally. This battle of two different philosophies, by two intelligent men from different generations could touch on a host of serious themes. That is, if these two partisan storylines don't overtake things and make the undercard sound more like a World Wrestling match: Sir Gaffe-a-Lot vs. Lyin' Ryan."

24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/will_republicans_accept_if_barack_obama_defeats_mitt_romney_.html	"What if President Obama wins re-election and Republicans don't believe it? The question isn't far-fetched. For several weeks, we have seen Republicans challenge the veracity of a number of election-related facts, and the outcome of the presidential election may be no different. First, some Republicans claimed that public opinion polls were all skewed to show an Obama lead. As Slate reported, 71 percent of self-identified Republicans and 84 percent of Tea Partiers believe in the skew. Republicans confidently claim that the polls are oversampling Democrats, not realizing that these are self-reported party identifications, which rise and fall with candidates' support. Distrust of the polls is not a new phenomenon, and it is not confined to Republicans. As Nate Silver pointed out, when Democrats were behind in 2004 they believed the polls were skewed toward Republicans. Fortunately, the Romney debate performance last week apparently was enough to ""unskew"" the latest numbers. Last week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics issued a relatively rosy jobs report, which not only reported better-than-expected hiring for September but also upward revisions for earlier months. Soon thereafter, a number of Republicans, including former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, questioned whether or not the numbers were accurate. Welch tweeted: ""Unbelievable jobs numbers ... these Chicago guys will do anything ... can't debate so change number.""  What evidence did Welch have? Nada. This week features what conservative blogs are touting as an ""explosive"" new report suggesting that the Obama campaign is illegally accepting massive foreign contributions via credit card. The so-called proof comes from a number of foreign visits to the Obama campaign website, the lack of any federal requirement to publicly disclose contributions from individuals who give less than $200 overall, and the Obama campaign's supposed failure to use credit card verification tools to make sure the contributions are coming from inside the United States. Never mind that the Obama campaign has denied similar reports in the past and has confirmed it does use the verification tools; that an extensive Federal Election Commission audit of the 2008 Obama campaign found no evidence of illegal foreign contributions; that foreign visits to the website does not mean that foreign contributions are being made; and that U.S. citizens (including those in the military) living abroad have the right to contribute to federal campaigns. The claims are a way to delegitimize the Obama campaign, even as Republican leaders in Congress stymie efforts to fix our broken disclosure laws and argue for less disclosure of campaign finance information. All of these conspiracy theories--like the earlier birther controversies--indicate that if we are unlucky enough to have a very close election in November in which President Obama ekes out a victory, we can expect Republicans to question the election results, too. We'll have the Fraudulent Fraud Squad telling us that Democrats used voter fraud to steal the election. Hucksters like John Fund will point to ""bizarre"" anomalies in vote totals from Democratic areas and tout new conspiracy theories. Social media will likely fan the flames. Unfortunately, as I argue in The Voting Wars, we run our elections so badly that there will be plenty of things for Republicans to complain about: partisan election officials, broken voting machines, unclear rules and controversial court decisions, inconsistencies between voter registration totals, exit polls, and the final voting tally. Now the cause of many election problems almost certainly will be incompetence and not malfeasance, but that's a hard argument to sell to people on the wrong end of a close election. Since 2000, public opinion on the fairness of elections is volatile. In 1996, before the 2000 Florida meltdown ending with the Supreme Court's decision in Bush v. Gore, about 10 percent of people believed the way the election was run was somewhat or very unfair, with almost no difference in Republican views and Democratic views. By 2004, when George W. Bush won re-election over John Kerry, roughly 22 percent of Democrats thought the way the election was run was unfair compared with about 3 percent of Republicans. Yet in the contested Washington state election in 2004, when the courts handed the governorship to a Democrat after a Republican was first declared the winner, 68 percent of Republicans compared with only 27 percent of Democrats thought the way the election was run was unfair. The lesson from these statistics is simple. If my guy won, the election was fair and square. If your guy won, there must have been some kind of chicanery. This campaign season, Republicans seem more apt to buy the conspiracy theories than Democrats. Maybe it is because Romney has generally been behind in the polls. Maybe Democrats will start getting paranoid if Romney's new lead sticks. There was certainly paranoia from Democrats in 2004 (rebutted by a report issued by Rep. John Conyers) that Republicans stole the election in Ohio. We'll have to wait and see. But at this point I'm more concerned about Republicans not buying the final outcome than Democrats. If Obama wins a second term, polarization and partisanship will only get worse if Republicans do not believe Obama legitimately won re-election. It is reminiscent of pre-9/11 Democrats' views of the legitimacy of George Bush's presidency. If you think politics is ugly now and that the truth has been a casualty in the campaign, just wait for November. If it is another squeaker, the election truthers will be front and center."

Ninety-eight percent of those contributions consisted of $250 or less, and only 16 percent of Obama's donor base has maxed out its contribution limit this cycle. (Compare that to Romney's donors, of whom more than half have already reached their limit.) Meanwhile, conservative super PACs are largely shifting their fundraising away from the presidential campaign and toward Senate races. The new haul leaves Obama with a massive war chest to draw from as he defends his narrow lead over the next month, and his fundraising pace shows no sign of slackening. For all the Democratic panic over Citizens United and super PACs, Obama and the Democrats may outspend Republicans in 2012. See Barack Obama's earlier rays of hope.

Eliason, 67, holds an iPad in a black and red rubber case, and on her arm she keeps a purse full of ""lit."" She's a canvasser for Working America, the AFL-CIO's outreach appendage.* She gets $11.67 per hour to walk precincts. Tonight, she will help prove that New Mexico is no longer a swing state. ""We're not actually asking questions about the president,"" says Eliason. Working America's walkers are given short ""raps,"" just a few questions that can be answered in less than a minute if a subject isn't chatty. She walks her path of gated homes, Kias, Nissans, and Fords in the driveways, and meets the potential Democratic vote. The red-shirted door-steppers of Working America had been asking whether voters supported President Obama, whether they supported Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Martin Heinrich, whether they backed the Democrats' state House candidate, and whether they'd vote for a city minimum-wage hike. (Santa Fe, they point out, has a minimum wage $3 higher than Albuquerque's $7.15.) A problem emerged. Too many people, about two-thirds, supported Obama. The question got the labor group no closer to identifying voters. Sometimes, as Eliason goes through her ""rap,"" the conversation drifts to Obama. Three times out of three dozen, she meets real anti-Obama sentiment. Anyone who's still on the fence--middle-aged and elderly whites, Hispanics--is still with Obama. One retiree, Evelyn Lopez, is rattled by the president's ""confused"" demeanor in the first debate, but ""I don't think Romney knows about people like me,"" so he's still nixed. And this is the Romney campaign's dilemma. For generations, New Mexico had been a swing state that Republicans carry when they win and keep close when they don't. Native Americans and Santa Fe liberals battled for supremacy with the conservative whites and Hispanics of the ranches and energy boomtowns. Albuquerque and its suburbs would be fought to a draw. So Al Gore carried the state by 366 votes, a win that took four weeks for the state to confirm. Four years later, George W. Bush carried New Mexico with 5,982. And for a while, it looked like the race between Barack Obama and Arizona transplant John McCain would be fairly close. The final polling suggested a 7-point Obama win. He ultimately won by 15 points, becoming the first Democrat to win a majority of New Mexico votes since Lyndon Johnson 44 years earlier. John Kerry had won Albuquerque's Bernalillo County by 4 points; Obama carried it by 21 points. Romney's polling even worse than McCain did. The GOP nominee is not playing for this state, ceding electoral votes won by Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and the Bushes. Nobody covers up the reasons for the swing. Republicans admit it: They alienated Hispanic voters and they paid for it. ""The reason that a lot of Hispanic independents and conservatives are so uncommitted is because the tone coming out of the [Republican primary] debates was so strident,"" says Rep. Steve Pearce, who represents basically all of New Mexico south of Albuquerque. ""They all got painted a bad picture. I've spent a long time with the Romney campaign on Hispanic and immigration issues. It was us who suggested that you ought to go onto Univision and speak to Hispanic audiences. And his tone was a lot softer. We get the tone right, and we'd be OK."" But it's a struggle. ""I love the Tea Party, but they're hitting the gas on this issue."" You can't do things like that in a state where whites are the minority. In 2000, according to the Census, New Mexico was 42.1 percent Hispanic and 9.5 percent Native American. In 2010, after a decade in which this state grew faster than the national average, the numbers rose to 46.7 percent Hispanic and 10.1 percent Native American. Here, as in Texas, there are conservative Hispanics who can trace their roots back 12 or more generations, and who Republicans can win. But they've made it harder. That big Native American vote gives them no room for error. When day breaks on Saturday I arrive at Shiprock, in northwestern New Mexico.* The 101st annual Najavo Nation celebration is peaking with a parade down the one four-lane highway that connects conservative Farmington to the reservations. Teens walk around in AC/DC and Misfits shirts; vendors with and without itinerant food-sale papers tote carriages or put up grills to sell frybread, spam breakfast burritos, and Pepsi. Before I'd left, some new friends in Albuquerque reeled at the idea of a night drive, telling me I was ""taking my life in my hands."" This lessens my surprise at the story leading on A1 of the local paper: ""Eight-time offender's ninth DWI didn't stick."" This is how poverty becomes cliche, and this an electorate that counts on government help. The Democrats, who got 79 percent of their vote in 2008, press the advantage by swarming the parade. Rep. Heinrich, the Senate candidate, tossed plastic-wrapped popcorn balls as he moves down the route. Sen. Tom Udall and Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, who already represent this area, help introduce him to the crowd. Henrich stops and talks to a Najavo on the parade route, Grace Egay, who works at the local hospital. ""I'm voting for Martin and for Obama,"" says Egay. ""Obama is for the Native American Indians. Romney doesn't say anything for the Native American Indians. I say we deserve to be helped. Our land was taken over by Europeans and we didn't get any, any kind of reward back. Even our health and education was cut down."" Heinrich reaches the end of the parade route, and as he thanks his volunteers I ask him whether Mitt Romney's assessment of the electorate--that 47 percent of people are too dependent to break from their party--gets any ballast here. ""You have serious needs for better water infrastructure, better roads,"" says Heinrich. You can't create the economic development you need unless you have those things first. People here know that even if they're not paying federal income taxes, they're paying their payroll taxes, their gross receipts taxes. They're struggling to get by."" The Hispanic voters, the other solid bloc that's giving him a lead, have their own reason to stay with Obama. ""It's not just the issue of immigration but the tone of how Republicans talked about it during the primaries."" The parade ends and the single highway fills up with cars. I drive back to Albuquerque. Heinrich's opponent, former Rep. Heather Wilson, is shaking hands at a University of New Mexico football tailgate. The moderate Republican held the state's first district, Albuquerque and its environs, until she left for an ill-fated 2008 Senate bid--and Heinrich took her seat. Every profile of Wilson mentions three facts: that she's a Rhodes Scholar, that she's an Air Force veteran, and that she's one of the best campaigners alive. She dives for footballs in the parking lot. She knows voters by their first names. During a brief interview, she's stopped three times by people who want to catch up with her. I watch her tell a medical student that she's going to repeal Obamacare. He doesn't seem to agree. He asks for a photo with her, anyway. Oh, and she's losing. Public polls put her 10 points behind Heinrich. American Crossroads has been on the air since summer with ads that portray her in full-on walking-talking-with-real-people mode. (It absolutely doesn't hurt that Wilson used to be on the board of American Crossroads.) Wilson's own ads introduce voters to an ordinary person who got Social Security benefits after her father died. But the National Republican Senatorial Committee pulled ads in September, and there's that matter of Mitt Romney not even trying to win here. ""A number of environmental groups spent money here right after the primary,"" explains Wilson. ""Actually, the environmentalist groups, together, spent more money than the groups aligned the other way. So it's been a little bit to my detriment, but I defend their right to criticize me."" It's a good thing, sort of, that the presidential candidates aren't driving out their own vote with ads and campaign stops. ""There's not as much clutter. Four years ago, everything and everyone was on TV. And it may end up being very, very close here."" The glow from the first presidential debate is only slowly fading, and plenty of Republicans here talk about Romney knocking the president flat again and pulling into a New Mexico tie. Plenty more of them say they now live in Blue America. On Sunday, I go to an early church service in Rio Rancho. It's the city-sprawl heart of Sandoval County, one of the regions that flipped from Bush 2004 to Obama 2008. After a service, an usher hears what I'm doing in town and attempts to explain why the state's been swung. ""When Mitt Romney made that statement about the 47 percent, I knew what he meant,"" says John Hawkos. ""He was saying that 47 percent of people wouldn't vote for him. He wasn't saying he wouldn't do anything to help them. You've got a demographic here that's going to vote Democratic forever. You could put David Duke and Al Sharpton on the same ticket, and as long as they were running on a Democratic ticket they could get elected.""

This article also said that Shiprock, N.M., is in the northeastern part of the state. It is in northwestern New Mexico."

Just yesterday, the conservative super PAC Restore Our Future says it brought in one of its biggest hauls on record, at one point receiving more than two donations every second. (The group has yet to disclose the total amount.) Having an extra $100 million on hand in the home stretch could help Romney make up for lost time. See Mitt Romney's earlier rays of hope.

He promised to do this without costing the government any revenue or forcing middle-class taxpayers to make up the difference. How would he make the math work? By eliminating tax loopholes and deductions. No way, said President Obama: ""If you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class."" Romney insisted he could make the numbers add up, but he wouldn't say how. ""I'm going to work together with Congress"" to figure out ""what are the various ways we could bring down deductions,"" he asserted. This preposterous dodge has been going on for weeks. Romney, Paul Ryan, and their surrogates have refused to say which deductions they'd eliminate. But their magic accounting, whatever it is, can't be half as creative as the arguments they've concocted for hiding it. Here's a catalogue of their excuses so far. 1. Specificity is for accountants. Last week on Meet the Press, David Gregory objected that Romney ""has failed to enumerate any of the deductions that he would eliminate."" Romney's representative on the show, Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., dismissed the objection: ""Gov. Romney has laid out a direction and a vision for the direction of this country. He's not an accountant. He is not going to go line by line, as much as you like him to do, through the budget."" 2. Specificity is for incumbents. George Stephanopoulos made the same point to Christie on This Week: ""Gov. Romney has not been willing to lay out which deductions are going to go away for the wealthy."" Christie replied: ""Well, listen, the president of the United States has an obligation after four years as being president to be the one who is the most specific."" 3. Specificity is presumptuous. On Sept. 16, David Brody of the Christian Broadcasting Network asked Ryan: ""Is there a reason you guys aren't naming specific tax loopholes?"" Ryan humbly explained his reticence: ""We don't want to presume to say, 'Here's exactly our way or the highway. Take it or leave it, Congress.'"" 4. Specificity is micromanagement. On Sept. 27, CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, ""I just want to know if we're going to get specifics by the time November rolls around."" Portman lectured him: ""You don't dictate to Congress exactly how it's going to be done. You need to work with Congress to actually get it done. You know, this is a president in Barack Obama who has not been able to work with Congress on anything substantial ... And so I think it does not make sense to lay out all the specifics."" 5. Vagueness is standard practice. On Sept. 16, CNN's Candy Crowley asked whether Romney ""needs to come out and say specifically, 'Here is what I would do to reform the tax code. Here are the loopholes I would close.'"" Romney's surrogate, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, responded that Romney was ""running a perfectly fine campaign. This is the level of specificity that American candidates usually give in a campaign."" 6. Vagueness is leadership. In an interview for the Sept. 23 broadcast of 60 Minutes, Scott Pelley pressed Romney: ""What are we talking about? The mortgage deduction? The charitable deduction?"" Romney spurned the question. ""To work together with people across the aisle,"" Romney explained, ""you don't hand them a complete document and say, 'Here, take this or leave it.' Look, leadership is not a take-it-or-leave-it thing. We've seen too much of that in Washington."" 7. Voters don't need specifics. Stephanopoulos asked Christie, ""But don't voters have a right to know what those [loopholes] are?"" Christie brushed him off: ""Voters have a right to know what direction he's going to take the country in."" 9. Principles are specifics. Gregory asked Romney, ""Where are the specifics of how you get to this math?"" Romney spun the question around: ""Well, the specifics are these, which is those principles I described ... I'm not going to increase the tax burden on middle income families."" When Gregory pressed for ""an example of a loophole that you will close,"" Romney offered another generality: ""Well, I can tell you that people at the high end, high-income taxpayers, are going to have fewer deductions and exemptions."" 8. ""Vision"" is all the clarity you need. In several interviews, Ryan deflected questions about specific tax loopholes by calling Romney's plan a ""vision,"" ""framework,"" or ""outline."" ""That's what Gov. Romney is laying out, is a very clear vision,"" Christie told Stephanopoulos. ""He's going to negotiate with Congress about those loopholes. ... He's not going to lock himself into something now."" 10. We don't have time to explain it. ""You haven't given me the math,"" Chris Wallace protested in a Fox News interview with Ryan last Sunday. ""I don't have the time,"" Ryan pleaded. ""It would take me too long to go through all of the math."" 11. We'll seek public input after the election. ""We don't want to do this in a backroom-deal kind of a way, like Obamacare was done,"" Ryan argued on the Sept. 9 edition of Face the Nation. ""We want to have a debate out in front, work with Congress, work with the public to find out what are the priorities we want to have in the tax system."" A week later, Ryan gave Brody the same shtick: ""We want to do this in front, in the public, through congressional hearings with Congress, so that we can get to the best conclusion with a public participation."" In a Bloomberg interview this week, Ryan repeated, ""We want to have, you know, Congress and the public participate in this debate about how best to do this."" Romney and Ryan believe deeply in informing and consulting the public, but not until after the election. 12. Politicians, not voters, represent the people's will. When Ryan tried his after-the-election spiel, Stephanopoulos asked the obvious follow-up: ""But why not specify the loopholes now?"" Ryan answered: ""Because we want to have this debate in the public. We want to have this debate with Congress. And we want to do this with the consent of the elected representatives of the people."" That's what Romney and Ryan are selling. They promise they can cut tax rates and eliminate enough loopholes to maintain the same revenue without touching any of the credits or deductions--mortgage interest, charitable contributions, medical expenses, health insurance, child credits, state and local taxes--that might hurt the middle class. They won't tell you how they'll do this, because that information might affect your vote and thereby get in the way of true democracy--which, as we all know, consists of a post-election negotiation between the Romney administration, a Republican Congress, and year-round Washington tax lobbyists who represent ordinary folks like you. If you buy that, you'll learn the hard way what W.C. Fields taught 76 years ago: Never give a sucker an even break.

A full 67 percent of voters said Romney won, while only 25 percent said Obama did. That's not just a win, it's a landslide. CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said, ""No presidential candidate has topped 60 percent in that question since it was first asked in 1984."" Indeed, in the first debate of 2008, Obama only bested John McCain 40 percent to 26 percent. In 2004, John Kerry beat George W. Bush 53 percent to 37 percent. So what does that mean for the race? We'll know more when we get the results of the swing state polls currently in progress. But investors in the prediction market InTrade have already had their say: Romney's stock rose more than 7 points yesterday. Romney needed a very good day, and he got it.
