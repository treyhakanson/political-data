Allow us, though, to indulge a path to the GOP nomination for establishment hero Sen. Marco Rubio that would explain his recent strategy of ignoring Trump. It is the ""winnowing"" school of nomination victory, and it is rightly falling out of fashion--even with the candidate himself. The first step would be for Rubio to eliminate Sen. Ted Cruz, who's having a difficult time expanding his coalition beyond very conservative voters. If Trump beats Cruz in his home state of Texas on Super Tuesday, Cruz would face extraordinary pressure to drop out. This would explain why Rubio--until Wednesday night, at least--had been focused on hammering Cruz and ignoring Trump. The second step would be to somehow get Gov. John Kasich, who's having a difficult time expanding his coalition beyond a very small subset of moderate voters, to come to his senses and drop out of the race before his home state of Ohio votes on March 15. Rubio, then, would have to start accumulating delegates en masse in the winner-take-all contests beginning that Tuesday, starting with his home state of Florida. He would subsequently have to rely on the friendlier back-end of the nominating calendar to catch up to and ultimately surpass Trump. As with any theory about how Rubio wins the Republican presidential nomination, there are annoying, real-world complications that immediately come into view. Cruz may have a narrower appeal than Rubio overall, but he cannot be relied upon to lose Texas. The state's polling is all over the place right now, with some recent surveys showing Cruz and Trump in a tie and others showing Cruz with a safe lead. Given all of the momentum Trump has after his dominant victories in South Carolina and Nevada, we should expect Texas to be fairly close. But it is still Cruz's home state. He received the endorsement of Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday, and early voting in Texas has been underway since Feb. 16. Worse for Rubio, Cruz is much more likely to win his home state than the Florida senator is to win his. The first Florida poll in a month came out on Thursday, and it tells the same story that previous polls told: Trump is straight crushing. He leads with 44 percent to Rubio's 28 and Cruz's 12. (A top Rubio strategist is instructing us in the media to ""chill"" over this poll, for what it's worth, but it hardly seems unfair to believe that Trump is maintaining the strong lead he's always had in Florida.) Even in the highly unlikely scenario that both Cruz and Kasich were out of the race on March 15, Trump would likely peel off enough of their support to maintain his margin above Rubio. And either with or without Kasich in the race, Rubio doesn't appear to have much of a shot at Ohio. In other words, Rubio cannot rely on the calendar to save him. Cruz would use any Texas victory as a justification to stay in the race indefinitely, even if voting thus far has shown that he struggles to expand, or even maintain, his base of support. Rubio would likely still stay in the race even if he lost Florida, now that he's the party-backed horse. Kasich may not be long for this race, but it doesn't really matter. If the field never winnows to a two-person race, the party never reaches the point where anti-Trump voters can coalesce behind a single alternative candidate--or at least not until it's too late. After March 15--when Cruz's, Rubio's, and Kasich's home states of Texas, Florida, and Ohio will have all finally voted--more than half of bound delegates will have been awarded, a large proportion of them to Donald Trump. And even if Rubio did win Florida: Congratulations, he will have won his home state. Then what? The situation is far too late and dire for the usual cutesy overthinking about lanes and winnowing to be the first priority of those who back the remaining non-Trump candidates. There is no viable strategy to the nomination that circumvents Trump; the candidates will have to go through him. It is counterproductive for Cruz and Rubio to mostly bombard each other when neither has much reason to drop out because they're losing equally. The goal of all sides has to be to bring Trump's numbers down. If Trump is blitzing his way to the nomination, any strategy that includes ignoring him indefinitely as a central tactic is not nearly as sophisticated as its designers think it is. Rubio and his people have apparently taken a hint. Wednesday night--shock of shocks--the candidate who is losing badly to Trump introduced some criticisms of Trump. This sets up a clash between Rubio and Trump in Thursday night's debate, which will allow us to see if Rubio melts in head-to-head conflict the way he did with Chris Christie. Rubio had to incur Trump's wrath at some point. If there's a winner in him, he should welcome it. Read more Slate coverage of the GOP primary."	The Primary Calendar Won't Save the GOP From Donald Trump
1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/cruz_and_rubio_are_doing_nothing_to_stop_donald_trump.html	"There were several winners of Tuesday night's Nevada caucuses. Let us take the time to celebrate each of them. Sen. Ted Cruz had a massive ""third-place win,"" a term his campaign actually relayed to reporters, on the record, intending for it to be published. This third-place win, per the Cruz campaign, marked an absolutely dominating victory over second-place loser Sen. Marco Rubio. ""Nevada, Rubio's Firewall: The Place Where He Would Win Big,"" read the alert from the Cruz campaign Tuesday night. It is true that the Rubio campaign had pointed some months ago to Nevada as the early state where their guy had the strongest chance of winning. What a devastating silver medal it was, then, to Cruz's victory bronze. But what if Rubio, too, is the secret winner? It didn't take long for the Nevada results to start trickling in before Rubio's team was getting him booked on the morning chat show circuit to describe his Nevada conquest. Take a lap, Marco, and slap some fives. You may not have anything close to an old-fashioned ""first-place victory"" under your belt yet, and in no contest have you bested Donald Trump. But that's all going to change soon when the intimidating streak of second- and third-place finishes you rack up on Super Tuesday forces Cruz, who may actually win a very large state on March 1, to drop out. After all, as you said Wednesday morning on Fox News, ""you don't win the nomination by how many states you win."" That's particularly great news for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who finished in fifth place in the Nevada caucuses, pummeling Rubio in the for-pretend game that Kasich's campaign is playing. ""Contrary to what his campaign is trying to portray,"" the statement from Kasich campaign manager John Weaver read, ""Senator Rubio just endured another disappointing performance despite being the highest spending candidate in Nevada. He also missed an opportunity to back up the notion that he can bring new people into the Republican Party or succeed above expectations in a diverse state."" Fair, but come on: Isn't it a little crass for the fifth-place winner to be rubbing it in so nastily to the second-place loser? At least give the guy who finished 20 percentage points ahead of you a couple of days to recuperate before mocking him. It is no surprise that these losers, who are losing now more than ever, would write up their post-Nevada statements in such a loser-ish manner. After South Carolina, the campaigns of Rubio, Cruz, and Kasich largely focused on trashing each other rather than going after the guy at the top with all the votes. (Cruz being the occasional exception.) Where did this get them? Further entrenched in their beliefs that none of them need to drop out anytime soon, and now 20-plus points behind Donald Trump as a field rather than 10 percentage points behind, as they were in South Carolina. The only candidate making progress is Trump, and none of the other candidates seem particularly concerned about that. But surely the well-heeled donors within the Republican establishment who are scared of Trump running away with this thing will take care of him while the non-Trump candidates sort themselves out, right? Nope. And nope in large part because they're scared that Donald Trump will call them mean names. These donors, Politico reported earlier this week, ""worry that, if they fund higher-profile attacks, they could come under attack from Trump, who this week fired a warning shot at one of the few major donors to the anti-Trump efforts, Marlene Ricketts, tweeting that her family 'better be careful, they have a lot to hide!' "" The will to stop Trump does not appear to exist, and that is pathetic. Far too many party forces are misreading the ""winnowing"" theory, which argues that Trump can be defeated if he is positioned in a one-on-one matchup. I think there's merit to this theory, though less so with each passing contest and day crossed off the calendar. What this theory never entailed, though, is the idea that Cruz, Rubio, and Kasich would let Trump proceed unimpeded while they were sorting the anti-Trump process out among themselves. It is campaign malpractice for the Rubio campaign, in particular, to be holding its fire on Trump, and it's indicative of that campaign's glib belief that delegates will naturally funnel Rubio's way in the long run because ... because they just will. They won't. There is a debate Thursday night, the final one before Trump is projected to pick up another eight to 10 states next Tuesday. If the non-Trump candidates spend the full two hours laser-focused on attacking Trump, then maybe there's some hope for the diminishing anti-Trump contingent of the party after all. If they conduct this debate in their usual manner, with Trump chilling at his dais while Rubio and Cruz bicker into the void about Senate votes from 2013, the GOP establishment might as well throw its remaining heft behind Trump to curry favor with him before he takes control of the party.

2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/the_violence_of_donald_trump_in_las_vegas.html	"LAS VEGAS--With political events come protesters. Some attend for a particular issue, some for attention. But either way, they're an inevitable part of electoral politics and most politicians have learned to deal with the natural disruptions that come with speaking in public. That is, unless the politician is Donald Trump. At a certain point in Trump's Monday night speech at the South Point Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, the real estate mogul had to compete for attention. Behind him, a man held a sign that read, ""Veterans to Trump: End Hate Speech Against Muslims."" The crowd, estimated at 8,000 people, could see the man and the sign and started to yell. ""Get him out!"" said some attendees. ""Throw him out!"" yelled others. Trump noticed and voiced the anger of his supporters. ""Get the hell out,"" he said, as security removed the protester. The crowd booed and cheered and chanted (""USA! USA!""), and Trump continued with his address, moving--as usual--to attacks on immigrants, Muslims, and foreign countries. Trump continued as normal, but he was interrupted again. This time, he could see the protesters as they were hauled out by security. And this time, he had a little more to say. ""You know what they used to do to guys like that in a place like this?"" he asked the crowd. ""He'd go out in a stretcher."" His audience cheered. A moment later, he went further: ""You know we're not allowed to touch him? The police are touching him gently and he's smiling and he's having a good time. I'd like to punch him in the face."" Again, the crowd went wild. This isn't the first time Trump has voiced a proclivity toward violence. At one event last November, a Black Lives Matter protester was kicked and pushed to the ground. Trump  later responded that ""maybe he should have been roughed up."" Overall, Trump's events have been marked by confrontations between typical protesters and his supporters, who react with anger and occasionally violence. At an event in Richmond, Virginia, for example, Trump supporters physically confronted a group of immigration activists. One attendee spit in the face of a protester. The activists were escorted out. It's true that elections inflame passions. And that the anonymity of crowds can breed the worst in people. But the violent rhetoric and violence of Donald Trump's campaign is unusual. You don't see this kind of behavior with other candidates, whether it's Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton on the left or Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio on the right. When they face protesters or hecklers, they deal with them in a polite, civilized way. Cruz will even make a joke about the First Amendment, praising the protesters for using their constitutional rights. But while the violence around Trump is unusual, it's not surprising. Trump's entire appeal is built around aggression and, yes, violence. To call for mass deportation, for example, is to entertain and endorse state violence. To back waterboarding and recite violent fantasies of wartime revenge against Muslims is to do the same. Donald Trump isn't just running as a man who ""makes deals,"" he's running as a nationalist and a bully who will humiliate the nation's adversaries--actual foes like Iran, as well as alleged ones like China and Mexico--and restore America's symbolic manhood. When Donald Trump says, ""I'd like to punch him in the face,"" he's not just talking about a particular protester. In a speech laden with attacks on other countries for ""stealing jobs"" and on whole groups of people as dangerous and suspect, an open wish for violence is the subtext of Trump, made text. The good news is that we're still far from serious violence. But watching and observing Trump and his supporters, I'm afraid we're not far from when that becomes a possibility. What happens if Trump begins to lose and starts to lash out against opponents? Or if he becomes the nominee and suddenly is met with concerted opposition from the people--Latino immigrants, Muslim Americans, even black Americans--who he has attacked and demogagued? Will the Trump movement restrain itself? Or, following their leader, will those backers respond with their hands in fists?"	The Undercurrent of Violence Bubbling Underneath Each Donald Trump Event
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/ted_cruz_s_isn_t_chasing_donald_trump_on_immigration.html	"A narrative emerged on Tuesday that Ted Cruz changed his position on immigration enforcement to an even harsher one basically overnight. Even a cursory examination of what he actually said, though, shows that this is not really the case. In an interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly on Monday, Cruz was asked if he, like Donald Trump, would ""round up 12 million illegal aliens here, and if so how?"" ""Listen, we should enforce the law,"" he responded. ""How do we enforce the law? Yes, we should enforce them. We should build a wall, we should triple the Border Patrol. And federal law requires that anyone here illegally that's apprehended should be deported."" ""But would you look for them, though?"" O'Reilly pressed. ""Mr. Trump would look for them to get them out. Would you do that if you were president?"" ""Bill, of course you would. That's what [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] exists for,"" he said. ""We have law enforcement that looks for people who are violating the laws, that apprehends them and deports them."" It's not clear when Cruz ever in the past denied that ICE, under his administration, would not seek to find undocumented immigrants and deport them. All he's ever said is that he won't go about doing so in a blanketed, ""door-to-door"" manner, which is a different question than the one he was asked last night. Several pieces Tuesday are characterizing this as a shift in position from one laid out in a January interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, in which the anchor asked specifically whether Cruz would go ""door-to-door,"" rounding people up. ""No, I don't intend to send jackboots to knock on your door and every door in America. That's not how we enforce the law for any crime,"" Cruz said. ""We don't have any system that knocks on the doors of every person in America ... We also don't have people going door-to-door looking for murderers. We don't live in a police state. We do have law enforcement."" All Cruz was saying in that interview is that Tapper's line of questioning about how to go about deporting people--and how Trump has supposedly supported doing so--was stupid. Law enforcement isn't conducted by going ""door-to-door"" looking for offenders without cause because that's both constitutionally dicey and extremely inefficient. Cruz was not denying that under his presidency, undocumented immigrants would be apprehended in their homes if they've been ordered for deportation. In his interviews with both O'Reilly and Tapper, Cruz went on quite similarly about how he would target undocumented immigrants for deportation. He spoke about fully implementing a biometric entry-exit system that would allow the government to know when immigrants have overstayed their visas and enforce deportations from there. O'Reilly seems to believe that it's not legal to go to the home of an undocumented immigrant who's been ordered to leave and detain them for deportation. Has he not been following the news? ICE raids are very much a thing, and the Obama administration, despite its deprioritization of deporting certain undocumented immigrants, is still fond of them. Would Cruz's administration go to the homes of people who are ordered to be deported and apprehend them? Yes. Would he go ""door-to-door"" asking every random person for their papers? No. Does this mean that he would have a very difficult time deporting all 12 million undocumented immigrants already here? Yes. Cruz's position is not, by the way, more ""humane"" than Trump's on the whole. Cruz, as he is quick to emphasize in these interviews, is to the right of Trump and Sen. Marco Rubio on immigration, since theoretically, Cruz would not allow a single undocumented immigrant in the country to ever gain legal status. Rubio refuses to rule out a path to either citizenship or legal status for undocumented immigrants already here once the border has been secured; Trump speaks about letting some of ""the good ones"" back in after they've first been deported. Only in Cruz's case is there no possibility of light at the end of the tunnel. Read more Slate coverage of the GOP primary."

4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/donald_trump_is_not_inevitable.html	"Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee for president. That's the prediction echoing across TV studios since Trump's victory in South Carolina on Saturday. And what's the basis for this inference? Precedent. As ABC's George Stephanopoulos put it: ""No Republican who's won both New Hampshire and South Carolina has ever lost the nomination."" That statement about second and third states on the GOP nominating calendar is true. In the last two days, it has permeated the Internet, spooking reporters into talk of a Trump coronation. But the magical power of these two states is a myth. It's one of those patterns that looks decisive but turns out to be dubious. If you look more comprehensively at history and at current polling, it's still way too early to call a Trump nomination inevitable. The GOP didn't hold a presidential primary in South Carolina until 1980. In 1984 and 2004, with Republican presidents in office and seeking re-election, both states were uncontested. They were won by the sitting vice president in 1988 and by the incumbent president in 1992. In 1996, 2000, and 2012, the candidate who prevailed in New Hampshire didn't win South Carolina. So in the last 35 years, there's been only one open nomination contest in which the same Republican won both states. That was 2008. The winner that year, Sen. John McCain, went on to capture the nomination. But McCain's position in surveys taken before and after the 2008 South Carolina primary was nothing like Trump's current one. In a CNN poll conducted between Jan. 14 and 17, 2008, just before that year's South Carolina primary, 66 percent of Republicans said McCain had ""the personality and leadership qualities a president should have."" Only 33 percent said he lacked those qualities. Contrast that with Trump's situation. In December 2015, a Monmouth University survey asked Republicans whether Trump had ""the temperament needed to carry out the role of president."" At that point, 35 percent disagreed with that statement--not much worse than the 33 percent who had said in 2008 that McCain lacked ""the personality and leadership qualities a president should have."" But the more people saw of Trump, the more they turned against him. By January 2016, 45 percent of Republicans interviewed by CBS News and the New York Times rejected the proposition that Trump ""has the right kind of temperament and personality to be a good president."" And by February, in a Fox News poll taken just before the South Carolina primary, 48 percent of Republicans disagreed with the statement that Trump ""has the temperament to serve effectively as president."" This difference between voters' judgment of Trump's personality and their judgment of McCain's contributes to a broader difference in favorability. In an ABC News/Washington Post survey taken between Jan. 9 and 12, 2008, a week before the vote in South Carolina, McCain registered a 77 percent favorable rating among Republicans. That was the highest score of any candidate tested. A Pew poll conducted between Jan. 9 and 13, 2008, found similar results: McCain led the field with a 71 percent favorable rating and only a 23 percent unfavorable rating. By the end of the month, the race had narrowed to three candidates, but McCain still posted the highest favorable rating (72 percent) and the lowest unfavorable (19 percent). Trump's standing is much weaker. His unfavorable rating among Republicans, as measured by a Quinnipiac poll shortly before South Carolina, was 31 percent--around 10 points higher than McCain's. That's also easily the worst score among the Republican candidates who remain in the race today. The political effects of Trump's unattractiveness, compared with McCain's broad appeal, can be measured in two ways. The first is that Republican voters in 2016 are far less likely to embrace Trump as their second choice than Republican voters in 2008 were to embrace McCain. In the January 2008 ABC/Post survey, McCain didn't just lead the horse race. He was also, among seven candidates listed as options, the most popular second choice of Republican voters. In the field of Republicans running in 2016, however, Trump is the least popular. In a Suffolk University poll taken between Feb. 11 and 15, only 9 percent of Republicans named Trump as their second choice. That was the lowest number among the six candidates listed, including Jeb Bush. Trump did slightly better in an NBC/Journal survey conducted between Feb. 14 and 16, earning the second choices of 12 percent of Republicans. But that was still the worst performance among the five candidates who are still in the race today. In a Feb. 15 to 17 Fox News poll, 11 percent of Republicans named Trump as their second choice, compared to 27 percent for Sen. Marco Rubio, and 20 percent for Sen. Ted Cruz. But Trump's bigger problem is that, unlike McCain, he has already lost the votes of too many Republicans, not just in the primaries but in the general election. McCain didn't just have high levels of support within the party. He also engendered the least resistance. In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll taken between Jan. 20 and 22, 2008, just after his victory in South Carolina, 9 percent of Republicans said that if McCain were nominated, they wouldn't vote for him in the general election. Another 12 percent said they would withhold judgment until the Democratic nominee was selected. On both of these measures, McCain posted the least negative scores among the five Republicans listed. Trump's numbers, according to four polls taken between this year's New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries, are significantly worse. In the Suffolk poll, 17 percent of Republicans said that if Trump became the nominee, they would be ""scared."" In a CBS/Times survey, 20 percent of Republicans said they wouldn't support Trump as the nominee. In the Quinnipiac poll, 28 percent said they ""would definitely not support [Trump] for the Republican nomination."" (By comparison, 17 percent ruled out Cruz, and 13 percent ruled out Rubio.) And in the NBC/Journal poll, 42 percent said they couldn't imagine themselves ""supporting [Trump] for the Republican nomination."" Only Jeb Bush was more broadly rejected. Trump might well win the nomination. I've made the case, using other surveys, that his views are quite representative of today's Republican voter. But if it happens, it won't be because he pulled off a magic double in New Hampshire and South Carolina. The only other Republican who has won those two primaries back to back in the last 35 years, without already being president or vice president, went on to capture the nomination not because he was just like Trump, but because he wasn't."

6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/trump_will_keep_winning_as_long_as_cruz_and_rubio_remain.html	"The results of the South Carolina primary helped the Republican Party winnow the field, effectively, to a three-candidate race. But there's a long way to go for the GOP to get to two. Donald Trump retains an edge until that happens. After Saturday's win, Trump has now easily pulled off the New Hampshire-South Carolina double. Modern Republican electoral history is black-and-white here: the candidate who does this wins the nomination. Modern Republican electoral history also has a small sample size, though, and there's still a scenario in which Trump goes down: if he's faced with a one-on-one contest against either Sen. Marco Rubio or Sen. Ted Cruz. The problem for the anti-Trump majority is how to get from that three-candidate race, which South Carolina's results reinforced is the true dynamic of the contest, to a two-person race. Rubio and Cruz essentially tied for second place in South Carolina with support in the low-20s, compared to Trump's more than 32 percent of the vote. Much like after Rubio's third-place finish to Cruz and Trump in Iowa earlier this month, the Rubio-industrial complex is touting this double-digit defeat as a dramatic victory for the Florida senator. If he finishes in second, he will have started the nominating contests with 3-5-2 finishes--far away from his pre-voting ""3-2-1"" strategy, a path that acknowledged the importance of winning an early state. There's only one early state left. Though Nevada is a caucus state and we shouldn't hand it to him just yet, Trump is dominating there in a way that he was not in Iowa, the only completed contest so far that he did not win. Cruz, meanwhile, has claimed at least one win, but hasn't been able to translate that into gains elsewhere in the country. Cruz was supposed to be an Iowa winner with the resources to build from there, unlike recent winners Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum. It's not promising for him that he's going to finish somewhere in the low-20s in South Carolina after what amounted to a bye week in New Hampshire. It's also hard to see where Cruz gets his wins now, with the notable exception of Texas. And he needs his wins, soon, since his delegate path involves sweeping through the South on March 1 to build up a lead that positions him as the front-runner heading into the big winner-take-all states coming on March 15. The thing is, South Carolina is very much in the South. And Trump crushed him there. The options for the GOP to find someone who can take Trump one-on-one are now a candidate with the most room to grow, but who hasn't come close to winning a contest, and another candidate who's won a contest but is having trouble expanding his support beyond very conservative voters. On the whole, Rubio has the better argument. With Jeb Bush now officially out of the race and John Kasich living on fumes, he could suck up enough votes (and money) to turn in stronger performances than he has so far. And the calendar will get much more favorable to him--or, at least, much less favorable to Cruz--beginning on March 15. But even if Cruz does begin trending behind Rubio, what rationale will there be for him to drop out? Most candidates drop out when the money's gone, and money is not a problem for Cruz. If his support isn't likely to grow much with Rubio still in the race, neither is it likely to collapse. He can stay around and hope to catch fire at some point along the way--or at least try to secure enough delegates to deny any candidate an outright majority, and take his claim to the convention. For months one of the leading stories of the election had been the logjam in the ""establishment lane"" between Rubio, Bush, Kasich, and Chris Christie. This was the story of New Hampshire: four candidates splitting up the large anti-Trump voting bloc and allowing Trump to claim a blowout victory. New Hampshire punted on its duty to select an establishment ""winner,"" but South Carolina has now resolved that issue. The ""establishment lane"" question may now be all but out of the way, but it's replaced with an even trickier one: Who emerges from the ""anti-Trump lane"" at this point? The stakes are becoming much higher now than they were in New Hampshire, or even South Carolina. If the Cruz-Rubio collective action problem doesn't get resolved, Trump will benefit and his prize will be much more than a couple of early primaries. He'll either win the nomination or head into a convention fight with the delegate lead. In the latter case, wresting the nomination from the delegate leader wouldn't be a pretty sight."

Two nominating contests will take place on Saturday: the South Carolina primary for the GOP and the Nevada caucus for the Democrats. Donald Trump is favored to win in South Carolina, and Clinton has a narrow lead over Bernie Sanders in Nevada. But the runners-up matter, too. A bad performance in South Carolina could put the kibosh on Marco Rubio, who came in third in Iowa and fifth in New Hampshire. And if Sanders gets close, in a state that just a few weeks ago Clinton was expected to win easily, that's going to cause all sorts of hand-wringing at Hillary HQ. Now you can watch the spin in real time as the results trickle in. Below, you'll see left-leaning commentators on the left and right-leaning commentators on the right. Whose candidacies will survive South Carolina and Nevada? Let the spin begin! See more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign.

Not nearly enough time has been spent examining another central aspect of his appeal: His penchant for conspiracy theories. Trump's first big contribution to national politics was his vigorous support for ""birtherism""--the belief, against a vast range of evidence, that Barack Obama was born in Kenya. One of his first major contributions to this presidential race was the statement that on Sept. 11, ""thousands and thousands"" of Muslims gathered in New Jersey gathered to cheer as the twin towers burned. In its essence, a conspiracy theory is the modern equivalent of a myth: It's a story that people tell to explain otherwise inexplicable events. The appeal of conspiracy theories is deep because the human need for meaning is so profound. Why does the sun rise in the morning? Because that's when the God Apollo rides his chariot across the sky. Why did Antonin Scalia die right now, in the middle of a presidential campaign? Because someone is pulling strings behind the scenes, trying to manipulate events. The human brain is designed to reject the random, the haphazard, the arbitrary. It's just too much for many people to accept that accidents happen, planes crash, ships founder on the rocks, and elderly people die in their sleep: A dramatic event must fit into a larger narrative. For others, conspiracy theories are a useful way to explain personal failure: It wasn't me, it was the freemasons/capitalists/Jews/immigrants/murderers of Scalia who deprived me of success. Americans are no strangers to conspiracy theories. The Kennedy assassination's ""second shooter,"" Area 51, the faked moon landing, Obama birtherism, and 9/11 trutherism--all of these have their adherents. But we have been blessed in recent history by a political system that has, for the most part, kept them outside the mainstream of American political life. With the possible exception of the anti-masonic movement in the 19th century and some of the madder moments of the Nixon presidency, conspiratorial thinking has never been central to the political debate. Instead, we have become accustomed to the idea that political debate must be, at least in theory, related to reality. But other nations have not been so lucky. When conspiracy theorists actually run the government, they can do enormous damage, diverting public funds and institutions to cope with imaginary threats. Srdja Popovic, a Serbian activist who helped overthrow the authoritarian leader Slobodan Milosevic, has reminisced about the day he switched on the television and learned of a ""high-level CIA conspiracy to overthrow Milosevic by using well-paid student activists,"" among them himself. Much later, he learned that police really were spending time and money searching the world for the international headquarters of his movement. In fact, it was in his parents' living room in central Belgrade. In the Soviet Union, that kind of thinking led to mass murder. I'm guessing that Americans' longstanding aversion to conspiracy theory derives from our devotion to commerce: Businessmen, at the end of the day, need to have a grasp on reality to make money. But something did change in American public life with the appearance of Glenn Beck and other dodgy members of what the writer David Frum has called the ""conservative entertainment complex."" The result has been the general deterioration of trust in the government, and, after 2008, the financial establishment made the situation worse. Now Trump has placed conspiratorial thinking squarely at the center of the Republican primary. A whole generation of people who get their information from random sources on the Internet have eagerly taken up his invented stories and are reposting them as fast as they can. Trump's lies and his distortions of reality don't stick to him because his followers are not interested in truth. They prefer satisfying stories. Popovic has written that it's impossible to debunk conspiracy theorists, and I can confirm that he is right, being the subject of several myself. He argues, instead, that the best weapon against conspiracy thinking is laughter. He and his friends wore T-shirts with the slogan ""Touch me--I'm a foreign mercenary."" Maybe, just maybe, that might work: When President Obama mocked Trump's birther campaign back at the White House correspondents dinner in 2011, Trump did shut up for a while. But I'm afraid that as Trump looks more and more likely to become the Republican presidential candidate, it's going to get harder and harder to find him funny.

9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/president_obama_s_nine_options_for_picking_the_next_supreme_court_justice.html	Justice Antonin Scalia is dead, and President Obama has a problem. Republican senators are refusing to confirm or even consider anyone Obama nominates to replace Scalia. They say that Obama has less than a year remaining in office, and therefore this lifetime appointment should be left to the next president. How should Obama respond? Here's a look at his options. 1. Most qualified. This is the simplest approach: Nominate someone who's so clearly fit for the job that senators can't justify standing in the way. Merrick Garland, the chief judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, has the bench experience: 19 years on the appeals court and three as chief judge. Patricia Ann Millett, another judge on the D.C. Circuit, has the litigation experience: 32 cases argued before the Supreme Court. But the best way to squeeze Republican senators is to put forward a nominee they've already voted to confirm. By that standard, the best candidates are D.C. Circuit Judge Sri Srinivasan (confirmed 97-0 in 2013), 8th Circuit Judge Jane Kelly (confirmed 96-0 in 2013), and 9th Circuit Judge Jacqueline Nguyen (confirmed 91-3 in 2012). Senators would have to explain why, having already approved these judges, they now refuse to grant them a hearing. 2. Least partisan. If Obama wants to play nice, he could offer Republicans a relatively palatable nominee. Srinivasan clerked for conservative judges, worked in George W. Bush's Justice Department, and has endorsements from two former Republican solicitors general, Ken Starr and Paul Clement. Garland has a judicial record of siding with police. Other potential nominees--U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch and 9th Circuit Judge Paul Watford--have prosecutorial experience to offset their work for liberal causes. But if Obama picks a moderate nominee, and the Senate says no, it would be that much harder for Obama's Democratic successor to sell Republicans a more liberal nominee next year. 3. Best connected. Think of Supreme Court confirmation as lobbying: The smart move is to buy off key players, offering them a candidate they know and like. In this case, Kelly is a good choice: She has an extremely influential fan in Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Alternatively, Obama could nominate someone who's already a member of the Senate, such as Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island (a former U.S. attorney and state attorney general), Cory Booker of New Jersey (a Yale Law School graduate), or Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota (a former county prosecutor who now sits on the Judiciary Committee). 4. Most potent minority. If Republicans are going to stonewall Obama's nominee, the least he can do is make them pay for it in the election. And the best way to do that is to nominate someone who represents a big constituency that will take offense at the stonewalling. Obama has several options: black men (Watford and D.C. Circuit Judge Robert Wilkins), white women (Millett and Kelly), and a black woman (Lynch). But the best group to target, given its size and its importance to Republicans, is Latinos. The Supreme Court has a Puerto Rican justice, Sonia Sotomayor. But this country has 33 million Mexican-Americans. Many of them might be excited by the first nomination of one of their own--say, Justice Mariano-Florentino Cuellar of the California Supreme Court--and furious at Republicans who won't give him a hearing. 5. Most neglected minority. Maybe Obama wants broader diversity, not just another black or Latino. In that case, he could choose someone who has a disability or represents a religious or sexual minority, such as Stanford Law professor Pam Karlan, who's bisexual. But the biggest group that's unrepresented on the court today is Asians. Candidates from this group include Nguyen (whose family comes from Vietnam) and California Supreme Court Justice Goodwin Liu (Taiwan). The boldest pick might be Srinivasan, who's not just an ethnic minority (Indian-American) but also a Hindu. 6. Immigrant. The greatest long-term threat to the Republican Party is that by opposing comprehensive immigration reform and embracing Donald Trump, the GOP will brand itself as the anti-immigrant party. What better way to facilitate this suicide than to make Republicans stand in the way of the court's first non-European immigrant? Srinivasan was born in India. Nguyen was born in Vietnam. Cuellar was born in Mexico. Nominating a naturalized American is just the sort of thing that fits Obama's style. And it sets up just the sort of fight Republicans don't need. 7. Most liberal. If Obama wants an ideological war, he could nominate Karlan, who's proudly progressive on incarceration, the death penalty, and reinterpreting the Constitution. He could pick Lynch, who has targeted racism in policing, or his former White House counsel, Kathryn Ruemmler, who led the legal battle to defend Obamacare. These candidates might mobilize the Democratic base. But they might mobilize the Republican base, too. And that kind of confrontation isn't Obama's style. 8. Youngest. Liu is 45. Cuellar is 43. Leondra Kruger, another justice on the California Supreme Court, is just 39. That kind of youth is attractive when you're looking for a nominee who could extend your legacy for decades. But when the Senate won't confirm your pick, youth is irrelevant. You want a nominee who will help you in the political standoff, not on the court. 9. Wait and see. My money is on Srinivasan. He checks off every box. He's moderate and eminently qualified. He has worked for conservative judges and a Republican president. He was unanimously confirmed to the D.C. Circuit. He would be the court's first Asian and first non-European immigrant. If Republicans stonewall him, they'll look really bad. But one other scenario intrigues me. Over the next month or two, the presidential primaries will shake out. If Hillary Clinton gains control on the Democratic side, and if Sen. Marco Rubio can't do the same in the GOP, Republicans might find themselves staring at the possibility of a November wipeout. They could lose the White House and the Senate. Facing that prospect, they might decide that they're better off cutting a deal with Obama than letting Clinton and the Democrats put a leftist on the court. In that case, Obama and the Republicans could strike a bargain. Or, if he's had enough of bargains, Obama could tell the Republicans that he's just a lame duck, and walk away.

10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/bernie_sanders_pitch_to_black_voters_in_south_carolina.html	"COLUMBIA, South Carolina--Sen. Bernie Sanders often speaks about reducing economic inequality and expanding access to health care and public education. It is hard to get him to talk about much else, really. But not often is Sanders asked to join in worship for these platform planks, as he was at a Tuesday prayer breakfast with black church leaders in Columbia. ""Let us pray for economic and criminal justice reform in this state,"" the invocation began in the gymnasium of Allen University, a small, historically black college a short walk from the much larger University of South Carolina. (Sanders would visit both schools before lunchtime on Tuesday.) And so there was such a prayer, and a relatively wonky one at that, including references to how black Americans are ""disproportionately locked behind bars."" After that prayer followed the one about increasing government support for public education and those in need to quality health care. The prayers were wedged between pre-event performances from a local gospel choir (including a duet of Sam Cooke's ""A Change Is Gonna Come"") and from singer Shirley Murdock, as the mostly black attendees noshed on eggs and bacon. All of which is to say: Bernie Sanders is not in New Hampshire anymore. The coalition of young people and assorted other white liberals who won him 60 percent of the vote in the Granite State do not comprise a majority of Democrats in South Carolina or in many of the Southern states that follow on Super Tuesday. Roughly half of South Carolina Democratic voters are black, and building a successful organization means going through church leaders. As South Carolina state Rep. Joe Neal, a pastor himself, said in introducing Sanders, the church has ""long been the backbone of politics in the African-American community."" Which brings us to the somewhat jarring (and, OK, amusing) image of an elderly Vermont socialist following a rousing gospel performance by bowing his head in prayer. And really bowing, too--his head was practically in line with his knees. Sanders takes nothing lightly. Look. Sanders does not speak much in terms of the holy because, although born and raised Jewish, he is not active in organized religion. He does not operate in many gears, and it would come across as clunky--and inauthentic--if he started prattling on about his most cherished Old Testament verses. But if winning over large numbers of black voters is the key to winning the Democratic nomination, then developing a spiritual fluency is something that wouldn't hurt him. Spiritual is a good way of describing how Sanders has begun speaking to voters of faith. ""My spirituality is that we are all in this together,"" Sanders said in a New Hampshire town hall earlier this month, ""and that when children go hungry, when veterans sleep out on the street, it impacts me. That is my very strong spiritual belief."" Neal quoted this ""simple yet elegant statement"" as a line that ""resounded"" with him, and the applause from his fellow breakfasting supplicants suggested that it did with them, too. The line sounds like something that, first, is a true belief of his, whether or not there's any organized monotheistic backing to it or not. This brand of social justice spirituality also allows him to express his beliefs without straying too far from his campaign platform. Sanders gets uncomfortable if he strays even an inch from his message of economic inequality, so he simply doesn't stray from it. And this version of spirituality, embodied in human solidarity, allows him to stay on topic. Sanders is still most confident--if his decibel level is properly gauged--when he's raging against the billionaires who he says have taken and continue to take all of the money and explaining how he will take it back. That was all politely applauded at the prayer breakfast, too, but nowhere near as deafeningly as it has been at some of the younger, whiter events I saw Sanders host in New Hampshire. Conflict is not the best frame for winning over churchgoers. Sanders stuck largely to a more sermonlike tone. Gone was his apocalyptic opening about a country in late-stage crisis for which ""establishment politics and establishment economics"" are no longer the applicable medicine. In its place he began speaking about ""our mission as human beings, the mission here of our life."" There are some people out there, he notes, who say the purpose of life is ""to accumulate as much money as they possibly can."" These people, of course, are the billionaires. We are not like them. He spoke extensively about reforming the criminal justice system and ending mass incarceration, positions that now earn central booking in his pitch but still blend with everything else. After noting the millions of people whose lives are ""forever altered"" when marijuana possession earns them a criminal record, Sanders offered a useful contrast: the executives of large banks who caused the financial crisis, who earned bonuses for their work instead of criminal records. Gotta change that. There's another part of Sanders' regular presentation during which he urges people to think big to change perceptions of the possible. Usually as his illustrative examples, he talks about the women's suffrage movement, the civil rights movement, and the gay rights movement. On Tuesday he took it in a slightly different direction. ""If people never dreamed, where would we be together? What would we have accomplished?"" he asked. ""If we didn't dream, does anybody here think that we'd have an African-American as president of the United States today?"" And climate change, Sanders' other dear issue next to economic inequality, is usually a subject for which he lists all of the expected ill consequences and then rails against the oil and gas industry and their political cronies. (Indeed, he would return to this formulation during his next stop when addressing University of South Carolina students.) On Tuesday, though, he spoke about the issue, in part, as a matter of faith. ""As religious people,"" he said, ""we have got to understand that we do not have the right to destroy God's earth."" Was that just a we and religious people in the same sentence of a Bernie Sanders stump speech, in reference to climate change? Does it even work? In 11 days, God will reveal all."

Marco Rubio is nice. That's why so many Republican politicians, donors, and party leaders want the senator from Florida, not the senator from Texas, to be the Republican nominee for president. They think Rubio would attract more voters than Cruz in a general election, and polls suggest they're right. But the polls and pols miss an important factor: Tactically, Cruz is smarter than Rubio. That difference is becoming clearer as the candidates grapple with the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. In his three decades on the court, Scalia cast the deciding vote in dozens of cases. His departure raises the prospect that a new liberal justice could supply the fifth vote to overturn these rulings. A Republican presidential candidate who wants to scare and mobilize conservative voters could choose to highlight any of the issues at stake, from contraception to campaign finance to the death penalty. Over the weekend, Cruz and Rubio chose their issues. Rubio picked gay marriage. Cruz picked guns. At the start of Saturday night's debate in Greenville, South Carolina, the candidates were asked for their thoughts about Scalia. Rubio praised the late justice's ""dissent on Obergefell,"" the 2015 case that struck down laws against same-sex marriage. In his closing statement, Rubio added, ""We're going to be a country that says that marriage is between one man and one woman."" On Fox News Sunday, he repeated that ""marriage is between one man and one woman"" and that ""Obergefell should be overturned."" Cruz took a different tack. In a statement on Saturday afternoon, he said Scalia had ""authored some of the most important decisions ever, including District of Columbia v. Heller, which recognized our fundamental right under the Second Amendment to keep and bear arms."" In the debate, Cruz opened with a stark declaration: ""We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that will reverse the Heller decision, one of Justice Scalia's seminal decisions, that upheld the Second Amendment right to keep and to bear arms."" He repeated that warning later in the debate, in a post-debate interview, and on the Sunday morning talk shows. On ABC's This Week, Cruz pleaded:"	Why Heller Is the New Roe v. Wade

14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/justice_antonin_scalia_s_death_may_lead_to_a_constitutional_crisis.html	"Just five minutes after the San Antonio Express-News broke news of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia's death, Conn Caroll, communications director for Utah Republican Mike Lee, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said this on Twitter: ""What is less than zero? The chances of Obama successfully appointing a Supreme Court Justice to replace Scalia?"" Just 30 minutes later, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz chimed in to say the same. ""Justice Scalia was an American hero. We owe it to him, & the Nation, for the Senate to ensure that the next President names his replacement,"" he said on Twitter. National Review writer Charles C.W. Cooke, like other conservative pundits, followed suit with a similar statement. ""Senate must simply refuse to appoint anybody. Would be outrageous to replace a giant like Scalia with a minnow like Sotomayor."" Scalia's death was an incredible shock. This conservative reaction is not. The last Supreme Court Justice to die in office was William Rehnquist, who passed away on Sept. 3, 2005. By the end of the month, President George W. Bush had picked his replacement--John Roberts of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, originally named to fill Sandra Day O'Connor's seat--and the Senate had confirmed it. In theory, we could move at the same speed. There is no question the Obama administration has a short list for Supreme Court appointments, and there's nothing in the Constitution that precludes a president in his final year from selecting an associate justice for the court. After all, a president doesn't disappear after seven years. Barack Obama is still the legitimate executive of the United States government with all the authority that brings. But modern American politics is a polarized place, and there's a stark ideological divide between liberal and conservative jurists. To replace a Republican appointee like Scalia with a Democratic choice is to transform American jurisprudence, pulling it back from the conservative turn of the past 30 years, and swinging it to the left. If the 2014 elections were different--had Democrats turned out to save the Senate from a second Republican wave--then President Obama and his allies could have played a repeat of 2005, quickly bringing a new justice onto the court. But the Senate is held by a firm Republican majority. And unless it wants to immolate itself in the flames of conservative fury, that majority will block Obama's nominee, regardless of skill, belief, or reputation. The stakes are so high that Obama could nominate the ghost of Thurgood Marshall turned flesh and the Republican Senate would reject him as a matter of course. Instead, as per Carroll, Cruz, and Cooke, we'll have to wait until 2017, when the Senate swears in a new president. For Republicans, this is a rational choice. By every measure, this year's race is a coin toss between Republicans and Democrats. But even a coin toss brings better odds than letting Obama cement his legacy by choosing a replacement on the Supreme Court. With that said, there are other, larger questions: Do Republicans hurt their cause by stonewalling the president for more than 11 months between now and the next administration? Does it give Democrats space to run against GOP obstruction and emphasize the stakes of a Republican president for reproductive rights, civil rights, and labor? And what happens if the next president is Sen. Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton, along with a Democratic Senate? Do Republicans concede and allow the president to choose a replacement? Or is the GOP so ideological and so polarized that it refuses to budge for a Democratic president, even in the face of an election? In which case, Scalia's death might set the stage for the first constitutional crisis of our young century. See more of Slate's coverage of Antonin Scalia."

15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/bernie_sanders_radical_past_would_haunt_him_in_a_general_election.html	"On Monday, Politico published a story headlined ""Sanders Once Urged Abolishing CIA."" Michael Crowley reports that in 1974, Bernie Sanders, then a 33-year-old Senate candidate for the anti-war Liberty Union Party, called the spy agency ""a dangerous institution that has got to go,"" one answerable to no one ""except right-wing lunatics who use it to prop up fascist dictatorships."" Such rhetoric, Crowley's article suggests, could prove damaging in a general election. ""Sanders' unexpectedly strong performance in the presidential race has party leaders increasingly alarmed that Republicans would make devastating use of his early career should he win the Democratic nomination,"" Crowley writes. The thing is, Sanders wasn't wrong about the right-wing lunatics or the fascist dictatorships. As he has spent decades pointing out, the CIA helped overthrow the democratically elected Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953. It was complicit in the assassination of Patrice Lumumba, prime minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in 1961. In 1973, it assisted in the military coup against Salvador Allende's socialist government in Chile, which eventually led to the murderous fascist dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. It's perfectly understandable why a fiery young radical would want to do away with the CIA altogether. But it wasn't just radicals who felt this way. In 1991 and then again in 1995, New York Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan introduced bills to scrap the CIA and transfer its functions to the State Department. The liberal writer John Judis made the case for abolishing the CIA in the New Republic in 2005: ""What is clear is that the CIA is broken. And to repair it, we may have to start from scratch."" Responding to Crowley's story in the Intercept, Jon Schwarz reviews the history of mainstream opposition to the CIA and then asks, ""So is it starting to sound to you a bit less like a scandal, and bit more like effective oppo research?"" When it comes to electability, however, Schwarz's question is beside the point. Whether or not Sanders' national security record would jeopardize the United States should he become president, it could jeopardize his candidacy should he become the Democratic nominee. Further, his CIA comments are only a small part of the case that can and will be marshaled against him. Sanders' roots, as we all know, are in the radical left, and over the years he has said and done many things that are unexceptional in that milieu but will likely appear shocking to the uninitiated. Some of his positions, like calling for the dissolution of the CIA, are entirely defensible. Some appear nutty in retrospect and are probably far from his current beliefs. The details of this history have gotten only sporadic media attention. This would immediately change in the improbable but not impossible event that he won the Democratic nomination. Take his relationship with the military. During the Vietnam War, Sanders applied for conscientious objector status, which at the time required religious opposition to all wars, not just the war in question. (Sanders' application was eventually denied, but by then he was too old for the draft.) His campaign spokesman told ABC News that he was a pacifist then but isn't now. In the 1970s, Sanders chaired the left-libertarian Liberty Union Party and competed in two Senate campaigns and two gubernatorial campaigns under its banner. ""Liberty Union calls for a reduction of the U.S. military,"" said the party's statement of principles. That's a wholly reasonable position, but it continued, ""A return to the system of local citizen militias and Coast Guard would provide our nation with ample protection and also protect us from the imperialist impulses of our leaders."" That sounds a lot like getting rid of America's standing Army. There's more. In 1980, Sanders served as an elector for the Socialist Workers Party, which was founded on the principles of Leon Trotsky. According to the New York Times, that party called for abolishing the military budget. It also called for ""solidarity"" with the revolutionary regimes in Iran, Nicaragua, Grenada, and Cuba; this was in the middle of the Iranian hostage crisis. If Sanders ever truly supported disbanding the Army and defunding the Defense Department, he abandoned these positions when he got into national politics. Nevertheless, Republicans will be able to run ads saying that Sanders was part of a communist political party that called for eliminating the military budget, and fact-checkers will not be able to contradict them. Once he was in Congress, Sanders called for deep cuts in military spending. ""Mr. Chairman, it is my view that the United States can maintain its position as the strongest military presence on Earth, and still cut our military spending by 50 percent over five years,"" he said on the House floor in 1991. Cutting the defense budget in half, unlike eliminating it, may be an entirely sensible position. It is, however, an extremely unpopular one. According to Gallup, 64 percent of Americans want either to maintain or increase current military spending; only 32 percent want to reduce it. Americans have more confidence in the military than in any other institution, including organized religion. It is true that the electorate's views can change and that many voters respect a candidate who stays true to his or her ideals rather than chasing public opinion, as Clinton seems to. It's also true that Republicans will attack any Democratic candidate as a quasi-treasonous weakling. ""I remember 2004 very clearly,"" the historian Rick Perlstein tells me. ""The reason that John Kerry was supposed to be the perfect candidate was because he was unattackable. Because he was a war hero. It was wishful thinking. He was attacked, and quite effectively."" As we've seen with Barack Obama, Republicans will call any Democrat a socialist. Still, it doesn't follow that actually being a socialist is not an electoral liability. In June 2015, Gallup polled American voters about the sort of people they would and would not support for president. Eight percent would not vote for a woman. Thirty-eight percent would not vote for a Muslim, and 40 percent would not vote for an atheist. Fifty percent would not vote for a socialist; it was the most negatively viewed characteristic in the survey. A Sanders backer might retort that the candidate's socialism is well-known and that he nevertheless has consistently high approval ratings. It is certainly possible that Cold War categories have lost their salience in American politics, and it is undeniable that many Americans are sympathetic to Sanders' proposals. One poll found that more than half of respondents like the idea of Medicare for all, a cornerstone of Sanders' campaign. Another found that 63 percent of Americans support raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, which Sanders is calling for. There is strong majority support for breaking up the big banks. We simply don't know, however, whether this means socialism itself is losing its stigma. Sanders' approval ratings may be misleading, because the majority of voters don't have a fully formed idea of him or his political history. Most people don't pay that much attention to politics; a recent poll found that a third of Americans didn't know who Antonin Scalia was. So-called swing voters are particularly disconnected, since people who follow politics closely tend to have strong opinions about the two parties. Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University, says research suggests that about 10 percent of the electorate was undecided or persuadable in the runup to the 2012 election. ""These are folks who tend to be less interested, less tuned in to the campaign,"" he says. ""These are not the good democratic citizens who are really trying to weigh their options. These are people who are really kind of out of it."" They may thus be particularly susceptible to demagoguery. And it's all too easy to imagine how gleefully Republicans would exploit Sanders' youthful opposition to the CIA and his anti-military leanings if he were to be the nominee. In a time of widespread panic about terrorism, the attack ads write themselves. That is why, as someone who is broadly sympathetic to Sanders' politics but terrified by the prospect of his nomination, I've struggled over how to write about his radical past. To fret about it seems like concern-trolling. It means assuming that voters whose lives and worldviews are remote from mine will be scandalized by a history that doesn't bother me much at all. This posture may be elitist and condescending. The question is whether that makes it wrong. Read more Slate coverage of the Democratic primary."	Does Bernie Sanders' Radical Past Matter?

Packed into the ballroom of the Treasure Island Casino, hundreds of people--many of them clad in Trump gear or waving American flags--cheered and chanted for the real estate mogul as they drank from the cash bar and waited to hear results for the Nevada Republican Caucus. ""Let's make America great again,"" said Dane Senser, an older man wearing a Trump hat and cradling a Budweiser. ""It's simple, but it's true. This is a great country and there are great people. We are the greatest country in the world, let's be proud of it, let's not be embarrassed about it."" For Senser, Trump is an aspirational figure, someone who can give America the backbone it needs to succeed. ""He will inspire people, and that's what the country needs right now."" It seems Nevada Republicans agreed. Marco Rubio was backed by the state's political establishment, and Ted Cruz made headway with religious voters, but overwhelmingly--like their counterparts in New Hampshire and South Carolina--Republican voters flocked to the former reality TV star and his promise to ""make America great again."" Turnout blew past expectations, and voters crowded caucus sites--throwing the process into chaos in some precincts--to cast a ballot for the billionaire. Trump was winning handily with more than 45 percent of the vote and nearly 90 percent of the results counted, to about 23 percent for Rubio and about 22 percent for Cruz. Trump won with every demographic, exceeding Cruz with evangelicals and beating Rubio with more moderate Republicans. It was a complete rout, and once again, Trump showed he was the only candidate with a coalition that can carry him through the entire primary, bringing working-class whites together with conservative evangelicals and Republican moderates. Indeed, Trump is poised to dominate in next week's Super Tuesday primaries, where he leads in eight of the 12 contests. By this time next week, Trump could have a commanding lead in votes and delegates. And while it's possible that this slips away in the face of party opposition, it's unlikely. The last presidential candidate--in either party--to win the nomination without winning an early state was Bill Clinton in 1992. But there's a critical difference between then and now. The early states were split at the time between multiple candidates, giving Clinton the space to build consecutive wins after faltering early on. Trump has been the consecutive winner in this primary, which gives him a powerful advantage. Or, put simply, Donald Trump is the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination. Period. Yes, Rubio is the favorite of the GOP establishment and Cruz is the candidate of conservative activists, but neither is close to overcoming Trump or turning this multi-candidate race into a one-on-one contest. Absent a major shift in the primary, Trump will reach escape velocity, and for the first time in the modern era, a genuine outsider will win a major party nomination, throwing his host--the Republican Party--into complete disarray. Or, as former Cruz spokeswoman Amanda Carpenter said on CNN on Tuesday night, ""I'm really struck in thinking about what a Donald Trump nomination would actually mean. I really think it's the end of the Republican party."" Trump's supporters aren't shy with praise for the real estate mogul. They praise him for being a businessman; they praise him for talking tough to countries like China and Mexico; they praise him for voicing his mind and ""saying what we're all thinking,"" as several people voiced it to me Tuesday evening. What Trump wants to do--his policies, his plans, his proposals--is less important than who he is, a self-proclaimed avatar of national strength. This gets to something important about Trump's appeal. Trump is a classic authoritarian. ""What do we all want?"" he asked at Monday's rally. ""We want security. We want a strong country."" Critically, his voters are authoritarians too. As pollster Matthew MacWilliams described it in Vox, ""A voter's gender, education, age, ideology, party identification, income, and race simply had no statistical bearing on whether someone supported Trump."" What matters, instead, is voter authoritarianism. ""People who score high on the authoritarian scale value conformity and order, protect social norms, and are wary of outsiders. And when authoritarians feel threatened, they support aggressive leaders and policies,"" he writes. More than anything, it's clear Trump wants his supporters to be afraid. He wants them to fear immigrants, to fear Muslims, to fear anyone who might be an outsider. But what's just as important is that Trump voters are actually afraid. They are fearful for the country, and they see Trump as someone who can protect them. And given Trump's position in the primary, their fear may take him all the way to the prize.

17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/twitter_commentary_about_the_nevada_gop_caucus.html	Nevada voters will caucus Tuesday evening to determine how the state's 30 delegates will be allocated among the narrowing Republican presidential field. Donald Trump has a 20-point lead over any other contender in FiveThirtyEight's weighted poll estimates, and the race is close between Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio for second place. The caucus will be the first contest since Jeb Bush dropped out of the race after placing fourth in the South Carolina primary. One poll suggests that former Bush supporters will disproportionately vote for Rubio but not by nearly enough of a margin to let the Florida senator overtake Trump. Now you can watch the spin in real time as the primary results trickle in from Nevada. Below, you'll see left-leaning commentators on the left and right-leaning commentators on the right. Let the spin begin! See more of Slate's coverage of the GOP presidential primary.	What Twitter Pundits Have to Say About the Nevada GOP Caucus
18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/marco_rubio_is_attacking_ted_cruz_instead_of_donald_trump_big_mistake.html	"Watch the closing note of Marco Rubio's campaign in South Carolina, and you can see how he wins a general election. There, he stood with the state's South Asian governor, Nikki Haley, and its black senator, Tim Scott, to declare that ""the children of the Reagan Revolution are ready to assume the mantle of leadership."" It was picture perfect, three diverse candidates standing for a future, multiracial Republican Party. And it's easy to see how this vision appeals to millions of moderate American voters who want to affirm their tolerance and cosmpolitan beliefs, especially when coupled with Rubio's upbeat and largely forward-looking rhetoric (meant to obscure 2002-vintage policies). ""We are a nation and a people that celebrates success,"" said Rubio in that South Carolina speech. ""We are a nation that admires people that have worked hard and moved ahead."" But to get to the general election, Marco Rubio has to win the Republican primary. And it's much harder to see how he gets from here--a third-place finish in Iowa, a fifth-place finish in New Hampshire, and a second-place finish in South Carolina--to there. The largest obstacle, the force that's dominated the race for months, stretching back to last summer, is Donald Trump. If we're judging by votes and victories, Trump is the front-runner for the nomination. He holds the most wins (New Hampshire, South Carolina, and probably Nevada), he holds the most delegates, and he has the broadest coalition. As the Atlantic's Ronald Brownstein shows in his analysis of the vote in South Carolina, Trump won 33 percent of independents and 32 percent of self-identified Republicans. He carried 33 percent of evangelicals and 42 percent of voters without a college degree. The same goes for his ideological coalition, which was almost evenly split between very conservative voters, somewhat conservative voters, and moderates. Trump stands from a position of strength. He holds the keys to the nomination. But Rubio isn't going after Trump, his chief competitor. He's going after Ted Cruz, knocking the Texas senator for running a ""dishonest campaign."" Likewise, Cruz clearly sees Rubio as his chief competitor, attacking his Florida colleague from the right on immigration and portraying him as a devoted ally of President Obama. All of this despite the fact that neither Cruz nor Rubio is each other's chief threat. Trump is. Trump prevents Cruz from consolidating conservative and disaffected voters while he also keeps Rubio from consolidating more moderate Republicans. In other words, as long as Rubio and Cruz are skirmishing against each other--dividing any potential anti-Trump coalition--the structure of the primary and the calendar of the remaining contests favor Trump. To that point, the multistate primaries of Super Tuesday next week are centered in the South, where Trump could dominate the field on the strength of his support from white evangelicals and working-class Republicans. For Cruz in particular, South Carolina made it clear that he has to go after Trump. But he refuses. At a campaign appearance at the Durango Hills Community Center in Las Vegas on Monday, Cruz took a small swipe at Trump--mocking the real estate mogul's claim that he would ""make America great again"" by noting the emptiness of the promise--but quickly pivoted back to touting his conservative bona fides. This gets to a fact of the entire Republican field. Now that Jeb Bush has left the contest, everyone in the race is more focused on someone other than Trump. It's as if the GOP's traditional candidates are in denial about the state of the party's primary, as though they don't believe that Trump could win the nomination outright. It's the same mistake that Republicans made throughout 2015, when Trump gained steam and GOP elites refused to confront him. The fact, however, is that absent a concerted effort against the front-runner, each candidate is just running for second place. Rubio may talk like a winner after placing second or third, but even gifted politicians can't win party nominations when they lose primaries. At a certain point, the granular strategizing that defines each of the non-Trump efforts has to end. Rubio and Cruz and John Kasich and even Ben Carson have to focus on Donald Trump if they have any interest in winning. In that sense, Nevada is a test of their appetite for combat. So far, no one seems hungry for a fight. Read more Slate coverage of the GOP primary."	Rubio Is Letting Trump Win the GOP Nomination Without a Fight
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/mike_murphy_did_not_ruin_jeb_bush_s_campaign.html	"Jeb Bush lost the Republican nomination because he was the wrong candidate in the wrong cycle. But still, the search for a scapegoat has commenced. What went wrong with Jeb's campaign? According to the stories out since Bush's exit from the race, filled with anonymous nuggets from political consultants who failed, the fault lies with some other political consultant who failed more. These stories are always amusing in the narrowness they're trying to sell. We're led to believe, for example, that the Bush juggernaut somehow went nowhere because one Bush adviser, Sally Bradshaw, was too protective of Bush or whatever. It was her fault! Had she acted in a more forthright manner toward her employer, he would be skipping jubilantly to the nomination right now. If Sally Bradshaw is the ludicrous scapegoat for a collective failed effort on the inside, Mike Murphy is the go-to outside man to blame. Murphy, the head of Bush's big-spending, nine-digit super PAC, Right to Rise, is being pummeled in predictable fashion right now by angry donors and others looking to cover their hides. It's true that the longtime political consultant has found a knack in recent years for sidling up to whales. He was a lead strategist for former eBay CEO Meg Whitman's failed $177 million bid for governor of California in 2010--another case in which a candidate obviously wasn't going to win but decided to burn vast sums of cash anyway. How much did Murphy get paid on commission in the great Bush money bonfire? ""One Bush bundler"" tells CNN that the figure was ""a minimum of $14 million."" Murphy's compensation is not publicly known, though, and he has responded to that estimation as ""absolute bullshit."" Still, Murphy's commission was likely disproportionate to his candidate's performance, so long as he was paid above California's minimum wage. But why did Murphy have all of this money in the first place? Because rich people gave it to him. Correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I know, there are no federal, state, or municipal laws that required these people to donate five- to eight-figure sums to Jeb Bush's super PAC. So before these donors blame Murphy for blowing their money, perhaps they should blame themselves for not doing the requisite investment research. These donors were the ones who decided to open up their wallets for the Jeb campaign without requiring the candidate--who last ran for political office in 2002--to prove himself. I get where they were coming from. Recent Republican presidential history suggests that voters usually grant the nomination to the center-right guy whose ""turn"" it is, and it was Bush's turn. He was a popular former governor of Florida and a Bush, and Bushes are supposed to win nominations. Other candidates would cower at his sight and clear the field for fear of retribution. These are things that Murphy, the donors, Republican operatives, Bush himself, and us dolts in the media tended to believe. It didn't happen, for a set of factors that are mostly beyond any individual's control. Bush was an unpersuasive candidate to an electorate that was never open to his persuasions. That's all it is, and none of Murphy's ads could change that. If the conventional wisdom becomes that Bush's failure was one ineffective consultant's fault, that sets up rich people to make the same expensive mistake again with a different consultant, which would be funny. But if donors never subject a potential candidate to a ""hazing trial to test skill and stability"" before throwing burlap sacks of cash in his direction, they don't have much to complain about.

20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/jeb_bush_was_not_a_joke.html	"On the eve of the election, Slate's revisiting our best stories from the campaign. How did we get here? Read on. Jeb Bush's extremely bad week began last Monday evening in the Charleston Convention Center. Facing anemic poll numbers and dwindling campaign cash, he needed something big. And so--before a couple thousand South Carolinians, a bank of news cameras, and a flock of reporters who flapped in like vultures placidly eyeing a wounded animal--he deployed his final line of defense: his big brother. There was good ol' Dubya, moseying out to raucous applause. The Decider is edging up on 70 now, exhibiting far less hair and notably slurrier diction. But durned if he didn't unholster that squinty-eyed, chest-forward 'tude that the folks still love. There were shouts of ""We miss you!"" as he spoke. George praised his little bro's ""humility"" and ""quiet conviction."" He reminded us that ""the strongest person usually isn't the loudest in the room."" As introductions go, it was nigh apologetic--like Eeyore was about to step to the lectern. But the Jeb who took the stage was pumped. He boomed at the mic, opening with a dramatic warning that our world was being ""turned asunder."" Jeb had seen an optometrist earlier that day, ditching his doofusy glasses for contact lenses. He'd adios'd his quarter-zip dad sweater in favor of a suit and tie. He was sporting a slicker haircut. He'd pulled out all the stops. It sure felt like a last stand. Not just for Jeb Bush's campaign, but maybe for Jeb Bush's basic dignity as a human being. For the tattered legacy of the Bush family. For the remnants of an embattled GOP faction. Even, one might argue, for the quaint notion of civility in public life. Anyway, none of it worked. I saw people leaving once Dubya was done, and after it became clear that Laura Bush, also sitting on stage, wouldn't be speaking. They stepped on discarded ""Jeb!"" placards as they headed for the exits. By Wednesday afternoon, after this desperate kick for the surface, Jeb's campaign was sinking to previously uncharted depths. Around the same moment that popular South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley was endorsing Marco Rubio, Jeb was addressing a modest gathering inside a gazebo at the Summerville Country Club, a little inland from Charleston. Things quickly went to a very sad place. By the time the event was over, multiple attendees had expressed their sympathy for Jeb--how sorry they were that he'd failed to stop Donald Trump from stealing his lunch money. ""I loved your brother. Can you be in that category?"" inquired an older man, rather doubtfully. ""Can you be a sumbitch?"" ""I will be tough. I will be resolute. I will be firm. I will be clear. I will be determined,"" Jeb answered. He rattled it off with that low-key affect of his, standing about 30 yards from the tee box on the sixth hole of a golf course. It was the least sumbitchy thing you ever saw in your life. At one point, Jeb unleashed a bitter rant. ""It's all been decided, apparently,"" he said. ""The pundits have decided. We don't have to go vote, I guess. I should just stop campaigning, maybe?"" ""No, no,"" a few people in one corner said. By Saturday night, it was all over but the crying. And then the crying happened, too. Standing in front of volunteers in a small function room at the Columbia Hilton, Jeb choked up as he announced he was suspending his campaign. People in the crowd dabbed at their eyes. I asked a man with a ""Jeb!"" sticker on his blazer lapel if he was surprised that Jeb had quit the race. ""I'm not surprised that Jeb Bush was a statesman to the end,"" he said, defiance in his voice. ""The Republican Party may have moved, but Jeb Bush hasn't."" And that, I think, was his virtue and his downfall. * * * I never expected to like Jeb. Boarding school toff. Political scion. Staunch pro-lifer. NRA favorite. Oh, and ugh, the Terri Schiavo stuff. Still, I couldn't help but warm to him as the campaign wore on. And then even pull for him, a little. It was partly the pathos. Jeb felt somehow more human than other candidates. Vulnerable, struggling, unable to conceal flashes of fear and melancholy. He also showed compassion on the trail. Take this, from a British journalist who, for unclear reasons, felt compelled to stand up at Jeb's event in Greenville on Friday and say this: ""My job as a columnist is to follow these rallies. I haven't heard any other candidate give a long period in their speech to talking about people with learning disabilities, to talk about people at the bottom of the pack. And whatever happens to your campaign, sir, that heart you should be really proud of."" I concur, randomly effusive British journalist. But what sealed it for me was Jeb's backbone. You heard me right: Poor, sweet, pitiful Jeb was the one guy with spine. The only GOP candidate who made it a point to denounce Trump's worst barbarities. I watched him do it again and again on the trail. ""He's entertaining,"" he'd say of Trump, ""unless you're a woman, or Hispanic, or a disabled person. But it's not so entertaining when you get disparaged."" Or: ""It's not strong to denigrate people. It's a sign of weakness."" Of course, those should be obvious sentiments. Any good-hearted fourth-grader knows as much. And yet Jeb stood alone among his colleagues, shouting, ""You can't insult your way to the nomination!"" into a pitiless void. The other guys allowed--and continue to allow--Trump's vile hate to go unchallenged. ""The country is angry,"" they say. They ought to be ashamed of themselves. * * * Jeb had all manner of deficiencies as a candidate. Among them, as so often is the case with tragic protagonists, his own family. Third time was not the charm. ""Bush fatigue"" was a major stumbling block. It's a little unfair to tar Jeb with the sins of his brother when they're so unalike. As Dubya spoke in Charleston last week, he carefully painted Jeb as the beta sibling. Dubya reminisced about sitting in the stands with Jeb at Astros games when they were younger: George would watch the action on the field while Jeb would be ""writing love letters to his future wife."" The two men's grandkids have bestowed on them different, and telling, nicknames: ""Jeb is 'Gampy' and I'm 'El Jefe,' "" said Dubya with that staccato chortle. ""In case you're not bilingual, that means 'the boss.' "" Jeb might have more of his father in him. The WASPy reserve. The considered restraint--a quality that Newsweek, back in 1987, labeled the ""Wimp Factor."" But Jeb has never shown Poppy's killer instinct. Former Slate editor Michael Kinsley once termed G.H.W. a ""grandee with a switchblade."" You don't get the sense Jeb is keen to shiv anyone. Along with Bush money and Bush connections, Jeb also inherited the Bushian infelicity with language. Not once have I seen him make it through a speech without mangling some phrase or stumbling on his words. Likewise, he's burdened with the Bush men's awkward sense of humor. His jokes rarely land. The albatross of his family aside, this was never going to be Jeb's election cycle. He's far too temperate. His stump speech promised a ""steady hand"" at a time when there's zero demand for steady hands. To get traction in 2016, you gotta pledge to burn the whole mofo down. Even within the ""establishment lane,"" Jeb was especially ill-suited to our moment. Go ahead, feast your eyes on Rubio and Haley--a pair of attractive, multiculti 44-year-olds who resemble ""a Benetton commercial."" Now direct your gaze to pasty, 63-year-old Jeb--campaigning not with Nikki Haley but with Lindsey Graham and a couple of wrinkled Navy admirals. Jeb was saddled with a surname, a team of advisers, and a policy slate that all smelled like yesterday's fish. To the extent that he's a guy who thrived in a previous era, awoke to a new epoch that rejects him, and needed radical retraining to get the job he wanted, Jeb's not unlike those left-behind Trump voters we keep hearing about. Another outmoded white dude. * * * There I go again, letting Trump dominate the conversation. ""The front-runner,"" as Jeb called him on the stump--skirting proper nouns as though Trump were Voldemort--looms over all. But if there's a single person who's suffered most under the Donald's vicious reign--I'm not talking about poll results, but personally, emotionally--that person has to be Jeb. It was painful to witness. A sort of atavistic predator-prey relationship. Trump would pin Jeb down, toy with his quarry, flay the skin off piece by piece. Watching Jeb on the debate stage, I could feel the prickly heat bloom across his nape whenever Trump attacked. Jeb would rock back and forth, his shoulders bobbing, an awkward rictus grin spreading across his face. I'm quite familiar with these involuntary responses. I, too, am a man deeply averse to conflict. I spotted Jeb as a fellow introvert right from the start. Shy recognize shy. It must have been a singular torture to campaign for president with this personality suite. Jeb can't saber-rattle like his brother. He can't cornpone like Lindsey Graham. His battle with Trump was a classic clash of phlegmatic versus choleric--never a winning matchup for the quiet guy. ""Introverts grind. They set goals,"" said Jeb at a town hall in Columbia Thursday night, when asked if his ailment had a silver lining. ""Introverts like to listen,"" he added. Every profile of Jeb notes how comfortable he is in smaller settings, soaking up information, diving into nitty-gritty details. A voter in the audience at the Summerville event--a disabled veteran--stood up and described a meeting he had with Jeb and other wounded vets a few years ago. ""I was so impressed,"" he said, with evident gratitude, ""because you took out a pen and notebook and just listened for three hours. I don't think any other candidate would do that."" You can't deny his rigor. He produced a 47-page policy pamphlet that he called ""the short version."" He could discuss ""recourse debt"" and ""forbearance rates"" when asked about student loans. When one voter mentioned that she had a special-needs child, Jeb spoke with tremendous passion and fluency about educational solutions for developmentally disabled kids. Please recall that Trump mocked a disabled man by making gimpy arm motions. * * * Last week, after Jeb's Myrtle Beach event ended, I went around asking attendees if they'd been won over. There was general assent that Jeb was ""a good man."" But multiple people said they were still leaning toward Rubio or Kasich. One woman confessed that she wasn't a Republican voter at all. She just wanted to scope out the GOP candidates who came through town, in case any reached the White House. I asked her which one of them she'd choose, if forced. ""Probably him,"" she said, nodding toward the scrum of people taking selfies with Jeb. As she said it, I realized I felt the same way. Look, I know he wanted to eliminate the estate tax. I know his brother was an awful president, and I know he was a terrible candidate. But it's a shame that we caricaturized him out of existence this past year. He's more than his unfortunate exclamation point. He's not a walking sad-face emoji. Given that the president serves as an avatar for our nation--the face we show the world, the mirror that reflects who we are--integrity in a candidate is no small thing. Earnest attention to detail is to be applauded. Willingness to listen is a mark of solid judgment. Empathy for the afflicted bespeaks good character. Shit matters, is I guess what I'm saying. The Republican race snipped its strongest tether to decency when Jeb Bush bowed out Saturday night. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Jeb Bush Was Not a Joke
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/barring_a_catastrophe_hillary_clinton_s_nomination_is_inevitable_again.html	"Before the New Hampshire primary earlier this month, it was assumed that the Nevada caucus was going to be a victory for Hillary Clinton. She had strong outreach to the state's Latino and black voters; she had endorsements and support from key figures in the state; and she had her campaign manager, Robby Mook, who cut his teeth organizing the state for the first Clinton campaign in 2008, when she beat Barack Obama there. But then New Hampshire came, Bernie Sanders scored a lopsided win over Clinton, and the Vermont senator channeled that victory into an unprecedented burst of fundraising. He didn't just have momentum--he was putting money and people into Nevada, the third state on the Democratic nominating calendar after Iowa and New Hampshire, and expanding his outreach to Latino voters. Suddenly, Nevada was in doubt. So much so that Mook issued a memo downplaying Nevada, focusing on South Carolina, and looking forward to the next swath of contests in March. It turned out that all of this was unnecessary. On Saturday, Clinton won the Nevada caucuses by a comfortable margin of around 5 points. Yes, the Sanders campaign had made up ground on Clinton, who he noted in his concession speech led him by as many as 25 points in polling in Nevada last month. But that comeback effort wasn't fast enough to overcome her built-in advantages and deny her a victory. ""The truth is, we aren't a single issue country"" Clinton said in her victory speech, hammering on her most recent line against Sanders. ""We need more than a plan for the big banks."" By winning, Team Clinton doesn't just score delegates--it proves its theory of the race. The Clinton campaign believes that Sanders' strength and enthusiasm is illusory; that it reflects the peculiar demographics of Iowa and New Hampshire--rural states with few minorities--more than any pro-Bernie tide in the Democratic Party. Nevada, in other words, was a test. If Clinton lost, then it presaged a tighter race in South Carolina and beyond, and possibly one that ended with a Sanders nomination. Now, instead, we have a race that essentially looks like it did in the beginning of the year. Clinton has the advantage, and barring a catastrophic decline with black voters, she'll march steadily to the nomination. This doesn't mean the campaign is over. Sanders is still a formidable candidate. He will win additional contests and demonstrate the extent to which he--or at least, his ideology--is the future of the Democratic Party. To that point, Sanders continues to excel with young voters, including non-whites. In exit polls, Sanders won 68 percent of non-white voters under 45. Clinton will continue to have to respond to Sanders' challenge and reach out to these supporters. Despite a clearer path to the nomination, she cannot be complacent. In all likelihood, this primary season will end with a Clinton who has moved even further to the left, adopting some of Sanders' approach and even his rhetoric. And there's still the question of turnout. Going by early returns, Nevada will be the third state where Democrats have underperformed relative to 2008. Those numbers don't bode well for the party's general election turnout effort, where Democrats will need to reach every possible supporter to hold onto the White House for a third term and claim a victory that would be necessary to preserve President Obama's chief accomplishments from the last two. But the uncertainty that has defined the race since New Hampshire is over for the time being. Clinton still has her advantage with black and Latino voters, and in a Democratic primary, that is dispositive. Next is South Carolina, and there she will almost certainly score another victory, followed by wins in the Southern and Western states that follow in March. Nevada was just the win that Clinton needed. Now that she has it, her road ahead looks more stable and steady.

22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/south_carolina_s_primaries_aren_t_as_nasty_as_the_once_were.html	"GREENVILLE, S.C.--""When you come to South Carolina, it's a blood sport. Politics is a blood sport."" South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley was speaking with reporters Thursday morning alongside her new presidential endorsee, Sen. Marco Rubio, about whether the campaign in her state had gotten too nasty. ""I wear heels,"" she continued, ""it's not for a fashion statement. It's because you've got to be prepared to kick at any time."" This is presumably a line she's delivered 10 million times. But it earned its share of chortles from the assembled national press corps in Anderson, South Carolina, just outside Greenville in the state's conservative northwest corner. Behind every media story about dirty tricks in South Carolina politics is a not-so-secret wish: Please, please get nasty and dirty and immoral. Bury this presidential contest in filth, as you always do, you beautifully disgusting people. There's the natural instinct to portray any middling criticism lobbied at a candidate as ""classic South Carolina,"" just because it fits into a pre-set narrative about wily Southern tricksters. But has anything been unusually depraved this time around? Nothing has come anywhere near the go-to example of the whisper campaign that buried an insurgent Sen. John McCain here in 2000. Or the (unsuccessful) rumormongering effort against Haley herself in 2010. There's still another week to go before the Democrats vote in South Carolina, but so far, the Hillary Clinton campaign has not been shopping around photos of Sen. Bernie Sanders in a turban. You know, the really nasty stuff that no one can condone ... but secretly hopes for anyway. Not that the candidates have been engaged in a lovefest. The crossfire is rapid and consistent. But mostly it comes in the form of pathetic whining about mailers or websites or advertisements that, while stupid, aren't anything unusual. Rubio met with the press Thursday morning for a couple of reasons. The first was to show off Haley, whose endorsement he hopes can catapult him above Sen. Ted Cruz for second place Saturday. (Rep. Trey Gowdy and Sen. Tim Scott, the other members of Rubio's potent South Carolina endorsement troika, milled about in a corner while the press engaged Rubio and Haley.) Another reason was to whine about Cruz's latest unconscionable deed: a Cruz-backed website--""The Real Rubio Record""--that used a photoshopped image of ""Marco Rubio"" and ""Barack Obama"" yukkin' it up and shaking hands after consummating the ""Rubio-Obama Trade Pact,"" for which Rubio allegedly provided the clinching vote. Most sinisterly, Rubio--a right-hander--is shaking the left-handed Obama with his left hand, a sign of deferential weakness and conspiracy. Rubio was so upset about this image that he had his adviser, Todd Harris, show it off to the press following an early rally at a CrossFit in Greenville. ""This is how phony and how deceitful the Cruz campaign has become,"" Harris said, in pure disbelief that the Cruz campaign would dare imply that Obama and Rubio have shaken hands. ""It's not real. The picture's fake, it's a photoshop of someone else shaking hands--and it appears it isn't Barack Obama either,"" Rubio said in Anderson. ""So I think now this is a disturbing pattern, guys. It's a disturbing pattern. Everyday they're making things up--in this case they literally made up a picture."" Literally made up a picture. To illustrate a point on a website. Rubio then pivoted to the much more substantial point that Cruz, himself, flip-flopped on granting Obama Trade Promotion Authority--aka the ""Rubio-Obama Trade Pact."" (There's a substantial amount of hatred for globalization among the rank-and-file in this part of upstate South Carolina, even though it's home to a massive, job-creating BMW facility that seems to span half of the I-85 corridor between Greenville and Spartanburg.) ""They literally made up a picture,"" Rubio reiterated. Rubio almost solely complains about how dirty Cruz is. His base doesn't overlap much with Donald Trump's, and the two leave each other alone. Cruz's base, however, overlaps with both Trump's and Rubio's, and so he has to fight a two-front war. Not that he doesn't enjoy the challenge. Much like Rubio is aghast at how Cruz's malevolent campaign would use a photo illustration on a website, Cruz is stunned at how nastily the campaigns of both Trump and Rubio have turned on him. ""Marco Rubio is behaving like Donald Trump with a smile,"" Cruz said Wednesday morning in Seneca, near Clemson. The main purpose of his event was to mock a cease-and-desist letter that ""Donald's lawyer"" had sent Cruz's campaign to block the airing of a very non-defamatory political ad. But Cruz devoted the second half to bundling Rubio with Trump. ""At the debate, I made three points about Marco's record on immigration,"" Cruz went on. ""And Marco's response was exactly the same as Donald's: It was to yell, 'liar, liar, liar.' "" Cruz likes to mention that he, despite their many disagreements, has never impugned the personal character of a fellow senator. This itself is untrue. Another issue that the two have been bickering about is push polls, also known as ""calls."" Both Trump and Rubio have accused Cruz of push polls that, again, just level the usual criticisms that Cruz always makes in plain daylight about Rubio and Trump. Cruz has denied having anything to do with them, which may be true in the narrowest legal sense. Cruz insists that the real candidate commissioning the ghastly push polls is Rubio, whose push polls falsely attribute nasty push polls to Cruz. ""And yet Marco, his campaign, sent out 500,000 robocalls with a major campaign surrogate of his accusing our campaign of being behind the push polls,"" Cruz said. ""He was asked today what evidence he had for that. He had no evidence. He had no basis whatsoever."" Cruz said he understood that the Rubio campaign is disappointed, but campaigns have to be about ""ethics,"" and passing along talking points via telephone calls is simply a bridge too far. Ads that show old clips? Websites with illustrations? Robocalls? None of this stuff is what we expect of South Carolina. Where are the illegitimate minority children, the tawdry affairs--the fabricated, humiliating, and typically prejudiced rumors that campaign personnel distribute to shady, pseudonymous ""fixers"" with the instructions: Our fingerprints can't be on this. Understood? The nastiest player in the South Carolina primary so far has been Pope Francis. Declaring that Trump isn't a Christian, ahead of a Southern Republican primary? Now we're getting somewhere. If Pope Francis could expand this into an allegation that Trump has Muslim children out of wedlock who recently joined ISIS, then we'd be rolling. Trump did not mention the pope's comments during his Thursday afternoon rally at Gaffney's Broad River Electric Cooperative. (""Do we love electricity?"" Trump said upon taking the stage. ""How about life without electricity? Not so good, right? Not so good."") Perhaps it was just too late in the day to get into it with a pontiff. Had he chosen to, though, he may have found a receptive audience. ""I don't have a lot of use for the pope,"" said Diane Cannady, a Trump supporter from Fort Mill. ""To me, he's just another man."" Thurman Davis, from Blacksburg, supports Trump because, ""in my opinion, he's the only one who loves America. This is my country and I want my kids to have a good future."" He added that ""in my opinion--don't get me wrong--I lived in Florida and I went to school with a very large Mexican population. And I love the people. But I don't think we should roll the red carpet out for them and let them be as I am."" He supports the wall. When asked about the pope's comments--that people who think in terms of building walls are not real Christians--Davis turned around to display the embroidery on the back of his jacket. It read: ""JESUS FOREVER."" Trump himself has an interesting relationship with ""nastiness."" It's a quality he seems to despise in his competitors but thrusts forth as a central reason for his own candidacy. At one point during his speech, Trump openly accepted the mantle of nastiness. ""We've got to be nasty, folks,"" he said, mocking the pundits who thought he came across as too ""nasty"" in the last debate. ""Can I be nasty? Oh, we're gonna be so nasty. ISIS is not going to like us anymore. ISIS is going to be not so happy, folks."" When it came to the other candidates, though, Trump used ""nasty"" in its more traditional, negatively connoted form. He disparaged ""this guy Jeb Bush--who's got zero chance, by the way, zero chance of winning"" as a ""nasty guy, you know, in his own way, he's a nasty guy"" for spending so much money on negative ads in New Hampshire. ""And they're not even correct,"" he continued. ""At least get them correct."" He briefly second-guessed himself: ""Although maybe I'm better off if they're not correct, my polls go up every time he plays the ad, so I don't know."" Extended spiels about Cruz's dishonesty have become as regular a part of Trump's speeches as the appetizer course of poll readings and the scattered asides about how pathetic Bush is. Cruz ""lies, he lies badly,"" Trump said to cheers. ""You know, he holds up his Bible and then he lies--let me tell ya, that guy lies. He is a liar."" Trump insisted that he ""doesn't say that easily--and I know the difference between having fun and playing the game, and, ya know, we're in politics--but I know the difference between that and lying."" He mocked Cruz's voice saying, Donald Trump doesn't like the Second Amendment. ""I'm the strongest person on the Second Amendment--like, by far!"" None of this--either Trump's labeling of Cruz as a ""liar,"" or Cruz saying that Trump is soft on the Second Amendment and other issues, like abortion--would fall into the category of ""dirty tricks"" or a ""Southern mud fight"" or whatever other fantastical terms are thrown about around the South Carolina primary. It's just the normal sort of back-and-forth that happens in the closing stage of a primary. The large field ensures that the volleys are more frequent, but the projectiles themselves couldn't be smaller. It's not nasty, and it's not dirty. It's just puerile white noise."	South Carolina Politics Just Got Boring. Where Are All the Dirty Tricks?

After facing hostile questions from Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski Wednesday night--they comprehensively laid out his flip-flops, presented him with damning videotape, and asked him to explain the inconsistencies in detail--Trump was confronted by hostile audience members at MSNBC's televised town-hall forum. When a Muslim questioner got up to ask why he had said such bigoted things about minorities, Trump seemed to struggle while Scarborough forced him to respond. The candidate looked uncomfortable, unhappy, and somewhat lost. It could be a turning point. If only. Of course, none of this actually occurred Wednesday night, just like it hasn't occurred once this entire campaign season. Instead, Scarborough and Brzezinski hosted what appeared to be a rehearsed and ""safe"" town hall, in which American voters asked the candidate such hard-hitting questions as ""Why did you decide to run for president?"" and ""how will you set yourself apart"" from other Republicans? It was completely worthless television, except in one sense: The program highlighted the many ways in which the media's coverage of Trump has been soft, insufficient, and without substance. Scarborough began the evening by noting that he and his co-host were prepared to debrief Trump and ask him important questions; instead, the questions were mild, and the follow-ups nonexistent. It remains shocking that after months of bigoted comments and almost pathological dishonesty, Trump still lands these types of interviews. Wednesday night, there was no mention of his racist comments toward Mexicans; his praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin; or his stigmatization of Muslims. He wasn't pressed hard for any policy details, nor challenged about his well-catalogued dislike of the truth. Scarborough began by asking about--what else--polls, before ostensibly turning to the Supreme Court. After asking one question about the Second Amendment, which Trump dodged, Scarborough moved on. (Scarborough's constant grinning at Trump's laughable dishonesty was the only suggestion that the host recognized the nonsense Trump was spewing; he simply didn't care.) When Scarborough had a chance to follow-up on Trump's nonsensical answers--guns, health care, etc.--he usually just changed the subject. Scarborough fared slightly better when the discussion moved to Iraq; he briefly focused on Trump's continued (and unproven) claims about opposing the war before it began. But then the questioning was turned over to the audience--Brzezinski was basically superfluous--with the first question going to a woman claiming to be a Democrat who had nonetheless learned a lot from Trump's great business teachings. Terrific. If the softball questions weren't enough to make you feel like you were watching a rigged entertainment program, everything else about Wednesday night's event also had a ring of cynicism to it. CNN was hosting a ""town hall"" in South Carolina with several of the other candidates, and MSNBC clearly wanted to compete. They did so by managing to get the biggest ratings draw in the race to appear with his favorite hosts. (Trump often appears on Morning Joe.) It's true that there have been moments when Trump and Scarborough have gotten tense with each other, but it has always been papered over, presumably because it's in both of their interests. MSNBC has certainly not been uniformly easy on Trump, especially during its evening programs. But the networks' reliance on his ratings--a problem that is especially acute at CNN--means that they need to maintain a certain amount of politeness when dealing with the real estate magnate. If there is one takeaway, it's that the media's relationship with Trump should worry Hillary Clinton, assuming each of them vanquishes their primary opponents. I would have said six months ago, perhaps naively, that a blatantly bigoted candidate would face such a sustained media firestorm (especially in liberal precincts) that he would be incapable of getting elected. That's not yet the case. Indeed, there are no signs that the media's sick, interminable honeymoon with Trump will come to an end anytime soon. Which means that rather than witnessing the beginning of the end of Donald Trump's time in the political spotlight, we may not even be at the end of the beginning.

What follows is the transcript for Episode 36, in which Slate's Dahlia Lithwick discusses the great effect this presidential election will likely have on the composition of the Supreme Court. Any changes to the SCOTUS justice lineup are sure to carry consequences for the lives of everyday Americans, and multiple new appointments now seem especially likely in the next two presidential terms. Why then have the candidates been so quiet on the issue of who they will endorse? On this episode, we are joined by founding dean and distinguished professor of law at the University of California, Irvine, School of Law Erwin Chemerinsky. This episode is the first of a two-part Amicus series on how the 2016 elections could reshape the Supreme Court. To learn more about Amicus, click here. This is a lightly edited transcript and may differ slightly from the edited podcast. This podcast was recorded before Justice Antonin Scalia died on Feb. 13, 2016. Dahlia Lithwick: Hi, and welcome to Amicus, Slate's Supreme Court podcast. I'm Dahlia Lithwick. I cover the courts for Slate. This week as the court is on its long winter break, we thought we'd turn to another kind of current events, and as some of you have pointed out in your letters, there is, in fact, a presidential election upon us. The Iowa caucuses are just behind us and, as you probably know, one of the lasting legacies of most presidencies will be the impact that that presidency has on the Supreme Court. And, so, this week we thought we'd turn to the topic of the Supreme Court and the 2016 election. It's the first installment in a two-part series we're going to be doing this campaign season about how the election might shape the Court in the future. This week, to look at that question from the political left, we have as our guest one of my favorite court watchers, Erwin Chemerinsky, current and founding dean of UC Irvine's School of Law. Irwin is one of the most cited and most prolific law professors in the country. He's published over 200 law review articles, and he's argued several important cases at the high court, and is one of the few people I know who speaks in flawless outline form. So, Erwin, welcome to Amicus. It is a delight to have you here. Erwin Chemerinsky: Oh, it's my great pleasure, and thank you so much for the sweet introduction. Lithwick: So, Erwin, let's first of all just put some facts on the table and then you react. We have three justices--Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy--who will be 80 or over by Election Day. Stephen Breyer will be 78. And the average retirement age for a justice is, I'm told, about 77. So, this is a really significantly aged court; right? This is a big, big election. Chemerinsky: Your statistics are right. Let me just modify them a bit. Since 1960, the average retirement age for Supreme Court justices has been 79 years old. In 2017, the year of the inauguration of the next president, four of those justices then will be 79 or older because that's the year Justice Breyer turns 79 and, of course, by then both Justices Scalia and Kennedy will have crossed their 80th birthday, and Justice Ginsburg is about to turn 83 this spring. Lithwick: So, this discussion--you know, I find when I read on the left or on the right, ""oh, my God, it's the most consequential election for the Supreme Court,"" it's kind of confounded, Erwin, by the fact that it depends, of course, on who retires. In other words, if Ruth Bader Ginsburg were to step down but Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton is president, does it make that much of a difference, or really are we only talking about if a conservative steps down and a Democrat wins or vice versa or the, you know, nuclear option, which is Justice Kennedy stepping down and everyone going bananas? Chemerinsky: Imagine that it's a two-term president. In recent memory, most presidents have been two-term presidents. Then it seems almost a certainty that there will be four vacancies between now and Jan. 20, 2025. And then whether it's a Republican or Democrat, they're going to get to shape the court for years to come. If it's a Republican president replacing Ginsburg and Breyer along with Scalia and Kennedy, we can imagine what that will mean, but a Democratic president who gets to replace Scalia and Kennedy along with Ginsburg and Breyer, you think about what that means. I think the election that's most analogous would be 1968 where soon after being elected, Richard Nixon got to fill four vacancies on the Supreme Court. Imagine if Hubert Humphrey had won that election how different things would be. Or even the 2000 and 2004 elections. Imagine that Al Gore or John Kerry had replaced William Rehnquist and Sandra Day O'Connor rather than it being George W. Bush with John Roberts and Samuel Alito. We can identify so many cases that affect us all that would have come out differently. Lithwick: Well, I actually would like you to speak to that directly because I think for a lot of our listeners, there's, you know, some vague inchoate sense that it made a big difference to swap out Sandra Day O'Connor, put in Sam Alito, but can you tell us doctrinally just for listeners who maybe aren't following the tick tock of what's happened since Sam Alito came onto the court ten years ago, of how doctrine really changes when just one member of the court changes? Chemerinsky: Of course. Pick a few examples. Start with Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. In 2003 in a case called McConnell v. Federal Election Commission, the Supreme Court upheld the provisions, the McCain-Feingold, the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act. Just seven years later in Citizens United, the Supreme Court expressly overrules that decision, the court declares unconstitutional the versions of McCain-Feingold that limit corporations and unions can spend in independent expenditures. Why did the court change seven years later? Did they find some musty history of the First Amendment that led them to believe they made a mistake? Of course not. The only difference in the court was Samuel Alito replacing Sandra Day O'Connor. Or we can pick another example in the area of abortion. In 2000 in a case called Stenberg v. Carhart, the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a Nebraska law prohibiting the procedure that's called by anti-abortion groups partial-birth abortion. Seven years later, 5 to 4, the Supreme Court upholds the Federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. It's not that the laws were different; again, it was entirely a matter of Samuel Alito replacing Sandra Day O'Connor. Or to pick an example that's before the court this term: affirmative action. In 2003 in Grutter v. Bollinger, the court, 5 to 4, says that colleges, universities have a compelling interest to have a diverse student body; college, universities can use race as one factor in admissions if it's to benefit minorities. Justice O'Connor writes the opinion for the court, but Samuel Alito strongly opposes all forms of affirmative action and is certainly a fifth vote to limit Grutter v. Bollinger and maybe to overrule it. And I could go on and on with examples. But when you think of things like this--campaign finance, abortion, affirmative action--you see how much one justice can affect all of us, often the most important, the most intimate aspects of our lives. Lithwick: So, this leads me to the question that I've been puzzling with, and I'm not sure what the answer is, and maybe there's no answer, Erwin, but all of the cases, with the exception of campaign finance, all of the issues you've mentioned somehow are before the court in the 2015 term, plus not just affirmative action and abortion and the contraception mandate in Obamacare--oh, and by the way, Obama's immigration reforms--how is it possible that the court, in an election year, takes on every single hot-button issue that is guaranteed to make people, even people who are on screensave about the court for the entirety of their lives have to be thinking about court this summer when they're thinking about the elections, why is the court wandering into this minefield right before a presidential election? Chemerinsky: In terms of why this year? It seems that every term there's blockbuster cases right now. Last year we had the marriage equality case, the year before there was the Hobby Lobby case about the contraceptive mandate, the year before that it was Shelby County where the court struck down key provisions of the Voting Rights Act, the year before that it was the case about the Affordable Care Act. So, I don't think this term is extraordinary in having blockbuster cases, and it's not surprising that the court was going to take up these issues--affirmative action, abortion, immigration--when they came before the justices. These are issues that have split the lower courts, they're issues of great national importance, and this is a court that really wants to have the last word on issues of great national importance. I think it's a good thing that the court has these high-profile cases this term if it means that people will be thinking about the court this summer and fall because I truly believe there is no more important issue for the November 2016 presidential election than who's going to fill those likely four vacancies on the Supreme Court. Lithwick: Right. This leads me to my next question, which is: Americans don't really focus on the courts as a voting issue. And maybe the best evidence right now, Erwin, is that we keep having presidential debates in which we don't talk about the court, and to the extent that we talk about the court, it's in, you know, very, very coded language that we'll get to in a minute. But why is it that the court--I mean, I think you and I would stipulate right here right now the composition of the Supreme Court, whether you're a conservative or a liberal, has got to be the most important thing on your mind, and yet, it's not. And as you said, the last time it really was, was maybe the 1968 election when Richard Nixon ran against the Warren Court. That's really the last time we've had an election in which people put the court at the very forefront of their thoughts when they were voting, right? Chemerinsky: Certainly. Richard Nixon ran against the Warren Court and made it an issue, and yet, you think of other presidential elections that were so pivotal with regard to the court--like 2000 and 2004--and it was barely discussed. And it tends to get discussed more by Republicans than it does by Democrats. I think you ask a great question: Why isn't the composition of the court a more salient issue? And I don't think there's a simple answer to it. Part of it is that I think that people still have this belief that law exists apart from the justices and, so, they don't fully appreciate how much the identity of the justices makes all the difference. The cases that come to the Supreme Court are ones that could come out either way--often involve balancing of competing interests. How that's done is so much a function of the justices who are there, their life experience, and their values, but I don't think that people realize that. I also worry that people don't realize how much what the court does really does affect them. I think of the right to abortion, I think of affirmative action, I think with regard to campaign finance in the long term, how much it affects all of us, but people often aren't focused on that or maybe they don't realize that. Lithwick: And yet, you pointed this out, and it's worth reinforcing this--certainly I think the Republican Party, the Republican nominees are more vocal about this. You know, famously, Supreme Court litigator Michael Carvin said at a Federalidt Society event last year that, quote, if the election goes wrong, we will all descend into a hellish existence from which we will never emerge, end quote. This is what the Washington Times reported at the time. So, it does seem as though the American right is at least more organized and more thoughtful on this issue than the American left; is that fair? Chemerinsky: I think so. I think that the Republican base has just cared much more about the composition of the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts than the Democratic base, and I think that's translated into something that really does affect all of us in almost on a daily basis, and that's that the Republicans have tended to appoint much more conservative individuals to the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts than Democratic presidents appointed liberals to the Supreme Court and to the lower federal courts; that if I was to do an ideological lineup of, say, federal appeals court judges, overall the Republican appointees are much more conservative than the Democratic appointees are liberal, and I think that's because the Republican base cares more about it than the Democratic base cares about it. Lithwick: So, this, of course, leads me to the nuts and bolts of John Roberts. Why? Why has John Roberts become the whipping boy for the GOP nominees? We can play for you Ted Cruz, we can play for you Donald Trump. Donald Trump has tweeted that John Roberts is a liberal, and Ted Cruz has made it his personal business to go after John Roberts as being a wussy, you know, weak-kneed, nonthoughtful conservative. Why is John Roberts getting all the heat here? Chemerinsky: It's absurd to the extent that they say that they have to assume no one's paying any attention to the Supreme Court. This is John Roberts' 11th term. John Roberts votes in the conservative direction 95, 98 percent of the time. Think again of the issues that conservatives care most about--abortion. He's with the conservatives in upholding the Federal Partial-Birth Abortion Act. Affirmative action--no one has written a stronger opinion in recent years against affirmative action than John Roberts and Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1. In 2007 we said the Constitution requires color blindness, and the government has to stop all discrimination based on race, and he sees affirmative action as discrimination based on race. Guns: District of Columbia v. Heller, the most gun rights-protective decision in American history is with John Roberts in the majority. Campaign finance, Citizens United and the cases like that. There's only one area where John Roberts has disappointed the conservatives, and that is he upheld the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act, and this past term uphold tax credits for those who purchased insurance on federally created exchanges. But based on that one example out of so many, the conservatives have turned against John Roberts. It's absurd what they're saying. Why are they saying it? My guess is because Republicans like to run against the Supreme Court, that they like to accuse the Supreme Court of judicial activism and, so, they've turned on John Roberts in this way based on the Affordable Care Act. But instead, I think anybody who watches the court knows that John Roberts has been overwhelmingly conservative. And just to mention one more example, marriage equality. John Roberts writes a powerful dissent last spring and a couple years earlier in the marriage-equality cases, yet the conservatives want to forget that. Lithwick: So, I want to talk just for one more minute about the Affordable Care Act cases because that's clearly the coding--I agree with you. Let's listen: This is Donald Trump just last week on ABC News, and let's play the quote and talk about it. Donald Trump: Justice Roberts turned out to be an absolute disaster. He turned out to be an absolute disaster because he gave us Obamacare. Lithwick: Erwin, I guess I want to ask: What does the ACA signal? Why is Obamacare singled out as the issue on which because Roberts defected on this, he's basically Brennan? Chemerinsky: Well, there's no doubt that the Affordable Care Act has been the most politically divisive federal law adopted probably since the 1964 Civil Rights Act. It's perhaps the most important social program created by the federal government since the war on poverty and maybe even since social security in the New Deal. Every Republican in Congress voted against it, almost every Republican lower federal court judge voted to strike it down and, so, it is used, I think, by Republicans as a litmus test, and they use it to evaluate John Roberts. But again, it's taking it so much out of the context of the rest of John Roberts' record as chief justice. Even John Roberts' career as a lower court judge, a lawyer, and going all the way back to when he was a law clerk for William Rehnquist. Lithwick: So, let me posit this and you react and tell me why I'm wrong, but one of the things that Ted Cruz has been doing in his attacks on John Roberts is suggesting that the problem is that Republicans defect--they don't stay true to the cause. Here's Ted Cruz saying the Republicans have an abysmal record. We bat about .500. Half the nominees Republicans have put on the court have not just occasionally disappointed but have turned into disasters. So, is there something about control going on here where there's a feeling that if you're not in lockstep with the GOP and Republican values, then you're a disaster and you've defected? Whereas there's somehow an expectation on the American left and certainly among the leadership on the American left that justices are going to justice. They're just going to kind of free range out there and sometimes Justice Breyer disappoints and Elena Kagan disappoints, but we don't have that litmus test where we say, if you just one time get out of line, we get to code you as a disaster. What going on there do you think? Chemerinsky: I think that's right, but I think we have to also remember that this is political rhetoric, and Ted Cruz or Donald Trump are saying what they think will appeal to the conservative base who votes in Republicans caucuses and Republican primaries. Running against the court is something that is useful. Now, I think empirically, Ted Cruz is wrong, but I think that most Republican nominees--like most Democratic nominees--have voted as one would predict. And, so, on the current court, certainly Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito are everything that the Republicans could have hoped for. Now on the other hand, Justice Souter wasn't what the Republicans hoped for, Justice Kennedy has been more of a disappointment to Republicans, obviously, than, say, Scalia, Thomas, Alito, or even Roberts, but we could do the same thing with regard to the Democratic appointees. Byron White was President Kennedy's appointee, but he was one of the more conservative Justices on the court in his era. Got to remember, he was one of the two dissenters in Roe v. Wade, one of the dissenters in Miranda v. Arizona. So, most justices are what the political party that appoints them want, but there will always be justices who are not quite ideologically as pure as the base wants. That's, I think, why you hear Ted Cruz, Donald Trump saying the things that they're saying. Lithwick: So, now I want to ask you the analogous question on the left, which is, in effect, why Citizens United? It seems that Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders have been certainly less voluble about their loathing of the court, but boy, get them wound up about Citizens United, and they can talk all day. And Bernie Sanders recently made some news by tweeting, ""Any Supreme Court nominee of mine will make overturning Citizens United one of their first decisions,"" which he got shellacked for because you don't get to just overturn things the day you're appointed. But help us understand, if you would, what Citizens United signifies on the left that's akin to the outrage directed at the Affordable Care Act on the right. Chemerinsky: Citizens United is the case that means that corporations can spend as much money as they want under the corporate treasury to get people elected or defeated. The fact that corporations can do this is something that outrages the left, but there's also something else going on here. I think Citizens United is a case that's unpopular more across the political spectrum than many Supreme Court cases are. I've written a lot of op-eds. I don't think I've ever written an op-ed that got as much response that was favorable as when I wrote the day after Citizens United criticizing the case. Usually, as you know, op-eds draw negative emails at a ratio about 10 or 100 to 1. Almost every email I got after I wrote about Citizens United was tremendously critical of the decision, including from many who identified themselves as conservatives. So, I think what Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton are doing is picking an example that certainly appeals to their base but may also have a much broader appeal to voters in saying the Supreme Court just got it wrong here. Lithwick: I'm going to take you away from the election for one brief second because I feel that we need to mark on this show that when the court returns from the winter break at the end of February, it is going to stumble upon, as Adam Liptak points out this week in the New York Times, an anniversary which is that it will have been 10 years since Clarence Thomas asked a question at oral argument, and I wonder if you want to reflect on what it means that one of our nine justices literally hasn't spoken at an oral argument in 10 years. Chemerinsky: I would say this whether it was a conservative or a liberal justice. I think it shows tremendous disrespect for the process to never ask a question during oral argument. I understand that some justices are going to be more vocal and some are going to be more quiet. I find the same thing in teaching law school classes--some students are more vocal, some more quiet. But the idea that a justice on the Supreme Court would go 10 years without ever participating in oral argument is something that we should be outraged about. Oral argument is the opportunity for the lawyers to get the answer to questions that are of concern to the justices. As you've mentioned, I've argued several times in the Supreme Court, I've argued dozens of times in lower courts of appeals, I want the judges, the justices to ask me the questions that have greater concern. Can it really be that in 10 years--and that's probably over 800 oral arguments--not once there's been a question that Clarence Thomas has needed an answer to? That's inconceivable. And, so, that's why I say whether it be a liberal or a conservative, I think it shows disrespect for the process to never, ever ask a question. Lithwick: Erwin, my last question, I want to give you a moment to talk about your book a little bit. The Case Against the Supreme Court came out last year. It was really a tremendous, one of the most important books I read last year, and it's, in effect, a kind of paradoxical book insofar as deeply, deeply critical about the Supreme Court; not just the current Roberts Court, which you've criticized in other places, but deeply critical about the Supreme Court as an institution over centuries, more or less saying, you know, for the most part the court has always--unerringly almost--sided with the wealthy and the privileged and the powerful, and that even if at its high-water marks of what it was doing to support the poor and the underprivileged and the people who are disenfranchised, you know, at the apex of the Warren Court, for instance, it still did so much less than it should have. So, help us to understand as listeners who maybe aren't familiar with your work how it's possible that you, who have devoted your lifetime and more than 200 law review articles to engaging with this institution, can feel so disappointed in it and how it is that you can argue at the same time that the court matters so much in this upcoming election, even though it is so deeply flawed? Chemerinsky: You're so kind to ask about it. I realized as I've been teaching and writing about the Supreme Court, I've often been making excuses for it. And then when I look at the court over the course of American history, it's so often failed, often at the most important tasks, often the most important times. When we look at the Supreme Court and race over the course of American history, when we look at the Supreme Court in times of crisis over the course of American history, when we look at the Supreme Court in so many areas where the Supreme Court didn't do what it was supposed to do. And, so, I deeply care about the Supreme Court, but I think it can do better in the future, and I think the only way that we can hope for that is to point to its failures and offer suggestions for its improvement. I think it was Winston Churchill who said that democracy is a terrible form of government, but it's so much better than whatever else there is. I think judicial reviews often fail, but I can't imagine not having judicial review. When I think of the kind of people who I represented--people on death row, a Guantanamo detainee, a homeless man, and I can go on--for them it's really the courts or nothing, I would just like to see the Courts do a much better job of upholding the Constitution.

Previous shameful moments: Rand Paul, putatively showing us everyday Americans who endorse him, used photos of Germans. And Donald Trump, in an ad about America's porous borders, instead used footage of people crossing into a Spanish enclave in Morocco. (""No shit, it's not the Mexican border,"" his campaign manager frothed to NBC News, ""but that's what our country is going to look like."") These things happen. Who among us hasn't used a composite image of Turkish air force jets soaring above the Russian navy Black Sea Fleet in an attempt to honor American veterans? ""It's the No. 1 peril in using stock,"" one Democratic political advertising vet told me. ""Whenever there's an election in Kentucky, somebody uses a photo of a miner and that miner is actually in Europe. And it ends up in a news story every time."" It's such a problem that the stock services have begun providing suites of images guaranteed to be shot in the USA, or even in specific states. These mistakes happen in part because of the sheer amount of stock required to do political messaging these days. With emailed newsletters, Web videos, and Twitter/Facebook/Snapchat/Instagram feeds joining old standbys like postal mailers, TV ads, and lawn signs, there's an unquenchable thirst for new images and footage that people haven't seen before. ""I tell the new hires at our agency that a lot of their job will be hunting around on Getty, Corbis, and Shutterstock,"" says the ad guy, referencing a few of the leading stock services. ""It's hard to find fresh stuff. Every ad about Medicare uses the same three images of seniors looking at their bills and shaking their heads. You might have to wade through a hundred pages of stock photos to find the one that feels new, powerful, authentic, and not cheesy."" The danger of using stock that feels stale? You end up with something like this parody of generic stock gone wrong. Or you paint a picture that doesn't look like real life. ""We're often representing unions or middle class people,"" says Lisa Suchy, of the Democratic political marketing firm Mack Sumner Communications. ""And a lot of the images on the stock sites are of beautiful models, not of real people with dirt under their fingernails."" Suchy says she's a fan of Shestock, a service that features photos of everyday women taken by female photographers. ""I think it's a unique mission,"" says Suchy. ""It's pictures of real women doing everyday things, not of the dressed-up supermodel or the flawless, skinny businesswoman."" In recent years, as the costs of photo equipment, production, and distribution have gone down, there's been an explosion in options and a drop in price for people who buy stock imagery. ""It's possible to make an entire, high-quality ad now from stock,"" says the Democratic ad guy, ""in a way that it wasn't 10 years ago. You can make things with a scope and scale you could never afford if you were paying for your own shoots."" Consider this Chris Christie ad from January, titled ""Strong and Clear"": This ad was made by Damien Harvey of Agentia Creative. Harvey's a longtime Republican ad producer who's worked for outfits like Mitt Romney's super PAC and for the Koch-sponsored Freedom Partners. Last week, just before the Christie campaign came to a close, Harvey walked me through the choices he made as he pieced this ad together, alternating stock images with footage of Christie that came from the campaign itself. :07 - A photo of Hillary Clinton, bought from the Associated Press ""AP Images is a big go-to place for high quality news-style photography,"" says Harvey. ""I got Hillary standing with a teleprompter because of the association with Obama using teleprompters."" :09 - Dissolve to a photo of hands holding an Obama ""Hope"" poster, bought from Shutterstock ""For republicans, that poster might as well be Stalin. It's such a negative image burned in the brains of conservatives and it makes our voting public cringe. I'm trying to say that Hillary is just a different version of Barack Obama--that's what we get across doing that dissolve."" :10 - A burning building with gunmen inside, followed by a burning car, both images bought from the stock site Pond5 ""Benghazi is very real for Republican voters, and especially for conservatives. My idea was in talking about Hillary's foreign policy, let's create a visual narrative with an attack on a building and a cliched, burned out, exploded car."" :12 - Men with their faces covered, holding machine guns, standing in front of what appears to be an ISIS flag ""I love this shot. It's really hard to find ISIS imagery that you can buy. So I took a still frame from one of ISIS' own videos that you can find posted on YouTube."" :15 - Footage of what appears to be Middle Eastern people burning American flags, bought from Pond5 ""Everyone's seen flag burning a million times, but I like how it cuts to the next shot."" :18 - Footage of a rocket taking off ""The rocket is from a YouTube of an Iranian test video they released. I purposely picked it because there's something to me about nuclear doom when you see a rocket taking off in the middle of a desert. It's a real potential nightmare and it's about us giving the Iranians that ability."" :23 - A montage of faces, all photos bought from Shutterstock. ""Here I'm trying to mix some real commercial-style, Madison Avenue emotion into the spot. So instead of showing a sidewalk with a thousand people on it, why not go into the stock library and do a face montage, picking out solid, quality faces that look like real Americans. And a baby. Because babies always work. Airplanes, trains, and babies."" Harvey wouldn't reveal the prices he paid for these images. Expenses can add up. According to the Democratic ad-maker I spoke to, the highest of high-end national ads--with lots of quick cuts and only top quality footage--might incur up to $50,000 just in stock costs. But on the bottom end of the scale, 100 bucks can secure you a decent photo or a brief time-lapse image. The economics of stock are such that some ad agencies hired by campaigns just buy photos of their candidate from Getty instead of hiring a professional photographer to document campaign events. Super PACs and other entities that aren't allowed to coordinate with campaigns are even more likely to turn to stock services. Again, the danger here is that the stock image you slap on your mailer is in fact a photo of a convicted Belarussian pederast who just happens to be a doppelganger for your candidate. Given the prevalence of negative ads, many stock photo searches by political campaigns are actually for photos of their opponents. And here the criteria are very different. ""I think photographers used to weed out the bad photos they took of candidates,"" says Suchy. ""But now they seem to have learned that if they leave a few of those in, they'll still get bought by somebody. In 2012, we found one of Romney with his mouth hanging open that we used all the time."" Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 presidential election."	Morning in ... Canada?

If you watched Saturday's Republican debate, you saw the opposite. You saw a brawl. And the instigator--the man who turned a debate about leading the country into a cage match--was Donald Trump. Trump had a single strategy for the night: Attack, attack, and attack. Early in the debate, he blasted Jeb Bush for his national security plans, specifically criticizing how Bush would go about fighting both ISIS and the Syrian regime. ""You can't fight two wars at one time. You listen to him, and you listen to some of the folks that I've been listening to--that's why we've been in the Middle East for 15 years, and we haven't won anything,"" he said, the first of many jabs at the former Florida governor. But Trump went beyond this. He used these attacks on Jeb to litigate the presidency of his brother. ""The war in Iraq, we spent $2 trillion, thousands of lives, we don't even have it,"" Trump said. He continued: ""George Bush made a mistake. We can make mistakes. But that one was a beauty. We should have never been in Iraq. We have destabilized the Middle East."" To millions of American voters--independents, Democrats, and even Republicans--this is true. The majority of Americans think the Iraq war was a bad decision and, until recently, gave low ratings to George W. Bush. Trump was speaking to them. Unfortunately for the real estate magnate, this isn't the general election. He still needs to win the Republican nomination, and Republicans still favor the Iraq war and President Bush. Which is why Republicans onstage went to bat for the former president, defending his tenure against Trump's charge that President Bush failed to keep the country safe. ""The World Trade Center came down during your brother's reign, remember that,"" responded Trump to one of Jeb's defenses of the previous president's security record. When Marco Rubio had a chance to speak, he pushed back. ""I just want to say, at least on behalf of me and my family, I thank God all the time it was George W. Bush in the White House on 9/11 and not Al Gore,"" he said. This was the pattern for the night. Trump would attack, with reckless swings at everyone on stage (but especially Jeb Bush), and his targets would attempt to push back, all arguing on his terms. Bolstering this free for all was the audience, which clapped, and booed, and encouraged the pitched battle between the remaining candidates. ""You are single biggest liar,"" said Trump in a heated exchange with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. ""This guy will say anything, nasty guy. Now I know why he doesn't have one endorsement from any of his colleagues."" In turn, Cruz replied by trying to hit Trump on his past positions and rhetoric. And while the crowd backed Cruz, the fact of the matter is that Trump's voters love his aggression. His attacks are part of the appeal. Cruz, Bush, and others have to engage Trump--lest they look weak--but doing so lets Trump stay in his element. If you were watching the Republican debate to get a read on policy and plans, you were disappointed. The entire occasion--all two hours--were consumed by this death match of a presidential debate. With that said, this night of combat wasn't a waste. No, it didn't illuminate anything about the candidates, but it did tell us something about the Republican Party. Even now, as it fights to win a term in the White House, the GOP is unwilling to deal with the legacy of the Bush administration. For everyone but Trump, there is nothing to apologize for and nothing to change. Bush, in their view, took the right steps. This is where Trump has an advantage. His Bush-bashing may fall short with conservative Republicans, but more moderate Republicans--and even conservative independents--might back Trump's take on the Iraq war and the legacy of George W. Bush. Indeed, if he wins the nomination, Trump's vocal disagreement with Republican orthodoxy on Iraq will stand as an asset, not a liability. For all of his anger and vulgarity, Trump understands what the GOP (as an institution) doesn't. Americans may want a Republican in November, but they don't want a return to the Bush years. The party doesn't want Trump's ""common sense conservatism"" on these issues, but it might be what it needs. See more of Slate's coverage of the GOP presidential primary."	Donald Trump Turned the GOP Debate Into a Cage Match, Which Is Good for Donald Trump
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/jeb_bush_had_his_best_debate_in_south_carolina.html	Jeb Bush's impressive performance in Saturday night's enjoyably manic Republican debate may very well help him land a third place showing, behind Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz, in South Carolina's upcoming primary. Amidst sleepy performances from Gov. John Kasich, Ben Carson, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Cruz, Bush was considerably more aggressive during the CBS debate. He challenged Trump, defended his record, and made a strong national security pitch to voters in a state well-known for it's pro-military views. Despite a handful of pointed exchanges, the other candidates largely ignored Trump. The problem that has bedeviled the party for months--essentially, that the candidates won't unite to take down Trump--remains, and one impressive debate from Bush won't solve it. There was one moment during the debate that signaled that someone other than Bush may be aware of the problem. It occurred during the heated discussion of George W. Bush's response to terrorism. After Bush put forth a spirited defense of his brother's administration, Trump essentially blamed the former president for the Sept. 11 attacks. Jeb fired back, Trump lodged some insults, and the back-and-forth appeared to be reminiscent of previous debates, with Bush seeming more resolute. And then, somewhat surprisingly, Rubio rose to the defense of George W. Bush, essentially helping make Jeb's case. After months of bashing each other and letting Trump coast, Rubio and Bush focused their negative attention onto the man who is leading in the polls and favored to win the nomination. Rubio drew loud applause from the audience, and Trump seemed momentarily out of his element. But this was the only time that the candidates in any concerted way attacked Trump. The businessman may have hurt himself by a performance that was, by any rational calculation, unhinged. But his own gaffes haven't hurt him yet, and he probably needs to face tough questioning from his opponents. Despite the Bush exchange and a brief skirmish with Cruz, this never really happened. (After Cruz attacked him for being insufficient and inconsistent in his conservatism, Rubio had the chance to follow up; he ignored Trump and talked about his anemic anti-poverty program.) The fact that the candidates didn't take their opportunity to attack Trump was particularly surprising, coming as it did the week after Trump's overwhelming victory in New Hampshire and countless stories about his strong lead nationally and in upcoming states. Moreover, the unexpected death of Justice Antonin Scalia provided an opportunity for the candidates to highlight Trump's previous support for abortion rights and Roe v. Wade. The reduced field of candidates--there were only six onstage tonight--provided a further opportunity for a sustained attack on Trump. But it never came. As for those other candidates, Cruz had a few good moments (and may benefit from the fact that Trump and Bush went after each other). Rubio had no major gaffes but probably didn't do himself any favors. And Kasich's constant pleas for bipartisanship are more than grating; they seem aimed at a more sedate Republican Party that no longer exists. That left Jeb. He cleverly associated Trump with Obama by saying they both blamed George W. Bush too often. And Jeb probably did a bit to dispel the image of himself as weak. (Unfortunately, like his brother, he is incapable of pronouncing the word nuclear.) But what he didn't do was fundamentally change the race. Every day that passes with Trump holding a massive lead in the polls is a victory for him. Bush was good tonight, and if he had performed this well months ago it's possible that this race would be different today. As it is, his victory tonight may just be a minor speed bump on Donald Trump's road to the nomination.	Jeb Bush Learned to Fight in South Carolina
28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/antonin_scalia_s_death_will_change_the_2016_election.html	"In less insane times, the death of an elderly Supreme Court justice would lead to the president nominating a qualified justice and the Senate likely confirming that figure in a few months or less. But the idea of that happening following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia sounds absolutely preposterous, and it's going to have profound effects on both presidential and congressional elections this fall. Let's first stipulate that the chances of this Republican Senate confirming a Supreme Court appointment of President Obama's in an election year are ... well, Sen. Mike Lee's own spokesman puts them at ""less than zero."" I would put it at, say, 0 to 5 percent. Some would argue that stonewalling a president's Supreme Court nominee for 11 months as a pure political play would set a horrific precedent. I would agree. And? The most generous scenario would be that Obama appoints a judge whose confirmation easily sailed through the Senate on a bipartisan basis when appointed to a lower court. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, trying to look fair, calls that person up for a vote (assuming the appointee even gets out of the Senate Judiciary Committee). Other Republican senators filibuster. (Remember that then-Majority Leader Harry Reid's 2014 ""nuclear option"" eliminating the filibuster on judicial appointments did not apply to Supreme Court appointments.) The Democratic caucus has 46 votes. Some Republicans in blue or purple states up for re-election vote with Democrats if they like, but it won't be enough to get to 60. Republicans then argue that it's too late in the calendar under the Thurmond rule--which is more like a guideline--to nominate a new candidate. Democrats beat Republicans over the head as being obstructionist, and the next president selects the court's ninth justice. ... Or McConnell never even bothers to go through the motions. So how does this affect the campaign itself? Scalia's death should result in an extraordinary amount of money being spent in Senate races to determine the chamber's control. But it's not like these races were going to be conducted on the cheap previously. Also, it's not clear that control of the chamber is the central problem here. Senate leaders might be able to get away with blocking a SCOTUS pick for 11 months; four years is a whole different order. Senate control will affect the gradient of ideology that the next president is allowed to get away with. That's not nothing. But it's not the whole ballgame. Does this stonewalling help Democrats in November? Republicans blocking a Supreme Court nomination would allow Democrats to portray Republicans as unreasonably obstructionist, though Republicans tend to take that as a badge of honor. It could boost Democratic turnout, since they have the opportunity to retake the Supreme Court for the first time in decades, if only they vote. The counter to this is that Republicans will instruct their voters to stop Democrats from forming the first liberal Supreme Court majority in decades. If early primary voting numbers are any indication, Republicans already have the advantage in prospective enthusiasm and will use the fear of a liberal Armageddon to maintain that. As we're all aware, though, there's a long way to go until the general election. This turn of events would seem to rocket ""electability"" to the top of primary voters' concerns in selecting their candidates. Hillary Clinton has been dangling the Supreme Court nominations card front and center already. We can now reasonably assume that it will comprise 99 percent of what she says for as long as she faces primary competition. I would like to say that the court vacancy would make GOP primary voters second-guess their support for either Donald Trump or Sen. Ted Cruz, but nothing makes GOP primary voters second-guess their support for Trump or Cruz. If the ideological tilting of the Supreme Court is to be determined by the next president, as it seems it will, then this will be an election of monumental importance. Expect its ugliness to match.

29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/02/hillary_clinton_shouldn_t_apologize_for_being_a_moderate.html	"Most liberals think the Republican presidential race is nuts. Those right-wing candidates are sucking up so hard to the Tea Party and the Bible thumpers that they've lost touch with reality. But a similar problem is happening on the Democratic side. Sen. Bernie Sanders is pulling the party to the left, Hillary Clinton is chasing him, and the issues and positions under discussion are drifting away from the political center. It's painful to watch Clinton as she tries to outflank Sanders. She's repackaging herself as the fiercer feminist, the firmer advocate of gun control, the more assiduous courtier of protest movements. Last week, in their first one-on-one debate, Sanders accused Clinton of being a ""moderate."" Clinton, pathetically, rejected his characterization as ""unfair."" Let's cut out the purging, groveling, and acting. Hillary Clinton is a moderate. Moderation is an honorable way to live and govern. In fact, it's the best way, because the world is too complex to fit any ideology perfectly. Clinton may shun the M-word, but if you listened to her carefully in Thursday night's debate in Milwaukee, you heard how a moderate thinks and why it makes sense. Here are some examples. 1. Fiscal reality. Early in the debate, Judy Woodruff of PBS pointed out that federal spending is 21 percent of the U.S. economy. She asked Sanders how big the government would become if he were president. ""Of course there will be a limit,"" Sanders replied, but he didn't specify what it would be. He said the government should provide free public college for everyone. He said his ""Medicare for all"" plan would ""save the average middle class family $5,000 a year"" while costing that family just $500. Clinton questioned this agenda. She said it would ""increase the size of the federal government by about 40 percent."" She asked how Sanders could promise $5,000 worth of benefits for $500 in taxes. ""I will not throw us further into debt,"" Clinton warned, adding: ""We should not make promises we can't keep, because that will further ... alienate Americans from understanding and believing we can together make some real changes in people's lives."" 2. Political reality. Sanders vowed to replace the private health insurance market with his single-payer plan. If France and the United Kingdom can do it, so can we, he argued: All we need is ""the courage to take on the drug companies ... the insurance companies, and the medical equipment suppliers."" Clinton replied that this was a nice idea but would be too hard to enact:"	Hillary Clinton Shouldn't Apologize for Being a Moderate
