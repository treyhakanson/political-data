The state offers almost no barriers to entry. Filing fees are nonexistent and a grand total of 25 signatures are needed to become a candidate. The man who emerged from this no-horse race to win Thursday's Democratic primary has no chance to win in November. But it's still worth hearing what Charlie Brown has to say. This fall's election in the heavily red state didn't figure to be close, even before most of the Democratic party's top candidates declined to run. Republican Bill Haslam cruised to victory in 2010 and has a multi-million-dollar war chest. No incumbent governor in the state has failed to win re-election since 1979, and even that figure is misleading--the governor that year, Ray Blanton, was hampered by the fact that he was on his way to jail. And this wasn't the first time Tennessee Democrats nominated a virtual unknown: Two years ago, the state's party was embarrassed by the accidental U.S. Senate nomination of Mark Clayton, a Nashville floor installer and the vice president of an anti-gay hate group. These are the unique conditions which led me, on Thursday night, to wake up half of the tiny town of Oakdale, Tennessee, population 212, in search of the party's newest nominee, a political novice the likes of which we haven't seen since Alvin Greene stumbled his way into the spotlight in South Carolina four years ago. It was nearly midnight when I finally reached him. His name is Charles V. ""Charlie"" Brown, and he perked up immediately when he heard I was calling from Denver. ""I need to get out to Colorado,"" the 72-year-old said. ""Hunting season is coming up, right?"" Reaching Brown hadn't been easy. Of the four candidates for the Democratic nomination, the Tennessean reported that Brown was one of three with no working website. That wasn't entirely true. One of Brown's competitors, Ron Noonan, had something like one: a YouTube video of himself singing a Vince Gill ballad in an open field. Brown even had his own sort-of online presence: a Facebook page that as of Thursday night featured no posts and no pictures, save for one with him kneeling in front of three giant dead catfish (on Friday afternoon that photo was replaced by one of him and his wife Julia Sue). On the page, his name was accidentally misspelled as ""Chrles."" In the process of trying to find Brown, I'd called many of his neighbors. All accepted my apologies for intruding so late. Some knew that Brown was running for the state's highest office. Yet none said they had voted for him, though they swore he shouldn't take it personally--not one of the nearly dozen Oakdale residents I talked to said they had voted for anyone at all. When I was finally able to reach a neighbor who had his new number, not the old one which was listed but disconnected, I asked what I thought was a basic question. Did Brown have any signs up in his yard? The neighbor didn't know, but the man himself answered definitively a few minutes later. ""I did not put up a sign,"" Brown said. ""I don't believe in them."" Then he told me what he does believe in. According to Brown, his candidacy began on the side of a local highway. ""I was waiting on this guy at the interstate,"" he said, when he felt something come over him. ""I just fell on my knees right outside the truck and went to praying."" Brown says that he felt a sudden revelation come from the Lord, who asked him to run for higher office. This was not a normal request. Brown told me that the only other time he had run for an elected position was nearly 50 years earlier when he lost in an attempt to become something known as a road supervisor. For most of his life he had traveled through the South working in construction--building Marriotts in Atlanta, helping put a marble slab on the face of one of Nashville's downtown skyscrapers--before finally returning to Oakdale, the town where he had been born. As we talked, he kept me updated on the returns. ""I'm getting up to around 90,000 votes right now,"" he said. The click of his mouse was audible as he refreshed the page. ""I'm a computer nut. I love this computer."" Brown didn't campaign in a typical way. He didn't go to banquets or barbecues. He didn't send mailers, or pay for TV ads. He said he didn't raise any money at all, though he did solicit donations. And he hadn't even talked to the people who lived nearest to him. Instead, he told me that he sent a letter to the editor of nearly every paper in the state, a short missive full of misspellings that ended with the plea: ""Please join The NRA."" Few publications actually ran the letter, which began with him saying that he ""would like to strap [Gov. Haslam's] butt to the [electric] chair and give him about half the jolt."" He also said that if he won ""we will have hog hunting again."" Brown's main source of votes, he told me, was a club he belonged to. The Original Mountain Cur Breeders Association may not seem like the world's best resource for a politician hungry for votes, but Brown was quick to correct me. ""We've got 18,000 members,"" he said. One of them, who he says he met at a squirrel hunt in Indiana, had even put an ad in a paper in support of Brown's candidacy. Since few papers printed the letter, few voters got a chance to read about Brown's stance on the issues. He gave me three definitive policy statements. The first: He wants to put Bibles back in public schools. ""I'm not a preacher, don't get me wrong. But the Bible says to beckon little children to come to me,"" he said. The second: Raise the state-wide speed limit to 80 miles per hour. ""If I can,"" he hedged. ""My state representative told me I could."" And the third: Use his salary to help out his fellow hunters. ""I'm wanting to buy some big deers and bring 'em in here and do away with our small buck deers. Buy some big buck deers and turn 'em loose."" From a distance, Brown would seem like an easy man to parody. He's not. During our hourlong conversation, he brought up a number of issues that made him sound more like a concerned citizen than a Southern stereotype. Brown said he had been in a union all his life, and was dismayed at the way his home state treated organized labor, including groups representing teachers and prison guards. He thought that the clear-cutting undertaken by the state's wildlife resources agency was putting that same wildlife in danger. And he brought up a number of potential scandals that he saw as disqualifying for Bill Haslam, including what he saw as a suspiciously lucrative land deal for a friend of the governor's. ""There's no banks in heaven,"" Brown told me, in response to the daunting personal wealth of his opponent, whose family fortune totals nearly $1 billion. How did a man who'd done no real campaigning manage to get 92,000-some votes? Like Mark Clayton--who the Tennessee Democratic Party successfully sued to keep off the ballot this year--Brown had an alphabetic advantage. He didn't win the Democratic primary because voters knew and liked him, it seemed, but because his last name was the first one listed on the ballot. The candidate with so little campaigning experience was eager to ask advice from a reporter with even less. ""How do I make a name for myself?"" he asked. I told him I didn't know anything about running a campaign. His best quality--the fact that he talked like a normal human being and not a politician--was also his biggest liability. As if to hammer home the point, Brown told me why his wife wouldn't like the third part of his three-point plan, the one about forgoing a salary in favor of purchasing some large deer. ""She's just after me constantly about buying a new truck, but I ain't doing it,"" he said. ""If I want to go to the mountains I go to the mountains. If I want to go to the lake I go to the lake. Nothing's wrong with the truck I have now."" Brown had started the night a political novice and ended it the same way. The difference was that he was now an actual politician. In November, Charlie Brown's name will be the one opposing the most powerful man in the state."	Meet Tennessee's Accidental Democratic Nominee for Governor, 72-Year-Old Hunter Charlie Brown
1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/scott_walker_re_election_can_a_bold_proud_conservative_sustain_triumph_in.html	"WEST ALLIS, Wisconsin--One of Scott Walker's duties as governor of Wisconsin is to open the state fair by going on thrill rides with the young woman anointed Fairest of the Fairs. ""We went on the Freak Out and she freaked out,"" he told a crowd several nights later at the 23rd annual Governor's Blue Ribbon Meat Products Auction, where Walker helped sell choice cuts to raise money for the 4-H club. ""And then the ride started to get slow,"" Walker continued, ""and she got the look on her face--'thank God it's over'--and I looked over at the operator who has been doing it the last three years I've been governor and I went like this""--the governor flashed a thumbs-up and a smile--""and he did it all over again!"" The governor had launched another round of spinning, dipping, and rolling (and the Fairest of the Fairs nearly freaked out of her sash). This is what Wisconsin elections are like in the Walker era. Just when one intense ride is over, another one starts right up again. Walker, who was first elected in 2010, is facing his third election in four years and his second re-election. His winning battle with unions over bargaining rights became the center of national political attention in 2011, leading to an effort to recall a group of Republican state senators. The next year, Democrats tried to eject Walker, who became the first governor ever to survive a recall. There was no election in 2013, but as if to make up for it, Walker's re-election has become more thrilling than expected. In recent polls, including two consecutive ones from well-respected pollster Charles Franklin of Marquette University, the battle-tested governor is tied with Mary Burke, a 55-year-old former executive at her family-owned Trek Bicycle Corp. whose only prior election experience was running for the Madison school board.* Her message is that Walker is too controversial and polarizing. ""What I see is politics before common-sense solutions to issues that we have,"" says Burke. ""I don't believe this partisanship, this divisiveness, is who we are."" It wasn't supposed to be this close. Last year the Republican and Democratic committees tasked with electing governors had been expecting the 46-year-old Walker to win re-election and start running for president. If he loses, it will almost certainly derail those plans. The outcome will also have meaning in the larger conservative movement, where Walker has been seen as proof of a governing philosophy: If you govern as a bold conservative and don't buckle under fire, you can win in a swing state--and not just any swing state, but one that's in a region crucial to the GOP's presidential fortunes. As Walker says in a campaign fundraising appeal for this election, his is a ""national success story"" and ""the conservative policies I championed are the blueprint for fundamentally reforming government."" When Walker weathered his battle with the unions, his stock among conservatives skyrocketed. Brian Schimming, vice chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party, remembers attending an out-of-state conservative function and a man asking in awe, ""What's it like living in the state with Scott Walker?"" Conservative columnist George Will was just as adoring. William Kristol saw Walker as a model. The night of the 2012 recall, Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell wrote: ""Tonight, Wisconsin voters rewarded political courage."" Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana also chimed in: ""Good policy is great politics."" Walker asserted that his 7-point recall victory had proved a simple formula. ""Results trump everything else,"" he told National Review last November. ""If you deliver, voters will stick with you,"" he said during the book tour for Unintimidated: A Governor's Story and a Nation's Challenge, which hinted at his larger ambitions. Update, Aug. 10, 2014: Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus held up Walker as a model Republicans should follow to win back the White House in a speech to conservatives. But now, though, voters are not sticking with Walker as much as he predicted. His approval rating is 47 percent today, (48 percent disapprove) even though 54 percent of those polled say they believe the state is moving in the right direction. Walker's supporters will say his rating still suffers from the knock-on effects of all the attacks during the recall--except that Walker's approval rating was near 50 percent before the recall. It may be that those who voted for him during the recall were not fans of Walker or his policies but thought the recall was too extreme. (Thirteen percent of self-described liberals voted for him in the recall, according to exit polls.) This election is a truer test of the Walker theory. It would be easier to test Walker's claim that his conservative policies attracted nonideological swing voters if there were a lot of those voters in the state of Wisconsin. As Craig Gilbert of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel laid out in his wonderful series on polarization in the state, Wisconsin is purple not because it has a vast population of intermingled viewpoints; it is instead a state where deep red lives next to deep blue. In this election, the number of voters who are up for grabs--who haven't come to a settled view about Walker, and who are likely to turn out in a nonpresidential year--is likely to be low. The Walker team's strategy is to rely on his rock-solid support among likely Republican voters and to pick up a small number of independents who will give him the benefit of the doubt. Incumbent governors don't usually lose, and at least some swing voters have now voted for Walker in two elections. In the Marquette poll, 7 percent of the respondents approved of the job Obama was doing and the job Walker was doing. ""An incumbent governor running for what is essentially a second re-election, with more money than God, has to be the odds-on favorite,"" Franklin says. Walker has $7.1 million in his campaign bank account and a considerable national network of donors. He built a list of donors from all over the nation defending against the recall, which became a pitched ideological battle. A recent report shows that he has received more out-of-state money than Burke, who has $1.7 million in her campaign chest plus plenty in her personal bank account--one of the key attractions of her candidacy for party officials. Burke put in $430,000 when she got into the race and has promised to spend more. Burke's strategy, with its emphasis on tempering partisanship, assumes there are a lot of swing voters who have been turned off by Walker's brand of politics. Burke's forces were heartened to see that in the Marquette poll, she and Walker were even with self-described independents, after she had trailed him by 9 in May--possible proof of concept. Burke will need those swing voters, because Democrats don't traditionally turn out the way Republicans do in nonpresidential election years. The goal for Democrats is to turn out some of the million or so ""drop-off voters,"" who participate in presidential elections but sit out the other ones. Hatred of Walker among liberals was not enough to help his Democratic opponent in the recall, and it might not be enough now. While in person Burke is passionate and commanding, she is not the type of ideological candidate who can ignite the base and rile up its various parts: union members, minorities, younger voters, single women. She has pushed issues like the state Constitution's ban on gay marriage, highlighted a voter ID law she says was designed to keep black voters from the polls, and says the right things about trade deals that hurt unions, but not with the same snap in her voice as when she talks about how competitive companies need smart long-term planning. When she tells her political origin story, it doesn't include pictures of Kennedy over the television set or visits to the shop floor. ""I grew up in a household where we were independents,"" she said in an interview. ""We didn't put labels on things--Democrat or Republican. We talked about issues, but how you're going to solve issues. That's who we are in Wisconsin."" Burke says that Walker is the reason for the polarization in Wisconsin; Walker's camp says the polarization existed before he got there. (Gore and Kerry barely won the state in 2000 and 2004.) The two strategies in Wisconsin echo a familiar discussion about the national political picture. If polarization is the new permanent condition of politics, that requires tougher partisan politicians who stake bold ideological claims, cementing their base and pulling just enough from the middle to win. The alternative view is that there is still a group of voters in the middle, and you can aim for them without losing your base. In the Republican Party, Chris Christie represents something closer to the latter view. Christie stresses his ability to work with Democrats. Walker doesn't do that so much. When Walker talks about solving problems in Washington, his prescription is single-party control, with Republicans occupying the White House and holding strong majorities in the House and Senate. Republicans see an opening in Burke's base. She is still undefined with voters. Forty-nine percent said they either haven't heard enough about her or don't know if they have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of her in the most recent Marquette poll. Republicans believe that if they can upset the image she is trying to sell to Democrats, they will weaken her turnout. ""She is a great candidate in the laboratory,"" Schimming says. ""But is she who she says she is?"" Fliers dropped at union households introduce the Harvard-educated Burke as ""A Middle-Class Success Story"" and the great-granddaughter of farmers. The Walker forces want to portray her as a wealthy hypocrite, which is why Walker ran ads tying Burke to outsourcing practices at Trek. ""I believe the Democratic Party platform is not in favor of outsourcing,"" says a strategist working on the race. Republicans have been making an issue of Burke's wealth, talking up her expensive vacations and second home. Some Republicans, such as Sen. Ron Johnson, are nervous that such attacks seek to demonize wealth, but the Walker campaign is willing to take that risk. With such a close electorate, Republicans believe they need to open only a small crack in Burke's base. ""All we need is a few points,"" Schimming says. At noon each day for the last two years, a group of anti-Walker voters have gathered in the rotunda of the State Capitol to sing songs. It is an ongoing protest against both his policies and the police efforts to keep them from gathering during the heated fights earlier in Walker's term, when the Capitol was packed with protesters. This past Monday, there were a dozen singing ""This Land Is Your Land"" and modifying the lyrics to include shots at the incumbent. ""Scott Walker will never push us out/This house was made for you and me,"" they sang. On ""We Shall Overcome,"" they modified the lyrics to ""Walker won't be governor, someday, someday soon!"" The singing is a testament to vigilance and faith-keeping, but it's also a symbol of the challenge facing Wisconsin's unions: There is a faithful, vocal opposition to Walker among their ranks, but will it be enough to mobilize on Election Day? ""No one in the union movement will forget what Scott Walker did to us,"" says Stephanie Bloomingdale, the secretary-treasurer of the Wisconsin AFL-CIO. If that's so, then Burke should have lots of help mobilizing her base with the strength of the union behind her. If not, it will be yet another blow for the movement that also sees Walker as a national symbol: as an inspiration for governors across the country to seek limits on union rights. The race is a test for the unions as much as it is a test for Walker's theory of political leadership. The test is not just about raw power in a state where both sides have solid turn-out-the-vote operations, honed after so many battles. It's about what messages might move voters in any state. Can a Republican be brought down by close association with the Koch brothers? Can opposition to the union be turned into a greater argument about a lawmaker's empathy? ""You're beginning to see a shift when voters are asked 'Who cares about you?' "" says Bloomingdale, ""and that's starting here in Wisconsin."" In the Marquette poll, 45 percent say that ""cares about people like you"" describes Walker. Forty-nine says it does not. Burke does better with the voters who know her--with 7 percent more thinking she cares about them--but 30 percent don't know her well enough to form an opinion. The campaign debate has now focused around jobs. The Burke campaign is running an ad showing Walker during his first race promising he will create 250,000 jobs. He hasn't: Wisconsin lost 1,700 jobs in May and June of this year. ""We're dead last in job creation in the Midwest,"" says Burke, who is making her 70-page jobs plan and pledges of fiscal conservatism the centerpiece of her campaign. Walker says he was just pushing the state to achieve high goals when he made that campaign promise. Wisconsin has created 100,000 jobs on his watch, he says, and the unemployment rate has dropped from 7.7 percent to 5.7 percent. Neither candidate has a clean shot. Burke has had to use fake math to attack Walker, and the governor defends himself with a little sleight of hand too. Burke, he says, will take the state back to the days of job losses under Walker's predecessor, Jim Doyle, whom Burke served as commerce secretary. ""We see a shift of losing 130,000 jobs to gaining more than 100,000 jobs,"" Walker says. ""We see a shift of 230-some-thousand jobs."" The creative math makes Walker and his team often sound like Barack Obama did in 2012, pointing out modest improvements and offering caveats. Meanwhile, the Burke team sounds like the Republicans who regularly pointed out that the unemployment rate was not as low as Obama's economist Christina Romer had promised in a document. There are many styles of leadership in the Republican Party. Ted Cruz gives speeches and takes firm stands but doesn't accomplish much of weight; he's toxic in swing states. Chris Christie has accomplishments he can point to in the blue state of New Jersey, but conservatives don't trust him. Walker talks like a conservative and has accomplishments to show for it. In the most recent Marquette poll, 66 percent said he was a governor who gets things done. But Walker is not making any promises on the order of 250,000 jobs for this election. His agenda is ""to build on what we've started,"" which means a conventional mix of tax cuts and lower spending; he's also frozen tuition at the University of Wisconsin. He's not running on the same kind of bold program that has made him a conservative icon. But if he is re-elected, surviving the political battle will reanimate Walker's status as a conservative risk-taker. That penchant for risks is always just below his affable surface--as Kaitlyn Riley, the Fairest of the Fairs, learned on the Freak Out. ""He's much more of a thrill seeker than I ever thought."" *Correction, Aug. 11, 2014: This article originally misstated that Mary Burke is on the Madison County school board.

2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/lamar_alexander_defeats_joe_carr_a_tough_2014_for_tea_party_challengers.html	"MURFREESBORO, Tennessee--The final day of the last Tea Party-against-the-machine campaign of a disappointing year began with a Fox News interview. Joe Carr, the three-term state representative running against Sen. Lamar Alexander, arrived early to Koch's Bakery (no relation to the billionaire industrialists) in Chattanooga, where correspondent John Roberts asked what it would mean if the insurgent got whupped. ""It will be because, we, this campaign didn't do everything we needed to do the get our message out,"" said Carr. A few dozen people trickled in and out of the bakery, taking photos with the candidate, talking about why he deserved to win, as his daughter wrangled media and took photos for the campaign's Twitter feed. Michael Scallia, the owner of a family shoe repair business, smiled at the scene from beneath a cap with the Gadsden flag emblazoned above the brim. ""Lamar has violated his oath to the Constitution so many times over the years,"" he said. ""He's voted against the people and with the government."" Carr, argued Scallia, was ""pro-life, anti-Obamacare, all the good stuff,"" whereas Alexander had cast an unforgiveable vote. ""He's voted for Obamacare,"" said Scallia. ""In the Obamacare, gun control was attached, like an earmark. Anything that takes my Second Amendment rights away is a major blow."" This was not actually true; that a voter believed it was a signal of what Alexander had to put up with, and what a restive conservative base has come to think about its Washington representatives. It was the reason half a dozen Republican senators had to fend off challengers in 2014, and why more than $100 million had been spent on these intraparty scuffles. Surely, it was the reason why Alexander, who has not lost an election in Tennessee since 1974, spent the final week of the campaign crossing the state on a bus, joined by many of the Republican politicians who had endorsed him--i.e., almost all of them. Alexander opposed the Affordable Care Act, but disagreed with the 2013 strategy to defund it--the fight that began the government shutdown. That was enough to embolden local Tea Parties to hold meetings and a convention, and get behind a challenger. Alexander opposed every one of 2013's gun safety bills, but he voted for cloture to begin debate on them. That was enough to turn the National Association for Gun Rights against him. Oh; and Alexander voted for 2013's immigration reform bill, which is lost somewhere in John Boehner's office and rediscovered only when conservatives roll it up to slap one of its supporters in the face. Carr, a burly 56-year-old with short white hair and a trim beard, made his name on the right by passing new restrictions on illegal immigration. After then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor lost his primary to a professor named Dave Brat, the same forces that backed Brat--radio hosts Laura Ingraham and Mark Levin, to name the most famous--dubbed Carr the next shock upsetter. In Chattanooga there was no sign of a Carr surge. No one had actually released a reliable public poll of the race since January, long before Carr got his national media attention. In Koch's, he sat down with me to talk about what had almost happened the day before in Kansas, where Sen. Pat Roberts had survived a Tea Party challenge from radiologist Milton Wolf. ""It was 48-41, is that right?"" Carr asked. That was right. ""That just shows you that the pollsters are wrong in their methodology and their sample,"" said Carr. ""They blew it pretty bad in the Dave Brat race. Nobody, nobody in their right minds believes that Lamar Alexander has had anything like a 30-point lead in this state. It's not very professional for a pollster to put out numbers without crosstabs. Hey, I can put out a memo--Joe Carr does a poll, he's winning with 80 percent of the vote! What we needed to do, with great discipline and perseverance, was build a ground game. We knew at some point in time in the 2014 election cycle, there'd be one event that just""--he held his hands close then threw them apart--""exploded on the scene."" This, according to Carr, was Dave Brat's victory. ""We were in Obion County,"" he said. ""I was speaking to about 80, 85 people, we were about done. Somebody waves his iPhone in the back of the room--Dave Brat just beat Cantor! And the place just exploded!"" There's no denying it--when Brat won, a press corps that had slept on the race scrambled to see if any other Brats were out there. Carr got the first sustained media attention of the post-Bratt Tea Party field and a run of national TV interviews. Laura Ingraham, who had stumped for Brat, flew in for his largest rally, ripping Alexander apart for advancing the immigration bill, occasionally mentioning Carr. ""I like metaphors,"" Carr explained at the bakery. ""You know Pink Floyd, right? Another brick in the wall. Sarah Palin was a brick in the wall. Dave Brat was a brick in the wall. Laura Ingraham, Mark Levin--they were bricks in the wall. What's the mortar? It's our message."" Carr got up to talk to more voters, to pay for everything they'd ordered, and then to hotfoot it to a plane that would take him around the state. (He'd raised more than $1.3 million, roughly a dollar for every six Alexander had.) On the way out, he was stopped by a local Republican who'd immigrated legally from Ecuador. He stopped for almost five minutes, refusing to pander or just slip away from the conversation. ""For every dollar that an illegal puts into the economy,"" he explained, ""two dollars come out of the public trust."" Then he had to leave. Two hours later, and a two-hour drive away, a much larger crowd packed into a family restaurant in the town of Oak Ridge. Sen. Lamar Alexander's operation was as slick as Carr's was homey, with a black bus parked next to campaign signs that aides were plucking out to be distributed at the next stop. Alexander worked through a crush of local Republicans, which included Gov. Bill Haslam, the former mayor of Knoxville, who was happy to share his political base. Alexander spared no schmaltz. ""When I get close to an election,"" Alexander said to his crowd, ""I look to Lamar Alexander's Little Plaid Book for inspiration."" He wore plaid. His team distributed plaid signs and stickers. And he whipped out his forgotten plaid book of campaign homilies from his second presidential campaign, 15 years ago. ""I've got a new rule,"" said Alexander. ""It'll be rule No. 312. If it's three days before a campaign, don't believe anything new you hear about anybody. If it's about me and about guns, remember that I have an A rating from the NRA. If it's about life, remember I'm endorsed by Right to Life. If it's about immigration, remember that I voted against amnesty."" Alexander's Republicans roared their approval. ""And last week, I flew back to Washington to vote against the president's immigration bill!"" The year's other Tea Party targets had lacked this combination of cornpone and relevance. Alexander had cast exactly the wrong votes for the Tea Party, but he was not distant; he did not, like Thad Cochran, seem like he was being propped up to run one last time, after forgetting when the election was. ""I don't know anybody who's happy with Washington, D.C.,"" said Alexander. ""I'm not happy with Washington, D.C. I'm running to change Washington, D.C.!"" He would, for example, help a Republican Senate ""begin to reverse Obamacare"" and ""begin to reverse the trend toward a national school board."" What did that mean? It recalled another issue that Alexander had angered the Tea Party over--his apparent acquiescence to Common Core, the top-down but state-approved education standards. After the rally I asked if he had been referring to Common Core. Not really--that's not what conservatives resented. ""I think what they resent is the fact that Washington may be requiring states to set specific education standards,"" said Alexander, who served as secretary of education after serving as governor of Tennessee. ""That's not Washington's business."" Alexander was saying the right words, basically. It was clear why this race had not gone as volcanic as Mississippi's, or Kansas', or even Texas' odd shadowboxing between Sen. John Cornyn and Rep. Steve Stockman. Neither Alexander nor Carr was making it personal. Carr said that the wounds suffered by Tea Partiers in Mississippi's runoff ""would take a long time to heal."" But he wasn't turning his campaign into the revenge mission. Not long after Alexander's rally, Carr's plane delivered him at another bakery--in Knoxville this time. Tennessee state Sen. Stacey Campfield, who had recently compared submission to Obamacare to submission to Nazi butchers, joined Carr for a few rounds of aimless voter chats. The senator rejected any idea that a close race would change Alexander's behavior. ""Second place is first loser,"" he said. A voter, Lillian Williams, wanted to show Carr a picture she'd taken--a sign she saw on the road to the airport. In white letters on a blue background, it read, ""No Mas Lamar."" Carr's campaign had nothing to do with it, like it had nothing to do with Tea Party Patriots branding the senator as !Lamar! But he shook with laughter at the photo, pulling over the local TV crews so they could get a picture of him with the photo. Alexander finished the race with an outdoor rally in boiling heat. Carr finished with a thank-you at his Murfreesboro headquarters, about 30 minutes south of Nashville. Election Day broke with no real expectation that Carr could win. ""The liberal media in general has this fetish about declaring the Tea Party dead,"" said Ben Cunningham, leader of the Nashville Tea Party, taking a midday break. The local Tea Parties had organized early, after being inspired by the people who elected Ted Cruz and beat Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar in 2012, but ""the cavalry never showed up,"" and the media was going to describe this loss as the first clean establishment sweep since 2008. ""I suppose it makes them feel better about the future,"" said Cunningham. ""But if Lamar survives tonight, it won't be a surprise. We mounted a good challenge and there's a chance that Joe can win this. If he does, we'll be ecstatic. If he doesn't? That's OK. We'll come back into it when Bob Corker runs again."" But that would take four years. In the short term, Carr would lose. The Carr party, held in one of the smaller ballrooms of an Embassy Suites, featured a bluegrass band but zero TV or computer screens. Curious partisans who wanted news on the night's other races had to borrow a reporter's computer or walk a few paces to the party of Jim Tracy, a state senator running against incumbent Rep. Scott DesJarlais, who had encouraged an ex-wife to terminate her pregnancies. Somewhere up the highway in Nashville, Alexander gave a victory speech that the Tea Party never saw. They also missed the news from Knoxville that Stacey Campfield had gone down in a landslide to a Republican who might make be less inclined to compare the president's health care program to a Nazi scheme. But they crowded as the bluegrass band played Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah,"" and cheered when Carr talked about what an important, positive race had just been run. Ultimately, it looked as though he would finish within 10 points of Alexander, who might not even get 50 percent of the vote--a far cry from that Alexander internal poll that was predicting a 29-point landslide. ""While this battle was lost tonight, this wasn't the most important battle,"" Carr said. ""It wasn't the first battle and it won't be the last battle."" Then he quoted the Declaration of Independence, and then he walked offstage into a group of believers who wondered who could be primaried next."	A Tough 2014 Primary Season for Tea Party Challengers Ends With a Near-Miss

Rand Paul left the stage, the applause died down, and the leaders of Young Americans for Liberty had a problem--there was time to kill. A panel of liberty-movement congressmen was en route to Northern Virginia from the Capitol, where they'd just held late votes. So Jeff Frazee, the 31-year-old who has led YAL ever since it was spun off from Ron Paul's 2008 campaign, came onstage to introduce ""a good friend of the cause."" ""I'm sure everyone here is Facebook friends with him,"" said Frazee. ""If you're not, you should be. ... He's been very helpful with the growth of our mission, and our message. I think he's a very articulate gentleman."" With that, Frazee brought out Jack Hunter. One year earlier, when Hunter still worked for Sen. Paul, the Washington Free Beacon dug through everything he'd published as ""the Southern Avenger,"" a truth-teller in a Confederate flag luchador mask. According to the younger Hunter, John Wilkes Booth's heart was ""in the right place,"" and whites had lost the ""right to celebrate their own cultural identity."" Americans worried about keeping their country were not ""wrong to deplore the millions of Mexicans coming here now."" Paul stood by Hunter for more than a week, until he resigned and Paul could distance himself from his former aide's ""stupid"" oeuvre. Hunter scaled back his participation in that year's YAL conference. But now he was back, onstage, in front of hundreds of people who'd just finished chanting for Rand Paul to run for president. ""Tell some jokes!"" said Frazee. ""They don't want to hear those,"" said Hunter. ""They're pretty bad."" The story of Jack Hunter's comeback is the story of the Pauls, a political family with survival skills that rival the Road Runner's. The 2008 discovery by James Kirchick of Ron Paul's race war survivalist newsletters did not force the elder Paul from that presidential race. The media's rediscovery of that material, in late 2011, did not stop Paul from amassing delegates in 2012. An ""establishment"" campaign to stop the younger Paul from winning his 2010 Senate nomination, meanwhile, failed completely. The Kentucky senator arrived in Iowa this week as one of the most popular figures in the GOP, the leader of the party's outreach attempts to black voters and young voters on issues like civil liberties and drug war reform. Since leaving Paul-world, Hunter has become the creative force behind a thriving conservative news site. In April 2013, Cox Media launched the website Rare, hoping to create a libertarian news site along the lines of what the Huffington Post has done for liberal readers. Rare puttered along with low traffic in its early days--at the start of 2014, the site reportedly had fewer than 1 million unique views per month. Staffers who'd hit the exits were dishing about a broken product model and rudderless editorial team. Then came Jack Hunter, who had churned out populist commentary for years--from radio, to YouTube videos, to Ron Paul's 2012 campaign blog. In those days he had become popular enough to, well, work for Rand Paul and co-write one of his books. In November 2013, after his resignation, Hunter published his ""confessions"" in a long piece for Politico Magazine, in which he denounced all of his works as the Southern Avenger. ""Libertarian Republicans are changing minds and changing the party,"" he wrote. ""They changed me."" This led to a conversation with the people behind Rare. Hunter had always imagined a libertarian-focused news site to compete with the Drudge Report. ""Some of the libertarian stories were finding an audience that they wouldn't have found before,"" he said. ""I'd remember, even on Ron's campaign, I'd see a story and say: Why isn't this a headline?"" Hunter had actually been plotting out this new libertarian media strategy before anyone thought to dig through the Southern Avenger's archives. For years, before and after joining the Paul campaign, Hunter had been in a running dialogue with the liberty movement. In January 2013 he responded to critics who thought he had ""propagandized"" for Ron and Rand Paul. ""I will remain a 'propagandist,' "" wrote Hunter, ""for... any other figure, group, blog or vehicle, now or in the future, that I believe advances our ideas in a way that we eventually become the new mainstream."" This sort of material attracted readers--much of what's written about the Pauls and their movement gets solid traffic. Eventually, Leon Levitt, VP of strategy at the Atlanta-based Cox, began ""a conversation"" with him about how Rare might go. ""[I] needed to personally become comfortable with his views and who he really was,"" Levitt said. ""He essentially convinced me."" On Jan. 20, Hunter returned to political commentary with a pair of posts that the Southern Avenger never would have written. One compared the NSA abuses revealed by Edward Snowden to the targeting of the civil rights movement. ""As we remember Martin Luther King, Jr. for his civil rights triumphs,"" wrote Hunter, ""let us also remember his civil liberties lessons."" The other explained how Sen. Mike Lee and--yes--Sen. Rand Paul were battling the ""new Jim Crow"" by working to reform drug laws. For Paul, wrote Hunter, ""mandatory minimum sentencing reform has become a primary issue and he has been outspoken about the inherent racism of the current system."" Rare became Hunter's site. ""He's essentially the editor,"" says Levitt. Copycat conservative opinion was replaced by viral stories about marijuana legalization, the right to tape-record police officers, gun-toting citizen vigilantes, and, naturally, the adventures of Rand Paul. Traffic finally started to tick up. According to data collected by Quantcast, Rare was attracting just 1.3 million unique users as recently as April, but was up to 6.2 million by June. It dipped slightly in July, but the site had found a niche, with liberty-flavored Rare links going viral on a regular basis. ""Initially we tried to be a lot of different things to different people,"" says Levitt. ""We made good and bad decisions, but truthfully, what we always wanted to represent was the liberty approach."" On Aug. 1, the third day of YAL's conference, about 300 students and activists listened and scribbled notes as Hunter explained that ""the Ron Paul Revolution lives on."" ""[Ron Paul] turned countless minds toward the ideals of liberty in a way no politician ever had,"" he said. ""Liberty, actually, was the only philosophy that truly appealed to millennials."" ""If keeping gay marriage illegal is the defining issue of our time, young people don't want anything to do with that,"" said Hunter to a modest burst of applause. ""If keeping marijuana illegal is what it means to be a Republican, young people don't want anything to do with that either,"" he said to louder applause. Then came the kicker: ""If you're worrying that black and brown people are invading the country and taking it over--young people simply don't want anything to do with those ideas or rhetoric."" It was the biggest applause line of the speech up to that point. As the cheers subsided, Hunter added a footnote: ""A lot of conservatives, including me in the past, have been guilty of such rhetoric."" When the speech ended, Hunter grabbed a chair in a common area, kicked up his black cowboy boots, and reflected on Rare's success. It's the ""premiere site for where conservatism is headed,"" he said. ""I remember being on talk radio and saying those things I regret,"" he added. ""I remember--God--all I wanted for president [was] someone who didn't want to get us into the next war, and someone who would stop the illegal immigrants who would ruin the country. But being part of the Ron Paul campaign. ... I saw that they didn't give a crap about any of that stuff about immigrants. It doesn't matter. It makes us worse people. They influenced me."" Hunter, who's now 40 years old, discussed how he used to talk more flamboyantly because it made him sound more credible. The Southern Avenger website has now been memory-holed, its content available only with Web archive searches. ""I really shifted my views over a couple of years,"" he said. ""What millennials believe, the sort of politics they're attracted to, is minus a lot of those ugly aspects of conservatism. The way some people talk about the migrants on the border, calling them drug dealers--these are children! They're not all gang members. It blows my mind that these family-values, allegedly Christian people are doing the most un-Christ-like things imaginable."" The next day, YAL's conference was set to end with a speech from Ron Paul himself and an after-party at a nearby bar. Jeff Frazee was pacing the conference area, making sure the Tea Party Patriots-sponsored dinner had arrived, the audio equipment worked, and the stage could be struck while Paul spoke in a ballroom. A PA was playing Neil Young's ""Rockin' in the Free World"" when I asked Frazee why Hunter had bounced back and Rare had become so successful. ""What happened to Jack was an obvious attack by the neocons,"" said Frazee. ""What he's written and said in the past had been out there, but they finally did their research and saw an opportunity to attack Rand. Now, some of the things he said were like--really, he said that? But now he'd never say something like that."" Shortly after 6 p.m., the YAL crowd filed into the ballroom where Ron Paul would speak. Jeff Frazee came onstage with his son--""William, the Ron Paul baby""--and said that the presidential candidate had influenced his life more than anyone outside his own flesh and blood. Jack Hunter took a seat at the back of the room, between a few friends from the movement, and posted a picture of the view to Facebook. ""Watching Ron Paul speak to a standing room only auditorium packed with young people for what I think is about the 578th time,"" he wrote. ""Never gets old."""	Rand Paul's Former Aide Has the Survival Skills of the Road Runner--Also of Ron and Rand Paul
4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/07/mississippi_gov_phil_bryant_blames_obama_for_the_state_s_uninsured_some.html	"Like most Republicans, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant is an Obamacare refusenik. A staunch opponent of the law, he rejected the Medicaid expansion, refused to build an exchange, and won't encourage Mississippians to enroll in the federal backstop. All of this is why, according to a recent report, the number of uninsured in the state has grown since last year, when Obamacare went into effect. As of this month, Mississippi has an uninsured rate of more than 21 percent, a 3.34 percentage-point increase over the previous year. By contrast, West Virginia--a similarly poor state that took the opposite approach--has seen its uninsured rate decline from more than 17 percent to an estimate of less than 7 percent, a slightly more than 10-point drop. Obviously, the bad news made its way to Gov. Bryant. But rather than take responsibility for the consequences of his policy choices, Bryant set a new standard for chutzpah and blamed President Obama. ""If statistics show that the ill-conceived and so-called Affordable Care Act is resulting in higher rates of uninsured people in Mississippi,"" said Bryant, ""I'd say that's yet another example of a broken promise from Barack Obama."" So Obamacare's namesake is responsible for the fact that you can't be bothered to assist your least well-off residents? It's a hilarious and pathetic attempt to evade responsibility, if not that surprising; on Thursday, after withdrawing a bill for additional border funding, House Speaker John Boehner slammed Obama for not taking further action, as if he's responsible for the GOP's failure (this, the same week the House authorized Boehner's lawsuit against the president for allegedly overstepping his authority). But the important point isn't that Bryant is incoherent, it's that his inaction--and the inaction of other red states--was predictable. Any time the federal government delegates anti-poverty policy to the states--from Medicaid and food stamps to Temporary Aid for Needy Families and unemployment insurance--some states embrace the programs, providing decent (or even expansive) services, while others adopt the least generous approach available. Conservative readers might quibble and argue the opposite, that--in the words of a recent Atlantic piece from Richard Epstein and Mario Loyola--a ""relentless expansion of federal power"" has replaced the "" 'laboratories of democracy' with heavy-handed, one-size-fits-all solutions,"" turning the states into ""mere field offices of the federal government."" This is ... exaggerated. Take Medicaid. Yes, it has federal requirements for funding. Expansion aside, if a state doesn't follow the rules, it loses its share of Medicaid funding. But these rules are basic, and amount to a simple agreement to provide health insurance to the poor. (Indeed, the kind of state that would begrudge requirements like covering adults with children is probably not the kind of state that would build its own insurance program absent federal action.) Outside of the basics, however, states have considerable discretion in how they tailor their programs. In keeping with their histories as low-tax, low-service states, places like Alabama and Mississippi have aimed for the minimum, providing as little as possible to poorer residents. Neither state offers benefits to childless adults, and both extend benefits only to people far below the federal poverty line (23 percent of the line for Alabama and 29 percent for Mississippi). That captures the poorest residents, but it excludes tens of thousands of poor and low-income households who make no more than a few thousand dollars. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a family of three in Alabama has to earn less than about $4,500 to become eligible for Medicaid. Anything more and they can't use the program. Other states--like Louisiana, Kansas, Texas, and Virginia--have similarly low eligibility requirements. These high bars (of sorts) are all but designed to keep as few people on Medicaid as practical, despite the obvious costs of low-income families and communities having no insurance. Overall, the flexibility of Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act allows stingy states to ""innovate"" by keeping benefits as low as legally possible. And the same is true of TANF, which--like Medicaid--allows for broad discretion among states. In a 2012 study, the Urban Institute illustrated this with case studies from California, Washington, Michigan, Florida, and Texas. California provided a platform ""of extensive education and training opportunities,"" and Washington tried to ""make work pay."" Their income threshold for cash assistance (at the time, $1,203 a month and $1,122 a month, respectively) was much higher than their peers' ($393 a month for Florida and $401 a month for Texas), and their actual assistance was more generous, too. Compared with many states, California and Washington provide actual safety nets, versus the programs in Texas and Florida, which seek to remove recipients as quickly as possible by providing as little as possible. Ultimately, the result of variation and flexibility for TANF has been a hodgepodge of programs across and within states. ""[T]here is no national TANF program,"" the Urban Institute pointed out, ""but rather a different program in each state."" For as much as this might be desirable in some places, it also poses serious problems in others. ""Its capped block grant structure,"" a feature it shares with Rep. Paul Ryan's anti-poverty proposals, ""meant that federal funding did not go up with the increase in need as it did for SNAP and Medicaid. States, caught in a deep fiscal hole, were not able to increase their resources in response to need."" Our so-called laboratories of democracy weren't there when people needed them the most. If your goal is to enhance federalism and encourage state experimentation, these aren't huge issues. It's why block grants have been a recurring feature of Republican policy reform, from ""Government for Tomorrow""--a 1965 pamphlet from the Republican Governors Association and the Ripon Society--to, again, the new plan from Ryan. (He calls them ""opportunity grants."") But this comes with clear disparities in state-to-state assistance--it's far better to be poor in Massachusetts than North Carolina--and real weakness in the face of recessions. By contrast, if your goal is a little less abstract--if it's simply to provide adequate assistance for as many people as possible--then these hoops are unnecessary. Maybe we want the states to be field offices for Washington, which--for all its faults--does a pretty good job of cutting checks. That's not to say there isn't virtue in the ""laboratory"" idea; different states do have different needs on a variety of issues. But poverty in Virginia doesn't look that much different from poverty in New York, and there's no need to pretend otherwise for the sake of federalism. I'll be honest. In a real sense, this is taking safety net programs out of the hands of voters (or at least, voters who participate in state government elections), and shifting power toward bureaucrats in Washington, which will come with real tradeoffs in responsiveness and accountability. With that said, our existing federal safety net programs are relatively well-administered by Washington, and Congress can still make substantial changes to their shape and operation. (See last year's major cuts to food stamps.) What's more, we shouldn't ignore the tradeoffs of conservative policy: The more autonomy you grant to individual states in anti-poverty policies, the less coverage there is for low-income Americans. This isn't a hypothesis. Thanks to the Supreme Court, millions of low-income Americans languish in states that refuse to expand Medicaid. (I'll add, as an aside, that it's no coincidence that the majority of these people are low-income blacks living in the South.) The simple fact is that some states just aren't interested in running a social safety net. Let's mock Gov. Bryant's excuse-making on the rise of his state's uninsured. It's absurd and hilarious. But let's also remember that his choice is only possible because we allow states too much discretion in administering the welfare state. On a whole constellation of issues, federalism has its place. But when it comes to sending help to poor people, let's set it aside."	The Sad Reality That Some Red States Can't Be Trusted to Take Care of the Poor
5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/07/legalized_prostitution_there_s_no_way_to_end_demand_for_sex_work_so_why.html	"Whom is it safe to hate? One of the reasons the cause of same-sex civil marriage has gained so much ground in recent years is that it is no longer socially acceptable to hold gay couples in contempt. Many if not most opponents of same-sex marriage harbor no ill will toward lesbians and gays, yet opposition to the expansion of civil rights for gay people has long profited from deep-seated prejudice against them. As this prejudice has grown less common and less intense, it isn't terribly surprising that proponents of same-sex marriage have gained the upper hand. Similarly, opposition to cannabis legalization has long rested on the belief that stoners are losers who can and should be kept on the margins of society. Now that marijuana use is associated in the public mind with cancer-stricken grandmothers and foxy celebrities, there is no going back. The stigma against marijuana use is dying, and support for keeping marijuana illegal has been slowly dying with it. Sex work is a different story. The stigma associated with selling sex remains strong, as is the stigma against buying it. This is despite the growing evidence that decriminalizing the buying and selling of sex has significant public health benefits. A pair of economists, Scott Cunningham and Manisha Shah, recently found that when Rhode Island accidentally decriminalized indoor prostitution due to a quirk of statutory language, cases of female gonorrhea plummeted, as did the number of rape offenses. A recent study drawing on data from Vancouver, British Columbia, found that the decriminalization of sex work has the potential to greatly reduce the spread of HIV. So will Americans soon start clamoring for legalized prostitution? I doubt it, because it's going to be very hard for people to stop looking down on those who buy and sell sex. There is relatively little polling on how Americans feel about legalizing the buying and selling of sex. The main reason, presumably, is that outside of a few rural counties in Nevada, the idea seems exotic, strange, and very far off the political radar. Back in 2012, however, YouGov found that legalization was surprisingly popular: While 48 percent of respondents said that prostitution should definitely or probably remain illegal, 38 percent of Americans said it should definitely or probably be legalized, with the remaining 13 percent on the fence. Far more respondents maintained that prostitution should ""definitely not"" be legalized (31 percent) than that it definitely should (12 percent), and this intensity of opinion does matter, as we've learned from the debate over gun rights and other hotly contested issues. Intriguingly, a substantial majority of women (57 percent) opposed legalization, while only 40 percent of men felt the same way. There is one important question that the YouGov poll didn't ask. I wonder whether, for those who believe that sex work should be illegal, it's more important to protect society from sex workers--on the grounds that they spread moral turpitude--or to protect sex workers from their clients--on the grounds that those clients are dangerous. The former is more like the traditional view of the prostitute--the woman of loose morals who tempts otherwise upstanding men into betraying their families. The latter is a view that has taken hold in a number of countries that have pursued new strategies for the regulation of sex work. In 1999 Sweden criminalized the purchase of sex while continuing to allow individuals to sell it. The new legislation was justified on the grounds that violence against women is inherent in sex work, and its stated goal was to reduce the prevalence of prostitution by deterring potential clients. (Let's pause here to note that, of course, not all sex workers are women and not all their clients are men.) Champions of the Swedish approach maintain that their goal is to ""end demand,"" and the Swedish government has been fairly successful at promoting its approach internationally. The Swedish model, with its emphasis on discouraging sexual transactions, isn't all that popular with sex worker advocacy groups. The Global Network of Sex Work Projects and the Canadian Alliance for Sex Work Law Reform have both warned that the Swedish model has marginalized sex workers without reducing prostitution. No matter the country, and no matter its laws, men and women will buy and sell sex. Given that reality, there is little reason to believe that criminalizing the buying of sex will make prostitutes safer. Rather, it could push the practice further underground, where protections are harder to come by. While the regulation of sex work hasn't been a high priority for Americans in recent years, Canada has drawn inspiration from the Swedish model. In December of last year, the country's Supreme Court ordered Canada's Conservative Party government to devise a new set of rules and regulations that would do more to protect sex workers. As a consequence, the Canadian government recently followed Sweden by introducing legislation that would, among other things, make it very clear that prostitution was to be discouraged and deterred. Yet the new Canadian bill would go further than the Swedes do by making it illegal for sex workers to advertise their services, or to communicate their interest in selling sex in a place where a child might plausibly see or hear that communication. Earlier this summer, Canadian sex workers took to the streets in protest. Their argument, again, is that these supposed protections don't actually protect women. ""This will simply move sex workers out into more isolated and more marginalized areas of the city, and in many ways this legislation is a gift to sexual predators,"" the head of a sex worker assistance group called Maggie's told the Canadian Press. ""It means they can't work in groups to watch out for one another and say, 'I'll be back in half an hour.' And people who would do women harm, who would do sex workers harm, will know this."" Nevertheless, it's easy to see why the Canadian government has decided to go this route. Legalizing prostitution appears to be somewhat more popular in Canada than in the United States. An Angus Reid survey conducted in June found that Canadians were split 45-45 on whether buying sex should be legal. But the gender gap on legalization was yawning: Fifty-six percent of men believe that buying sex should be legal, while 55 percent of women believe that it should not be. Canada's Conservatives attract far less support from women than men, and embracing the Swedish model seems like a shrewd way to shore up female support for the party by uniting feminists and social conservatives. What should worry Canadians is that the fundamental premise of the Swedish model--that it is possible to ""end demand""--is profoundly flawed. As Melissa Gira Grant, author of Playing the Whore, has argued, sex work is best understood as a service industry job. One of the more discomfiting facts about the modern market economy is that it's not just sex workers who are selling the illusion of intimacy. Few would deny that being conventionally attractive and mildly flirtatious would help you earn more tips as a server in a restaurant. Indeed, we have reliable evidence that these qualities help women and men alike earn more in a wide range of professions. Sexiness aside, there are many jobs in which it pays to be caring and attentive. Paid emotional labor of this kind is central to the entertainment and hospitality sectors. And as the population ages, more and more households outsource the work of meeting the needs of young children and aging parents to professionals, for whom a central part of the job description is to be, or to appear to be, warm and loving. Something similar is true of sex workers, who provide a real service to clients who, for whatever reason, find themselves in need of paid sex. This is not to suggest that johns are morally praiseworthy. One imagines that many of the men who purchase sexual services find themselves unable to experience physical intimacy via other means, in which case it is cruel to assume that their motives are necessarily predatory. And then there are men who are wary of investing every sexual encounter with emotional significance, and who appreciate the transactional nature of sex work. It's not entirely clear that it is preferable for these men to manipulate their way into getting the casual sex they crave rather than have them pay for it. Suffice it to say, I haven't exhausted all of the imaginable reasons why one might choose to purchase sex--the world's oldest profession has stood the test of time for a reason. (Or rather, a whole bunch of reasons.) ""Ending demand"" is a pipe dream, as Sweden has demonstrated in its decade-and-a-half-long effort to do so. The arrival of the Swedish model to Canada should give us pause here in the United States. We should listen to what sex workers in Canada are saying about the consequences of criminalization, and look at the positive results in Rhode Island when that state accidentally decriminalized indoor prostitution. If legalizing sex work really does decrease the rate of sexual assault and the spread of venereal disease, as the latest evidence strongly suggests, we need to have a much better reason for banning it than the fact that we hold prostitutes and johns in such low esteem."	It's Time for Legalized Prostitution
6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/07/republicans_back_away_from_the_call_to_impeach_president_obama_the_gop_understands.html	"Last week, House Republicans huddled in a Capitol conference room to figure out what kind of emergency immigration bill they might be able to pass. In his telling, Florida Rep. Ted Yoho wanted the party to jam the White House, to pack the bill with new border security measures and threaten to impeach Obama if he ignored them. ""He either enforces the laws on the books--as he was hired and elected to do--or he leaves Congress no option,"" crowed Yoho to Breitbart.com. ""This is not our choice, this is the president's choice and I would advise him to uphold the law on the books."" That wasn't out of character for Yoho; for most of the past 12 months, he'd been calling on his party to impeach Attorney General Eric Holder. In 2011, before he was even elected to Congress, he delineated six reasons to impeach the president, from ""the unconstitutional Nationalization of GM and Chrysler"" to taking ""commands from the U.N. or NATO."" Yet on Tuesday, just a few days after the Breitbart story, Yoho was leaving another House Republican confab, carrying a cup of coffee, and being pelted with questions. Most of the questions came from the Washington Post's Robert Costa, who asked what Yoho thought of the Democrats now raising funds on the specter of impeachment. Costa then found himself drawn into an accidental Socratic dialogue. ""Why would you impeach a president?"" Yoho asked the reporter. ""What are the reasons?"" ""You tell me,"" said Costa. ""I'm asking you,"" said Yoho. ""I'm trying to get a sense of what people think is an impeachable offense--perhaps his move on immigration,"" said Costa. ""I think that's one of many. Again, go back to why you impeach a president."" ""Can you inform me a little more?"" asked Costa. ""You asked me,"" said Yoho. ""And I'm asking you a question."" The congressman and the reporter went several more rounds until Costa chose not to answer the hypothetical question about why a president should be impeached. ""Then I guess I don't know either,"" said Yoho. ""I mean, come on, you know--it's high crimes and misdemeanors. Not following the Constitution. Has he violated those oaths? Has he not faithfully executed the laws of our land?"" ""So he should be impeached?"" asked Costa. ""I'm not saying that,"" said Yoho. Had someone gotten to Yoho? Why, yes. In the weekly meeting, Oregon Rep. Greg Walden got up to talk his colleagues out of mentioning impeachment. Walden, who leads the National Republican Congressional Committee, reported that the other party's House campaign group had raised $2.1 million via emails warning of impending impeachment. (New York Rep. Steve Israel, who runs that group, confirmed as much.) ""He said, and the speaker reiterated, 'We're not going there,' "" said Louisiana Rep. John Fleming. "" 'We're not interested in that, there's no way it would be successful. Most of this discussion is coming from the White House, and there's no reason to talk about it.' "" Fleming was on board with the omerta, which developed over the weekend, after White House officials started talking about impeachment with Brer Rabbit glee and new House Majority Whip Steve Scalise gave a word-salad answer to an impeachment question. On Tuesday, after the conference meeting, Speaker John Boehner told reporters that ""impeachment"" was ""a scam started by the Democrats at the White House."" It wasn't. If impeachment is a scam, it was started on the right, early in the Obama presidency. Some of its early adherents believed in it; some thought they were merely responding to the passions of constituents; some, obviously, wanted to raise money. At the start of this summer, the conservative book-publishing industry churned out two new tomes about why Republicans needed to start an impeachment conversation, to stop pretending that it was crazy to accuse the president of high crimes and realize that it was consistent with the rest of the party's arguments. Republicans mostly refused to listen. Then, on July 8 of this year, came Sarah Palin. Her PAC (this is important--see above, re: fundraising) placed an op-ed at Breitbart.com, announcing that the time had come for the I-word. For inexplicable reasons, Palin can still shift a news cycle; in a lucky synchronicity, the Senate campaign of Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley chose July 8 to release a tape of his opponent calling for impeachment. Nothing will stop a movement quite like the other party noticing it. ""Should Obama be impeached?"" had been a slam-dunk kook-spotting question for years. But House Republican leadership was ruling it out. The only people talking about impeachment, in real time, were members of the Congressional Black Caucus denouncing the threat from the House floor. Meanwhile, helpful (and anonymous) aides were reminding people that Boehner had resisted--prophetically!--when the Republican Congress of 1998 put all of its chips on impeachment and the Clinton scandals. (Boehner later overcame that resistance and voted for all four articles of impeachment.) All of this allowed the GOP leadership to pull a rare kook-switcheroo. In mere hours, the ""impeachment"" drive was being covered as what Boehner said it was--a Democratic scam, or at best a scammy arms race. ""[White House senior adviser] Pfeiffer has denied Obama the moral high ground on impeachment,"" wrote National Journal's Ron Fournier, who devotes most of his jottings to the question of why Obama can't lead. ""Yes, Democrats will say that Republicans started it. But why lower your party to the GOP's level? Why lower the presidency?"" In the White House briefing room, ABC News' Jonathan Karl went after spokesman Josh Earnest for the lucrative meta-trolling campaign. ""Did you coordinate your comments on Friday about impeachment with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee?"" Karl asked. ""Pfeiffer says something, you say something, then they have a fundraising drive which they're saying is one of the most successful fundraising drives of the cycle."" The message even filtered down to WorldNetDaily, the conservative news site that sells both ""Honk for Impeachment"" and ""Lights on for Impeachment"" bumper stickers. It was running stories about Boehner's declaration and about Rush Limbaugh seeing through the Obama grift. ""CNN and other drive-by media are going to report this--not as something Obama is trying to make happen--they're going to report this as something the Republicans want to happen so that they get creamed by it even if they do nothing,"" said Limbaugh. ""Remember, there is no journalism anymore. There is only advocacy disguised as the news."""	The Conservatives Who Wanted to Impeach Obama Are Pretending It Was the Democrats' Idea

The young PR operation's 18 workers do their typing and designing and debunking next to a blown-up version of that 2011 photo in which the former secretary of state is checking her BlackBerry on a flight from Malta to Tripoli, behind dark sunglasses. That photo inspired the Texts From Hillary Tumblr, and was painted on the Ready for Hillary PAC's bus before it started schlepping around the country. It's kitsch from Clinton's finest hour, from the postelection, pre-Benghazi period when a pundit could call her ""a great secretary of state"" and hear no coughing or guffawing. A few steps away, past the shelves full of David Brock's books--his 2002 memoir of the conservative movement he left, and the much less heretical 2012 The Fox Effect--sits American Bridge's president, Brad Woodhouse. American Bridge is the permanent campaign that's currently trying to save the election for Democrats. Correct the Record, launched in November 2013, is a subsidiary focused on the next election. Both organizations live to fight Republicans, just as Media Matters--the Brock project from which all of this grew--lives to rebut ""conservative misinformation"" in the press. But Media Matters and American Bridge respond to everything. Correct the Record has only one mission. In an interview with David Freedlander, Brock said he dreamed up the project after Republicans held hearing after hearing on Benghazi. ""There was no, or limited, capacity for her to deal with the range of attacks,"" he said, referring to Clinton. In October, Brock co-authored a book titled The Benghazi Hoax, and within weeks Correct the Record was there to insist that ""Hillary Clinton was the 'most on top of the situation' on the night of the attack."" I dropped by the Brock-verse a few weeks after the release of Clinton's memoir Hard Choices. The conventional wisdom is that the tour could have gone better--more book sales, fewer verbal somersaults about her wealth and gay marriage stance. Correct the Record wants everyone to know that the media blew it. It had been sending out weekly updates of Clinton book sales, because there was a story out there that she was flopping. The first memo, from July 2, ran to more than 4,000 words, and insisted, ""Critics have praised the authenticity and insight of the former Secretary of State's new memoir"" and that ""Hard Choices sold more in its third week than Rand Paul and Jeb Bush's books did total, combined!"" (Exclamation point in the original.) Woodhouse wants me to appreciate the long game that CTR is playing. They don't just do rapid response, though of course they're ""very good"" at it. ""You can hand people a list of 100 Hillary Clinton accomplishments, or 30, or whatever, from the State Department or her life, and nobody's even reporting on them,"" says Woodhouse, sitting behind his two computer screens and a TV tuned to MSNBC. ""They're reporting on whether she had a gaffe. But one thing Correct the Record is doing is citing and placing a lot of op-eds, putting surrogates out on TV, to talk about her accomplishments. And all that stuff is going to be somewhere for someone to use later on."" Right. It's not like CTR can force the media to use this material. It can only politely inform the press that it's falling for right-wing spin. CTR's own spin has described an attack on the Clintons' wealth as an attack on the ""profoundly American success and philanthropy of Bill and Hillary Clinton,"" and criticism of her speaking fees as ""relentlessly attacking Hillary Clinton for raising money for universities."" If this came from an actual campaign, reporters would choke on the chutzpah. But it doesn't. It comes from a small group led by Burns Strider, who happened to be a senior adviser to the 2008 Clinton campaign, and who argues that Clinton's book tour was an unqualified win. ""The great thing about the book tour, from my vantage point, as a guy from Mississippi who's worked all over the country, is that Secretary Clinton hasn't gone out with a giant stash of canned answers,"" says Strider. ""She doesn't go out with a tested message. She's talking from answering and reacting to questions. You look at her town hall on CNN, on Charlie Rose, she's had an incredibly successful couple of months chatting with the American people."" If you gaze too deeply at Correct the Record, you start to wonder if you've been too critical of the Clintons. That is by design. The outfit has studiously avoided intrigue and invited plenty of reporters into the inner sanctum. (This piece is at least the third that begins with a tour of the CTR bunker, though each reporter got a different estimate of the total staff--from 16 to 18 to 20.) Strider will even discuss how the organization might fend off attacks if Clinton draws a challenge from the left. ""If Clinton chooses to run,"" he says, ""she's gonna articulate her record for the future and I'd be very surprised to find it not much in line with her friends from the left."" And Brock is happy to describe what he learned in his wild days as a right-wing hack, and why the facts brought him to liberalism and the defense of the Clintons. In Blinded by the Right, he describes in detail how the right first turned on him when his reporting for a Hillary bio turned out nuanced instead of vitriol. ""Back when I wrote The Seduction of Hillary Rodham, I wrote something to the effect that I thought her potential as a political leader was such that she might end up being a more historic figure than her husband,"" remembers Brock. ""I think the potential is still there. I try to make sure, through our work, that she gets a fair hearing, and that the media environment isn't clogged with misinformation."" Brock goes through all of the hits on Clinton, and explains why they fizzled--why they were predestined to fizzle. What about the Benghazi attack, the one that led to Correct the Record's very existence? ""The Benghazi issue is almost like birtherism at this point,"" says Brock. ""I don't think it's doing real damage. If it's a question of where Benghazi sits in the mainstream discourse, it's largely been contained. I think we had a fair amount to do with that."" How about the Washington Free Beacon's report that dredged up--with fresh audio--the story of a young Hillary Clinton defending a child rapist? ""It was very misleading in the way it was presented, and wrong,"" says Brock. ""So again, I don't think ... "" He pauses. ""It got some attention and broke through to some extent, but when real reporters looked at it, it fizzled."" And what about the current wave of Clinton books? Correct the Record tears through them, but has discovered that they need little rebutting. No one in the mainstream media (excluding Fox News and the New York Post) did much with Ed Klein's Blood Feud and its mysteriously sourced quasi-scoops. Daniel Halper's Clinton, Inc., released a month after Hard Choices, was the sort of book a young Brock might have written, with named sources backing up some of the best stories. But it was no real threat to Hillary. ""I don't believe it's going to succeed as well as other conservative books in the marketplace,"" says Brock. ""The basic approach he seems to take is that he will give you a page or two of essentially rumor or speculation, that a lot of us who are plugged into the world have heard. Then he backs out of it with various caveats. I think he doesn't deliver the kind of red meat that an Ed Klein has delivered. The conservative audience--it doesn't do caveats. And as far as its reach into mainstream conversation, there hasn't been much pickup. Reporters don't feel like any new ground has been plowed there at all."" I ping Halper and tell him what Brock thinks of his book. In no time at all, Halper points me to the rules of Clinton PR that he identified in his reporting, and identifies this as No. 3: ""make any allegation unfavorable to the Clintons"" into ""old news."""

On Sunday, the Times editorial board began a six-part series on marijuana legalization with an op-ed titled ""Repeal Prohibition, Again."" ""It took 13 years for the United States to come to its senses and end Prohibition,"" writes the Times. ""It has been more than 40 years since Congress passed the current ban on marijuana, inflicting great harm on society just to prohibit a substance far less dangerous than alcohol."" From there, the newspaper's editors hit the points common to any argument for legalization. ""We believe that the evidence is overwhelming that addiction and dependence are relatively minor problems, especially compared with alcohol and tobacco,"" it argues, noting the scant evidence that moderate use is harmful to ""otherwise healthy adults."" And while the Times is relatively silent on thornier issues with legalization--like the consequences of greater marijuana intoxication on public safety or the difficulty of crafting an effective regulatory regime--the broad point is sound. We can handle a world of legal marijuana--and the costs of not trying have proven too great. An element that looms large in the Times analysis is the disparate impact of marijuana enforcement on blacks and Latinos. From 2001 to 2010, according to a 2013 report from the American Civil Liberties Union, blacks and whites had roughly equal rates of marijuana use, with small variations from year to year. Among young people ages 18 to 25, usage rates were higher for whites, and overall, more blacks than whites say they've never tried marijuana. Nevertheless, blacks are 3.73 times more likely than whites to be arrested for marijuana possession, with an arrest rate of 716 per 100,000 for blacks to 192 per 100,000 for whites (compared to a national average of 256 per 100,000). What's startling is that the total marijuana arrest rate has increased by nearly one-third since 2001, while at the same time, the rate for whites has remained constant, a sign that blacks account for the bulk of new arrests. And this dynamic is persistent across the country, from Washington D.C.--where the arrest rate for blacks is 8.05 times greater than for whites--to Alaska, where it's ""just"" 1.6 times greater. Nationally, nearly one-half of our 1.7 million drug arrests are for marijuana possession. It's true that few marijuana arrests result in prison time. Roughly 40,000 state and federal inmates have current marijuana convictions, and the majority of those are for sale and distribution. ""Less than 1 percent ... are serving time for marijuana possession alone--and in many of those cases, the possession conviction was the result of a plea bargain involving the dismissal of more serious charges,"" write drug policy scholars Beau Kilmer, Jonathan P. Caulkins, Mark A.R. Kleiman, and Angela Hawken in Marijuana Legalization: What Everyone Needs to Know. But even if they don't lead to prison, these arrests bring people into the criminal justice system. ""A simple arrest for marijuana possession can show up on criminal databases as 'a drug arrest' without specifying the substance or the charge, and without clarifying even whether the person was convicted,"" notes law professor Michelle Alexander in The New Jim Crow, ""These databases are then used by police and prosecutors, as well as by employers and housing officials--an electronic record that will haunt many for life."" The ACLU, for example, provides the story of one Texas man, Nick Smith, who spent three months in jail for possession. Obviously, federal marijuana legalization would put an end to a world where simple possession can derail a person's life. But legal weed--and more importantly, a legal market for weed--won't do anything for the individuals and communities wrecked by our aggressive and disparate enforcement of past marijuana laws. What's more, it's troubling to think of the distribution of profits in an America of legal weed. Thanks to their criminal records, many of the young black men who were victims of marijuana policy won't have a chance to capitalize on the new permissive environment. Opportunities will go to mainstream businesses, run mostly by well-off white Americans. That's been the situation in Colorado (where blacks are 1.9 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession) where marijuana was legalized in 2012 following a statewide referendum. It's not hard to find the demographics on the state's pot entrepreneurs, who--like many new business owners--rely on loans and personal wealth to get their start, an avenue unavailable to many people of color. For these marijuana entrepreneurs, Colorado is a vibrant market for turning a profit. According to a recent report from the Colorado Department of Revenue, statewide demand for marijuana is at 121.4 tons a year, a 31 percent increase from previous estimates. Indeed, in its first four months of legal marijuana, the state collected $11 million in taxes from commercial pot and $7 million from its medical cousin. It's not hard to imagine a national market for marijuana that reaped billions of dollars in sales and generated hundreds of millions in tax revenue, with little going to the communities most affected by past prohibition. In Colorado, voters have earmarked weed revenue for school improvements and other local services. Let's say America follows suit and adopts the state's model for legalization and commercialization. What should we, as a country, do with our marijuana windfall? The easy answers are the usual services and benefits: food stamps, unemployment insurance, medical benefits, and tax cuts. But we should think deeper. If we legalize marijuana, it won't just be for new revenues and savings. In part, it will be because we recognize the tremendous injury we've done to countless young men and women over decades of unfair enforcement of the law. Consider Attorney General Eric Holder's decision to sidestep mandatory minimums on minor drug charges. ""Although incarceration has a role to play in our justice system, widespread incarceration at the federal, state, and local levels is both ineffective and unsustainable,"" he said. ""It imposes a significant economic burden--totaling $80 billion in 2010 alone--and it comes with human and moral costs that are impossible to calculate."" I wouldn't be shocked to hear similar language from pro-weed politicians if marijuana legalization becomes a major national issue. We can't always heal injury, but we can acknowledge and compensate for it. Any plan for legalization should come with a plan for reparations for those communities most damaged by our misguided war on marijuana. That doesn't mean individual payments--the logistics are too difficult--as much as it does policies for affected communities, from job training and educational services to something like My Brother's Keeper, all funded by a surtax on marijuana sales and distribution. We can't wash our hands of our past mistakes. The war on drugs--and the war on weed in particular--has been a disaster and a burden for millions of Americans and their communities. We can't fix all of the damage, but as we wind down the conflict and liberalize our laws, we should do our best to make amends."	The Case for Marijuana Reparations
9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/07/inside_the_anti_obamacare_carnival_libertarians_are_celebrating_halbig_and.html	"The stilt walker was the first clue that something strange had come to Washington. A few long blocks from the Capitol, with the dome in full view, a colorless midsize tent was ringed by circus performers, waving and beckoning tourists into something-or-other. It was Wednesday evening, and the street traffic was sparse, but a few tourists made it in, where they signed in with one of a dozen red-shirted, iPad-wielding libertarian millennials. Then they were in--they'd made it to the Creepy Carenival. This was the big summer project of Generation Opportunity, the youth outreach group funded by at least $5 million from the Koch network to tamp down under-30 enrollment in health care exchanges. Over the fall and winter, they'd worked tailgates and raffled off iPads. Now, after weeks of promo, they'd find out if free food and circus games could be as popular as free beer. Perfect timing, too: The D.C. Circuit had just ruled their way the day before, arguing that Obamacare subsidies (which made health care plans affordable for middle- and lower-income people) were illegal in states that did not set up their own health care exchanges. After a good-size crowd had found the tent, Generation Opportunity's president, Evan Feinberg, took his place onstage. A tightrope-walking blade juggler took a respectful break behind him, straddling and listening, as Feinberg laid out the manifesto. ""Young Americans have been asked to pay as much as three times as much for their health care to get nothing out of it--to pay for an older, sicker generation's health care,"" said Feinberg. ""To pay for an intrusive bureaucracy that we can't trust."" The crowd, ostensibly, was learning about this through games administered by confused carnies. Under-30s who played the test-your-strength game were handed a plastic hammer that couldn't work right. A haunted hospital took them into a dimly lit health care future of cockroach-infested rooms, skeletons in waiting rooms, and a literal ""death panel"" that denied treatment before its bored-looking members (including ""Creepy Uncle Sam,"" the hydrocephalic viral star of GenOpp's videos) took a lunch break. On the way out--before signing another GenOpp signup form--gawkers had to walk past a hall of ""government health care"" outrages, from the Tuskegee experiment to military lobotomies. But outside, Feinberg was cheerfully proclaiming victory over Obamacare. ""When the administration spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to convince us to sign up--of taxpayer money, mind you--we didn't sign up,"" he said. ""They needed 40 percent of us; only 27 percent of young Americans thought it was worthwhile to do so. And that was when we were forced, with a penalty, to sign up."" Did the crowd buy it? Unclear. One family that I followed and chatted with grabbed some free food and watched an acrobat before splitting, telling me that they were happily covered by the breadwinner's job at a security company. A group of Air Force contractors who were taking a break told me that they were already against the law--it might cut into their Tricare one day--before they walked past the free cotton candy. But the Carenival will go on tour anyway, and Generation Opportunity is going to be with us for a while. In a month of legal setbacks for the Affordable Care Act, libertarian foes of the law have celebrated and pressed their advantage.  They are years into a sophisticated campaign of debating and gaslighting, aimed at making Obamacare unworkable through citizen boycotts and legal victories. It's been going well. Conservatives and libertarians--Americans for Prosperity, the Cato Institute--campaigned to stop states from setting up health care exchanges. After the 2012 Supreme Court decisions that allowed states to opt out of Medicaid expansion, the critics made sure that Republican-run states took the get-out-of-expansion-free card. And this week, after months of derision and disbelief, libertarians claimed the D.C. Circuit victory with the Halbig decision A case that had begun when a South Carolina attorney noticed that the ACA referred to subsidies going to exchanges ""established by a State""--not by the federal government, whose exchange ended up serving most of the people who got new insurance in late 2013 and early 2014--was picked up by libertarian attorneys at the Cato Institute, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, and the American Enterprise Institute. They'd won, and that had allowed even more sowing of doubt about a law that liberals thought they'd built a wall around. Not quite. Generation Opportunity is embracing the chance to portray the law as illegal and killable. ""I was working on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee when the law was passed,"" Feinberg said after his short speech, after Republican Rep. Paul Gosar took the stage to praise the event. ""Quite clearly the intention of these subsidies was to get states to set up their own exchanges."" The decision, he said, is ""one more thing that's going to make it hard for the law to be successful. But the law was doomed for failure."" The Carenival ran until 9 p.m., until it could be packed up for the tour. The next night, the Competitive Enterprise Institute threw a much smaller and more exclusive party in its downtown Washington office. Over appetizers and drinks (courtesy of the Distilled Spirits Council), victorious lawyers and policy analysts kibitzed about how far Halbig could go. CEI had played a role in finding and rallying plaintiffs, but there was plenty of credit to share. As the clock struck 7, three of the happy warriors were brought together to give short speeches on what they won. First up was CEI's Sam Kazman, the libertarian group's counsel, who read from the part of the Halbig transcript in which a judge mocked the government's insistence that the state/subsidies provision was merely a typo. ""They admitted that our case was only slightly less persuasive than that of the government,"" said Kazman. ""It's a close call. It's nice for them to admit it."" Kazman ran through a list of unsung heroes, from interns to the attorneys who spotted the hole in the law. The case, he said, matters for ""the whole notion of the rule of law and separation of powers. When you have an administration that's set on expanding the regulatory state to infinity and beyond, it's never been more important to judicially restrict the ability of agencies to rewrite the law."" Up next was Thomas Miller, a CEI graduate and current AEI scholar, who told a joke he'd been forwarded about a man pouring his heart out at confession. ""He tells the priest, 'Last night, I beat the crap out of an Obamacare supporter,' "" said Miller. ""The priest says, 'I'm here to talk about your sins, not your community services.' "" The crowd of a couple of dozen libertarians broke into I-can't-believe-he-said-that laughter. ""We don't take that approach here!"" said Miller. ""We just beat them in court. We're ready to forgive them for their sins if they're ready to move on to the hybrid health care system that people really want."" Up next was Michael Cannon, the Cato Institute scholar who wrote countless words in print and speeches to turn Halbig from daydream to reality. He remembered putting his first research paper online and declaring ""OK, world: Change!"" He paid tribute to the lawyers who actually changed it. Then he made a little fun of the media for asking him how he felt about winning. That was never the point. ""But someone did ask me, on the scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the day Obamacare passed and 10 being the day Obamacare is repealed, how did I feel?"" said Cannon. ""It took me a while to come up with an answer. Negative one. We have a president who thinks he can rewrite the law himself. That's much worse than just Obamacare."" Cannon was not pessimistic. There were plenty of libertarian lawyers and sensible judges who will hear the case. CEI's president, Lawson Bader, raised a glass and promised that there's ""Champagne to be uncorked in the near future."""	The Anti-Obamacare Carnival
10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/07/paul_ryan_s_opportunity_grants_the_wisconsin_republican_says_his_poverty.html	"On Thursday, speaking in front of a packed house at a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C., Rep. Paul Ryan unveiled his latest plan to overhaul how the federal government addresses poverty. At the center of the Republican's sweeping proposal was a pilot project that allows states to consolidate federal food stamps with 10 of the government's other, large-scale anti-poverty efforts into a single, supersized ""opportunity grant"" program. The GOP's reigning policy wonk explained to the friendly crowd that the move would cut red tape and give state and local officials the flexibility they need to maximize the impact of each federal dollar spent. ""My thinking is, get rid of these bureaucratic formulas,"" Ryan said. ""Put the emphasis on results."" The Wisconsin legislator also offered a second message to Democrats listening on Capitol Hill: Any state that opted into his pilot program, Ryan vowed, ""would get the same amount of money as under current law--not a penny less."" That promise was aimed at putting his colleagues across the aisle at ease and enticing them to join his reform-minded debate. The problem is that there's little to suggest that Ryan would keep his promise--in fact, history suggests he wouldn't be able to even if he wanted to. Ryan's deficit-neutral pledge doesn't extend any further than the specific, 73-page ""discussion draft"" (as he's calling it) that he was waving from the American Enterprise Institute podium. The three-hole-punched elephant in the room was another lengthy white paper the House Budget chairman wrote: his 2015 budget blueprint, released less than four months ago. That proposal called for $137 billion in cuts over the next decade from the federal food stamp program, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. A cut of that size--nearly a fifth of SNAP's current budget--would mean millions of low-income Americans would lose at least some, if not all, of their benefits. Pair Ryan's budget with his awkward (and arguably racist) entrance into the poverty debate earlier this year, and Democrats have every reason to be skeptical of the House Budget chairman's newest proposal. ""How do you seriously say you care about anti-poverty when you've spent the last several years cutting the safety net?"" Massachusetts Rep. Jim McGovern said in a conference call with reporters. ""Our skepticism comes from the fact that the person who is saying all these nice things has voted in a way that has made life for poor people more difficult."" But even if we set Ryan's voting record and budget proposals aside, there's still reason to doubt that his plan could deliver on its promise to leave the $800 billion the federal government currently spends on food stamps, housing assistance, and other social welfare programs untouched. That's because if you strip away the ""opportunity grant"" cover Ryan wrapped around his latest proposal, you're left largely with a traditional block grant program, whereby the feds hand over a lump sum of cash to the states to spend however they want within a relatively loose framework. That's a proposal Ryan has offered before, and one that has proved to be a nonstarter for Democrats. (Ryan bristled at the block grant comparison when a pair of otherwise supportive panelists made it during an AEI roundtable immediately following his speech, but the best the congressman could do in the moment was to say that what he has in mind isn't ""your garden-variety block grant where you cut a check to the states and call it a day."") That's because the accountability of Ryan's block grant switch comes with something he appears to covet even more: an end to food stamps as an entitlement program. Under the current setup, any American who qualifies for SNAP benefits receives them, regardless of how much money Washington has already spent on the program that year. But switching to a block grant would effectively set a cap on SNAP spending by stopping the program from automatically increasing along with need. That, critics warn, could leave the program unprepared and underfunded when the next economic downturn sends more Americans than expected scrambling to put food on the table. The best case for those who want to protect SNAP and other social welfare funding would be for Congress to freeze current funding levels for the foreseeable future. That technically wouldn't be a reduction in funding, but inflation would tell a different story. That's what happened to the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program during Washington's last attempt at major welfare reform. Since that program was block-granted in 1996, funding has remained pretty much flat at $16.6 billion per year while the program has quietly lost nearly one-third of its spending power to inflation. Under Ryan's proposal, food stamps would risk a similar fate. And that's not the only reason that the anti-poverty crowd should be nervous. As Vice President Joe Biden's former chief economist Jared Bernstein has already warned, once you put all of the social welfare programs in one package, you give lawmakers a single target to train their budget-cutting sights on. While Ryan's plan may not explicitly cut the social safety net, it would make it much easier for him and his colleagues to do so in the near future. Robert Greenstein, the president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, raises a second, related issue, namely that even if federal funding somehow did remain constant in an opportunity-grant world, total funding--that is from federal, state, and local levels combined--would likely still dwindle. Greenstein says that's because Ryan's program would ""afford state and local officials tantalizing opportunities to use some block grant funds to replace state and local funds now going for similar services."" Such decisions have proved relatively common under TANF since it was converted to a block grant. (Greenstein also raises a handful of smaller concerns with Ryan's plan here, including the possibility that local officials would look to spend some of the former SNAP cash on less pressing proposals favored by politically influential developers.) To be fair, Ryan's proposal contains a number of common-sense reforms that already have support from both sides of the aisle, things like sentencing reform and expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit. But if Ryan means it when he says he hopes his proposal kicks off a good-faith bipartisan debate about how Washington can better combat poverty, he's going to have to make it a more honest conversation than he did on Thursday. The 47 million Americans currently living off of food stamps deserve at least that much."	Paul Ryan Promises His Poverty Reforms Won't Mean Less Money for the Poor. Don't Believe Him.
11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/07/paul_ryan_s_anti_poverty_plan_is_paternalistic_it_s_also_a_thoughtful_compassionate.html	"Paul Ryan has just released a new anti-poverty plan, and it's a doozy. Though the plan is very much a work in progress--Ryan's team calls it a ""discussion draft"" to underline that it is not a final product--it includes some of the most thought-provoking ideas to have ever come from the halls of Congress, where ideas traditionally go to die. If you're a red-blooded American liberal who follows the news closely, you probably have a lot of preconceived notions about Ryan, the Wisconsin congressman and chairman of the House Budget Committee. You might think he's a wild-eyed Ayn Rand devotee hell-bent on dismantling the safety net, and that the top action item on his daily planner is to give to the rich and take from the poor, like a cackling reverse Robin Hood. While I can't speak to what Ryan does in his off hours, I can say that he does believe in the safety net, as he made clear in an address to the conservative American Enterprise Institute on Thursday. There are conservatives who accept the existence of a social safety net begrudgingly, as a concession to political reality that nevertheless offends their libertarian convictions. These are the guys who damn Franklin Delano Roosevelt while adjusting their monocles. And then there are those who, like Ryan, believe that a safety net in good working order is crucial to a healthy economy. Where Ryan parts company from most liberals is in his understanding of what it means for the safety net to be in good working order. Judging by this new plan, titled ""Expanding Opportunity in America,"" Ryan believes that poor families don't just need help--they need the right kind of help. Instead of railing against bureaucrats who meddle in the lives of the poor, he makes a case for caseworkers. Specifically, he floats the idea of ""Opportunity Grants"" that would allow a few brave states to step forward and redirect federal money that now goes to a panoply of social programs to more targeted efforts to lift people out of poverty for good. The cheapest and easiest thing that governments can do to improve the lot of poor people is to give them more money. Government can get a lot of things wrong, but it's generally pretty good at mailing people checks or zapping money to their EBT cards. Giving people money really does make them better-off: It's better to have more money to buy groceries and other basic necessities than less. But getting more money from the government doesn't really make you less poor. The federal government's official poverty measure, as Ryan's report reminds us, doesn't take into account most benefits, including the earned-income tax credit, rent subsidies, and food stamps. That leads many analysts to conclude that the official poverty measure is misleading--that it paints too dire a portrait of how poor Americans actually live. They're wrong. The official poverty measure is very useful because it focuses on how much people are earning.* Earnings are the route to economic independence because, unlike government benefits, they're not subject to legislative whims or confusing income cutoffs. Earnings are, after taxes, yours to keep and to do with as you please. They reflect what people are willing to give you for an honest day's work, not what a bureaucracy sends you because you could use the help. As Brink Lindsey, a scholar at the Cato Institute, has argued, ""paid employment is the most reliable path to commitment, engagement, and a sense of purpose,"" while joblessness keeps people on the margins of society, even if their basic material needs are being met. What's much harder than mailing checks is having people on the ground. Whether they're government bureaucrats or private providers, these people must understand the challenges that poor people face--both immediate problems, like a lack of cash, and longer-term ones, like a dearth of the skills one needs to become economically self-sufficient. The theory behind having smart, dedicated caseworkers working on behalf of people who are down on their luck is that spending a bit more time and money now could help save time and money later. If someone takes the time to understand your personal situation and the particular challenges you face, there's a better likelihood you'll have a successful outcome down the line. If all of this caseworker talk sounds paternalistic to you, you're on to something. Conservatives hate nanny-statism, and are always railing against the regulations that get in the way of entrepreneurs. When it comes to the poor, however, most conservatives lose their live-and-let-live attitude. The basic idea here is that if you're going to get help from the taxpayers, the taxpayers should have a say in how you use it. That is why conservatives are more likely to support food stamps, which can be spent only on food, and the earned-income tax credit, which gives an income boost to low-income workers, than no-strings-attached cash, even though a simple cash payment requires far lower administrative costs. There are a few people on the right who favor no-strings-attached cash over paternalistic welfare programs, like Charles Murray, the granddaddy of American libertarians and author of a terrific, well-argued, and ultimately pretty wrongheaded book called In Our Hands, which calls for replacing all social programs with a decent-sized cash payment to all Americans. By and large, though, conservatives take a libertarian view when it comes to people who can support themselves and a paternalistic view to those who can't. One interpretation of this split is that conservatives hate the poor and can't stand the idea of treating them with dignity. Another interpretation, which strikes me as closer to the mark, is that conservatives want people who can't support themselves to become people who can. The problem is that this is easier said than done, and it won't happen overnight, hence the need for some kind of safety net. The most controversial idea in Ryan's anti-poverty plan, at least as it stands right now, is that poor families should work with government agencies or approved nonprofit or for-profit service providers to develop a plan for achieving economic independence. But wait a second, you might say--Social Security beneficiaries aren't required to present a plan! Why should poor people be treated differently than workers who've been making Social Security contributions for decades, and who are collecting benefits at the end of a long working life? There's actually a pretty straightforward reason: Social Security is designed for old people. No two old people are the same, to be sure, but they all have the same basic problem: They are too old to work, or to work very long hours. That's a problem we can deal with. People with low or no earnings, in contrast, face diverse obstacles. Some need short-term help to, say, fix their car, which will allow them to commute to work, or to make a deposit on a rental apartment. Others don't have the skills they need to earn enough to support themselves and, for whatever reason, will have a very hard time acquiring them. Sure, you could give both kinds of people food stamps and call it a day. Or you could recognize that one-size-fits-all programs don't do justice to the ways in which individual circumstances vary. Ryan understands that poverty in America is not one big thing. It's not best understood as a dearth of government checks, or even as a dearth of compassion. There are as many different reasons for poverty as there are people living below the poverty line, and Ryan's call for more narrowly tailored anti-poverty solutions is one modest step toward recognizing that fact. This isn't to say that Ryan is right about everything. Remember, he's just issued a ""discussion draft""--he's not even sure that he's right about everything. But he is asking the right questions, and that's an excellent start. Correction, July 25, 2014: The paragraph about the federal poverty measure was revised to reflect that the measure excludes major non-cash benefits and tax credits, but not all subsidies. (Return.)"

Yes, this was far behind the median white household--which had a net worth of $134,992--but it was a huge improvement from previous decades, in which housing discrimination made wealth accumulation difficult (if not impossible) for the large majority of African-American families. By the official end of the recession in 2009, median household net worth for blacks had fallen to $5,677--a generation's worth of hard work and progress wiped out. (The number for whites, by comparison, was $113,149.) Overall, from 2007 to 2010, wealth for blacks declined by an average of 31 percent, home equity by an average of 28 percent, and retirement savings by an average of 35 percent. By contrast, whites lost 11 percent in wealth, lost 24 percent in home equity, and gained 9 percent in retirement savings. According to a 2013 report by researchers at Brandeis University, ""half the collective wealth of African-American families was stripped away during the Great Recession."" It was a startling retrenchment, creating the largest wealth, income, and employment gaps since the 1990s. And, if a new study from researchers at Cornell University and Rice University is any indication, these gaps are deep, persistent, and difficult to eradicate. In the study, called ""Emerging Forms of Racial Inequality in Homeownership Exit, 1968-2009,"" sociologist Gregory Sharp and demographer Matthew Hall examine the relationship between race and risk in homeownership. Simply put, African-Americans are much more likely than whites to switch from owning homes to renting them. ""The 1968 passage of the Fair Housing Act outlawed housing market discrimination based on race,"" explained Sharp in a press release. ""African-American homeowners who purchased their homes in the late 1960s or 1970s were no more or less likely to become renters than were white owners. However, emerging racial disparities over the next three decades resulted in black owners who bought their homes in the 2000s being 50 percent more likely to lose their homeowner status than similar white owners."" This wasn't a matter of personal irresponsibility. Even after adjusting for socio-economic characteristics, debt loads, education, and life-cycle traits like divorce or job loss, blacks were more likely to lose their homes than whites. If you're familiar with American history and housing policy, this shouldn't come as a surprise. The explicit housing discrimination of the mid-20th century has left a mark--arguably a scar--on the landscape of American homeownership. The combination of redlining, block-busting, racial covenants, and other discriminatory measures means that, even now, a majority of blacks live in neighborhoods with relatively poor access to capital and mortgage loans. What's more, this systematic discrimination has left many black households unable to afford down payments or other housing costs, even if loans are available. And in the event that black households are able to save and afford a home, they aren't as financially secure as their white counterparts. To wit, middle-class African-Americans are more likely to belong to the lower middle class of civil servants and government workers--professions that, in the last five years, have been slashed as a consequence of mass public-sector downsizing. All else being equal, a black schoolteacher who loses her job to budget cuts is less likely to have savings--and thus a safety net--than her white counterpart. But this isn't just a story of legacies and effects. In addition to showing the consequences of past discrimination, Sharp and Hall argue that African-Americans have been victimized by a new system of market exploitation. Banks like Wells Fargo steered blacks and other minorities into the worst subprime loans, giving them less favorable terms than whites and foreclosing on countless homes. In a 2012 lawsuit, the ACLU and National Consumer Law Center alleged that the now-defunct New Century Financial, working with Morgan Stanley, pushed thousands of black borrowers into the riskiest loans, leaving many in financial ruin. As early as 2005, the Wall Street Journal reported that blacks were twice as likely to receive subprime loans. And in a New York University study published last year, researchers found that black and Hispanic families making more than $200,000 a year were more likely to receive subprime loans than white families making less than $30,000. Together, all of this means that--according to Sharp and Hall--African-Americans are 45 percent more likely than whites to lose their homes. That means they're more likely to lose their accumulated wealth and to slide down the income ladder, and less likely to pass the advantages of status and mobility to their children. Apropos of that observation, recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows an incredible level of youth unemployment for blacks and Latinos. More than 21 percent of African-Americans aged 16 to 24 are out of work, compared with a national average of 14.2 percent. For black teenagers in particular, joblessness soars to nearly 40 percent. It's a catastrophe with serious economic consequences. The Center for American Progress estimates that the young adults who experienced long-term unemployment during the worst of the recession will lose more than $20 billion in earnings over the next 10 years. And given the slow recovery, odds are good they'll never recover those lost earnings. It's tempting to treat these as subsets of broader problems: poor assistance to homeowners and too much austerity. But they're not. Even during the boom economy of the 1990s, black employment lagged behind the national average. And the racial wealth gap is a persistent fact of American life. Likewise, the challenges of black homeownership are a function of discriminatory housing policy, as are a whole host of other problems, from mass incarceration and overly punitive policing to poor air quality and food access. These challenges are heavily location-dependent, which is another way to say they are heavily racialized and most prevalent in the segregated, working-class or low-income communities that characterize life for most African-Americans, even those with middle-class incomes. For reasons both political and ideological, it's nearly verboten in mainstream conversation to argue that racialized problems require race-conscious solutions. Knowing what we know about the demographics of foreclosures, for example, we should ensure any program to help underwater homeowners includes a specific measure to assist black victims of predatory lending, who may need additional help to get on sure footing. For more than anyone else, this is a message for liberals and progressives, who--for all of their racial sensitivity--are still reluctant to tackle the economic dimensions of racism, even as they represent the vast majority of nonwhite voters and draw critical support from African-American constituencies. It's how Elizabeth Warren could give ""11 Commandments for Progressives""--and receive huge applause--without mentioning the deep problems of racial inequality. One of her commandments is ""that no one should work full-time and still live in poverty, and that means raising the minimum wage."" But solving this problem for African-Americans and Latinos--who tend to live in areas that are segregated from job opportunities--is very different than solving it for whites. While conservatives and Republicans can play a role here, it's Democrats who are committed to reducing income inequality and bringing balance to our lopsided economic system. Success on those fronts requires a return to race-conscious policymaking, from programs to increase the geographic mobility of low-income workers--relocation grants for individuals or transportation grants for communities with a spatial mismatch between jobs and housing--to public works programs aimed at low-income minority communities, to race-based affirmative action as a way to boost a flagging black middle class. There's little in American life that escapes the still-powerful pull of past and present racism, and effective policymaking--to say nothing of effective problem-solving--requires a response to that racism. Otherwise, we entrench the same disparities for a new generation."	How the Great Recession Obliterated Black American Wealth

A few months later, he joined the Israel Defense Forces. On Sunday, he died fighting in Gaza, leaving behind his parents, who will now take their first trip to Israel to bury their 24-year-old son. There are many people to blame for Steinberg's death. There is the Hamas fighter behind the weapon that actually killed him. There are the leaders, on both sides, who put him in Gaza, and the leaders behind all of the wars between Israel and the Palestinians. I can trace it back to 1948, or 1917, or whatever date suits you and still never find all the parties who are responsible. But I have no doubt in my mind that along with all of them, Birthright shares some measure of the blame. Birthright was founded by Jewish philanthropists Charles Bronfman and Michael Steinhardt in 1999 ""to change the course of Jewish history and ensure the continuity of the Jewish people by strengthening Jewish identity, Jewish communities, and solidarity with Israel"" by sending young Jews on all-expense-paid trips there. The organization has been extremely successful: Birthright reports that more than 400,000 young Jewish men and women have visited the Holy Land on its dime, and research out of Brandeis University confirms that the trips are having the desired effect, producing a more-engaged Jewish diaspora with stronger ties to Israel. Though most trip alumni do not join the IDF (Birthright's spokeswoman told me they don't keep track), to do so seems like the ultimate fulfillment of Birthright's mission--the ultimate expression of a Jew's solidarity with Israel is to take up arms to defend it. A few years ago, Kiera Feldman wrote about Birthright for the Nation and described ""the mifgash""--a multiday portion of the trip during which Israeli soldiers join the group as a way to create a bond between young diaspora Jews and their IDF peers:"	What Makes an American Kid With Shaky Hebrew Decide He Is Ready to Die for Israel?
15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/iraq_airstrikes_the_u_s_had_to_intervene_because_isis_s_goals_are_absolutely.html	Scratch the surface of most of the world's armed conflicts and you won't see an ideological struggle or deep-seated ethnic or religious hatred that has erupted in a war of all against all. Rather, what you'll find is a collection of thugs for hire, some in uniforms and some not, who are taking advantage of the chaos of war to prey on the weak. Sometimes this involves stealing oil or diamonds, or sexual brutality. But it's pretty rare that it involves some larger design. True, the hooligans who take part in these orgies of destruction will often claim loyalty to some larger cause. They're usually lying. The only heroes you'll find in these wars are the people fighting for their lives and their loved ones. The war that is now unfolding in Iraq is something different, and something much scarier. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria steals with the best of them, and I don't doubt that some of the fighters who've attached themselves to its cause are thrill-seeking psychopaths like those you'll find in any lawless hellhole. On the whole, however, you get the impression that its fighters aren't killing for fun and profit, and they're certainly not killing to protect themselves from other crazies. Instead, they are killing because they are utopians. They want to live in a world that is quite literally cleansed of those who do not share their deranged beliefs, and by killing Yazidis and Christians and members of other religious minorities, they believe that they are serving a noble and just cause. The Taliban are awful, but given their willingness to cut deals with the Afghan government and the United States and its allies, they aren't quite so insane. Even al-Qaida is more tolerant of religious minorities than the lunatics of ISIS. Now, with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stolen loot, ISIS is on the march, closing in on stranded pockets of women and men they see as pagans and slowly starving them to death. The Kurdish peshmerga, the only Iraqi fighting force capable of holding ISIS at bay, has put up a brave resistance, yet they are starting to buckle. And now, without a moment to spare, President Obama has decided to do something. For months, the president has resisted committing U.S. military forces to the fight against ISIS. But ISIS's campaign of extermination against Iraq's religious minorities has stirred him to action. In a nationally televised address on Thursday night, the president announced that he had authorized a limited bombing campaign against ISIS as well as a humanitarian effort on behalf of the stranded Yazidis. Though I've criticized the Obama administration for withdrawing from Iraq at the tail end of 2011, I recognize that the decision to intervene militarily now is a thorny one. ISIS has succeeded in no small part because Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's government has failed to win the confidence of Iraq's Sunni Arabs, who've suffered mightily from his sectarian chauvinism. Coming to the Iraqi government's rescue looks a little too much like forgiving Maliki for his sins. Most of the defense wonks who've called for the president to come to Iraq's aid have insisted, quite reasonably, that Maliki first agree to build a more inclusive government that all Iraqis can trust and respect--a reasonable request given the stakes. Maliki's refusal to make meaningful concessions has made a large-scale intervention profoundly unattractive. But the prospect of genocide changes things. What President Obama understands, I hope, is that if ISIS succeeds in routing the Kurds and collapsing the fragile Iraqi state, there will be no end to the killing. American military power cannot make Iraq whole again. It can, however, help give the Kurds a fighting chance to beat back ISIS, and to establish a safe haven for the members of religious minorities fleeing from ISIS-held territory. And in doing so, it can buy time for Maliki to think hard about his legacy: whether to avoid sharing power he is truly willing to let Iraq once again become a slaughterhouse. By giving the Kurds breathing room, the president is doing the honorable thing. Throughout America's decadeslong entanglement in Iraq, it is the Kurds who have been our firmest friends. Right now, Kurds are fighting and dying to protect their homeland, yes, but also to defend Yazidis and Christians who cannot defend themselves. They are fighting for the entire civilized world, and for a country as powerful as our own to not lend them assistance would be genuinely shameful--not least because it is the U.S. invasion of Iraq that has contributed so much to that country's unraveling. I am a pessimist. Though I sincerely hope that the limited airstrikes authorized by the president will be enough to force ISIS into retreat, I don't expect this gruesome war to end tomorrow. We need to start thinking about the Yazidis and the Christians and the other persecuted Iraqis who will need to find shelter somewhere other than Iraq. The United States welcomed as many as 130,000 refugees from South Vietnam after the fall of Saigon in 1975. We might have to welcome just as many from Iraq in the years to come. 	The U.S. Had to Intervene in Iraq Because ISIS's Goals Are Absolutely Terrifying
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/08/gridlock_is_good_when_the_house_gop_stands_in_the_president_s_way_it_means.html	"President Obama is furious about congressional gridlock. In a press conference last week, he chastised the Republican-led House of Representatives for refusing to support the bipartisan immigration bill that was passed out of the Senate last June. ""The argument isn't between me and the House Republicans,"" the president said. ""It's between the House Republicans and the Senate Republicans, and House Republicans and the business community, and House Republicans and the evangelical community."" The president then insisted that intransigence on the part of House Republicans was forcing his hand: ""In circumstances where even basic, common-sense, plain, vanilla legislation can't pass because House Republicans consider it somehow a compromise of their principles, or giving Obama a victory, then we've got to take action."" This is part of a recurring pattern: With Republicans in control of the House, President Obama has found it all but impossible to move his domestic agenda forward through legislative means. And so, according to his conservative critics, he has stretched his powers to the limit via a series of executive actions. Josh Blackman of the South Texas College of Law has accused the president of using congressional intransigence as an excuse to ""suspend, waive, and even rewrite statutes."" In 2012, for example, the president announced a sweeping deferred action for millions of unauthorized immigrants who came to the United States as children. These women and men would be shielded from the threat of deportation, and they'd be allowed to apply for employment authorization. More recently, the Obama administration has reportedly considered extending this treatment to millions of other unauthorized immigrants whose relatives are U.S. citizens. Ross Douthat of the New York Times warned that by flouting Congress on immigration enforcement, the president is inching ever closer to ""domestic Caesarism."" To be sure, the president has his defenders. One of them, Slate contributor Eric Posner of the University of Chicago Law School, maintains that it is Congress, not the president, that is undermining constitutional norms. ""If Congress cannot pass any laws because of gridlock,"" Posner writes in the New Republic, ""then it has violated its obligations under the Constitution, and accordingly the president has the right to use his enforcement powers to implement policies that serve the public interest."" It is Posner's view that appears to come closest to the president's: If House Republicans are standing in his way, he's left with little choice but to take action. Let's leave aside the question of whether or not the president has the right to use his prosecutorial discretion to, in effect, accomplish by executive fiat what he can't via legislative means. Is it really true that Congress violates its obligations under the Constitution when it fails to pass any laws? I would argue to the contrary that House Republicans are taking their constitutional duties seriously, and that the congressional inaction the president condemns is in fact an indication that our democratic system is working. Consider the bipartisan immigration reform bill that passed the Senate yet has met with fierce resistance in the House. If you listen to the president, you'd think the only reason House Republicans would oppose the bill is that they are Obama-hating troglodytes. But there is another more plausible reason for them to oppose it. The Congressional Budget Office's analysis of the bill found that it would increase the U.S. population by 16.2 million between 2014 and 2033, over and above the roughly 20 million in net international migration already expected under the status quo. No one denies that the bill would increase legal immigration substantially, least of all its chief sponsors. This is despite the fact that while Gallup has found that 41 percent of Americans want immigration levels decreased, a mere 22 percent want to see immigration levels increased. Though the share of Americans who want immigration levels decreased has fluctuated over the last several decades, reaching a peak of 65 percent in the mid-1990s, the Gallup data show that the share of Americans who want immigration levels to increase peaked earlier this year at just 27 percent. The House of Representatives was designed to be the part of Congress that is most responsive to popular opinion. It's not at all obvious that members of the House are failing in their constitutional obligations when they are resisting a legislative proposal--even one backed by every significant business lobby under the sun, Michael Bloomberg, Mark Zuckerberg, and other enlightened billionaires--that increases immigration levels when doing so is extremely unpopular. The thing about congressional gridlock, as Josh Chafetz of Cornell Law School has observed, is that it is not actually a thing. Rather, gridlock is the absence of a thing, that thing being legislative action. Instead of fixating on why we have gridlock, Chafetz asks that we instead think about why we ever have legislative action at all. Bicameralism is in itself a big barrier to legislative action. Getting majority support in one chamber of Congress is hard enough; getting it in two is harder still. Moreover, the major players in federal legislation--the House, the Senate, and the president--have different, albeit overlapping, constituencies, and they operate on different electoral cycles. For a party to achieve unified control of Congress and the White House, it usually takes more than just a single swell of popular support. It often takes two or three. Chafetz argues that we can only expect legislative action, then, when there is a sufficiently broad public consensus to take a specific course of action. When this consensus is lacking, we shouldn't be at all surprised when the legislative machinery grinds to a halt. The reason the first two years of the Obama presidency were so transformative is that the double whammies of the Iraq War and the financial crisis led to two massive Democratic victories, in 2006 and 2008. President Obama and his allies translated those electoral wins into the most ambitious legislative agenda in modern memory. From the stimulus to Obamacare to Dodd-Frank, the first years of the Obama administration saw a frenzy of activity, despite the objections and concerns of Democrats representing moderate districts, many of whom were swept away by Republicans in the congressional elections of 2010 and 2012. One way of thinking about why President Obama has met with such intense resistance from congressional Republicans is that the president and his allies overinterpreted their mandate. By the time 2008 rolled around, there was a broad public consensus in favor of getting U.S. forces out of Iraq as quickly as possible, and on that issue, at least, conservatives found themselves on the defensive. Many once-vocal hawks suddenly fell silent. Yet there wasn't an equally broad public consensus in favoring of creating a new health entitlement program--a legislative effort that (barely) succeeded--or introducing a new cap-and-trade system--an effort that failed. Conservatives felt that they could oppose these efforts without risking defeat, and they were right. On immigration, similarly, President Obama is ignoring the basic fact that, while Zuckerberg and friends spend vast sums making the case for the Senate bill, an overwhelming majority of Americans either want to keep immigration levels exactly where they are or decrease them. The House Republicans for whom the president has so much contempt aren't always the most appealing bunch, and there is no question that they get many things badly wrong, as the more loose-lipped among them will happily tell you. There is a reason Congress' approval rating is even lower than Barack Obama's. On immigration, however, their refusal to play ball is ensuring that the wishes of ordinary Americans are being taken seriously. They are, on this issue at least, doing their job."

Scott Walker continues to take heat from fellow conservatives over his attacks on his Democratic opponent, Mary Burke. Two weeks ago, Walker launched a series of attacks charging that Burke benefited from outsourcing practices at Trek Bicycle, her family company where she was once an executive. A columnist for the Wall Street Journal slapped him for using a version of the same playbook Obama had used against Mitt Romney. Now a fellow Republican, Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, is leveling a similar criticism. In an interview Tuesday with editors and reporters at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the one-term senator said that he thought Walker and his campaign should drop the attacks. Johnson, a former CEO who spent millions on his own campaign, said he also disapproved of the Republican Party of Wisconsin, which has made an issue of Burke's wealth and dubs her ""Millionaire Mary."" ""Far too often in the political realm, we demonize success, we demagogue against it,"" he said. ""What we should be doing is incentivizing success."" Before Walker took the stage at the Wisconsin State Fair on Tuesday night, where he was helping to raise money for the 4-H, he addressed Johnson's remarks. ""You're not going to hear me or my campaign talk about it,"" Walker said, referring to Burke's wealth, ""and I'd prefer the party talk about the differences on jobs. I haven't gone after Trek, I haven't gone after Mary Burke, I haven't gone after her wealth at all. I could care less what her personal wealth is."" That's not quite so. Walker's campaign has also referred to Burke as ""Millionaire Mary"" a few times, and in his ad, titled ""Fortune,"" Burke is featured holding two bags full of cash. His point, according to Walker, is that Burke is a hypocrite. She attacks Walker administration programs that support companies that have used outsourcing, he says, even though the company she profits from has done the same. She promotes an increase in the minimum wage, but Trek benefits from foreign labor that averages $2 an hour. Finally, he says, she has attacked corporate tax loopholes, but Trek hasn't paid corporate taxes. Of course, that's because, like many companies, Trek pays taxes as an S corporation, whereby shareholders pay its federal tax via their own individual returns--a point Republicans know well because it's part of their argument for lowering personal income tax rates. ""I'm fine with a company that pays taxes via an S corp,"" Walker says. ""But she went after corporate tax breaks. One of her ads says 'corporate tax breaks'-- well, that's interesting, considering her company hasn't paid corporate income taxes since 1982. That's not saying she doesn't pay taxes. She pays them a different way."" This is slicing the bratwurst awful thin. What's beneath all of this is the Republican strategy to depress turnout in Burke's base. Wisconsin is a polarized state (read Craig Gilbert's masterful in-depth analysis here), and in a nonpresidential year, the number of swing voters in the middle is likely to be low. Walker, who has been through three elections and won a bruising recall fight, is well-known to everyone--which makes it harder to change perceptions about him. Burke, however, is not well-known. Almost 50 percent of voters said they had no opinion of her in the latest Marquette University poll. That means Walker has an opportunity to define her, and if he can do it in a way that weakens her standing with her working-class base, that lowers enthusiasm on the Democratic side. ""In that environment, you can see how attacks on Mary Burke become very attractive,"" says political scientist Charles Franklin, who administers the Marquette poll. Burke, who is nearly a political novice (her only previous elected office is a seat on the Madison school board), sticks up for her dad's company and appeals to hometown pride. She said in an interview that she finds it ""ironic that you have a sitting governor dragging a homegrown Wisconsin business through the mud when they employ nearly 1,000 people here and have been a great company since my dad founded it nearly 40 years ago. I'm really proud of the company and proud of my role in the company. I want to be a governor who celebrates the successes in Wisconsin regardless of people's political leanings."" Walker is no longer running the controversial ads and is now attacking Burke for her record as commerce secretary under his predecessor. Maybe he is backing off under pressure, or maybe he's already done the damage he needs to do. The last major poll of the race, showing a tie, came out before the controversy; the next one comes out at the end of August. Then we'll know if Walker's gambit worked--or the race will still be tied, and we'll know that the race will get even more heated."

There's no question that relative to their population, black Americans hold a disproportionate share of arrests and convictions for crime. But it's important we don't confuse that with a propensity for crime. Put another way, black overrepresentation in crime statistics has as much to do with policing and the legal process as it does with the actual crimes committed. It's worth noting that just a few hours after Riley made his assertion, the New York City medical examiner ruled Eric Garner's death a homicide by chokehold. If you haven't followed the coverage, Garner was killed in July during a struggle with Staten Island police officers. Because a witness (who was later arrested on gun charges) videotaped the encounter, we know that the 43-year-old father of six had just stopped a fight, and was agitated by the police presence. ""Every time you see me, you try to mess with me,"" he said to the officers, protesting prior treatment. ""This stops today."" Within minutes, police had placed Garner in a chokehold and wrestled him to the ground, where he struggled, gasped for air, and died. Bystanders would catch two other instances of police violence over the next week. In the first, an officer is seen stomping on the head of a man arrested for marijuana possession, and in the second, an officer is shown using a chokehold on a pregnant woman after she grilled food on the sidewalk outside of her home (which, apparently, is against the law in New York City). The reason for these stops is a policing approach called ""broken windows,"" first articulated by scholars James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling in a 1982 Atlantic Monthly essay and later adopted by the NYPD in 1993. Broken windows prioritizes cracking down on minor offenses on the theory that doing so can preempt serious crime. Or, to use the metaphor of the idea, actual broken windows create the appearance of disorder, which creates actual disorder as criminals take advantage of the inviting environment. Rather than wait for the serious crimes to begin, police should ""repair the windows""--focus on petty crime like loitering, and you'll stop the worse crime from taking hold. It's an elegant concept, but there's little evidence it works. ""Taken together,"" notes a 2006 study from the University of Chicago, ""the evidence from New York City and from the five-city social experiment provides no support for a simple first-order disorder-crime relationship as hypothesized by Wilson and Kelling nor for the proposition that broken windows policing is the optimal use of scarce law enforcement resources."" Yes, the massive New York crime decline of the 1990s coincided with broken windows policing, but chances are it had more to do with a reversion to the mean (""what goes up, must come down, and what goes up the most, tends to come down the most"") than any new approach. If broken windows were just a waste of resources, it wouldn't be a huge concern. But as a policy, broken windows has also had the effect of terrorizing black and Latino New Yorkers. Perceptions of urban ""disorder"" are tied tightly to race and have been for more than a century (as detailed in sociologist Khalil Gibran Muhammad's The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime, and the Making of Modern Urban America). As we've seen on a regular basis--from Jonathan Ferrell to Renisha McBride--people of color, and blacks in particular, are feared as criminal in ways their white counterparts aren't. For instance, in one test of people's unconscious associations, researchers found that black males elicited the most negative reactions from white subjects. Likewise, in a 2009 survey on the question of blacks and violence, more than 30 percent of white respondents said that blacks were more violent than whites, and more than 40 percent said that ""many"" or ""almost all"" black men were violent, compared to less than 20 percent who said the same of black women or white men, and less than 10 percent who said the same of white women. Additionally, a study published this year found that--when comparing hypothetical felony acts by white, black, and Latino boys--police overestimated the age of black boys by nearly five years. In their eyes, a 13-year-old was an adult. Under ""broken windows,"" these biases take center stage. They inform police conduct and lead to situations where blacks and Latinos face the brunt of aggressive policing. Odds are good that a group of black kids hanging out on a stoop will look more suspicious to police, regardless of their behavior. A recent analysis bears this out. According to the New York Daily News, which combed through recent police data from the city, blacks and Latinos account for the vast majority (81 percent) of the 7.3 million police summonses issued under broken windows since 2001. These citations are minor--""consumption of alcohol on streets"" and ""bicycle on sidewalk""--but they produce frequent (and potentially dangerous) police encounters. For millions of black and Latino New Yorkers, the city is a literal police state, where officers patrol for papers and detain individuals on the slightest suspicion of illegal conduct. Which brings us back to the role of black crime in mass incarceration. What the New York experience suggests--and what a wide array of research tells us--is that crime data is fundamentally incomplete. Accounts of who did what (who committed more murders, who committed more thefts) say nothing about the level of policing in a given community. Yes, blacks are arrested for more thefts than any other group, but that doesn't tell us if African Americans committed more thefts. It's possible blacks are just more likely to be arrested, and that if you subjected whiter zip codes (say, poor rural areas) to similar levels of policing, you'd have similar results. And while there are outliers--high murder rates in Chicago--those have more to do with the unique environment of the areas (high poverty, hyper-segregated neighborhoods, for instance) than the blackness of the residents. To say otherwise is to ignore the extent to which our assumptions of black criminality are embedded in the data we choose to collect and the strategies we choose to pursue. This dynamic holds for other dimensions of crime. There are huge racial gaps in prosecutions and convictions. Compared to white males with comparable offenses, black and Latino males receive harsher sentences, serve greater prison time, and are more likely to be convicted. Crime for crime, you have a higher chance of going to prison (and for a longer time) as a brown-skinned offender than as a white one. In other words, even if you ignore the problems on the policing side of law enforcement, you still have to contend with the disparate impact of a criminal justice system that funnels blacks and Latinos into prison out of proportion to their numbers among criminals. In its write up of the broken windows data, the Daily News quotes one resident who gives a vivid picture of his daily surroundings:"	For Millions of Black and Latino New Yorkers, the City Is a Police State

According to an internal investigation, the agency had peered into the Senate Intelligence Committee's computer network. Yes, it was sorry, and yes, it would form an accountability board led by former Sen. Evan Bayh, though it was unclear how that move would restore anybody's confidence in government. CIA Director John Brennan had lied when he'd called the hacking ""beyond the--you know, the scope of reason in terms of what we would do."" Meanwhile, privacy advocates were considering whether a National Security Agency reform bill--the biggest potential victory for that loose coalition of watchdogs in years--relied on too much faith in the government's good nature. More than a year had passed since NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden's first leaks, and since a near-miss House amendment nearly nixed funding for bulk metadata collection. Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, who chairs the Judiciary Committee and who was elected in the backlash to Watergate, had debuted his version of the USA Freedom Act, and privacy groups had gotten behind it. But were they starting to be taken for granted? A day before the bill was released, privacy groups were given an advance, embargoed look at what it would contain. Many of them signed on to a letter in support of Leahy's bill. They'd asked for the House's USA Freedom Act to be improved, and they claimed it had been. The New York Times was on board, too. Yet at least one group debated whether to remove itself from the letter, and others (who avoided signing it) are debating whether they should try to sink the bill. ""We're concerned about some of the vague language in the bill,"" said Erik Martin, general manager of Reddit, ""and aren't supporting at the moment."" The dissenters saw problems that defied the talking points. The main thrust of the legislation, obviously, was that Leahy would prohibit the bulk metadata collection justified under Section 215 of the Patriot Act. Not bad, but there were, theoretically, other ways to get data--Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act (which made the PRISM program possible) and Executive Order 12333 (which allows the collection of data for non-U.S. persons). National security journalist Marcy Wheeler, who had called the House's bill ""USA Freedumber,"" read the bill and spotted the ways that it ""would permit the contact chaining on phone books and calendars, both things we know NSA obtains overseas, both things NSA might have access to through their newly immunized telecom partners."" At best, the bill was not a step back, and avoided codifying some of the NSA's bad practices. (That was a problem everyone had with the House's bill.) ""The bill does contain transparency provisions for 702, and it helps lay the groundwork for future reforms,"" said a Leahy spokeswoman, ""but it does not comprehensively address all the concerns for 702."" No one pretended otherwise. ""We weren't expecting, at this point, comprehensive 702 reform,"" said Amie Stepanovich, senior policy counsel at the pro-USA Freedom group Access. ""It's better addressed as part of a comprehensive package aimed at 702, something that we can argue separately. There's some reform now--the call detail program is shut down."" What prevents the government from finding a new loophole? Nothing, which is why some privacy groups feel like Sisyphus' rock keeps rolling down the hill. The privacy groups, encouraged that the Senate's bill was less horrid than the House's, encouraged it to be passed without more changes. That was at odds with the advice of Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden and Colorado Sen. Mark Udall, who wanted another bite at Section 702. ""Congress clearly intended this authority to be used to collect the communications of foreigners--not Americans,"" they said, ""yet the Director of National Intelligence recently confirmed that the NSA, CIA, and FBI conduct warrantless searches of communications of Americans that are swept up under this authority."" According to Elizabeth Goitein, whose Brennan Center for Justice had signed the pro-Leahy letter, there just weren't many good options for reformers. ""Defining bulk collection is no simple task,"" she said. I feel that this bill does the best possible job that could have been done under the circumstances. It should work to prohibit the bulk collection--what people understand to be bulk collection. But the bill doesn't pretend to address communications intel, which can either be captured under Section 702 or 12333. That absolutely needs to be addressed."" When can that happen? Maybe in 2016, when the Patriot Act comes up again. Maybe if there's another window opened by a fresh outrage. It took long enough to get this bill--would killing it really produce a better one? On Thursday, on the way out of a House Republican meeting, USA Freedom's House sponsor Rep. James Sensenbrenner acknowledged that the bill disappointed some reformers. ""It closes the door more, but not completely,"" said Sensenbrenner. ""There's a little bit of dissension, but I think a lot of the dissenters are trying to make the perfect the enemy of the good. Look, I worked on this. I got the House to pass it in the form it did. It was a choice of either doing that or not having a vote at all."""

Pleas and threats--voiced in backroom meetings and countless phone calls with the Russian president--failed to move Putin to publicly disown the pro-Russian rebels. Even the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine didn't sway the Kremlin leader. The sanctions announced by the U.S. and European Union on Tuesday are an admission that the diplomatic toolkit is officially empty. The West has miscalculated Putin's machinations ever since his Ukrainian proxy, then-President Viktor Yanukovych, fled to Russia in February after three months of pro-EU protests ended in a massacre on Kiev's Maidan square. To most Western Europeans at the time, Ukraine was an annoyingly large, poor country whose aspirations for EU membership caused more headaches than jubilation. But to Putin, Ukraine signified a strategically vital buffer zone whose sovereignty came only second to Russia's national security. He was playing the highest stakes from the very start. When pro-Western politicians formed a provisional government in the power vacuum that Yanukovych left behind, Putin was convinced that a U.S.-funded regime change had returned to Russia's doorstep. Without hesitation he annexed Crimea--home to the Russian Black Sea Fleet--to forestall any future NATO expansion. Then Putin encouraged pro-Russian protests in eastern Ukraine in an effort to throw the new Kiev authorities farther off balance. Putin understood the struggle for Ukraine to be about Russia's--and his own--survival. He connected the dots from Kiev's pro-Western Orange Revolution in 2004 to the anti-government protests that swept Moscow seven years later. This time Putin would take no chances: Allowing Ukraine to choose a Western course would be tantamount to letting the enemy in through the gates. In the former KGB agent's world, where little happens due to chance or coincidence, one cynical conspiracy had to be met with another. To Putin's surprise, the attempt to start a pro-Russian, ""anti-Maidan"" uprising in predominantly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine failed miserably. While local people may have been skeptical of closer association with the EU and the new Kiev government, they also didn't rally en masse around the Russian flag and incoherent calls for ""federalization."" That's why small, well-armed groups began seizing government buildings at strategic locations around the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in April to force the cause of independence from the ""fascist Kiev junta."" Supporters believed a slapdash ""yes"" referendum would guarantee them a fate like Crimea's. Instead, the clumsy, unprepared Ukrainian military arrived to put down the rebellion. Earlier rounds of Western sanctions may have made Putin think twice about sending regular troops into Ukraine, but nothing was stopping men and materiel from crossing the porous border from Russia. What started as a bunch of bored teenagers and frustrated middle-aged men playing soldier has since turned into a localized but very real war that has cost more than 1,100 lives, according to the United Nations. On a visit to Donetsk last week, I was struck by the change in mood compared with previous months. The city of 1 million has become a ghost town as the Ukrainian military closes in on the rebel stronghold. While locals used to openly express support for the separatists, I heard no praise for the rebels this time. One older woman whose neighborhood had been shelled told me she was disappointed that Petro Poroshenko, elected Ukraine's president in May, reneged on his promise to make his first trip to Donetsk. A shopkeeper confided in me that she and all her acquaintances were impatiently awaiting the Ukrainian Army. A taxi driver railed that the anarchy was a bonanza for criminal gangs. It wouldn't be correct to call the current fighting a civil war because of the ambiguous, outsize role Russia has played. The Donetsk rebels' commander, Igor Girkin, and their political leader, Alexander Borodai, are both from Moscow. Contrary to Kremlin propaganda, there is no conflict between Ukrainian- and Russian-speakers. Large swaths of Ukraine, including Kiev, speak Russian as a first language. In many ways, the conflict could be characterized as Ukraine's war of independence, since the fighting has galvanized a sense of nation among Ukrainians regardless of where they live. Even if they didn't support the pro-EU protesters during the winter demonstrations on the Maidan, most Ukrainians now view Russia as an antagonistic neighbor that can't be trusted. It's become impossible for Ukrainians to feel ambivalent about their national identity. Just because Putin hasn't succeeded in instigating a larger pro-Russian uprising doesn't mean that a quick resolution is in sight. Ukrainian politicians from all camps have proved themselves to be singularly shortsighted and self-interested. Last week, with the battle for the East still far from won, the government coalition collapsed and Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk resigned. When cold weather returns in the fall and the Ukrainian government discovers it doesn't have enough money to pay Russian natural-gas giant Gazprom, the energy crunch will start to bite. And without a decisive victory on the battlefield, frustrations both within the military and on the homefront could boil over. It's far from clear whether Ukraine can win its war for independence. Putin has already shown that he is prepared to let Ukraine go up in flames--even if the consequences for Russia are unforeseeable. The danger is that the violent, nationalist elements in Russia unleashed by the war will demand greater Russian involvement, especially if the rebels lose more ground. Should Ukrainian forces manage to stamp out the rebellion, the chauvinist ghosts that Putin invoked to annex Crimea could come back to haunt him. The Girkins and Borodais of the world cheer Putin only as long as they see him restoring lost Russian glory, but their allegiance to the Kremlin is not unconditional. The blowback from Ukraine could make sanctions look like a joke."	Putin Has Unleashed Forces in Ukraine That Even He Can't Control

""If Hispanic Americans hear that the GOP doesn't want them in the United States, they won't pay attention to our next sentence ... they will close their ears to our policies,"" wrote the Republican National Committee in its Growth and Opportunity Project report. ""[O]ur Party's position on immigration has become a litmus test,"" it continued, ""measuring whether we are meeting them with a welcome mat or a closed door."" Republicans had to solve the immigration problem in order to move forward. And for a few months, it looked possible. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio spearheaded a comprehensive immigration bill, lobbying conservative activists and successfully moving it out of the Senate. Almost immediately, however, the party's right-wing base reasserted itself. House Republicans railed against the measure, rejecting the path to citizenship and demanding more funding for security at the border. Negotiation turned to intransigence, and last fall, fierce conservative anger led a desperate Rubio to abandon the bill and come out against comprehensive reform. By the end of the year, reform was nearly dead, with tough, if any, odds for progress. In other words, Republicans knew what they had to do to make an appeal to Latino voters. But rather than follow their own prescription and embrace a new approach, they splurged on their old habits, binging on anti-immigrant rhetoric and indulging their worst nativist instincts. Indeed, the past few months have seen Republicans come unhinged at the mass arrival of child migrants and refugees from central America, with warnings of disease and mayhem. But politicians are nothing if not optimistic, and the GOP is giving Latino outreach another shot. The new plan is to ignore immigration and try to bridge the gap with economic issues. In an NPR interview last week, Rubio told host Steve Inskeep, ""The vast majority of a significant portion of Americans of Hispanic descent [who] will vote happen to be working-class people who are desperate to not only achieve the American dream but leave their kids better off than themselves. And they are going to vote for the political movement and the candidates who they believe understand what they're facing and have real ideas to help them.""

22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/07/heat_and_eat_republicans_keep_trying_to_close_a_snap_loophole_that_doesn.html	"In February, following a bitter fight that lasted four years, Congress passed a nearly $1 trillion farm bill that was designed to eliminate more than $8.6 billion from the federal food stamp program over the next decade. Republicans eager to spend less to feed the poor saw it as a win because it did just that. Democrats hailed it as a victory because it was only a fraction of the $40 billion in food stamp cuts Republicans had wanted. The bipartisan group of lawmakers who brokered the deal promised that those savings would come from closing what they branded a ""loophole""--namely, a provision that allowed cold-weather states to pay out a nominal amount in heating assistance to needy residents in order to boost the total amount of food stamps they received from the federal government. But in the five months since, something has happened that neither the lawmakers who wrote the law nor the anti-poverty crusaders who fought them anticipated: At least seven of the 15 states in question are taking steps to ensure the ""heat and eat"" cuts don't happen, and the remaining eight have suggested they may do the same, according to a recent tally by Pew's Stateline. House Republicans have responded by promising to take action. ""Since the passage of the farm bill, states have found ways to cheat, once again, on signing up people for food stamps,"" House Speaker John Boehner told reporters in March. ""And so I would hope that the House would act to try to stop this cheating and fraud from continuing."" Rep. Paul Ryan, the chairman of the Budget Committee, has proposed ending the practice all together by eliminating the entire provision in the next budget. On Thursday, Rep. Steve King, the Iowa Republican who chairs the Agriculture Committee's oversight panel, likewise decried what the states were doing as ""abuse"" and suggested his committee would address it as soon as possible. But public health experts and anti-poverty advocates warn that what's being lost in the GOP's latest push to rewrite the law--and what was largely missing from the original debate all together--is that this so-called loophole is anything but. ""By calling it that they're suggesting that someone's trying to get away with something--it's almost a criminal accusation,"" says Mariana Chilton, an associate professor at Drexel University's School of Public Health. ""That's the kind of language people use when they don't understand the hardship that these families are experiencing every day."" Instead of a loophole, Chilton and other experts say the ""heat and eat"" provision was designed to acknowledge that the current formulas that set food stamp benefits don't take into account true housing costs. The provision isn't a policy mistake, they say; it gives families more money for food, allowing them to spend more of their budget on heat. In its original form, ""heat and eat"" gave participating states the ability to boost the amount of food stamps a family received by giving a needy household as little as $1 a year in home-heating assistance. That heating subsidy, in turn, meant the family would qualify for an average of $90 in extra food stamps each month. It was designed to account for the fact that families in states with higher energy costs often find themselves in an untenable position during the winter as they are forced to decide whether to turn on the heat or keep food on the table. (Pediatricians spotted the danger years ago, dubbing the issue the ""heat or eat"" syndrome.) Families that chose to eat, the research suggests, will often attempt to heat their homes with their stoves, raising the risk of fire while still failing to keep their children warm, which increases the odds they'll eventually be hospitalized for upper respiratory infections and other preventable illnesses. Believing states wouldn't be willing to pony up extra cash to keep the families receiving the extra food stamps, lawmakers branded that $1 subsidy a gimmick and used the farm bill to raise the qualifying threshold to $20 a year. It turns out they were wrong--something anti-poverty advocates now say simply proves their original point that lawmakers were never dealing with a loophole in the first place. According to Greg Kauffman, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, the state officials boosting assistance to the families in need are closer to the ground than lawmakers in Washington, and have a much better idea of just how dire the situation is for food stamp recipients, who currently receive an average of $1.40 per meal.* ""So when the state administrators say, 'No, we can't take away something that was smart policy,' it kind of disproves that this was some sort of technocratic gimmick as some portrayed it to be,"" says Kauffman. States, of course, have a clear incentive to keep the ""heat and eat"" benefits coming. In Vermont, where more than 19,000 households receive the benefits, meeting the new threshold will cost the state an extra $400,000. That total, however, will mean $15 million more in food stamps for those families. It's the same story in New York, where the state plans to raise home-heat spending by $6 million in order to keep 300,000 households receiving the extra benefits. When you factor in the additional economic activity created by each food stamp dollar, that $6 million investment would mean a return of $786 million for the state's economy. Exactly what the GOP will do next remains to be seen. Senate Democrats had originally set the threshold at $10 in their own version of the bill before ultimately agreeing to raise it to the House-passed $20 figure.* One likely line of attack would be to raise that figure further in hopes of finding the point where states will be either unwilling or unable to pay to keep the federal aid coming. But if Democrats are willing to entertain such suggestions, critics warn, they'll be making the same mistake they did the first time around when they let conservatives begin tampering with the program. ""They fell right into their little trap by allowing Republicans to use the loophole language [and label it] fraud, waste, and abuse,"" says Chilton. ""It was just a political strategy to cut the program--and now they're stuck dealing with an imaginary football."" Correction, July 29, 2014: This article originally misstated that the version of the farm bill passed by the House called for the elimination of the ""heat and eat"" provision altogether. The bill set the qualifying threshold at $20. (Return.) It also misidentified the Center for American Progress as the Center of American Progress. (Return.)"	House Republicans Want to Cut Food Stamps by Closing a Loophole That Doesn't Exist
23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/07/republican_party_s_battle_of_ideas_the_gop_s_2016_presidential_candidates.html	"What if they held a presidential campaign and a think tank broke out? House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, who is considering running for president, offered his thoughts on poverty last week. Sen. Marco Rubio has been giving regular policy speeches on poverty, college loans, and helping the middle class. Former senator and GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum is promoting a book of policy proposals on education, family, and revitalizing American manufacturing. Sen. Rand Paul is offering ideas on criminal justice and will give a big foreign policy speech in the fall. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has given speeches on health care and education aimed at a national audience. His staff recently sent an email titled ""policy leader"" that linked to a Time piece about how he is preparing to be the candidate of ideas in 2016. Who isn't trying to be the ideas candidate in the 2016 campaign? Texas Gov. Rick Perry is working to overcome his 2012 debate aphasia, so he's trying to show some policy chops. Though former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush holds controversial ideas on Common Core education standards and immigration, those close to him say he won't run unless he can promote those ideas with gusto. It isn't usually this policy-thick in the GOP presidential field. In primaries, there is sometimes one conservative candidate who tries to position himself through the creativity of his proposals, but mostly candidates engage in displays of strength on questions of orthodoxy--how much they want to cut taxes, shrink regulation, and lock up the borders. Now the Republican candidates are not only seeking to distinguish themselves from each other with the quality and originality of their ideas, but they are making the case that unless the party promotes new ideas, it will not prevail. The class of candidates for 2016 has the potential to be the most robust in almost 40 years--perhaps in modern Republican history. It depends on who finally decides to run, of course, but six governors and four senators are thinking seriously about it. Popular but implausible candidates like Herman Cain and Michele Bachmann have not emerged. If you were an excitable type, you could really get your hopes up that the high caliber of the candidates might connect with the energetic issues debate taking place in the conservative movement and spur an actual public discussion and competition of ideas. The challenge for any conservative policy fans is how to promote ideas in Washington these days. Groundbreaking notions must get through the congressional permafrost of self-preservation, risk aversion, polarization, and limited attention. Even if Republicans take control of the Senate, GOP leaders are too weak to push unfamiliar ideas through an institution that can barely accomplish the basics of governing. The presidential competition offers the best venue for idea promotion. The contest will get a lot of media coverage and voter attention, and candidates have political incentives to focus on policy. Lesser candidates can get coverage and raise money by promoting original policy ideas. It's very helpful to show a donor skeptical about your 2016 chances a few clips or blog entries talking about how innovative and interesting your ideas are. (The downside is that this donor will then burden you for months with all of his fascinating and unworkable ideas). If you are a senator, talking about ideas helps elide the fact that you have no experience implementing them. For governors, speeches about national policy challenges make you look less parochial. The question is whether ideas can actually survive once the race is joined in earnest. The 2012 GOP primary was a purity test. At one debate, no candidate would consider a budget proposal whereby $10 in savings was traded for a dollar in tax increases. Mitt Romney kept a pillow over his Massachusetts health care reform, his signature achievement as governor, for fear of raising unfavorable comparisons to Obamacare. On immigration, the competition to show who was more conservative pushed Romney to promote ""self-deportation"" for undocumented workers. Newt Gingrich fancied himself the ideas candidate--and he had a few good ones--but when he strayed from the orthodox support for Ryan's Medicare plan--calling it ""right-wing social engineering""--he was hounded into silence. When he did emerge as a candidate at the top of the field, it wasn't because of his ideas on brain science, but because he was seen as a good fighter who could bloody President Obama. Herman Cain's 9-9-9 tax plan--the most memorable idea of 2012--forced the candidates to talk about their plans for taxes, but was largely a novelty. Those forces could take hold again; indeed, they likely will. Conservatives who participate in primaries want to know where candidates stand on the bread-and-butter issues. That means candidates are going to seek out differences with their opponents where they can achieve the most politically. Fancy theories are nice, but voters take their cues based on what they know. Paul can endure silence from his audience at the Iowa GOP convention in the spring of 2014 when he challenges them about the GOP's attitude toward convicted criminals, but in the fall of 2015 every incentive will be to keep the focus on the red meat. The debates will encourage the same. Networks will seek out conflict, which is likely to be on the familiar grounds of immigration, spending, taxes, and Obama is awful. That isn't a modern phenomenon. In a 1980 New Hampshire debate, Bob Dole was charming about the lack of discussion of the issues. All the incentives are for candidates to give speeches now, when the stakes are low. As a political matter, simply gaining the patina of being an ""ideas candidate"" might be enough to win over voters who like the idea of an ideas candidate but don't really want to wrestle with complex policy. When the primaries heat up, you can coast on your ""ideas"" while stumping in the traditional grooves. What might keep this policy competition from getting swamped by the usual political pressures is that the candidates promoting them think they are vital to the future of the party. Jindal thinks that by promoting policy answers to people's everyday problems, it will rescue the Republican Party from being, as he called it, the ""stupid party."" Santorum argues that only by promoting a set of issues that show a concern for the poor and an appeal to the middle class can the party survive. ""We can win every businessman's vote and still lose elections by landslides,"" he says. ""As far as a lot of workers in America are concerned, we don't care about them."" That all sounds promising in the summer of 2014, and without a principal villain like President Obama, there will be time to talk about other things in the next presidential race. But the challenge in talking about ideas during a campaign is the same with implementing them: Can they survive a confrontation with reality?"

""In the envisioned scenario providers would work with families to design a customized life plan to provide a structured roadmap out of poverty,"" Ryan writes. At a minimum, these life plans would include ""a contract outlining specific and measurable benchmarks for success,"" a ""timeline"" for meeting them, ""sanctions"" for breaking them, ""incentives for exceeding the terms of the contract,"" and ""time limits""--presumably independent of actual program limits--for ""remaining on cash assistance."" Even for conservatives--who champion welfare drug tests and robust work requirements--this is breathtakingly paternalistic. As Annie Lowrey notes for New York magazine, ""[I]t isolates the poor. Middle-class families don't need to justify and prostrate themselves for tax credits. Businesses aren't required to submit an 'action plan' to let the government know when they'll stop sucking the oxygen provided by federal grant programs."" What's more, as she also points out, it treats the poor as if they want to stay that way and all but punishes ""the poorest and most unstable families for their poverty and instability."" As with other measures that tie aid to ""accountability""--like family caps for welfare--a sanction can spark a downward spiral to deeper poverty. Still, this approach has defenders. Here at Slate, my colleague Reihan Salam defends the paternalism in Ryan's plan as a necessary response to the diversity of the poor and the idiosyncrasy of American poverty:"	The Poor Don't Need a Life Coach

I'm Slate's ""National Correspondent,"" even though nobody here calls me that. They think I'm a ""Senior Editor"" or something like that. I asked for the title ""National Correspondent"" 10 years ago because it's so nebulous that it lets me write about anything: politics, science, sex, hot dog eating contests, whatever. You'd think that ""National Correspondent"" would at least exclude writing about what was going on in other countries. But that's what I've been doing for the last month. First it was Iraq, then Gaza. So most of what I've been reading lately is news from the Middle East. Keeping up with the news over there, when you're stuck at a desk in Washington, is tricky. Most Arab newspapers and many Israeli ones aren't available in English. Among those that are, you have to be careful. My favorite is Arutz Sheva, Israel's Channel 7. People will tell you it's biased. Of course it is! It's Israel's Fox News. The Israeli press has been cheerleading for the Israel Defense Forces even harder than the U.S. media did for our ""war on terror"" after 9/11. But Arutz Sheva is in its own class. It runs articles that consist entirely of IDF propaganda. It has boilerplate polemical paragraphs (about Hamas' use of ""human shields,"" for example), which it sprays as liberally as rocket fire from Gaza. But you know what? I love Arutz Sheva. For news, it's totally on the ball. It feeds you all the IDF's bulletins and spin, and it keeps you informed about the Israeli right the same way Fox News keeps you posted on the Republican Congress. You just have to understand what you're reading: This is somebody's point of view. For other points of view, look elsewhere. Haaretz is a good place to read views from the Israeli left. For balanced coverage, you can try Ynetnews (Yedioth Ahronoth in English) or the Jerusalem Post. Before visiting the Post, I strongly advise disabling Flash in your browser. The Post's pages run more script than a Torah and take longer to open and read. For Arab perspectives, I look at Al Jazeera, Al Arabiya, and Al-Monitor. For reporting from Palestine, the Ma'an News Agency is far and away the best. Much of what's in the Arab media is armchair wankery. Ma'an is on the ground in Gaza with cold reporting of the dead and wounded. This is how I how I read the news. Skip the commentary, find the reporting.  Expect bias, recognize it, factor it into your reading, and look for other sources that round out the picture. Trust no one. Avoid echo chambers. Keep all your assumptions open to review. You'll never fully understand anything, but you'll always be learning. That's also how we run things at Slate. There's no party line here. I've compared Gaza with other wars, making the case that Israel's efforts to spare civilians are exemplary. But I've also criticized Israel's house demolition policy and its collective punishment of Palestinians. This week, Allison Benedikt wrote an impassioned essay that blames Birthright for the death of a young American who died fighting for the IDF in Gaza. And Fred Kaplan wrote a terrific critique of Israel's myopic approach to the war. That's the kind of breadth and free inquiry we pursue here, with your support. Thanks for being a Slate Plus member."

By 11 a.m. the best seats along the parade route are taken, and the free sidewalk space has been chalked up, courtesy of a nearby church, with suggested prayers and Bible verses. As the crowd sweats, the grand marshal reminds everyone to return in August for a Vietnam veteran motorcycle ride. ""They didn't really get the respect they deserved when they returned home,"" he says. ""Let's make it up to them."" A few blocks away, at the back of the parade route, the local congressman who has been called ""al-Qaida's best friend"" is getting plenty of respect. Rep. Justin Amash, whose libertarian voting record supposedly made him a soft target for more hawkish Republicans, is finding no one who agrees with his opponents' attacks. ""I don't know why they just don't deal with honest facts,"" says one elderly voter. ""It's backfiring on 'em,"" says Amash. A propane salesman named Don Rittersdorf asks why Amash's opponent, a businessman named Brian Ellis, is being so vicious. ""Right out of the gate, he was attackin'!"" he says. ""I was like, holy cow!"" ""It's just that time of year,"" says Amash. Josh Reisbig, who works for a trucking company, tells Amash that he did not fall for an ad accusing him of backing gender-selective abortion. ""You've got a bill with multiple things in there, and they focus on one part,"" says Amash, smiling while he shakes his head. Amash, joined by Lt. Gov. Brian Calley, walks away to find his campaign team. The 37-year-old Calley is wearing jeans and wingtips; the 34-year-old congressman is wearing shorts and sneakers. Ellis is nowhere to be seen, but the Amash fans can't stop talking about him. ""I like when he attacks [Amash] for the abortion crap,"" says Reisbig, ""just because he didn't want to spend some money. Now he's pro-abortion? He just wants to keep the government off your back, dude."" That is the reaction that $1.4 million in donations to Brian Ellis--and even more outside spending--was supposed to prevent. In October 2013 a scattered but insistent group of wealthy east Michiganders talked confidently about beating the libertarian. ""The business community in Grand Rapids has been completely disenchanted with Amash,"" a GOP operative (and Romney campaign veteran) told the Washington Post. Donors were ""ready to go,"" according to the proudly centrist former Ohio Rep. Steve LaTourette, who now heads the centrist Main Street Partnership. And hey, the business community was having a good year. Until this week, when businessman David Perdue defeated Rep. Jack Kingston in a primary for Georgia's open Senate seat, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was undefeated in the races it had entered. Even Perdue wasn't an inherently doomed candidate like 2012's Todd Akin or 2010's Christine O'Donnell. But Amash was supposed to be the jewel in the crown, and it doesn't look like he will be. For months the loose Republican ""establishment"" has been explaining away likely victory for a young libertarian who--in the short version of his sins--supported Ron Paul for president, opposed John Boehner for speaker, voted against Paul Ryan's budgets, and got dangerously close to defunding the NSA's metadata collection program. In a June poll, Amash led Ellis by 20 points, just as he did in May. The election is on Aug. 5. If the business community's top Republican target wins easily next month, here's how. Voters like it when you explain yourself. In the state legislature, then in Congress, Amash kept up a habit of explaining his votes on Facebook. No reporter had to ask him for a statement, no voter had to call his office. In 2012, for example, he explained his vote against a bill to ban gender-selective abortions with four paragraphs about the stuff Trojan-horsed into it. ""The bill also shockingly makes it a crime for a medical or mental health professional NOT to turn in someone who they SUSPECT of having committed this thought crime,"" Amash explained. The Facebook post came in handy when Ellis, endorsed by Michigan Right to Life, started whaling on Amash as an ally of the worst kind of abortionists. After Ellis put it in an ad (complete with photos of babies swaddled in blue and pink), fact-checkers cited the congressman and declared the ad false. In an interview, Amash pointed out that Michigan RTL ignored his whole record--""I'm proudly pro-life""--and endorsed Ellis on the basis of that one vote. Voters agree with libertarians about the NSA. Ellis' harshest attack ad isn't even the one that accuses Amash of fetal xenocide. It's the one that quotes California Rep. Devin Nunes, a fellow Republican who called Amash ""al-Qaida's best friend in Congress,"" and then puts a combat veteran in front of the camera to say the congressman ""even voted to shut down American intelligence from monitoring terrorists."" The ad is half-clueless, half-offensive. It was impossible (in a short time, anyway) to find voters in Ionia who disagreed with Amash's NSA bill, or at least the way they'd heard it described. And Amash has repeatedly called on Nunes to apologize for an insult ""unbecoming"" of a member of Congress. ""He's running a dishonest campaign,"" Amash says after the parade. It's why he's refused to debate Ellis, and why the two men have only interacted when Amash called in to a radio show to prove that Ellis was lying about his votes. ""As he's fallen further behind in the polls, his team has gotten more desperate,"" says Amash. ""So the attacks have gotten even wilder. It's 10 months and he hasn't done one positive ad."" Rich libertarians leave no man behind. In January the Club for Growth--which had supported Amash in 2010--started a $200,000 ad buy against Ellis. In February, David Koch's Americans for Prosperity went up with its own $230,000 ad buy, asking voters to ""thank Justin Amash"" for ""fighting Obamacare,"" copping footage from an Amash town hall. You can disagree with the ""libertarian"" tag, and whether it applies to Amash's endorsers, but the fact is that the groups that wanted Michigan's 3rd to be represented by a leadership/NSA foe called the bluff of the ""centrists."" It took until June for Amash's critical colleagues, like House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, to raise funds for Ellis. It took until July for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to endorse him, and for Rep. Pete Hoekstra--who represented a neighboring district, and who previously ran the intel committee--to endorse him. Amash dismisses Rogers and Hoekstra as ""retired or retiring members trying to take a shot on the way out,"" at odds with Republicans like Calley. The media can be your friend--especially if you vote libertarian. Amash has opened up his campaign to anyone who'll ask. In Ionia, when he sat for an interview, his press aide stayed out of sight. Being that open allows Amash to mock his opponent for putting up barriers to seeing him. ""He'll send a letter out that he'll be at someone's coffeehouse,"" says Amash. ""But he doesn't post his events on Twitter or Facebook because he doesn't want people walking in and asking questions."" Before heading to the district, I email Ellis' campaign to find out where the challenger would be, and whether he could talk. First, the campaign asks for a ""clearer picture"" of what the story might turn into. Then it suggests a phone interview, albeit after I expand on what I might write. The candidate never calls. Amash returns to D.C. for a last week of work before the recess, when he can campaign back home, and win an election that the Republican establishment promised he would lose."	The Man the Chamber of Commerce Can't Beat
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/07/republicans_attacking_democrats_for_their_wealth_and_business_experience.html	"The minute David Perdue won the Republican primary in Georgia, Democrats hit send on an email attacking his business career. At nearly 2,500 words, the blast arrived in my inbox from American Bridge, a liberal opposition research firm, outlining the jobs Perdue had cut and outsourced as a business executive. ""Georgia, Meet Mitt Romney Lite,"" was the headline. Voters say they want politicians with a business background. In a recent Gallup poll, 81 percent responded that the country would be better governed if more people with business and management experience were elected. Voters prioritized that attribute far above every other. But that finding may only be a sign of the chasm between campaigning and governing, because while voters may like the idea of electing executives who have experience making tough decisions, campaign strategists see an opportunity to use those same decisions to portray candidates as callous, out-of-touch, and ignorant of middle-class needs. In Georgia, Democrats are using the Romney boogeyman in an echo of the campaign the Obama team used to win the 2012 presidential election. That's hardly surprising. What is more surprising is that Republican campaigns across the country are adopting the same Obama tactics against Democrats. In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker has been attacking the business record of his opponent, former Trek bicycle executive, Mary Burke. The Walker campaign ran an ad claiming that Burke made millions by shipping jobs overseas to countries where the minimum wage was as low as $2 an hour. Walker says it's hypocritical since Burke is pushing for a minimum wage hike in Wisconsin. Another ad labels her an ""outsourcer"" and spells her name ""Mary $ Burke."" President Obama and his allies made similar claims about Romney. Walker claimed Trek paid no corporate income taxes, an echo of Sen. Harry Reid's unfounded smear about Romney. Burke's brother responded on behalf of the company in a full-page newspaper ad. He said he and not his sister, who ran the European division of the company, made decisions about where to locate jobs. Trek employs 1,000 workers in Wisconsin and 800 people outside the country, according to the company. Burke has tried to turn the attacks against Walker, saying that if he understood the way business works, he would understand that Wisconsin companies like Trek and Harley-Davidson need to manufacture around the world and that Trek pays taxes like many other businesses, where the owners pay taxes on the company's profits as individuals rather than through corporate taxes. A candidate's business record is totally fair game, but attacks on business activity can quickly melt into a general attack on wealth. That's certainly happening in Wisconsin. The state's GOP is calling Burke ""Millionaire Mary,"" says she is a member of the ""1 percent,"" and posted pictures of her second home on a website devoted to making an issue of her wealth. In Pennsylvania, Republicans have also stapled net worth to the Democratic candidate for governor, who they refer to as ""Millionaire Tom Wolf."" These attacks are not subtle. Using dollar signs, bags of money, and millionaire as a pejorative plays to gut level resentments about wealth. ""What's good for the goose is good for the gander,"" says a campaign strategist involved in GOP opposition research. But the question for Republicans who use these tactics is not whether they are fair--rather the issue is one of ideological consistency. These attacks buy into and seek to profit from the idea that there is something immediately suspicious about a person of wealth. Usually conservatives label those tactics as un-American, charging that such appeals are seeking to penalize success. If Republicans contribute to the claim that wealth is equated with not caring about the poor, then the GOP, as the party most associated with the wealthy, runs the risk of blowback. A CNN poll earlier this year asked which party favored the rich, and respondents answered by 69 percent to 30 percent that the Republicans did. Republicans already have a deficit with voters when it comes to questions about which party cares about the problems of regular people. In a CBS poll in May, Democrats outpolled Republicans by 10 points when asked which party cared about people like you and which party was more likely to help Americans get a fair chance to get ahead. That is why so many 2016 GOP presidential contenders are working to show that the Republican Party has a compassionate side. Republicans making an issue of wealth is not unlike Republicans criticizing Democrats for cutting taxes. That's why the Wall Street Journal called out Newt Gingrich and others during the 2012 GOP primary for attacking Romney's career with ""crude and damaging caricatures of modern business and capitalism."" Recently, Allysia Finley, also in the Wall Street Journal, rebuked Walker on the same terms. ""Economic populism is usually the province of Democrats who don't understand how free markets work or who cynically hope to exploit voters' insecurities. Mr. Walker is better than that."" Republicans used the anti-Romney playbook last year in the Virginia governor's race, trying to make Terry McAuliffe's business career an issue, but the attacks didn't work. Charges of this sort work best when they support an underlying story about the candidate or his policies. Mitt Romney contributed to the characterization that he was disconnected from those in the middle class and most in need, most notably with the videotaped comments about the 47 percent who weren't likely to vote for him. When he picked Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate, someone who had also taken a dim view of those who used government services, it strengthened the connection in voter minds between wealth and stinginess. The 2012 exit poll found 53 percent said Romney's policies generally favored the rich, 34 percent the middle class, and 2 percent the poor; for Obama, just 10 percent thought his policies favored the rich, 44 percent the middle class, and 31 percent the poor. Republican Party officials have been relentless in attacking Hillary Clinton for her wealth since she claimed that she and her husband were ""dead broke"" after they left the White House. (They weren't). Poorhillaryclinton.com launched this week. If this tactic gains traction, it might not be because it incites envy, but because it suggests she's trying to pretend to be something she's not, which goes to a longstanding weakness she has had on issues of honesty and trustworthiness. Romney's career at Bain Capital was an easier career to demagogue because venture capitalism is associated with Wall Street bankers--who are never popular (especially after a recession caused by risky financial instruments). Walker is taking a risk attacking a popular Wisconsin company, and his administration wasn't always concerned about Trek's outsourcing: They once touted the company, which Burke's father started in a barn, as a sterling example of the state's entrepreneurs and business success. Before David Perdue won the Georgia GOP Senate primary, Democratic strategists were hoping to run against his Republican rival, Jack Kingston, a veteran congressman. It would be easier to run against his Washington insider status, they thought. Now they'll have to run against Perdue as a fat cat. They've got a head start. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee put out a two-minute video attacking Perdue as an out of touch millionaire and crony capitalist who punished workers and walked away with millions. It simply quotes his GOP primary opponents."	Is It Wise for Republicans to Attack Democrats for Their Wealth and Business Experience?

29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/07/how_to_save_gaza_demilitarization_and_abbas.html	"After two weeks of protests and denunciations, it's time to acknowledge that outrage won't end the war in Gaza. The most plausible way to stop this cycle of violence is through internationally supervised demilitarization. Amid so much death and destruction that may seem utterly hopeless. But in fact, many of the tools we need are already in place. Here's an analysis of the problem and how to fix it. 1. Gazans have no government to protect them. Every day, more civilians die in Gaza. Israel, the country that's killing them, has agreed to cease-fire proposals. But Hamas, which controls Gaza (though many of its political leaders don't even live there), rejects these proposals and continues to fire rockets into Israel. You can argue that the rockets justify Israel's attacks or that they serve merely as a pretext. Either way, they get more Gazans killed. The only way to make sense of Hamas' behavior is to recognize that its goal is not to stop the killing but to exploit it. That explains why Hamas encouraged Gazans to stand atop targeted buildings and ordered them to stay in areas where Israel had issued pre-invasion evacuation warnings. It also explains why Hamas insists that Israel grant concessions in exchange for a cease-fire. Hamas thinks a cease-fire is a favor to Israel. Given the gross imbalance in casualties, that's a pretty clear statement that Hamas thinks Gazan deaths should bother Israel more than they bother Hamas. That is just the latest display of Hamas' warped priorities. Another illustration is its tunnels. It has diverted hundreds of thousands of tons of building materials from civilian projects to tunnel construction. The tunnels to Egypt, which are largely for commerce, are rudimentary. The tunnels to Israel, which are for military attacks, are elaborate. Hamas cares more about hurting Israelis than about helping Gazans. 2. The absence of a protector in Gaza has worsened Israel's behavior. Israel knows from experience that invading and occupying Gaza is bad for Israel. During the present conflict Israel has signaled its willingness to stop, first by unilaterally honoring Egypt's cease-fire proposal, then by postponing a ground invasion. But Hamas has pressed on, daring Israel to go further. Israel has unwisely accepted the dare. Its mission has expanded from bombing the rocket launchers to destroying the tunnels. Predictably, the number of tunnels has grown. The number found so far ranges from 23 to 45. One report, based on infrared satellite imagery, says there might be 60 or more. Now the fighting has spread to Hamas' suppliers--on Friday there was a mysterious strike in Sudan--and Israeli hawks are talking about recapturing the Gaza-Egypt border. There's always another mission you can add to make Gaza ""safer."" Worse, Israel has adopted Hamas' use of human shields as a blanket excuse for civilian deaths. It's true that Hamas has used civilians this way, putting its rockets in schools, mosques, and hospitals, for example. But Israel has twisted these case-by-case abuses into a categorical claim that every civilian death is Hamas' fault. This kind of thinking inherently corrupts an invading army. Now some Israeli government ministers are calling for sweeping measures against Gaza, such as cutting off its electricity. The line between fighting Hamas and fighting Gaza is blurring. 3. Israelis have lost faith in a military solution. Since withdrawing its troops from Gaza in 2005 (but maintaining control over Gaza's borders, coast, and airspace), Israel has fought three wars there. By now, almost no one in Israel, other than the far-right fringe, believes force will stamp out Hamas or teach it a lasting lesson. The missiles get restocked, the tunnels get rebuilt, and every dead Hamas fighter is replaced by at least one more. Israel's callous phrase for its periodic operations in Gaza--""mowing the grass""--is a confession that force doesn't work. Israelis expect that after this war, they'll be at it again within two years. Each time, the futility becomes clearer. Gaza is so densely populated that you can't bomb it without killing civilians, and you can't send in ground forces without getting bogged down in the kind of urban warfare that spells death for invading troops. More than two dozen Israeli soldiers have already died in this operation, and one is missing. If Hamas captures another Gilad Shalit, it could easily extract concessions that would make the invasion a net loss for Israel. 4. There's an obvious candidate to take over Gaza. Seven years ago, after winning a parliamentary election, Hamas seized military control of Gaza from Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority. But times have changed. The Hamas regime is bankrupt, and Abbas, who preaches nonviolence, is the one with access to international agencies and donors. That's why Hamas agreed in April to form a unity government controlled by Abbas. Here's where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a wrong turn. He halted peace talks with Abbas, denounced the merger, and did everything possible to sabotage it. That was stupid, because if anyone can coax Hamas toward a more rational style of government, it's Abbas. Israelis grouse about Abbas, but he has done a lot to merit their trust. His security forces in the West Bank have cooperated with Israel even when it angers Palestinians. Abbas would restore a government in Gaza that protects the people. He's already coaching Hamas on how to respond more intelligently to the Israeli bombardment. (First step: Accept a cease-fire.) He's meeting with officials from Egypt and other countries, who can help Gaza but have been spurned by Hamas. In effect, he's being treated internationally as Hamas' adult supervisor. And Hamas is beginning to listen. 5. The pieces of a solution are in place. Netanyahu and other Israeli politicians are converging on a proposal by Shaul Mofaz, Israel's former defense minister, to demilitarize Gaza in exchange for $50 billion in aid. That's nearly 30 times Gaza's GDP, but it's not a lot to ask from international donors, who might find it a better use of their money than paying for reconstruction after another Gaza war. (The damage from the last two weeks alone will cost $3 billion.) A credible international coalition would have to oversee the demilitarization. That's a useful mission to propose to the many countries that have expressed outrage over the carnage in Gaza: Put your soldiers and your money where your mouth is. (The European Union reaffirmed this commitment on Tuesday: ""All terrorist groups in Gaza must disarm."") Meanwhile, Hamas' chief arms supplier, Iran, would have to be pressured to back off. Fortunately, Iran has been trying to rebuild good will and is in the midst of productive talks with the United States, to which this issue could be added. Israel would resist yielding control of Gaza, but current conditions make Israeli flexibility more likely. The success of the Iron Dome anti-missile system has given Israelis confidence that if rockets start flying out of Gaza again, they can withstand the barrage without casualties for a while. The election of an Egyptian government hostile to Hamas strengthens Israel's trust that Gaza's Egyptian border won't become an easy channel for importing weapons. Israelis also complain that loosening restrictions in Gaza after a war with Hamas would reward violence. But Israel accepted that tradeoff 20 years ago, when it agreed to the principle of land for peace. Hamas, too, has essentially accepted this principle. Netanyahu claims that Hamas, like al-Qaida, ""has no resolvable grievance."" That's nonsense. Last week, Hamas issued a long list of demands, in exchange for which it offered Israel a 10-year truce. Many of these demands, such as an airport and the free flow of commerce across borders and the sea, are perfectly negotiable. Ten years is a long time. If Gaza could go 10 years without another war, and build an economy that looks more like the West Bank, we might not need another deal to keep the peace in place."	How to Save Gaza
