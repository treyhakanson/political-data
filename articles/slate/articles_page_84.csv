The Supreme Court's decision to let the core elements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act stand kicks the fate of the Obama administration's signature initiative where it properly belongs--into the domain of politics--where a Romney administration would still have ample opportunity to dismantle the main elements of the law. One thing President Romney probably couldn't do, however, would be the politically expedient step of simply repealing the legally controversial and politically unpopular fine levied on people who decline to purchase health insurance. Both Romney (who embraced a mandate as governor of Massachusetts) and Obama (who opportunistically opposed a mandate when running against Hillary Clinton) understand the basic issue here. Requiring insurance companies to accept all customers and charge the same price regardless of their state of health (""guaranteed issue"" and ""community rating"" in wonk-speak) are popular but unworkable ideas. If people can buy insurance only after they get sick, then there isn't enough money coming into the system to cover the bills of the people who are sick. That's why even the Obama administration told the Supreme Court that if they struck down the mandate, the guaranteed issue and community rating provisions should go as well. The court did have the option of being devious, and simply kicking the dilemma of what to do with a mandateless market back to the White House. But a future Romney administration would have to internalize the consequences of stripping the mandate and thus would be unlikely to try to isolate it. This is where Democrats may come to rue the day that they decided to delay implementation of the main parts of their signature initiative all the way until 2014. The upside of delaying implementation was that it superficially made the cost of the bill inside the 10-year scoring window used by the Congressional Budget Office look smaller than it otherwise would. The downside is that they made it much simpler for Republicans to take some unpopular actions in 2013 than might have been the case. Once the insurance exchanges created by the law are in place, repealing the guaranteed issue and community rating provisions would mean throwing millions of sick people off their insurance plans. That would create a large and concentrated constituency of people who'd be informed by their doctors and their insurers about possible legislative changes. And it turns out that the provisions a Romney administration would need to repeal to gut the law are wildly popular. According to a Reuters poll earlier this week, 78 percent of self-identified Republicans favor ""banning insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions"" and 86 percent of them support ""banning insurance companies from canceling policies because a person becomes ill."" In other words, once the basic framework of the law is in place, it'll be all but impossible to kill. That's probably why no country that's instituted a universal health insurance program has ever rolled it back--even strong conservatives like Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom or the current right-wing government in Canada leave existing programs in place. The problem for Democrats is that if Romney takes office in 2013, none of this stuff will have actually happened yet. Repealing the law in its abstract form is a bit politically risky for Republicans but not nearly as risky as it will become in the future. Already in 2011, House Republicans were thrilled to vote for a ""Repeal the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act,"" even though it was obvious that the president was never going to sign it. If in January 2013 Republicans control all three branches of government, there's no reason to think they'll grow more timid. In a statement immediately following the Supreme Court's decision, Romney promised to ""act to repeal Obamacare"" on his ""first day if elected president of the United States"" and if Congress puts a bill to that effect on his desk, he'll do it. Still, though Republicans seem likely to win control of the Senate in any scenario where Romney becomes president, it's exceedingly unlikely that they'd score the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. Technically speaking, since repealing the bill would increase the budget deficit, it should be ineligible for the budget reconciliation process that Democrats used to pass the bill in the first place with only 59 votes. In reality, this is unlikely to make a difference to a determined GOP. Back in 2001 and 2003, Republicans were able to find gimmicks to pass giant tax cuts under reconciliation orders, and in this case conservatives sincerely believe that the CBO is mistaken and repeal would reduce the deficit. Scrapping the law, in other words, should be a pretty easy lift for Republicans--if they win the election. But if they lose, as provisions of the law roll out during Obama's second term, they're likely to find that it's very difficult to take popular benefits away from people who already have them. By declining to do Republican politicians' work for them, in other words, John Roberts just made 2012 a very consequential election."	Romney's Promised To Scrap ObamaCare--and If He Wins He Can Do it
1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/06/the_slate_surveymonkey_political_survey_does_mitt_romney_s_business_experience_matter_to_american_voters_.html	"The Slate/SurveyMonkey political survey returns with this month's snapshot of the opinions of more than 1,000 registered voters across the country. (Information on respondents is available here. More information about SurveyMonkey Audience is here.) Our last installment revealed that, while Obama trounced Romney in likeability, his personal charm didn't necessarily translate into high marks for governing. This time, we wanted to get a sense of whether feelings about the POTUS had changed--do we still trust him to baby-sit our kids--and also to examine the reception of one of Romney's big talking points: that his business experience will make him a successful president. We started off by asking, again, ""If your car was broken down on the side of the road, which presidential candidate would you want to stop and help you change the tire?"" Obama is still considered more likeable than Romney. In fact, the likeability gulf between Obama and Romney widened even a little more this month: More than 47  percent of respondents (up from 45 percent) would rather see the current president approaching in his Ford, while only 21 percent (down from 23.9 percent) would prefer a Romney motorcade. And the same trend was true when we again asked which candidate people would choose to hire as a baby-sitter. More than 48 percent of those surveyed opted for Obama, compared to May's 46 percent, and 21.1 percent picked Romney, a dip of 0.7 percent from last month. Of course, Miss Congeniality doesn't always win the beauty pageant: A top-notch personality can only take you so far. We wondered if respondents thought Romney would have done any better with the reins of power than Obama did in 2009. Opinion was divided: More than 23 percent believed the governor would have performed ""about the same,"" compared to the 22.8 percent that felt he would have handled the position ""much worse."" Just over 21 percent speculated that Romney might have acquitted himself ""somewhat better"" than Obama as president--but, on the other hand, 17.3 percent imagined he would have done ""somewhat worse."" And 15.5 percent, the smallest group, envisioned Romney steering the ship of state ""much better"" than the incumbent in 2009. In other words, no consensus was reached. Still, Obama's charisma is clearly a campaign asset, especially if POTUS succeeds in framing 2012's contest as a face-off between him and Romney, rather than a referendum on the economy. We wondered whether the former governor's business expertise--a selling point he hammers away at on the campaign trail--offers him any advantage. ""In your opinion, would electing leaders with business experience be helpful in fixing our country's current economic problems or not?"" we asked. A sizeable 30.7 percent of survey takers thought that business acumen would prove ""somewhat helpful"" to a U.S. president trying to revive the economy. And 38.4 percent said they considered such a background ""very"" or ""extremely"" beneficial. Only 15.3 percent of respondents were skeptical that business smarts spelled presidential aptitude, at least in the abstract. When the question specifically mentioned Romney, though, the numbers became slightly less favorable. (Still, the erstwhile Bain boss should take heart: His record is likely to give him at least a small boost). We asked, ""Will Mitt Romney's business experience make him a better president, a worse president, or neither a better nor a worse president?"" Fewer than 20 percent of respondents found Romney a poorer choice for his time in the private sector. And while the largest plurality, 36.4 percent, held that his past at Bain would not affect his governing ability, a combined 43.8 percent of those surveyed viewed Romney's corporate record as a positive. The upshot? The former governor can make electoral inroads by mining his business history, just as Obama can count on his personal magnetism to rake in ballots. But who would the survey takers vote for if the election were held today? When we posed that query, the POTUS gathered 45.1 percent of respondents' votes, compared to 35.5 percent for Romney. Obama drifted upward from 44.7 percent last month, while his opponent slipped slightly, from 38.3 percent. But preference for one candidate doesn't necessarily spell high hopes. Curious about how many people believed that the election results would affect their day-to-day existence, we asked: ""In general, do you think your life will get better, get worse, or stay the same if Barack Obama is re-elected?"" And then we flipped the question to probe attitudes about a Romney White House: What did survey takers think would happen to them if Mitt took the helm? The results suggested voters aren't overly optimistic, no matter who wins. When it came to the possibility of four more years of Obama, the most sizable group, 28.7 percent, expected nothing much to change. A cautious 25.6 percent supposed life would get ""somewhat better"" (only 7.8 percent anticipated things turning ""a great deal better""), and a combined 37.9 percent thought life would get worse. Meanwhile, 26.1 percent of survey takers contended that a Romney presidency would shift things in a ""somewhat better"" direction, trailed closely by the 24 percent that suspected life would proceed as usual. Just over 42 percent overall gloomed that they would suffer either ""somewhat"" or ""a great deal"" with Romney in office. Only 7.9 percent thought their lives would improve significantly with the former governor. So even as they cast hypothetical ballots for Obama or Romney, survey takers seem to be withholding their vote of confidence in the American political system."

Since Scott Walker's victory in Wisconsin, a growing number of Republicans have been calling for something more from him. His recent responses on questions from tax reform to immigration have been thin or nonexistent. When reporters tried to get an answer about the candidate's reaction to the Supreme Court's ruling on Arizona's immigration law, his spokesperson was so evasive, my colleagues might want to plant a mulberry bush in the press section to make the next round of the game more lively. Usually you have to win the White House before you can be that skilled at ducking and weaving. But wait. A Romney campaign aide told Politico's Jonathan Martin, when he wrote about this topic, that they have offered an ""unprecedented"" level of specificity. How can these two things both be true? To understand the disconnect, think of an ad for a prescription drug in a magazine. On one page there is an uplifting, well-lit picture of a healthy woman walking through a sunlit glen on the way to success. On the following two pages is all the fine print and possible side effects. Romney is specific about the glen and the breeze--tax cuts; more jobs for everyone; innovation; no more waste, fraud, and abuse--but is not so specific about the two pages of complexity and possible consequence. Is Romney offering an ""unprecedented"" level of specificity? This is an exciting claim, but it is contradicted by history. Next to me is my worn copy of Renewing America's Purpose, the 450-page volume of George W. Bush's policy addresses and proposals from 1999-2000. By this time in the 2000 campaign, Bush had unveiled a lot more policy than Romney has, including a plan to offer workers the ability to invest some of their Social Security money in private accounts. ""Mr. Bush is dominating the policy debate,"" the Economist wrote 12 years ago this month. ""[He] has seized on the opportunities to appear both bipartisan and statesmanlike."" It's also hard for the Romney campaign to boast about specificity when the candidate is doing the opposite. He's talked about why he won't give details because specificity was used against him in his Senate race and how his programs can't be evaluated by any experts because he hasn't provided details. How then can the Romney campaign claim to be so specific? The same way politicians like to believe that a response is the same as an answer. In background material offered by the campaign to show where Romney has been specific, many of the items were not so much Romney proposals but criticisms of President Obama. (This is also true of Romney's 160-page briefing book [pdf] titled Believe in America, which should have the subtitle Because Obama Doesn't.) A host of statements were generalities--a quotation from Nassim Nicholas Taleb's The Black Swan outlining mistakes that caused Wall Street's collapse, and calls for ""dynamic regulations."" In the section on financial system reform, Romney's adviser Glenn Hubbard is quoted from a Wall Street Journal article, saying that Romney would replace ""the new system for dismantling failing financial companies that was created as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law with a new system, which [Hubbard] declined to specify."" The Romney campaign is specific about some things. Romney will enact a 5-percent cut of nonsecurity spending on Day One of his presidency. He'll privatize Amtrak and reduce subsidies for NEA and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting--all of which is very specific but not highly consequential policy. He will repeal the Affordable Care Act, which is very specific. But he refuses to get specific about what will replace it. He's more specific about Medicare--seniors would be provided with a specified amount of money to purchase benefits, and private plans could compete--but details about how benefits would keep up with health costs are vague. When CBS's Bob Schieffer asked Tim Pawlenty, who launched his presidential campaign on the idea of telling hard truths, where Romney was being specific, the former Minnesota governor mentioned tax reform. Naming an issue area is not being specific. Adviser Eric Fehrnstrom offered Romney's plan for reducing the corporate tax rate as an example of specificity. Saying you're going to reduce corporate tax rates is the easy part; naming the loopholes to do so is harder. The word ""loopholes"" appears only twice in the 160-page Romney policy document: ""Meanwhile, loopholes favor those with the best lobbyists. If we close loopholes and lower the tax rate, the American people and corporations will win."" (#winning). When Gov. Romney was asked just what loopholes he would close to lower corporate and individual taxes, he said he'll work with Congress on that when he's elected. One of the funniest things Nancy Pelosi ever said was that Congress had to pass the Affordable Care Act to know what was in it. Romney makes a variant of that claim here: To know what he will do, we must elect him. The Romney campaign responds that the president has not been specific, either. This is true. The best example was Obama's refusal to back the specifics of the Simpson-Bowles commission. (It was a commission he commissioned which makes this a sin of commission.) But just because President Obama's posture is slouchy doesn't erase the fact that Romney is in the fetal position. Implicit in the Romney campaign's criticism of President Obama's specificity is a standard of how detailed one should be. But the Romney campaign would not like that standard to be applied to its candidate. Obama may not achieve the Platonic ideal of specificity, but he's well ahead of Mitt Romney. On loopholes, for example, President Obama has proposed a host he would remove (found on pages 202-05 of this Treasury Department explanation of the administration's revenue proposals). The largest one (explained on pages 73-74) would close loopholes (""tax expenditures"") for the wealthy by reducing (but not eliminating) the value of itemized deductions. Obama's framework for reducing corporate tax rates can be found here. Presidents are always more specific than their challengers because they have to actually put things on paper. In fact, it is President Obama's specificity that Mitt Romney is actually running against, in the form of the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform, the Recovery Act, and the auto bail-out. Obama can't both lack a plan for dealing with Medicare costs and be attacked for hatching the Independent Payment Advisory Board that is supposed to hold down Medicare costs. There's more than enough in all of that for voters to evaluate the president's priorities, his manner, and his effectiveness on those policies. For a challenger without a recent governing past or a rich history, specificity is one way to evaluate him as a possible president. So is Mitt Romney trying to get away with something? At the moment, yes, but there's plenty of time left in the campaign for him to get specific. Imagine if Gov. Romney picked Paul Ryan as his running mate. He'd go from policy avoidance to basing his entire campaign on one of the most detailed campaign documents ever: the Ryan budget. The political debate would be filled with plumes of charts and graphs. The big important debate we should be having about the role of government in American life would finally start. The speeches would probably get no shorter and the policy books would not shrink, but we might actually find something useful in them. "	Why Mitt Romney Won't Get Specific--About Anything

You can rescue yourself from a risk. If a gamble goes wrong, the consequences are irrevocable. I first learned this distinction from a battalion commander who had served several tours in Afghanistan. I interviewed him for a series of articles I wrote about risk. The lesson is now playing out in the pitched battle over the firing of Teresa Sullivan, the University of Virginia's president, whose pursuers completely ignored this distinction even though they imagined themselves to be brave risk-takers. The central risk taker in the story is Helen Dragas, the rector of the university who orchestrated the plot to unseat Sullivan. Days before she pushed Sullivan out, she emailed her co-conspirator Mark Kington a transcript of a commencement address delivered at Williams College by the New Yorker's Atul Gawande on risk, failure, and recovering from failure. His thesis is that while commencement speakers talk about risk, they never offer the key to risk-taking, which is knowing how to rescue yourself when your risk goes wrong. That is a key insight and a gift to the students. People are always going on about how we need to take risks, but they never explain how exactly one goes about it. Gawande was unwinding the mystery a little and giving the students something extremely useful. We don't know exactly why Dragas, a successful Virginia Beach real estate developer, sent a transcript of that speech. She just wrote to Kington, the vice-rector and a successful businessman in his own right, that it was ""timely.""  She very likely was using its argument to validate her push for a post-Sullivan public relations plan that she had put in place. In a collection of emails--obtained in a Freedom of Information Act request by the student newspaper, the Cavalier Daily-- Dragas and Kington discuss using an outside firm to address the blowback. (An aside: This drama, with uncovered emails, secret plans exposed, and J.K. Rowling-esque names is really only lacking a passion subplot. In the movie version, someone somewhere is going to be getting at least a canoodle.) Gawande is a brilliant, lucid, and enjoyable writer. And what a multitasker! (Surgeon and writer; I can barely keep up with the laundry and meet my deadlines.) But the story he tells about risk-taking is imperfect. Gawande tells the story of a fluke surgical crisis. An 87-year-old woman who entered the hospital to have her carotid artery unblocked survived the surgery but then developed gastric volvulus, a very serious condition. The team of doctors was able to solve the problem because they were prepared and calm in the face of chaos. It is imperfect because while the surgeons showed two traits crucial to risk-taking--preparation and calm--the emergency condition they were facing was not the result of their own risk-taking. It was a fluke. Since the surgeons were not the agents of the chaos, they didn't have to deal with the normal failure cycle risk-takers have to manage: the constant retracing of steps, the loss of confidence (if I screwed up taking the risk, why won't I screw up trying to solve it?), and the refusal to admit that your first risk-taking action was a mistake. The surgeons in Gawande's story are open to alternative diagnosis to solve the mysterious second illness, which is a good trait, but it's not the same as knowing how to unlock yourself from the entrenched defense of your original risk-taking decision. What we know for sure is that Dragas and Kington did not get the central message of Gawande's address to the graduating class at Williams College. Gawande concluded by saying: So you will take risks, and you will have failures. But it's what happens afterward that is defining. A failure often does not have to be a failure at all. However, you have to be ready for it--will you admit when things go wrong? Will you take steps to set them right?--because the difference between triumph and defeat, you'll find, isn't about willingness to take risks. It's about mastery of rescue. If there's one thing that everyone can agree on, it's that Dragas, Kington, and their anti-Sullivan cabal blew the rescue. They stood up in the lifeboat, they threw gas on the fire, they put the oxygen mask on the child first, and forgot themselves. Sullivan was very popular. That meant she had a big constituency.  Furthermore, she had served only two years. Her short tenure makes it hard to claim that she lacked the skills to get the job done when the same board had so recently hired her. If anything, she hadn't been given sufficient time even to be evaluated. There was a massive outcry when the news hit that Sullivan was leaving. (I too cried out. I sat next to Sullivan at an alumni event. I thought she was spectacular.) Alumni were asked to send their opinions by email, which nearly melted the servers. Everyone may have loved Sullivan, or they may have just been reacting to the clumsy and offensive way her firing was handled. Other voices have weighed in. Sullivan's predecessor, John Casteen, called for her reinstatement. So did the former Gov. Tim Kaine, who is running for the Senate. Gov. Bob McDonnell said the board had mishandled the whole business. The faculty passed a vote of no confidence in the Board of Visitors. A senior faculty member resigned, saying he didn't want to be associated with a school headed into the abyss. The American Association of University Professors wrote to the board, urging it to reconsider. The Cavalier Daily called on the whole board to resign. In the aftermath, the board, led by Dragas--which I swear is the name of a teacher of the Dark Arts in Harry Potter 8--was obscure, shifty, and defiant in the face of questions about what had led to the surprise firing. Dragas published a statement that was as serpentine as Mr. Jefferson's famous walls. It alternated between jargon, ass-covering, self-congratulation, and faux sympathy. She answered none of the pertinent questions related to Sullivan's ouster while declaring that any turmoil over how she had been fired stemmed from the board's excessive attachment to the ""truth."" A later statement from Dragas outlined some of the challenges the university faces but never addressed the central point: where Sullivan fell short. Perhaps it was part of some kind of a smart public relations move (ask the firm that authored it for her), but the document only exacerbated the belief that Dragas was never going to give the straight story. At an institution founded on intellectual inquiry, it is a bad idea to respond to questions with stonewalling. But it would be a mistake to think the board just mishandled the aftermath or that a different statement confected by a team of PR wizards would have helped. The calamity in the post-risk period of Sullivan's firing was baked into the initial risk-taking act. This is where the incomplete analogy in Gawande's speech is important. You must have a plan if your risk goes awry, but you also can't do things in the risk-taking that doom your clean-up effort. So when you're climbing a tricky pass on El Capitan without a rope, don't wear an anvil. When you launch a start-up, don't sign on with venture capital firms too fast or the money you get will cause you to grow too quickly, amplifying the early failures you'll inevitably have and putting you on the hook with merciless investors. Don't think because you've been successful making one kind of risky decision that you will be successful making others. Risk takers are actually highly cautious. They squeeze every ounce of chance out of their actions because they know what they're doing may fail. Dragas and her accomplices did the opposite. They hatched their plot in secret, and they never brought the firing to a full vote in front of the board. The dishonorable sneaky route can never work at a university where students must pledge at the bottom of every paper and exam that they did not receive or provide any assistance on the assignment. The board turned their risk into a reckless gamble. If they'd followed a fair approach, the anti-Sullivan group would have either given ballast to their ultimate judgment or discovered in the process that they were being hasty. Instead, they strapped on another anvil and headed up the mountain. The underlying debate between the Board of Visitors and Teresa Sullivan was over how to shrink and change the university when budgets are tight. The business-minded board members thought Sullivan wasn't up to the task. She lacked the corporate smarts and familiarity with hard-nosed tactics. They took a gamble in the name of a more business-oriented approach to university administration, but they did so without exercising what the smart CEO knows: Minimize risk. ""Sweeping action may be gratifying and may create the aura of strong leadership,"" said Sullivan in her defense, ""but its unintended consequences may lead to costs that are too high to bear."" She's right. The school is in chaos. The gamble didn't pay off. Tuesday, the board will meet again. Gov. McDonnell has said he will replace the entire board if they don't put an end to the controversy. Perhaps the board can regain its footing by embracing another piece of business jargon: ""Fail fast."" They should admit their mistake and bring back Sullivan."	How the New Yorker's Atul Gawande Caused the Debacle at UVA

The blue and red image was painted on drywall in his Iowa campaign offices in 2008. It echoes the famous Shepard Fairey poster and that first campaign when any treatment of the candidate's image could seem instantly iconic. Brad Anderson, Obama's current Iowa state director, cut it out and hung it in the campaign's 2012 location: a defunct Blockbuster video store that still has the mirrors on the ceiling used to thwart shoplifters. It's somewhat poetic: The Obama campaign is trying to rekindle its old glory in the shell of one of the businesses that went belly up during the economic downturn. Iowa was the emotional center of the 2008 Obama campaign. The state launched him when he beat Hillary Clinton in the caucuses. Obama went on to win the general election in Iowa by 10 percentage points, but that margin of victory was out of character for the state. President Bush narrowly won Iowa by 10,000 votes in 2004 after having lost it by less than 5,000 votes in 2000. Now, like the rest of the country, Iowa is reverting back to its normal condition--a 50/50 state with narrow electoral margins. The latest polls show Obama and Romney in a dead heat. In every calculation of how the candidates get to 270 electoral votes, Iowa is listed as a battleground state. But it's also a swing state. States like Pennsylvania and North Carolina will be contested by both sides, but the competition there will be more about turning out each party's base and topping those operations with success among the small number of swing voters. Winning in Iowa will be about courting the large number of moderate voters who are up for grabs. There are more registered independents in the state than registered Republicans or Democrats. Ten percent said they were up in the air, according to a recent NBC/Marist poll that had Romney and Obama tied at 44 percent. At this stage in the campaign, the Des Moines and Cedar Rapids media markets have been some of the most saturated in the nation with political advertisements. The state is so close that both sides even use the same language to talk about it. ""It started here and it ends here,"" says Sue Dvorsky, the chairwoman of the Democratic Party explaining why Obama will win. In an interview I did this week for CBS's Face to Face, Republican Gov. Terry Branstad said, ""We're the state that launched Obama but I think in this election we're the state that's going to sink him.""* If Iowa has emotional resonance for the president, it has a similar loaded history for Mitt Romney, who will end his six-state bus tour in Davenport, Iowa, on Monday. Iowa was central to Romney's 2008 campaign. He spent $10 million and blanketed the state. Mike Huckabee swooped in and stole his lunch, beating him in the caucus and marking the beginning of the end for the 2008 Romney campaign. In both the 2008 and 2012 campaigns, Romney had trouble with Iowa's evangelical voters. Polls show solid support among Republicans. ""When President Obama endorsed same sex marriage that changed it like that for anyone who was nervous about Mitt Romney,"" says Gov. Branstad, snapping his fingers. There are other reasons evangelicals will be motivated. In 2010, social conservatives worked together to unseat three judges who had overturned the state's same-sex marriage ban. Another judge, David Wiggins, is up for re-election in this cycle and the same organization of social conservatives are gunning for him. Wiggins is pugnacious and spoiling for a fight, so the race is likely to stir up some news coverage. It's unlikely the gambit will be successful, but committed evangelicals will turn out. While they're at the voting booth, they're likely to vote for Romney, too. Romney also benefits from Steve King. The firebrand GOP congressman is running in that portion of the state where Republicans do well. He is facing off in a redistricted 4th District against Christie Vilsack, the wife of the former governor and current agriculture secretary.* King is scrappy and a fierce critic of President Obama. Voters motivated to come out for him will add to Romney's numbers. What about middle-of-the-road voter? Like every battleground state, the undecided voters care most about the economy. In several battleground states, like Virginia and Ohio, the unemployment rate is below the national average. That means the fight to spin the economic message is a three way face-off between Obama, Romney, and the Republican governor. The unemployment rate in Iowa is 5.2 percent and dropping (the national average is 8.2 percent). The question then, in Iowa, is where the disconnect begins and ends between the way people think about their personal economic well-being and what they think about the national picture. They may see signs of an economic recovery but not credit the president, as appears to be the case in Ohio. Or they could feel things are getting better in their own lives and still have big concerns about the larger economy. Iowa Republicans think they know how to appeal to voters' concerns about the larger economy. ""Iowans are really scared about debt,"" says Branstad. Iowans have the lowest credit card debt of any state in the nation. The state is 38th in bankruptcies. Polling suggests Romney has an advantage on this topic. In the NBC/Marist poll, Romney beats Obama by 18 points when people are asked which candidate can better handle the debt (52 percent to 34 percent).* That's a much bigger margin than in any other battleground state. That's why Romney's advisers framed his recent speech in the state around the ""prairie fire of debt."" The advantage the Democrats have in Iowa is the same one they have in so many other states: their turnout machine. Already Democrats have opened more than 40 offices. Volunteers have been working voters for several years, developing the kinds of personal relationships that Republicans can't build overnight, even with loads of money. ""The physics of the thing is that you can't make up for time,"" says Dvorsky. The Obama campaign may have the best organization, but that may only get them so far in an election where the national condition is hard to overcome. The president's forces may have an amazing set of sharpened knives for this battle, but Romney has a 2-ton anvil he can drop from the heavens in the form of a bad economy. That's what may help the Romney campaign overcome its ground-game deficit and make it easier to persuade voters. Obama volunteers have to explain away disappointments and put things into context. That takes time and patience. Romney volunteers have an easier case.

That's what he says when he's asked directly, but he really proves it when he's talking about everything else. On issues from budget policy to leadership style to immigration, Bush, one of the most popular national Republicans, is a man out of step with his party. This does not mean he likes President Obama. He wants him out of office. He'd shove him if he could, for his repeated attacks on his brother if nothing else. But after listening to the two-term Florida governor talk to a group of reporters at a breakfast hosted by Bloomberg View on Monday morning, it's not clear how Bush could ever be the nominee of a party he says would no longer support his father or Ronald Reagan. It's not just that Bush's policy prescriptions on topics like immigration and tackling the deficit are a challenge to party orthodoxy. He also describes a more pragmatic vision of leadership--where accomplishments are valued over ideological purity--that seems deeply at odds with conservative calls for maximum constancy. This is perhaps the freedom enjoyed by those who are not running for president. But the formula Bush offers does reflect on the man who is running: Jeb Bush is describing a hole in American politics, and Mitt Romney is not necessarily the man to fill it. ""We're in decline which distinguishes us historically from where we've been,"" says Bush, who sees the economy shuffling along with anemic growth for the next year, no matter who wins in November. His solutions for getting out of the rut are less policy-specific--he doesn't have a grand plan about Medicare vouchers or getting rid of the home mortgage interest deduction. He's more focused on the temperament of governing. As a former governor, it's not surprising where he finds the best examples of leaders who are free of Washington orthodoxy and getting things done: ""Just about any statehouse in the country."" He singles out Indiana Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels and Colorado Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper for their effectiveness. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also gets praise. Among his qualities: He knows how to ""cut a deal."" Bush is not making a pitch for moderation or watered-down conservative principles, but for conservatism that goes beyond a talking point. ""Ronald Reagan would have ... a hard time if you define the Republican Party--and I don't--as having an orthodoxy that doesn't allow for disagreement, doesn't allow for finding some common ground,"" Bush said, adding that he views the partisan sclerosis as ""temporary."" ""Back to my dad's time and Ronald Reagan's time--they got a lot of stuff done with a lot of bipartisan support,"" he said. Today Reagan ""would be criticized for doing the things that he did."" If Bush is critical of his party, he is contemptuous of the Democrats. While he's vague about the GOP, he drills down to specifics about Democrats. In every detail, you can hear how they eat at him--from the Democratic members of the House budget committee ""who just read what some 20- or 25-year-old has handed them"" to the Senate's inability to come up with a budget. President Obama's big failing, says Bush, was his refusal to embrace the Simpson-Bowles commission he set up to find a way to reduce budget deficits. It was a failure of leadership, says Bush, who argues that had the president fought for the plan and lost, he would not have suffered politically. ""Presidents matter, and this president lost his chance to be a transcendent figure.""  Leadership, he argues, would have been the president's own political reward. ""Had he tried with sincerity and tried hard, he could make a compelling case 'Conservatives are against me, they're not for advancing the broader interests of this country.' "" This is a common complaint about Obama's leadership, and it doesn't seem to take into account that Obama showed just that kind of leadership pushing for health care reform. Asked to offer a bold example of presidential leadership, Bush pointed to his father's 1990 budget deal. It was undeniably an act of political bravery; the elder Bush betrayed his conservative base in order to reach a deal to reduce the deficit. ""It created the spending restraint of the '90s more than anything else that was helpful in creating a climate of more sustained economic growth."" This is where the tension over leadership attributes becomes acute. Where Jeb Bush sees a signature act of political leadership and bravery, conservative Republicans see a great apostasy. This isn't just some passing historical moment. It is a signature betrayal that Republicans point to again and again. Bush is doing something akin to a Red Sox fan cheering for Babe Ruth's trade to the Yankees. Grover Norquist, the Republican anti-tax advocate, dismissed Bush. ""He's just agreed to walk down the same alley his dad did with the same gang,"" he told Talking Points Memo. ""And he thinks he's smart. You walk down that alley, you don't come out."" The Bush 1990 budget deal makes for an interesting historical test. Mitt Romney's campaign won't say whether he has an opinion on this historical turning point. During the primary, Romney said he would not vote for a hypothetical budget deal that included $1 in tax increases for every $10 in spending cuts. (Bush and Daniels said they would.) That would suggest Romney is in the Grover Norquist camp. (He has signed Norquist's pledge.) So Bush would appear to be at odds with his nominee's worldview, except that Romney has also used support for the Bush budget deal as a signature test of leadership. When attacking Newt Gingrich during the primary, he singled out Gingrich's opposition to the Bush budget deal as a key Gingrich failure. Former Bush Chief of Staff John Sununu held a press conference to highlight Gingrich's lack of support. George H.W. Bush also cited Gingrich's opposition to the deal in his support of Romney. But according to the Norquist pledge that Romney has signed, Gingrich's opposition should be seen as an act of anti-tax heroism. In the hourlong discussion of leadership attributes, Mitt Romney was not among the ready examples Bush cited when talking about effective leadership. For a period of Romney's career, the former Massachusetts governor presented himself as just the kind of pragmatic, results-oriented politician that Bush describes. His signature accomplishment as governor, health care reform, is exactly what Bush was describing: a hard-fought deal that achieved something even though it meant working with Democrats. ""He was incredibly impressive, with his intellect, his ability,"" MIT economics professor Jonathan Gruber, a Democrat who worked with Romney on the plan, told Karen Tumulty. ""If there is anything that qualifies him to be president of the United States, it is his leadership on this issue."" When Bush did talk about Romney at length, it was about Romney's tough stance against illegal immigration. ""Governor Romney has used [his immigration position] to connect with a group of voters who were quite angry, and it was effective,"" says Bush, ""but now he's in somewhat of a box."" While Bush said the angry portion of the GOP electorate that's scared about porous borders has a legitimate point, Romney's task now is to appeal to different voters, namely Hispanics. Bush's prescription for political recovery is for Romney to pitch a broader economic message to Hispanic voters. Bush, who supported an in-state tuition plan similar to the one Mitt Romney attacked Rick Perry for promoting, says that he feels ""out of step with my party"" on immigration. He also has a larger complaint about the purity tests that rule politics today. ""I would hope that we don't just all have to march [in lock step.] If I'm a conservative and someone else is a liberal, we're sent a little book that says you must not veer. You have to embrace the orthodoxy of the moment."" Bush is not marching in line. The question is whether he's off on his own or whether the GOP nominee will take the party in a similar direction."	Is There Any Place for Jeb Bush in the GOP?

At the moment, he is hosting the annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative, which this year is taking a serious look at America's economic problems. He is also in the thick of the 2012 campaign, raising money for President Obama. The trouble is no one is better at articulating the case for Obama's re-election--while at the same time occasionally undercutting Obama's chances. Recently he has been on the wrong end of at least three different statements he has had to clarify--defending Bain Capital, testifying to Mitt Romney's ""sterling"" business career, suggesting the country was still in a recession, and suggesting he favored extending the Bush-era tax cuts. Clinton is doing such good work for Mitt Romney that he now appears in the Republican nominee's press releases. Even Sarah Palin praised Clinton last night, in an effort to make President Obama look way out of the mainstream. What is up with Bill Clinton? Everyone has a theory, which is part of the problem with Bill Clinton. He compels theories from people about his hidden machinations, even when there aren't any. So, let's consider a series of theories based on a round of conversations with Clinton watchers, former staffers, and allies: A storyteller in a Twitter world. Bill Clinton is at his best when he is telling a tale or reasoning something out with you. ""I could give a pretty good one,"" he once said to an Ames, Iowa audience about loping political speeches, ""'cause I came out of a tradition of storytellers where we listened and learned how to tell stories."" That doesn't really fit in the 140 character world of Twitter. The news cycle has sped up even faster since he was president. So has the phony outrage and games of gotcha. His talent for framing what the election is about is less valued and gets less play than the moments when he is off message. He's actually not off message. If you look at Clinton's so-called gaffes, they're not off message in any reasonable sense. When he said that Romney had a ""sterling"" business career, it was right up against a sentence that said he would not be a good president. When he said the Bush-era tax cuts should be ""extended,"" he was talking about a temporary extension to work out a deal with Republicans. Twice in the interview he said he did not support a permanent extension. The comment about the recession was simply an act of misspeaking. He has forgotten how to talk like a politician (because he doesn't have to). Bill Clinton speaks in paragraphs. He spends a lot of his time in long conversations with interesting people talking about global issues. That can deaden your political communications skills which--when sharp--allow you say nothing interesting about even the smallest issues. In order to navigate a world in which your every word is spliced, you must say nothing that can be taken out of context, which is to say, very little at all. The former leader of the free world isn't going to simply read talking points cooked up by the Obama campaign in Chicago, anyway. One strong dissenting voice among my interviews argued that while Clinton did have trouble adapting to the new world during the 2008 campaign, he's long since adapted. He thinks he is the smartest one in the room. Clinton thinks that the Bain attacks on Romney are inefficient and not smart. They also risk hurting major Democratic Party donors. In that CNN interview last week, he also clearly was sending a bigger message about how he thinks this election should be fought: on ideas about the future. That was a memo to the Obama team. It may have been an act of ego, but it was an act of ego to help Obama. This contradicts the theory of those who think that Clinton has been trying to undermine Obama for one reason or another. Occam's bushy beard. Occam's Razor says that the simplest answer is usually the right one. But in the political world people often believe the opposite is true. Practitioners and pundits (at the dinner table and in the green room) often search for the most baroque explanations to explain utterly common things. In medicine, this is known as Hickam's Dictum. So, when Clinton is simply running his mouth, it is interpreted to be subtle positioning to set up his wife's presidential run, or an attempt to undermine Obama's legacy so that Obama won't get elected to a second term and diminish the record of the last two-term Democratic president. He loves politics. As Taylor Branch wrote in The Clinton Tapes, ""[Clinton] never begrudged survival and ambition in politicians, whether friend or foe. Indeed, he reveled in calculations from opposing points of view."" For someone who loves politics this much, Clinton doesn't mind playing a few angles, for whatever purpose, so it's understandable to think every deviation he makes must be a clever stratagem. But when he's making a tactical move, says one who knows him, it's a little more obvious. He works his way to his point in a methodical way. That's not what people have seen in his supposed gaffes. He is angling for his wife. Bill Clinton was his wife's chief surrogate in 2008. He says the decision is up to her, but everyone assumes that he really wants her to make another run for president. So could he be sabotaging Obama to help his wife? That would require enough subtlety not to get caught, but would still need to be bracing enough to do Obama some damage. Even Clinton can't pull that off. But it's true, say those who know him, that Clinton is loyal to those who have helped him and his wife. That would explain his defense of Bain and it would also explain his warm comments about Donald Trump. No single theory explains Clinton. He contains multitudes. Which portion of which theory makes up the complete picture requires you to come up with your own alchemy. As for the Obama campaign, which must handle these little eruptions now and again, the best thing to do is to prepare for the occasional breakage of a family heirloom, because they're never really going to be able to control the St. Bernard."	Has Bill Clinton Lost His Touch?
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/06/gail_collins_on_the_might_of_texas_in_american_politics_.html	"This is an excerpt from As Texas Goes ...: How the Lone Star State Hijacked the American Agenda, by Gail Collins. My fascination with Texas began rather suddenly. It was the spring of 2009--you will remember, that was the season when the political right was failing to adjust to the idea of a President Obama. And there was Gov. Rick Perry at a Tea Party rally in Austin, publicly toying with the idea that his state might consider seceding. It was quite a moment. Perry was standing behind a podium with a ""Don't Mess With Texas"" banner, wearing jeans, his trademark boots, and looking pretty damned ticked off. ""Texas has yet to learn submission to any oppression, come from what source it may,"" he said, quoting the state's great founding father, Sam Houston. When Houston made that remark, he was definitely attempting to break away from the country to which Texas was then attached. ""We didn't like oppression then, we don't like oppression now!"" Perry roared to the cheering crowd, some of whom were waving ""Secede!"" signs. It did sure sound like an Alamo kind of crisis. Their backs were to the wall! And, important point: This was just a rally about the stimulus package. It was perhaps the first time the rest of the country had taken notice of the fact that 21st-century Texans did not necessarily consider the idea of breaking away to become a separate nation as, um, nuts. We non-Texans were somewhat taken aback. How long had this been going on? Was it something we said? ""We've got a great union,"" Perry assured reporters after the rally ended. ""There's absolutely no reason to dissolve it. But if Washington continues to thumb their noses at the American people, you know, who knows what might come of that?"" Does this sound like a serious commitment to you? Try to imagine a husband telling his wife that he saw absolutely no reason to get a divorce--but if she continued to fail to live up to expectations, who knows what might come of that? You had to pay attention. Not necessarily to Perry himself, who of course went on to become one of the worst candidates for president in all of American history. But the rally, with its combination of egomania (We're the best!) and paranoia (Don't mess with Texas!), was a near-perfect reflection of the Tea Party's war cry in national politics. That's not an accident. The more I looked at Texas, which seemed to be having an anti-Obama rally every time a cow mooed, the more important it seemed. Without anyone much noting it, Texas had taken a starring role in the 21st-century national political discussion. For one thing, it had the hottest economy--which the rest of us were told we'd better emulate unless we wanted all the local employers to pack up and move to Plano. The reason Perry imagined he could be president was the way Texas had created job growth by hewing to the low-tax-low-regulation ethic that the political right believes should be the model for the entire country. (The model had certain flaws, such as the assumption that every state could scrimp on higher education and just build a large professional class by importing people who went to college in other states.) Then a friend sent me a headline from a Texas news report: ""Man Allegedly Beat Woman with Frozen Armadillo."" I was totally hooked. So I started thinking a lot about Texas. Looking back over the last quarter century or so, I was stunned by how much of the national agenda it had produced, for good or ill. Texas banking laws set the stage for the savings and loan crisis in the 1980s. The 2008 economic meltdown was the product of a financial deregulation that was the work of many hands, but most particularly the paws of Texas Sen. Phil Gramm. Our energy policy is the way it is in large part because Texas politicians and Texas special interests like it that way. (If the polar ice caps melt, it's not going to be Utah's fault.) Schools from Portland, Ore., to Portland, Maine, have been remade, reorganized, and sometimes totally upended under a federal law based on Texas education reform. For several generations, our kids have been reading textbooks written with an eye to Texas sensibilities. Texas presidents have led the country into every land war the United States has been involved in since Vietnam. Texas runs everything. Why, then, is it so cranky? Is it because of its long string of well-funded but terrible presidential contenders? True, being the home state of Rick Perry, the ""oops"" candidate, had to be embarrassing. On the other hand, thanks to the Bushes, there's been a Texan president or vice president for 20 of the last 32 years, so the lack of White House access hardly seems like an appropriate subject for sulking. Is it the weather? The state of Washington has terrible weather, and you don't see people there threatening to secede. The crankiness is actually a source of Texas's political power. The state has a remarkable ability to be two contradictory things at once. It's a fast-growing, increasingly urban place whose citizens have nevertheless managed to maintain the conviction that they're living in the wide open spaces. And its politicians are skilled at bragging about the wonderful Texas economy and lifestyle while wailing and rending their garments over their helplessness in the hands of the federal Death Star in Washington. You need that sense of victimhood because it creates energy and unity. You can't build a Tea Party on good news. Another reason the Texas influence on the United States is outsized is that the place is just so damned big. The country has other hugely influential large states, like California and New York, but they're not on an upswing. California has more people, but it's hit a bad patch and it's struggling. New York is the media capital and it has Wall Street, but its population is flat. Texas just keeps growing, by leaps and bounds. (Think jackrabbit. It's a good metaphor. A really, really large jackrabbit.) The huge Texas population--up 4.3 million in a decade--has an enormous impact on the country all by itself. We've got a super-big state with a young citizenry and a very high birth rate. You have to figure that by 2050, the entire United States will have a distinctly Texas cast. The state's ability to rear, educate, and prepare all the little Texans to take their place in the national economy is going to be an excellent predictor of how well the whole country will be faring down the line. Spoiler alert: The odds of success would be better if Texas had more control of the teenage birth rate. Did you ever hear about the time Rick Perry defended abstinence-only sex education by saying that he knew from his own personal experience that abstinence worked? We're not used to thinking of Texas as a driving force in American affairs, but there you are. Even when Democrats held the White House in recent decades, Texans seemed to be holding the reins--reins that were being used mainly to hog-tie the chief executive. Bill Clinton had to deal with two Texans--House majority leader Dick Armey and whip Tom DeLay--whose lasting contribution to American history was mainly the thwarting of the Clinton agenda, particularly health care reform. Barack Obama has been hamstrung by the power of the Tea Party Republicans, whose first big coming-out parties were organized by Armey and whose ideology sprang, as much as from any place coherent, from the thinking of Texas congressman Ron Paul. You'd imagine a place with a motto like ""Don't Mess with Texas"" would be a small, scrappy state. But Texas is a huge, scrappy state. What could be more unnerving? And really, there's never a dull moment. Take the frozen armadillo situation. I couldn't resist looking into it, and at one point in my research I ran into an officer of wildlife enforcement who assured me that it was illegal to sell a live armadillo in Texas. ""Dead armadillos you can sell parts of them,"" he added. ""Make a curio of a little armadillo on his back drinking a bottle of beer."" How could you not want to know more about a state like that, particularly when it appears to have been setting the entire national agenda for decades, while continually howling about how the federal government is pushing it around? And the people are great. I can attest that I had a wonderful time with everyone I met while I was wandering around, trying to figure out how Texas inspired a national education law which the politicians in Texas now denounce on an almost hourly basis, or why a state that would get more economic benefit than anybody from the health care reform law is so determined to repeal the health care reform law. Anyhow, that's how I became obsessed with Texas. To paraphrase the old saw about elections and Maine, it really does seem as if these days, as Texas goes, so goes the nation.

8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/republicans_are_trying_to_stamp_out_voting_fraud_that_does_not_exist_.html	"When Americans go to the polls this November, they better have some ID. If they don't, millions of them won't be casting a ballot. Over the past two years, Republican legislators from Texas to Florida to Wisconsin and beyond have enacted new restrictions making it significantly more difficult for citizens to exercise their right to vote. These laws, which could disenfranchise more voters than at any time since the 1960s, exist because of one widely held conservative belief: that our elections are plagued with fraud. National Republican chairman Reince Priebus echoed this view on MSNBC recently when discussing the new Wisconsin law that requires citizens to produce photo ID at the polls or be shown the door. He argued that the state's election system was ""absolutely riddled with voter fraud."" Priebus may be correct, but only if his standard for ""riddled"" is 0.0002 percent. A nonpartisan study on voter fraud in Wisconsin after the 2004 election found just seven ineligible votes--all of which were cast by ex-felons who were ineligible to vote despite being released from prison--out of 3 million ballots cast. Yet the notion that voter fraud is rampant appears to have become a core belief among conservatives. Since the 2010 election, dozens of anti-voting measures have been enacted, from requiring photo identification to cutting early voting periods to mandating that citizens present a birth certificate or passport in order to register. If you challenge conservatives with just how rare voter fraud is in the United States, you usually get one of three responses: It's easy to do, it's hard to catch, and they've heard of it happening. Let's take these arguments one at a time. First, conservatives often note that even if widespread fraud hasn't occurred, the ease with which voters could misrepresent themselves at the polls warrants stringent preventive measures. Sting artist James O'Keefe has released a number of videos in which people show up at the polls with hidden cameras claiming to be someone they're not. The fact that most poll workers trust these individuals and hand over a ballot proves, in O'Keefe's estimation, that we need voter ID laws so people can't misrepresent themselves. This view ignores an important point: Regardless of how ""easy"" it may be to trick an unsuspecting poll worker, it rarely happens. And there is a simple explanation why: Voter fraud is a felony that carries a federal sentence of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. If I show up at the polls and pretend to be Michael McDonald, at best, I gain a single vote for my preferred candidate; at worst, I get sent to prison until 2017. Stealing an entire election one vote a time (and risking significant penalties for doing it) defies common sense. So does the logic that we must prevent any crime that's ""easy"" to do. It's really easy to dump a bucket of water on a policeman's head. In reality, it doesn't happen because people don't want to go to jail. Yet by O'Keefe's logic, the best way to prevent it would be to ban buckets. Second, many conservatives contend that the reason studies show so little voter fraud is because it's really hard to catch. It's also hard to catch murderers, but that doesn't mean we start locking up everyone in order to prevent people from killing one another. Americans have long subscribed to the notion of innocent until proven guilty; that, as Benjamin Franklin said, ""it is better 100 guilty persons escape than that one innocent person suffer."" Without proof, or even credible evidence that widespread voter fraud exists, saying that it's difficult to detect is not enough reason to justify stripping the right to vote from millions. Finally, those who suspect rampant fraud sometimes admit they are just relying on their gut; it simply feels like it exists. Of course, we've all heard the stories of dead voters in Chicago or suitcases of absentee ballots in the Deep South. Conservatives capitalize on these familiar chestnuts to make the case for restrictive new measures, often parading these old stories as modern facts. For example, South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson went on Fox News earlier this year to declare that ""we know for a fact there are deceased people whose identities are being used in elections in South Carolina."" Conservative outlets parroted the story endlessly, yet after a state investigation turned up zero evidence of fraud, they have gone silent. In truth, concerns about voter fraud usually stem from other conservative fears. The right believes that undocumented immigrants are menacing our country; therefore, they must also be trying to vote illegally. The poor, who liberals want to assist with food and health care, are being driven from poll to poll to ensure Democrats stay in office. If you're impoverished, the thinking goes, you must lack the moral fortitude that prevents the wealthier among us from voting more than once. Some Republicans admit they have seen no evidence of fraud. Last year, Pennsylvania State Sen. Charles McIlhinney conceded as much. Yet in his mind, the mere prospect that it could exist outweighed the possibility that 700,000 citizens may lose their vote in November because of the state's new voter ID law, which passed two months ago. Proponents of tough new voting restrictions often argue that voter fraud cancels out honest votes, effectively disenfranchising you and me. The irony is that by trying to stamp out a fraud menace that doesn't exist, millions of honest voters will be turned away from the polls. If widespread voter fraud existed, we should confront it. In the meantime, we shouldn't make policy out of tall tales and paranoid fears."	Why GOP Plans To Fight Voter Fraud Are Based on Pure Paranoia
9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/mitt_romney_and_donald_trump_are_holding_a_fundraiser_in_las_vegas_.html	"Mitt Romney and Donald Trump are teaming up for a Las Vegas fundraiser tonight. We've seen this movie before: The straight-laced square goes to Vegas with his outrageous friend and wakes up with a Mike Tyson tattoo, next to a woman who draws a heart over the ""i"" in her stage name. Romney's general-election strategy has been to allow no distraction from his focus on the economy. Trump's strategy is pure distraction. In neon. Recently he tried to raise--yet another time--questions about the president's birthplace. Today, Trump put the birthplace question at the center of the election: ""@BarackObama is practically begging @MittRomney to disavow the place of birth movement, he is afraid of it and for good reason. He keeps using @SenJohnMcCain as an example, however, @SenJohnMcCain lost the election. Don't let it happen again."" Mitt Romney is a risk-averse politician. His speeches almost never vary. He carefully limits his interactions with the press and sticks closely to the script because, as he explained, specifics can get you in political trouble. So it is notable that the Trump arm-lock is the second risk he has taken in a week. The first was a visit to Universal Bluford Charter School in West Philadelphia, a predominantly African-American neighborhood where there aren't many Republican voters. Now Romney's engaged with Trump, whose obsession with the president's birthplace--and the racial overtones of that quest--undoes the message Romney was trying to send the week before. Romney's visit to the Bluford Charter School was not a perfect photo opportunity. He was greeted by hecklers and challenged on his education policies by members of the audience, particularly his view that smaller class sizes are not crucial to improving education (a view he appears to share with Obama's secretary of education.) The Obama campaign sent out video of the event to embarrass him, but this was the kind of engagement we should want from our presidential candidates. In a campaign so starved for candor, Romney did something we should encourage in our thoroughly prepackaged and freeze-dried presidential campaign season. He visited a venue that wasn't stocked with prescreened supporters and he said something the audience didn't agree with on an important issue. Mitt Romney is not likely to get many new African-American votes in Philadelphia when running against an African-American president, but as a Romney adviser confirmed, his visit was also about appealing to moderate and swing voters in the suburbs outside Philadelphia. The event was an attempt to show that Romney is larger than just the candidate who has spent the primaries in the comfortable suburbs where Republican primary voters live. He is committed enough to education that he's willing to visit neighborhoods where Republicans are scarce. Obama isn't working for these kids, says the campaign repeatedly, but Romney will. The pictures of Romney in his tie and white shirt shaking a series of brown hands were a key part of painting the political tableau. The message is that no matter where you and I come from, I want to help, I want to listen, and you are not foreign to me, even though we come from different worlds. Now, having engaged in the symbolism of race, Romney meets with Donald Trump, whose fixation on the president's birth origin sends the opposite message: Barack Obama, Trump would have us believe, is something foreign and out of place. When a person fixates on the president's supposed African origins this much, it sends a racial signal: No matter how many present-day challenges require discussion, if you are a black president, someone with power and means is going to use your origins against you. Romney presumably asks voters to take him at face value when, as a wealthy white guy, he enters an African-American neighborhood. Trump doesn't cut Obama the same break. Trump insists race is not the issue--""I have a great relationship with the blacks. I've always had a great relationship with the blacks.""--but the Romney campaign doesn't have to certify him a stone-cold racist to recognize the totally incongruous clash Trump presents. One week your candidate stands with African-American schoolchildren in earnest concern, and the next week he stands enthusiastically with the most vocal barker of birtherism. Obama released his long-form birth certificate last year, which showed his birthplace to be Honolulu, Hawaii. Romney has said the issue was a settled matter. When asked about Trump recently, though, his answer suggested that he was braver in speaking truth to the audience in West Philadelphia than he was angering the Donald. ""You know, I don't agree with all the people who support me, and my guess is they don't all agree with everything I believe in. But I need to get 50.1 percent or more, and I'm appreciative to have the help of a lot of good people."" This was, however, another victory for candor: The need to get to 50.1 percent is the need to do what it takes to win. Does the Mitt and Donald movie matter politically? Almost certainly not. Romney is not running with Trump, so voters aren't going to get sustained exposure to him. For Romney, Trump is a useful tool. As the Donald himself put it: ""Part of the beauty of me is that I'm very rich."" He says he's noodling a super PAC, and he can raise money for Romney and gather together other people who can raise money. Romney certainly could never distance himself from Trump (let alone denounce him) for fear of alienating those donors the campaign is trying to reach by offering a dinner with the host of The Apprentice. Trump is probably popular with some of the working-class voters who cheer for a pugnacious loudmouth and whom Romney wants to attract. (That's why Romney used Trump to put a knee to Rick Santorum's groin with robocalls during the Michigan primary.) Elites who sniff at the Trump clown show were lost to Romney already. The only political downside would come if these two recent risks Romney took were to collide somehow. Say, if he does another event like the Bluford Charter School and one of the kids asks him to explain Donald Trump."	Why Is Romney Doing Vegas With the Donald?

He's an outsider--only one little local victory on the resume--in a year when that's still popular. His district, Kentucky's fourth, is a cluster of coal counties and rich suburbs that's started to go solidly GOP. By primary day, May 22, Massie had slightly outspent his two strongest opponents. And he won, by 45 percent to 29 percent over a highly-touted state senator. But the losers say the game was fixed. In the final stretch, Kentucky voters saw more than $500,000 of ads from Liberty for All, a new conservative super PAC funded entirely by a 21-year-old Texan heir to a real estate fortune. The heir, John Ramsey, did not mind the attention. ""We want to take the front lines,"" he told Mother Jones last week. ""We want to be the front-line PAC that takes the weight of the freedom movement on our shoulder."" In our post-Citizens United lives, the whims of a millionaire or billionaire can transform an election. Just this month, TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts's Ending Spending PAC bet more than $250,000 on Nebraska U.S. Senate candidate Deb Fischer. She won her primary. In Indiana, the Club for Growth bundled $330,000 and spent $1.45 million to help Richard Mourdock eliminate U.S. Sen. Richard Lugar. Two out of every five independent dollars in the Indiana race came from the Club. Mourdock won, too. If you're a conservative Republican, and you convince wealthy donors that you can take out a moderate, you can count on a super PAC to come and save you. And what if you're a liberal who wants to primary a wimpy Democrat? Not as easy. Imagine if a liberal billionaire wanted to seed some PAC--call it the ""Club for Socialism,"" maybe--and hunt for prey. Maybe he could buy into Hawaii's U.S. Senate primary between the progressive Rep. Mazie Hirono and the pro-Iraq War former Rep. Ed Case. Maybe California, where Sen. Dianne Feinstein--an icon of liberal betrayal ever since she was serving with Harvey Milk--had $4.7 million lifted from her war chest by a con artist. But there's no big liberal money available for that. Progressive tycoons exist, but they are reluctant even to give to President Obama's network. They're not interested in purifying the Democratic Party. It's a little hard to tell what they are interested in. Two months ago, Progressive Insurance founder Peter Lewis left the Democracy Alliance, a lefty donor coalition.  Earlier this month, billionaire George Soros made his first 2012 political donations--$1 million each to America Votes and American Bridge 21st Century. That's $23.5 million less than he gave to liberal groups in 2004. According to David McKay, chairman of the Democracy Alliance and board member of the Priorities USA super PAC, most big liberal money is going toward grassroots organizing. ""There's a bias towards funding infrastructure as it relates to the elections,"" he told the New York Times' Nicholas Confessore. Why no money to change the Democratic Party itself? The big guys aren't interested, and don't think it's possible. ""The reason there's not a Club for Growth-like organization on the left,"" says Soros spokesman Michael Vachon, ""is that there is a greater diversity of views in the Democratic Party than there is in the Republican Party. There's less of a hierarchically enforced ideological structure."" You can explain some of this with ideology. Conservatives and libertarians have no philosophical beef with Citizens United. More money in politics? You might as well say ""more freedom.""  That is not how the liberal mega-donors think. ""He finds it offensive to denigrate opponents,"" says Jennifer Frutchy, an advisor to Peter Lewis for 25 years. ""That's not how he wants to spend his fortune--in an arms race, taking down opponents. He doesn't want to be part of the negativity or corrupting influence money can have on the electoral process."" Can you have a Club for Socialism without mega-donors? No, it doesn't look like you can. The recent history of liberal ""accountability"" campaigns is largely depressing. Focus on three groups that launched or retooled after the 2008 elections--the Accountability Now PAC, the SEIU's North Carolina First, and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. All had grassroots reach. One had union muscle. Two of them are basically dead. Accountability Now started off strong. Its founders were Jane Hamsher, a pioneering blogger at Firedoglake, and Glenn Greenwald, the legal blogger-turned-author. It was rooted in the tradition of anti-sellout primary challenges--Hamsher had ginned up support for Ned Lamont's 2006 race against Sen. Joe Lieberman. (Lieberman lost the primary then beat Lamont as the Connecticut for Lieberman independent candidate.) Enemies like Lanny Davis buzzed about the PAC right away. But nobody donated to it. According to its post-election report from 2010, Accountability Now PAC raised only $77,973.95. And little of that went directly to candidates--it was chewed up by strategists and lawyers. ""It was really hard in 2010 to convince good progressives to challenge incumbents,"" says Greenwald. ""They perceived (accurately) that the general election would be an anti-Dem bloodbath, so why take all the huge risks to challenge an establishment-approved candidate?"" The PAC did what it could for Bill Halter, the lieutenant governor of Arkansas, who challenged Sen. Blanche Lincoln from the left. He lost. ""After that election, Jane and I both realized that even if Halter had won, it wouldn't have changed anything. He would have just blended into the Dem Party woodwork, would have been just another annoying centrist (like Ned Lamont would have been), and he would have been tied around our neck."" North Carolina First didn't even get that far. It was supposed to be a third party, set up by the SEIU and allied unions to run candidates against Democrats who voted against health care. It petered out before the midterms. But the PCCC has endured. It gathers potential donor names with frequent petition drives. (""Pass a new Glass-Steagall!"") It endorses early. It doesn't have all that much money. The PCCC raised $300,000 for the ill-fated Halter campaign. That's $200,000 less than the one check Sheldon Adelson cut for Scott Walker's recall defense campaign. Together with Democracy for America (founded by Howard Dean before he ruled the Democratic National Committee), it spent $2 million on Wisconsin campaign ads. Again, that is still less than a handful of Walker donors were able to chip in--and less than half as much money as sits in the pro-Newt Gingrich Winning Our Future super PAC. There are activists who fret about this, and there are activists who settle. A few veterans of the labor movement explained that the makeup of the Democratic Party, and the makeup of the country, simply doesn't allow for many progressive ""accountability"" campaigns. Stubborn Gallup polls tell them that ""conservatives"" outnumber ""liberals"" by a 2-to-1 ratio. If labor unions wanted to fund more super PACs, they'd be limited by the fact that their membership includes scores of conservatives. ""They are too concerned about their decline to challenge the party,"" argues labor veteran Rich Yeselson. Some liberal tycoons could fix that. Decades ago, they figured this out. In 1968, before the campaign finance reforms that (temporarily) made this impossible, a small group of mega-donors funded most of Eugene McCarthy's presidential campaign. The Democratic Party's official position on Vietnam was changed for good. Today's conservative mega-donors have merely reverse-engineered the strategy. But only six short years after they beat Lieberman with Ned Lamont, progressives can't convince the new tycoons to sign up again. ""We had so many Democrats undermine us that year,"" remembers Lamont's campaign manager, an old labor hand named Tom Swan. ""I think the right understood the Lamont-Lieberman primary better than progressives did."""	Why Are There No Powerful Liberal Super Pacs?
11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/george_zimmerman_s_defense_is_being_assisted_by_conservative_groups_.html	"At the start of May, right after Elizabeth Warren's first, toothache-inducing explanations for why Harvard had called her a ""minority"" hire, I started seeing a two-panel photo-editorial pop up on Facebook. On the left: An image of George Zimmerman's first mug shot, the one taken in 2005 after an accidental altercation with an undercover cop. On the right: A photo of a smiling, blonde-and-blue-eyed Warren. The Zimmerman photo had been labeled ""CRACKER."" The Warren photo: ""MINORITY."" The caption: Welcome to Left-Wing Bizarro World. The illustration originated at IOwntheWorld.com, a pugnacious conservative news-and-jokes site. The site went live on Jan. 20, 2009, just as Barack Obama was putting his hand on the Bible. Its better images were printed in full color and pasted to Tea Party rally signs. When the president said ""if I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,"" IOwntheWorld was ready with an image of Obama donning a hoodie. There's a theme here: The media and the race hustlers told us that George Zimmerman was a white, racist, murderer. You lied to us. Six weeks passed between the shooting of Trayvon Martin and the arrest of his shooter. If the Martin case was a campaign, you'd say that his family's attorneys ""won"" those weeks. Martin, dead at 17, was introduced to the world as an all-American kid, shot because he wore a hoodie. Zimmerman? The first image people saw of him was a mug shot of a ""white Hispanic"" guy. The first they heard from him was a heavy-breathing 911 call, one of many he made when he saw interlopers lurking at the Retreat at Twin Lakes. But ever since Zimmerman turned himself in, he's gotten the better of the story. NBC News, nationally and in Orlando, has apologized for a dishonest edit of the 911 call. (It was the dispatcher, not Zimmerman, who brought up Martin's race.) Investigators have released drips and drabs of their findings, including photos of a bloodied-up Zimmerman from the night of the shooting, and witness statements that suggest the armed, neighborhood watch volunteer feared for his life. In a normal case, we'd let the defense and the prosecution work this out. This is not a normal case. This is a national story, elevated by a statement from the president, a threat from the Justice Department, and several hashtags. It forced the resignation of Sanford, Fla.'s police chief. It got the Republican-run state of Florida to scramble and create a task force to look at the Stand Your Ground law, the hard-won legislation that would allow someone like Zimmerman to act in self-defense without first trying to retreat. The American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative consortium of state legislators, even deep-sixed the task force that had been work-shopping model Stand Your Ground language in different states. So Zimmerman's accidental allies learned to stand their ground. Gun rights advocates, who'd lobbied for Florida's law, were among the first to criticize the press for making the defendant look guilty. ""Everyday victims aren't celebrities,"" said NRA Vice President Wayne LaPierre at the group's annual convention. (He took the stage right before Mitt Romney.) ""They don't draw ratings, don't draw sponsors. But sensational reporting from Florida does. In the aftermath of one of Florida's many daily tragedies, my phone has been ringing off the hook."" It wasn't easy, sticking up for Zimmerman. But there was real anger out there about how he was being treated. The media was making him out as a thug and making Martin out as a saint. If you picked your news carefully, you could reverse the story. Before the arrest, conservative blogs found Martin's Twitter accounts and YouTube page and challenged the media's portrayal of a skinny, innocent kid. Meanwhile, according to Rush Limbaugh, Zimmerman just ""got a little overzealous,"" and the media called him a ""white Hispanic"" because ""you need white-on-black here to gin this up."" After the arrest, and as the police work's come out, it's gotten easier to defend Zimmerman. Shortly before he turned himself in, Zimmerman created a rudimentary website to raise money for his defense. He showed up for his bail hearing on April 20. Three days later, he made the $150,000 bail. The defense fund had filled up with more than $200,000. It was the least Zimmerman's supporters could do, to stop the railroading. Among his angels were the founders of Legal Boom, a local gun rights group, who'd been running their own fundraising drive. ""We spoke with George personally, for about 30 minutes,"" Legal Boom's Chris Kossmann told me.* They ended their campaign so he could focus on his, but they proved that there was sympathy and solidarity outside of the court of public opinion. ""If we hadn't done what we did, George wouldn't have raised that $200,000."" After the first fundraising burst, the official defense fund has been taking in around $1,000 per day. That's a steady clip, considering how public interest in the story has faded. The new updates on the case--the new bits of information from the investigation--have so far bolstered Zimmerman's version of the story. On Friday, Harvard Law professor and incorrigible legal commentator Alan Dershowitz started writing op-eds about how the media and the special prosecutor were ""biased against Zimmerman,"" and how the charge of second-degree murder would never hold up. On Saturday, he appeared on Fox News' Huckabee to expand on the theory. Where did the press get off, implying that Zimmerman had racially profiled Martin? ""It was the prosecutor who talked about profiling, in the affidavit itself!"" said Dershowitz. ""He didn't have any basis. It was just made up."" The host was flabbergasted. ""White Hispanic?"" asked Huckabee. ""I'm not even sure what that means."" Finally, after a public thrashing that made him infamous, Zimmerman was getting his story told. Few people were defending the way that the media had portrayed him--""white Hispanic,"" the selectively edited 911 call. If the left thought it was going to turn this into a debate about gun laws, it picked the wrong villain and the wrong victim. But this could have gone another way. There was one scenario that would have provided some swift justice for the Martin family without making Zimmerman infamous. That option: a timely arrest, and a police investigation. And that's what the ""hustlers"" said they wanted in the first place. Correction, May 22, 2012: This article originally misspelled Chris Kossmann's last name. (Return to corrected sentence.)"

12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/the_john_edwards_trial_why_it_was_so_dull_.html	"The grade-A dynamite evidence in the John Edwards trial, Exhibit 128, was a letter from the reclusive heiress Rachel ""Bunny"" Mellon, dated April 21, 2007, and addressed to Edwards' body man/consigliere/sycophant Andrew Young. Mellon was incensed at a Politico scoop about her candidate billing a pricey haircut to his campaign. ""It inspired me,"" she wrote. ""From now on, all hair cuts etc. that are necessary and important parts of his campaign ... Please send the bills to me c/o Alex Farger in N. York. It is a way to help our friends without government restrictions. Bang. This, according to government prosecutor David Harbach, proved that Mellon was intending to dodge campaign finance laws. The letter was the gorilla glue in the government's June 2011 indictment of Edwards. If Edwards goes down--the jury started deliberating today--this will be why. Mellon, according to the government, was the enabler of a massive conspiracy. But figuring this out didn't take a lot of digging by prosecutors. Mellon's letter appeared in Young's February 2010 cash-grab memoir, The Politician. Young described a letter ""written in delicate script on pale blue stationary,"" and explained what it promised. Mellon eventually cut six checks with phony memo lines (""antique chair"") to pay for the lifestyle of Edwards's pregnant mistress, Rielle Hunter. The most surprising fact about the John Edwards' trial is how unsurprising it was. In two years and three months, over the entire discovery period, the government's prosecutors found nothing better than this letter. The government evidence is clickable at this link (PDF). It's heavy on innuendo and heavier on embarrassment. It's awfully light on examples of clear-cut campaign finance abuse. The trove of recorded calls from John Edwards reveal that he was secretive= --""Elizabeth will probably be here in about 15 minutes, so the sooner you get this the better""--but not that he was directing his own conspiracy. What the government needed to prove was that Edwards broke the law with a plot to ""falsify, conceal, and cover up by trick, scheme, and material device"" the money used to cover up his affair. That money was passed along by two people: Bunny Mellon and Edwards campaign-finance chairman Fred Baron. Both of them approached the task with cheek. ""Old Chinese saying,"" wrote Baron (PDF) in one note to Young. ""Use cash, not cards!"" This, too, was in the Young memoir. The ""most heart rending moment of the trial,"" according to ABC News, came when a former Edwards ally testified about the candidate and his late wife having it out on ""an airport tarmac,"" Elizabeth Edwards tearing off her blouse to shame the scoundrel. Hearing the story in court caused their daughter, Cate Edwards, to tear up and bolt out. But the story was well known to readers of The Politician: It was on page 142. The prosecutors had great material. But they had nothing new to prove that Edwards violated campaign-finance law by letting Bunny Mellon and Fred Baron bail out Hunter. To do so, Edwards needed to take unregulated, secret money ""provided for the purpose of influencing the presidential election."" Did the $900,000 of Mellon/Baron cash qualify? The best evidence came from Young. In his memoir, Young dates the cash-for-Rielle plan back to a mini-crisis in 2007, when Elizabeth Edwards got too curious about an expense someone had made in New York when her husband was on the West Coast. Young shelled out for Hunter's expenses. Edwards ""promised I would be repaid when a wealthy benefactor was recruited to cover these costs or when Mrs. Edwards died."" Months later, the wealthy benefactors were found. Pure sleaze, but did it represent a campaign-finance law abuse? Edwards told his aide that he would paper over the Hunter expenses with the help of dupes. The key dupe, Mellon, offered the money for ""necessary and important parts"" of the campaign, as they related to Edwards himself--expenses like his haircuts, a part of his livelihood that was billed to the campaign only by accident. Young and Edwards took her for a ride, but as Richard L. Hasen pointed out when the trial began, the FEC precedent that does the most for the prosecution claims that friendly cash isn't a ""contribution"" if ""gifts of a personal nature... had been customarily received prior to candidacy."" Mellon had opened her checkbook for Edwards's causes before he made the 2008 bid. Edwards subsequently used her to cover up his personal life. Still, the prosecution may have done enough. According to the jury instructions from Judge Catherine Eagles, ""The government does not have to prove that the sole or only purpose of the money was to influence the election. ... People rarely act with a single purpose in mind."" The jurors' job is to determine whether the money was provided ""for the purpose of influencing an election."" The Mellon letter expressly says that she's thinking about ""the campaign."" Bang. You can see why Edwards's defense team rested without letting their client speak for himself. The prosecution merely needed to remind jurors of the many colorful ways in which the Man Who Might Have Been Vice President disgraced himself. He duped Mellon liked he duped everybody else. You don't need a new story to send him to jail."	"Why the John Edwards Trial Was So Surprisingly Dull

13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/survey_bias_how_can_we_trust_opinion_polls_when_so_few_people_respond_.html	"When you get a call on your cellphone from an unfamiliar number, do you answer it? If the person on the other end of the line immediately tries to assure you they're not trying to sell you anything, do you believe them? If they tell you they're conducting a public opinion survey that will only take a few minutes of your time, do you go ahead and start sharing your views on religion, gay marriage, the economy, and the upcoming election? If you answered ""yes"" to all those questions, congratulations! You're among the 9 percent of Americans whose opinions stand in for those of the nation as a whole in public opinion surveys. The nonprofit Pew Research Center is one of the least biased, most reliable polling organizations in the country. When they tell you that only one-half of Americans believe Mormons are Christians, one in five U.S. adults still doesn't use the Internet, and that a majority of Americans now support gay-marriage rights, you'd like to think you can trust them. Recently, though, Pew decided to turn the spotlight on the reliability of its own research. What it found was alarming: Fewer than one in 10 Americans contacted for a typical Pew survey bothers to respond. That's down from a response rate of 36 percent just 15 years ago. Why should we care? Two of the top stories in the presidential campaign at the moment are Mitt Romney's ""woman problem"" and Barack Obama's move to support gay marriage. But do women really dislike Romney? And was Obama boldly taking an unpopular stand, or capitalizing on a shift in public attitudes? A new CBS/New York Times poll has raised eyebrows (and the Obama Administration's ire) by suggesting that Romney actually leads among women--and that most people still oppose gay marriage. If such polls aren't reaching a representative subset of the populace, it's hard to know what to believe. (Disclosure: Slate has teamed up with SurveyMonkey for a series of monthly political surveys. These surveys are different from Pew's polls in that they're intended to provide a snapshot of the electorate, not a scientific reading of the nation's preferences.) This isn't just a Pew problem. Response rates to telephone surveys--which since the late 1980s have been the standard for polls attempting to reach representative samples of Americans--have been sliding ever since people started ditching their landlines. For many possible reasons--including mobile phones' prominent caller ID displays and the ""vibrate"" option--far fewer people these days pick up when a stranger calls at 8 p.m. on a weeknight. Those who do answer their cellphones are often teens too young to be eligible for the polls. And when they do pick up, they're less likely to hand the phone off to an adult in the household. Survey outfits' initial response to the cord-cutting trend in the early 2000s was to ignore it. But the response rates of even those who still have landlines have also dropped off of late. And besides, it soon became clear that calling only landlines created serious problems with their data. Landline surveys, for example, reach more Republicans than Democrats. Given that polls are often judged on their resemblance to actual election results, such findings gave organizations plenty of incentive to bring cellphones into the mix, despite the added hassle and expense. The best pollsters now carefully weight their calls between landline and mobile phones to match their prevalence in the population as a whole. (Though there's no public cellphone directory, wireless providers make their lists of active numbers available to polling organizations.) But that hasn't fully solved the survey nonresponsiveness problem. To understand why, consider the difference between these two statements: 1) One in five U.S. adults doesn't use the Internet. 2) Of the 9 percent of U.S. adults who respond to telephone opinion surveys, one in five doesn't use the Internet. The second sounds less definitive, right? But how much less definitive? We don't know. And that's the root of the problem. A lower response rate, on its own, doesn't necessarily imply flawed results. In a widely cited 2006 paper, University of Michigan professor Robert Groves--now director of the U.S. Census Bureau--explained how efforts to increase response rates can actually lead to less reliable data. Groves cited a 1998 study in which exit pollsters offered some voters a free pen if they participated. That increased the response rate, but for some reason, Democrats were more enticed by the pens than Republicans, skewing the results. How can we tell if Pew's low response rate affects its findings in a given survey? We need to know whether the 91 percent who decline to respond differ in their attitudes from the 9 percent who participate. Pew's new meta-survey attempted to find out. It did this by comparing the results of one of its own telephone surveys to the findings in benchmark U.S. government surveys, which have response rates of 75 percent. Some of the discoveries were comforting. It seems that Republicans and Democrats are equally disinclined to take Pew's calls, diminishing the risk of misgauging a presidential race. And Pew's respondents are registered to vote at about the same rate as the wider population. But there are some striking differences. Of the people who respond to Pew surveys, 55 percent said they had volunteered for an organization in the past year--more than twice the percentage among respondents to the government's surveys. Fifty-eight percent said they had talked with their neighbors in the past week, compared to 41 percent of those reached by the government. And Pew respondents were more than three times as likely to have contacted a public official in the past year. Those results make some intuitive sense. Survey respondents tend to be people who are more inclined to share their time with people they don't know well. Still, Pew was wise to ask these questions: It now knows to look out for these biases in future survey results. (The government, for its part, must be careful to account for the fact that its respondents are disproportionately U.S. citizens, presumably because noncitizens aren't eager to talk to government officials about their immigration status.) There were also some oddities in Pew's results, however. Its respondents are somewhat more likely to be smokers, more likely to be on food stamps, and--perhaps surprisingly--more likely to be Internet users. Groves, the census director, tells me that telephone surveys also tend to reach fewer urbanites and fewer people who live alone. The differences aren't huge, but they're enough to make anyone wonder: Just what other attributes might differentiate survey respondents from the average American? On most issues that Pew studies, we may never know, because there aren't government benchmarks for, say, the number of people who would consider voting for a Muslim congressional candidate. ""Nonresponse bias,"" as this is called, is just one of the many types of bias that can skew poll results. There's the famous (and controversial) ""Bradley Effect,"" in which white respondents overstate their willingness to vote for a black candidate when they're on the phone with another person, because they don't want to seem racist. Polls conducted by snail mail may overrepresent the elderly. (That's called ""coverage bias."") And there are all the ways in which the framing of a question can affect people's answers. A classic example: People are much less likely to favor cuts to U.S. foreign aid spending if told ahead of time that it makes up just 1 percent of the federal budget. (The average voter believes it's more like 25 percent.) To be clear, all of these are distinct from your run-of-the-mill sampling error--the small degree of inaccuracy inherent in any poll administered to only a portion of a population. Sampling error, in contrast to nonresponse bias, is easily estimated (and typically reported along with results). For what it's worth, surveys today are probably more reliable on the whole than they were 30 years ago. Back then, most reputable polls were conducted door-to-door, because landline phones weren't yet prevalent enough to provide a representative sample. Perhaps, then, the 1990s and early 2000s--when the best public-opinion surveys served as incredibly reliable proxies for the views of the populace--were a short-lived golden age in American public-opinion research. The ability to reach almost every U.S. household might have been a historical anomaly, a fortuitous side effect of a particular set of technological circumstances. Can polling ever get back to that level of reliability? Perhaps. Michael Dimock, associate research director for the Pew Research Center on People and the Press, admits that technological flux is always a problem for pollsters, but believes they find ways to adjust eventually. Meta-studies like Pew's are a good first step. And Robert Groves, the census director, tells me improvements in Internet-based data mining are already helping to fill in some of the gaps in traditional sample surveys. A phone survey focusing on the number of people who want to sell or buy houses, for instance, can now be complemented by data from Realtor.com. ""The big story is that how we measure humans is undergoing fantastic changes,"" Groves says. ""We're in the middle of the revolution."" Will that revolution be the death of pollsters? Survey says: too close to call."	Only Weirdos Respond to Opinion Surveys. Can We Still Trust Them?
14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/joe_ricketts_jeremiah_wright_obama_ad_campaign_proposal_exposes_the_right_s_rage_.html	"Mitt Romney wants to make the 2012 election a referendum on the economy. Facing an electorate that likes Barack Obama personally, Romney has said again and again that Obama is a nice guy who just doesn't know how to create jobs. The last thing Romney needs is a rogue, richly funded right-wing campaign to change the subject from Obama's job performance to his character, particularly a rerun of the 2008 attack on Obama's ties to the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. But that's what Romney will get, if Republican donors and operatives can't control their rage. The latest sign of trouble is a proposal for a $10 million ad campaign, commissioned by TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts and drafted by advisers to John McCain's 2008 presidential candidacy. The plan proposes to fund television, newspaper, and outdoor ads, starting with an already scripted five-minute video. The script and proposal, leaked to the New York Times--and subsequently renounced by Ricketts after the ensuing uproar--are politically insane. But they offer an instructive psychiatric portrait of the rage in Romney's party. Too many conservatives are too angry to think straight. The ad campaign proposal begins with a problem for Republicans: Voters ""still aren't ready to hate this president."" The word ready makes clear that this is where the plan's authors eventually want to go. The dilemma with regard to voters and Obama, they write, is ""how to inflame their questions on his character and competency, while allowing themselves to still somewhat 'like' the man."" The plan's stated challenge is an emotional tension in the electorate. But the tone conveys an emotional tension among the authors: how to express their contempt for Obama in a way that doesn't alienate the public. Revulsion oozes from every frame of the video script, though the authors try to pin the hatred on Obama. ""Week after week, year after year, he heard the hatred,"" the script says of Obama's attendance at Wright's sermons. It says Obama ""attacked and inflamed,"" leaving us a world ""wracked with hate-filled passions."" At one point, the script depicts Obama pushing a gurney (symbolizing Obamacare) past a family whose ""eyes follow him with disgust."" Why must we hate Obama? Because he hates America. The insertion of Obama's middle name in the title of the video script booklet--""The Defeat of Barack Hussein Obama""--signals the message. Beside a picture of Obama with Wright, the script alleges, ""There's simply a fundamental difference between his view of America and ours."" It adds: ""He was taught for years that America WAS the problem, so how could he ever believe that America could be the solution?"" Beneath the hatred, humiliation boils. ""Our plan,"" the authors write, is to show how Obama and his left-wing mentors ""brought our country to its knees."" Accompanied by images of Obama bowing to foreign heads of state, the script asks: ""How can our president stand up for America when he's bowing, begging, kneeling and apologizing for America?"" Later, it repeats that Obama ""compulsively bowed and apologized to foreign leaders."" Even on the economy, the script says Obama ""brought us to our knees."" A caption placeholder calls for an image of a struggling American ""literally on his knees in shame."" Hilary Rosen's recent crack about Ann Romney reminded Democrats that it's nearly always a bad idea to target the candidate's wife. But authors of the proposed anti-Obama video can't resist strafing the First Lady. Their frame introducing Wright calls him ""the pastor who married Barack Obama to Michelle."" They can't even restrain their language. After showing Wright's ""God DAMN America"" quote--twice--the script retorts that Obama ""promised change. But it damn sure wasn't the change we expected."" Nor can the authors suppress their urge to refight the last election. Obama has been president for three and a half years. Throughout his term, the economy has sucked. His whole reelection strategy is to ignore that disappointment, rewind history, and rerun the 2008 campaign. This video would help him do that. It dwells less on his presidency than on our folly in electing him. ""How did we overlook that?"" the script asks, recalling Obama's ties to Wright. ""Should we have known? Should we have known? Perhaps there is no more important question."" And again: ""Should we have known when we learned his mentor blamed America for the 9/11 attacks ... right after the planes hit?"" The draft concludes with white text on a black screen: ""Seldom in life do we have a second chance to make the right decision."" The authors seem angry not just at Obama, but at voters. They want to focus attention not on 2011, but on 2001. They're angry at McCain, too. They blast him for refusing to use Wright against Obama in 2008. They call McCain ""a crusty old politician who often seemed confused."" Freed from his good judgment, they look forward to fulfilling their urges: ""Our plan is to do exactly what John McCain would not let us do."" They won't get their wish just yet. Some insider, recognizing the insanity of the proposal to Ricketts--and apparently alarmed that it might soon be implemented--leaked it to the Times. Outrage erupted, and Ricketts scrapped it. But this fight isn't over. The people behind this proposal or named in it include McCain's media adviser, McCain's Internet strategist, and Jon Huntsman's pollster. Such people, and others like them, can make things happen, particularly with the aid of sympathetic freelance financiers. Ricketts is a major conservative donor. His son is a member of the Republican National Committee. As the proposal points out, Ricketts has felt for some time that Republicans should have used Wright more aggressively against Obama in 2008. For now, the Times leak has put a lid on the right's rage. But the pot is still boiling. Look out."	The New Attack on Obama and Jeremiah Wright Exposes the Right's Rage

His sin: a subpoena, first reported by Nicholas Confessore, for ""e-mails, bank records and other documents"" from the National Chamber Foundation and the Starr Foundation. His questions: Has the U.S. Chamber of Commerce been playing Criss Angel tricks with campaign money? Did the National Chamber Foundation hand $18 million over to the mothership so it could be used on politics? The problem, for Schneiderman, is that even attempting to track down the sources of ""dark money"" has become controversial. ""In the midst of a highly charged political season,"" said senior vice president Thomas J. Collamore, ""it comes as no surprise that the New York State Attorney General would use his office to rehash a very old story about the Chamber's finances. The subpoena they have issued closely resembles a politically motivated letter that an activist group sent to the IRS in 2010, also just before an important election."" That's right on message. A growing number of Republican and conservative voices characterize efforts to disclose campaign contributions as bullying, intimidation, and a threat to free speech. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has handled the intellectual heavy-lifting. On June 15, McConnell addressed the American Enterprise Institute on the ""growing threats to our First Amendment rights."" The major threat was the DISCLOSE Act, the Democratic bill that would (short version) force all political campaign groups to open their books. ""If disclosure is forced upon some but not all,"" said McConnell, ""it's not an act of good government, it's a political weapon. And that's precisely what those who are pushing this legislation have in mind. This is nothing less than an effort by the government itself to exposes its critics to harassment and intimidation, either by government authorities or through third-party allies."" Nothing less. McConnell read out the names of the victims. Charles and David Koch, charitable businessmen who employ ""tens of thousands of people,"" had suffered because a presidential aide ""insinuate[d] they'd done something shady on their taxes,"" and an Obama campaign e-mail informed donors of ""a Koch-backed event, presumably to incite just the kind of mob that showed up."" Idaho businessman Frank VanderSloot, who'd merely been ""speaking out on behalf of candidates and causes the president opposes,"" had appeared on an Obama campaign website about six-figure Romney donors. After that, ""people were digging through his divorce records, cable television hosts were going after him on air, and bloggers were harassing his kids."" Dozens of Tea Party groups had ""received a lengthy questionnaire from the IRS demanding attendance lists, meeting transcripts, and donor information."" That last item stood out. Maybe the IRS should demand data from new activist groups that want tax exemptions, but it's irritating, a threat from the government. Taxpayer money was funding an inquest backed by the taxpayer-funded police force. You couldn't say that about anything else McConnell mentioned. As he defined it, any public criticism was a threat to their free speech. Conservative activists are with him on this one. The same day that McConnell gave this talk, David Koch's Americans for Prosperity was bringing activists into the Las Vegas' Venetian Hotel for the annual RightOnline conference. (Koch chairs AFP and donates an undisclosed amount to the group.) Koch conservatives huddled in a Sheldon Adelson hotel? Bloggers should be proud. ""I know the left hates guys like Sheldon Adelson,"" said AFP president Tim Phillips, ""and frankly, our foundation chairman David Koch. But that's OK, because we love 'em! Right? We love these guys, who go out and create jobs and prosperity!"" According to Phillips, the left hates rich donors because they're rich. You can certainly find some bilious left-wingers who feel that way. Roll tape of one of the Occupy protests that got meta-occupied by Black Bloc anarchists in kaffiyeh chokers. Listen to the audience applause for a Colbert Report segment about Mitt's car elevator and Ann's dancing horse. Read Atlas Shrugged again. ""The man who damns money has obtained it dishonorably,"" says Ayn Rand's copper mining scion Francisco d'Anconia. ""The man who respects it has earned it."" Ah, but if only every donor was an Ayn Rand character. They'd give better speeches--real stemwinders, sentences running on sentences like a babbling country stream. They also wouldn't want anything from the government. We can't say that for every donor, can we? That's why we want to know who they are. One example: We know a lot about George Kaiser, the Tulsa multimillionaire who bundled for the Obama campaign and subsequently used White House meetings to convince people that Solyndra would pay off if it got the right-sized loan guarantee. If we didn't read about him in Carol Leonning's stories for the Washington Post, we could have seen the Americans for Prosperity ads about him. ""Solyndra investors raise campaign money for Obama,"" sighed AFP's narrator. ""The government gives half a billion dollars in taxpayer money. Politics as usual."" The point of the ad is that wealthy people sometimes give to campaigns, exercising a few million points of free speech, because they want to influence how the government moves money around. A green energy investor might donate to Democrats who think green energy will save Gaia. Somebody on week 97 of unemployment might vote for the candidate who extends unemployment insurance. A brown energy investor probably wants Barack Obama to lose so that a new EPA and Interior Department will lay off already with the regulations. Nah, strike that--they're probably just operating in enlightenment and good faith. The American Action Network, the latest group to join this campaign against disclosure, produced a web ad that starts with images of D-Day--""heroes fought and died for our rights""--and shows the First Amendment literally vanishing, like Marty McFly in Back to the Future, as McConnell warns of the Obama threats. But there's no evidence that Obama is using the tools of government--as opposed to PR and speeches--to attack his enemies. Gavin Aronson points out that liberal-leaning good-government groups like Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the Campaign Finance Center have asked the IRS to investigate 501(c)(4)s that enjoy preferred tax status and use it for ""educational"" campaigns that are basically just Obama-phobic infomercials. That's more than the administration's tried to do, at a time when Super PACs are battering it with ads. At AEI, the only privacy leak cited by McConnell was that ""IRS information found its way into the hands of a staunch critic on the left who also happens to be a co-chairman of President Obama's re-election committee."" This was an oddly veiled reference to the National Organization for Marriage, not a tycoon, and the leak-promoter was the Human Rights Campaign. The only organizational threat was an ""IRS decision revoking the tax-exempt status of small political nonprofit groups that undoubtedly foreshadows an effort to do the same to bigger groups on the right that the Obama administration regards as a threat to its campaign."" The group: Just one, a Democratic candidate-training combine called Emerge America. Nixing a tax break, or checking whether or not a group deserves the tax break, or asking who funds it--it's all a ""thuggish"" threat to free speech. Apparently, the difference between an ad that says ""paid for by Sheldon Adelson"" and an ad that keeps it quiet is a jackboot stomping on a human face."	Why Do Conservatives Think Campaign-Disclosure Laws Are So Scary?
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/06/teresa_sullivan_reinstated_as_the_president_of_the_university_of_virginia_.html	"Last Saturday, I followed my father as he guided my sisters and me around the hyper-Modernist campus of the Illinois Institute of Technology on the south side of Chicago. Fifty years ago, he completed a Ph.D. in chemistry and began his pursuit of a dream of being a professor at an American university. We had gathered there to honor and thank him. One of my sisters, a librarian at the University of Chicago, presented him with a bound copy of his dissertation. My father was a young man in his mid-20s when he arrived on a train from New York, after boarding a ship from London, after flying from Bombay, after a train from Madras, India. He had come to Chicago when he was one of only about 300 Indians in the whole city, almost all of them young men struggling to be engineers or scientists. My father arrived unprepared for Chicago winters, or any winters, for that matter. He was a vegetarian. He was a Hindu. He had dark skin in a country where that fact excluded him from entry to some places and contact with some people. And he was lonely and homesick. Undeterred and drunk on the optimism that only Eisenhower's America could provide, he put his faith in the American system of higher education to transform his life and give him the chance to use his mind to contribute to the boom in scientific knowledge that this country once sponsored and celebrated. He retired a few years ago after 40 years on the faculty of the State University of New York at Buffalo. He raised and educated three children. And he instilled in them a cosmopolitan sensibility and a deep respect for science and knowledge. He taught brilliant students and did some excellent science along the way. My father embodies the potential of the American higher-education system. It's something people around the world envy. It's something governments around the world wish to emulate. I thought of the risks and sacrifices my father made back then yesterday as I stood on the grounds of another great American institution of higher education, the University of Virginia, to welcome back its president, Teresa Sullivan. Helen Dragas, the rector of the Board of Visitors, which runs the university, had requested Sullivan's resignation two weeks ago in a botched attempt to circumvent usual board procedures. Sullivan resigned quickly, quietly, and with dignity. Sullivan stayed out of the way as news leaked out that the ouster was ideologically driven, executed by a tiny cabal of extremely wealthy alumni, and against the wishes of almost every student, alumnus, and faculty member of the university. Apparently, Dragas wanted a president who would act more like a corporate CEO, someone who would push the university toward radical change, ignore pleasantries like orchestrating consensus among faculty and students, and roll out online gimmicks with reckless abandon. Dragas demanded top-down control and a rapid transition to a consumer model of diploma generation and online content distribution. She wished to pare down the subjects of inquiry to those that demonstrate clear undergraduate demand and yield marketable skills. Such a purely transactional institution would have no appeal to a young immigrant scientist who needed time and space to explore a variety of big research questions. Sullivan, a proud consensus-builder and incrementalist, resisted such mindless calls for radical dismantling. So she was forced out. After two weeks of massive protests, online activism, and a media blitz orchestrated by faculty and students who seemed far more deft at media relations than the wealthy Dragas and her hired public relations firm, Hill & Knowlton, the entire board relented and voted unanimously to invite Sullivan back to her job. Sullivan took the microphone after a 30-minute board meeting at which everyone said nice things about each other and the university. ""We have problems at UVA--all of higher education does,"" Sullivan said. ""We are not in crisis, but change appropriate to our mission is necessary. ... I am heartened by the fact that the events of the past week have created in us a spirit of unity that can help us make the needed improvements more quickly. The great strength we have discovered is how deep our commitment to this university runs, and how unified we can be when we pursue its best interests."" I stood there on Thomas Jefferson's lawn as everyone in the crowd exhaled with relief. Pleased, tired, and impressed by my students' devotion to this place, I hugged my colleagues and high-fived students. But I am not comforted. This fight is not over. We Americans take these institutions for granted. We assume that private enterprise generates what is so casually called ""innovation"" all by itself. It does not. The Web browser you are using to read this essay was invented at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The code that makes this page possible was invented at a publicly funded academic research center in Switzerland. That search engine you use many times a day, Google, was made possible by a grant from the National Science Foundation to support Stanford University. You didn't get polio in your youth because of research done in the early 1950s at Western Reserve University School of Medicine.* California wine is better because of the University of California at Davis. Hollywood movies are better because of UCLA. And your milk was not spoiled this morning because of work done at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. These things did not just happen because someone saw a market opportunity and investors and inventors rushed off to meet it. That's what happens in business-school textbooks. In the real world, we roll along, healthy and strong, in the richest nation in the world because some very wise people decided decades ago to invest in institutions that serve no obvious short-term purpose. The results of the work we do can take decades to matter--if at all. Most of what we do fails. Some succeeds. The system is terribly inefficient. And it's supposed to be that way. Along the way, we share some time and energy with brilliant and ambitious young people from around the world. Many of them have the look that I imagine my father had when he showed up, coatless, at the front door of the chemistry building at IIT in 1956. They show confidence. They also show innocence. They are willing to listen to the wisdom of experience. But they believe in themselves enough to question it at every turn. Many of these young people visit me and ask if the University of Virginia is right for them. It usually is. But we can take only a sliver of those who want and deserve to enroll. As President Sullivan strives to heal the wounds of the past two weeks and looks forward to fulfilling her goals, she will be trying to manage a significant increase in enrollment. Yet the resources we have to ensure these new students do as well as their predecessors are getting tighter and tighter. We will all work harder and smarter to make it work. But many of us are at the breaking point. We hear every day from higher-education pundits who can't seem to express themselves in anything other than jargon and buzzwords that American higher education is ""unsustainable."" No. It's just not adequately sustained. There is a big difference. We could choose to invest in people. We could choose to invest in culture. We could choose to invest in science and technology. We choose instead to imagine that there are quick technological fixes or commercial interventions that can ""transform"" universities into digital diploma mills. Pundits blame professors for fighting ""change."" But they ignore the fact that universities are the chief site of innovation and experimentation in digital teaching and research and that professors might actually know what works and what does not. Instead of holding up their responsibility, states are divesting themselves of the commitment to help their young people achieve social mobility. States are rigging the system so that only the wealthy can compete for slots in the best universities. States shift the cost of higher education from taxpayers--all of whom benefit from living in a wiser, more creative society--to the students themselves. Yet students keep coming, desperate to enter the privileged classes, unable to imagine a different way through a cruel economy that has no use for the uneducated any more. Universities are supposed to be special places where we let young people imagine a better world. They are supposed to be able to delay the pressures of the daily grind for a few years. They are supposed to be able to aspire to greatness and inspire each other. A tiny few will aspire to be poets. Many more will aspire to be engineers. Some will become both. Along the way they will bond with friends, meet lovers, experience hangovers, make mistakes, and read some mind-blowing books. Does that sound wasteful? Does that sound inefficient? Nostalgic? Out-of-sync with the times? Damn right it does. But if we don't want young people of all backgrounds to experiment with ideas and identities because it seems too expensive to support, we have to ask ourselves what sort of society we are trying to become. Higher education is not one system. There are multiple layers and a wide variety of institutions. But they all have one thing in common: They have a mission to use knowledge to empower people to imagine a better life and transform society. If we like where we are, let's just forget about it and roll back public support for higher education. But if we aspire to better things as a society, not just as individuals, then we should rediscover the vision of public higher education that inspired the University of Virginia in the first place. Unlike Harvard and Yale, UVA is not named for a person. Thomas Jefferson named The University of Virginia for a commonwealth instead of himself because it belongs to and serves the greater good of a commonwealth.

17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/06/ed_crane_leaves_cato_in_a_settlement_to_end_the_think_tank_s_hostile_takeover_by_the_koch_brothers_.html	"Shortly before 3 p.m. today, the men and women of the Cato Institute strolled into the renovated Friedrich von Hayek Auditorium to confirm their good news. Five days earlier, the Washington Post broke news of a settlement between David Koch, Charles Koch, and America's largest, longest-lived libertarian think tank. Ed Crane, 68, Cato's president since its 1977 genesis in San Francisco, would step down. His replacement would be John Allison, 64, a banker who'd endowed college courses on the work of Ayn Rand. Bob Levy, chairman of the Cato board, took the stage first and explained the deal--a new board of directors (minus Crane and Charles Koch) and the end of the ""shareholder"" system that started the whole conflict. The avuncular Crane spoke next, introducing the staff to Allison. After meeting the new boss, the Cato-ites got to field questions about a treaty that had been hashed out over two months--from two in-person meetings in the Kochs' home base of Wichita, Kan., to some increasingly fruitful conference calls, all apparently moderated by Allison. There would be 16 board members, 11 of them unaffiliated with the Kochs. ""I didn't see today as Ed's swan song,"" says Levy. ""He's going to stay on for a while as CEO, and after that, he's going to remain a very important consultant on fundraising and other issues."" What about all of that public Jell-O wrestling with two of the planet's richest men? ""We've gotten past that."" David Koch had stopped donating to Cato, but ""if everybody behaves in a way that was contemplated, he'll be a supporter in the future as he was in the past."" Three months ago, Crane told me that he was ready to leave his empire--""I'll step down if it ends this thing""--if the warring families agreed to two conditions. ""We end the shareholder agreement, and we have a majority on the board of directors who are not part of the Koch group."" That's exactly what he got. If it's a win for Cato's current team, it's also a story about how the Koch family's new, 'roided-up political activism has divided the small world of professional libertarians. (Disclosure: I worked at Reason magazine, which got Koch funding, for two-and-a-half years.) The great war for Cato had lasted just nine months. It started on Oct. 26, 2011, with the death of William Niskanen. He'd joined the think tank 26 years earlier, after stints in the Ford and the Reagan administrations. Crane's Cato was on an endless quest to make libertarians respectable--suits and ties 'round the clock--and Niskanen helped. He got four of the 16 total shares in Cato, putting him on the same footing as Crane, Charles Koch, and George Pearson, Charles' political consigliere. The Cato shareholder agreement was succinct. ""Cease to be a shareholder,"" and the shares were up for grabs. Niskanen's widow tried to claim ownership. The Kochs didn't buy it. They proposed a new crop of board members, with closer ties to their interests. Later in 2011 they met with Bob Levy, the chairman of Cato's board, and described a think tank that could (in Levy's words) ""provide intellectual ammunition that we can then use at Americans for Prosperity and our allied organizations."" And they wanted Ed Crane out. Levy and Crane were effectively done talking about this. On Feb. 24, 2012, David and Charles Koch sent an email to Cato board members acknowledging some backbiting and suggesting that ""this dispute be tabled until 2013""--and that, by the way, they were right. Levy hit reply-all on a point-by-point demolition of their arguments. ""One way of avoiding so-called disparaging remarks,"" wrote Levy, ""is to stop doing damaging things such as attempting to pack the Cato board with Koch-affiliated directors."" Five days later, the Kochs filed suit in Kansas, asking for control of the Niskanen shares. The next four months were spent on slow-motion press leaks, lengthy emails, and public negotiation about what would be best for libertarians. You could sum up the Cato case with two bullet points. One: The Kochs wanted to hollow out a think tank and turn it into a political hack shop. Two: Nobody in the media would take the Koch-ified Cato seriously ever again. ""Who the hell is going to take a think tank seriously that's controlled by billionaire oil guys?"" asked Crane. Pro-Koch libertarians looked at this and saw a sell-out, pandering to the worst kinds of vindictive liberals. The Kochs' organizations put out their own spin at the optimistically named ForABetterCato.com, but the high-grade anti-Crane oppo appeared at Breitbart.com. In March and April, the site published a three-part investigation titled ""The Crane Chronicles,"" a greatest hits of libertarian gossip. Who did conservatives really want to side with? The Kochs, captains of industry, or the guy who'd become a source for Jane Mayer? The Tea Party funders who were under attack by Rachel Maddow, or the guy who screamed and raved at the Koch's board appointees? The series ended with anonymous (and unspecific) allegations about Crane's ""dismissive and degrading attitude toward women,"" a perennial happy hour topic for D.C. libertarians, not something the community wanted to air out in public. But the chatter stopped in May. That was when Allison et al started crafting their compromise. The Kochs had a strong case about those shares, and they could afford the legal bills. If they lost--and the Cato-ites I talked to certainly think that's the case--it had a lot to do with their new infamy as the people pooling donations for the defeat of Barack Obama. Maybe it was better for them to keep up ties to helpful libertarian organizations but not dominate them--not paint targets on them for future Jane Mayers to jab their pencils into. There's a passage in Charles Koch's management book, The Science of Success, that might explain the apparent cave. ""Each vindictive triumph,"" wrote Koch, ""adds to feelings of grandeur and the compulsion to destroy anyone who challenges this warped self-image. The elation does not last, so the quest for revenge is renewed and carried out with utter disregard for truth and the person's own best interests."" Ed Crane had read The Science of Success at least once. ""In my mind,"" he told me in March, ""it's one of the worst books ever written."""	Why the Koch Brothers Failed To Take Over Cato
18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/06/mitt_romney_wants_to_keep_his_mormon_faith_out_of_the_political_conversation_.html	"Mitt Romney is coy about his running mate. He'll only speak about the topic in the broadest terms. His staff won't talk about it at all. To be fair, they don't know much about the subject. It's something very personal to Romney. I am talking about his religion. This is the high season of speculation about Mitt Romney's vice presidential pick (Rubio's not being vetted!), but the other issue they keep locked up in Romney's Boston headquarters is far more likely to affect his presidency than who his No. 2 will be. It's obvious why Romney wants to control the coverage of both issues. He wants to announce his vice presidential pick on his terms for maximum political benefit. With his religion, he wants to control the conversation to limit the political downside. It is a truism of the vice presidential selection process that the people who talk don't know, and the people who know, don't talk. That's not the same with religion. Fellow Mormons know what it's like to be as devout as Romney and what that would mean for his presidency. They write op-eds in the newspaper; they have blogs. Two leaders in the church spoke on Monday at the Faith Angle Forum on Mormonism in Washington, D.C. and it was clear that they think Romney's faith isn't something to hide, but is a selling point. By explaining his faith and his role in the church, Romney could show why he is not as walled off from regular people as President Obama claims. Describing how his religious values have shaped him would explain why he makes decisions with such rigor and is so restless in his pursuit of excellence. When Michael Otterson, the Managing Director of Public Affairs for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who participated in the forum, talked about the faith, he described a religion especially compatible with the office of the presidency. ""Mortal life is a test, a probationary period in eternal progression,"" he explained, which accounts for Mormons' relentless work ethic, deep ties to the community, and particularly rigorous decision making. Romney, as a devout and active member, has all of these qualities because, as Otterson says, ""a passive attitude of faith is no part of being a Latter-day Saint."" The Mormon faith, in this view, is not something that a President Romney would passively carry with him into office; it would be a central driver of his presidency. ""If you want to offer to America the full package of who he is, if you don't [talk about his religion], you lose a very important half of what's shaped his life,"" says Clayton Christensen, a professor at Harvard Business School and author of How Will You Measure Your Life? ""I don't think there's a whole lot for him to be ashamed of--as you dig deeper and deeper you'll be able to show exactly who he is."" Romney's faith would inform a Romney presidency in two important ways: his decision making process and his capacity to show empathy for those who don't share his immediate experience. Both men described Mormon prayer not as a reason-free appeal for the divine thumbs-up or thumbs-down, but a process that calls a person to a special kind of rigor and engagement with life's choices, before they ever seek God's guidance. New York Times reporter Jodi Kantor, who participated in the discussion and has written on Romney's religion, pointed to the passage in the Doctrine and Covenants that she said was cited repeatedly by Romney's friends when discussing his decision making process. Guidance from God won't come unless you think it through first: ""Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me. But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind."" The second aspect of Romney's faith that would inform his presidency is his time as a bishop in an LDS congregation in Massachusetts in the 1980s. In that role, the equivalent to a pastor, Romney counseled members of his ward about their most personal matters. ""The fact that Mitt was a Mormon bishop in a ward that had one of every conceivable type of human,"" says Christensen, who has also served as a bishop. ""He personally ... met with them in their home and just had a very deep sense of what was going on in that family. That is another really important attribute. He feels it, whereas other people voted for legislation that took money from these people to give to those people. That's not an understanding of humanity."" It is not surprising to hear adherents to a faith make a strong case for it, but it does highlight how far Mitt Romney has positioned himself from those with whom he shares this fundamental bond. Though these men think Romney's faith should be discussed, Romney does not want to discuss it. That is certainly the politically wise choice. Romney wants the conversation to be about President Obama's failures. Fascinating details about Romney's life and religion distract from that. A conversation about religion would almost certainly go horribly wrong: Romney would get stuck defending Mormon doctrine in a way a Catholic would never have to defend the worship of relics. When a New York Times columnist jokes about tenets of the Mormon faith in a way the paper would not likely tolerate were it about another religion, Romney is wise to decide the deck is stacked against him in the mainstream press. Even if Romney could find a sympathetic forum, he isn't a good storyteller. He lacks the narrative talents to tell the kinds of stories that Christensen would like him to tell about his time as a bishop. Those stories are complex and not all of them are favorable to Romney, who battled with feminists in Massachusetts and whose role as a church voice on issues of homosexuality, out of wedlock births, and a host of other social issues would put him in a thicket of nettlesome debates he doesn't want to have. A discussion of Mormonism would certainly be intellectually interesting and theologically useful. David Mason, a professor at Rhodes College and devout Mormon, argues that Mormonism is not the same as Christianity, which raises fascinating religious questions. But in politics, fascinating is usually synonymous with deadly. Christensen argues, for example, that the LDS church provides the best template for Christian living that exists. Discuss! No thanks, says Mitt Romney, who does not want to offend evangelical voters he'll need in battleground states like Iowa, Virginia, and North Carolina. But there's more to Romney's religion than the theological side. As Joanna Brooks, who writes frequently on Mormonism, argues so persuasively, ""It is important for readers to know that Romney developed his leadership style in a non-democratic, patriarchal, hierarchical church culture where he rarely encountered open challenge."" Romney has been a leader in several different arenas: in government, in business, in helping organize the Olympic Games, and in his church. The campaign asks us to examine and approve of three of those four areas--and then walls off discussion of Romney's religious leadership. Mitt Romney has no interest in being an ambassador for the Mormon church any more than Barack Obama wanted to have a protracted conversation about race in 2008. In that way, both men are alike. They have both designed their political lives in ways that hide core parts of their identity. Unlike with his vice presidential pick, Romney will not be getting more specific about his other running mate any time soon."	Would Romney's Mormonism Make Him a Good President?

It seemed almost foreordained that Richard Holbrooke would have a difficult, unhappy stint in the Obama administration. He had the wrong history, personality, and operating style to fit in with the Obama inner circle, much as Holbrooke struggled in his own fashion to do so. He was of the wrong generation, serving at the wrong time. Holbrooke was a living symbol of the foreign-policy establishment against which the Obama team had campaigned. He had been serving Democratic presidents since the 1960s. The Obamians saw themselves as insurgents; Holbrooke had always tied himself to power, to worldly, prosperous Democrats like Averell and Pamela Harriman, Clark Clifford and the Clintons.* Holbrooke would almost certainly have been secretary of state if Hillary Clinton had won the presidency. He might also have landed that job if Al Gore had won in 2000 or if John Kerry had beaten George Bush in 2004. After Obama appointed Clinton as secretary, she hoped to name Holbrooke her deputy, but Obama gave that job to Jim Steinberg, who had been a leading candidate for national security adviser. Instead, in 2009, eager to return to government, Holbrooke took the lesser job he was offered, as the president's special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, or ""Af-Pak,"" as he soon called it. He found himself, for the third time in his career, working within but not quite at the top of a Democratic administration, obliged to serve under those who seemed to know less history (and fewer powerful people) than he did. He was working for a secretary of state whom he had tutored in foreign policy and for a president who had been seven years old in 1968, when Holbrooke began working for Harriman at the Paris peace talks on Vietnam. The rationale for giving Holbrooke the ""Af-Pak"" job was that while his outsize personality might create problems in Washington, he was especially good at fixing specific, hands-on problems overseas. Together, the wars against the Taliban in Afghanistan and against al-Qaida in Pakistan were among the highest priorities for the new administration. The Af-Pak assignment was meant to be a follow-on to the work Holbrooke had done in the Balkans during the Clinton administration. There, Holbrooke had managed to push, shove, and cadge the leaders of Bosnia, Serbia, and Croatia into accepting the Dayton peace settlement. His aggressive operating style had served him well in dealing with Serbia's Slobodan Milosevic. a tough leader who needed to hear some blunt language and threats along with the standard diplomatic niceties. The problem was that Hamid Karzai, the president of Afghanistan, did not stand in the same position as Milosevic in the 1990s. The Serbian leader was an adversary; Karzai was a shaky ally. Holbrooke could threaten Milosevic that if he balked, he might confront awesome American military power (and, indeed, the United States and its NATO allies eventually did bomb Belgrade). Holbrooke couldn't similarly threaten Karzai with the bombing of Kabul. Ultimately, the Obama administration needed the help and cooperation of Karzai's government. The applicable historical precedent for dealing with Karzai wasn't Milosevic at all. Rather, the closer comparison was those leaders aligned with the United States in the Cold War who proved increasingly unpopular at home and obstreperous in dealing with Washington. Both Nguyen Van Thieu in South Vietnam and Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines fit this description well. * * * Holbrooke quickly ran into even more serious problems in Washington. In the fall of 2009, the underlying tension and mistrust between Holbrooke and the Obama White House boiled to the surface. The precipitating factor was a profile of Holbrooke in The New Yorker. Written by George Packer, the article was entitled ""The Last Mission."" It told the story of Holbrooke's career from his early days serving in the Vietnam War to his new job in the midst of the war in Afghanistan. There were reflections by Holbrooke on the lessons from Vietnam for Afghanistan, comparisons and contrasts between the two countries, and pictures of Holbrooke in both Vietnam and Afghanistan--all of them introduced by a glossy portrait photograph of Holbrooke, covering one and a third pages. Denis McDonough, the deputy national security adviser, who rarely said or did anything without the president's approval, summoned Holbrooke to the White House for a strained conversation. Holbrooke and McDonough were probably the two most press-conscious officials in the entire administration: Neither was modest about calling reporters to try to shape a story in advance or to complain about something after it appeared. But the similarities stopped there. Holbrooke called the press on matters involving himself or his own causes and issues; McDonough was a staff man who pushed, equally aggressively, on behalf of his boss Obama. At their meeting, McDonough dressed down Holbrooke, pointing his finger for emphasis. He told Holbrooke that the president was unhappy about the magazine article, which had drawn attention to Holbrooke, not the administration, and portrayed Afghanistan in a way that centered on Holbrooke's own story. The White House wanted to set the messages and images of the administration, and not have various individual actors send out a cacophony of ideas. * * * On Sunday, Dec. 5, 2010, Richard Holbrooke played tennis on Long Island with Bill Drozdiak, the president of the American Council on Germany, a former foreign correspondent who became friendly with Holbrooke when both were living in Europe. They played for about an hour. Drozdiak thought Holbrooke seemed unusually pale, pudgy and out of shape, as if he'd been working too hard. Afterward, they sat and talked. Holbrooke said he was in despair over his role in the administration. He simply could not establish a relationship with Obama, Holbrooke said. The president seemed remote and cold-blooded, at least in Holbrooke's presence. And, as if that weren't enough, Holbrooke's problem wasn't just with Obama: Holbrooke thought many in the White House were against him, especially McDonough, who had been with Obama since the earliest stages of his 2008 campaign. Still, Holbrooke hoped somehow to leverage his many connections into a wider role in the administration. He was an old friend of Tom Donilon, who had a few weeks earlier become Obama's national security adviser. Maybe things will improve, Holbrooke told Drozdiak. The following Friday, Holbrooke was at a meeting in Hillary Clinton's State Department office when he suddenly became flushed and stricken with pain. He was taken to the State Department medical office, but collapsed and went by ambulance to George Washington University Hospital. He died there three days later of a ruptured aorta. * * * Holbrooke's death represented, in many ways, a passing of the old guard in American foreign policy. He was the link to the Democratic Party of the Vietnam era. His ideas and career reflected the party's prolonged ambivalence about what to say and do in the aftermath of that disaster. In the 1970s, Holbrooke had been among the Democrats' intellectual leaders in trying to define America's role in the world after the elder statesmen from the Kennedy and Johnson administrations--the Rusks and McNamaras, Bundys and Rostows--had been discredited. On the one hand, Holbrooke could sound passionately liberal as he attacked the Republicans during general elections and the periods when the Democrats were out of office. He embraced important causes such as stopping the spread of AIDS. He thought of Vietnam as a terrible mistake, one the United States should never repeat. Yet within the Democratic Party and during Democratic primaries, Holbrooke was definitely not a man of the political left. He did not ally himself with antiwar movements or candidates, whether George McGovern in 1972 or Obama in 2008. A year after the end of the Vietnam War, he specifically denounced ""the guilt-ridden anguish of the left."" Instead, Holbrooke invariably placed himself close to the Democratic Party's center of gravity, alongside established forces and elites rather than insurgent movements. To a considerable extent, this reflected his ambition and his fascination with power, his perpetual urge to be on the inside, his sense that those in antiwar movements or insurgencies didn't know the way things really worked (and also didn't know the right people, the ones on his long contact list). Yet along with these personal factors, Holbrooke's determined centrism reflected a set of underlying beliefs. He was not opposed to the use of force, especially not for humanitarian purposes in places like Bosnia and Kosovo. He did not believe America was inherently malign. He argued repeatedly that the United States should continue to play a powerful role in the world. The great irony was that Barack Obama, the president with whom Holbrooke did not get along, eventually embraced many of these same centrist views himself. After he became president, Obama made clear through his actions that despite his opposition to the Iraq War, he was no pacifist. On the contrary, he was quite willing to wield military power (ground troops in Afghanistan, SEAL teams on killing missions in Pakistan) and technology (drones in country after country) on behalf of America's interests and values. If Holbrooke was respectful of money, comfortable with financial power and the world of Wall Street, Obama was hardly a populist on economic issues himself. In their beliefs, then, the two men turned out to be not too far apart. In their personalities, however, they were strikingly different. Holbrooke was aggressive, emotional, dramatic, persistent, preoccupied with the personal, and consumed with whatever was happening at that moment. Obama remained cool, restrained, impersonal, far less swept up in the news coverage of the day, more preoccupied with long-term strategy, more driven to challenge established political power.  * * * The memorial service for Holbrooke, held at the Kennedy Center, was a Washington event like few others. This was in some ways surprising. By way of comparison, three months later Holbrooke's former boss, Warren Christopher, died. During his Washington career, Christopher had held two jobs, secretary of state and deputy secretary, that Holbrooke, despite his aspirations, never reached. Christopher also ran the high-level negotiations that brought American hostages home from Iran in early 1981. Yet in the nation's capital, Christopher's death was a one-day story; no big memorial service commemorated his life. Holbrooke, by contrast, had the biggest, mostly highly attended Washington memorial service of any political or foreign-policy leader since the state funerals of Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford. Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari flew in from Pakistan for the ceremonies, along with other foreign-policy luminaries. President Obama spoke in Holbrooke's honor, and so did both Bill and Hillary Clinton. All of them praised Holbrooke, yet there was also a certain undertone to the proceedings, the legacy of his difficult time in the Obama administration. Holbrooke had been one of the stars of the Clinton administration; in the Obama administration, he was forced into the limited role of a character actor. To the Clintons and their associates, Holbrooke was Our Crowd; to the Obama administration he was Their Crowd. Bill Clinton gave a speech that was typically effusive (""I loved the guy. ... If you knew him, you had to love him""), but also pointed and obliquely political, with remarks that could have been aimed at Obama: Although Holbrooke had a few ""rough edges,"" the former president said, ""I could never understand people who didn't appreciate him."" (Left unsaid was that Bill Clinton himself had passed over Holbrooke for secretary of state at least twice in 1992 and 1996--three times, if one includes the time in 1994 that Clinton tried unsuccessfully to bring in Colin Powell as secretary of state.) Hillary Clinton, her face strikingly animated, both warm and sad, spoke of Holbrooke in personal terms, smiling at his foibles: ""He'd walk into meetings to which he was not invited, act like he was meant to be there, and just start talking."" When he did something no one else would do, she said, she and her associates would just say, ""That's Richard being Richard."" It was Obama who sought to put Holbrooke into a broader context, one that went beyond his personality. He depicted Holbrooke against the background of American foreign policy and the generational changes within it. ""In many ways, he was the leading light of a generation of American diplomats who came of age in Vietnam,"" said Obama. ""It was a generation that came to know both the tragic limits and awesome possibilities of American power--born at a time of triumph in World War II; steeped in the painful lessons of Southeast Asia; participants in the struggle that led ultimately to freedom's triumph during the Cold War."" In the days afterward, some of Holbrooke's friends and the Clinton crowd murmured privately that Obama had been off key, that he seemed too aloof in speaking about Holbrooke, that he had been graceful but a bit stinting with his praise. After a few more months, Holbrooke's friends and family became more public in criticizing the Obama White House. He ""was effectively gagged, unable to comment on what he saw as missteps of the Obama administration that he served,"" wrote Nicholas Kristof. Holbrooke had indeed been gagged, prevented from appearing on news shows or talking on the record to the news media--although had he been allowed to appear, he would almost certainly have publicly praised and defended the administration in which he served. From the perspective of the Obama White House, Holbrooke had been reined in because, merely by appearing regularly on the talk shows, he would have called attention to himself and assumed more power than the president and his aides were willing to hand over. They did not want Holbrooke to shape the stories that were written or told about the administration, the narratives that they wanted to control on their own. It turned out that the only drama in which Holbrooke had the lead role during the Obama administration was his own tragedy. Holbrooke's widow Kati Marton told the Kristof that Holbrooke had compared Afghanistan to Vietnam. ""He thought that this could become Obama's Vietnam,"" she said. ""Some of the conversations in the Situation Room reminded him of conversations in the Johnson White House. When he raised that, Obama didn't want to hear it."" He certainly didn't.

Every Republican official and piece of the GOP firmament issued a press release saying this proved the president was out of touch. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell asked if the president was living on another planet, Speaker John Boehner and Eric Cantor held a special press conference, Chris Christie was undone, and of course Mitt Romney had a say. GOP Archers for Less Regulation may have even sent out a Tweet. The political fallout was predictable in a campaign where each side rolls out emergency fainting couches and commits synchronized jaw-dropping at the latest perceived outrage. Barack Obama is never allowed to say the economy is ""doing just fine,"" just as sure as Mitt Romney is never allowed to say he's ""not concerned about the very poor."" Democrats clobbered Romney for his remark back in February. Now it was time for Republicans to make the president suffer. Some were even paying Obama back for his attacks on John McCain in the last campaign for a similar remark about the economy's fundamentals. (The RNC video making use of Obama's remark is almost identical to the 2008 Obama ad about McCain.). Will this election be a choice between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney or a referendum on Barack Obama's handing of the economy? President Obama would like it to be a choice, but he is stuck with the reality that it's likely to be a referendum. That is how he found himself in the position of saying what he did about the private sector--which is not without basis in fact.  He wanted to explain the current economic slowdown, where private sector employment has been improving while the public sector has been contracting, so that he could blame Republicans for not supporting his solutions. He also explained that if the economy gets worse it's Europe's fault. For Mitt Romney, the president's remarks no doubt seemed like a gift, but they also presented him with a choice over how to approach this election. In the wake of the Scott Walker victory in Wisconsin, conservatives from Charles Krauthammer to Bill Kristol to Walker himself have called on Romney to make the campaign about more than Obama's economic record. They would like him to make his campaign an affirmative case for conservative policies. Obama's Great Private Sector Is Fine Declaration of June 2012 is likely to hurt their argument and encourage Romney to continue along his cautious path. Why would Mitt Romney change course when the president is making these kinds of self-inflicted wounds? Political gifts like this will keep rolling in as the president tries to wriggle out of catching blame for the economy. Why say anything provocative that might take the focus away from the president? Also, the president's ""gaffe"" points out something Romney knows well: The modern campaign news cycle doesn't allow candidates to say complex or risky things. Bold policies--even boldy conservative policies--have to be explained; and explaining requires a sympathetic audience willing to at least consider the meaning of adjoining sentences, not merely judge you for what you say in a single sentence. The point of such a campaign, Romney's supporters rebut, is not simply to win the election but to have an election that is worth winning--to build a mandate for conservative government without which you'll never be able to govern as a conservative. Scott Walker, in addition to calling for more boldness from Romney, said a key lesson that he learned was that he needed to educate voters before going forward with big solutions. ""My problem was I was so eager to fix it I didn't talk about it. I just fixed it,"" Walker told Jonathan Karl of ABC News. ""We have learned from this. We are going to both talk about, get people engaged, work on solutions together and then fix it."" This, you may remember, is almost the exact sentiment that got Newt Gingrich into trouble when he claimed that Paul Ryan's Medicare proposal was ""right-wing social engineering."" Gingrich's point was that radical change requires educating and convincing voters. If Mitt Romney decides to stay on the cautious path--giving speeches about free enterprise and keeping the focus on President Obama--it may win him the election. Then he'll just have to figure out what to do with a country that has not been prepared for the kind of sweeping changes he plans to make. If he doesn't win, this will be the moment conservatives will remember. Romney will be the candidate who talked forcefully about creating an environment where businesses can take risks again--and never took one himself."	"Why Obama Can't Say the Economy Is ""Just Fine"""
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/06/will_mitt_romney_embrace_the_bold_conservatism_of_paul_ryan_and_scott_walker_.html	"Republican anti-tax activist Grover Norquist sees a Wisconsin business opportunity for Mitt Romney now that Governor Scott Walker has survived. Walker built a network of campaign offices across the state. Romney should mount a friendly takeover. ""The smart move for the Romney campaign would be to take over those same staff and don't let them shut down,"" says Norquist. ""In Wisconsin they have the best turnout operation in history. They've been exercising all year. They're excited and they're cheerful."" Can Mitt Romney compete in the battleground state of Wisconsin? The political calculus is complicated. Republicans may have built a state-of-the-art machine for identifying and persuading voters, and they've had chances to repeatedly test it, but no Republican presidential candidate has won in Wisconsin since 1984. Walker's campaign offices might work for Romney, but his voters won't necessarily transfer in the general election. Exit polls on Tuesday showed Obama beating Romney by 11 points (though the margin may be as much as half as big once absentee ballots are factored in). From an ideological perspective, though, Romney should rush to Wisconsin and plant the flag. It is the home of two GOP superstars--Scott Walker and House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan--known for their boldness and perseverance. Romney says that he will be just as bold. If he ran loud and proud in Wisconsin it would send a message that he's going to govern in the same audaciously conservative mold as the state's favorite young guns. It would also be totally out of character for a candidate as risk-averse as Romney. When you think of Romney, the expression ""loud and proud"" doesn't come to mind. Wisconsin isn't just any other battleground state, and Walker's victory wasn't just a victory for a person but for a GOP political philosophy of courageous conservatism. As Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell wrote on Twitter: ""Tonight, Wisconsin voters rewarded political courage."" Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana also chimed in immediately about Walker's victory: ""good policy is great politics."" Wisconsin's marquee politicians embody the key criteria required for heroism in Republican ranks these days: taking a bold stand and sticking to it no matter how strong the opposition. Chris Christie has a reputation for toughness in New Jersey, but Walker has faced the full force of organized labor and liberal outrage. Ryan has been the centerpiece of President Obama's attacks on Congressional Republicans more than arguably any other Republican in Washington. ""Reince [Priebus] talks about candidates who are true to their word and campaign on issues and govern as they campaigned,"" says RNC political director Rick Wiley, quoting his party chairman--who also happens to be from Wisconsin. ""Scott Walker and Paul Ryan are poster children for that."" Romney agrees with Walker and Ryan on the substance. The Wisconsin test is whether he will act like them. Will he try to finesse Republican ideas past voters with vague proclamations or campaign on them as Walker and Ryan have? This is also a test of the conservative agenda. If Romney chooses to run in the manner of Walker and Ryan, can he survive? Rush Limbaugh reports (!) that in private, Romney said he will be so bold it might make him a one-term president. But so far his campaign hasn't acted that valiantly. Mitch Daniels, the governor of Indiana who preaches a version of the Wisconsin doctrine, has argued that Romney needs to be clearer about what he's going to do if for no other reason than to build a mandate for his eventual actions. Daniels is pointing to the difference between winning an election based on being anti-Obama and winning an election based on ideas. Romney was timid about the Walker recall out of political necessity. (He didn't say a word after the GOP primary in April.) Just like President Obama, Romney didn't want to meddle in a local fight and risk having the outcome over which he has little control be seen as a vote about him. Neither campaign has advertised in the state. Now that Walker has won, will Romney embrace him? Bill Kristol argues that he should rush in for the belly-hug. Kristol writes that the campaign should ""associate Mitt Romney with Governor Walker's success--and the successes of other governors--in making the case for a national agenda of conservative reform of a bloated and bankrupt welfare state."" Indeed, immediately after the Walker victory, Romney called the new GOP hero and issued a tough-talking (for him) statement: ""Governor Walker has shown that citizens and taxpayers can fight back--and prevail--against the runaway government costs imposed by labor bosses. Tonight voters said 'no' to the tired, liberal ideas of yesterday, and 'yes' to fiscal responsibility and a new direction. I look forward to working with Governor Walker to help build a better, brighter future for all Americans."" Romney has already embraced the other Wisconsin GOP hero, Paul Ryan, and Ryan approved of Romney's Medicare reform proposal during the primaries. Romney campaigned with Ryan during his Wisconsin battle against Rick Santorum, and Tuesday Ryan held an event in North Carolina for Romney. This might have been a vice presidential try-out or it might just have been a way to use a party superstar to raise some dollars. But if the moral of the Wisconsin Republican story is that politicians who run with gusto on conservative ideas can win the day, then Romney needs to pick it up a notch. His embrace of the specifics of Ryan's plan has been spotty at best. When one of his advisers was asked about it this past Sunday, he said that Romney supported Ryan but had his own plan. True enough, but Romney's own plan is not nearly as robust and detailed as Ryan's blueprint. It is the expectation among Republicans like Norquist and in Congress that Romney's job as president will be to simply sign the Ryan budget. If that's true, and the Wisconsin lesson is that boldness pays off, then Romney should promise to sign it on his first day in office. That would be extraordinary, because the political risk calculation is more complicated than the hero storyline suggests. Walker's race was brutal and required a massive resource advantage. Ryan's budget plan, while not the liability Democrats initially predicted, is credited with helping Democrats win a Republican seat in New York's 26th district. No matter how exhilarating the Wisconsin narrative may be, Romney also knows details kill. And it's clear that President Obama is ready to pounce. He and Vice President Biden have been trying for months to wrap Romney in the Ryan plan. The sweet spot for Romney is to associate himself with the Ryan plan in general but never get pinned down on the specifics. In 2010, House Speaker John Boehner did not include the full Ryan plan in his pitch to voters called ""Pledge to America,"" because he knew that specificity would give Democrats something to attack. Ryan knows this, too. That's why Ryan talks about closing tax loopholes but doesn't pick which ones. (There are lists.) When Romney was overheard by reporters at a fundraiser mentioning a few of the puny tax loopholes he'd think about snipping, his campaign said he was merely repeating some ideas he'd heard. Romney is still making his transition from primary to general election candidate. The boldest thing he has done so far as Obama's opponent is visit an inner-city Philadelphia school. There he met with some resistance to his conservative ideas. Will he run on a bold set of ideas of the kind championed by the Wisconsin duo now that he is not trying to court GOP voters alone? It remains to be seen. If he does, he'll know the best state in which to make his stand."	Will Romney Embrace Wisconsin's Bold GOP Ideas?

That's what President Obama's top adviser David Axelrod faced at a Boston press conference this week. Mitt Romney staffers drove from their headquarters across town to shout him down. Something like this has been happening to the president this election. When he tries to explain why he should be re-elected, the economy opens its mouth and drowns him out. On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that only 69,000 jobs had been created in May, well shy of the roughly 140,000 required to sustain minimum economic health. The numbers for previous months were also revised downward, and the unemployment rate ticked up to 8.2 percent. Booooooooooo. If people lock in their feelings about the economy six months before an election, as so many political strategists say, then the president is in bad shape. We're five months away from Election Day. In some states like Ohio and Florida voting starts four months from now. Though there are some positive signs in the economy--consumer confidence was up last month, so was consumer spending, construction was up, and manufacturing continues to rise--there is no evidence that anything is going to happen that will be dramatic enough to break people out of their funk in which they think the country is heading in the wrong direction and they don't approve of the job the president has done handling economic issues. Since these latest warning signs come after a period of optimism, even if the economy does improve, voters might fear that the clouds will come back again. This is not all the president's woes, not by a longshot. The crisis over the euro is getting worse. American political types are paying attention to the recall election in Wisconsin next week, but the more salient one might be the June 17 election in Greece, which could set off another global economic panic. The European Central Bank president, distraught at trying to get 17 countries to act in concert, is sounding the alarm. A failure in Europe would further depress the U.S. economy by shrinking the customer base for American goods, spooking the stock market, and weakening U.S. banks tied to the global market. President Obama can't do much about the economy at this stage, a fact that only heightens people's frustration with his stewardship. (It must drive him nuts given how much control he has over drones and cyber war in Iran.) But the president and his team have been working to change the subject from a conversation about whether people are better off (which is a question all about his performance) into a question about whether they will be better off (which makes it a contest with Romney). When you have to change the question before you do the convincing, you're usually in a tough spot. You have to convince voters of two things instead of just one. Walter Mondale tried this ""are-to-will"" trick in 1984 against Ronald Reagan, and it didn't work. If Obama can change the question (big if), then he'll need to disqualify Romney as an economic steward of the future. The Obama campaign has been at this on two fronts, attacking Romney's time as CEO of Bain and his tenure as governor (that's what Axelrod was doing as he was getting booed in Boston). The first front took a friendly fire hit on Thursday night. Bill Clinton on CNN said Romney had a ""sterling"" business career.  ""I don't think we ought to get in a position where we say this is bad work,"" he said of Romney's tenure at Bain. ""This is good work."" Clinton went on to say that Romney's good work involved people losing their jobs and didn't necessarily prepare him for the presidency, but by implying that the Obama critique was wrong, the former Clinton at the very least muddied things. If Obama is going to disqualify Romney, he needs people to hear ""layoffs"" when they hear the word ""Bain,"" not hear the word ""sterling."" If you are an Obama supporter, you may be glum at this point. But all is not lost. There are at least three points Obama advisers would like you to cling to:"	Obama and the Jobs Report: The Unemployment Data is Dire for His Re-Election Campaign
23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/mitt_romney_winning_the_republican_presidential_nomination_was_always_the_conventional_wisdom_.html	"Yesterday Mitt Romney crossed the magic threshold of 1,144--the number of delegates he needs to win the GOP nomination. You didn't think you needed a yawn, but there ... I've given you a chance to open wide. This is a news-free event--we've known Romney has had it locked up for weeks--but there was a time when this was not considered such an eventuality. Not long ago, who would win the Republican nomination was a hotly contested question, an object of intense speculation, theorizing, and sharp retorts. But then everything fell into place. Let's take a moment to examine the pace of political change. We are entering a fallow political period. The Olympics are coming. Voters are tending to their summer plans. When they're not on vacation, they're outside, away from the stun of endless political ads and vacuous cable debate. Still, fevered political analysis and coverage will continue. (I will be making ample contributions.) Some stories will be incredibly important, some will be notable, and some will be frivolous. To offer some perspective, let's look ahead and behind. It has been 51 days since Rick Santorum dropped out of the race, rendering Romney's milestone in the Texas primary a nonstory. Fifty-one days before that event was Feb. 19. The story that dominated at the time was Romney's desperate fight for his political life. He had to beat a surging Rick Santorum in his home state of Michigan. Ohio looked to be up for grabs, and Romney, once heralded as a disciplined candidate with a well-oiled machine behind him, appeared plagued by missteps. (Remember Ford Field?) Newt Gingrich was plotting to convince delegates that he could pull off an upset in Tampa. (Gingrich was peddling the idea that he had a special relationship with the South.) Yesterday, Gingrich met with Romney in Las Vegas. The former speaker who railed against Romney for dishing ""pious baloney"" is now comparing Romney to Eisenhower. Oh, and let's not forget: brokered convention! Sure, some of these storylines were overblown by the press, hyped by Romney's opponents. But a lot of the near-death drama was deeply felt within the Romney campaign. Also, much of what happened that wasn't important to the outcome was still notable--it showed us what Romney was willing to do in a fight (rely on Donald Trump to make last-minute robocalls in Michigan, for example). The prolonged Republican primary season brought to the fore a challenge Romney still struggles with today: how to appeal to core Republican voters while expanding his lead beyond the older white voters that make up the party's base. The Republican primary was a lot like a Bond film: The outcome was predictable, but you could still have fun watching it happen. The truth of the GOP contest was that despite all the twists and turns, the conventional wisdom was always right: Romney had the organization, experience, and money to pull it off. (The Democratic primary in 2008, by contrast, did not end as the early conventional wisdom predicted.) Now we come to the general election, where a weak incumbent is dependent on an uncertain economic recovery to win the votes of an anxious and skeptical public over a challenger who is not well liked. That is the 2012 presidential contest in a sentence. The conventional wisdom now is that the election is going to be really close and centered around how people feel about the economy. Obama has a better organization and an electoral map with more routes to victory. Romney has the big benefit of a weak economy and an electorate unhappy with Obama's handling of the issue. Fifty-one days from now it will be July 25, still a month before the party conventions, and all of this will still be true. There may be occasional squalls--Contraception! Same sex marriage!--but the contours of this year's election story will be the same. If you're inclined to pay more attention to your backyard barbeque or the little league games, go ahead. During this period, what's dramatic today (Romney up by six in Florida!) is likely to change tomorrow (Obama up by four in Florida!). It's likely that most of the important and meaningful events of the summer will have as little chance of changing the conventional wisdom as many of those leading up to this once-important moment that passed yesterday without much fanfare."

Hence it's been news this week that he followed President Obama in endorsing same-sex marriage. But is Powell really a leader, much less one worthy of admiration? It's worth a glance back at his record in this election year as the nation discusses the attributes it seeks in a leader and contemplates what moral leadership really looks like. Speaking on CNN Wednesday, Powell said he has ""no problem"" with same-sex marriage. Before he could utter another sentence on that subject, though, he defensively and dishonestly shirked responsibility for his critical role in enshrining a ban on openly gay military service into law. ""It was the Congress that imposed 'don't ask, don't tell,' he said in response to Wolf Blitzer's questioning. Powell admitted it was his ""recommendation"" but passing the buck to Congress may be the dodge of the century. As the first African-American chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a hero of the first Iraq war, and the highest-ranking officer in the country, Powell commanded immense moral authority on this issue. Indeed his was doubtlessly the single most important voice in the painful debate, and the voice most pointed to by the Congress he's now trying to blame. While advocates of lifting the ban compared the gay ban to racial segregation in the military, Powell forcefully rejected the analogy, and his stature as a top African-American general put the issue to rest. Rear Adm. John Hutson, a high-ranking official who was part of the talks over whether to lift the gay ban, recalls that ""Powell put a hole in the analogy to racial integration, not particularly logically, but just by force of his personality and who he was."" Hutson said it allowed the rest of the military leadership to ""hide"" behind Powell. It allowed other champions of anti-gay discrimination to say, ""this isn't the same as racial integration.  This is different, and Gen. Powell says so."" Citing no evidence whatsoever, Powell insisted that letting gay people serve (not just openly gay people but any gay people--notwithstanding his simultaneous acknowledgement that they already did serve) would be ""prejudicial"" to ""privacy, good order, and discipline."" That rationale, notice, is not time-bound--if sharing quarters with people who might find you attractive violates privacy, it doesn't only do so if gays are unpopular, but does so always. It's not an argument that's subject to change as our culture changes, but an argument that's subject to change only when you admit you were wrong about it, which Powell has never done. Instead, he's been repudiating his role in creating ""don't ask, don't tell"" since, well, gay rights started to become popular--and safe, and this from someone who is not even in, or currently running for, office. It was widely reported that Powell ""changed his mind"" about the gay ban early in 2010, when such a reversal could have been helpful to the repeal effort. But the reporting was wrong. What he actually said was, ""If the chiefs and commanders are comfortable with moving to change the policy, then I support it."" That ""if"" was almost universally ignored but shouldn't have been, as it virtually negated his entire statement--the chiefs and commanders had not expressed their comfort at that point, and indeed some were about to become highly effective obstructionists by arguing the opposite, even suggesting that repeal could ""cost lives."" Far from leading, Powell was following, and worse: He was putting his imprimatur on the thinly veiled anti-gay sentiment that military members had always used to prop up an indefensible policy--exactly as he had done when the debate was swirling during the Clinton administration in 1993. When he did endorse ""reviewing"" (but not actually ending) the policy, he cited the increased ""acceptance of gays and lesbians in society,"" again hardly a model of moral leadership. It was neither the first nor the last time he'd do the popular thing over the right thing. After Operation Desert Storm in 1991, journalists learned that Powell had actually supported containment, not invasion but was perfectly willing to become a chief salesman for the war. In 2000, Vanity Fair's Christopher Hitchens accused Powell of two ""shameful cover-ups"" in failing to come forward with knowledge of atrocities in the Vietnam War and illegal arms deals to Iran in the Iran-contra affair. Powell, charged Hitchens, ""acted to gratify immediate superiors and to short-circuit any unpleasantness,"" placing the ""prestige of the military above any inconvenient ethical or legal concerns."" And after America's 2003 invasion of Iraq, Powell, as secretary of state, helped bolster a dishonest and ungrounded case for going to war, even though he later admitted he had strong private doubts. Now comes his marriage-equality endorsement--weeks after the president takes the plunge. And even these remarks are couched in queasy moralistic justifications: He cited gay friends in partnerships that ""are as stable a family as my family is, and they raise children. And so I don't see any reason not to say that they should be able to get married."" Does he have a different view for childless gays? He doesn't say. Either way, these are hardly the words of a courageous leader. I'm not slamming all leaders who await the political cover of others to do the right thing--this, indeed, was my hope for the aftermath of Obama's announcement, and sure enough, it's having an impact: Several major politicians and groups, including the NAACP, have now taken the leap, and polls show immediate growth in popular support for marriage equality. But I do seek to hold people accountable for what, in Powell's case, is a long track record of failing to lead. Obama's endorsement of marriage equality was deeply political. But it was also morally courageous, with the consequences to his political fortunes hard to pin down. If Colin Powell insists on posing as a leader while always following others, maybe he can adopt not just the position of President Obama but his principle as well."	Why Colin Powell Isn't Really a Leader
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/majority_minority_america_will_more_hispanics_and_asians_become_white_.html	"It's rare that a Census Bureau press release dominates the front pages, but last week's headline ""Most Children Younger Than 1 Are Minorities, Census Reports"" was the thrilling exception. The shortage of white Anglo babies, the press was eager to tell us, was a glimpse of things to come, of America's future as a majority-minority nation. I have my doubts. ""A minority,"" the census release clarified, ""is anyone who is not single-race white and not Hispanic."" It's not that the census is counting the wrong thing. Rather, I suspect an awful lot of these ""minority"" babies are going to be white when they grow up. When I filled out my 2010 census form I was, like many Americans with Spanish surnames, a bit puzzled. Prompted to ask if I am ""of Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin"" I said that I was. But it seems like a bit of a fraud. My grandfather is Jose Yglesias, and his parents immigrated to the United States from Cuba. He grew up speaking Spanish at home in the Spanish-dominant community of Ybor City in Tampa, Fla. His books are published (in English) by Arte Publico Press as part of their Pioneers of Modern U.S. Hispanic Literature series. It's right there on the cover. And I am, obviously, a descendant of my own grandfather. So if he's a pioneer of Hispanic literature, then clearly I am of Hispanic origin. Back in the real world, though, I'm just another white dude. My three other grandparents are all of Eastern European Jewish extraction. I grew up speaking English at home, though I once took a summer Spanish class at NYU. (One of grandpa's pioneering works of U.S. Hispanic Literature, Tristan and the Hispanics, is precisely on this theme of assimilation. Young Tristan Granados, a white English-dominant Yale student, needs to travel to Ybor City to deal with his late paternal grandfather's extended Cuban-American clan. He's part of the family, but not really part of the culture--a very common element of the experience of immigration and assimilation in the United States and other major immigrant centers.) As books like How The Irish Became White and How Jews Became White Folks: And What That Says About Race in America make clear, whiteness in America has always been a somewhat elastic concept. It's conceivable that 40 years from now nobody will care about race at all. But if they do still care, it will still be the case that--by definition--whiteness is the racial definition of the sociocultural majority. If the only way for that to happen is to recruit large swathes of the Hispanic and fractionally Asian population into whiteness, then surely it will happen. Indeed, while the Census Bureau has always been very clear that some people are white, others black, and yet others Native American or Indian, the federal government has frequently changed its mind about the rest. The first time an additional option showed up was in Census 1870's addition of a ""Chinese"" race. By 1890 you were also allowed to be ""Japanese,"" and ""mulatto,"" ""quadroon,"" and ""octoroon"" categories were implemented for the fractionally black. These mixed-race categories vanished in 1900, but mulatto returned in 1910, and in 1920 ""Hindu,"" ""Korean,"" and ""Filipino"" became races. Mulatto vanished in 1930, and ""Mexican"" became a race, though people of Mexican ancestry had been living in large parts of the United States since those parts of the country actually belonged to Mexico. In 1940, Mexicans were granted white status--a measure backed up by a 1943 Texas law passed in part as an act of wartime solidarity, in appreciation of Latin American support for the anti-Nazi cause. Hindu and Korean vanished in 1950, but Korean returned in 1970 along with an ""Other"" category. In 1980, ""Vietnamese,"" ""Asian Indian,"" and ""Guamanian"" became races, and the government started classifying people as Hispanic or not-Hispanic over and above their racial designation. Only in 1990 did the Census hit upon the idea of lumping a bunch of people together into a catchall ""Asian"" race. In 2000 they gave us the ""two or more races"" category. The point of this long-winded recitation is simply that with the important exception of the black/white dichotomy, America has never operated with a stable conception of race. The factoid that 50 percent of our latest baby crop is other than non-Hispanic white is true only relative to the 2000 census scheme. There's no reason to believe that this particular categorization will continue as bureaucratic practice or social reality. I recall a telling incident from several years ago when Ta-Nehisi Coates referred to half-Korean Yeah Yeah Yeahs singer Karen O as white, only to apologize for the error later. It's common for Hispanic actors to play presumptively Anglo characters, as in Cuban/Colombian Odette Annable's Dr. Jessica Adams, or Mexican-American Michelle Forbes' various characters on Homicide, Battlestar Galactica, and The Killing (she did have, admittedly, a memorable ""ethnic"" turn as a Bajoran on Star Trek: The Next Generation). A more telling statistic than the census's babies factoid was a February Pew report on interracial marriage, which revealed that 28 percent of Asians marry non-Asians and 26 percent of Hispanics marry non-Hispanics. This means that, yes, under the census formalism the number of two-or-more races people will surge. But it also reiterates the point that the boundaries between these categories are relatively fluid. If the government insists on rigidly applying the current scheme, complete with its odd one-drop-of-blood conception of Latino identity, then America will, indeed, become majority minority. But long-term stability has never been a hallmark of official government thinking on this subject. Everyone knows that a large share of the black population is in fact partially white, while a smaller--but not entirely trivial--share of the white population is partially black. The future of American whiteness will likely evolve to include a larger share of ancestry from Asia and Latin America, just as in the past it's expanded to include people from eastern and southern Europe. The idea that every single person with a single non-white ancestor counts as non-white will look as ridiculous as Elizabeth Warren's past claim of Cherokee identity."	I have one Cuban grandparent. Why does the census count me as Hispanic?

The mayor of Newark shovels walkways in heavy snowstorms. Recently, he rushed into a burning building to save a woman. Sunday night he was at it again, this time working fast to remove his foot from his mouth. On Sunday morning's Meet the Press, Booker described President Obama's recent campaigns ads attacking Mitt Romney as ""nauseating,"" comparing them to the foiled $10 million plan to remind voters that Obama was a longtime parishioner of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. Booker, who is considered a possible presidential prospect some day, had spent most of the show boasting about Obama's achievements. But when you undermine the central thrust of the president's attack strategy you must repair. By the end of the day, Booker had released a four-minute video trying to explain his comments. Mayor Booker was wrong on both counts. Bain is fair game, and there's no equivalence between the Obama campaign going after Romney's record at Bain and the proposed super-PAC-funded attack ads attempting to link Obama to his controversial former pastor. Booker's complaint was that the Obama campaign's ads distracted from the important issues facing voters and that its tone would sour people on the election. In general, it's a reasonable complaint; there's plenty in Obama's campaign that saps voters' hopes and distracts from core issues. But Booker picked the wrong target. Mitt Romney has argued repeatedly that his career at Bain--more so than almost anything else--gives him special insight into how to turn around the U.S. economy. It's well within bounds to put that career under a microscope to assess the truth of his claims. In campaigns, strategists try to make character assassination look like death by natural causes. Booker was clearly responding to the thrust of the Obama ad, not its specific claims. But Booker should know this is how you know an ad is working: It sends a message without leaving any fingerprints. In this ad, a fired steel worker uses the word vampire to describe Bain. That turns the closing of the steel company--something Romney would describe as a downside of the business cycle--into a symbol of Romney's relentless search to feed off the weak. That gut-level message is what also rankled Obama's former car czar, Steve Rattner, and former Democratic Rep. Harold Ford.* (The Romney campaign has turned the criticisms of Booker, Rattner, and Ford into a Web ad.) In a press conference Monday, President Obama said he was not attacking venture capitalists but Romney's specific stewardship. (Good thing, too, since venture capitalists whose companies sometimes fail donate to his campaign.) The president's position raises legitimate questions--all of which Romney has been mum about answering. Romney has asserted that business experience will make him particularly qualified to be president at this moment, but what does that mean? Does it mean he knows how to create jobs, which everyone seems to think is the signature issue of this election? That wasn't really Romney's precise job. His job was to maximize profits. He was very good at it. Bain even made money when companies collapsed and people lost their jobs, but his career shouldn't be defined by the things that went wrong any more than the president should be defined by the failure of Solyndra. Bain recently released a statement defending itself after the Obama campaign highlighted the losses at another plant once owned by the company: ""Despite political attacks that emphasize the few companies that have struggled, the facts are that during Bain Capital's ownership, revenues grew in 80 percent of the more than 350 companies in which we have invested."" Booker agreed: ""If you look at the totality of Bain's business, they've done a lot to grow business and support business."" But what about the job losses? According to the Wall Street Journal, 22 percent of the 77 companies the paper analyzed from Romney's tenure went bankrupt or closed their doors. Another 8 percent lost Bain money. How did Romney decide winners and losers? What does that tell us about how he'll make choices as president? If the market dictated the winners and losers, what should people conclude about the way government might change under his stewardship? If this unpleasant portion of his business experience isn't relevant to the skills he'll need as president, which skills are relevant? Where does he draw the line? You could argue that a person who has kept his eye on the ball (making profits) while remaining unsentimental about inevitable losses is just the kind of person you want at a time when hard choices must be made. Of course, Romney would never make this argument. It would be political suicide. His posture so far has been essentially pain free. He says hard choices must be made, but he gets nervous when articulating those choices. It stands to reason that anyone who has been in a senior executive post should have some skill making decisions, and that is the central attribute required of a president. But in business you don't have to deal with politicians as much as you do in the presidency, and you don't have to coddle interest groups nearly as much, either. The more relevant portion of Romney's career should perhaps be his tenure as governor of Massachusetts, where he tried to apply those business practices to government. His jobs record there is more lackluster than the success he had in private business, but there also aren't ready-made horror stories with sympathetic characters. Another reason voters should probably spend more time with Romney's Massachusetts record is to see how he handled politicians of the other party. He'll have to work with them in Washington, which is more polarized than ever. How would he do that? Two of the three promises he makes in his first general election ad--reforming health care and the tax code--will not pass without the help of Democrats. You might imagine Romney would welcome the chance to engage in this debate about his Bain career. Please: Ask me about this strength of mine. But Romney is reluctant for two reasons. He wants to keep the focus on President Obama's record, and he's not very good at talking about his business experience. He doesn't have the appealing anecdotes a successful small businessman would have. That became readily apparent in a conversation I had with two Ohio men who run their own businesses. They could easily drop stories about chats they'd had on the shop floor with their workers, the stress they'd felt worrying about bankruptcy, and the pride they took in never having laid off a worker. Romney is great at asserting but not very good at storytelling. He hopes that the assertion will be enough. Plus, a full and frank discussion about the trade-offs of capitalism is dangerous territory for a politician. During the 2008 Michigan Republican primary, when John McCain said a reality of the business cycle was that auto jobs were not likely to come back to the state, Mitt Romney clobbered him, even though he probably knew it was true. If Bain is fair game, is there something about the Obama ad that is out of bounds? The ad received a ""mostly true"" rating from PolitiFact, which, by the standards of campaign ads, is like a horror film getting a G rating. If your political ads are not getting denounced by the fact-checking organizations, you're doing something wrong. That doesn't mean it's entirely clean: Romney wasn't CEO when the steel plant closed. In fact, one managing director, Jonathan Lavine, was there at the time. He is a major Obama contributor. Other Obama campaign ads have gotten worse ratings for truthfulness. One ad attacking Romney ends by saying, ""It's just what you'd expect from a guy who had a Swiss bank account."" Making a candidate's personal decision stand in for a fundamental character flaw is a less substantive critique than the Bain attacks and more underhanded. That's why Booker was wrong about the Rev. Wright ads that died on the launch pad, which is an even more insidious version of the form. Above the sniping about the ad, this moment highlights the central issue of this campaign. The president argues that the government needs to play a better role creating opportunity for everyone. What Romney's business experience tells him is that slashing government and freeing the private sector are the best ways to create prosperity. He points to his career at Bain as proof of that. Cory Booker is wrong--this debate is relevant. It is a fight to define Mitt Romney, and it's a fight to define the election.

27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/greece_will_leave_the_eurozone_sooner_or_later_sooner_is_better_.html	"The Greek euro tragedy is reaching its final act: It is clear that either this year or next, Greece is highly likely to default on its debt and exit the eurozone. Postponing the exit until after the June election with a new government committed to a variant of the same failed policies (recessionary austerity and structural reforms) will not restore growth and competitiveness. Greece is stuck in a vicious cycle of insolvency, lost competitiveness, external deficits, and ever-deepening depression. The only way to stop it is to begin an orderly default and exit, coordinated and financed by the European Central Bank, the European Union, and the International Monetary Fund (the ""troika""), that minimizes collateral damage to Greece and the rest of the eurozone. Greece's recent financing package, overseen by the troika, gave the country much less debt relief than it needed. But, even with significantly more public-debt relief, Greece could not return to growth without rapidly restoring competitiveness. And, without a return to growth, its debt burden will remain unsustainable. But all of the options that might restore competitiveness require real currency depreciation. The first option, a sharp weakening of the euro, is unlikely, as Germany is strong and the ECB is not aggressively easing monetary policy. A rapid reduction in unit labor costs, through structural reforms that increased productivity growth in excess of wages, is just as unlikely. It took Germany 10 years to restore its competitiveness this way; Greece cannot remain in a depression for a decade. Likewise, a rapid deflation in prices and wages, known as an ""internal devaluation,"" would lead to five years of ever-deepening depression. If none of those three options is feasible, the only path left is to leave the eurozone. A return to a national currency and a sharp depreciation would quickly restore competitiveness and growth. Of course, the process would be traumatic, and not just for Greece. The most significant problem would be capital losses for core eurozone financial institutions. Overnight, the foreign euro liabilities of Greece's government, banks, and companies would surge. Yet these problems can be overcome. Argentina did so in 2001, when it ""peso-fied"" its dollar debts. The United States did something similar in 1933, when it depreciated the dollar by 69 percent and abandoned the gold standard. A similar ""drachma-tization"" of euro debts would be necessary and unavoidable. Losses that eurozone banks would suffer would be manageable if the banks were properly and aggressively recapitalized. Avoiding a post-exit implosion of the Greek banking system, however, might require temporary measures, such as bank holidays and capital controls, to prevent a disorderly run on deposits. The European Financial Stability Facility/European Stability Mechanism should carry out the necessary recapitalization of the Greek banks via direct capital injections. European taxpayers would effectively take over the Greek banking system, but this would be partial compensation for the losses imposed on creditors by drachma-tization. Greece would also have to restructure and reduce its public debt again. The troika's claims on Greece need not be reduced in face value, but their maturity would have to be lengthened by another decade, and the interest on it reduced. Further haircuts on private claims would also be needed, starting with a moratorium on interest payments. Some argue that Greece's real GDP would be much lower in an exit scenario than it would be during the hard slog of deflation. But that is logically flawed: Eeven with deflation, real purchasing power would fall, and the real value of debts would rise (debt deflation), as the real depreciation occurs. More importantly, the exit path would restore growth right away, via nominal and real depreciation, avoiding a decade-long depression. And trade losses imposed on the eurozone by the drachma depreciation would be modest, given that Greece accounts for only 2 percent of eurozone GDP. Reintroducing the drachma risks exchange-rate depreciation in excess of what is necessary to restore competitiveness, which would be inflationary and impose greater losses on drachmatized external debts. To minimize that risk, the troika reserves currently devoted to the Greek bailout should be used to limit exchange-rate overshooting; capital controls would help, too. Those who claim that contagion from a Greek exit would drag others into the crisis are also in denial. Other peripheral countries already have Greek-style problems of debt sustainability and eroded competitiveness. Portugal, for example, may eventually have to restructure its debt and exit the euro. Illiquid but potentially solvent economies, such as Italy and Spain, will need support from Europe regardless of whether Greece exits; indeed, without such liquidity support, a self-fulfilling run on Italian and Spanish public debt is likely. The substantial new official resources of the IMF and ESM--and ECB liquidity--could then be used to ring-fence these countries, and banks elsewhere in the eurozone's troubled periphery. Regardless of what Greece does, eurozone banks now need to be rapidly recapitalized, which requires a new EU-wide program of direct capital injections. The experience of Iceland and many emerging markets over the past 20 years shows that nominal depreciation and orderly restructuring and reduction of foreign debts can restore debt sustainability, competitiveness, and growth. As in these cases, the collateral damage to Greece of a euro exit will be significant, but it can be contained. Like a doomed marriage, it is better to have rules for the inevitable divorce that make separation less costly to both sides. Make no mistake: An orderly euro exit by Greece implies significant economic pain. But watching the slow, disorderly implosion of the Greek economy and society would be much worse.

We have teamed up with our friends at SurveyMonkey to bring you the first ever Slate/SurveyMonkey Political Survey. Each month between now and November, we will unveil an informal survey of people's attitudes toward the presidential candidates--and how they are shifting. We want to show, in real time, how public perceptions are forming and changing around some of the big issues shaping the political conversation. This collaboration is a survey of more than 1,000 registered voters across the country, drawn from SurveyMonkey's pool of more than 2 million survey respondents. (Conducted from May 8 to May 11, we received responses from 48 states, plus the District of Columbia. More than 60 percent of the participants were married, and the majority held full-time jobs across an array of fields. If you wanted to demographically pigeon-hole a likely survey taker, you'd probably end up with a college-educated Christian white male from California.) What it is not is a scientific poll with a rigorous margin for error. We are capturing a snapshot, not running a lab experiment. But let's move to the fun part. In these early days of the campaign season, forging a personal connection with voters is critical. Both camps are trying to present their candidate as someone who connects with voters, someone who is in touch with people's needs. Therefore, we wanted to ask survey participants who they would prefer--Obama or Romney--in basic everyday situations that demand a little bit of trust. We asked: ""If your car was broken down on the side of the road, which presidential candidate would you want to stop and help you change your tire? Nearly 45 percent of survey takers would welcome the sight of Obama if they got a flat tire. Only 23.9 percent would prefer to have Romney help them with a spare. We then asked:  ""If you were hiring one of the presidential candidates as a baby-sitter, who would you choose?"" Again, trust in POTUS was high. More than 46 percent would prefer to have Obama watch their kids while they caught dinner and a movie. Only 21.8 percent of respondents would opt for the former Massachusetts governor to handle the nightly bedtime routine. (It is also worth noting that nearly one-third of respondents (31.6 percent) don't want either candidate around their children.) Presumably, a candidate who is successful connecting with voters is also someone people wouldn't mind spending some time with. So, we asked: ""Which presidential candidate would you rather have over to dinner?"" Obama posted one of his highest numbers for this question, with a solid 52 percent of the vote. Romney is not nearly as desired a dinner guest, with just under 26 percent. Then again, incumbency probably helps with a question like this. Stories about the glory days at Bain Capital have a hard time competing with being the first African-American president. The distance between Obama and Romney shrinks when it comes to policy. While survey-takers said that they considered the president more honest than Romney on a range of issues, the gulf was not as great as the earlier set of questions. In particular, they felt the president leveled with them on education and health care. Romney's best numbers came, not surprisingly, on the economy--a subject he has repeatedly hammered on the campaign trail. Still, if the election were held today, 45.2 percent of the respondents would vote for Obama to 38.1 percent for Romney. With these results in hand, it would appear that Obama is in a commanding position. He's the kind of guy you're thrilled to have over to the house, he seems handy enough to change a tire, and you would even let him watch your kids. Yet can he run the country? Our respondents aren't so sure. Esteem for the president's personal character doesn't necessarily spill over to a high estimation of his ability to govern. In our final question, readers were asked if they approved or disapproved of the way the president was handling his job. Check out the breakdown below: A plurality, a sizeable 29.6 percent ""disapprove a great deal"" with the job Obama is doing. If you add those who disapprove of his performance somewhat, the percentage of respondents who are unsatisfied with the president climbs to 48.8 percent. This despite the fact that nearly half (45.2 percent) of the survey takers claimed they would elect Obama over Romney tomorrow. If our unscientific study contains a glimmer of the general population's mood, many Americans could be planning to vote for Obama not so much to endorse his first four years but because they prefer it to the  prospect of a Romney White House. As John Dickerson observed last month, the president's campaign would like this election to boil down to a choice between Romney and Obama. If it does, they think the president will do well. Meanwhile, Team Romney wants to cast the race as a referendum on Obama's performance. If they succeed, then no one will care how good Romney is with a jack and a spare."

29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/in_maryland_gay_marriage_foes_are_pinning_their_hopes_on_black_voters_.html	"BALTIMORE--Leslie Lopes-Ruffin turned on the projector and pointed it high on the classroom wall. ""We pointed it at a sheet last time,"" she explained, ""and people couldn't see it."" The slideshow began, right next to a poster of President Obama, listing his accomplishments and famous quotes. There's not a liberal America and a conservative America--there's the United States of America. Ruffin started clicking through her slides, and trained us--myself and a local minister, Monte Harris, Sr.--on how to overturn Maryland's nascent gay marriage law. The governor signed it into law in March, but implementation was delayed until 2013, to give its enemies time to try and stop it. Rising Sun First Baptist Church is one of the full-time petition drop-off and training centers for the activists who want to put the law on the November ballot, and give voters a chance to overturn it. The success of the repeal campaign will depend on black voters. This isn't a secret. Proponents prefer not to talk about it. In March, an anonymous leaker published internal memos from the National Organization for Marriage that revealed a blunt, successful plan to ""drive a wedge between gays and blacks."" Black support for California's gay marriage ban was at least 58 percent, maybe as high as 70 percent. It was called the ""Not a Civil Rights"" project: Giving the traditional marriage fight an African-American face. If this can still work, it will work in Maryland. Petitioners have until June 30 to hand in 57,000 signatures to put marriage on the November ballot. Getting enough signatures won't be hard. But, once they do, they'll have to win in a state that gave the 2008 Obama ticket 62 percent of the vote. Black voters made up 25 percent of the electorate that year. They were told, by Obama, that he believed ""marriage is between a man and a woman."" Now he's telling them something different. It's a little awkward. Monte Harris, my fellow trainee, works at two AME Zionist churches in the Baltimore suburbs. ""I've been battling this Obama thing on Facebook,"" he said. ""They say, 'the Bible doesn't say anything about homosexuality!' And I type back to them, 'What Bible are you reading? The Rick James Bible?' "" The president's live TV ""evolution"" was a massive disappointment for Harris. Just one reason: Obama had cited the ""golden rule"" to explain himself. ""They always want to throw that out,"" said Harris. ""They take it out of context. They'll say, 'the Bible says 'love thy neighbor.' Well, the Bible doesn't say 'make love to thy neighbor.' "" I visited Rising Sun on Tuesday, when relatively few people were picking up and delivering petitions. A few hours before the training session, I met one of the volunteers who'd gotten his circulator stripes a month earlier--Melvin Bilal, a University of Pennsylvania-educated lawyer and practicing Muslim. ""I was at work,"" recalled Bilal, ""and one of my friends asked me, 'You see what your boy Obama did?' I felt, immediately, like the decision was political. It made him look like a hypocrite."" Some of the gay marriage skeptics I talked to were sticking with Obama. Bilal isn't. ""It's impossible for someone to be a serious Christian and not support what God said,"" he said. ""This goes to the heart of creation, of man. I went door to door for him last time. I won't vote for him this time, because of this. I'm going to look more closely at Romney. Romney's family, his father, come out of that Rockefeller Republican tradition."" In the meantime, he'd collect signatures--the big haul would come up at the end of the month, when he took petitions to Baltimore's Muslim Fun Day. Bilal is the kind of voter the religious right would clone en masse--if they believed in human cloning. On Monday, the Washington Post's new national poll found a mammoth swing in black support for gay marriage. Pre-Obama, in November, 58 percent of African Americans called it ""unacceptable."" Post-Obama, the number fell to 37 percent. But just transpose those numbers to Maryland. Ninety-four percent of African Americans went for Obama-Biden in 2008. There's a gulf here, black voters are picking their sides on the issue, and gay marriage foes are figuring out how to use it. The tactics change from state to state, demographic to demographic. Last week, in New York, gay marriage foes successfully hounded State Sen. James Alesi into temporary retirement. (""I'm not dead yet,"" he says.) He'd provided one of the four Republican votes for the state's gay marriage law. He started stumping at Republican and Conservative Party events again. The support had dried up, completely, as it had for another one of his colleagues two months earlier. ""At the end of the day I did not want to be a Republican candidate that voted for marriage and lost,"" he says. ""I wanted to be a Republican who voted for marriage and won. I probably could have won the general election, but I couldn't get on the ballot. And even if I had, it would have handed the marriage equality people a loss in a Republican primary."" There's a ratchet effect here--it gets harder every year to hold back the advocates of   gay marriage. Four years ago, social conservatives didn't have to worry about Republicans getting behind same-sex unions. Now, they have to primary them when they stray. Has Barack Obama moved the needle with black voters? Maybe. Maryland is where they will figure it out. Before I got back to the church in Baltimore, I toured more of the sites where the Maryland Marriage Alliance--tied loosely to NOM--was getting its numbers. In Bel Air, three volunteers--two white, one black--parked outside a Maryland Vehicle Association office with plastic tubs full of petitions. Paul Feryus did most of the talking, boiling down the legalese about HB438 and ""petitioning to refer the bill"" into a short pitch. ""Have you seen the petition on marriage and Maryland families?"" he asked. I stuck around for 45 minutes. The first 30 were slow. This was Harford County, Baltimore exurbs that gave John McCain 58 percent of the vote. They'd been asked to collect a few thousand signatures, and try to get them in by May 31. They were 75 percent or so of the way there, despite the stream of younger motorists walking by and declining to sign. ""You can see whether folks are interested or not pretty quickly,"" said Feryus, as a shaggy-haired kid with a Phish shirt glowered and ignored the petition table. Things soon picked up, but the signatories were all white. ""I'm out of state as of yesterday,"" said a middle-aged voter. ""I'm still registered here, though."" Feryus assured him he could sign. One voter scribbled down his information and asked what else they had. ""Anti-tax? Anything? Anything you've got against Marty [Martin O'Malley, the Democratic governor]."" That's part of the anti-gay marriage coalition. I met the rest of it at Rising Sun First Baptist. On the way to the training room, I passed two paintings of an African Jesus Christ, and a choir room where the icebreaker conversation was all about (gay?) marriage. (""CNN tried to talk to me,"" grumbled one parishioner.) Before the meeting, we had a visitor: Pastor and State Del. Emmett C. Burns, one of the most outspoken advocates of the referendum. Once he left, Lopes-Ruffin walked us through an hour of petition do's and don'ts, sharing the goals of the drive. They needed 57,000 signatures, but they wanted to hand in 150,000 as a show of strength--and they had 33,000 so far. They wanted 1,000 organizations, of all different faiths, to organize against it. They were shooting for 42 organizations, at least, in every county. Many would be centered around churches. The presentation ended with an inspirational image, a sun-bleached highway heading somewhere pleasant. ""This is only the first step,"" said our trainer. ""In November, we've got to get the souls to the polls!"""	Why the Anti-Gay Marriage Movement Is Counting on Black Voters
