That kind of budget, Nicholas Confessore wrote, ""would allow their political organization to operate at the same financial scale as the Democratic and Republican Parties."" This week, a little more than a year after the Kochs seemed poised to dump a cool billion onto the political money pile, my National Review colleagues Tim Alberta and Eliana Johnson reported that the brothers are ""reevaluating their approach to politics."" Alberta and Johnson's sources say that there is ""mounting evidence--reduced budgets, the shuttering and streamlining of departments, the elimination of grants to allied political organizations, and the departure of top executives--demonstrating a shift of resources and attention away from federal campaign activity."" What happened? Among other things, Donald Trump happened. If the Kochs are the poster children for the supposedly corrupting role of money in politics in a post-Citizens United world, Trump demonstrates that money isn't everything. Running on a shoestring budget, he vanquished Koch-friendly candidates like Scott Walker, Jeb Bush, and Marco Rubio by railing against immigration, free trade, and pretty much everything else the Kochs hold dear. To two brothers who think long and hard about the effectiveness of every dollar they spend, spending money on electoral politics is no longer looking like such a great investment. To understand the Kochs, you first need to understand that they take their libertarian ideals seriously. For years, the Kochs have been vilified by the likes of Harry Reid and Bernie Sanders for their political activism. They've been caricatured as mustache-twirling right-wing villains who buy and sell politicians to defend their ill-gotten gains from taxes and regulation. The truth is that the Kochs are actually far more ambitious than that. Instead of shaping the outcome of this or that political race, they've sought to amplify the voices of activists and intellectuals who share their suspicion of government power. Since the 1970s, Charles and David Koch have spent untold millions on a sprawling network of think tanks, magazines, and advocacy groups devoted to ending the drug war, shrinking the military, opening borders to immigration and trade, rolling back regulations, and cutting government spending. Dubbed the ""Kochtopus"" by its critics, this network has long engaged in intellectual combat with the left. Yet it has also done battle with rival elements on the right, from pro-war defense hawks to immigration restrictionists to opponents of drug legalization. For now, and for the foreseeable future, the GOP doesn't appear all that hospitable to libertarian ideals, so it should come as no surprise that the Kochs have decided to cut their losses. Over the years, the Kochs have gone back and forth between getting directly involved in campaigns and retreating into the world of think tanks and advocacy. In 1980, David Koch ran as the vice-presidential candidate of the fledgling Libertarian Party alongside Ed Clark, a Harvard-trained lawyer who hoped to soften some of the movement's rougher edges. The Clark-Koch ticket ran on a platform of ""low-tax liberalism,"" railing against the evils of Cold War militarism and drug prohibition while also making a pitch for greater economic freedom. Though Clark and Koch won a respectable 1 percent of the vote, the Koch brothers couldn't help but think that the campaign had proven a waste of money. Chastened by the experience, they returned to the project of building a libertarian infrastructure that might one day help achieve policy change. Decades later, the Kochs once again decided to enter the political fray. George W. Bush was presiding over an Iraq War that Koch-backed groups like the Cato Institute had warned would be an expensive folly. The Bush administration had also implemented programs like Medicare Part D and a temporary tariff on steel imports that were an affront to small-government orthodoxy. Sensing an opportunity, the Kochs stepped up their political organizing. Americans for Prosperity, the Kochs' chief political advocacy group, had spent years trying, and mostly failing, to translate free-market ideas into policy proposals that could resonate with voters. But then came the financial crisis and, soon after, the Obama presidency. President Obama's fiscal stimulus and the Affordable Care Act gave conservative activists focal points for their outrage, and Americans for Prosperity helped organize Taxpayer Tea Party rallies across the country. The Tea Party movement appeared to be exactly what the Kochs had always dreamed of: a libertarian mass movement that was capable of taking over one of America's two major political parties. At that early stage, at least, the Tea Party didn't appear to be overly concerned with social issues like abortion and same-sex marriage, nor did it talk all that much about immigration. Tea Party leaders were focused on a government that had in their view grown too large and too powerful and that was busy lining the pockets of Wall Street insiders. It soon became clear that the Tea Party was not the libertarian mass movement the Kochs and their allies imagined it to be. The opposition of older conservatives to Obamacare was motivated less by a generalized distrust of government than by a fear that it would shift government resources from deserving people like them to the undeserving poor. Moreover, Tea Party conservatives were in many cases more socially conservative than mainstream Republicans. As the Obamacare debate faded from the scene, grass-roots conservatives found themselves energized by other issues, including opposition to the Gang of Eight's efforts to push comprehensive immigration reform, legislation the Kochs were strongly inclined to support. The Kochs had hoped that the Republican Party of the future would be led by people like Scott Walker, the Wisconsin governor who managed to get blue-collar conservatives in his home state excited about rolling back collective bargaining rights for government workers. Instead, the party turned to Trump, an anti-immigration hardliner who maintains that there is absolutely no need to reform Social Security and Medicare and who hardly ever complains about the size of government. The Tea Party voters nurtured by the Koch network have been at least as energized by Trump's calls for building a wall along America's southern border as they were by the fight against Obamacare. What's next for the Kochs? Alberta and Johnson write that they ""had always believed that building the intellectual foundation for libertarian ideas in think tanks and universities--and supporting important public-policy initiatives at the state and local levels--paid greater long-term dividends than spending on elections."" My guess is that the brothers and their allies plan to go back to the drawing board, to find new ways to win Americans over to libertarianism. If there's one thing we've learned about the Kochs, it's that they're very, very patient."	"The Koch Brothers Were Supposed to Buy the 2016 Election. What Happened?

As she shouldn't be, because--barring some decision by federal authorities to render her to Guantanamo Bay or some Eastern European black site for maintaining a private email address--she isn't going to lose. But that doesn't mean there's nothing to worry about. For a primary race that's already wrapped up, Clinton sure has been having trouble wrapping it up. She's lost the past two nominating contests in Indiana and West Virginia. Even though she invested few resources into those states--in West Virginia, pretty much nothing--her losses there have caused some consternation among Democratic leaders, who see the Republicans transitioning to general-election mode before they are. And with each additional Sanders win comes renewed hope among Sanders supporters to match with inflamed frustration from Clinton supporters. As such, the atmosphere surrounding the late-stage Democratic contest has been getting frisky, with one state-party chairperson getting death threats apparently from Sanders die-hards and one celebrity Clinton supporter getting into a hotel fight with Sanders supporters. Hillary Clinton doesn't need this. The Democratic Party doesn't need this. What does Hillary Clinton need? A win in Kentucky wouldn't hurt. The Clinton campaign's recent expenditure patterns suggest that they've arrived at the same conclusion. Though the campaign spent no ad money in West Virginia, it has outspent Sanders in Kentucky and put 11 campaign stops into the state. (Clinton has essentially ceded Oregon, Tuesday night's other contest, to Sanders, even though the one recent poll of that state shows Clinton with a large lead. Because how does that poll even make sense? Oregon. Portland. Bernie Sanders. C'mon.) Although Kentucky bears some demographic similarities to neighboring West Virginia, its Democratic primary is closed to the independents who helped push Sanders over the top last week, and black voters, though still relatively sparse, make up a larger share of the electorate. Clinton's activity in Kentucky has created the sort of stakes that went missing from the Indiana and West Virginia contests. We're not talking about delegates here. There are 55 pledged delegates at stake in Kentucky, but proportional allocation ensures that no outcome short of, say, a two-thirds blowout from Sanders will make much of a dent in Clinton's overall lead of 273 pledged delegates. The stakes are Clinton's control of the Democratic electorate. If Clinton gave Kentucky everything she had and still lost, it would stand as Sanders' marquee win in the month of May and offer him more leverage in negotiating the terms of his exit from the race. The more Clinton loses in back-end contests of the race, the more compelled she is to negotiate with Sanders for his support. Clinton allies will control majorities of the Rules and Platform Committees at the Democratic National Convention. If they wanted to, they could take a hard line and shoot down pretty much anything Sanders desired. The cost of such a hard line, however, is a lack of support from Sanders and his supporters heading into the general election. And Clinton is going to need Sanders' supporters in November. For anyone who thought she could beat Donald Trump in a walk, new polling that shows the Republican Party (if not all of its leaders) consolidating around its presumptive nominee should put to bed any thoughts of an autumn coronation. Unlike Clinton in 2008, Sanders is not a loyal party figure with aspirations for higher office in the future, so he's unlikely to just close up shop after the cessation of primaries on June 7 and clasp hands with the figure who bested him. His legacy, as he sees it, will be determined by his ability to change Democratic Party policies and future nominating rules via the leverage he's accumulated over the past year and change. This infuriates the Clinton campaign and Democratic leaders itching to get on with the general election, and understandably so. But it's just something they have to manage. The easiest way for them to manage it would be to defeat Sanders Tuesday night in Kentucky and in most of the June 7 contests to demonstrate that Democratic voters, too, are eager to get on with the general election. If the Clinton campaign stumbles into the nomination with a slew of losses, Sanders is going to hold a harder line, with a stronger hand. The price of unity, in effect, will go up.

2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/why_hillary_won_t_blow_it.html	"In 2012, liberals worried that Barack Obama would fumble the election to Mitt Romney. ""With 100 days left in the presidential campaign, perhaps the two most vexing questions in American politics are: How could President Obama possibly lose? And, how could he possibly win?"" wrote Democratic consultant Drew Westen in a column for the Washington Post. Rank-and-file Democrats echoed this anxiety. Time proved these fearful liberals wrong, but their initial worry made sense. For most of 2012, the economy teetered between sluggish recovery and renewed slowdown; Obama's job approval was underwater, and white voters had turned decisively against his presidency. On the eve of the election, Mitt Romney held 59 percent support among whites, a margin on par with Ronald Reagan's in the 1984 presidential election. Even if relative conditions favored the incumbent president--and they did--it still felt as if Obama could lose, and lose badly. Four years later, Obama is a well-liked two-termer presiding over a decent economy. The Democratic Party is about to choose as his successor a woman who ran against him in 2008 and subsequently served in his administration as secretary of state. And in Monday's Washington Post, a headline read: ""The presidency is Hillary Clinton's to lose. Here are 12 ways she could lose it."" It's not unreasonable, as fears go. But they seem to proliferate even among liberals who understand that presidential elections are determined more by demography and economic movement--the fundamentals--than by the particular qualities of the candidates. That's silly. It's time people apply what they know to the shape of this election, rather than bend to what they might fear. Before that, however, it's worth looking at the reasons liberals are worried about this year's contest. In the Post, James Hohmann enumerates the problems with and surrounding Clinton. She's prone to unforced errors, like turning a routine line about the decline of coal in West Virginia into a soundbite promising an end to coal jobs. She's not a ""natural politician""--in her words--and she doesn't inspire in ways we expect our presidential hopefuls to inspire. She has a penchant for secrecy that doesn't serve her well, an ex-president husband who has hurt her campaign as much as he's helped it, and an ""insider"" pedigree that was as much a requirement--the first woman with a shot at the White House almost had to be an insider--as it is now an albatross, here in the present environment of reactionary populism and ""political revolution."" And, if that wasn't enough, she will be one of the most unpopular politicians ever to win a major party nomination. It doesn't ease the anxiety over Clinton's weakness as a candidate that Republicans, for their nominee, have chosen (or, less charitably, surrendered to) Donald Trump, a reality TV star and real estate mogul who soared to victory on nativist rhetoric and an expansive plan to deport unauthorized immigrants and ban Muslims from entering the United States. Trump emerged out of the dynamics and dysfunctions of the contemporary Republican Party, and eight months of polling presaged his victory. Still, he seems like an unpredictable force--a political Loki who bends and defies the ""rules"" of American politics. If the stakes of the 2012 election were high--the future of Democratic policymaking and the legacy of the nation's first black president--the stakes of this fight are mountainous. Who is this country for? Is it an experiment in multiracial, multiethnic inclusion? Or is it a herrenvolk democracy--a country for whites, and no one else? That the consequences of President Trump are so dire only amplifies the fear that Clinton could stumble and fall over her scattered baggage. It's too much to say that liberals and Democrats shouldn't worry. But to repeat a point that can't be repeated enough, the fact that Trump could win as a matter of mathematical reality doesn't mean that it's a likely outcome. We aren't in some chaos world of infinite possibilities. Presidential elections are still bound by structural forces, and those--not the dark arts of Donald Trump or the David Brentish awkwardness of Hillary Clinton--will weigh heaviest on this election. What are those forces? They are demographics. In 2012, President Obama won 39 percent of white voters to Mitt Romney's 59 percent, with major deficits in key swing states like Virginia and Florida, where he lost white voters 61 percent to 37 percent. And yet, Obama won the national popular vote with room to spare, and he won in those states. The reason is simple: nonwhite voters. By voting as a bloc (or close to it), black, Latino, and Asian Americans tilted the field decisively toward the Democrats. Thus far, there's no evidence these Americans have dropped out of the presidential electorate, and plenty to suggest they'll return in greater numbers. How does Trump fare with this rising share of voters? According to the latest survey from YouGov and the Economist, 82 percent of blacks and 78 percent of Latinos have a negative view of the Republican presidential nominee. Among people under 30, 80 percent have a negative view. Among women, 66 percent have a negative view. No one in the presidential field, including Clinton, is as unpopular as Trump is. He's in a whole realm to himself. There are still other forces. Take partisanship. It governs voting among most Americans, including independents, who vote consistently for one party or the other, even if they don't call themselves Democrats or Republicans. Partisanship is why Republicans have warmed to Trump in the days since he salted away the nomination. He's one of them now, and that's all that counts. On the same score, partisanship--helped along by party leaders like Barack Obama and Elizabeth Warren--is why most Democrats will eventually unite behind Clinton. Indeed, once we take partisanship seriously as a major force driving our electoral outcomes, the idea that Trump could peel off substantial numbers of Democratic-voting nonwhites or women (or even liberal whites) is ludicrous. It takes massive events--wars and recessions--to shatter long-established voting habits, and even then, the effect is modest. John McCain ran for president in the shadow of a failed Republican president and still won more than 45 percent of the popular vote. None of this is to say that Clinton can't lose. She certainly can. But the main effect of presidential campaigns is to turn candidates into generic party standard-bearers, which means modern presidential elections turn on macro events, not micro characteristics. Mitt Romney didn't lose 2012 because he was stiff and aloof; he lost because the economy was growing enough to favor the incumbent. Likewise, with or without Ross Perot in the running, Bill Clinton would have won in 1992--the economy was just that bad. There's no question that in the fall, this Clinton campaign will make cringeworthy moves to rival the embarrassing ones of the past year, from ""Yaaas, Hillary"" to ""7 things Hillary Clinton has in common with your abuela."" But gaffes don't make or break campaigns and bad merchandise doesn't move votes. In a world of $1 billion campaigns, hypertargeted messaging, and deep partisanship, they don't even matter. The obvious response to all of this is that Hillary Clinton is a distinctive character in American politics, sui generis in a way that prevents her from ever becoming a generic Democrat. That may be true. But if it's true of her, it's true of Trump, too. And while Clinton is distinctive in ways both good and bad--a former First Lady turned senator turned diplomat, an unpopular and divisive figure, the first woman with a serious shot at the presidency--Trump is distinctive in ways that Balkanize and alienate vast swaths of the electorate. Instead of panicking or worrying about Team Clinton's ability to avoid trivial mistakes, liberals and anyone invested in beating Trump should look for as many ways to capitalize on that fact. Which is to say, do not become addicted to the spectacle of Trump! It will take hold of you and lead you astray of the things that matter in this election. Politics is not just a game of personality--a contest of who can generate the most cash for cable networks. It is a struggle of values and interests, groups and communities. Far from worrying about Clinton, liberals and Democrats should understand that they have the advantage. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Why Hillary Won't Blow It
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/why_donald_trump_needs_paul_ryan.html	"On Thursday, Donald Trump came to Washington to make nice with Paul Ryan, speaker of the House of Representatives and de facto leader of the ""establishment"" Republican Party. The meeting, Ryan told reporters, went well. ""Donald Trump and I have had our differences--we talked about those differences today,"" he said, adding, ""I do believe that we are now planting the seeds to get ourselves unified."" Ryan followed this with an unconvincing riff on where he and Trump found common ground. ""We discussed the core principles that tie us all together, principles like the Constitution, the separation of powers. The fact that we have an executive that is going way beyond the boundaries of the Constitution. ... We talked about life, and how strongly we feel about this core principle."" It was at this point that anyone familiar with the broad contours of the Republican primary might have found himself or herself asking, What are these people even doing? Barring an absolute catastrophe in the fall, Paul Ryan will end this year in the speaker's seat, either shaping President Trump's agenda or leading the opposition to President Clinton's administration. Ryan doesn't need Trump, for anything. At the same time, the House speaker is a loyal Republican, and he knows that party unity is key if the GOP wants a clear shot in November. He's not wrong. At the risk of gross oversimplification, there are two reasons for the slim margins of modern-day presidential elections. The first is simple partisanship. There are more ""independent"" voters than ever, but the vast majority of them are reliable partisans--they vote like dedicated Republicans or Democrats, but they don't identify with the parties. If you judge by behavior and not identification, most voters are on one side or the other, and they don't switch over. The result is an electoral floor for presidential nominees. If you're a Democrat or a Republican in a general election, you can expect about 45 percent of the vote, as a matter of course. That covers Ryan. He's meeting with Trump, trying to build a partnership with the real estate mogul, in order to send signals to Republican voters. You can support this nominee, and you'll have to, if you want to beat Hillary Clinton. What about Trump? Why is he meeting with the Republican establishment he disdained during the primary? The answer is simple. He needs money. Specifically, about $1 billion. Yes, he's (allegedly) a billionaire. But even if he has $1 billion in assets--debatable, since he won't release his tax returns--he'll still need a huge amount of liquid cash to fund his campaign for the White House. Soon, he'll need cash to hire staff; build out an organization; recruit volunteers; craft advertisements and air them in media markets across the country; and fuel the day-to-day activities of a national political campaign, including get-out-the-vote efforts. And he has to do this in a few months, against a fully mobilized Democratic Party. After all, the other reason for narrow margins in presidential elections is the fact that both parties put forth almost equal efforts with nearly equivalent resources. In 2012, for example, Democrats spent $1.12 billion on Barack Obama's re-election effort, while Republicans spent $1.02 billion on the push to unseat him. In 2004, George W. Bush spent $345 million to win a narrow re-election race versus John Kerry's $310 million. Polarization and financial parity make presidential elections competitive. And losing that parity saddles you with a huge disadvantage. The 2008 election was favorable to Democrats, but the fact of Obama's unprecedented fundraising (he raised more money in one month, September, than John McCain had to spend for most of the fall) helps explain surprise results in states such as Indiana, a Republican stronghold that broke for Democrats for the first time since 1964. It's no exaggeration to say that Trump can't win the White House without this cash. It is a prerequisite. But there's a problem. There are conservative Republicans who don't want to back Trump. He didn't just run against their priorities; he gave every sign he doesn't care about the prevailing brand of conservatism as an ideology, which is why he promised to defend retirement programs from any cuts. This stance, however, creates a money problem. Some of those conservative Republicans are major donors and have ties to other major donors. They are integral to the Republican fundraising effort. Without them, Trump can't get to his $1 billion. Why did Mr. Trump go to Washington? Because he needs unity, and, more important, he needs dollars, and a lot of them. A fruitful meeting with Ryan is one way to get both. But it comes with baggage. Trump can't be Trump--contemptuous of conservative ideology, unafraid of breaking with political orthodoxy--if he wants to get conservative backing. He needs to switch things up. And early signs suggest he's doing just that. ""After the administration has been in place, then we will start to take a look at all of the programs, including entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare,"" said his chief policy adviser, Sam Clovis, on Wednesday. ""We'll start taking a hard look at those to start seeing what we can do in a bipartisan way."" Most Americans oppose these cuts. Republican elites, on the other hand, want them. And if Trump is going to get their money, he'll have to profess to wanting them, too. But a Trump who wants to cut ""entitlements"" is a Trump who could lose his appeal to the moderate, less ideological Republicans who fueled his victory. It's a Trump who doesn't just hold unpopular attitudes--on women, on immigrants, on religious minorities--but pushes for unpopular policies as well. He'd have his money and his unity--and an even worse shot at the White House. Read more Slate coverage of the Republican primary."	Why Donald Trump Needs Paul Ryan

Rocky Go Home On July 14, 1964, Nelson Rockefeller stepped to the podium at the Republican National Convention to get abused. It was nearly 10 p.m. Convention managers made sure to delay the proceedings as long as they could to deprive him of a satisfyingly large television audience. But if only a modest number of people were watching at home, all eyes were on him in the hall. Rockefeller, who would famously give a protester his middle finger as Gerald Ford's vice president in 1976, might as well have been doing the same to this audience. His jaw was clenched as the jeers echoed off the walls of the Cow Palace, an aging Quonset-like structure outside San Francisco. The audience supported conservative Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater, the all-but-certain nominee, and viewed Rockefeller, with his fondness for glossy art magazines, as the sneering embodiment of the Eastern establishment, which looked down at conservatives like Goldwater and his followers as unwashed ignoramuses. Rockefeller had competed against Goldwater in the primaries, labeling his followers kooks and declining to mask his contempt for their movement. The clash had played out most severely in the California primary. Rockefeller campaigned against Goldwater's ""reckless belligerence"" on foreign policy. Two weeks before the vote, Rockefeller, up 13 points in the polls, had sent a mailer to California voters asking, ""Who do you want in the room with the H Bomb button?"" Just days before the primary, however, Rockefeller's new wife gave birth to their first child. This reminded everyone that he once had an incumbent wife whom he divorced in order to marry the challenger. She was 18 years his junior and competed with him for scandal, in that she was married with four children at the time of their affair. William Loeb, the publisher of the influential Manchester, New Hampshire, Union Leader had called Rockefeller a ""wife swapper."" Goldwater fans asked during the primary: ""Do you want a Leader or a Lover in the White House?""i Rockefeller lost in California, and now that he was back in the state months later, he was getting it from both sides. Two days before, as the GOP convention was starting, Rockefeller had been heckled while addressing 25,000 civil rights marchers (including baseball great Jackie Robinson) who had gathered on Market Street in San Francisco to protest Goldwater. When he promised a strong civil rights plank in the GOP platform, they responded,ii ""Too late, too late."" ""We want Johnson!"" they yelled. It was the classic fate of the middle-of-the-road candidate: not just to be reviled, but to be associated with the extremists he opposed. Convention organizers had only given the vanquished Rockefeller five minutes to speak to the convention, but his remarks were a concentrated blast against the extremism and racism he said were ruining the party. ""These are people who have nothing in common with Americanism,"" said Rockefeller, standing beneath a portrait of Abraham Lincoln. ""The Republican Party must repudiate these people."" The crowd booed. ""We want Barry!"" they chanted. Then the noisemakers picked up. The Rockefeller haters blew squeeze-horns and toy trumpets and hooters. Someone pounded a giant bass drum. Those with cowbells got busy.iii Rockefeller couldn't be heard and stopped talking. Goldwaterites seated in the rafters shouted themselves hoarse. Organizers, who were all in the Goldwater camp, reminded the speaker that he had a time limit. ""You control the audience, and I'll make mine five minutes,"" he snapped. He was exhausted, having been kept up the night before by prank phone calls to his hotel room. His remarks were interrupted 22 times in five minutes. ""This is still a free country, ladies and gentlemen,"" Rockefeller said, condemning ""infiltration and takeover of established political parties by communist and Nazi methods."" ""It was as if Rockefeller were poking with a long lance and prodding a den of hungry lions,"" wrote Theodore White in Making of the President.iv ""They roared back at him."" It was a contentious moment that marked the last shot fired in a monthslong losing battle to stop Goldwater from winning the Republican nomination. The immediate stakes for Rockefeller's speech were not high. By the time he gave it, he and his allies had already been defeated but the ferocity of the exchange highlighted how passionate both sides still felt. The bitterness would last for years. The audience was angered afresh because Rockefeller sounded like a Democrat, casting them as the villains in the national morality play. If you held a different view than he did--particularly on civil rights--you were a racist or extremist. Or, at the very least, you were giving comfort to people with those views. Two nights later, Goldwater answered Rockefeller's charge in his acceptance speech. ""Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice,"" he said to roars of approval so loud they overwhelmed the capacity of the microphone, making it crackle. ""And let me remind you also, that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue."" This is what a real party fight looks like: When people stand up at a candidate's nominating convention and denounce the forces that allowed the candidate to win the nomination, and the candidate fires back with a defense rooted in the country's foundational ideals. The Republican Party conventions of 1952 and 1976 were cliffhangers, but they can't match the 1964 GOP convention for the melting heat of its ideological combat. The fight to stop Barry Goldwater was about first principles and values, not just tactical disputes about how to use a party's power. In the 2016 campaign, Republicans unhappy with Donald Trump started a #NeverTrump movement and it failed just as spectacularly. This week the talk is about GOP unity, but the fights of 1964 proved that blunt exchanges over deeply held views--about the size of government, the threats to liberty, the protection of rights, and the security of a nation--can sharpen what parties and their leaders believe in. Elections are a time for choosing more than just a candidate. Tale of Two Cow Palaces The last time the Republican Party visited the Cow Palace, originally built to host a livestock convention, was in 1956 for Eisenhower's second nomination. Before Eisenhower, Ulysses S. Grant was the last Republican president to have gone on to serve a second term. The '56 convention was, at the time, the high point for the modern GOP, and a high-water mark of comity. At the Cow Palace in 1964, the crowd was in a raucous mood and rushing in an entirely different direction. The Republican Party of 1964 had clear left and right wings in a form that would be unrecognizable today. Previous nominees had quickly worked to sew up the divisions and preached unity. In 1960, Goldwater himself had been a part of that unity effort, telling his allies on the right to ""grow up"" and work for the nominee, Nixon.v ""If we want to take this party back--and I think we can someday--let's go to work,"" he said. In 1964 though, Goldwater was sounding a call to arms. It was fine with him if the moderates jumped in a lake. Twice since the New Deal, moderates had nominated New York Gov. Thomas Dewey and twice he had lost, once to FDR and once to Truman. Conservatives were fed up with candidates who didn't give voters a clear break with New Deal Democratic rule. In 1952, conservatives fell in love with Robert Taft but Eisenhower interrupted their dreams and gave moderates eight years in the White House. For conservatives, Eisenhower's victories had come at the cost of principle. The National Review, the organ of the movement, opposed Eisenhower and his move toward centrism. Its publisher, William Rusher, said that ""modern American conservatism largely organized itself during, and in opposition to, the Eisenhower Administration."" Goldwater called the Eisenhower administration a ""dime-store New Deal."" As if to punctuate the point, when Eisenhower stopped in Amarillo, Texas, on the way to the '64 convention, two young men hurled a Goldwater sign in a fit of enthusiasm. They were not aiming at the ex-president but hit him nevertheless, causing him to double over.vi Moderate Republicans like Rockefeller supported the national consensus toward advancing civil rights by promoting national legislation to protect the vote, employment, housing, and other elements of the American promise denied to blacks. They sought to contain communism, not eradicate it, and they had faith that the government could be a force for good if it were circumscribed and run efficiently. They believed in experts and belittled the Goldwater approach, which held that complex problems could be solved merely by the application of common sense. It was not a plus to the Rockefeller camp that Goldwater had publicly admitted, ""You know, I haven't got a really first-class brain.""vii Politically, moderates believed that these positions would preserve the Republican Party in a changing America. Conservatives wanted to restrict government from meddling in private enterprise and the free exercise of liberty. They thought bipartisanship and compromise were leading to collectivism and fiscal irresponsibility. On national security, Goldwater and his allies felt Eisenhower had been barely fighting the communists, and that the Soviets were gobbling up territory across the globe. At one point, Goldwater appeared to muse about dropping a low-yield nuclear bomb on the Chinese supply lines in Vietnam, though it may have been more a press misunderstanding than his actual view.viii Conservatives believed that by promoting these ideas, they were not just saving a party--they were rescuing the American experiment. Politically, they saw in Goldwater a chance to break the stranglehold of the Eastern moneyed interests. If a candidate could raise money and build an organization without being beholden to the Eastern power brokers, then such a candidate could finally represent the interests of authentic Americans, the silent majority that made the country an exceptional one. Goldwater looked like the leader of a party that was moving west. His head seemed fashioned from sandstone. An Air Force pilot, his skin was taut, as though he'd always left the window open on his plane. He would not be mistaken for an East Coast banker. The likely nominee disagreed most violently with moderates over the issue of federal protections for the rights of black Americans. In June, a month before the convention, the Senate had voted on the Civil Rights Act. Twenty-seven of 33 Republicans voted for the legislation. Goldwater was one of the six who did not, arguing that the law was unconstitutional. ""The structure of the federal system, with its 50 separate state units, has long permitted this nation to nourish local differences, even local cultures,"" wrote Goldwater in Where I Stand. Though Goldwater had voted for previous civil rights legislation and had founded the Arizona Air National Guard as a racially integrated unit, moderates rejected his reasoning. They said it was a disguise to cover his political appeal to anxious white voters whom he needed to win the primaries. He was courting not just Southern whites, but whites in the North and the Midwest who were worried about the speed of change in America and competition from newly empowered blacks. Here Come the Governors The Stop Goldwater movement took real shape not long after he won the California primary on June 2. Goldwater's opponents weren't just worried that Goldwater's hawkishness and scattershot positions--which seemed to shift from interview to interview--would lose him the presidency. They worried he would irreparably stain the party and hex Republicans also running for election that year. Sen. Ken Keating of New York said he would not run as a Republican against Bobby Kennedy, but as an independent. Sen. Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania, who had been chairman of the Republican Party and had been a part of the successful Draft Eisenhower movement, said that if Goldwater were nominated, he'd bring 30 Republican members of Congress down with him that November.ix New York Sen. Jacob Javits, a moderate Republican, said that Goldwater's victory would wrench the social order out of its sockets. ""The Republican establishment is desperate to defeat me,"" Goldwater said. ""They can't stand having someone they can't control."" On June 7, a month before the GOP convention, 15 Republican governors sat at breakfast at the Cleveland Sheraton before a meeting of the National Governors Association. If anyone was going to stop Goldwater, it would be the governors. Historian Rick Perlstein explains why:"	Never Goldwater: How the Fight to Defeat the Arizona Senator Gave Birth to the Modern GOP

He's going to bring millions of new voters into the Republican Party. He's going to sweep the industrial Midwest. ""I will win Michigan. ... I will win Pennsylvania. ... I will win Florida,"" Trump predicted last week. ""New York is in play,"" too, he said. ""I will win Upstate New York by massive numbers. I will win out on Long Island by massive numbers. ... I will win sections of [New York] City that nobody else could win."" Trump's talk of broadening the electoral map, like everything else he says, is bluster. He's the worst Republican presidential nominee in at least 50 years. His puerile, erratic, abrasive behavior has alienated millions of people. That's not speculation; it's a mathematical fact established by numerous polls. General-election polls at this stage in the cycle are far from dispositive, so I won't call Trump toast. But surveys in key states show how unpopular he has become, and how badly he performs in comparison with previous and alternative Republican nominees. To measure Trump's predicament, I've put together the best available data in the battleground states. I started with 10 states that have voted for both parties in the past five elections: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia. I added two states that Trump says he'll win (Michigan and Pennsylvania), two more that others say he could win (Minnesota and Wisconsin), one that he claims he could win (New York), and one that's surprisingly close (Georgia). In each of these 16 states, I looked for recent polls that asked people how they would vote in a hypothetical matchup between Trump and Hillary Clinton. I wanted polls that could be compared with similar surveys, ideally by the same pollster, at the same point in the 2012 election. I also looked for surveys in which Trump's performance could be compared with two of his Republican competitors, Gov. John Kasich and Sen. Marco Rubio, in net favorability or in matchups with Clinton. The purpose of choosing these polls was to cancel out extraneous factors--sample, timing, survey methods--and clarify how bad Trump's position is relative to Kasich, Rubio, and the GOP's most recent presidential nominee, Mitt Romney. In 13 of the 16 states--all but Colorado, Iowa, and Nevada--I found sufficiently recent and comparable surveys. In 10 states, the previous samples used for comparison were taken by the same pollsters four years earlier. By adding a few more polls to the analysis, we can compare, within the same samples, Trump's performance with Kasich's performance--or, in states where Kasich wasn't tested, with Rubio's performance. The data expose Trump as a disaster. (You can find all the polling data I used here.) Let's start with the four states he bragged about last week. Republicans have a good shot at Michigan, but not with Trump as their nominee. In an EPIC-MRA survey taken several weeks ago, Kasich beat Clinton in Michigan by 5 percentage points. In the same survey, Trump lost to Clinton by 11 points. In Pennsylvania, a Quinnipiac survey showed Kasich beating Clinton by 16 points. In the same sample, Trump lost to Clinton by 3 points. In Florida, Kasich wasn't tested, but Rubio made the state a tossup against Clinton. Trump lost the state to Clinton by 8 points. In New York, where Kasich trailed Clinton by 10 points, Trump trailed her by 19. Collectively, the data imply that with Kasich or Rubio at the top of the ticket, the GOP would beat Clinton in five states Romney lost: Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. (See table below.) That's 60 electoral votes. Add that to Romney's 206, and you're at 266. From there, any state puts you over the top. It could be Colorado, Iowa, or Nevada. It could be Florida. It could be Virginia, where a poll showed Clinton trailing Rubio by 3 percentage points, or Ohio, where another poll showed her losing to Kasich by 2. But the Republican nominee won't be Kasich or Rubio. It'll be Trump. And in the same surveys where Kasich or Rubio beats Clinton, Trump loses. He loses Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin--all the potential battleground states Romney lost. That doesn't mean Trump will lose all these states on Election Day. From poll to poll, numbers vary. This week, for instance, Quinnipiac released new surveys that show Trump leading Clinton by 4 points in Ohio and trailing her by only a point in Florida and Pennsylvania. But those polls didn't test Kasich or Rubio, so they don't shed light on what we're trying to capture here: discrepancies, within the same samples, between Trump's performance and the performance of alternative candidates. Trump also jeopardizes some Romney states. Romney won four of the 13 states on the list: Arizona, Georgia, Missouri, and North Carolina. Polls suggest that with Kasich or Rubio atop the ticket, the GOP would easily keep at least three of those states. (Georgia is unclear, since its most recent survey tested only Trump against Clinton.) In the same polls, Trump is shaky. He loses Arizona, puts Missouri in play, and turns North Carolina and Georgia into tossups. That's 42 electoral votes, potentially dropping him to 164. A lot can change between now and November. We don't know how the numbers in each state will move, but we can use Romney as a model. Let's suppose that in each state, from the most recent poll to Election Day, Trump's performance relative to Clinton changes as much as Romney's performance did relative to Barack Obama during the same period in 2012. That's a generous assumption, given Trump's high negative ratings (see below), but let's give him the benefit of the doubt. In that case, Trump would win Arizona and Missouri, but he would lose Georgia. (See table below.) North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania would be very close. But even if Trump won all three, he'd be stuck at 228 electoral votes. If we apply the same rule of thumb to alternative nominees--measuring how Obama and Romney performed in each state, compared with their poll numbers at this point, and applying the same increase or decrease to this year's Democratic and Republican candidates--Kasich and Rubio do much better than Trump. In that scenario, the GOP would win Arizona, Missouri, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and probably Georgia, for a total of 268 electoral votes. Michigan would be a tossup. Florida would be within 2 percentage points of flipping to the GOP. Virginia would be within 3 points. Any of those three states would put Republicans over the top. If none of them came through, Colorado, Iowa, or Nevada would do the trick. Why does Trump, as a general-election candidate, fare worse than the Republican rivals he vanquished? Because while most Republican voters like him, most Americans don't. Trump calls Romney a choker for losing in 2012. But this year, voters are choking on Trump. In each of the 10 battleground states where comparable polls are available, Trump's net favorable rating--the percentage of voters who view him favorably, minus the percentage who view him unfavorably--is worse than Romney's was at the same point in 2012. (See table below.) On average, the difference is 24 percentage points. That's a brutal handicap. Trump is so repellent that he's losing to Clinton, a candidate with severe image problems of her own. On average, in the 10 states with comparable polls, Clinton's net favorable rating is almost as far below Obama's (at the same point in his 2012 campaign) as Trump's is below Romney's. A decent Republican could beat her. In the eight states where Kasich's favorability was tested against Clinton's, his net rating exceeded hers by an average of 27 percentage points. (See table below.) In a ninth state, Minnesota, Kasich wasn't tested against Clinton, but Rubio--another guy Trump likes to ridicule as a choker--was. Rubio's net favorable rating was 20 points higher than Clinton's. That's a significant advantage for Republicans. Only a choker could squander it, and Trump is doing just that. On average, in the key states, his net favorable rating trails Clinton's by 17 percentage points. Her net ratings are bad, ranging from +2 in New York to -28 in Ohio. Trump's ratings, however, are atrocious, ranging from -16 in Pennsylvania to -54 in New Hampshire. He's a gift to the Democratic Party. You could argue that polls overrate Kasich and Rubio because their dirty laundry, unlike Trump's, hasn't been aired. That's true of Sen. Bernie Sanders: His performance as the hypothetical Democratic nominee in general-election polls is inflated, because Clinton hasn't hammered, or even addressed, all the nasty things about Sanders that Republicans would bring up in the fall. But Trump has unloaded freely on Kasich and Rubio. In debates, ads, and primaries, he told us all about Rubio's credit cards and Kasich's work at Lehman Brothers. Trump's problem isn't that voters know more about him than they do about Rubio or Kasich. His problem is that he's Trump. Some polls expose Trump's wretchedness in greater detail. In 2012, Romney's favorable ratings in New Hampshire were poor among independents, Democrats, union households, and people with little education. This year, in a survey by the same pollster at the same point in the race, Trump's ratings in these demographic groups are worse--by 24 points among independents, 29 points among Democrats, 23 points among union households, and 19 points among people with a high school education or less. In Michigan, 40 percent of voters say their view of Clinton is very unfavorable. Only 10 percent express such antipathy toward Kasich, but 51 percent express it toward Trump. In Wisconsin, 42 percent of voters say they're very uncomfortable with the prospect of Clinton as president. For Kasich, the number is 12 percent. For Trump, it's 56 percent. In Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, voters rate Trump below Clinton in presidential temperament, intelligence, moral standards, and caring about ""people like you."" These polls don't prove Trump will lose. But they do provide a set of controlled experiments. They test his performance and the performance of other candidates in common samples, by identical methods, or at similar times in the campaign cycle. In this way, they quantify the damage he's doing to his party. By nominating Trump instead of Kasich or Rubio, Republicans have sacrificed more than 40 percentage points in net favorability. They've jeopardized a dozen states and more than 150 electoral votes. If they lose, Trump will do what he always does: blame everyone else. But his defeat--like his tower, his casinos, and all those diplomas handed out by his scam university--will bear his name. Welcome to the general election, Donald. The choke's on you.

6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/black_and_latino_voters_aren_t_going_anywhere.html	"The first ""swing state"" surveys of 2016 are here, and the news isn't good for Hillary Clinton. According to a new Quinnipiac poll, the likely Democratic nominee is just a nose ahead of Donald Trump in Florida and Pennsylvania, where she leads 43 percent to Trump's 42. In Ohio, she's behind, 39 percent to Trump's 43. It's a result in line with the theory of Trump's campaign--that he can break into the Rust Belt and expand the Republican Party's coalition to states that traditionally break for the Democratic nominee, in addition to occasional GOP strongholds like Florida. But there's a problem. When the pollsters at Quinnipiac took their snapshot of the presidential race, they didn't assume a static electorate from 2012, where nonwhites were 30 percent of voters in Florida, 18 percent in Ohio, and 19 percent in Pennsylvania. Instead, in Quinnipiac's view, a significant number of nonwhites have left the voting pool, leaving those states with whiter electorates than they had four years prior. By Quinnipiac's lights, today's electorates in Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania are between 4 to 5 points whiter than they were in 2012. If national elections are determined by national swings--where most voters move in tandem, one way or another--then this implies something like a three-point swing among all groups toward the GOP, which would give Trump a narrow win in all three states, and the national popular vote. (I used RealClearPolitics' demographic calculator for that result.) This is possible in the same way that there's a nonzero chance a safe will fall on your head at this very moment. But that doesn't mean it's likely. And when you look at the evidence, the idea that nonwhites will leave the electorate--especially in this Age of Trump--is ludicrous. The standard narrative for nonwhite voting in a presidential year is this: Before Barack Obama, blacks and Latinos turned out to vote in modest and static numbers. After Obama's 2008 campaign, they began to vote in droves, transforming the American electorate. Now, with Obama and his historic candidacy off of the ballot, they'll return to the sidelines. Every part of this narrative is wrong. A quick glance at black presidential voting shows a clear upward trend, beginning in 1996, not 2008. That year, black turnout hit a low of 53 percent. Four years later, it grew to 56.8 percent. It grew again to 60 percent in 2004, and grew slightly more than the 3.5-point average to 64.7 percent in 2008, and reached 66.2 percent in 2012, surpassing white turnout for the first time in American history. Growing black turnout preceded Barack Obama's campaign by more than a decade. It increased on his watch, but it wasn't a dramatic change. And more importantly, that increase wasn't because of Obama as a figure or a symbol. It was hard work. ""[D]oor-to-door, mail, phone, and Internet activities of the political parties may have been more of a factor in mobilizing Blacks than an amorphous, media-driven buzz surrounding Obama's charismatic and historic candidacy,"" write Tasha Philpot, Daron Shaw, and Ernest McGowen in a paper titled ""Winning the Race: Black Voter Turnout in the 2008 Presidential Election."" This is still operative. Hillary Clinton's primary campaign devoted substantial resources to reaching and mobilizing black communities, to great effect--in the Super Tuesday states, black voters reached or exceeded their vote share relative to the last Democratic primary, in 2008. Hispanic turnout has also grown, from 44 percent in 1996 to a high of nearly 50 percent in 2008. But it decreased to 48 percent in the 2012 election. In general, turnout among Hispanic and Latino voters tends to lag far behind their share of eligible voters and registered voters. But there are early signs that turnout may rebound and return to its earlier trajectory. Since January, the rate of Hispanic voter registration has doubled in California and increased by large margins in North Carolina and Georgia. While some of this reflects the extent to which the country's Hispanic population skews young, there's evidence that it's a reaction to Trump and his vocal, anti-immigrant rhetoric. If that's true, we could see a growth in the total number of Hispanic voters and the share of them that go to the polls. And either way, if the turnout rate for Hispanic voters simply holds steady, they'll have a larger impact than in 2012, given their growth in the electorate. None of this guarantees a Clinton win or means that Trump can't win Pennsylvania or Ohio or Florida. But it does call Quinnipiac's assumption of a smaller nonwhite electorate--shared by many other pundits and observers--into question. The trends and the numbers suggest the opposite--that blacks and Hispanics (and Asian Americans) will again constitute a large share of the voting population, that their turnout will stay steady, perhaps even increase. That last point is key. Trump's nativist, anti-immigrant rhetoric is as likely to bring a nonwhite backlash as it is to bring new white voters to the polls. Trump may increase white turnout--or simply keep it steady--and at the same time dig a deeper hole with nonwhite voters as they vote against him in decisive numbers. So far, the story of the 2016 election is the story of Donald Trump and the rise of militant white identity politics. But come November, we may have to revise that for another narrative thread: the rise of a powerful nonwhite electorate, and how it helped save the country from its worst impulses.

He's something of an oddball, this Ben Sasse; he feels his feelings deeply and jots them down on Facebook while sitting by the Platte River. After much feeling of his feelings, he has arrived at the conclusion that a third candidate should join and win this presidential election. Should be a cinch. So what is a ""Ben Sasse,"" and how did he arrive at this wrong conclusion? Sasse was elected to the Senate in 2014. In that cycle of Establishment vs. Tea Party Senate primaries, it was unclear in Nebraska which candidate, Sasse or former state Treasurer Shane Osborn, represented which side. It was such a muddle that FreedomWorks, one of the original national Tea Party organizations, switched its endorsement to Sasse after originally endorsing Osborn, prompting the resignation of one of its vice presidents. Since coming to the Senate, Sasse has amassed an arch-conservative's voting record. He was recently the lone dissenting vote against a bill to combat opioid abuse, which he believes is a state- and local-government issue. Sasse's professional background has been in governmental policy work, involving several gigs in the Bush administration, and in academia. Prior to the Senate he served as a college president and prior to the Bush administration he collected diplomas. There's a bachelor's degree from Harvard in the pile, along with a Ph.D. and a couple of master's from Yale. But the most revealing degree in Sasse's stack may be the master's from St. John's College in Maryland, a tiny liberal arts school where students learn how to sit by rivers and consider their feelings. Sasse is a testament to the value of such a liberal arts education. Sasse was anointed a Never Trump leader earlier this year when he became the first senator to aver that he would never support Trump. Once Trump had wrapped up the nomination, Sasse went down by the river to write a Facebook post. The letter begins with anecdotes from his trip to Walmart earlier in the day, during which voters of various stripes told him they liked neither Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump. From this he concluded that a majority of the country would rather vote for a third candidate running on a platform of enhanced cybersecurity and entitlement reform. Though he claims that this candidate need not pass any ideological litmus tests, he is not immune to the temptations of partisan rhetoric."

9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/what_pundits_keep_getting_wrong_about_donald_trump_and_the_working_class.html	"Most analysis of Donald Trump's electability hinges on his working-class appeal--specifically, working-class anger at the economic arrangements of a post-recession America. ""The deeper, long-term reasons for today's rage are not hard to find, although many of us elites have shamefully found ourselves able to ignore them,"" writes Andrew Sullivan, now of New York magazine, in an essay on Trump, his rise, and its threat to American democracy. ""The jobs available to the working class no longer contain the kind of craftsmanship or satisfaction or meaning that can take the sting out of their low and stagnant wages."" But something happens in this discussion of working-class anger. Sullivan, like others tackling the subject, moves from an analysis of the ""working class"" to an analysis of the ""white working class,"" gliding between the two as if they're synonymous. ""This is an age in which a woman might succeed a black man as president, but also one in which a member of the white working class has declining options to make a decent living,"" he writes. ""This is a time when gay people can be married in 50 states, even as working-class families are hanging by a thread."" This is a critical conflation. If the ""working class"" and the ""white working class"" are synonymous, then Trump is a genuine threat--a demagogue who can channel and ride mass frustration to the White House. And it bolsters Sullivan's (and others') subordinate point: that liberals bear a great deal of blame for Trump for having stigmatized working-class morals and attitudes and ignoring their anger and economic anxiety, thus alienating them from mainstream politics and leaving them ripe for a figure like Trump. Except there's a problem. The American working class has changed. A lot. In the collective mind's eye of political pundits and observers, the ""working class"" is what it was a generation ago: largely white and mostly male, with a heavy presence in trades and factories. There are still Americans who fit this description. But they're also a shrinking portion of the working class, and the attention they receive perennially from political observers--many of whom see them as the pivot around which American politics turns--is entirely out of proportion to their declining numbers. As recently as 2013, more than 60 percent of working-class Americans between 25 and 54 years old were white. If you extend the age bracket to 64, that increases to nearly 63 percent. But in 2014, those numbers--for the first category--dropped to 59.6 percent. In 2015, it was 58.8 percent. This year, non-Hispanic whites are 58 percent of the working class, a historic low. People of color make up more than a third of America's labor force, and they're a large and growing plurality of working-class people in particular. As of this year, 23.5 percent of working people are Hispanic; 15 percent are black; and 3.5 percent are Asian American. That's a total of 42 percent. In 10 years, they'll constitute nearly half of all working-class Americans. As it stands, the youngest cohort of working-class Americans--at 54.4 percent white and 45.5 percent nonwhite--is almost there. And close to half of all working-class people--across all races and ethnic groups--are women working in service jobs as well as traditional blue-collar professions. Much of this ""new"" working class, including a substantial minority of its whites, leans Democratic; they backed Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, and many support Hillary Clinton in this year's Democratic primary. They aren't alienated by movements for immigrant rights and police reform; they're sympathetic. They're not just the beneficiaries of the liberal push for greater inclusion; they're often the people driving it. These Americans, women in particular, are an integral part of the new liberal majority. Tally the numbers and you'll find that Trump's appeal falls well outside the large plurality (if not majority) of working-class Americans who are either people of color (young or otherwise), or liberal to moderate whites. And you see this in polls of Trump's favorability. In terms of popularity with blacks, Hispanics, women, and young people, the real estate mogul's polling is somewhere in the Marianas Trench. The truth is that it's inaccurate to talk about Trump's ""working-class appeal."" What Trump has, instead, is a message tailored to a conservative portion of white workers. These voters aren't the struggling whites of Appalachia or the old Rust Belt, in part because those workers don't vote, and there's no evidence Trump has turned them out. Instead, Trump is winning those whites with middle-class incomes. Given his strength in unionized areas like the Northeast, some are blue collar and culturally working class. But many others are not. Many others are what we would simply call Republicans. Even if Trump had a broad working-class message, it's important to remember that people engage politics in different ways through different identities. A working-class black woman doesn't have to be sympathetic to unauthorized immigrants to see threat in Trump's rhetoric against outsiders; a working-class Hispanic man doesn't have to hold politically correct attitudes about Muslim Americans to fear a candidate who promises a ban on a whole category of people. Given their high religiosity, black voters at one point were supposed to turn against Democrats on same-sex marriage. But the issue wasn't salient for their politics--or at least, not salient in a contest between Republicans and Democrats. They remained in the fold. Sullivan is right that the times call for vigilance. Against an unprecedented figure like Trump, complacency is dangerous. But we should also have clear eyes. Insofar that he represents any of it, Trump just speaks for a portion of working America, and the same divisions of race and religion that make broad working-class movements rare also limit the ability of a Trump figure to succeed. Why pundits can't see this--why so many consistently miss the degree to which America is browner and blacker than it's ever been--might have something to do with who they are. America's commentary class is largely white. America's voters, increasingly, are not. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	What Pundits Keep Getting Wrong About Donald Trump and the Working Class
10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/i_m_a_republican_and_i_m_not_voting_for_donald_trump.html	"""Would you rather have the mumps or the measles?"" That's the question my husband posed to our 12-year-old son Tuesday night when he asked us whom we'd rather see elected in November, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. (We may or may not have also inquired as to his preference between two unpleasant gastrointestinal maladies.) This will be a historic election if for no other reason than that it will give us a choice between two candidates with the highest unfavorable ratings of any major party nominees ever: It's the opposite of the old paradox--this November, a stoppable object will meet a resistible force. Each is a uniquely detestable individual. Against someone even marginally likable, either would be toast. But, barring any magically unifying third-party run, one of them will be elected president. While that makes it tempting to consider options for offshoring our savings or checking out the real-estate market in tropical climes--real Republicans would never move to Canada, of all places--the reality is that I love my country and I'm not willing to give up entirely on my party, even when it's lost its way. That, and our home value has never really recovered from the housing crash. So come November, doing my civic duty will be a wholly unwelcome challenge. ""Are you voting for Hillary or abstaining or what?"" I'm a Republican who's been vocal about not supporting Trump, so I was not surprised when that question came flying at me from several directions Tuesday night after Ted Cruz suspended his campaign and made Trump the presumptive nominee. No, I won't vote for Hillary. It might well be that she is the least-terrible option come November. Unlike the overly timid, reactive current occupant of the White House, she probably won't shy away from conflicts that warrant America's intervention. All talk of Bernie Sanders pushing Hillary leftward will end once his campaign does, and thus will end her pandering on the minimum wage and similar issues. If the Republicans can maintain even a tenuous grip on Congress, she'll be limited in what she can do. All the same, no. She's underhanded. She engages in shameless propaganda about gender politics in the United States while her family's foundation gins up donations from regimes that oppress women. She says that we should believe all accusers in sexual assault cases--except those who accused her husband of impropriety. The scandal around her home-based private email server revealed, at minimum, the degree to which she thinks she's above the law. And her primary fashion influences seem to be Communist dictators. While I hold out hope that Hillary would be a disappointing but not terrible one-term president, a lot of damage can be done to the Supreme Court in four years. Three of the eight justices are 77 or older. A decade or more of 6-3 lockstep liberal decisions is too frightening of a prospect. ""Could you ever vote for Trump?"" Nope. Never. I imagine at some point, maybe in October, maybe when Hillary is putting on that faux Southern accent to make nice in a red state, my resolve will be tested. Which is one reason I am writing this down in permanent ink, right here. Still no. There are so, so many reasons. He's a jerk. He's a hypocrite. If he's not actually racist himself, he's fomenting racism and using it to his advantage, which might be worse. In the end, what rises above even those obvious reasons is that Donald Trump is not by any reasonable standards a conservative. It's not clear that he has any consistent ideology, but whatever one he might have is not conservative. He's against free trade. He's an isolationist. He's not repulsed by Planned Parenthood. He has supported single-payer health care, for crying out loud. His purported foreign policy is contradictory and incoherent and includes no actual policy. It's frightening to think Hillary could end up with a few seats to fill on the Supreme Court. But who really wants Trump to have the seats and our nuclear codes? My colleague Michelle Goldberg might be right that Republicans ""were always going to fall in line"" behind Trump. I can't let myself be so cynical. Maybe it was inevitable that our politicians would. It will be painful for me to watch the GOP convention and see men and women whom I consider to be genuine conservatives and honorable Americans stand up and give speeches praising a crass, cynical narcissist as the champion of a once-proud party. But the GOP is more than its politicians. There are millions of rank-and-file voters who are dismayed by Trump's hijacking of the party and many thousands, surely, who will not be able to bring themselves to check that box in November. Maybe we will stay home; maybe we will vote Libertarian; maybe someone will prevail upon Mitt Romney to ride in on his unicorn under a third party's banner. I abhor the idea of Hillary Clinton being our next president. But Donald Trump is bad not only for the Republican Party, but for America. The price of such a victory is too dear.

Several of them went on to say that they no longer considered themselves Republicans, so appalled were they by Trump's rise and the cravenness of the many Republicans who've enabled him. To state the obvious, these are two different sentiments. Opposing Trump's bid for the presidency was the right thing to do during the primaries, and it is the right thing to do now that he is the presumptive nominee. If his not-so-coded appeals to racial and ethnic resentment weren't enough to disqualify him, his extreme credulousness--for example, his claim that Rafael Cruz, the father of Ted, was somehow involved in the plot to assassinate John F. Kennedy, based entirely on a story that appeared in the National Enquirer--tells us that he is a man in desperate need of help. That a plurality of Republican primary voters have nevertheless backed Trump is dismaying in the extreme. But is it a reason to abandon the GOP? I say no. My case for sticking with the Republican Party is not a sentimental one. The rise of Trump has convinced many of my conservative comrades that the GOP is a cesspool. I have to ask: Did you believe that the GOP was the home of heroes and legends before he came on the scene? I've been in and around the conservative movement for my entire adult life, and I've seen more than my fair share of self-described conservative true believers doing the bidding of hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, Hollywood conglomerates, and unsavory foreign governments. I've also seen people of great integrity work tirelessly for little pay and even less recognition to make this country a freer, fairer, and more decent place. The Republican Party may well be a party of charlatans and cranks. But it is also the party of millions of middle-class Americans who believe that the role of government is to empower people, not to render them powerless and dependent. I stand with those in my party who share my ideals and to work with them to defeat those who do not. To be clear, this is not always fun. It just happens to be necessary. Like all parties in a democracy like ours, the GOP is a site of contestation. That's a fancy way of saying there is no one answer as to what it means to be a Republican. Right now, Donald Trump has emerged as the face of the GOP, an outcome that many Republicans fought hard to prevent. Just a few short months ago, Bernie Sanders was adamant that he did not want to run for president as a Democrat. Now his supporters are working to remake the Democratic Party in his image, and they may well succeed. By 2020 or 2024, both of our major parties may well look radically different. The GOP is less a single, solid thing than a never-ending rumble, in which different factions duke it out over which one of them will temporarily control the party's brand and its infrastructure. Leaving the Republican Party now would mean, essentially, ceding control of its considerable resources to your factional rivals. Such a decision might be logical if you've decided that you're all in for a $15 minimum wage or if increasing less-skilled immigration is the issue that matters to you most. In that case, then you should probably join the Democratic Party. But for a conservative like me, it still makes sense to stake out territory under the GOP tent. This is not how parties work everywhere. In the U.S., we generally rely on first-past-the-post elections, in which the candidate with the most votes wins. Many other countries use proportional representation systems, wherein legislative seats get allocated to parties based on their share of the electorate, e.g., a party that wins 30 percent of the vote will win 30 percent of the seats. The upshot of this approach is that it almost always leads to multi-party systems, with smaller, more ideologically cohesive parties. Israel has a particularly lively and dynamic political system, in which parties are formed and go out of business quite often. To pass legislation, these miniparties must join together in coalitions. The beauty of a system like Israel's is that it more accurately reflects the many ways in which each voter is a special snowflake. No, you won't have a party that precisely reflects your many quirks. You can't order up a political party the way you'd order a sugary beverage at your local Starbucks. (""I'd like a Marxist Frappuccino with a dash of dog-eat-dog Social Darwinism, please."") But you will come much closer to finding one that matches your idiosyncratic beliefs than you would in a country with only two viable parties. If the U.S. had something like Israel's system, you can imagine a political party for, say, evangelical Tea Party conservatives who are passionate about the pro-life cause, one for secular immigration hard-liners who want to slap tariffs on Chinese imports, and another for Northeastern moderates who support abortion rights and the elimination of capital gains taxes. These three different parties might unite on some issues while going their separate ways on others. Under our system, these three factions are united under the banner of the GOP, a party that is a coalition unto itself. Factions rooted in very different ideological traditions, regions, and religious and cultural backgrounds join together in one big catch-all party in the hope that they can aggregate enough votes to inch ahead of the other big catch-all party. I can see why a system more like Israel's might be preferable to our own. For one thing, it would come as a huge relief to the members of one faction who can't stand the idea of being associated with the quislings, boobs, and boors found in the others. I've actually called for adopting a proportional representation system in Slate, and if we were to move in that direction, I'd be a lot more comfortable with saying goodbye to the GOP. Until then, however, I'm going to stay and fight. I won't vote for Donald Trump, and if Mitt Romney ran for president as a third-party candidate, I'd vote for him with pride. But in the long term, I'm sticking with the GOP. There is no guarantee that anti-Trump conservatives like myself will succeed in winning the party's future. But the only way we're certain to lose is if we give up now, precisely when the party needs us most."	I Hate Donald Trump, but I Am Not Leaving the Republican Party

I'm here on the campaign trail, tracking Bernie Sanders from Bloomington to South Bend. I've been asked to pause my noble journalistic mission to offer you a bit of behind-the-scenes dope on what it's like to cover this election cycle in the flesh. In a word: depleting. I've parachuted onto the trail for just a week or two at a time, here and there, but each taste of campaign life confirms how physically taxing this would be as a full-time lifestyle. I pity the reporter ""embeds"" who've been trailing the candidates for months, with months more on the horizon. They'll cover a rally or a town hall, rush to file something smart about it, pack up their gear (for many modern, ""one-man-band"" digital journalists, this includes bulky equipment--video camera, tripod, lights), and then sprint to their rental cars to chase the candidate's bus to the next stop. Sometimes it's three stops in one day, separated by hundreds of miles. Sometimes it's thousands of miles, if the campaign takes wing to another state. Following Donald Trump, I went from Chicago to Cleveland to Boca Raton, Florida, in the space of two-and-a-half days--each stop replete with a harried rental car return, a rush to a boarding gate, and then a resumption of the marathon on the other side. It's easy to forget where you are. You jolt to life in an undifferentiated Marriott--two queen beds, TV still on from when you passed out the night before--and you hunt for clues as to which part of the country you've awoken in. Your sole glimpses of local life are the roadside scenery beyond your windshield, the pleasant conversations with friendly waiters at late-night diners, or the sudden realization that the accents at the airport car-rental counter have morphed into something strange and new. It's unfathomable that reporters once did this without smartphones. Following Jeb Bush around South Carolina in February, I found myself navigating one-lane dirt roads, praying that cell service would pertain in the deepest reaches of the state and that Google Maps wouldn't steer me wrong. Imagine trying to chart your route on a fold-up roadmap that accordions across your dashboard, dips into your coffee cup, and fails to alert you that you've veered 50 miles off course and will soon dead-end into a hog farm. If you read journalistic diaries of previous campaigns--Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72 or David Foster Wallace's McCain's Promise--you learn that some things never change. Reporters have always balanced a duty to file fresh copy with a duty to show up at the next rally and, like, actually observe stuff. Thompson wrestled his typewriter from hotel to hotel. Wallace sympathetically noted his compatriots' frazzled attempts to charge up their 2000-era paleo-laptops and feeble flip-phones. Everybody's always tired. Everybody's always annoyed at the lack of access to candidates. Everybody nurtures pet resentments toward members of the campaign staff. Everybody harbors frenemy feuds with other journos seeking the same scooplets. Everybody's plants and/or relationships are wilting back home. Different candidates have different vibes out on the trail. Jeb Bush rallies (I hesitate to even call them rallies--more like low-energy tea-time conversations with a few dozen gentle souls) tended to be quiet affairs with much time given over to answering voters' detailed policy questions. Bernie events have been raucous but good-natured, with fellow believers basking in each other's righteous fervor. I don't think I could last if I had to cover Trump as a full-time job. I couldn't listen to him lie at me for 45 straight minutes, three times a day. I never grew accustomed to the ever-present threat of violence in his crowds. After the infamous canceled Chicago rally that devolved into elbow-throwing mayhem, I was so shaken I got actual jitters. Though in general I only bum cigarettes after three beers in a softball dugout, I found myself stumbling out of the arena and through the angry throngs outside to buy a pack at the corner gas station and suck down a Marlboro. If you have more questions about life on the trail, put them in the comments and I'll try to respond in a spare moment. But right now it's time for me to get back in the saddle. My rental Hyundai is littered with fast food wrappers and empty Diet Coke bottles. My phone needs charging and my audio recorder needs new batteries. Bernie's speaking here in South Bend soon, so I've just checked into a bizarre Notre Dame-themed hotel with Knute Rockne memorabilia lining the walls. I hope my plants back home are alive."

He's a dangerous ""authoritarian."" A ""race-baiter"" and a ""racist"" who divides Americans for political gain. An ""arrogant"" celebrity of a politician who has no place in the Oval Office. An ""unqualified,"" ""incompetent"" fraud who ""simply does not understand what it means to be president."" Hell, he can barely give a speech. If you guessed Donald Trump, you're not wrong on the merits. Trump is a bona fide authoritarian, with a tenuous commitment to the foundations of liberal democracy, from personal liberty (eviscerated by his plan for mass deportation) to freedom of the press. His entire campaign is an exercise in conjuring bigotry for political gain, from his initial call for a wall to keep Mexico from sending ""criminals"" and ""rapists"" and subsequent one for a ban on Muslim entry to the United States to his coy relationship with white supremacists (Trump refused to disavow former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke) and constant repetition of anti-Muslim myths, including a widely debunked claim that New Jersey Muslim Americans celebrated the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.* There's more! Trump is a literal celebrity, whose public resume amounts to playing a demanding boss on network television. If experience in political office (or in high military service) is a prerequisite for sitting in the White House, then Trump is wildly unqualified. If he's demonstrated any knowledge or mastery of public policy, it's lost to history. In fact, by his own admission, Trump doesn't even have policies. Instead, his pronouncements are just ""suggestions"" for the sake of making deals. And his plans, such that they exist, hold no ties to reality. It's not even clear he understands grade-school concepts like the separation of powers. He's neither a self-made man nor a particularly successful businessman. He's a fountain of lies and untruths, and he can't read a scripted speech without swerving off into braggadocio. He's a bully, a womanizer, and at least one psychologist--writing for the Atlantic--thinks he suffers from narcissistic personality disorder. Which, given everything we know about Trump's life and career, would make sense. To repeat: If you guessed Donald Trump, you would be correct on the merits. But the answer isn't Trump. It's Barack Obama. This isn't to say those words describe Obama. Just the opposite. But the thing to understand is that depending on where you fall on the American political spectrum, there are two distinct Obamas. The first is the one we know, the president of the United States, liked by most voters and leaving office with a positive approval rating. Democrats respect him for his accomplishments--an economic recovery, a host of new reforms, and a critical expansion of the social safety net--and people around the world hold him in high esteem. He's praised for his oratorical skills, his family life, and his overall temperament. The emerging consensus on his administration is positive, with caveats. It would be fair to say he has been an active and consequential figure in the mainstream of American politics. The other Obama, the second one, doesn't exist as flesh and blood so much as he's a specter--the Dread Obama who haunts right-wing fever dreams. This is the Obama described above, the chief villain in a far-right psychodrama, slammed as a ""race-baiter"" for showing empathy for Trayvon Martin, condemned as a tyrant and a ""Caesar."" The Obama who Donald Trump once suggested was too stupid to attend elite schools. The Obama attacked as feckless and incompetent by right-wing pundits and publications. What makes this so darkly comic is that many of these pundits are behind Trump. The same Todd Starnes who blasted Obama as the ""race-baiter-in-chief"" is willing to back the nativist demagogue if he can stop Hillary Clinton. The same Breitbart that denounced Obama as ""unqualified"" is now a virtual Das Reich for the Trump campaign. The same Newt Gingrich who won the South Carolina primary on teleprompter jokes is now an ardent Trump defender. Vanishingly few, if any, of the claims they've made about Obama are true. Far from some kind of American Morgoth, Obama is a mainstream liberal politician, with mainstream liberal priorities. But everything they've said about Obama is true of Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president. And if Trump becomes president, the boogeyman they've railed against for eight years will be the actual chief executive of the United States of America. You could waste an afternoon speculating about the source of this projection. Why have Republicans elevated a man who stands for everything they claim to hate, who has lived a life of decadence and frivolity they claim to despise? But time is a commodity, and you should live your life. For now, it suffices to say that it's almost hilarious. Almost.

14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/did_nate_silver_actually_get_anything_wrong_about_donald_trump.html	"Ever since Donald Trump locked up the Republican nomination, there has been no shortage of recrimination and mockery directed at political analysts who failed to take his candidacy seriously. No one has taken a bigger beating than FiveThirtyEight editor-in-chief Nate Silver, the famed data journalist whose careful reading of poll numbers in the runup to the previous two presidential elections established him as a lonely voice of rationality and wisdom in a sea of dumb, emotional pundits. Silver did not perform as well during the 2016 GOP primary. As Trump dominated polls last summer and into the fall, Silver and the entire FiveThirtyEight team made it clear that they would not be fooled by the reality star's supposed front-runner status. At one point, Silver said he gave Trump a 2 percent chance to win; elsewhere, he put it at 5 percent. At an event in New York back in September, he told a live audience to ""calm down"" about the prospect of Trump's polls translating into electoral victory. At the end of January, I examined Silver's thought process in an attempt to figure out what he missed. Four months later, with Trump as the presumptive nominee and Silver himself engaged in a process of self-examination, it feels appropriate to ask whether the mistakes he made were avoidable--and whether they were mistakes at all. Is it possible that Silver was correct that Trump's nomination was extremely unlikely? If so, how should we assess his forecast in retrospect, and what should we expect from him as the general election approaches? I recently discussed these questions and others with Washington Post reporter Dave Weigel and University of Wisconsin-Madison mathematics professor and Slate contributor Jordan Ellenberg. Our conversation originally aired as an episode of the Slate Trumpcast. To listen to that podcast, click the player below: Here is a lightly edited transcript of that conversation. Leon Neyfakh: To start, I wanted to engage with what I think is the most elegant and simple argument I've heard from a number of Nate Silver defenders, who say that Nate did not say a Trump domination was impossible, only that it was unlikely, and the fact of Trump's victory does not magically make that wrong. Jordan Ellenberg: I'm definitely supportive of that argument, and I'm strongly in the ""leave Nate Silver alone"" camp on this one. I think somebody who a year ago or even in January thought it was likely that Trump would be the nominee--I think that would have been an incorrect statement at that time, even though it came out being correct. If you buy a lottery ticket and you're sure you're going to win, and you do win, that doesn't make it a good decision in retrospect. Neyfakh: And so, when Nate said Trump had a 5 percent chance to win, you're saying, well, he did have a 5 percent chance, and it just so happened that reality fell within that 5 percent. Ellenberg: Right. I mean, improbable things happen a lot, right? I mean, there are a lot more than 20 things you could ask about in this world, and given that there's a lot of 5 percent chances that are coming through. Neyfakh: Dave, do you buy that? Dave Weigel: The logic of the statement is totally there, but that's not what Nate was doing by saying 5 percent, and that's also not why there's so much glee in the media about him being ""wrong."" The way that Nate phrased this throughout 2015--and really before that, when FiveThirtyEight was starting--he took this tone that journalism that was not data journalism was inherently stupid and wrong. He had statements in all these interviews and was kind of being goaded into doing it, but I think with a little bit of glee at how the 2012 election had gone, saying that a lot of what columnists did was worthless. And when he was analyzing Trump and coming up with these very low probabilities that Trump could win, it was always with a tone that the media was doing everyone a disservice by pretending otherwise. The most infamous headline is, ""Dear Media, Please Stop Freaking Out About Donald Trump's Polls."" And if you're saying people are freaking out, you're implying that they are ignorant about something that's crazy--not that it's unlikely, but it's just not worth worrying about at all. You wouldn't tell somebody, ""Hey, guy in South Florida, stop freaking out about hurricanes!"" You wouldn't say it--like, there may not be one this year, but it's something you should worry about. And I feel like that is why there has been so much glee over him not getting this election right, because the way he got it wrong was so arrogant. Neyfakh: So, Dave, why did Nate Silver think that the polls showing Donald Trump ahead were better off ignored? What was his reason for discounting them? Weigel: I actually think his explanations for this--as he's been humbled into making them--have all been very good and correct. It's that the Republican base as we understood it, with the limited number of elections we had, was not inclined to give someone like this a nomination. It just hadn't recently, even in anger swells that we've seen since Barack Obama was elected president, it didn't tend to reward somebody with all the heresies of Trump just because he was oppositional. This was based on the ""party decides"" thesis and on a lot of other things. It made sense. I think had he just said it's unlikely that Trump will win, I don't think you would have seen quite the same level of mockery. I should say, since Trump started winning, the analysis that he, Harry Enten, and the rest of that team have done of who these voters are has been very good. The problem is, a lot of the media ignore it and just kind of cover Trump as a goofy, point-a-hundred-cameras-at-him phenomenon. The analysis of who actually proved them wrong, I think, has been good and sort of crow-eating, but the analysis of why it could never happen was silly, and I think he's explained that enough by now. Neyfakh: You wrote a piece back in December saying that data journalists--Nate Silver among them--were missing something, that there was this huge story that they were just not taking seriously. So, now that Trump is the presumptive nominee, what do you think he missed? What were his assumptions that turned out to be wrong? Weigel: That article wasn't even about me being right or anyone being wrong about who would win the primary. It was just the binary question of: Who will be president? This guy will, this guy won't, or who will be the nominee? Ellenberg: Well, it was a very nonbinary question this time, which is part of the problem. Weigel: Right, but somebody wins in an election, and somebody loses. So, if all you're interested in is somebody winning the election, then indeed you could ignore a lot of other trends. And I always think of our old colleague, Matt Yglesias, who said this about Romney. He sort of, with a bit of disdain toward how much political media there is, said that if you just ignored all political coverage for the year up to Romney's nomination, you would have assumed Romney wins the nomination because the polls said Romney would win. And you could have done the same with Trump. And the point I was making is just that the worship of predictability or prediction and odds and trends was ignoring this insane phenomenon happening across the country called the Trump movement. It would have led you to ignore the Bernie Sanders movement, too. The formative experience of my reporting life was Ron Paul's campaigns for president, where somebody who never was going to win--and indeed, did not win--ended up moving the direction of the party and creating what looks minor now because Rand Paul, his son, did so poorly, but really did radicalize elements of the party. Before that, I was kind of a history nerd, and I thought Goldwater was interesting--even though he didn't become president--because he radicalized the party. So, I thought that the ""Everyone in the media shut up and stop panicking about this"" argument made by not just Nate, but much less excusably by a lot of replacement-level pundits who didn't even bother to talk to voters and just said we should all ignore these trends--they were missing this huge phenomenon that is changing one of our two political parties into something kind of dark and more like the French National Front than the party we're used to. Ellenberg: Right, but of course it's not Nate Silver's job to tell that story, right? I mean, Silver is not a guy who's going to talk about the meaning of politics. That's not what he's doing. He's there to talk about what's likely to happen and what's not likely to happen. So, I think it's unfair to blame Nate for missing a story that's not on his beat. Weigel: No, and I actually--I come not to bury Nate Silver. Like I said before, he's eaten a lot of crow, and when there is election data to crunch, FiveThirtyEight is very good. It's more the people who then spun off that to say, ""Why is the media spending all of this time on this Trump phenomenon?"" and as a second order on the Bernie phenomenon. It's more when people used the crutch of, well, ""Nate Silver says this,"" to say that the media should cover something less or ignore something, I thought that was the mistake. Neyfakh: But one of the pieces of evidence that Nate used to defend dismissing Trump as a serious candidate or a meaningful movement was that the polls that you might look at as evidence of a movement were unreliable, right? These were preprimary polls, and in the past preprimary polls were not reliable. They didn't really tell you much about what was going to happen when people actually voted. So, that gets me back to this question of: Can we really say--now that Trump is the presumptive nominee--that Nate Silver's assumptions were wrong? Ellenberg: This sort of comes to a deep philosophical point: What do you actually mean when you say there's a 5 percent chance that something's going to happen in the future? And if you really drill down into that, it's rather confusing, right? Because what do you mean when you say there's a 5 percent chance it's going to rain tomorrow? It either is or is not, right? After the fact, either it did or it didn't. What you actually mean--if you drill down into what a meteorologist is doing--is you say, if you look at days that were like today, where the conditions were similar to what they are right now--and if you're a meteorologist, you have thousands and thousands of days like that--you say, in how many of them did it rain the next day? And maybe that's 1 out of 20. Now, sometimes you're in a situation where the conditions that currently obtain just don't really have any comparison. They're really not very much like these particular conditions that have arisen before. And in a context like elections, where you have many fewer data points than you do for weather, that's a much greater danger. Here's the problem if you're Nate Silver. If something truly weird is happening that's kind of unprecedented and doesn't really have a match in previous elections, and you have this website that you run and there's a lot of money and a lot of people are looking at it, I think you can't really say, ""OK, this is different, and we have no idea what's going to happen, and it would be inappropriate to put any numbers on the screen."" As I understand it, he can't actually do that, right? Weigel: I don't think that would be economically advisable, no. But I guess, getting back to what he was saying at the time when he gave that low probability, the ""everybody stop freaking out"" post, the argument was that these early polls are unreliable--which is sometimes true, in terms of the prejudices voters will have going into the actual election--but then he said, well, this percentage of voters supporting Trump represents only a small percentage of voters who will vote overall and a small percentage of Republican primary voters. And it was just kind of this way of saying, you didn't need to worry about a Donald Trump movement because it was a fraction of a fraction of a fraction, based on early polls. That just didn't strike me as correct. Lots of movements that succeed are not majority movements, they just take over politically because they understand the system and overwhelm in the right areas. It was a strange argument about why you should not pay attention, because it seems the reader or watcher of TV would say, gosh, it seems like a lot of people are showing up to hear this guy ramble for an hour about trade and Muslims. And the response from FiveThirtyEight was, yeah, but that's not that many people. That just didn't seem like a good way to cover the election. Neyfakh: What would have been the more responsible or mathematically sound way to interpret what Nate was saying? When he says Trump has a 5 percent chance--this goes back to Jordan's point about the weather--I think for nonstats people like myself, there's something nonintuitive about that. My brain immediately wants to know, 5 percent of what? What information is contained in that forecast, Jordan? Ellenberg: Again, I think this is where it gets complicated. Because you could say that it means under 5 percent of similar situations, the guy who was like Trump won 1 out of 20 times, but there probably aren't enough similar situations for that to really make sense. Probably the best way to think of it is that it's expressing some kind of degree of belief. What I like to do is, there's a site where you can type in the probability and it translates it into baseball terms. In other words, if you type in 5 percent it will be like, OK, a team that is down three runs and batting in the bottom of the eighth wins 5 percent of the time. That's kind of a calibration for your mind if you follow baseball, to say, that's how unlikely it is. Like, if your team is down three in the bottom of the eighth, you haven't given up. You could win. Probably you're not going to win. That's kind of a way of thinking about what a 5 percent probability really means. Neyfakh: I should also note that Nate himself in a podcast the other day talking about this whole thing called back to his quantitative forecast--the 2 percent, the 5 percent. He said: These weren't the results of a model that I built; these were subjective odds that I gave. They were kind of arbitrary. That was a quote, ""kind of arbitrary."" When I heard that I thought to myself, These were predictions expressed as numbers that I interpreted as statistical, in some basic way. But I have a hard time understanding how that's not just punditry. Dave, what do you think? Weigel: I think that question is really only fully answerable by Nate himself, but it certainly sounds like it was just punditry. It was punditry using the chits that he had from things that were not pure punditry, right? He might have felt in his gut four years ago that Florida was more of a Romney state than he predicted, but the data said this and so he went with that. I think it was much more punditry, and I think he's said as much several times. He said this after the British election and the Scottish referendum, where both times he was called to analyze something he honestly didn't know that well. He was looking at that data for the first time, and he apologized for being a pundit, which we know from the rest of his writing is the lowest thing you can be. It's something kind of--it's like the crustacean, something way down the food chain. Pundits are terrible. I think Nate was compelled to make those early predictions about Trump probably for the reason a lot of people who know less about data wanted to underrate Trump. I mean, this was not something I really indulged in, although I think if you had run the election with the same facts a hundred times and in some of those cases Marco Rubio had not muffed it at the New Hampshire debate, it might have been a different primary. I think you still would have had that level of support for Trump, but it might have ended a little bit differently. Who knows? And again, if you were to line up all of the people in a tribunal who got this wrong, I think Nate was not the worst at all. He always caveated, and he always had reasons apart from that one ""media, shut up, stop freaking out"" column. I think the Marvel No-Prize has to go to Nick Kristof, who just imagined a conversation with a Trump voter without talking to one. There are more than 10 million of these people already. I don't think Nick Kristof ... Ellenberg: He didn't even find a cab driver. Aren't you supposed to find a cab driver who's voting for Trump and talk to that guy? Weigel: I don't think Nick Kristof would put up with me if I said, ""Let me imagine a conversation with a Syrian refugee. What's he like? Let me just guess."" There was a lot of that that was much more harmful. Ellenberg: Or what if Nate just started imagining taking polls. I imagined there was a poll. There wasn't one, but you know, it would be good if there was. Weigel: Imagine a housewife who answers a poll question. Imagine the pollster. No, I think he was indulging in punditry there, and I'm just trying to back up and defend him a little bit in saying, OK, well, at worst it just didn't have this patina of science behind it, right? People wanted to believe there was some reason they could ignore Trump or that Trump couldn't happen, and so they said, ""Well, Nate Silver says it."" And no one else had that power. So, I think, like Spider-Man failing to save Uncle Ben, he's using these powers he's been given for something less highfalutin than he could have. Neyfakh: Right, but he said 5 percent. That's a number. And when you hear Nate Silver--the guy who is the king of numbers--tell you that something is 5 percent likely, you're going to interpret that as a formally derived forecast that came from some model. Was it irresponsible for him to use numbers in that way, to sort of dress up what it sounds like we all can agree was roughly punditry in the clothing of statistics? Ellenberg: This is where I feel like it would be super hard to be Nate Silver. I don't know the guy that well, but I sort of think of him as somebody like me. I put myself in his shoes, and I feel like I'm sure he doesn't really want to use hard numbers at a time when nobody's voted and you have these preprimary polls. That's a low-data environment. And yeah, I think in that context there's no choice but to have a lot of guesses built into your model. Even if it's formal, there are a lot of guesses in it. The closer it gets to the election, the more he's going to be able to say, ""This number is meaningful. It comes from something formal."" But I guess I just don't think he has the option to wait. Neyfakh: Because he has a website. Ellenberg: Right. Neyfakh: In the past, Nate and FiveThirtyEight have been really, really good at forecasting general elections--I believe they got every state in 2012. But they were very bad at forecasting Trump in this election, at least sort of in the macro sense. How should we feel about the site and about Nate and about his methods, as they set about forecasting a Trump general election? Ellenberg: I think it's a huge net positive to have this in conjunction with the existing infrastructure of punditry. I think having this kind of methodological diversity is a massive net positive. I think that every single model is based on the idea that conditions now are in some way similar to conditions that have obtained in the past. If that's not true, then I think we should be a lot less confident. Actually, I have a question for Dave: Do you think there's going to be a big ""shy Trump-y"" effect? Are there going to be, systematically, people lying to polls and saying they're not going to vote for Trump when actually they are? Weigel: Well, I want that to be studied, because I feel some of that might have already happened in Maryland and Pennsylvania. Maryland is a good place to look at that example, because George Wallace, when he ran in the 1964 primary, did much better than anyone expected there. The same thing with Wisconsin. Trump has outperformed when the electorate was Republicans and ornery ex-Democrats. That's something that I'd want people with the brain power of Nate Silver et al to wrestle with before we get to the election. I remember this coming up with Barack Obama in 2008. I just saw no evidence based on recent elections with black candidates that there was a ""Bradley effect,"" that people would tell a pollster they were voting for the black guy and not do it. I didn't see that. But the combination of toxic Trump unfavorables and slightly less toxic, maybe just food poisoning-inducing Hillary unfavorables, I think does create this risk there. I should say, Democrats have their own theory, which is that there will be people who tell maybe even their husbands they are going to vote for Trump and then they will come out and vote for Hillary Clinton. So, this is a general election that still very much needs actual data. Ellenberg: The point is that if there are large-scale effects like that, I think they're--Dave, you would know this better than me--but I don't think we've had massive misstatements to pollsters in previous general elections. If that kind of effect is in place in this election, then all bets are off, right? Weigel: No, we often have misinterpreted--by ""we,"" I mean people who are not us--have misinterpreted polls that were kind of wrong about the election as, maybe people lie to pollsters. And what, for example, the victorious Obama campaign in 2012 would say was, no, our data internally said we were going to win by this much. Romney's didn't, because we modeled better than they did and we knew where people were coming out. And that's going to be another tricky thing about this election, because the Hillary campaign has always bet on just grinding this out by getting every single possible Hillary voter to the polls and knowing who they are and what their pets eat for breakfast and everything. And the Trump campaign is going to be, ""I'm Trump. Here's a big rally. Go out and vote for me."" So, it's going to be really hard--harder--to predict on that basis from the Republican side. Ellenberg: I agree. It's going to be harder to figure out based on polls than usual, but I'm just being a pundit when I say that, not a mathematician! Read more of Slate's election coverage."	Did Nate Silver Actually Get Anything Wrong About Donald Trump?
15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/why_obama_is_going_to_hiroshima.html	"This article appears in slightly different form in the Financial Times. In his final year in office, an American president inevitably focuses on his legacy, recasting his accomplishments and making 11th-hour decisions with the potential to outlive him. For Bill Clinton, this meant a torrent of new legislation, national monuments, and trade agreements. For George W. Bush, it was constructing a case that the U.S. had finally turned a corner in his disastrous war in Iraq. It is characteristic of Barack Obama, whose original ambition of constructive dialogue with Republicans was so decisively thwarted, that the theme of his last stretch as president should be reconciliation. Instead of making peace with the Republicans, which proved impossible, he has turned his hand to resolving longstanding conflicts with other countries; his final sprint has included restoring relations with Iran and with Cuba, which had been severed since 1980 and 1961, respectively. Obama's visit to Hiroshima this month will open another door, one that has remained closed since 1945. His critics have been quick to decry the visit as another stop on what they call his ""global apology tour."" This is a doubly bogus idea--first because Obama has not been an especially prolific apologist, and second because of the premise that the U.S. never has anything to apologize for. In fact, the president has been doing something far more interesting than regretting past American misdeeds. He has been trying to construct bridges across troubled waters. Benjamin Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser, has made clear that the Hiroshima visit will not feature any apologies. But merely visiting the city's Memorial Peace Park with Shinzo Abe, the prime minister of Japan, will challenge a powerful American taboo. In 1995, the Smithsonian Institution attempted to mount an exhibition around the Enola Gay, the B-29 Superfortress that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. The National Air and Space Museum planned to feature photographs and oral histories from victims and survivors. Under pressure from veterans' groups that thought the exhibition too sympathetic to the Japanese, the museum first sanitized then canceled it. Newt Gingrich, then the speaker of the House of Representatives and now bidding to become Donald Trump's presidential running mate, charged that Americans were ""sick and tired of being told by some cultural elite that they ought to be ashamed of their country."" The director of the museum was forced to resign amid the furor. Among historians the debate about the use of nuclear weapons against the Japanese has remained very much alive. Why did President Harry Truman decide to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing more than 200,000 people? And was he justified in doing so? Gar Alperovitz, a left-wing scholar, has long argued that the bombs were unnecessary to end the war in the Pacific, and that Truman knew it. Alperovitz believes the bombs were intended as a demonstration to the Soviet Union of U.S. capability at the dawn of the Cold War. Even some of those who defend Truman's decision acknowledge that use of a weapon of mass destruction against civilian populations is a war crime. Others point out that Japanese hardliners opposed surrender even after Nagasaki, and that dropping the atomic bombs was ultimately a humanitarian act. By ending the war the U.S. probably saved many more lives than it destroyed, including those of war-weary American soldiers deployed on Okinawa in preparation for Operation Downfall, innumerable Japanese soldiers and civilians trained to die for the emperor in an apocalyptic last battle, and victims of the barbaric Japanese occupation throughout Asia. Without Emperor Hirohito's capitulation after the second bomb was dropped, grotesque suffering might have continued for many more months. Obama's purpose is not to challenge this patriotically correct narrative, or affirm a politically correct one, or to reconsider Truman's choice. He understands that an American president cannot and should not try to adjudicate on this kind of historical debate. Rather, his focus is on opening an impassable topic as a necessary adjunct to addressing contemporary issues. The president hopes that acknowledging the horror that took place at the dawn of the nuclear age will spur the conversation he wants to have about nuclear proliferation and disarmament in the 21st century. He aspires to serve as a conciliator on the painful history that still divides the U.S. from its most important Asian ally. There remains plenty of history that even Obama dare not reopen. In deference to Turkey, he has declined to use the term genocide to describe the massacre of Armenians in 1915. In 2014, he acknowledged that ""we tortured some folks"" during his predecessor's administration. But he has stopped short of holding accountable those who chose torture as a policy during the Bush years. Obama's historical bravery is admirable. It also remains subject to clear political limits."	Why Obama Is Going to Hiroshima
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/donald_trump_is_selling_out_and_his_supporters_don_t_care.html	"Donald Trump, as predicted, has begun to distance himself from some of the positions and postures that catapulted him to the Republican presidential nomination. This is always to be expected of general election candidates once they've clinched the nomination, but Trump's shifts are special because the original stances were so far outside the norm of politics as usual--often for ill. Despite issuing a tax plan that's largely a giveaway to the rich, Trump had at least once or twice entertained the idea of closing a tax loophole or two that certain wealthy people exploit. He has now brought on two supply-side celebrities, Larry Kudlow and Stephen Moore, to scrub the plan of anything not ludicrously beneficial to the wealthiest people on Earth. To preserve all of those preferential tax treatments, alas, it looks like Social Security and Medicare will have to get all chopped up after all. That Muslim ban that roughly 7 in 10 Republican primary voters loved? Eh, just a ""suggestion."" He's having Rudy Giuliani take a look at it along with his border security plan. Then there's the meta-issue that undergirded his ability to take all of those unorthodox positions in the first place: the self-funding--well, self-loaning--of his candidacy, which will now cease because of the demands of funding a general election campaign. What we are seeing in Trump's new solicitation of big bucks--and his new positioning--is a validation of what he was saying about how politicians are bought and paid for by wealthy interests. In the primary, Trump was able to entertain both the light side of populism (preserving large social insurance programs, raising a tax or two on the wealthy) and the dark side (nativism) because he did not rely on contributions from elite Republican donors. Those heresies will have to be reined in now that he needs some scratch. ""By self-funding my campaign,"" Trump said in a typical line last September, ""I am not controlled by my donors, special interests or lobbyists. I am only working for the people of the U.S.!"" That Donald Trump would look at nominee Donald Trump as a proto-Jeb Bush. His own transition is testament to the truth of his original message. Now: Does any of this mean he will lose the core supporters who gravitated to his original message? No! That would be a violation of the simple rule that Trump does not lose his core supporters over anything. At this point he and those supporters are bonded on an emotional level, which is how the whole personality cult thing works. They just like the guy: like how he speaks, like who he is, like how he irritates and threatens people they don't like. Reuters, for example, asked 40 Trump supporters if they cared that Trump would now follow a traditional fundraising model, and all but four said they ""were not concerned."" This makes sense to anyone who has ever presented any uncomfortable fact to Trump supporters and found that they ""were not concerned."" Plus, Trump supporters have a legitimate justification for allowing him to slide on this: They hate Hillary Clinton, who is going to spend north of $1 billion trying to defeat Trump. ""You gotta fight fire with fire,"" a cattle rancher from North Dakota tells Reuters. ""Bring it on."" The opportunity to beat up on Clinton has closed some chasmic rifts within the Republican coalition over the last 25 years. The question for Trump's campaign is whether he has the ability to add voters to his coalition. That was never going to be easy, but he had at least settled on potent branding for his new opponent: ""Crooked Hillary."" Not clever, but perfect, tying together the FBI investigation over Clinton's email server, her connections to special interests, and the general societal impression that she is a fraud. That's where Trump's turn to fundraising is most damaging: It blunts the effectiveness of his strongest message against Clinton in terms of appealing to swayable voters who hate politics as usual. He won't lose the voters he's had all along, but it's going to be harder to convince new ones that she's just another donor-owned crook now that he, too, will be a donor-owned crook. It will be less potent when he calls Clinton a stooge of Goldman Sachs--a powerful and not-untrue accusation!--if she can respond that he, too, accepts money from the same or similar institutions. Trump's turn to fundraising sticks him in a box of conventionality, when unconventionality was both the greatest risk for his candidacy and what made him so fresh to begin with.

17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/gop_voters_who_don_t_like_trump_on_who_they_will_vote_for.html	"Back in early March, I went looking for GOP voters who didn't love Donald Trump. This was not a scientific undertaking--my sample size was 13 people, found through my own social and professional networks. I just wanted a glimpse of the thought process of longtime Republicans who were uncomfortable making Trump their party's nominee. How did they plan to vote in November, should Trump in fact make the ballot versus Hillary Clinton? At the time, when Trump had won New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada but was not yet a lock, two of them said they'd vote Trump in the fall; five said they'd vote for Hillary; and six were on the fence, planned to sit out, vote third-party, or write someone else in. This week, I checked back with these same voters. Now that Trump has indeed become the presumptive GOP nominee, I wondered: Would these folks fall in line, given that Trump has the party's imprimatur? Would any be pushed further toward Hillary or a third-party candidate? Here's what I found. Who: civil litigation attorney, male, 45, California
Voting background: has always voted GOP in previous presidential elections
What he said he'd do in March if Trump became the nominee: probably vote for Trump
What he says now: 80-90 percent sure he can't vote for Trump under any circumstances
Change of heart: yes The reality of the apparent Trump nomination has me dispirited. I am 80-90 percent sure that I cannot vote for Trump under any circumstances, even if he put a solid conservative on the ticket, a result that I don't anticipate. While he may be slightly better than Hillary on a number of issues, he is unpredictable and unmoored. I guess I would rather have a predictable and reliable adversary than an unpredictable and unreliable leader. I find him temperamentally unsuited for the presidency. The man is an ass. I enjoy him for entertainment value, but this is serious business, and he is not a serious man. One keeps waiting for him to be more presidential, to say, ""OK, the fun and games are over, but I'm a serious guy who understands this is a big deal."" I get no sense of that from him. I am looking at voting for Gov. Gary Johnson [who will likely top the Libertarian ticket]. If an independent Republican or conservative ran, I would likely vote for that person even though I don't support drafting such a candidate. * * * Who: retired attorney, male, 74, California
 Voting background: has voted GOP since Barry Goldwater, with one break for Ross Perot in 1992
 What he said he'd do in March if Trump became the nominee: vote for Trump
What he says now: vote for Trump
Change of heart: no I'm in pretty much the same place, although I will confess that the recent Bret Stephens piece in the Wall Street Journal made me say, ""Hmmmmm."" I will also say that there is much time and opportunity for external matters (the economy, China and the Pacific, Putin, ISIS, etc.) as well as the candidates to make significant changes. Heck, maybe my son and daughter-in-law could even convince me that they are right and I am wrong. But to answer the question, I still think (note well: think, not feel) that Hillary is not worthy or trustworthy, and I'd rather roll the Trump dice. * * * Who: federal HR employee, female, 40, Kentucky
 Voting background: has voted GOP in every previous presidential election
 What she said she'd do in March if Trump became the nominee: vote for Hillary
What she says now: even more likely to vote for Hillary
Change of heart: no Trump sickens me even more now than when you first asked me. I was on a business trip with a Trump fan who told me, ""I just think he's funny. I love that he says exactly what he thinks! I just want to see how much he can get away with!"" As if it was all a big joke, pure entertainment. It is terrifying. I don't see how any thinking person could be anything but insulted by his candidacy. Also, my husband is in the Army. The thought of Trump as his commander in chief terrifies me. I think I first started to despise Trump when he belittled John McCain. Hillary isn't my first choice to lead the military, but she is the best of bad options. Again, at least I feel like she would engage in critical thinking before taking action. On the Hillary side, I would say that my support is solidifying. I could still be tempted by [Mitt] Romney or [Paul] Ryan, but Hillary is close enough to the middle for me to be comfortable. Her detailed plans appeal to me. Even when I disagree with her, I feel like she has put enough thought into her opinion for me to respect it. I also see her as someone who can keep all the plates in the air. Finally, I am really ready to vote for a woman. I know it is a weird thing to be so affected by, but Trump's rant about the ""woman card"" really pissed me off. Even as a relatively young woman, I've had to fight for credibility and equal opportunities. Hillary went through worse. Hearing Trump make his stupid, sneering remarks made my blood boil. Hillary has put in the time and effort to earn my vote. So, yeah, firmly in Hillary's camp now. * * * Who: business owner and CEO, male, 44, Washington, D.C.
 Voting background: has always voted GOP in presidential elections, save for a libertarian vote in 2004
 What he said he'd do in March if Trump became the nominee: pray
What he says now: not vote
Change of heart: not really Trump has done nothing to disabuse me of the sentiments I formed months ago. And Hillary will always be Hillary: fundamentally untrustworthy. Short of a Romney third-party candidacy, I will likely just not vote. And I will take some pleasure in watching Trump come apart at the seams this fall. Hillary is miserable, but she'd at least preserve the republic for a [Marco] Rubio or Ryan to inherit in 2020. * * * Who: retired attorney, female, 52, California
 Voting background: has always voted GOP in presidential elections but abstained in 2008
 What she said she'd do in March if Trump became the nominee: probably not vote, possibly vote for Hillary.
What she says now: vote for Gary Johnson or not vote at all
Change of heart: not really I remain as baffled and appalled as ever. If the California general election ballot looks the way I think it will, I will probably vote for Gary Johnson or just not vote the top of the ticket. * * * Who: attorney, female, 39, Virginia
 Voting background: has always voted GOP in presidential elections, save for a libertarian vote in 2000
 What she said she'd do in March if Trump became the nominee: not vote
What she says now: might vote for Sen. Ben Sasse or might not vote
Change of heart: no My feelings about Trump haven't changed. I have always planned to go to the polls in November to cast my ballot to support re-election of my Republican congresswoman, but I am still not sure which, if any, vote I might cast for the presidential race. Over the past month as Trump's nomination started to look inevitable, I have seen a lot of my friends declare on Facebook that they are no longer Republicans. I've essentially been crying out to them, ""No, don't leave! There's a lot more to it than the presidential nomination! We can't just drop out and let the mobs take over!"" That's why I'm convinced we need someone to rally around so those of us who lean right but are deeply unsettled by the Trump phenomenon (and all that gave rise to it) don't feel completely voiceless and powerless and give up on political engagement. I like the talk I'm hearing of Sen. Ben Sasse potentially running as an independent (or however he might be designated on the ballot). I think there needs to be an additional incentive for conservatives who identify as #NeverTrump to go to the polls to vote for the Senate and House races. I would support him running for this reason. I think Hillary's election is pretty much inevitable at this point, and unlike Trump at least she's predictable and pragmatic, so it doesn't deter me knowing an independent run has almost no chance of actually winning the presidency. I'm most concerned about holding the Senate GOP majority at this point, to check and balance her. That's how the Constitution designed our government to be, after all. * * * Who: retired executive, male, 75, New Jersey
 Voting background: has always voted GOP in previous presidential elections
 What he said he'd do in March if Trump became the nominee: vote for Hillary
What he says now: vote for Hillary
Change of heart: no My Trump revulsion factor has actually gone up quite a bit since March. I was looking for discussion on policies and programs to solve issues facing the U.S. But Trump has spent his time attacking individuals, groups, and even nations without spending a minute on solutions below the 50,000-foot level. I tuned him out. Hillary has the qualifications and experience, and I will comfortably cast my first-ever Democratic vote for her in the general election. Maybe the Republican Party will wake up if the loss is large enough. Probably not. * * * Who: stay-at-home parent, female, 38, Virginia
 Voting background: has voted GOP in every presidential election
 What she said she'd do in March if Trump became the nominee: write in a different candidate
What she says now: write in someone or leave her ballot blank
Change of heart: no Nothing has changed for me, except for my growing disdain for both candidates. I'm hoping that a third-party candidate emerges. I don't have my eye on anyone--I'm waiting to see who comes out, and I'm hoping and expecting it to be better than the presumptive nominees at this point. I'll still vote the down ballot and might leave the presidential slot empty. It's an ugly place to be, as someone involved in politics who pays attention and cares about the outcome, but I can't bring myself to vote for either of these two candidates. Any opportunity that Trump is given to show his character and extend his hand to conservatives and other people for whom he has not been their first choice he just throws it in their faces and says, ""I don't need them anyway. I don't care about them anyway."" He's very dismissive. That kind of attitude, I can't appreciate it. It makes me angry. * * * Who: attorney, male, 33, Illinois
 Voting background: has voted GOP in every previous presidential election
 What he said he'd do in March if Trump became the nominee: vote for Hillary
What he says now: vote for Hillary
Change of heart: no I'm still definitely with Hillary and will never vote for Trump. I guess if Hillary is going to demolish Trump (say, more than 10 percent but maybe even 20 percent), I'd vote for Gary Johnson if he gets the libertarian nod. If there's even a remote risk Trump might be president, I'll vote for Hillary. I think my view of Hillary has improved slightly, but that's probably due to the fact that I'm supporting her now, and the people left in the race are so horrendous. I expect she'll do a job similar to Obama, which I can live with. If Hillary effectively tacks to the center, I could see myself voting for her and not Johnson even if she's winning by 20 points. Trump's views on monetary policy, changing libel laws, and encouraging violence from his supporters has hardened my opposition (if that was possible). I think Hillary looks better in light of a [Bernie] Sanders campaign that's become increasingly negative and in light of some Sanders supporters (not all) that have become more unhinged. The calls on Hillary to drop out because of criminal activity at the State Department (which I thought were bogus when they came from the right) are particularly disturbing. * * * Who: tech worker, male, 39, Ohio
 Voting background: has voted GOP in every previous presidential election
 What he said he'd do in March if Trump became the nominee: not vote
What he says now: maybe vote Libertarian
Change of heart: not really I gave $100 to the Libertarian candidate Austin Petersen. Nothing has changed about my opinions on Hillary or Trump. Trump taking over the GOP is like Germany invading and occupying France in World War II. Those who support him are collaborators or ""Vichy Republicans."" The rest of us are free Republicans in exile. We will liberate the party some day. Just not sure when. * * * Who: stay-at-home parent, female, 31, Massachusetts
Voting background: has voted GOP in every previous presidential election
What she said she'd do in March if Trump became the nominee: vote for Hillary
What she says now: vote for Hillary
Change of heart: no I pretty much checked out of the election two months ago. I saw it as a no-win situation. All the candidates are horrible. Hillary is a liar and a pretty horrible human being, but I believe that for the most part, the reasons I don't like her are because she made tough decisions and did what she thought was best, even though it meant people weren't going to like it. However, I feel like she is the best option to continue with the status quo. She has the experience necessary with foreign leaders. Right now she's the lesser of two evils and the least likely to propel us into World War III. I don't see how the nation can benefit from someone like Trump, who is so oblivious and ignorant, in office. Also, this is all I can think of when I consider the election: * * * Who: financial adviser, male, 30, Florida
 Voting background: has voted GOP in every previous presidential election
 What he said he'd do in March if Trump became the nominee: vote for Hillary
What he says now: vote for Hillary
Change of heart: no Nothing has really changed. I'm voting for Hillary in all likelihood. I hope she moves to the middle and paints herself as a get-something-done-pragmatist (we'll see). I would not vote third-party unless it was Sanders versus Trump. I have spent the last few months arguing the merits of socialism, which I find as ridiculous as Trump's entire candidacy. All I can say is that this is a very dumb country. I pray that Hillary wins, and a Republican who supports free trade can beat her in four years. * * * Who: consultant, male, 63, Florida
 Voting background: has always voted GOP in previous presidential elections
 What he said he'd do in March if Trump became the nominee: probably vote for Trump ... or wait, change that, Hillary
What he says now: still on the fence
Change of heart: hard to tell With Hillary and Trump, it's a tie with me right now. I find them both to be unacceptable. I'm going to take my responsibility seriously and vote for one, but it'll be a game-time decision. My concerns about Trump right now have less to do with his boorish behavior and more about his stated positions on debt, monetary policy, immigration, and so forth. But so far, I haven't seen or heard anything from Trump that I would regard as coherent policy--45 percent duty on Chinese goods, deport millions of people, reduce our presence in NATO, give a haircut to U.S. bondholders. He has shown no grasp of economic or foreign policy. I guess if I had to vote today, I'd vote for Hillary. But that's just a real close call. I think she's unqualified based on character and past behavior. To some extent, the running mates might have something to do with my ultimate decision. It's entertaining--that's the only redeeming thing about this whole process."	Checking Back in With Our Panel of GOP Voters Who Don't Like Trump to See Where They Stand Today
18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/how_to_stop_the_next_trump.html	"Say it's Wednesday, Nov. 9, and Hillary Clinton, a very unpopular politician, has just defeated Donald Trump, a historically unpopular politician, by a safe popular-vote margin and a landslide Electoral College tally. This is by no means a foregone conclusion, but it is a distinct possibility. And say you're the people who run the Republican Party: Republican National Committee officials, state party leaders, and so forth. You saw this coming a mile away, and you want to make sure that this--your primary electorate selecting an agonizingly unelectable candidate as your nominee in an election you should've won--never happens again. What could you do? One answer that comes to mind is to stop working your base into a destructive, nativist froth over every little thing while somehow expecting it not to reflect that insanity in its presidential primary selection. But this is exceedingly unlikely. No, the less honest and therefore more plausible path is just to keep the insanity machine humming while tweaking the nominating rules to produce a nonhumiliating national candidate for the general election. This is a balancing act that the GOP improbably had been able to pull off until this cycle. Trump's nomination represents the fulfillment of the disaster scenario bruited after the post-1968 primary reforms that granted voters a more direct role in selecting their nominees. The fear was that voters would be empowered to choose an incompetent and unelectable boob over the wishes of the party, and that the party would have no recourse when they did. Nearly half a century later, Republican voters have their boob and the GOP has no recourse--at least, not for this election. But if Trump loses in the way some are predicting, we shouldn't be surprised to see party elders propose a set of compensatory primary reforms designed to neutralize any future Trumps. One idea would be to move in the Democratic Party's direction: toward a uniform sequence of proportionally allocated contests. Although Trump complained about the rules being ""rigged"" against him following his shutout at the Colorado conventions, the Republican nominating rules on the whole were beneficial to him. Until his romp through the Northeast, Trump had been unable to reach 50 percent in any state and typically unable to hit 40 percent. Winner-take-all or winner-take-most rules nevertheless allowed him to capture either all or most of the delegates in those states in which he won slim pluralities, as in Illinois or Missouri. Had each state followed pure proportional allocation, anti-Trump forces may well have kept Trump beneath a delegate majority and forced a contested convention. But Republicans aren't predisposed either to top-down solutions or--with some state exceptions--proportional allocations. And neither would solve the root problem for the party of how a strong plurality of voters selected a toxic figure over any number of more viable candidates. It's not an accident that Democrats have a system of uniform proportional representation while Republicans have a patchwork system of individual state rules, many of them winner-take-most or winner-take-all. It is related to the different cultures of the two parties--or, frankly, the stereotypes about them that happen to be true. Democratic reformers in the 1970s really were of the mind that everyone should get a participation trophy. Following the 1968 convention debacle and over the course of several centrally run commissions beginning with McGovern-Fraser, Democratic reformers pushed to open the nominating process to more people. This led both to more delegates being selected by primary and to uniform proportional allocation rules to ensure that each faction of the party, as represented by individual candidates, could take some delegates so long as the candidate topped a certain minimum threshold. Following the nominations of George McGovern in 1972 and Jimmy Carter in 1976, the party restored some order of party control by reserving delegate slots for free-agent ""superdelegates,"" or leaders who could cool the passions of primary voters if needed. So far, Democratic superdelegates have never overturned the will of primary voters. Republicans gradually adopted certain reforms to bind delegate selection to primary voters' candidate preferences but were loath to institute uniform national rules, preferring instead to leave delegate allocation to the states on the principle of states' rights. And though some Republican state parties allocate proportionally, Republicans have a disdain for proportional allocation because, as Brookings scholar Elaine Kamarck writes in her book Primary Politics: Everything You Need to Know About How American Nominates its Presidential Candidates, they want ""the nominating system to mirror the winner-take-all aspects of the general election and the Electoral College."" Even if the Republicans did have a system like the Democrats' this cycle, though, how would that have stopped Donald Trump without tearing the party apart? Say Trump went into the convention with 40 or 45 percent of the delegates he needed to clinch the nomination, well above the figures Ted Cruz, John Kasich or Marco Rubio had. And then say the Republican Party had superdelegates who voted en bloc to deny him from hitting a majority. Would that not still effectively count as the will of the voters being denied? Before Trump had wrapped up the nomination this cycle, after all, polls showed that sizable majorities of Republicans believed the plurality delegate leader should be the nominee. (And yes: If Democratic leaders ever have to pull the superdelegate trigger against a pledged delegate leader they consider unviable, they will be in crisis, too.) It's very hard to overturn the will of the people so long as there's a will of the people, assuming parties have an interest in not lighting themselves on fire. Another answer for the Republicans moving forward, then, would be to muddy what the ""will of the people"" really is. In other words: for more state parties to eliminate their presidential-preference votes altogether. ""There will definitely be some serious activity [on a state-by-state level] if, as predicted, Trump gets beat in a landslide and he takes a lot of Republicans with him,"" Kamarck--who is also a Democratic superdelegate--tells Slate in an interview. ""That's the sort of nuclear scenario that would definitely lead to some real changes."" Kamarck sees the solution as moving away from presidential-preference votes and toward selection of unbound delegates--i.e., back to how the system worked for most of American history. So long as there are direct presidential-preference votes, people are going to expect those votes to be honored, which is why overturning voters' will at the convention is such a nonstarter. ""What you can't do is keep having primaries, and then not have the delegates reflect the primaries,"" Kamarck says. ""But what you can do is you can simply get rid of the preference vote, which basically was the system from 1831 to 1968."" Eliminating presidential-preference votes eliminates delegate binding, and not just in the theoretical sense that delegates should in some way feel bound to reflect the preferences of the voters they represent. A Republican rule change this cycle bound delegates to presidential-preference votes, so some states that held nonbinding presidential-preference caucuses in 2012, like Minnesota and Colorado, were not allowed to do so in 2016. Minnesota decided to keep its presidential-preference caucuses and thus its delegation was bound. Colorado, however, eliminated the presidential-preference portion of its caucuses altogether and instead just selected delegates to district and state conventions. Members of the state's RNC delegation chosen at district- and state-level conventions were allowed to remain unbound unless they signed a pledge during the process to support a certain candidate (which, at least this time, they did.) In the rubble of Trump's loss, more state parties--at least those interested in eventually winning the presidency for their party--would be tempted to eschew their candidate-preference votes and move toward emphasizing delegate selection. ""The thing that makes the voters mad,"" Kamarck says, ""is they vote in a primary and they're led to believe their vote's going to matter. ... But if you have a system that has no 'beauty contest'--no presidential preference--then the voters can't be disappointed."" If you were designing a system from scratch, maybe. Voters can and will be disappointed if the system moves backward to an era when they had less power. (See, again, the complaints about how ""rigged"" Colorado held no presidential-preference vote.) What Kamarck is describing--even if it puts more power in the hands of delegates who are inclined to support a more seaworthy candidate--would roll back principles of direct democracy. It wouldn't take away anyone's ""rights,"" since parties are not public bodies and can more or less choose their presidential candidates however they want. But it would take away what voters have come to see as their rights, and it's very hard to stuff that cat back in the bag if you still want people to belong to your party. The parties may have had a less direct system of selecting nominees for most of the country's history prior to 1968. But it did change after 1968, and there were principled reasons for it--even if 2016 drew out the nightmare scenario that reformers had been warned about. The inescapable truth is, there really is no easy rules tweak available to prevent another Trump from hijacking the party. Maybe nibbling at the edges of the problem won't work. Maybe the only way to prevent the nomination of another unpalatable demagogue really is to stop working the base into a destructive, nativist froth over every little thing. A long shot, we know. But political parties exist to perpetuate themselves. Eventually, everyone gets sick of losing, and the people in charge do something about it. Read more Slate coverage of the Republican primary."	How to Stop the Next Trump
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/a_trumpsplainer_on_what_the_gop_candidate_s_voters_are_thinking_when_they.html	"A little while ago, Slate's Isaac Chotiner pointed to one of the ways that conservative entertainers like Bill O'Reilly of Fox News have aided Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Rather than defend Trump's more outlandish remarks--like claiming that Ted Cruz's father was involved in the plot to assassinate John F. Kennedy--O'Reilly and his ilk seek to explain them. In doing so, Chotiner argues, they've helped normalize his extreme behavior and made it seem palatable to a large segment of the electorate. I see his point. Nevertheless, I've found myself doing a fair bit of Trumpsplaining over the past few months, both in my writing and in conversations with friends and relatives. This is not because I support his candidacy--I do not--or because I want to legitimize Trump's wild-man shtick. I Trumpsplain because millions of voters have embraced his campaign, and I want to understand why. Why are Trump's Republican supporters willing to overlook his many ideological heresies, on issues ranging from abortion to socialized medicine to Israel? Why are they so indifferent to his many flip-flops? I have a working hypothesis. The short version of my Trumpsplainer: Many conservatives believe first and foremost in the importance of keeping Americans safe, and Trump has emerged as their candidate. This thought first occurred to me late last year. Back in December, the Democratic-leaning Public Policy Polling played a trick on Trump voters, asking them if they'd favor bombing Agrabah, the fictional setting of the animated film Aladdin. Forty-one percent of them said that yes, they would favor bombing Agrabah, while only 9 percent took a definitive stand against doing so. The share of Republicans overall who favored bombing Agrabah was 30 percent. Rather than take PPP's poll-trolling lying down, WPA Research, a conservative firm, asked Democrats if they'd support the resettlement of refugees from Agrabah in the United States. Lo and behold, 44 percent said they'd support resettlement while 27 percent said they'd oppose it. Among Democrats aged 18 to 34, support for welcoming these fictional refugees was 66 percent. In a press release announcing this result, WPA Research explicitly contrasted their finding with PPP's: ""PPP may have proven that some Republicans will support bombing a fictional country, but fully 44 percent of Democrats will allow refugees from anywhere into the country, whether they are potential ISIS supporters from Syria or potential cartoon characters on a magic carpet ride."" So, what did we learn from this frankly quite stupid exercise? Several acquaintances of mine told me that these polls revealed that the first instinct of many Trump supporters was to kill strangers, while that of many Democrats was to welcome them. I'd argue that there is a bit more to it. Yes, those who support bombing Agrabah are willing to inflict pain and suffering on foreigners they know nothing about. But they're willing to do so because they believe that it will make Americans safer. And to them, keeping Americans safe is more important than anything else. Those who want to resettle refugees from Agrabah, meanwhile, care enough about helping foreigners about whom they're completely ignorant and are willing to live with the possibility that a few radicals might enter the country and threaten the lives of Americans. If we have to sacrifice some degree of safety to do the right thing, so be it. If our goal, then, is to persuade the bomb-Agrabah voters to give peace a chance, we'd have to make the case that bombing Agrabah will not in fact make Americans safer. If our goal is to make the case against welcoming refugees from Agrabah, we'd have to establish that there are morally acceptable alternatives to doing so, like helping the people who are fleeing Agrabah to find refuge closer to home. These dueling polls, silly as they may seem on the surface, actually tell us a lot about Trump's appeal. Byron York, a columnist for the Washington Examiner, observes that in the biggest GOP primary contests, large majorities of Republican voters have supported ""temporarily banning Muslims who are not U.S. citizens from entering the U.S."" Support for a Muslim ban among Republicans far surpasses support for mass deportation, and it is closely correlated with support for Trump. One straightforward interpretation of these high levels of support for a Muslim ban is that there are more bigots out there than many of us had assumed. The Trumpsplainer in me sees things differently. Donald Trump's call for a Muslim ban came in the context of a larger debate over the resettlement of Syrian refugees and of Muslim immigration more broadly. In March, I argued that this debate has been based on faulty premises. On one side, you have people who maintain that Muslim immigrants represent a threat to Western democracies. On the other side are those who argue that Muslim immigrants pose no threat--that racism and a failure to provide immigrants with the resources they need can lead to the alienation of the children of Muslim immigrants, some of whom might then embrace radical ideologies. What this debate has so far neglected is the possibility that both sides are right: Muslim immigration does pose a long-term threat to Western democracies, because citizens of Western democracies are unwilling to devote the resources necessary to integrate Muslim immigrants and their children. More recently, Claire L. Adida, David D. Laitin, and Marie-Anne Valfort offered a sobering look at the place of Muslims in Western democracies. Drawing on the experiences of Christian and Muslim immigrants from Senegal, they found that the Muslims faced greater discrimination while also expressing more attachment to their country of origin and less to their host country than their Christian counterparts. Moreover, they observe that these patterns don't meaningfully improve from one generation to the next. ""As a result,"" they wrote in Foreign Affairs, ""Europe is creating a class of under-employed immigrants who feel little or no connection with their host societies."" So far, everything that Adida, Laitin, and Valfort argue resonates with my own understanding: Muslims often struggle to integrate into Western democracies, both because they face discrimination and because they are reluctant to embrace the culture of their host countries. These two forces can be self-reinforcing. If I'm not embraced by my host society, I might cling all the more tightly to my native culture, and I might grow to resent the foreigners around me. One takeaway from this analysis is that it makes sense for the citizens of Western democracies to be cautious and deliberate with respect to large-scale Muslim immigration, at least until we learn more about what it takes to make integration work. But that is not the conclusion Adida et al. draw. After exhaustively detailing the many ways efforts to integrate Muslim immigrants into Western democracies have failed, they don't propose taking a step back and acknowledging that these efforts are likely to prove expensive and difficult and that we might want to welcome smaller numbers of Muslim immigrants in the future. Instead, they make the opposite argument, calling for doubling down on anti-discrimination efforts and for a transformation of social norms around gender within Muslim communities. (Suffice it to say, transforming gender norms is not the easiest thing in the world to do.) They insist that the one thing Western democracies must not do is ban Muslim immigration, as doing so will alienate Muslims and make it harder for them to integrate. To some liberals, it is obvious that Western democracies ought to welcome as many traumatized Muslims as possible, even if that means accepting that some small number of second-generation Muslims might embrace violent jihadism. Those who oppose this approach are, according to this line of thinking, blaming the victim, because the vast majority of Muslims pose no threat. My sense is that Trump supporters believe in a different principle: better safe than sorry. Sure, most Muslim immigrants are fine people who pose no threat. But some of them might pose a threat. Moreover, there is no guarantee that spending large sums of money and promoting tolerance will prevent every second-generation Muslim from feeling alienated, because most people are partial to those who are similar to them and at least mildly suspicious of those who are different. Why take any chances? Those who embrace safety-first conservatism don't care all that much about whether doing what it takes to be safe means violating some universal moral principle or whether they're blaming the victim. They care about keeping themselves, their families, and the members of their national community safe. They see liberals as dangerously naive. Calling out Trump for his appeals to racial and ethnic resentment, or his ignorance of policy detail, won't dissuade them from supporting him, because they believe that for all his faults, he understands their fears in a way that other politicians simply do not."	What Trump Voters Are Thinking When They Support a Ban on Muslim Immigration
20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/donald_trump_can_t_pivot.html	"Thus far, in the narrative of the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump is the ""unpredictable"" one who will scramble the fall election. What this means in practice is that everything Trump says feeds the narrative, even if, after the most cursory examination, it doesn't fit. And so Monday, for example, we're told the wily Trump has shifted positions on taxes and the minimum wage, craftily moving toward Hillary Clinton's left ahead of the general. But the truth is that this just isn't clear. Trump made his comments on Sunday on two shows, ABC's This Week and NBC's Meet the Press. On the former, Trump said he was ""looking"" at the minimum wage and that ""people have to get more""; on the latter, he disagreed that the federal government should set a floor for the minimum wage and told host Chuck Todd that he would, in a standard bit of conservative code, ""rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide."" On taxes, he told ABC that he would negotiate with Congress and taxes on the rich will ""go up a little bit,"" asserting that the ""wealthy are willing to pay more"" and adding that ""I have a feeling we may pay some more."" Later, on NBC, he clarified his position, telling Todd that taxes might have to go up relative to his proposal, which slashes tax rates for the highest earners. Writing for the Washington Post, Greg Sargent correctly (and with some exasperation) notes that these are barely policies or proposals. They're just vague statements--hand waving in lieu of detail to questions Trump can't actually answer. ""Taken on its own terms,"" writes Sargent about Trump's comments on taxes, ""it is a declaration about what the wealthy want to do of their own accord, and merely a 'feeling' that something 'may' happen in terms of policy to make it so."" And yet, here we are, examining Trump's ""shift,"" marking it as another example of his chameleonlike politics. But there's a problem. Even if Trump has changed his position on taxes and the minimum wage--and as of Monday, he denies he's done either--it isn't really a ""pivot"" or an ""Etch A Sketch"" or whatever metaphor is favored by pundits to describe the move to the general election. Insofar as these moves actually matter, it's because they represent a shift from core commitments, or at least their de-emphasis. In the 2012 Republican primary, Mitt Romney ran as a merciless executor of conservative priorities, but in the general, he remade himself as a moderate champion of the middle class, which forced him to downplay key elements of his policy platform, like large upper-income tax cuts. For Trump, both tax cuts and the minimum wage are beside the point. They weren't the focus of his campaign or the reason he won support from a decisive plurality of Republican primary voters. Trump, in fact, has never shown any commitment to conservative spending policies. (It's why House speaker and leading Republican ideologue Paul Ryan is reluctant to back him for the White House.) If he's jettisoned them, it's not because he's a political shapeshifter so much as it's because he just doesn't care. The real test of Trump's ability to shift to a general election is whether he can make his core principles palatable to a broad audience, or at least obscure them enough to escape scrutiny. And yes, Trump has core principles. If there's one constant in Trump's rhetoric, from his role in the ""birther"" movement five years ago to his present campaign, it's his nativism, his anti-Muslim attitudes, his assorted flavors of bigotry. His opening campaign gambit was mass deportation coupled with a wall along the Mexican border--a position he still holds. Later that fall, he bolstered his intra-Republican Party popularity with a call to ban Muslims from the United States. He boosts racists on social media, is friendly (or at least not hostile) to real-life white supremacists, and has refused to disavow anti-Semitic attacks from his online supporters. Even now, after winning the GOP nomination, he indulges misogyny and misogynistic attacks. In the 10 months since he launched his campaign for president, Trump has showed the extent to which bigotry sits at the center of his persona. And if he's going to shapeshift for a general audience, he needs to obscure it. Thus far, there's no evidence he can. On Thursday, the Republican presidential nominee appeared on Fox News with Bill O'Reilly, where he delivered a message to Vicente Fox, the former Mexican president. ""Yeah,"" he said, ""get your money ready, 'cause you're going to pay for the wall."" When your campaign is all affect and attitude, what is there to pivot away from but yourself?

21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/why_republicans_who_hate_trump_are_afraid_to_say_so.html	"This article appears in slightly different form in the Financial Times. At the height of the Watergate scandal, Republicans found themselves facing an unenviable dilemma: whether to break with the lawbreaker Richard Nixon or remain faithful to party and president. Howard Baker, the senior Republican on the Senate Watergate committee, took the courageous route and pressed the investigation forward. He became famous for asking: ""What did the president know and when did he know it?"" After Nixon resigned, Baker went on to become Senate majority leader, White House chief of staff, and ambassador to Japan. He died in 2014, his name synonymous with political integrity. One of Baker's fellow Republicans on the Watergate committee, a handsome World War II hero named Edward Gurney, followed the opposite course. He earned Nixon's gratitude by staying loyal until the bitter end. Soon after the president resigned to avoid impeachment, Gurney left the Senate under a cloud of corruption charges. Though exonerated in court, he was unable to win back even a House seat. He ended a sad figure peddling property in Florida. When he died, the headline on his obituary read, ""E.J. Gurney, 82, Senator Who Backed Nixon."" Republicans understand that Donald Trump's pending nomination presents another reputation-defining moment. Yet nearly all are making their decisions on the basis of self-interest, rather than principle. Those who would break with their party face daunting consequences, including the denial of campaign funds from their national party, the risk of losing votes from Trump's supporters, and the expectation of frontal attacks by the likely nominee himself. It should take nothing away from those standing against Trump to point out that they tend to be those least likely to suffer for doing so, such as conservative intellectuals and retired politicians. The living former Republican presidents, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, said last week that they would not endorse him. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina senator who has been Trump's most trenchant antagonist, tweeted after the Indiana primary: Note, however, that Graham does not stand for re-election until 2020, when a different Republican will probably be heading his ticket. We have heard less from those with more to lose. Kelly Ayotte, a New Hampshire senator up for re-election, says she will ""support"" Trump but not ""endorse"" him, a distinction without a difference. Paul Ryan, speaker of the House of Representatives and chairman of the Republican National Convention, says he is ""not ready"" to endorse Trump. One wonders how long Ryan can remain in this indeterminate state, between the motion and the act, while absorbing threats from Sean Hannity and other Trump supporters. Why are politicians who disdain Trump so reluctant to oppose him directly? The first reason is that Republicans are hierarchical and much less inclined to break ranks than Democrats. None wants to be identified as helping his or her party accept a necessary defeat. There is also the matter of financial consequences. The House and Senate campaign committees that direct hundreds of millions of dollars to candidates will soon come under Trump's sway. Staffers at the Republican National Committee have been told that they can support the Republican nominee or find new jobs. Candidates also fear Rupert Murdoch's media machine, which has fallen into formation behind Trump. Then there is the electoral math. Arizona Sen. John McCain, who abhors Trump, has not come out against him for the simple reason that he too is running for re-election. Hispanics are 22 percent of his electorate and will come out in force to oppose Trump. Because most will vote straight Democratic tickets, this may drag McCain to a defeat in a race he ought otherwise to have won. But endorsing Hillary Clinton risks alienating white Republican voters whom McCain cannot afford to lose if he is to retain his seat. At the other extreme from hostages like McCain are the so-called Vichy Republicans, whose self-interest aligns with embracing Trump. The most egregious are former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who aspire to revive moribund careers by becoming Trump's running mate. Others are falling into line, as they would behind a corpse or convict chosen by a majority of Republican voters. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he will support Trump, even though Trump may cost Republicans control of the Senate, and thereby cost McConnell his job. Still others, like Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, who was elected as a Tea Party darling in 2014, continue to promote the notion of a third-party alternative for conservatives. But the chance for the party to rally around stopping Trump, optimistically overstated in this space a month ago, is now past. Republicans face a choice like the one they did during Watergate or the McCarthy era.* Will they risk defeat for principle? Or survive to be remembered as the Edward Gurneys of 2016? *Correction, May, 9, 2016: This article originally misidentified 1940 Republican presidential candidate Wendell Willkie as an isolationist.

22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/it_s_donald_trump_s_party_not_paul_ryan_s.html	"House Speaker Paul Ryan, the saint of the Beltway press, polished up his halo Thursday and went on CNN to say that he could not in good conscience support this vulgar beast that his party's primary voters selected to be their presidential nominee. And yet ... ""I'm not there right now,"" Ryan said in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday. ""And I hope to, though, and I want to. But I think what is required is that we unify the party, and I think the bulk of the burden on unifying the party will have to come from our presumptive nominee."" Uh huh. The burden really is on Ryan to make the move toward Trump, and it's only a matter of time before he does so. More specifically: He has 70-something days to fall in line. That's how much time remains before the Republican National Convention--over which Ryan presides--officially nominates Trump. Ryan won't just have to support Trump's nomination at that point: He'll have to gavel it in. There are all sorts of reasons Ryan said what he said Thursday: He wants to provide cover for nervous members of his conference to similarly distance themselves from Trump, he wants a meeting with Trump, he genuinely believes that Trump is insane and doesn't want to be associated with the guy, he wants to preserve his beatified glow in the media, he wants to retain his strong standing among ""Never Trump"" ideological conservative snoots, and so on. All well and good. And, again, he can get away with this for about 70 more days. The problem with Ryan's posture is that he fancies himself the leader of the Republican Party when that is manifestly no longer the case, if it ever was. Trump is the leader, at least for the next six months, and Trump understands this. If the taco bowl tweet was Trump's most embarrassing offering to the public this week, Friday morning's tweet was one of his shrewdest statements in recent memory (not a high bar, but still). He's just so very correct. Trump won control of the Republican Party by persuading millions and millions of Republican voters to bestow that honor upon him. It is less clear, meanwhile, by what means Ryan thinks he gained custody of the Republican Party. Was it given to him by the ghosts of Abraham Lincoln and Robert Taft? We're all living here together in the present, and Trump got the power dynamic correct in the statement his campaign issued Thursday night: ""I am not ready to support Speaker Ryan's agenda. Perhaps in the future we can work together and come to an agreement about what is best for the American people. They have been treated so badly for so long that it is about time for politicians to put them first!"" (Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson, in a more recognizable Trump campaign flight of fancy, suggested that the speaker himself was unfit to serve.) If Ryan wanted a meeting, well, he got a meeting. And whether it's at that meeting next Thursday or some other meeting over the next couple of months, Ryan is the one who must make the attitude adjustment before he places the tiara on Trump's head in Cleveland. Unlike figures such as Rick Perry or Marco Rubio, who've come around to supporting Trump when doing so was optional for them, it's not an option for Ryan. Ryan's inevitable acquiescence to that reality will make him especially useful to Trump. The moment he throws in his lot with the real estate magnate will be a major step in the domestication of Trump. It will send the message that Trump has made himself into a viable candidate. Of course, Donald Trump is incapable of changing, but the narrative surrounding him is plenty malleable. What better way to trick the useful idiots in the media into believing Trump has improved than by getting St. Ryan to emerge from a meeting, gushing that the presumptive nominee has really ""shown growth""? Maybe Trump promises to stop calling for, say, the Muslim ban, and Ryan validates him, and the two raise their locked arms to the sky. Within a week Trump will just start talking about the Muslim ban again as if nothing happened, but by then Ryan will already be on the ship. Here's another sop that Trump could offer to get Ryan on board: nothing. Would ""nothing"" work for Ryan? He came into this believing he had leverage over Trump. He has none, and he's going to have to change his position in the near future. He'd better prepare himself to accept Trump and all his warts as the symbol of his party, because, whether he realizes it or not, Trump already owns him.

23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/bernie_sanders_and_his_supporters_march_on.html	"Three Sundays ago, just before the New York primary, I went to the enormous Bernie Sanders rally in Prospect Park, Brooklyn, to observe 28,000 Bernistas basking in afternoon sun and each other's wokeness. Art-mope rockers Grizzly Bear played a three-song set. Actor Justin Long gave an intro speech during which he apologized for being rich. And then, at last, greeted by Beatlemania-level cheers, Bernie emerged to yell about fat-cat billionaires and imminent revolution. Bernie had just won seven primaries in a row and gone hard after Hillary Clinton in their debate at the nearby Navy Yard. Everybody in the park seemed jazzed. Confident in their cause. Buoyed by the swell of their numbers. You know what happened next: Hillary crushed him in New York. She crushed him again the next week in a flurry of ""Acela primaries."" The delegate dorks were calling time of death on Bernie's nomination run--practically backhoe-ing dirt over his campaign. Still, he didn't drop out. Many assumed he'd now tone things down, stop criticizing Hillary, and play nice until he disappeared. So I flew to Indiana, the next state on the primary roster, to catalog a campaign on its last legs. When I got there, it appeared no one had told the Hoosiers to give up the fight. At a Bernie rally in Bloomington, corn-fed college kids packed an Indiana University theater to capacity, leaping to their feet for standing O's each time Bernie lifted his voice a notch or two above his usual bellow. A few days later, their compatriots in South Bend stuffed a convention hall to the gills, queuing up for blocks just to catch a glimpse of the sparse snowdrifts cresting Bernie's dome. Tuesday evening in Louisville, with Bernie doing Kentucky campaigning as he awaited Indiana results, 7,000 people stood in an outdoor, riverfront park despite the cold wind and threat of rain. These Louisvillians were every bit as pumped as their Brooklyn brothers and sisters had been a few weeks (and many delegates) before. They were psyched to boo Wall Street greed, and applaud criminal justice reform, and buy Bernie T-shirts and buttons and pins and hats and stickers. At one point, a buzz spread through the crowd and people began to look intently at their phones. Bernie paused amid a sentence about Hillary's Iraq War vote to make eye contact with someone offstage. ""I think we don't know,"" he said hesitantly into the mic as a huge smile crept across his face. ""Let's hold off, it's not for sure."" But it was for sure: He'd won Indiana. He was rolling on, delegate dorks be damned. Suddenly, his supporters didn't seem quite so pitiable or naive. * * * When Bernie first pinged my radar, last summer, he struck me as another in a line of irascible outsiders who tickle a certain subset of the Democratic electorate. You've seen cults spring up before around these high-minded, vaguely difficult men. Bill Bradley in 2000. Howard Dean in 2004. Ralph Nader in 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008 ... You can spot the type by their rumpled suits and aloof manner. See if any of this sounds familiar: Howard Dean received a flood of internet donations from an army of excited young voters. The gruff Vermonter (!) called his Democratic opponent, John Kerry, ""the lesser of two evils.'"" The New York Times noted Dean's indifference to style by marveling that he ""wore the same suit for weeks on end."" Or what about this, again from the Times, but now referring to a different schlumpy, unsociable candidate: ""Mr. Bradley inspired some people with the impression that he was above politics, running less as a 21st-century politician than as an Old Testament prophet, and he deliberately packaged himself as the package-less candidate, wearing scruffy suits and disdaining the hurly-burly of political attacks and counterattacks."" The Times at one point linked Bradley and Nader by terming them both ""distinctly uncuddly."" It went on to note that Nader was ""cranky"" and that he ""regards Hampton Inns as the height of luxury because they have serve-it-yourself breakfasts in the lobby."" When Bernie hit the scene, he immediately took up place in this club. The Times marked his arrival, impressively, by pulling off an unkempt and irascible twofer: It questioned Sanders about his tousled hairdo, which in turn prodded Bernie to bristle at the paper's frivolity. No surprise that Bernie eschewed a tuxedo when he attended the formal White House Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday. His refusal to ditch his humble blue button-down was solidly on brand. What I'm saying is: There's a fanbase out there for a candidate who can manage to exude this aura of purity, clearly. Some voters long not for a give-and-take politician but for a monk--a man descended from a worthier, less venal plane. Bernie's campaign does nothing to discourage this notion: At the close of each rally, at the moment Bernie ends his speech, David Bowie's ""Starman"" blasts from the public address system. ""There's a starman waiting in the sky. He'd like to come and meet us but he thinks he'd blow our minds."" It's not that Bernie's supporters don't care about issues. Of course they do. Every vote, for any candidate, is a hazy melange of head and heart. We weigh candidates' platforms against each other, but we also vote for a persona. A vibe. And to some extent, voting is a means of self-flattery--we use our ballots to reassure ourselves that we are hard-minded realists, or measured centrists, or fire-breathing radicals. When I interviewed people at Sanders rallies and asked what had drawn them to Bernie, a few people led with corporate greed or getting money out of politics. But the vast majority--at least 80 percent--didn't mention policy issues at all. Nobody praised Bernie because he wants to reinstate Glass-Steagall or hated on Hillary because she merely wishes to impose a risk fee on large financial institutions. It was all stuff like this: ""Bernie has imagination,"" said a 75-year-old woman in Bloomington, who wore a hat with a flower in it. ""We need visionaries."" ""With Bernie there's sincerity. There's authenticity,"" said a 38-year-old man in Indianapolis wearing sunglasses and a Bernie T-shirt. ""Bernie is everything that's good and right and fair in the world,"" said a 57-year-old, skinny, heavily tattooed woman in South Bend. Meanwhile, here's what people said about Hillary: ""Hillary's a typical, mainstream, corporate-owned politician."" ""I can't trust her."" ""I don't know what Hillary stands for. Maybe if she came out as a lesbian and let her freak flag fly ..."" Of course, none of those previous cantankerous, disheveled dudes got nearly as far as Bernie has. Howard Dean didn't win a single primary, dropping out after he finished third in Wisconsin. (Dean immediately launched a progressive PAC, which has recently been backing Bernie Sanders.) Bill Bradley quit after getting whupped by Al Gore on Super Tuesday, and he eventually exited politics to become an investment banker. (His seventh and most recent book has a hilariously marmish title: We Can All Do Better.) Ralph Nader's quixotic third-party campaigns never amounted to much, unless you count that time he helped get George W. Bush elected. (Nader was last seen calling Donald Trump ""a breath of fresh air"" in an interview on the Fox Business Network.) Meanwhile, Bernie has won 19 primaries. He's attracted more individual donors than Barack Obama did in 2008, he raised more money than Hillary through the end of March, and he's outspent every other 2016 presidential candidate. He's poised to roll off a string of new primary wins in Appalachia this month. He will almost certainly prevent Hillary from getting enough pledged delegates to clinch the nomination before the superdelegates work their backroom magic. This may be a zombie campaign, but the end-of-the-road vibe I went looking for in Indiana wasn't there. It's not so much that his supporters are delusional about his odds. It's more that, for once, the monk keeps winning, and they simply refuse to let the movement die. * * * Two weeks after Bernie suffered his dismal loss in New York, I watched about 100 Sanders volunteers gather for ""get out the vote"" training inside a dreary, linoleum-floored function room at Local 481--the Indianapolis chapter of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. After a briefing from a pair of national campaign staffers, they were invited to ask questions. One woman inquired about ""voting irregularities,"" and who she should call if she witnessed something suspicious. (She'd read that thousands of people--surely people clamoring to vote for Bernie--had been shut out of the New York primary.) Another woman wondered what she should say to persuade Hillary voters they were making a grave mistake. (The national staffers urged her to talk up things she loves about Bernie, not things she ""hates about other candidates."") Meanwhile, behind me, an obese man grunted at random intervals to no one in particular: ""The national media won't cover Bernie!"" ""Getting slandered by Hill-bots!"" ""I'm very disappointed in the DNC!"" At the close of the meeting, I went up to ask Aaron Robinson, the 39-year-old stay-at-home dad who's the Indiana campaign chair for Sanders, where he thought the campaign was headed. ""At this point it looks like we're gonna go to a contested convention,"" he said, ""and then anything can happen. When Bernie was running for mayor of Burlington he won by 10 votes. So it's not over."" Bernie himself held a press conference last week in which he suggested that a contested convention would be the fairest resolution. I asked Robinson what he'd do if Hillary won the nomination and faced Donald Trump in November. ""I would write in Bernie Sanders,"" he said. ""Hillary is part of the problem. I know that would be almost throwing away a vote."" Roughly 90 percent of the Bernie supporters I spoke to vowed they'd never vote for Hillary. Not even against Trump. Those who said they were willing to vote for Hillary in the fall sure didn't sound excited about it: ""It always takes Hillary a very long time to do the right thing,"" said a 28-year-old woman in Indianapolis. These folks might come around, as the PUMAs did in 2008. But if they're taking their cues from Bernie, he hasn't called the dogs off yet. At almost every rally I attended in Indiana and Kentucky, he continued to mention Hillary's speeches for Goldman Sachs and how much she got paid for them. Every mention of ""Secretary Clinton"" was met with lusty boos from the crowds, which Bernie seemed to relish. In Bloomington, a man shouted, ""She lies!"" and Bernie snickered in what appeared to be an appreciative manner. Bernie's still grumbling a lot about the ""corporate media."" So are his supporters. At the South Bend rally, an intro speaker complained that the press doesn't pay enough attention to Bernie. The crowd spun around to glare at us, up on our riser, and booed us heartily. One guy flipped me double middle-fingers. It might as well have been a Trump rally. But you know what? I get where they're coming from. * * * I confess I can't prove this, but I have a hunch that a lot of the mainstream, center-left media sort of wants Bernie to go away. Maybe it's because we think he can't win in November. Maybe we deem his policy proposals pipe dreams. Maybe we wish he'd quit dinging Hillary, because it helps the other side. Whatever the reason, while we spent a whole lot of time rubbing our hands together at the prospect of chaos in Cleveland, I haven't seen many left-wing pundits give succor to Bernie's call for a contested Democratic convention--even though his case is at least as legit, or maybe moreso in a strict delegate sense, as John Kasich's or Ted Cruz's ever was. On the south lawn of the Indiana Statehouse, four days before he won the primary, Bernie took the podium at a sun-splashed Friday-afternoon rally, this time in front of a bunch of stained-sweatshirt steelworkers from USW Local 1999. The union had assembled to protest the closing of an Indiana manufacturing plant. Carrier, a heating and cooling company, is firing 2,100 employees and moving jobs to Mexico. (You may have heard Donald Trump bluster about it in his stump speech. Or perhaps you saw the viral cellphone video of a Carrier bean-counter reassuring workers that it was ""strictly a business decision""--to which the soon-to-be-jobless Carrier employees retort, ""Fuck you."") From the Statehouse steps, Bernie again hollered at the powers that be. He railed against job-exporting trade deals like NAFTA (which came courtesy of Bill Clinton) and TPP (which Hillary lobbied for, before later expressing reservations). ""No more Clintons!"" people shouted in the crowd. Bernie scoffed at the gall of Carrier's parent company, which made $7 billion in profit last year and gave its outgoing CEO a $172 million retirement package, yet somehow couldn't dredge up the cash to pay American workers a living wage. I took a breath and reminded myself about the Kaldor-Hicks criterion, and how American consumers benefit from trade deals, and how capital will always move faster than labor so maybe these steelworkers ought to, like, suck it up and retrain to be home health care aides, and how, yes, Hillary has put forth some fairly sensible initiatives to help struggling manufacturing communities. But a targeted tax incentive doesn't stir the soul quite the same as an old man shrieking with righteous anger at the top of his lungs. And Bernie's right: It is fucking outrageous. Our country is a vicious swamp of greed. It's very hard to fault laid-off steelworkers for wanting to lynch the oligarchs and burn the whole goddamn system to the ground. Bernie channels their outrage--truly feels it--in a way Hillary doesn't and never will. And it's fair for these voters to question whether she's got their back the way Bernie does--given how palpably furious he is, and given that he's made the fight against corporate avarice the central plank of his campaign. Hillary's paid speeches to Goldman Sachs are not irrelevant. It's not absurd to expect a little purity from our politicians. I voted for Hillary in New York and I'll vote for her again in the fall. I think she'll make the best president of any remaining candidate, from any party. But those Bernie supporters who continue to show up for him--craving him, finding salvation in him, even as eggheads on CNN and Slate tell them he doesn't have a prayer--I don't think they're immature or deluded. I don't think they're silly. I don't even think they're wrong. I went to Indiana in search of the end of Bernie's campaign, but it's still going. I don't mind that.

24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/republican_politicians_won_t_say_donald_trump_s_name.html	"The entirety of American political journalism right now is working diligently to ask every single Republican politician, operative, interest group, and commentator in the country the same question: Do you support Donald Trump? For those faced with the question, it's a tricky risk calculus to work through, and the responses are ... complex, let's say. Sure, there are the ""Never Trump"" conservative writers and pundits flatly rejecting the presumptive nominee and cosplaying the French Resistance in their offices. But in the scheme of things they amount to a sideshow. The more interesting figures are those mainstream politicians who've lent their support to the presumptive nominee but either don't know, or are unwilling to say, the presumptive nominee's name. ""As she's said from the beginning, Kelly plans to support the nominee,"" a spokesperson for New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who's involved in a difficult blue-state re-election race, said Wednesday. Moderate Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, who had been supporting Ohio Gov. John Kasich's bid, wrote on Facebook yesterday that he now plans ""to vote for the presumptive nominee although it is no secret that we do not agree on every issue."" South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who used her State of the Union response in January to lambast Trump's brand of politics, said Wednesday, ""I have great respect for the will of the people, and as I have always said, I will support the Republican nominee for president."" (As an elected Republican woman, Haley is automatically on Trump's vice presidential shortlist. She reiterated yesterday that she has no interest in the gig.) Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, also up for re-election, insisted that he was still supporting Kasich yesterday. Once Kasich dropped out a few hours later, Portman, too, said that he would support the un-nameable. ""As Rob has been saying for the past year, he intends to support the Republican nominee,"" his campaign manager said Wednesday night. Who else? Just check your local paper, and you'll surely find some variation. Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts: ""I intend to support the nominee."" South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott: ""I've always said I would support the nominee, and nothing has changed."" This is a party that bashes President Obama and Hillary Clinton for being unable to say the name of the enemy, but many of its leading members can't even say the name of their party's own standard-bearer. Others will say Trump's name but will not use the obvious and efficient sentence construction of ""I support Donald Trump."" Instead they give people guided tours of their reasoning, taking great care never to adjoin the words ""support"" and ""Donald Trump."" ""While I don't support some of the rhetoric Donald Trump has used in his campaign, nor some of his policy ideas, I plan on supporting the Republican nominee at this time,"" Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski said. ""I will support the nominee of our party, and it looks like the nominee is going to be Donald Trump,"" is how Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts phrased it. And then there's the granddaddy of them all, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell: ""I have committed to supporting the nominee chosen by Republican voters, and Donald Trump, the presumptive nominee is now on the verge of clinching that nomination."" It's as if they're working out a syllogism on the chalkboard, unable to make the final logical leap: I will support the nominee. The nominee will be Donald Trump. Ergo, I ...  I ... do not know. Few politicians involved in anything approaching a competitive re-election race (which, thanks to Donald Trump, means a lot more of them) want to be associated with the simple quote, ""I support Donald Trump."" Same goes for Republicans who aren't in competitive elections but may not be inclined to fully untether themselves from decency. And so they respond to the question in this crotchety manner: I have always said I would support the nominee, for so I am compelled, now leave me alone. No one's going to leave them alone. Though their wording may not include the words ""I support Donald Trump,"" every headline announcing their position does. When Ayotte, for example, says she will support the nominee, the headline reads, ""Ayotte Will Support Donald Trump,"" what with the nominee's name being ""Donald Trump"" and all. The Ayotte campaign's wording does not make the work of her opponent's campaign any more difficult. ""[A]ll Granite Staters should be concerned that Ayotte has pledged to support Trump as the nominee,"" the campaign of her Democratic opponent, New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan, wasted no time blasting out Wednesday, ""even though national security experts and members of both parties have condemned his foreign policy positions as dangerous to our country's vital interests."" Perhaps eventually they will escape this untenable position and either support or denounce Donald Trump. Until then, for many leading Republican actors, the nominee will continue to be Nominee, and clauses and clauses will pile up between the first-person pronoun and any mention of Trump's name. It's as if they are building a rhetorical wall around Donald Trump. Read more Slate coverage of the Republican primary."	Republican Politicians Will Support Donald Trump. They Just Won't Say His Name.
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/i_was_on_the_college_debate_circuit_with_ted_cruz.html	"Yes. It's true. I was on the college debate circuit with Ted Cruz. I spent four years debating for Yale College on the American Parliamentary Debate Association merry-go-round of yellow legal pads, painfully awkward Friday-night keggers, and the infinite silliness that came with fighting for tiny silver-plated trophies each weekend. This week, watching the flameout of Cruz's presidential run, I can confidently say that he'd have had a far more effective life in politics if he'd remained in the law. My whole college debate experience with Ted Cruz can be distilled into a single, visceral, impression: that of being trapped in a too-small classroom in some dusty Ivy League building, with an opponent too big for the space. My memories of Ted are that he was too loud, too umbragey, and too rehearsed in an activity meant to mirror the clubby, off-the-cuff charms of the British Parliament. Until he made it to a final or semifinal round, every moment of any debate against Cruz was experienced as a mismatch between competitor and venue. You braced yourself to be screamed at by someone who wanted it more than anyone else. And you watched as the judges--usually college students, other debaters, and some faculty--clutched the edge of their long table as Cruz opened the tap on his ambitions and flooded the room. If you've known Cruz since college, it's easy to say that he has changed not at all. I've read numerous profiles that describe his time on the parliamentary debate circuit. They describe him as a fully realized conservative firebrand at 18, someone so fiercely competitive that he would pore over his debate ballots after tournaments in order to improve future performances. He was--most of his debate contemporaries would agree--often overrehearsed for what was meant to be a fairly casual extemporaneous competition. He could be moralistic and humorless. My frequent debate partner, Austan Goolsbee, who later served as an economic adviser to President Obama, could famously reduce Cruz to a puddle of goo with a well-timed joke. Cruz's style invariably tended toward the pompous, achieving the unenviable end of making a fun, oratorical activity into a joyless weekend slog. He liked to reframe whatever the topic was to his own advantage, a ploy he used effectively in GOP debates throughout the campaign. (We all heard the endless recitation of his father's arrival from Cuba to Texas with $100 sewn into his underwear, even if the topic on the table was euthanasia or the line-item veto.) And while one retrospective article described Cruz as ""sort of a stud"" on the debate circuit, I was struck less by his studliness than by his hyperfocused competitive instinct. Ted wanted to crush, crush, win, win, crush. He may have hoped for some Friday-night action on the side, but the real object here was the inexorable climb to the next height and the one after that. Watching Cruz's halting rise and crushing fall on the campaign trail this season, I've seen so many of the same behaviors: the canned absolutist lines; the just-add-water outrage machine; the too-loud, too-much quality that thrums through every venue until your face hurts. Putting aside the fact that someone I have been cordial with for more than 20 years has made himself hated, has come to symbolize burn-it-down government obstruction, and who still seems to make up for in volume what he lacks in empathy, I chiefly just felt regret as I watched Cruz campaign for the presidency. That's because I've also seen Ted Cruz in a room that suited his sense of grandeur (or is it grandiosity?), a room that was actually big enough to contain his staggering personal ambition, but within a system that by necessity checked most of the off-putting cravenness. To see him out on the hustings these past months, indulging in all his worst college-debate tendencies, was to see a man who had strayed from his actual calling. Like him or hate him, Ted Cruz was never a better version of himself than when he was arguing in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. * * * Most of my memories of debating Ted Cruz involve being hollered at. Austan was always defter than I was at deflating that which was most infuriating about Ted--the way he'd reframe a debate topic into something he had prepared, or would become fake-angry in ways that suited a 19-year-old even less than it suits a 40-something-year-old. I do remember that he wasn't funny, and also that he never ever seemed comfortable in his skin. He always wanted to relitigate whatever round had just been decided, even if everyone else was careening drunkenly around the quad. I have not one single memory of a relaxed Ted Cruz, or a joyful Ted Cruz, or an unguarded Ted Cruz. In every mental snapshot he is leaning forward and importuning someone to believe he is charming. I say all this not to bury Cruz but to praise him. While I wasn't his biggest fan on the parliamentary debate circuit, and while I have come to loathe his political ideas and his grotesque distortion of anything resembling the founding religious values, I also saw him at his unsung best. And for all the many college hit pieces, it's worth saying that he did briefly inhabit his own skin and should be credited for it. There was a time in the years when Cruz represented Texas as the state's solicitor general that he briefly matched the scope of his vision to the venue, which in this case was the Supreme Court. In the oral arguments I witnessed, Cruz was constrained by the rules of the house (just for instance, Chief Justice William Rehnquist wouldn't let him wear his cowboy boots to court) and by the constraints of law and deferential argument. At the U.S. Supreme Court there are inviolate time constraints, and subject-matter constraints, and--perhaps most of all--ego constraints. And when he argued at the court, Cruz's operatic style suited the vast marble room and the big constitutional debates. It was the only time in his adult life that I saw Cruz and his setting matched perfectly, and because he had to rein in the worst excesses, and win votes from the justices, and follow the rules, he managed to be far more effective than he has ever been in elected office. It's important to understand that when Cruz took over the sleepy Texas solicitor general's office in Austin in 2003, in part because he had burned too many bridges to succeed in the George W. Bush administration, he decided, with the blessing of then-Attorney General Greg Abbott, to transform the office into an engine for nationwide conservative causes. For the most part, I hated those causes. But under his leadership, the SG's office went from filing an average of three friend-of-the-court briefs per year to 70 in his five-and-a-half-year stint. He filed in cases that had nothing to do with Texas, simply to have a bigger voice in the most ideological disputes around the country. Perhaps the most important case he argued in those years--presaging his willingness to go after the GOP establishment-- was when he sued the George W. Bush administration in an appeal known as Medellin v. Texas. Medellin was a challenge to President Bush's claim that an international treaty applied in the case of a Mexican national on Texas' death row. In a 6-3 decision, the court sided with Cruz, ending the federal habeas corpus claims of the Mexican petitioner. My experience watching Cruz argue at the high court mirrors the conclusion of Michael Kruse, who reported in Politico this winter: ""In speaking to people who argued against Cruz in the Supreme Court, or who watched Cruz argue there, or who just watched him in practice arguments, called moot courts, at various law schools, I found a dominant recurring theme: He was really, really good, and he got better as time went on."" As Kruse also noted, Cruz was perfectly at home at the court. He had clerked there for Rehnquist. He had played in the basketball games at the court's upstairs gym. He had fully absorbed and integrated with the culture, and he knew that you couldn't win cases there by burning shit down. It was maybe the last time he checked himself, and also the last time I found him perfectly intellectually coherent. As Kruse put it: ""By the time he started appearing in front of the Supreme Court in his role as solicitor general, he wasn't cowed by the august setting, the high ceiling with the gold trim, the smaller-than-expected courtroom, the podium that puts attorneys so close to the justices they have to look up at them."" In April 2008, for instance, I watched Cruz argue in favor of maintaining the death penalty for nonhomicide child rapists. Subtly reframing the issue away from ""evolving standards of decency"" and the Eighth Amendment, Cruz reminded the court of the horrors of sexual violence against kids and that the defendant in this case, ""a 300-pound man who violently raped an 8-year-old girl,"" was, in Cruz's words, ""exquisitely culpable."" Classic Cruz: possibly brutal, definitely emotional, but forceful and effective. And he meant it. He had to. At the Supreme Court, there were real consequences for institutional nihilism. When Cruz took extreme and silly positions--like when he dragged all the way to the Supreme Court a case in which, due to a state error, a Texas man was given a 16-year sentence for stealing a calculator--the high court would slap him down. That was why Cruz was able to do his very best work arguing before the high court: He could do what he does best--argue, persuade, evangelize--but he could not lie, he could not change the subject, and he could not evade the facts or the law. Cruz had an opportunity to assume a judgeship when he finished in the Texas solicitor general's office. He chose a different path, taking the fight to the political branches and pointing himself in the direction of the U.S. Senate, and then the White House. At that stage of his career, unmoored from reality, he became a cartoon version of the parliamentary debater I once knew. All bluster and canned outrage, untroubled by reality, and determined to smash up everything in the room. And I will just say it: I miss the old Ted Cruz. The one who argued cases I may have hated, but did so civilly and brilliantly in the only setting commensurate with his particular set of skills. It wasn't on the presidential debate stage. And it wasn't in the final rounds of college debate tournaments. It was in the stagey, highly scripted national theater of the U.S. Supreme Court, where politeness and humility are still the coins of the realm; where you can't win by answering questions that weren't asked; and where facts matter, even if you want to pretend them away. Ted Cruz would've made a terrible president. He likely would've been an even worse judge. (Talk of him as a possible Trump SCOTUS nominee leaves me incapable of rational speech.) But that doesn't change the fact that he was a terrific oral advocate who wasted all that talent to become a failed presidential contender. Cruz was at his very best in those few years in which the bully pulpit was a bully lectern, and his big theatrical voice mapped perfectly onto a big theatrical stage. As a presidential candidate, he reminded me only of the humorless prepackaged Princeton debater who would say and do anything to win, for reasons nobody ever understood and none of us can remember.

26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/05/donald_trump_isn_t_going_to_be_president.html	"Now that Donald Trump is just a few delegates away from the Republican nomination, conversation among commentators has turned to his electability and his ""pivot"" to the general election. The same pundits who ignored the polls to say Trump would lose the nomination now urge us to take his odds seriously. He'll take on a more ""presidential tone."" He'll attack Hillary Clinton on all sides. He'll be formidable. He might even win. Or at least, that's the argument. But before we get there, we have to answer a simple question. How will Donald Trump improve on Mitt Romney's campaign for president? What will he win that Romney lost? Romney wasn't a bad candidate. He ran a competent and largely professional campaign against an incumbent who presided over high unemployment and slow growth. No, Romney wasn't favored, but he also had a better shot than most candidates who run against a sitting president. If you believe that Trump can win--absent an exogenous shock like a terrorist attack or recession--you need to show how he beats Romney. You need to move this from the realm of speculation and into the world as it exists. The idea of Trump as a plausible winner is rooted in the same error that drove pundits to discount and dismiss him as late as the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries. Then, observers saw the polls--which accurately showed his appeal to a cross-section of Republican voters--but refused to believe them. It was unthinkable that a field of ostensibly talented candidates would fail to stop Trump before he gained traction. That's what happened. If Trump had entered the race as an Icarus-type--a candidate who shoots to the top but withers under the heat--then by the fall, he was something different. He was a genuine presence in a crowded field with real support among Republican voters. No one bothered to stop him. Afraid of alienating Trump's supporters, GOP leaders disarmed themselves; fearful of Trump's attacks, Republican donors refused to fund a confrontation; complacent about his threat, Republican candidates focused on clearing their respective ""lanes"" rather than stopping the leader in the field. By the time Republican voters went to the ballot box, Trump had cultivated a following. None of that is operative in the general election. Unlike Republicans, Democrats plan to hit Trump with a fusillade of attacks from all directions. And they plan to exploit weaknesses that Republicans didn't touch until it was too late to stop Trump. They'll hit Trump for his open and vicious misogyny; they'll publicize his history of racism and discrimination; they'll attack him where he's strong with stories of ordinary people he's scammed and defrauded; they'll emphasize the fact that he doesn't know anything about the world or governing. Fed on years of anti-establishment rage and white identity politics, Republican base voters cheered when Trump toppled traditional politicians and rallied to his side when he called for a wall with Mexico and a ban on Muslims. Like Sharron Angle, Todd Akin, and Christine O'Donnell, Trump is tailor-made for a distrustful and angry plurality of the Republican Party. But the same polls that showed Trump at the top of the GOP primary also put him far behind in a general election. Like his predecessors on the fringe, Trump is anathema to ordinary voters. Which brings us back to our question. If Trump is a viable general election candidate--if he has a shot at the White House--how does he do it? How does he improve on Mitt Romney? Let's look at the popular vote. Trump needs to win about 3 million more votes to turn the tide. He needs to do that in an environment where the incumbent president is popular, the economy is growing, and most people are satisfied with their direction in life. By itself, that's difficult. Let's look at an electoral map. To succeed where Romney failed, Trump needs to flip at least 69 electoral votes. If he wins the four largest swing states--Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia--plus New Hampshire, he wins. If he breaks into the Midwest, he wins. If he captures the entire South, plus New Hampshire or Iowa, he wins. But how does this happen in practice? Florida, for example, is critical. Republicans can't win without it. To flip the state, Trump has to outperform Romney with Latino voters--there just aren't enough non-Hispanic whites to make up the difference. How does Trump fare among Latinos? Eighty-seven percent of all Latino voters have a negative view of Trump, according to a new Latino Decisions national survey. In Florida, it's 84 percent. In other Latino heavy swing states like Colorado and Nevada, it's 91 percent and 87 percent, respectively. If Trump loses 87 percent of Latino voters nationwide (and nothing else changes from 2012), the Democrats add North Carolina to their 2012 haul as well as 8 million more popular votes. OK, well, what about black Americans? There aren't any detailed polls of blacks vis-a-vis Trump, but most national surveys show disapproval in the 80 to 90 percent range. If black turnout stays at its present trajectory, Trump will need to crack 15 percent with blacks to peel critical swing states from Democrats. (A Trump who could accomplish that is also a Trump who is clearly winning.) No Republican has secured more than 15 percent of the black vote in 60 years. Trump is deeply unpopular with women, too. Seventy percent hold a negative view, according to a recent Gallup survey. If Trump loses 70 percent of women, then he's lost, period. What about white voters? The white share of the electorate has shrunk 2 points to 69 percent, while the Hispanic, black, and Asian shares have grown. In fact, of the 10.7 million increase in eligible voters, the large majority comes from nonwhite groups. If nothing else about the 2012 results change, the Democratic candidate will win with more votes across the board. Given that fact, as Greg Sargent details for the Washington Post, Trump would have to outperform Romney by substantial margins among whites to win Rust Belt states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Donald Trump begins the general election with a huge deficit in head-to-head polls, deep unpopularity, and major demographic headwinds. Unless he wins unprecedented shares of black and Latino voters, or, barring any improvement with nonwhite voters, unless he wins unprecedented shares of white voters, he loses. And he has to do this while running as the most unpopular nominee in 30 years of polling. He has to do it while running against a Democratic Party operating at full strength, with popular surrogates (including a former president) crisscrossing the country against his campaign. He has to do it with a divided Republican Party. He has to do it while somehow tempering his deep-seated misogyny and racism. All this, again, in a growing economy with a well-liked president--solid conditions for a Democratic candidate. Donald Trump has to become a radically different person to win. Donald Trump isn't going to win. Read more Slate coverage of the Republican primary."	Donald Trump Isn't Going to Be President

The consequences for America and the world--if he wins, of course, but maybe even if he loses--are unknowable and perhaps unimaginable. The degree to which, by changing the Republican Party, he will also permanently deform American politics can only be speculated upon, but his primary victory will, decades from now, likely be seen as one of the defining events of 21st-century America. And yet when people look back at Tuesday night's results a generation from now, our larger cultural response--at least as seen through our television media--will seem incomprehensible. On TV Tuesday night, there was hardly a whimper. CNN, MSNBC, and Fox contented themselves with bright chatter about Ted Cruz's hurt feelings, about Donald Trump's political skill, about the feckless, pathetic Republican establishment. None of the commentators I saw mentioned the import of what was happening. Large chunks of the media have spent so long domesticating Trump that his victory no longer appeared momentous. He is the new normal. ""We will be listening very closely to the tone Trump and Cruz take,"" Wolf Blitzer told his audience, as we waited for the two men--the triumphant winner and the insincere loser--to speak to their respective supporters. ""The fact is, he tapped into a zeitgeist,"" David Axelrod said. ""Donald Trump has a phenomenal sense of his audience."" ""It's stunning, and it's historic,"" Gloria Borger finally said on CNN. But she didn't mention anything stunning or historic, merely noting Trump's ability to ""tap into something."" It was as if CNN had decided to cover 9/11 as a story about real estate in Lower Manhattan. On MSNBC and Fox, the talk was similar. Would Trump debate Clinton? Could he win over female voters? By the time Cruz announced, less than two hours after the polls had closed in Indiana, that he was dropping out of the race, it had begun to seem like something out of a dream. This was really happening. But television's acknowledgment that this indeed was happening did not affect anyone's analysis of what ""this"" was. There was little talk of ideology, or racism, or bigotry, or fascist appeals. Instead, the conversation was about process; Trump had been fit into the usual rhythms of an election season. The closest thing I heard to open-mouthed shock came from Rachel Maddow, who wondered, correctly, why out of 330 million people the Republican Party had chosen this particular reality-television star. The Republican Party is now a white nationalist party, or at least a party with a white nationalist as its figurehead. The one attribute of our politics that used to make it slightly more palatable than much of European politics is no more. We've had our Dick Cheney and our Donald Rumsfeld and even our Richard Nixon. But we could always take pride in the way our redoubtable two-party system prevented quasi-fascists from getting close to real power. We've never had someone so untethered both from reality and from any sort of institutional check or balance come so close to the most powerful office on Earth. Trump finally emerged at 9 p.m. to make a brief victory speech, but he didn't really say much, and he certainly didn't do anything to mark the moment. Back in the CNN studio, Anderson Cooper was talking to several network contributors. Was Cooper wondering, even for a second, what it meant that the man over whom he had fawned for so long was perhaps now going to be president? Did he care? Pretty soon the panel's discussion turned to Hillary Clinton's strategy, and the upcoming horse race. They could have been talking about any election.
