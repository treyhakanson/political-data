He argued for a foreign policy that matched the views of congressional Republicans, not the views of the U.S. administration. Many people, including me, were taken aback by this overt alliance between the U.S. opposition party and the prime minister of another country. But a Bloomberg Politics poll released this week shows that the alliance is deeply rooted. Republicans haven't just rejected Obama. They have adopted Netanyahu as their leader. I'm not just talking about Republicans in Congress. I'm talking about the Republicans surveyed in the poll. ""Recently, there have been clashes between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Obama,"" the Bloomberg questionnaire noted. It asked: ""Are you more sympathetic to Netanyahu or Obama?"" Democrats, by a margin of 76 percent to 9 percent, said they were more sympathetic to Obama. Independents, far more narrowly, also sided with Obama. But Republicans, by a margin of 67 percent to 16 percent, said they were more sympathetic to Netanyahu. This difference isn't confined to Netanyahu's speech in Congress or the subject on which he focused, the proposed nuclear agreement with Iran. When Bloomberg asked respondents to choose between two views of the U.S.-Israel relationship, 64 percent of Democrats chose this one: ""Israel is an ally but we should pursue America's interests when we disagree with them."" Republicans, by a margin of 67 percent to 30 percent, chose the alternative view: ""Israel is an important ally, the only democracy in the region, and we should support it even if our interests diverge."" On this question, independents narrowly agreed with the Republican view, 48 percent to 44 percent. The latter question, with its appeals to ""democracy"" and ""support,"" gave respondents a bit of a tug toward the pro-Israel view. Still, it's remarkable that half the sample, and a 2-to-1 majority of Republicans, said we should stand with another country even when it's not in our national interest. Look up other polls, and you'll see further signs of division. Two weeks ago ABC News and the Washington Post published a survey with two questions back to back. The first question asked, ""Do you approve or disapprove of the way Obama is handling U.S. relations with Israel?"" Democrats expressed approval, 66 percent to 21 percent. Republicans expressed disapproval, 86 percent to 8 percent. The second question was: ""Do you approve or disapprove of the way Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is handling Israel's relations with the United States?"" Democrats disapproved of Netanyahu's behavior, 58 percent to 21 percent. But Republicans approved of it, 59 percent to 21 percent. Overwhelmingly, Republicans preferred the Israeli prime minister to the American president. In February, Gallup asked Americans for their views of Obama and Netanyahu. Eighty-six percent of Democrats viewed Obama favorably. Only 16 percent of Republicans did. For Netanyahu, the numbers were reversed: While Democrats were evenly divided--31 percent viewed Netanyahu favorably, 31 percent viewed him unfavorably--Republicans judged the prime minister favorably by a margin of 60 percent to 18 percent. They embraced the Israeli leader, not the American one. A Pew survey found a similar pattern. When Gallup repeated its question in March, just after Netanyahu's speech to Congress, the poll found that Democrats had shifted against the prime minister. They now viewed him unfavorably, 46 percent to 17 percent. But Republicans viewed him even more favorably than before, 62 percent to 16 percent. As far as I can tell, this partisan split in favor of a foreign leader is unprecedented. I've looked for other cases in which members of one American political party, in contrast with the other party, preferred a foreign head of state to their own president. I can't find one. My first thought was Tony Blair, the former British Labor prime minister. He's the leader I embraced when I supported the Iraq war and didn't trust George W. Bush. But Blair's support for the war is one reason why he was a darling of the American right, not the left. Gallup's surveys show that Republicans consistently viewed Blair more favorably than Democrats did. Another plausible candidate is Nelson Mandela. His tenure as president of South Africa overlapped with Bill Clinton's presidency, so Democrats never faced a direct comparison between Mandela and a Republican president. But even if you go back to 1990, when Mandela was touring the United States just after his release from prison, his favorable rating in this country was only 58 percent, according to a Boston Globe survey. It was probably about the same among Democrats, since, according to the Globe's published data, Mandela's favorable rating was 50 percent among Republicans and 65 percent among independents. But in the same poll, President George H.W. Bush's approval rating was 78 percent. So mathematically, it's almost impossible that more Democrats expressed a favorable opinion of Mandela than of Bush. Even if you go back to the late 1980s, when Ronald Reagan was president and Mikhail Gorbachev was leading the Soviet Union out of the Cold War, you can't find a partisan gap in American admiration for Gorbachev. In the United States, the Soviet president had stratospheric approval ratings, climbing from 63 percent in 1986 to 81 percent in 1990--higher than Reagan's. But Fred Steeper, the Republican pollster who supervised the 1990 survey--and who had worked for President Bush's 1988 campaign--found no partisan or ideological pattern in the data. ""There was almost no difference between Democrats and Republicans,"" he reported. So the Obama-Netanyahu situation has no clear precedent. How did it happen? Where will it lead? One possibility is that the United States has never had such a divisive president. There's some evidence for this, but Gallup's data show similar partisan gaps in support for George W. Bush. Another possibility is that no other foreign country has ever had such a magnetic head of state for American audiences. But that isn't right, because Gorbachev's favorable ratings were higher than Netanyahu's, even among Republicans. A third explanation is that no foreign leader has ever courted one American political party, while antagonizing the other party, more aggressively than Netanyahu. These explanations can account to some degree for the gap in favorability ratings between Obama and Netanyahu. But they can't account for the partisan split in responses to Bloomberg's second question, the one about Israeli versus American interests. That split points to a more fundamental challenge. Does a majority of the Republican Party identify more with Israeli interests than with American interests? When Israel's prime minister speaks on the floor of Congress, do Republicans feel more allegiance to him than to their president? If so, will the feeling subside once Obama leaves office? Or does it signify an enduring rift in the fabric of this country?"	Do Republicans Feel More Allegiance to Benjamin Netanyahu Than Barack Obama?

Three of them--to build the ""economy of tomorrow,"" ""strengthen families and communities,"" and ""protect our country""--were so vague and anodyne that she could have saved everyone some time by simply waving an American flag. The fourth, though, while not exactly concrete, was harder to dismiss: campaign finance reform by (almost) any means necessary. ""We need to fix our dysfunctional political system and get unaccountable money out of it once and for all, even if that takes a constitutional amendment,"" Clinton said, throwing a populist hook to go along with the jabs she took at Wall Street during the same event. The former secretary of state didn't elaborate on the specifics of her reform plan, but it's widely assumed that she was lamenting Citizens United, the 2010 Supreme Court ruling that serves as a type of shorthand for the campaign laws that have allowed a deluge of outside spending to flood recent federal elections. Last summer, Clinton suggested she would ""consider"" supporting an amendment that overturned the ruling, an idea President Obama has also backed. It appeared on Tuesday that Clinton finally made up her mind. Clinton is an unlikely champion of the cause: At best, it is ironic that she would take on the mantle of campaign-finance-reform crusader; at worst, it is hypocritical. Just last year, as my colleague Beth Ethier noted, the Center for Public Integrity dubbed her the ""Citizens United candidate,"" explaining that she would become the ""beneficiary-in-chief"" of the ruling that paved the way for today's super PAC-dominated elections. That prediction has already proved prophetic, with super PAC Ready for Hillary helping to effectively clear the Democratic field even before she officially jumped into the race this week. And, as conservatives have been quick to point out, at roughly the same time Clinton was in Iowa decrying the role of big money in federal elections, her allies and other deep-pocketed liberal donors were meeting in San Francisco to figure out how to spend tens of millions on state ones. Clinton may believe the system needs fixing, but in the meantime she's made it clear she won't shy away from exploiting every advantage it offers her and her party. But the gap between the future Clinton is calling for and the present she is operating in comes with its own advantages. Many progressives are understandably uncomfortable with Clinton's close ties to Wall Street and other moneyed interests that are best positioned to exploit those same election-law holes she wants to fix, but if reform-minded advocates want those laws changed, they will be hard pressed to find someone with more resources to effect the change they want. Ironic, yes. But true. The reality of our political system is that the most realistic way to fight big money is with big money of your own--and Clinton's campaign coffers are in no danger of running dry. Last week, the New York Times estimated that her team and its outside allies are likely to collect in the neighborhood of $2.5 billion between now and Election Day 2016. Reform advocates will cringe at the thought of how much of that will be raised and spent by outside groups, but they'll be better served in the long run by an imperfect candidate who could be president than by a perfect one who has no chance of sitting in the Oval Office. Better to wager that Clinton keeps her promises if elected than to bet that a less problematic candidate comes out of nowhere to pull off a miracle. Still, Election Day 2016 is still 19 months away. It remains to be seen if Clinton is serious about keeping reform at the center of her campaign, and she's so far (in week one) painted with only the broadest of brush strokes. We don't know yet whether she will take aim only at Citizens United, or if she will call for more sweeping reforms along the lines of what Senate Democrats offered in 2010. The specifics of Clinton's plan--and how she sells them from the stump--will go a long way toward deciding whether she can match her lofty campaign rhetoric. Working in Clinton's favor is the fact that she appears to have found a populist message that crosses partisan lines. A poll conducted in tandem by Democratic and Republican polling firms last year found that voters backed a constitutional amendment to counteract Citizens by a 2-to-1 margin. Even self-identified Republicans said they were on board, 54 percent to 36 percent, when presented with arguments for and against overturning the ruling. More generally speaking, polls have routinely showed that Americans are both concerned about the role of money in politics, and would vote to limit the amount of cash candidates could spend and raise if they could. That all bodes well for Clinton as she tries to find a signature issue that wins over skeptical progressives while not alienating moderates. Working against her, though, is just how difficult the task at hand is likely to be--something her brief comments in Iowa alluded to. The reason that reform-minded advocates dream of a constitutional amendment--the longest of long shots--is because Congress appears unlikely to act on its own. Still, even that difficulty can be spun into a rallying cry. If Congress won't act, and a constitutional amendment is all but impossible, then the best and perhaps only chance at meaningful campaign finance reform during the next decade is likely to come from the Supreme Court. That can't happen unless we have a reform-minded president in office the next time a conservative justice retires. And the road to the White House is paved with super PAC money."	You Laugh, but Hillary Clinton Might be Progressives' Best Hope at Campaign Finance Reform 
2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/04/hillary_clinton_s_first_campaign_event_in_iowa_the_democratic_front_runner.html	"MONTICELLO, Iowa--Hillary Clinton's first campaign event as a declared candidate went smoothly and was full of contradictions. Held in a working garage where students at a community college learn to fix cars, it was a venue for a jumpsuit, not a pantsuit. But Clinton glided into the room as if she had just come out of bilateral talks in Switzerland. Two cars were parked with their hoods open and three engines hovered on stands--like transplants-in-waiting--and yet the room was totally odorless. Though it was an intimate conversation among eight people, a press corps of more than 10 times that number hovered out of the camera view and an even greater throng agitated outside. The message had tensions, too. Though Clinton has had a beneficial association with Wall Street financiers during her political career--so much so that she is receiving grief from her party's left wing--she talked about outrageous CEO pay and hedge fund managers who aren't taxed enough. Though she will likely raise a record amount of money for her campaign, she complained about how money is corrupting the political process. Clinton referred to herself as the ""people's champion,"" an idea that was launched by her soft-sell video announcing her campaign. ""There's something wrong in America,"" she said and then promised the audience of Iowa voters that she would take on four big fights. She wants to improve the economy by helping workers share in productivity gains and lessen the burden of college debt, strengthen the family, diminish the role of money in politics, and protect America from foreign threats. The event took place at Kirkwood Community College in eastern Iowa and lasted for more than an hour. During that time Clinton listened more than she talked as students and instructors explained how the school allowed flexible learning and has partnered with local high schools. Occasionally, she took notes. Often, she nodded purposefully as if set to some inaudible metronome. The Clinton campaign had promised to try to create small, intimate events, even though the press following Clinton is gargantuan. Outside the school, the line of cars from media organizations stretched beyond the power of the eye to see--which is far in a rural area where the flat land stretches to the horizon, interrupted only by a collection of grain bins. Two desultory protesters were interviewed by so many news organizations--foreign and domestic--you'd think they were responsible for deflating those Patriots' footballs. But the Clinton campaign wisely limited the press that could get in the room (though it was still a large number), which meant by the standard of campaign chaos, this was a placid event. The stagecraft matters for the campaign. Even if any event would feel somewhat phony with scores of reporters looking on (watch me relating!) the picture fed to the audience at home was of Clinton making intimate connections with everyday Americans. All campaigns and candidates require the manufacturing of authenticity. The best candidates manufacture it really well. As Ronald Reagan often said, being an actor was great training for the presidency. So Clinton was engaging in a familiar ritual by trying to set up a tableau that suggested she understood real people's concerns. (In the television age, candidates since Eisenhower and Kennedy have used regular people in this way.) But Clinton, despite the formality that seems to fit her titles as former senator and secretary of state, has something going for her that other politicians do not when it comes to these kinds of events. Though she is now encased in extraordinary privilege, which shields her from the normal abrasions of life that voters worry about, she has thought about family issues her entire life. So when one of the participants, a single mom, talked about how hard it was to attend community college, care for her three kids, and afford tuition and school materials, Clinton could refer to a scholarship she'd set up in Arkansas years ago for women in just that situation. This may explain why, despite her celebrity, polls show that voters believe she is the candidate who understands their concerns the best. Normally in these kinds of staged campaign events, candidates are mostly there to be shown looking like they're listening--and that was obviously the case here--but Clinton actually appeared to be listening, remembering the number of college credits one high school student had earned and quoting from her host, letting him know she was stealing his line. When one instructor talked about the changing economy, he said ""Fifteen to 20 years ago, things were great."" Without explicitly noting that this was the period after her husband's presidency, Clinton interjected briskly with a smile, ""I remember."""	What Hillary Clinton Has Going for Her That Other Candidates Don't
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/04/marco_rubio_s_campaign_will_rely_on_powerful_words_the_florida_senator_is.html	"Marco Rubio is the last of the Senate Three to declare his candidacy. First Sen. Ted Cruz, then Sen. Rand Paul, and now the other freshman senator with no executive experience is making his pitch for why he should be president. Each man has a double but related challenge. The first is political: How do they convince a Republican electorate that believes--or has been conditioned to believe--that Obama's lack of executive experience was proof he wasn't up for the job? The second challenge is making the substantive case: How will they actually achieve the things they promise? The first question, as Barack Obama proved, is pretty easy to overcome if you give voters something to cheer about. Partisans want to be moved. Cruz appealed to conservatives through the evangelical base. Paul appealed to conservatives through a pitch to the libertarian and tea party mix of liberty voters. Rubio appealed to his audience by singing the song of the American dream and his family's embodiment of it. ""My father stood behind a small portable bar in the back of a room for all those years, so that tonight I could stand behind this podium in the front of this room,"" Rubio said. The speech was full of lovely rhetorical notes like his conjuring of the sound of his father's keys when he came home at night. This is powerful and appealing to voters. Rubio is the kind of politician who makes voters proud to be in a party that would have him in it. On the second question--how they are going to achieve their visions--Cruz and Paul both suggested that they would build such a powerful uprising of conservatives outraged at Washington that they would pressure the gridlocked system into changing its ways. Paul, like Obama in 2007, referred to his bipartisan efforts he's made while in the Senate (and, like Obama, oversold the promise contained in them). Rubio opted out of answering the question altogether. He didn't talk about what he has done in the Senate or what he tried to do (immigration reform) or what he accomplished before he came to Washington. His speech was a tone poem to the possibilities of America. It was here that Rubio made his only feint toward the question of his competency. ""I live in an exceptional country where even the son of a bartender and a maid can have the same dreams and the same future as those who come from power and privilege. ... I have heard some suggest that I should step aside and wait my turn. But I cannot. Because I believe our very identity as an exceptional nation is at stake, and I can make a difference as president,"" Rubio said. By this logic, to challenge Rubio's fitness for the job is to challenge the premise of the American dream itself. That Rubio can make a difference seems to be founded, for the moment, on the idea that he is from a country where in the past the improbable has made a difference. Of all three candidates' announcements, Rubio's was the purest embodiment of the Obama caricature. It was all words. Even Obama, in his announcement speech, made a go at trying to explain how he would reach the bipartisan promise land he was outlining. This tells us something about the enduring power of the rhetorical ability that got President Obama elected. Despite the derision about a candidate and a president who is all talk, words and the images Rubio conjures are essential to his campaign. (You don't make your opening pitch with your weakest stuff.) Rubio also took another page from the Obama playbook. Obama could preach change and have voters believe it because he looked different. No matter what he did in office, he would represent a change. Rubio's opening speech reflected the same logic. America's challenges can only be solved through a new generation, he said. ""This election is not just about what laws we will pass. It is a generational choice about what kind of country we will be. Just yesterday, a leader from yesterday began a campaign for president by promising to take us back to yesterday."" The generational charge is central to his argument that he is a great contrast to Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, but it's also a posture only he can embody. No one looks and acts like a new generation more than Marco Rubio. A campaign announcement can't be all things, and the lack of policy is obviously not because Rubio doesn't have any policy ideas. He has delivered more detailed presidential policy than any other candidate and is making that a big element of his campaign: new solutions for a new generation. Unlike a candidate like Gov. Scott Walker, who promises boldness but has yet to offer much that is bold, or Paul, whose call for term limits and a balanced budget amendment is recycling ideas that have been around for decades, Rubio is promising newness and has a series of actual ideas that are new. The unanswered question for the Florida senator is how he can use more than mere rhetoric to achieve all of the policy ideas he has.

Si usted quiere detenerla, unase ahora."" Earlier in the afternoon, before Clinton's announcement, he'd tweeted the English version: ""We deserve better than Hillary. If you're committed to stopping her, add your name now."" Both tweets led to the same ""Stop Hillary"" sign-up form on the website of Bush's Right to Rise PAC. Did large numbers of Hillary-hating Spanish speakers desperate to keep Clinton out of the White House flock to the site? I have no idea, though my strong suspicion is that the answer is no. You might think that there's nothing intrinsically interesting about a 21st-century American politician tweeting in English and Spanish. Hillary Clinton does the same thing. But Bush isn't just tweeting in Spanish. He is famously proud of his fluent Spanish and his bicultural identity, and he sees his deep understanding of Latino voters as central to his pitch for the presidency. The problem is that Bush doesn't actually get what it will take to win Latino voters. One could make the case that no Republican does, at least not yet. The only one who comes close is Bush's old protege Marco Rubio, who has just formally launched his own campaign for the GOP presidential nomination. What doesn't Bush get about the Latino electorate? Basically, he seems to believe that to win Latinos the most important things Republicans can do is embrace the idea of substantially increasing immigration levels. Once they do that, Latinos will naturally flock to a conservative message built around promoting upward mobility through tax cuts, deregulation, and entitlement reform. To be clear, this isn't just Bush's view. It is shared by most of the GOP establishment that is lining up behind Bush, as evidenced by the Republican National Committee's official autopsy of Mitt Romney's 2012 defeat. It just so happens that this view is wildly off base. Let's set aside the inconvenient fact that as many as 84 percent of Republicans want lower immigration levels, not higher levels, and that you'd have to win over many new pro-immigration voters to replace the old anti-immigration voters you might lose by embracing open borders. Let's also ignore the fact that not all Latinos favor Bush's vision for immigration reform--42 percent of U.S.-born Latinos, for example, opposed President Obama's decision to grant millions of unauthorized immigrants a temporary reprieve from deportation, a decent proxy for more conservative views on immigration policy in general. (This is important because while Latinos represent a rapidly growing share of the U.S. population, only about half of them are eligible to vote, because Latinos are relatively young and a disproportionately large percent of them are not U.S. citizens, as Brookings Institution demographer William Frey has observed.) The truth is that most Latinos, like most other Americans, vote on the basis of class interest. So far, it doesn't seem as though Bush will offer working- and lower-middle-class Latino voters much more than bromides about free enterprise and about how cutting Social Security and Medicare will somehow guarantee all Americans a brighter future. And I say this as someone who is generally very sympathetic to these bromides. To understand why Latinos tend to back Democrats over Republicans, keep in mind that the median household income for Latinos in 2013 was $40,963 while the median household income for non-Hispanic whites was $58,270. Many Latinos back the Democratic Party not because they are single-issue immigration voters but rather because they support the party that fights for expanding Medicaid and other means-tested programs that aim to give low-income households an economic boost. Granted, money isn't everything. The median household income for Asian American households is even higher ($67,065) than that of non-Hispanic whites, and Asian Americans, like Latinos, lean Democratic. Nevertheless, it seems foolish to discount the fact that Democrats appeal to Latinos in large part because they back programs that materially benefit Latinos. Support for redistribution proved particularly salient in the aftermath of the housing bust, which had a devastating effect on Latino families. Back when Latinos were climbing the property ladder in the mid-2000s, many were receptive to George W. Bush's calls for an ownership society. This is a big part of why Bush managed to win 44 percent of the Latino vote in 2004. When housing prices plummeted, and when millions of Latinos found themselves out of work and burdened by underwater mortgages, they were more receptive to Democrats calling for debt relief, extended unemployment benefits, and other economic lifelines. Not surprisingly, Latinos voted for Barack Obama in large numbers in 2008 (67 percent) and in 2012 (71 percent). Note that John McCain, who favored Bush-style immigration reform, and Romney, who opposed it, both fared extremely poorly with Latino voters. And there is reason to believe that Latino support for redistribution is about more than the fact that Latino families often benefit from it; it reflects a more deep-seated pessimism about the promise of the American economy. Back in 2013, the Public Religion Research Institute released its ambitious Hispanic Values Survey, which found that 77 percent of Latinos favor increasing taxes on U.S. households earning more than $250,000 per year and that 83 percent favor raising the minimum wage. A far bigger issue for a Republican like Jeb Bush is that 72 percent of Latinos believe that the U.S. economic system is rigged in favor of the wealthy and 60 percent do not believe that hard work is a guarantee of success. This skepticism about the virtues of free enterprise helps explain why 58 percent of Latinos believe that the best way to boost economic growth is to increase government spending, and to finance this increase with higher taxes on the rich. One-third of Latinos (33 percent) believe that cutting taxes and cutting government spending is the better way to go, but these Latinos are also more likely to be U.S.-born--and in turn more opposed to increasing future immigration levels. By all accounts, Bush is a fairly conventional supply-sider when it comes to economic policy. He might hold a personal grudge against Americans for Tax Reform's Grover Norquist, a man who made his father's life a living hell after the elder Bush violated his ""no new taxes"" pledge in 1990. Yet his substantive views on taxes are not all that different from Norquist's. Moreover, he believes that the main thing government can do to promote economic growth is to unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of Americans and to ensure that the growth of government is contained. Simply put, Bush is out of step with how Latinos see the American economy and what they think it will take to revitalize it. To win Latinos, GOP candidates can't just get behind immigration reform and hope for the best. They must speak to the economic anxieties of working- and lower-middle-class Americans of all ethnic backgrounds. If Republicans believe that increasing taxes and public investment are not the best strategies for building a flourishing society that lifts the economic fortunes of the poor as well as the rich, they need to actually make an affirmative case for a more conservative approach. If Bush fails to do just that, Marco Rubio has an opportunity to steal his thunder. Rubio's main advantage when it comes to winning over Latino voters is not that he is a second-generation Cuban American. For one thing, less than 4 percent of Latinos are of Cuban origin while almost two-thirds (64.6 percent) are of Mexican origin, and the ethnic politics of southern Florida are profoundly different from those of southern Texas or Southern California. Rather, Rubio's advantage is that more than almost any other leading Republican, he's dedicated himself to thinking about and talking about how conservatives can advance middle-class economic interests. Not all of Rubio's proposals are fully baked. His signature tax reform proposal has been criticized (justifiably) on the grounds that it's a huge revenue-loser that promises all things to all people. Yet Rubio has pushed a number of promising ideas, like higher wage subsidies for low-income workers, a new child credit to make it easier for middle-income parents to make ends meet, and modest higher education reforms designed to steer students toward high-quality, cost-effective colleges and away from diploma mills that produce more dropouts than graduates. Even if you believe that winning Latino voters per se is not the key to winning the presidency in 2016, as Henry Olsen of the Ethics and Public Policy Center has convincingly argued, it will be all but impossible for Republicans to win without attracting more working- and lower-middle-class voters. Whether or not Rubio's emerging domestic policy agenda is compelling enough to win these voters--I happen to think he has more work to do--he recognizes the nature of the challenge that's ahead of him. That puts him miles ahead of Bush and every other Republican in the field."	What the GOP Doesn't Get About Latino Voters
5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/04/hillary_clinton_campaign_video_announcing_her_presidential_run_she_wants.html	"People's Champion. That's Hillary Clinton's first crack at explaining why she's running for president. (What she once called ""the hard question."") The campaign video she released announcing her candidacy on Sunday was all about the people--expectant parents, job seekers, a same-sex couple on the verge of marriage, and women of all ages and ethnicities. This was a celebration of what National Journal's Ron Brownstein called the ""coalition of the ascendant""--the young people, minorities, and college-educated whites--especially women--who helped give Barack Obama his two victories and who Democrats think are the key to a string of future presidential victories. It was such a play to this group that Business Week's Josh Green said the ad should have ended with a tag line that read ""Ron Brownstein is responsible for the content of this message."" The online spot was a departure from the recent vintage of announcement videos where the candidate is hard to distinguish from an action hero, ready to solve America's problems: foreign, domestic, and extra-terrestrial. The Clinton video--which is the opening argument of her campaign--did exclude some people. She makes it clear that she is not running for all the people. As she wrote on Twitter, ""Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion."" She is not promising to be the champion of ""every American"" but rather ""everyday Americans."" In that grammatical choice lies the campaign: a fight for the people who have been left out of the economic recovery. In order to put the voters center stage, Clinton doesn't appear until more than 90 seconds into the video. By then, all the voters she hopes to stitch into her coalition have seen a version of themselves. In the most recent CBS poll, Clinton gets low marks for honesty--only 42 percent of the country thinks she is honest and trustworthy--and her favorability is low (only 26 percent have a favorable opinion of her). For the viewers who have these chilly views of her, this opening gambit was a warmth-graft, associating her candidacy with superbly shot images of attractive, striving Americans. It was the visual equivalent of motherhood and apple pie wrapped in the American dream. Connecting Clinton with people plays to her strengths. A strong majority (56 percent) believes that she cares about people like them. Clinton promised hard work in her kick-off announcement, a promise her husband often made. Voters like to know a politician will battle for them, but in Clinton's case the pledge goes beyond that. It sends a message meant to counteract one of the attacks Republicans will make against her. Today on Face the Nation, GOP Chairman Reince Priebus immediately talked about Clinton's air of ""inevitability"" when he addressed her candidacy. That word is meant to convey the idea that she thinks she should just be handed the crown and waltz into the White House. Clinton is trying to send a different message. ""I'm hitting the road to earn your vote,"" she said in her blue windbreaker standing outside what may or may not be a typical middle class home. She's not ""starting a conversation"" on a chintz couch, as she did in her 2008 announcement video. The message is that she's getting after it this time. In advance of Sunday's launch, Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook sent a memo to the staff outlining the tone he would like to set for the campaign. He called for collaboration, diversity, and humbleness. Mook told staffers they should pin the mission statement to their walls. A good idea given the drama that swelled in the 2008 Clinton campaign, but the test will be what else the Clinton staffers pin to their walls. A candidate who inspires in the way Clinton hopes to with her announcement video is the kind of candidate whose staffers pin her words to their walls for sustenance and motivation. During the low days of the Obama campaign in 2008, for example, staffers told me they would re-watch his speeches or his 2004 speech at the Democratic convention. It gave them lift and all successful campaigns have that. What Nixon, of all people, called ""the lift of a driving dream."" Hillary Clinton has finally taken off after months of idling on the runway. Now we'll see if, with a new message and a new campaign, she has what it takes to take off."

In its report, the North Charleston Police Department says Scott, who is black, took control of Slager's Taser and tried to use it against him. Fearing for his life, Slager ""resorted to his service weapon"" and shot Scott. On Tuesday, however, the Charleston Post and Courier released video footage that challenged the official narrative. Taken by an anonymous bystander, the clip shows a brief scuffle in which Slager uses his Taser. But then Scott runs away--his family said he didn't want to go to jail for owing child support--at which point Slager raises his gun and fires eight times, killing Scott. Slager cuffs him and later picks up a small black object and drops it near the body. This footage, which completely contradicts Slager's account, has led the city to take legal action, charging him with murder, and it fired him from the police force. It's a swift reaction that likely wouldn't have happened without the documentation. It would have been ""swept under the rug,"" says Scott's father. Instead, both the police chief and the South Carolina police union have condemned the shooting. ""It is a sad day for us all when a police officer makes what appears to be a very bad decision that resulted in an unnecessary death,"" said the South Carolina Law Enforcement Officers' Association in a statement to BuzzFeed, endorsing the murder charge and declaring that the ""swift decision to charge the officer demonstrates that law enforcement will not tolerate the tarnishing of the badge and oaths we all take so seriously."" For accountability, the video was crucial. There's not much more to say about the shooting itself, beyond remarking on how shocking it was. When it comes to police abuse, it's as close to an open-and-shut case as you'll ever see. But it's worth looking closely at the events that led to the shooting. Not the struggle or altercation, but the traffic stop itself. Simply put, Slager's stop of Scott--on an ordinary road in a sprawling Southern city--seems to fit a pattern identified by sociologists Charles R. Epp, Steven Maynard-Moody, and Donald Haider-Markel in their massive study of traffic stops in the Kansas City metropolitan area, Pulled Over: How Police Stops Define Race and Citizenship. The authors identify two kinds of stops: traffic safety and investigatory. In the former, drivers are stopped for clearly breaking traffic laws, from speeding to driving under the influence. These stops are straightforward. Officers explain the offense, follow a procedure, and issue a ticket. The process is quick and unremarkable. This is true for whites and blacks. ""In traffic-safety stops,"" write Epp, Maynard-Moody, and Haider-Markel, ""gender and age matter hardly at all and has race has no significant influence.""* Or, as they say a little later in the book, ""In stops for excessive speeding ... the driver's race (and gender) has no relevance to the likelihood of being stopped. It is driving behavior, pure and simple, that determines whether a driver is stopped to enforce the traffic-safety laws."" There are racial disparities in police stops--blacks are stopped twice as often as whites--but they aren't related to traffic safety offenses, in which cops exercise a little less discretion and violations are equal within groups. Where we see a difference--even after we adjust for driving time (on average, blacks drive more and longer than whites)--is in investigatory stops. In these, drivers are stopped for exceedingly minor violations--driving too slowly, malfunctioning lights, failure to signal--which are used as pretext for investigations of the driver and the vehicle. Sanctioned by courts and institutionalized in most police departments, investigatory stops are aimed at ""suspicious"" drivers and meant to stop crime, not traffic offenses. And as the authors note, ""virtually all of the wide racial disparity in the likelihood of being stopped is concentrated in one category of stops: discretionary stops for minor violations of the law."" The difference between the two kinds of stops is dramatic. Where traffic safety stops are mostly painless (other than tickets), investigatory stops involve searches, impromptu interrogations, and occasionally handcuffs and weapons. Here's how one black man described his experience:"	The North Charleston Shooting Illustrates How Broken Taillight Policing Can Lead to Tragedy

If you're the state of Michigan, the going price is $3.6 billion--the estimated cost of building a new site for a system designed to shoot down intercontinental ballistic missiles. This past summer, representatives of the Missile Defense Agency descended upon the Mitten State, promising the creation of 2,100 new jobs and assuring citizens that they would be playing a crucial role in protecting their nation. ""North Korea has launched satellites into outer space,"" Lt. Col. Chris Snipes told residents gathered at public meetings. ""They have that technology, and it's not a far leap to progress to the next level. If we wait until those threats appear, we're too late to defend the homeland."" It was a classic sales pitch, appealing to both pocketbooks and patriotism. And, like all adept salesmen, the MDA reps--along with their local supporters in government and the military--largely persuaded customers to buy an overpriced product that doesn't work as advertised. At present, there are two missile defense sites in the United States, at Fort Greely in Alaska and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The system, known as Ground-Based Midcourse Defense, or GMD, is the latest scaled-down iteration of Ronald Reagan's proposed anti-missile shield, which has been kept on multibillion-dollar life support every fiscal year since the end of the Cold War. The GMD system, rushed into deployment by George W. Bush's administration, relies on interceptor missiles tipped with ""kill vehicles"" that, in theory, will detach, detect, and collide with incoming ICBMs, destroying their warheads. The interceptors are designed to target missiles during the vulnerable midcourse phase of their trajectory--the time period when ICBMs are coasting in space after they have burnt out their boosters but before they re-enter the atmosphere under the influence of Earth's gravity. To date, 30 interceptors have been deployed on the West Coast, with plans to send 14 more to Alaska in response to the perceived growing threat of North Korea. But, members of Congress, arguing that this geographic imbalance has left the East Coast vulnerable to missile attacks from Iran, inserted a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2013, telling the MDA to find a suitable location for constructing a third site. The four finalists for this anti-ayatollah shield are New York, Maine, Ohio, and Michigan, where the MDA is spending $4.5 million to conduct 18-month mandatory studies to assess how this project would affect the local infrastructure, economy, and environment in each state. Hence, the sales trip to Michigan and other states to gauge local support and listen to public concerns. Unfortunately, elected officials are not listening to the concerns of the Pentagon. Congress wants to build a third site, but the MDA itself doesn't think it's necessary. As a result, the MDA finds itself in the peculiar position of touring the states and extoling the virtues of a system that it doesn't want to expand. On March 18, in prepared testimony before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, MDA Director Vice Adm. J.D. Syring reiterated his belief that the existing West Coast sites ""provide capability necessary to protect the U.S. homeland against the current and projected ICBM threat from North Korea as well as the future Iranian ICBM threat should it emerge."" In fact, Syring warned that building a third site would drain time and resources away from ""higher priorities""--notably, getting the missile defense system to actually work. For more than a decade, the $40 billion GMD program has been plagued with management problems, cost overruns, and technological failures. During flight tests, the interceptor kill vehicle repeatedly missed its targets. MDA sought to solve the problem with a new-and-improved kill vehicle--until it was discovered in 2013 that it suffered from the same key design flaws as its predecessor. A June 22 intercept test was the program's first success in six years. According to a report published by the National Academy of Sciences, these setbacks can be attributed to an agency culture that has ""spawned an almost 'hobby shop' approach, with many false starts on poorly analyzed concepts."" Likewise, the Government Accountability Office says the MDA's methodology of ""concurrently manufacturing, deploying, and testing interceptors is high risk because tests may uncover issues requiring costly design changes and retrofit programs."" The Pentagon's response to such criticism has been simply to double down and move ahead with its planned deployment schedule, while trying to patch up problems along the way. The lengthy fix-it list includes upgrading the GMD ground systems (which were built with 1990s technology) and developing yet another version of the current kill vehicle (unimaginatively named the Redesigned Kill Vehicle). The result is a faith-based timeline that confidently predicts that, after two more tests, 14 additional improved interceptors will be ready for deployment by the end of 2017. The Redesigned Kill Vehicles--again, after conducting just two tests--will be ready in 2020. No one credible believes that outcome is feasible. But, facts matter little when a $3.6 billion prize is at stake. In Michigan, the proposed missile defense site--which would be built at the Fort Custer Training Center, straddling Kalamazoo and Calhoun counties--has been endorsed by the Michigan State Senate and the Kalamazoo County Board of Commissioners, as well as Battle Creek Unlimited, an economic development group. (""Yes, it's a costly strategy,"" BCU board Chairwoman Beth Brutsche wrote in a letter to the Kalamazoo Gazette. ""But I place immeasurable value on human life."") And, the Detroit News recently reported that Michigan Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow and Republican Rep. Fred Upton are working with Gov. Rick Snyder's office to win the competition. ""We're in the official hunt,"" said Upton. He told his constituents: ""With growing threats from rogue states like Iran and North Korea--along with emerging threats posed by well-financed terrorist organizations like ISIS--we as a nation need to be prepared for the worst."" Precisely how ISIS would acquire the capability to launch nuclear ICBMs at the United States is anyone's guess--but, if you're marketing fear, why not go all in? In fact, the sales pitch for a new GMD site often skirted reality. If the states are the laboratories of democracy, they're also the testing grounds for promoting government boondoggles. Case in point: Lt. Col. Mark Gorzynski, commander of the Fort Custer Training Center, acknowledged that the system has a 50 percent hit-to-kill ratio, adding that ""destroying even half of any inbound missiles shot at the U.S. is better than taking out none."" And Snipes offered assurance that ""the system does work. In our last intercept test on June 22, we had a successful intercept, and it is the Missile Defense Agency's longest time of flight and the highest closing velocity to date."" Putting aside, for a moment, that a 50-50 chance of being nuked is being touted as America's new gold standard for national security, that number doesn't reflect real-world conditions. The June 22 intercept was indeed successful, but these tests are carefully scripted so that it is known in advance where and when the target will be launched and what it will look like. Real ICBMs will not be so obliging. What's more, the tests don't consider the myriad types of countermeasures, such as decoys, that incoming missiles can deploy to improve their chances of penetrating defenses. Even if we took at face value the claim that GMD has a 50 percent success rate, that would mean the United States would have to ""salvo fire four or five interceptors at each incoming missile to get above 90 percent,"" says Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies. So, those additional interceptors that are being deployed in Alaska, at a cost of $1 billion? ""North Korea can defeat that by building three extra ICBMs,"" Lewis notes. And then there's the argument for urgency. ""The Korean missile threat and the Iranian missile threat are real,"" Col. Ron Wilson, commander of the Battle Creek Air National Guard Base, told the media. ""If we don't pay attention to it, it's going to sneak up and bite us one day, and it will be too late."" But, ""MDA is wasting money on an interceptor that has no hope of keeping pace with new threats,"" says Lewis, who points to recommendations in the NAS report that the Pentagon should undertake a complete overhaul. NAS supports the idea of a third missile defense site, but only if the United States redesigns the interceptor and develops more robust radar systems and sensors to target warheads and identify countermeasures. The new system, NAS claims, could be developed and operated for 20 years at a cost less than completing and operating the current system. Nobody brought that up in Michigan. And it probably wouldn't have made a difference if someone had. ""We acknowledge the legitimate questions about whether building a third missile defense system is the best use of federal dollars,"" stated an op-ed by reporter Julie Mack in the Kalamazoo Gazette. ""The fact is, if Southwest Michigan rejects the project, it would simply go elsewhere, along with the economic benefits it would bring. It would be foolhardy to turn away that opportunity."" And as long as Congress continues to throw good money after bad, buyers can be assured that supplies will last."	Michigan Wants the Anti-Missile Shield (and the $3.6 Billion That Goes With It)

Announcing his candidacy for the presidency Tuesday, the first-term senator outlined an agenda for change far more revolutionary than then-Sen. Barack Obama did in the 2008 race, but one that is based on an identical strategy. Paul promises to create a grassroots movement so big and powerful that it will swamp Washington and reconfigure it. ""Washington is horribly broken. I fear it cannot be fixed from within,"" Paul said in Louisville, Kentucky, on Tuesday. ""We, the people, must rise up and demand action. Congress will never balance the budget unless you force them to do so."" Paul is calling for deficit reduction at a faster pace than Paul Ryan or any Republican budget hawk has contemplated (or has been able to achieve) and a balanced budget amendment. He is also promising to completely overhaul the American system of government and to install systematic reforms like term limits. The usual question a Republican candidate poses to himself is rigged: Can I be better than the dismal incumbent Barack Obama? But Paul is basing his candidacy on the idea that he can best the president at something Obama was already pretty good at. Even Obama's critics say he was pretty good at rallying the public. Remember those gargantuan rallies and crowds of 2008? Barack Obama is the first president in more than five decades to win at least 51 percent of the national popular vote twice. Obama could not translate his success at building a movement into success at building a sustainable governing force. On gun control measures for example, where polls showed he had the support of 90 percent of the country for items like background checks, he couldn't get Congress to budge. Most candidates make the case that they can win a governing coalition and that they have the skills to forge compromise or work the legislature or do whatever else is necessary to make the system work. Paul's candidacy is based on the idea that he can create a coalition that can get him elected and then keep that coalition humming so that it makes government hop to its will. That's a big challenge. An ancillary challenge is convincing voters he can pull it off. Haven't the Obama years cured people of belief in gargantuan change of this sort? Also: Do people want that much change? Life is pretty unpredictable and fast-moving. Do they want the kind of steady diet of disruption that Paul is promising? Paul also faces Obama's balancing act on foreign policy: how to promise a smaller, more humble foreign policy without looking too dovish to protect Americans fearful of Islamic fanatics. Unlike Obama though, Paul is facing headwinds. Obama put his primary opponents who had voted for the Iraq war on the defensive. Now Paul is the one on the defensive, facing charges of isolationism in a party where all the other candidates are competing to show who will have the most muscular response to foreign policy challenges. In his announcement, Paul wrapped himself in Reagan's call for ""peace through strength"" and tried to exorcise the more isolationist rhetoric he threw around when he was a surrogate for his father and that he resorts to sometimes when he's on the stump even now. In New Hampshire in January, he said, ""In Washington, there is not a war anywhere where they don't think there should be boots on the ground."" Paul is running as the Republican who can be trusted always to default to liberty in a pinch. He has a track record to support that. On foreign policy however, he is arguing for nuance and balance. Necessary qualities perhaps, but on domestic affairs Paul's candidacy encourages people to be suspicious of those who preach nuance and balance. This might muddle the message. If you're creating a revolution that will change the fundamental nature of government, people need bright distinctions they can rally around or they'll get confused and support other candidates or lose their motivation for your one true solution. After all, Paul's not just running to win on Election Day. He's building a movement for change."	Rand Paul's Campaign Strategy Is to Out-Obama Obama
9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/04/rahm_emanuel_re_election_chicago_crime_tickets_hassle_libraries_gangster.html	"If Rahm Emanuel defeats Cook County Commissioner Jesus ""Chuy"" Garcia to win re-election as mayor of Chicago on Tuesday, it won't be because he's made the city a better place to live. He hasn't. Sure, he lengthened the school day, spent $425 million to speed up the ""L"" trains, balanced four budgets, started a bike share program, and satisfied the courts that the days of ""who's your clout?"" political hiring are over at City Hall. Based on those bureaucratic metrics, Emanuel's mayoralty may look like a success. And that may be the case if you spend most of your time in City Hall, or even downtown. But most Chicagoans never visit City Hall, and they don't live downtown. They spend their days in Auburn Gresham, Norwood Park, Hegewisch, or Avondale--the self-contained neighborhoods that make Chicago feel more like a confederation of 50 wards than a single city. And in most of those places, life has become more of a hassle. The libraries are open only half a day on Mondays. (And that's a compromise after the mayor initially closed them all day.) Speed cameras spit out $35 tickets for going 36 miles an hour in a 30 zone. In the poor neighborhoods where Emanuel closed 50 schools, the children walk farther every morning and afternoon, often crossing gang boundary lines. Water rates have nearly doubled. These may sound like petty aggravations, but they eventually add up to the question Do I really want to keep putting up with this? Between July 2013 and July 2014, Illinois lost 10,000 residents, in its first population drop since the 1980s--an indication that the state and presumably the city have become less livable. Leslie Hairston, one of the few aldermen to vote against the speed cameras, complained they were a revenue grab that would drive the middle class out of the city. ""I guess this is just going to be a city for wealthy people, that's where we're headed,"" she told the Chicago Tribune. Hairston was half-right. Chicago has become a city for wealthy people and a city for poor people--people who can afford traffic tickets and people who can't afford cars, with fewer and fewer left in between. As Richard C. Longworth points out in his book Caught in the Middle: America's Heartland in the Age of Globalism, Chicago has developed an hourglass social structure, divided between global citizens--""hardworking, well educated, well paid, well traveled""--and global servants, who park their cars, bus their tables, and walk their dogs. Daniel Kay Hertz, a graduate student at the University of Chicago, put together an extraordinary set of maps illustrating the collapse of the city's middle class, from 1970, when steel mills and the stockyards still provided well-paying blue-collar jobs, to post-Great Recession 2012. Wealth has become concentrated in a strip along the lakefront, while poverty has spread through the outer neighborhoods. Emanuel did not create this divided city, but his mayoralty is a product of it, and he has an interest in perpetuating it, because the global citizens vote for him and fund his campaigns. The most extraordinary finding of the 2010 census was that the fastest-growing neighborhood in Chicago was the Loop, which has a median household income of $93,745. In the first round of the election, on Feb. 24, Emanuel made his best showing there, winning 73.2 percent of the vote in the Loop-based 42nd Ward. Billionaire hedge fund manager and 42nd Ward resident Ken Griffin, the richest man in Illinois, has donated $750,000 to Emanuel during the runoff. As a graduate of an elite suburban high school who made his career in Washington, D.C., then settled in the city to enjoy its cultural amenities, Emanuel embodies Global Chicago. The central theme of Garcia's campaign is that Emanuel has neglected the neighborhoods while building his global city on the lakefront. Nearly two years after the city debuted its Divvy bike-sharing program, it still hasn't reached most of the South Side. Emanuel offered parkland to filmmaker George Lucas for a museum that Garcia calls ""a monument to Darth Vader."" Garcia has also criticized Emanuel for spending tens of millions in public funds on a basketball arena for DePaul University ""when the city is suffering from closed schools and the violence that goes unabated."" After leading the nation in murders every full year of Emanuel's mayoralty, Chicago has become more renowned for gangsterism than at any time since St. Valentine's Day 1929. In the bloody year of 2012, when the death toll hit 505, Chicago picked up a mordant nickname: ""Chiraq, Drillinois,"" after both the war zone violence and the music it inspired. Drill, a dark, hardcore iteration of hip-hop that originated on the South Side, made Chicago the nation's rap capital, attracting record labels eager to exploit the glamour of gangbanging in America's No. 1 murder city. Gang-affiliated rappers Chief Keef, Lil Durk, and Lil Reese were all signed to six-figure deals. Gangsta rap was once defined by its East Coast-West Coast rivalry, but it had to go Midwestern. Chicago has had far less success in taming street crime than New York or Los Angeles, partly because the city's gang violence is so linked to its intractable segregation. Since 1991, when the movie New Jack City chronicled New York's Crack Wars, that city's murder rate has declined 87 percent. Los Angeles' rate is down 76 percent. In Chicago, murders are down 57 percent, but the city has surpassed its larger rivals in total killings, even though it lost population while New York and L.A. grew. Hertz also has a series of maps demonstrating that, like income, the gains in safety have been distributed unequally in Chicago. While murders have declined dramatically on the North Side, he found, parts of the South and West Sides ""actually got worse, including some neighborhoods that were already among the most dangerous in the city, like Englewood and Garfield Park."" Garcia has attacked Emanuel for failing to fulfill his promise to put 1,000 more police officers on the streets, or to curb gun violence in general, because, well, it's not a problem in the mayor's Chicago. ""I think the fact that I have grown up in neighborhoods in Chicago that are plagued with gun violence gives me additional standing, certainly more standing than Rahm Emanuel to lobby the state legislature for measures that will get more guns off the street,"" Garcia said. ""Why? Because I've seen gun violence in my own neighborhood, near my house, on a regular basis. I hear gunshots at night."" Garcia lives in the Mexican-American neighborhood of Little Village, which had a murder rate of 15.1 per 100,000 in 2014. As Garcia was forced to admit in a debate last week, his son belonged to a street gang--the Two-Six (Darkside faction)--and was arrested for attacking off-duty cops. ""My wife and I live in neighborhood with its share of problems, including gang activity,"" he said. ""My son grew up in that community; it's been challenging."" Emanuel lives in Lincoln Square, a neighborhood of muffin bakeries, bookstores, yoga studios, and vinyl record shops. Lincoln Square was murder-free last year. The mayor's children attend the University of Chicago Laboratory School, where tuition is $30,000 a year--more than the median household income of several neighborhoods where Emanuel has closed elementary schools. If Emanuel could have won re-election on his record, he wouldn't be in this runoff. So he's spent the past six weeks using his $20 million campaign fund to portray Garcia as a political naif and public-sector-union pawn incapable of dealing with the city's financial problems, particularly pension obligations that are consuming an ever-growing share of the city's budget. Emanuel surrogates such as Sen. Mark Kirk have warned that Garcia will lead Chicago down the same road to bankruptcy as Detroit. Emanuel may have been lucky to draw Garcia as an opponent. Garcia was the third choice of Chicago's progressive opposition. The first choice, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, probably would have beaten the mayor, by breaking into the coalition of blacks and upscale whites that elected him in 2011. But Preckwinkle decided to run for re-election last November. Garcia has yet to demonstrate he's more than a protest vote. His best idea for raising revenue--a graduated state income tax--would require an amendment to the Illinois Constitution. He promises to save $500 million by shutting down Tax Increment Financing districts and sharing costs with other local governments, but when asked for specific budget cuts, he says he will ""rely on the recommendations made by experts in the field, shortly after I am elected mayor,"" then refuses to name the experts. A home-stretch poll has Emanuel leading Garcia 51 percent to 33 percent, with 16 percent undecided. Rahm Emanuel can't say he'll make Chicago a better place to live, because he hasn't. He can only claim that Chuy Garcia will make it worse."	Rahm Emanuel Has Made Chicago a Worse Place to Live

The proposal, submitted to the United Nations ahead of this year's Paris climate talks, relies almost entirely on initiatives Obama had already used his executive authority to put into motion over Republican objections: strict new pollution rules for new and existing power plants, plugging methane leaks from the oil and gas industry, and ramping up the fuel economy of America's cars and trucks. The president's let-me-repeat-myself plan was greeted with applause from those climate activists desperate for something, anything, to cheer. But, as my colleague Eric Holthaus pointed out, the proposal is largely undeserving of earthly applause: There is nothing to suggest it will help slow global warming enough to avoid the type of catastrophic impacts that risk fundamentally altering the systems that support human civilization as we know it. Depressed? Just wait until next year. The best the 2016 election can realistically do is preserve the status quo, leaving us with a climate-conscious president, if a Democrat wins, still stymied by a climate change-denying Congress. Given that Democrats are unlikely to pull off the miracle they'd need to retake the legislative branch, if that dynamic changes at all it will almost certainly change for the worse: to a climate change-denying president working hand in hand with a climate change-denying Congress to dismantle Obama's environmental legacy one EPA regulation at a time. Still, not all GOP denialism is created equal. Perhaps as important as what Republicans believe is how they justify that belief to an American public that is slowly but surely catching up with the scientific consensus. With that in mind, it's worth taking a closer look at the different kinds of denialism currently on display from Republicans in Washington and on the campaign trail. We're Ready to ... Talk
White House hopefuls: Lindsey Graham, Chris Christie
Senators: Graham, Susan Collins, Lamar Alexander, Kelly Ayotte, Mark Kirk This, sadly, is as good as it gets. This group doesn't fully acknowledge just how serious of a problem the science says we're facing, but they at least concede it's a real problem that needs to be addressed. The issue: They don't have an answer to the question of how to address it, other than to say Obama's way is wrong. Graham has been a leader on this issue in the Senate for years--most notably working on cap and trade before abandoning that ship as it went down in 2010--and appears the most eager to force the issue on the campaign trail. ""Before we can be bipartisan, we gotta figure out where we are as a party,"" Graham said last month. ""What is the environmental platform of the Republican Party? I'd like to come up with one. I'd like to have a debate within the party."" Christie has been in no hurry to take part in that debate, but if he runs for the Republican nomination, it will be difficult for him to walk away from comments like this one he made back in 2011: ""When you have over 90 percent of the world's scientists who have studied this stating that climate change is occurring and that humans play a contributing role it's time to defer to the experts."" Don't expect Christie to offer his own plan on the debate stage, but there's at least some hope he'd dole out tough love on the general issue to his fellow Republicans. It's Just Not Worth It
White House hopeful: Rand Paul
Senate: Paul, Bob Corker, Jeff Flake, Orrin Hatch, Dean Heller, John McCain, Lisa Murkowski, Rob Portman, Mike Rounds, Pat Toomey All five senators in the ""we're ready to talk"" group voted for the Keystone amendment that acknowledged man plays a ""significant"" role in climate change. Those in this group were only willing to go as far as to say that man plays a role--a position that provides some cover against claims of full-on denialism, but one that still allows them to sit on their hands and do nothing without feeling particularly bad about it. ""I'm not against regulation,"" Paul said during a November interview with HBO's Bill Maher. ""I think the environment has been cleaned up dramatically through regulations on emissions as well as clean water over the last 40 or 50 years, but I don't want to shut down all forms of energy such that thousands and thousands of people lose their jobs."" The justification here is that the nation's short-term economic concerns should trump the globe's long-term climate fate. A similar argument that pops up from this group is that Washington's attention is better focused on current national security threats than on future climate ones. We Can't Do It Alone, So We Shouldn't Do It All
White House hopeful: Carly Fiorina
Senate: Majority Leader Mitch McConnell This justification is particularly frustrating given the GOP's bid to undermine Obama's efforts to actually broker international climate deals with countries like China and India. ""When discussing climate, scientists may agree that some policy change is warranted, but they also agree that action by a single state or nation will make little difference,"" Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett Packard, wrote in a 2014 op-ed. As Jonathan Chait points out, McConnell has deployed this logic himself, even though this week he went out of his way to try to sabotage any U.N. deal--the epitome of not doing it alone--by reminding the world that the GOP will do everything in its power to make sure the White House can't reach even those limited goals. The Unknowable Nature of Truth
White House hopefuls: Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Rick Perry
Senate: Rubio Welcome to the GOP mainstream. This is the largest subspecies of Republican climate change denialism, the type of politician who dodges climate question by saying they are ""not a scientist."" Declaring the science unsettled conveniently frees these guys up from the responsibility of even looking for a solution. ""I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it ... and I do not believe that the laws that they propose we pass will do anything about it, except it will destroy our economy,"" Rubio declared last year. During a recent trip to New Hampshire, Bush struck a similar chord, arguing that the federal government's role in combating climate change should be limited to conducting basic research. This stance is probably best summed up by 2011 Mitt Romney (not to be confused with the 2015 version), who declared: ""We don't know what's causing climate change, and the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try and reduce CO2 emissions is not the right course for us."" It's a Hoax!
White House hopefuls: Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum, Mike Huckabee
Senate: Cruz, James Inhofe, Roger Wicker This group might be declared the GOP fringe--that is, if one of their most vocal members didn't also hold the gavel of the powerful Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. When not penning books like The Greatest Hoax, Chairman Inhofe can be found throwing snowballs on the Senate floor in a misguided attempt to disprove climate science. Inhofe and Cruz voted for the not-a-hoax Keystone amendment in March, but that was quite clearly a calculated game of semantics. Last month Cruz veered back toward full-on denial during the rollout of his 2016 presidential campaign, dubbing himself a modern-day Galileo while cherry-picking climate data to claim that the satellite data proves there hasn't been any significant global warming in the past 17 years. (You'll find a detailed breakdown of the many, many flaws in that argument here.) Unclassifiable There is one likely presidential candidate whom I can't quite fit into any of the above subgroups: Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. While he has attacked Obama's proposed power plant rules and pledged to oppose any climate bill that includes a tax or fee of any kind, he's nonetheless routinely refused to answer specific climate science questions--even when they are posed by a second-grader. He is, I would say, in a class of his own."	All the Ways GOP Presidential Hopefuls Do Not Believe in Climate Change

""The presidency of the United States is not some crown to be passed between two families,"" he said in an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC's This Week. He continued: ""I believe that there are new perspectives that are needed in order for us to solve the problems that we face as Americans ... I believe that new leadership is needed."" O'Malley wants to be that new leadership, but in everything that matters, he's far behind Clinton. He trails in the polls, he trails in fundraising, and he trails in party support. But the former Maryland governor knows he's not going to overcome Clinton with resources. His plan is to stand as a liberal alternative for Democrats who want a more populist alternative to Clinton's modest, center-left agenda, and hope that--like in 2008--Clinton loses her grip on inevitability. It's why, after a career of technocratic liberalism, he's begun speaking like Sen. Elizabeth Warren. ""Over the last 12 years, wages have been going down, not up,"" said O'Malley during an event in Iowa last week. ""In fact, last year, Wall Street bonuses alone were double the combined earnings of every single American working for minimum wage to take care of their family. Until we solve this problem, we cannot rest--as a party or as a people."" For O'Malley to be the liberal alternative, however, he has to be liberal, or at least, more-so than Clinton. But not only is O'Malley close to Clinton on the ideological map of the Democratic Party, he might even be a little to her right. At FiveThirtyEight, Harry Enten scores the governor across two dimensions--his fundraising and his public statements--and compares him to similar scores from Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, which also include their congressional voting records. On a scale of 100 (most liberal) to -100 (most conservative), O'Malley scores a 33, which makes him a moderate liberal along the lines of Howard Dean in the 2004 election. But this isn't as liberal as Sanders, who scores a 61, or even Hillary Clinton, who scores a 50, making her substantially more liberal than her progressive challenger-in-the-making. A different scale, from political data group Crowdpac, shows a similar picture. On their scale, Sanders is much more liberal than Clinton, who is slightly more liberal than O'Malley. On its own, this isn't as big a stumbling block as it looks. Barack Obama made himself the liberal alternative in 2008 despite holding the same basic positions as Clinton. The difference is that then, liberals had organized their politics around a single, powerful issue--the Iraq War. As an early opponent of the war, Obama could harness the energy of an anti-war primary electorate and distinguish himself from competitors like Sen. John Edwards, who had the stature of a vice presidential nomination and a much more liberal vision for public policy. That kind of issue doesn't exist in 2015. Yes, inequality is salient to many Democratic voters, but it doesn't carry the same fire as the Iraq War. Or at least it could, if you had rhetorical skill. But for all of his qualities, O'Malley doesn't have rhetorical skill. He's the Seymour Skinner of the Democratic Party: More comfortable with budgets than stories, more fluent in the language of utility than he is in the poetry of a campaign. ""During the Obamacare debate,"" wrote Alec MacGillis for Slate last month, ""he chided Democrats who 'immediately run to the values of caring and fairness' instead of focusing on the economic case for health care reform."" His case against tax cuts for the rich is about ""doing the things that work,"" and--in the words of a middlebrow corporate consultant--he wants America to be an ""opportunity-expanding entity."" No, O'Malley might not put an audience to sleep, but you'd still want the smelling salts, just in case. In fairness, we could ignore O'Malley's problems with rhetoric and ideology if he were a daring leader for Maryland in his eight years as governor. The reality, however, is that he was often a follower in Annapolis; his progressive record has as much to do with liberal Democratic majorities in the state legislature as it does with his own ideas and approach. None of this is to say there isn't space in the Democratic primary for O'Malley, and he certainly knows what liberals want to hear. In the last month, he's called for tougher sanctions on banks and a reinstated Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law that separated commercial and investment banking. And in an interview with Salon, he stressed a need for policies that ""reward hard work and ... rein in reckless speculation that becomes destructive or predatory."" But compared to Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders or even the frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, O'Malley isn't especially compelling. And without a more progressive persona or at least better speechwriting, it's hard to see how he gets anyone's attention, much less topples the Democratic establishment."	Why Martin O'Malley Is Impersonating a Liberal
12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/why_it_matters_that_jeb_bush_defended_mike_pence_by_jbouie.html	"In the five days since he signed Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a cadre of athletes, activists, and business leaders have condemned and criticized Gov. Mike Pence for ostensibly giving state sanction to anti-gay discrimination. Typical is Apple CEO Tim Cook's admonition in the Washington Post: ""These bills rationalize injustice by pretending to defend something many of us hold dear. They go against the very principles our nation was founded on, and they have the potential to undo decades of progress toward greater equality."" Whether that's true is up for debate. Opponents say that by extending religious protections to businesses in lawsuits against private parties, the state gives cover to those who want to discriminate against same-sex couples, like the photographers and wedding bakers who inspired the measure. Proponents say that this is nonsense, and that the law is just an update to federal measures that protect individuals from undue burdens on their religious faith. Reasonable people can disagree on what the law means. But it's undeniable that political currents have moved away from proponents, threatening Indiana's standing as well as Pence and his administration. It's why, on Tuesday, the governor held a press conference where he asked Republican lawmakers to give him a bill that would ""fix"" the law, making it clear that ""this law does not give businesses the right to deny services to anyone."" He didn't specify the kind of language he wants, but he did restate his support--""This is about restraining government overreach""--and said he was ""grateful"" to those who defended Indiana and the law. Standing in solidarity with Pence are Republican presidential candidates, who--more than the governor with his proposed ""fix""--are wading against the stream of public opinion. The first GOP hopeful to defend Pence was Jeb Bush, the would-be consensus candidate who scores a real win by beating Sens. Ted Cruz and Rand Paul--the two men most clearly vying for conservative religious voters--to the punch. ""I think Gov. Pence has done the right thing,"" said Bush in an interview with Hugh Hewitt, an influential conservative radio host. ""I think once the facts are established, people aren't going to see this as discriminatory at all."" A few hours later, Cruz also piped up for Pence. ""Gov. Pence is holding the line to protect religious liberty in the Hoosier State,"" he said. ""Indiana is giving voice to millions of courageous conservatives across this country who are deeply concerned about the ongoing attacks upon our personal liberties."" Rubio denied that religious freedom laws were about discrimination--""Nobody is saying that it should be legal to deny someone service at a restaurant or at a hotel because of their sexual orientation""--while Ben Carson called such laws ""absolutely vital,"" and both Rick Santorum and Rick Perry have tweeted their support of the Indiana governor. Neither Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker nor Sen. Rand Paul nor Mike Huckabee has said anything public, but it's safe to assume that they--and other prospects like Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal--stand with the rest of the field. If religious freedom wasn't a core issue in the Republican presidential primary, it is now, to the point that National Review has pre-emptively disqualified Pence from the nomination for walking back in the face of criticism. ""This is craven capitulation,"" writes Quin Hillyer of Pence's call for clarification, declaring the governor ""unworthy of the presidency."" At this rate it won't be a shock if the eventual nominee endorses an update to the federal RFRA, aligning it with Indiana's measure and broadening its protections of religious practice. Put differently, this entire affair is a solid win for social conservatives, who now have inadvertently arrived at a broad commitment to an important priority. No one in the Republican presidential field will buck the consensus on religious freedom, and given the extent to which hopefuls like Cruz and Jindal will need to flank Bush from his right, there's a good chance the party position on religious freedom will move further to the right. Republican modernizers aren't so lucky. ""Religious freedom"" antagonizes traditionally Democratic groups as much as it mobilizes conservative voters. The backlash to the Indiana law is instructive. In a new poll from the Pew Research Center, 62 percent of young people, 61 percent of black Americans, and 56 percent of Latinos say that wedding-related businesses should have to provide services to same-sex couples. (What's interesting is that 59 percent of black Protestants agree, even as most oppose gay marriage. Perhaps possible discrimination is more salient to these respondents than the morality of same-sex weddings.) And while Pew doesn't expressly poll LGBT Americans, it's fair to assume they show even greater opposition. For the Republicans trying to strike anti-gay-marriage language from the party platform, this is a problem. If modern American politics is a struggle between older, whiter Americans and an ascendant coalition of diverse groups, then--outside the particular dynamic of the GOP--the embrace of religious-freedom laws is a blow to the party's broad appeal. This doesn't mean Republicans are doomed in next year's election. But if you're a Democratic legacy candidate who wants to mark yourself as a leader for the future and not a return to the past, your job is much easier if your opponents have tied themselves to the cultural resistance, and not the emergent vanguard."	Why It Matters That Jeb Bush Defended Mike Pence
13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/republicans_and_democrats_won_t_do_anything_to_fix_inequality_don_t_expect.html	"The wealthiest Americans don't care about inequality, and our presidential candidates are following their lead. That's not to say they aren't talking about inequality. They are, for anyone who will listen. As Noam Scheiber notes for the New York Times, Sens. Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Marco Rubio broached the issue in January, while Hillary Clinton discussed it at the Center for American Progress last week. But none of them have ideas for tackling the problem. Neither Cruz nor Paul nor Rubio was willing to say ""the government should intervene to solve it,"" while Clinton would rather retreat to platitudes--""We have to have a concerted effort to meet a consensus about how to deal with this""--than give solutions. That Republicans would reject a fix to income inequality is expected. The party--even its so-called ""reform"" conservatives--is committed to upper-income tax breaks and deep cuts to the social safety net. If the GOP sees a problem, it's too much redistribution to low-income Americans, and too little support for ""makers,"" ""job creators,"" and the idle rich. Clinton's silence, on the other hand, is disappointing. In the 2008 election, she sold herself as a fighter for working-class voters and union members, even as Barack Obama won endorsements from groups like the SEIU and the AFL-CIO. In a race where her past--from critiques of the ""coronation"" to her vote on the Iraq War--was a problem, this couldn't blunt Obama's appeal to a huge portion of the Democratic Party. In the age of Elizabeth Warren, however, it could be effective rhetoric for the eventual primary and the general election, where Democrats will need to break from the present administration, appeal to working Americans, and give an alternative to the Republican Party. But despite the obvious utility of a combative, working-class message--I will fight for your rights against the banks and the fat cats--it's not going to happen. So far, Clinton is more interested in consensus than conflict, and there's little chance that will change in her official presidential campaign. Put differently, Clinton has no interest in offending donors and other wealthy supporters. Or, as Scheiber writes, ""Though she derided the Republican practice of cutting taxes on the wealthy,"" writes Scheiber, ""she made no mention of tax increases or more aggressive measures, like capping the pay of chief executives or modestly taxing stock market transactions."" With that said, it's a little unfair to completely pin this on Clinton, who is responding to political incentives as much as she's following her own beliefs and priorities. If Clinton had an incentive to adopt more populist rhetoric and tout more populist policies, she would take it, as she did in the final months of the 2008 campaign, when she especially emphasized her appeal to working-class whites (while dipping into some ugly racial territory). No, the problem is that the Democratic Party lacks an institutional counterweight to the loud voices of wealthy donors and power brokers. There are unions, but they are weak, made brittle by declining membership and a new wave of ""right-to-work"" laws meant to undermine unions' ability to represent all workers in a shop, eroding their viability. And while there are other groups that advocate for progressive economic policy and solutions to inequality, there's no real substitute for unions and their broad influence among workers, activists, and lawmakers. Yes, unions were rough and unpolished, often hidebound and prone to corruption. But they were also a broad force for the interests of working- and middle-class Americans. They organized, advocated, and pressured Democrats from the left, acting against the corporate and financial interests that hold a large say in Washington. Their decline doesn't just correspond with the twilight of the social democratic vision in American politics--from the New Deal to the Great Society--it also corresponds with the overall decline of middle-class fortunes. There is no balance of economic and political power. Instead, we have corporate dominance with modest resistance from the remnants of organized labor. As such, not only is it difficult to create periods of progressive change--it took eight years of disaster and an economic crisis to create the conditions for 2008--but it's almost impossible to sustain them: The most productive period of Obama's presidency lasted two years. Since then, it's been defensive actions, rear-guard retreats, and the occasionally successful skirmish. Liberals want the Democratic Party to be an effective vehicle for economic liberalism. But without a countervailing force to challenge business interests and support the left over the long term--beyond the occasional insurgent candidacy in a presidential campaign--there's little hope for change. One way to understand the dynamic is to look at the success of social liberalism in the Democratic Party. Social liberals aren't just bolstered by activists; they have support from huge donors who support women's rights and powerful corporations who back LGBT rights. That Democrats are largely unified against laws like Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act reflects the degree to which stakeholders are undivided. It's the reverse for economic liberals, whose modest position in the party isn't strong enough to compel commitment to an agenda. In 2009, liberals wanted ""card check"" in the Employee Free Choice Act, but they couldn't compel moderates to come along. It died. Maybe, in the medium term, we'll see a political alternative to unions. Until then, liberals are the minority partner in economic policymaking. Clinton will not challenge the wealthiest members of the Democratic coalition, and if she isn't the nominee--if we end up with someone like Elizabeth Warren--we should expect the same. It's the party that decides policy, not the candidate, and if the party isn't interested in a serious challenge to economic inequality, then even with Warren at the top, it's not going to happen."	Where Have All the Populists Gone?
14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/ted_cruz_and_other_republican_party_presidential_candidates_agree_on_almost.html	"Campaigning for the presidency, the Republican senator from the Southwest warned that government should undertake ""only those needed and constitutionally sanctioned tasks which cannot otherwise be performed."" He condemned the incumbent in the White House ""for timidly refusing to draw our own lines against aggression ... and letting our finest men die on battlefields (unmarked by purpose ... or the prospect of victory)."" He proudly stated that ""this nation was founded ... upon the acceptance of God as the author of freedom"" and scorned liberals who ""elevate the state and downgrade the citizen."" Sen. Ted Cruz could have made those remarks during his address at Liberty University last week, when he announced his campaign for the White House. He certainly agrees with all of them. But it was a different right-wing firebrand from the Sun Belt who uttered those lines more than 50 years ago: Arizona's Barry Goldwater, in his speech accepting the 1964 Republican nomination for president. Whatever you think about conservative Republicans, you have to admire their rhetorical consistency. From Goldwater to Reagan to George W. Bush to the current junior senator from Texas, nearly every nationally prominent politician on the right has upheld the same three-part credo: limited government at home, military intervention against enemies abroad, and America as God's chosen land, which only those who cherish ""traditional"" religious values should govern. Fellow lawmakers may mistrust Cruz for preening as a lonely fighter for truth. But no GOP politician with a serious chance to be nominated next year disagrees with his message of updated Goldwaterism. Substitute Obamacare for Medicare and ISIS and Iran for the Soviet Union and China, and Gov. Scott Walker, Sen. Marco Rubio, Mike Huckabee, and even the allegedly ""moderate"" Jeb Bush would gladly sign on. Each man also fervently connects his personal faith to the idea that the Almighty has a special fondness for the United States. Sen. Rand Paul's qualms about using the full force of the U.S. military against armed Islamists may endear him to libertarian-minded millennials. But such ambivalence will insure his defeat in a party that has longed prized bellicosity for a righteous cause. Adhering to an easily understood and deeply felt ideology has helped conservatives win impressive victories. After Goldwater lost the 1964 election in a landslide, they kept building their movement, taking advantage of the failure of Democratic administrations and Congresses to contain communism or soothe the rising fears of white Americans about black criminals, rebellious youths, and uppity gays and feminists. They persuaded evangelical churchgoers, anti-regulation and anti-union employers, and intellectual Cold Warriors to unite against the common enemy of secular liberalism. They elected three avowedly conservative presidents and now control both houses of Congress and wield, in effect, a majority on the Supreme Court. Of course, the right's big tent has not been free of conflict. George Will and Pat Buchanan railed at the messianic ambitions of George W. Bush's foreign policy, and increasing numbers of Republican politicians no longer favor banning same-sex marriage. Still, the conservative movement has held together remarkably well for more than five decades--a longevity achieved by no other major ideological formation in American political history. Contrast that accomplishment with the fragmentation of liberals--or ""progressives""--into separate, often mutually suspicious, identities (black, Latino, LGBT, feminist) and interests (tech moguls vs. labor unions) since the 1960s. Progressives did manage to unite behind Barack Obama's two campaigns for president. But many now complain that the president's policy successes and political skills did not live up to his rhetoric. And, so far at least, they have been unable to convince another compelling figure who shares their passions to run against Hillary Clinton, who once beamed from the House gallery as her husband announced, ""The era of big government is over."" However, the durability of the right's ideological formula is a weakness as well as a strength. It forces conservatives in power to contradict their rhetoric on almost a daily basis. How else can they curse Obamacare as ""socialist,"" a program that requires most Americans to buy private insurance while praising and funding Medicare and Social Security, the largest and sturdiest pillars of the welfare state? How else can they call, as Cruz did last week, for a future of liberty in which ""government regulators and tax collectors are kept at bay"" but demand regular budget increases for the military and the rest of the national security apparatus--probably the most heavily regulated, and certainly the most secretive, arm of the federal government? Veteran politicians on the right understand that the public is guilty of the same type of hypocrisy. As two wise political scientists put it back in 1967, most American voters are ""ideological conservatives but operational liberals."" They dislike ""big"" government but support, and often depend on, any government program that directly benefits them. But in their hypocrisy, powerful conservatives are pandering to this schizoid attitude instead of facing up to problems such as global warming and income inequality that require smart regulation and at least a modest redistribution of wealth. They don't really attempt to limit government as much as they try to limit programs that don't help their core voters or key donors. Compared with Cruz and his fellow 2016 hopefuls, Goldwater was actually a model of consistency in 1964: He opposed Medicare, wanted to make Social Security a voluntary program, and voted against the Civil Rights Act because it gave the federal government the power to ban racial discrimination by employers, hotels, and restaurants. He wasn't a racist, but he thought such power should be left to the states. But then as a man of steadfast principle, he knew something that no Republican who is now or will soon be campaigning for the White House believes: Goldwater knew he was going to lose."	Why All the Republican Party's Presidential Candidates Believe the Same Thing
15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/04/hillary_clinton_and_campaign_finance_the_democratic_front_runner_s_suggestion.html	"People are deservedly angry about the unprecedented flow of money into our elections. On Wednesday a postal worker literally risked his life to land a gyrocopter near the U.S. Capitol to protest the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United. The group 99Rise keeps risking jail time by sneaking into the Supreme Court and surreptitiously filming protesters' outbursts in open court against decisions that have construed the First Amendment to prohibit most limits on money in politics. So it is understandable that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is trying to harness some of that progressive energy by announcing that campaign finance reform is one of the ""four big fights"" that her campaign will emphasize. But Clinton's early call for a constitutional amendment to fix campaign finance problems is counterproductive and will only make things worse. Speaking at a campaign event in Iowa on Tuesday, Clinton declared: ""We need to fix our dysfunctional political system and get unaccountable money out of it once and for all, even if it takes a constitutional amendment."" Clinton is right that we have a big problem with money in politics. From Sheldon Adelson and his wife spending $98 million to $150 million in the 2012 elections to promote Republicans, to environmentalist Tom Steyer spending more than $70 million to promote Democratic Senate candidates in the 2014 elections, to the Koch brothers' pledge to have their network spend a staggering $889 million in the 2016 elections, we run the risk of our electoral and political system being run by only the wealthiest in society. And thanks to holes in our disclosure system, much of the money contributed to outside groups goes undisclosed, so the public has no idea who is behind the flood of ads aimed at influencing our political choices. But a constitutional amendment is a terrible way to try to fix the problem. To begin with, to the extent Clinton is concerned simply about undisclosed political money, she should put efforts into fixing the nation's disclosure laws, something that requires congressional legislation or action from the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Election Commission. There is no need for a constitutional amendment to fix our disclosure laws. Indeed, say what you want about the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, but in its decision the court did offer a ringing endorsement of disclosure laws as constitutionally permissible and even desirable. Clinton seems to want to do more than deal with undisclosed money; she railed against ""unaccountable"" money, the money coming from non-party groups such as super PACs, which were unleashed by court rulings and administrative decisions after Citizens United. These groups can take unlimited sums from individuals, corporations, and others to fund election-related activity so long as the activity is independent of candidates. A constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United in theory could deal with this problem. But it too is a bad idea. To begin with, it is hard to write an amendment that would be effective in overturning Citizens United without running the risk of squelching too much political speech. Consider what happened when Democrats proposed a constitutional amendment on campaign finance last summer. When Sen. Ted Cruz, now also a presidential candidate, took to the floor of the U.S. Senate to denounce the measure as allowing the government to throw Saturday Night Live producer Lorne Michaels in jail for political satire, Democrats changed the amendment to allow for only ""reasonable"" limits on reform. By inserting the word reasonable, Democrats would effectively kick the issue back to the courts. Why would anyone think any newly enacted corporate spending limits following a constitutional amendment would be seen as ""reasonable"" by a conservative majority of the Roberts court? Aside from the fact that it is hard to write a constitutional amendment neither draconian nor ineffective, the amendment proposal is a political nonstarter. Even if Democrats retake control of the Senate in 2016, there is no supermajority in the Senate (and very unlikely to be even a vote in a Republican House) to overturn Citizens United. An amendment requires not only a vote of two-thirds of each House of Congress, but also approval of three-quarters of the state legislatures. Many Republicans are quite happy with the Citizens United era, and there is no way a campaign finance amendment will pass these days. Clinton's call for a constitutional amendment is really just one thing: red meat for Democratic activists. It is a game President Obama has played for years. On the one hand, he has railed against Citizens United and the conservative Supreme Court. On the other hand, he has taken a number of steps to push campaign finance boundaries even further, such as being the first sitting president to set up a 501(c)(4) organization to support his agenda. The president has offered lip service and little else in his time in office. And those same Senate Democrats who favored a constitutional amendment recently pushed a bill to dramatically raise the amount of money individuals can give as contributions to political parties. So what should Clinton do? First, she should support legislation that is possible under the Citizens United regime, including improved disclosure and innovative public financing solutions, such as vouchers. These fixes will not stem the flow of money in politics, but they would ameliorate some of the worst problems. Longer term, Clinton needs to work to replace retiring Supreme Court justices with those who will overturn Citizens United and more. These days it is much easier to change the Constitution by changing the Supreme Court than by passing an amendment. A serious conversation about campaign finance reform should begin with serious proposals, not with political posturing and pipe dreams."	Hillary Clinton's Bad Campaign Finance Ideas
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/04/barack_obama_s_clean_scandal_free_presidency_the_president_s_legacy_is_a.html	"We are due for a major presidential scandal. At least, that's been the pattern for three of the last four administrations. By this point in 1987, President Reagan had fought through the Iran-Contra affair. By this point in 1999, President Clinton was coping with fallout from his impeachment. And by this point in 2007, President Bush was dealing with continued revelations into the torture at Abu Ghraib and the criminal investigation of a former aide, Scooter Libby (to say nothing of a failing economy and an unpopular war launched with bad intelligence in Iraq). These events were important to their legacies and reputations, but less so for their careers. They were two-term presidents; voters weren't a concern. That task would fall to their potential successors, who would have to navigate the controversies and convince voters that they were different. George H.W. Bush sold himself as a more active, responsible Republican who wouldn't be guilty of Reagan's occasional aloofness. Al Gore tried, unsuccessfully, to distance himself from Clinton's misconduct, choosing a running mate known for his religious faith. And Sen. John McCain worked hard against the charge that he was Dubya Part Deux. Bush won, while Gore and McCain were less lucky. In each case though, the candidates--and the parties--were burdened by the scandals of their predecessors. And for good reason. Iran-Contra involved illegal arm sales to guerrillas and authoritarian regimes; Clinton was the first president to be impeached since Andrew Johnson; and George W. Bush had authorized torture of detainees, violating longstanding American practice and facilitating a wide parade of human rights abuses. In each case, the criticism was bipartisan, with wide condemnation from across the ideological spectrum. Democrats condemned Clinton for Lewinsky; Republicans condemned Bush for torture. Fast forward to the present. President Obama isn't a stranger to mishaps, mistakes, and improprieties. His attorney general, Eric Holder, faced contempt of Congress over a failed ""gunwalking"" operation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; his State Department was raked over coals for the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya; his Internal Revenue Service was criticized for rejecting nonprofit applications from conservative groups; he was savaged for the initial failure of healthcare.gov, and his Secret Service has had to deal with questions of basic competence and accountability. But unlike Iran-Contra or Clinton's impeachment, none of these were consequential for Obama's presidency. ""Fast and Furious"" ended with a whimper. An outside investigation from Fortune magazine--as well as investigations from House Republicans and the inspector general of the Justice Department--found no evidence that Holder (or the White House) was involved with the operation. Likewise, in the 21/2 years since the tragedy in Benghazi, five congressional committees and the State Department's Accountability Review Board have released reports on the attacks. The latest one, from the House Select Intelligence Committee, is an almost full exoneration of White House officials that debunks the conspiracies around the event. According to the GOP-penned report, there was no stand down of military support, no intelligence failure prior to the attacks, no false White House talking points, and no cover-up of evidence. No one blames Obama for the Secret Service fiascos, and while the IRS business looked like a serious scandal, subsequent scrutiny turned up practically nothing. A Senate report found ""no evidence of IRS political bias"" in the agency's actions, while a report from the House Oversight Committee failed to find coordination between IRS officials and political operatives in the White House. Even the most critical reports--which condemned the IRS for an alleged ""inability to keep politics out of objective decisions about interpretation of the tax code""--didn't connect agency behavior to the president. The general conclusion--condemnation aside--was that the IRS had gone too far in trying to keep political advocacy groups from claiming tax-exempt status. Healthcare.gov could have been a catastrophe, but the administration quickly moved to repair the damage. By Christmas--less than three months after its awful debut--the site was working. By the end of the first enrollment period, it was processing new applications at a brisk pace, and as of this month, more than 9 million people have applied for insurance through healthcare.gov. The site, by any measure, is a success. Conservatives will huff and harrumph to the contrary, but relative to his peers, Obama has had a remarkably clean, scandal-free presidency. Unlike Reagan, he hasn't had to offer a national apology. Unlike Clinton, he hasn't had to face a special prosecutor. And unlike George W. Bush, he hasn't had to answer to something like the 9/11 Commission. He's had scandals, but not the kind that bring intra-party criticism--a sure sign that the offense is serious--or force a massive public reckoning. This isn't a matter of polarization either. When the IRS scandal broke, Democrats as well as Republicans called for investigations. As it withered, however, it became a more partisan affair. For Democrats in the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections, this didn't mean much. For Hillary Clinton, however, it's a real advantage. As it stands, she's tied to President Obama. Not only did she serve in his administration, but her personal popularity has moved in tandem with his. Her favorability is at 48.9 percent. His is at 48.5 percent. Put simply, there's nothing Clinton can do to escape Obama's legacy. But she doesn't need to. Unlike with McCain and Bush or Gore and Bill Clinton, there is no Obama scandal fatigue or general exhaustion with Democrats. Forty-six percent of Americans have a favorable view of the Democratic Party, and majorities say that Democrats are ""open and tolerant, care about the middle-class, and not too extreme."" There's also no particular anger or displeasure at Obama from the general public. His job approval has inched back into positive territory, and for the first time in five years, more Americans say his economic policies have made conditions better than worse--38 percent versus 28 percent. Far from being a burden on Clinton's bid, Obama is an asset. Which is why the campaign will embrace him. Not just as a conduit to black American voters, but as a good president whose policies should be continued and extended. No, this doesn't equate to an inevitable Clinton victory, and the public may still want a change of pace after eight years of Democrats. But for Democratic partisans, it's far preferable to the alternative world where Clinton is desperately running away from the president and his administration. Indeed, for as much as liberals have complained about Obama's stoicism in the face of almost everything, that same quality is poised to give Democrats a key bonus in the game: Stability. And when Republicans warn of a ""third Obama term,"" Clinton can flip that as a good thing."	Obama's Gift to Hillary Clinton

He gives several examples. One is the letter from 47 Republican senators advising Iran not to trust Obama's promises in a nuclear deal. Another is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's warning to foreign leaders that Obama's domestic opponents won't cooperate in any climate change plan he approves. The last straw was an allegation on Thursday from Sen. John McCain, the GOP's 2008 presidential nominee, that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is lying about the terms of the Iran nuclear deal and that Americans should instead believe the contrary account given by Iran's dictator. Obama calls these developments a breach of precedent. Last week, he told New York Times columnist Tom Friedman: ""I do worry that some traditional boundaries in how we think about foreign policy have been crossed."" Traditional boundaries? Sorry, but those traditions died long ago. If you study Republican behavior over the past quarter-century, you'll find that the image of conservative lawmakers standing resolutely for American strength and unity is a myth. Republicans support wars launched by Republican presidents. When Democratic presidents undertake wars or negotiations, Republicans generally attempt to sabotage them. In fact, Republicans often side with our enemies. President Clinton faced one big war. In 1999, he sought to enlist the United States in NATO's air campaign in Serbia. The campaign aimed to stop the ethnic cleansing of Muslims in Kosovo. When a resolution authorizing U.S. participation in the war came before the Senate, Democrats voted for it, 42 to 3. Republicans voted against it, 38 to 16. The resolution went through, but it failed a month later with a tie vote in the House. Democrats voted for the resolution, 181 to 25. Republicans voted against it, 187 to 31. Four of the five Republican leaders in Congress--Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, and House Majority Whip Tom DeLay--voted against the resolution. So did Rep. John Boehner, who had just completed his tenure as chairman of the House Republican Conference. DeLay also voted for a resolution declaring that the House ""directs the President to remove United States Armed Forces from their positions in connection with the present operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."" Republican leaders didn't just try to block the president. They defended Serbian dictator Slobodan Milosevic. When Gen. Joseph Ralston, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Milosevic ""had already started his campaign of killing"" before NATO intervened, Nickles disagreed. ""I would take a little issue with [what] Gen. Ralston said,"" the senator retorted. ""The number of killings prior to the bombing, I think, has been exaggerated."" DeLay and Nickles blamed the ethnic cleansing on the United States and NATO. Nickles said NATO's peace proposal to the Serbs--which Milosevic had rejected, leading to the war--had been ""very arrogant."" Lott agreed. He accused the United States of not doing ""enough in the diplomatic area"" to appease Milosevic, and he urged Clinton to ""give peace a chance."" Nickles dismissed NATO's mission as ""ludicrous."" DeLay functioned as a propaganda minister for Milosevic, bucking up Serbian morale and belittling NATO's efforts. ""He's stronger in Kosovo now than he was before the bombing,"" DeLay said of Milosevic. ""The Serbian people are rallying around him like never before. He's much stronger with his allies."" When U.S. officials suggested that Milosevic was losing strength, DeLay dismissed this as disinformation from ""the president's spin machine."" DeLay concluded that ""the bombing was a mistake"" and that ""this president ought to ... admit it and come to some sort of negotiated end."" The Republicans were wrong. NATO's pressure forced Milosevic to capitulate, and the ethnic cleansing stopped. Then came the 2000 election, the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Republicans didn't just support these wars. They portrayed anyone who questioned them, even tactically, as a traitor. But in 2008, the GOP lost the White House, and its attitude toward presidential authority turned hostile again. Republicans' hostility focused not on Afghanistan or Iraq--the wars for which they couldn't escape responsibility--but on Libya, which they could safely portray as Obama's conflict. Throughout the 2011 Libya campaign and the 2012 election, they mocked Obama for ""leading from behind"" in Libya. Many Republicans said we should never have entered the war, since Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi hadn't attacked the United States and posed no immediate threat to us. Rep. Michele Bachmann, a presidential candidate and darling of the right, suggested that the U.S.-led NATO strikes in Libya had killed 10,000 to 30,000 innocent civilians. She cited, as her source for this claim, Qaddafi's regime. In the 2012 presidential debates, former GOP House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other Republicans agreed with much of her criticism. ""Two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is a lot,"" Gingrich argued in an NBC News interview. He accused Obama of going to war in Libya for the United Nations and the Arab League instead of ""looking at American interests."" ""We could get engaged by this standard in all sorts of places,"" Gingrich objected. He concluded: ""I would not have intervened."" While the presidential candidates criticized the war, Republicans in Congress tried to stop it. Two months into the bombing campaign, House Speaker John Boehner sponsored and pushed through a resolution declaring that Obama had ""failed to provide Congress with a compelling rationale based upon United States national security interests for current United States military activities regarding Libya."" The resolution forbade Obama from using U.S. ground forces and warned him that ""Congress has the constitutional prerogative to withhold funding for any unauthorized use of the United States Armed Forces."" Democrats opposed the resolution, but Republicans passed it, voting 223 to 10 in favor. Republican efforts to sabotage the U.S. war effort were so persistent and vigorous that Qaddafi sent a letter to members of Congress thanking them. The letter, issued a week after the House adopted Boehner's resolution, told lawmakers: ""We are counting on the United States Congress [for] its continued investigation of military activities of NATO and its allies."" Qaddafi's letter offended McCain. In a Senate floor speech, the senator chided his colleagues:"	Why Do Republicans Keep Siding With America's Enemies?
18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/04/marco_rubio_s_poor_chances_to_win_the_presidency_the_florida_senator_is.html	"On Monday, in Miami, Sen. Marco Rubio announced his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. The Florida senator finds himself in an unusual position. Unlike Sens. Ted Cruz or Rand Paul--two factional candidates with roots in the far-right--he has a decent shot at success; he's hired top-notch political talent and has solid support among major donors. But unlike Gov. Scott Walker or Jeb Bush, he's no one's first choice. Instead, he's everyone's second choice, with clear advantages--strong speaking skills, a fantastic biography, an ambitious agenda, and a flair for retail politics--and real weaknesses, namely, a modest record in the Senate. He's acceptable to almost everyone in the GOP--56 percent of Republican voters say they could vote for him--but he's no one's favorite: Just 5.4 percent list him as a top choice for the nomination. More so than most, Rubio is a serious and viable candidate for the Republican presidential ticket. But save a catastrophe in both the Bush and Walker camps, it's hard to see how he has a path to the prize. In fairness, you could have said the same for a certain Illinois senator in 2007, as he faced the Clinton machine and a former vice presidential candidate. But while Barack Obama also lacked any major accomplishments, he also lacked any major failures or concrete liabilities. Rubio isn't so lucky. His introduction to the national public--his 2013 State of the Union response--was somewhere between a gaffe and a disaster, and his attempt to play conservative reformer--a yearlong push for immigration reform--ended in failure, as grassroots Republicans rejected his deal on citizenship and border security. The next year, Rubio recalibrated. Among the first major Republicans to endorse Joni Ernst in her Iowa Senate bid, he stumped for her campaign and supported her in a tough Republican primary, earning goodwill with conservative activists in the state. He backed down on immigration reform--taking the mainstream GOP position of no ""amnesty"" (""[Y]ou don't have a right to illegally immigrate into the United States""), proposed a new expansion to the Earned Income Tax Credit, and joined with Utah Sen. Mike Lee to produce a tax reform plan that aims for the Republican sweet spot of affluent families and large business owners with large, regressive tax cuts. Now, Rubio is in decent shape. With few outright enemies in the Republican Party, he's as close to a potential consensus candidate as you can imagine. His problem is he's not alone. The Florida senator is a fine candidate, but depending on your place in the GOP, there are potentially better options. If you're a conservative who wants consensus and a more inclusive message, you have Jeb Bush, who melds Rubio's potential appeal to Latino voters (his wife is Mexican, and he speaks fluent Spanish) with executive experience, fundraising prowess, and the all the benefits (and burdens) of the Bush name. Likewise, if you want a more aggressive choice--someone with the chops it takes to beat Democrats and advance a conservative agenda--you have Walker, the right-wing, more grassroots alternative to Bush, who has some of Rubio's youth--he's just six years older than the junior senator from Florida--but with much more experience. If you're a conservative evangelical eager for a champion, there's Cruz (and potentially Mike Huckabee), and if you want a more libertarian choice, there's Paul. Rubio may appeal to every base, but every base is already covered. His only hope is for those candidates--and Bush and Walker in particular--to tear themselves apart. For them to wound each other, make fatal mistakes, and eventually open the space for a viable alternative. It's a version of Sen. John McCain's strategy in 2008, and it's Rubio's best chance for the nomination. It's also unlikely, and even if it happened, he would have to pounce and take the moment as soon as it appeared, which--as evidenced by the long-list of almost candidates and one-time hopefuls--is incredibly difficult. But if there's anything Rubio excels at, it's precisely that. Whether it's a shot for comprehensive immigration reform or a sense that Republicans are looking for more than a small-ball agenda, Rubio knows when to seize the moment and run. It's why he's already in the White House game, just four years after stepping on the national stage; like Obama before him, Rubio knows that the best time to run for president is always now. Will he win the Republican nomination? Probably not. But a lot of politics is about unlikely bets, and given his position in the Republican Party, Rubio is smart to make this one.

19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/04/hillary_clinton_s_presidential_campaign_is_vital_for_the_future_of_the_democratic.html	"""Everyday Americans need a champion. And I want to be that champion."" With that, at the end of a two-minute video released Sunday, Hillary Clinton announced her second campaign for the presidency. This is not a surprise. For the last three years--and arguably, since the 2008 presidential election--she's been working toward this moment. Now, after persuading skeptics and winning new allies, she is the consensus choice of the Democratic Party. And for all the problems that come with an openly uncontested nomination fight, this is arguably the best of all present outcomes. The party is neither as favored nor as unified as it appears, and for all of her flaws, Clinton is the best chance it has for keeping the White House. It's worth looking back to 2007, when Republicans were fighting to hold the Oval Office. George W. Bush began the year with abysmal approval ratings, the GOP had lost both chambers of Congress, and the economy was weak, slowing down to an eventual recession. Compared with this, Barack Obama and the Democrats look OK. Yes, they faced a second midterm wave in four years and lost the Senate--ceding control to the GOP--but as of this month, the president is more popular than he has been in a year, with an average approval rating of 46 percent. And while his legislative agenda has long since stalled, he's made ample use of executive authority to protect his core accomplishment--the Affordable Care Act--and advance priorities in immigration, climate change, and civil rights. But none of that will stand if the Democratic Party can't win in 2016. And while Obama and the Democrats aren't as bad off as Bush and the Republicans were in 2007, they're not in a good place either. At 32 percent, according to a November survey from the Pew Research Center, Democratic Party identification is at its lowest point since 2008 (although Republican Party identification remains in the high 20s). Likewise, pluralities of Americans don't trust Democrats to handle core issues like the economy and foreign policy. In a Gallup survey last November, after the election, 53 percent of respondents said they wanted Republicans to have more influence than Obama. And in a March CNN poll, 57 percent said they wanted the next president to change most of the policies of the present administration. There's an argument--a strong one--that the Democratic Party holds a natural advantage in presidential elections. From the get-go, when you tally the electoral votes of reliably ""blue"" states in the Northeast, the Rust Belt, and the West Coast, Democrats start with a 37 electoral vote advantage over Republicans, 190 to 153. If you add lean Democratic and lean Republican states to the mix--places where a party consistently wins with margins between 5 and 10 percentage points--Democrats start the 2016 presidential election with 257 electoral votes out of the 270 they need to win. Add Virginia to the total--which has gone blue in four out of its last five statewide elections--and Democrats have the presidency. But this model is deceptive in that it assumes static conditions: a growing economy, relative peace, and either a popular Democratic incumbent (as in 2012) or an unpopular Republican president (as in 2008). If we continue on our current course, we'll have a growing economy in 2016.  And barring a new war, we'll have relative peace. But we may also have an unpopular Democratic president and a public that--after eight years--will likely want a change of pace. In that environment, anything can happen. Democrats could capture the presidency, or their national strength could collapse as the country swings to the Republican Party. It doesn't help that Democrats are in modest disarray. Despite Obama's political success and powerful legacy--the first Democrat since Franklin Roosevelt to command a majority of the popular vote in two elections and the first black president and the namesake to the largest social safety net expansion since Lyndon Johnson's Great Society--the president presides over a divided party. One wing, personified by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, is furious with Obama's relationship to Wall Street, his penchant for compromise, and his willingness to always take a half loaf--to rarely take a stand against his ideological opponents. They wanted a president who would speak to their concerns, who would reverse the Bush years and usher in a new progressive era. They have had scathing criticism for Obama's economic and foreign policies, and they want to preserve the best of his tenure--such that it is--while making a definitive break with the style and conduct of his administration. ""Enough is enough with Wall Street insiders getting key position after key position and the kind of cronyism that we have seen in the executive branch,"" said Warren in a fiery December speech on the Senate floor. ""Enough is enough with Citigroup passing 11th-hour deregulatory provisions that nobody takes ownership over but everybody will come to regret. Enough is enough."" The other wing is the mainstream of the Democratic Party. It's content with the progress of the Obama administration and more interested in protecting its gains from a radical-minded Republican Party than expanding the possible of liberal politics. You can see some of this instinct for self-preservation in the reactions of the midterm wipeout, as some senior Democrats-- like New York Sen. Chuck Schumer--searched for something that could have saved their majority from the GOP. ""Unfortunately, Democrats lost the opportunity the American people gave them. We took their mandate and put all of our focus on the wrong problem--health care reform,"" said Schumer in a November speech at the National Press Club in Washington. Ideologically, this wing hasn't tried to grapple with the shifting winds of Democratic politics. The best example of this was the December funding fight, where the White House and its allies sacrificed parts of Dodd-Frank financial reform in order to fund the government for the next fiscal year. The political logic was sound: Cutting a deal with a Democratic Senate and a Republican House in a lame duck session is much preferable to cutting a deal with GOP majorities in both chambers. But the attack on financial reform--led by Democrats and Republicans--enraged liberals, who--led by Warren--tried to scuttle the bill and shut down the government. The White House eventually prevailed, but not before further angering anti-Wall Street liberals. All of this is to say that if presidential primaries are places where parties define themselves, then 2016 has the makings of a real struggle, where Democrats fight to chart a direction for the next decade. Or it would, if not for Clinton. What Hillary Clinton Means for the Democratic Party It's fitting that Hillary Clinton stands as the natural successor to President Obama. Savvy and politically ambitious, she leveraged her time as first lady to win a Senate seat, run a path-breaking presidential campaign, and serve four years as secretary of state in the Obama White House. Now, she's one of the most popular political figures in the country. HuffPost Pollster's average gives her a 48 percent favorable and 46 percent unfavorable rating.  As an isolated number, that sounds just OK. But consider this: President Obama has a 48 percent favorable rating and a 48 percent unfavorable rating.  Vice President Joe Biden has a 42 percent favorable rating and 45 percent unfavorable rating, and outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid--albeit less well-known than the president and vice president--has a 23 percent favorable rating and a 43 percent unfavorable rating. Even Warren--crusader of the Democratic left--has just a 30 percent favorable rating (and a 33 percent unfavorable rating as well). If Clinton were unknown, this might be a problem. But she's among the most known figures in politics. An almost 50 percent favorable rating, put differently, is fairly impressive. Among Democrats, there's no competition. In the most recent average, Clinton takes nearly 60 percent of the primary vote. Her next two competitors--Warren and Biden--take 12 percent each. By contrast, in 2007, she was just a modest favorite for the nomination. The answer for why Clinton is so popular (among Democrats, at least) is easy: Not only is she strongly associated with one of the most well-liked presidents in recent memory--her husband, Bill Clinton--but she also retains considerable goodwill from her first presidential campaign and her service in Obama's State Department, where she disproved the idea that she's only in the game for herself. This is why it's wrong to call her triumph a ""coronation."" If Clinton has the overwhelming support of the Democratic Party network--from donors and establishment figures to activists and ordinary voters--it's because she earned it, the dividends paid after eight years of hard work. Likewise, Clinton isn't a ""dynasty"" candidate; her White House time gave her a shot at a career, but by this point, she's earned her spot near the top of American politics. And as for Clinton versus Republicans? Neither Jeb Bush (33 percent favorable, 49 percent unfavorable), Scott Walker (26 percent favorable, 27 percent unfavorable), nor Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (30 percent favorable, 31 percent unfavorable) have comparable ratings. Indeed, there's no one of Hillary Clinton's visibility and prominence who is as popular as she is. Clinton's popularity isn't an idle observation. It's the defining fact of the present Democratic Party. Clinton's strength--her influence across the breadth of the Democratic Party--is a unifying force. Polls make it clear that almost every constituency in the party, from liberals and blue dogs to black Americans and working-class whites, is ready for her candidacy. The ideological divide in the Democratic coalition--the fight between Wall Street-friendly Democrats in the center and populist Democrats on the left--is dampened by her presence, not because of any sudden love or affection, but because the various factions see Clinton as the key to keeping the White House and saving the gains of the Obama administration from a far right--and come 2016, restless--Republican Party. It's no surprise that the bulk of the Democratic Party machinery has fallen behind Clinton. Given the stakes, no one wants open warfare. At the same time, it's not as if she isn't on a side. Clinton is tightly tied to the centrist mainstream of the Democratic Party. Not only was she part of the ""Third Way"" of pro-market reform Democrats in the 1990s, but she was also a New York senator who voted for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And in the years since, she's maintained her hawkishness (as revealed in her 2014 book, Hard Choices) and her ties to Wall Street. In a sense, the fact of her strength is a sign that anti-Wall Street Democrats are weak, that they can't actually contest political leadership of the party. Of course, there are other ways to lead. What About Elizabeth Warren? For the last year, Warren has fielded one relentless question from the Washington press corps: Are you running for president? In December 2013, after writer Noam Scheiber suggested it in a story for the New Republic, she denied the thought. ""I am not running for president,"" Warren said. ""I am working as hard as I can to be the best possible senator that I can be and to fight for the things that I promised during my campaign to fight for."" During the tour for her book, A Fighting Chance, she was asked, and she answered. ""I'm not running for president,"" said Warren to an audience of enthusiastic supporters. And after her recent crusade against a spending bill that weakened Dodd-Frank--yielding a viral speech in which she slammed ""cronyism"" in the ""executive branch""--Warren told NPR host Steve Inskeep that she wasn't running. Four times. Despite Warren's support for a Clinton candidacy--she signed a letter endorsing Hillary last year--and her willingness to forgive Clinton for supporting pro-Wall Street legislation, the assumption for the past year has been that Warren must have a challenge in mind. After all, the most vocal Republican senators--Rubio, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz--are all angling for the nomination, and Warren--with her unabashed liberalism and strident attacks on opponents--has more in common with them than she does quieter, less media-savvy senators. But there's another possibility: Warren isn't running for president; she's trying to build influence. Elizabeth Warren, to borrow an argument from the Washington Post's Dana Milbank, is the Democrats' Jim DeMint, an ideological leader for a ""left-wing analogue to the Tea Party."" Warren, Milbank notes, has rallied liberals to oppose White House deals and White House nominees, like investment banker Antonio Weiss, Obama's pick for the No. 3 position at the Treasury Department. DeMint ""cared about policy and took a long view of politics,"" and Warren seems to be following suit. What she wants is to set the agenda for the party and the nominee, to ensure that any Democrat who runs for president is also committed to a set of core issues. Which is just another way to say that Warren doesn't want to beat Clinton as much as she wants to pull her to the left. As a candidate, Warren can't do this--Clinton is just too strong. But as someone who can claim allegiance from other factions and give a seal of approval, she might succeed. And what would all of this mean in practice? Potentially, it means a Clinton who is less solicitous of Wall Street; less interested in small, incremental solutions; and unafraid of conservative attacks on core liberal priorities. It's a Clinton who might push bold proposals for expanded Social Security and a ""public option"" for the Affordable Care Act. It's a long shot, but it's potentially the only chance liberal Democrats have to reorient the party for the next 10 years. If Clinton is too powerful to beat outright, then the next best option is to do as much as possible to co-opt her platform. A World Without Hillary Clinton? To underscore the Democrats' plight, as a thought experiment, imagine if Clinton didn't run. Then the Democrats would have a problem. Well, two problems. First, as previously mentioned, the ideological fights in the party would spill out into the open. The unity created by Clinton would fall apart, as centrist Democrats fought to retain their influence and liberal Democrats fought to displace it. In this world, you might see a Warren candidacy, and you'd certainly see efforts from the handful of Democratic politicians with ambitions in 2016. That means former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb--who have both taken the earliest and most unambiguous steps toward declaring a candidacy--as well as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an ""independent socialist,"" and, potentially, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who has made moves in the direction of a candidacy. You'll notice that these are somewhat obscure names. One of the real problems of the Democratic Party, both for 2016 and looking forward, is the extent to which it lacks a bench of nationally viable leaders. It's not just that, if Clinton didn't run, Democrats would have to choose from a group of unknown and unfamiliar faces. It's also that--across all offices--the party has a shocking lack of new talent. ""Today,"" wrote Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report after the 2014 elections, ""about 55 percent of all state legislative seats in the country are held by Republicans. That's the largest share of GOP state legislators since the 1920s."" What's more, ""just 11 states have an all Democratic-controlled legislature,"" and Democrats hold single-party control in just seven states. By contrast, ""Republicans have a legislative majority in 30 states, including the battleground states of Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina,"" and single-party control in most of the South. Not only do Republicans stand to control the redistricting process in 2020--solidifying their majority in the House of Representatives--but they also have a huge farm team of new candidates. To that point, two of the brightest stars of the GOP's 2014 class--Sens. Joni Ernst of Iowa and Thom Tillis of North Carolina--came from state legislatures. Democrats are less lucky. Their losses mean only a few places stand as incubators for progressive ideas, strategies, and candidates. Indeed, liberal counterparts to Republican governors such as Walker, New Jersey's Chris Christie, Indiana's Mike Pence, and Ohio's John Kasich--ideologically motivated leaders with national profiles--don't exist. The simple fact is that even if everything goes well for Democrats in 2016, even if they hold the presidency and pick up the Senate as well, their long-term prospects are dire. After eight years in the White House, the party has atrophied, and given the partisan and demographic trends that are driving American politics--in particular, the demographic divergence in midterm and presidential elections--it's not clear what Democrats can do to fix the problem. Here's where we are: Far more than its competitor, the Democratic Party is at a crossroads. At the moment, it's being held together by its president and his potential successor, Hillary Clinton. But this obscures intraparty conflict and the extent to which the party is in desperate need of rebuilding for the second and third decades of the 21st century. This, of course, is normal. After an eight-year term with the White House, an incumbent party is often exhausted. But with likely vacancies on an ideologically split Supreme Court--to say nothing of the programs of the Obama administration--the stakes for the next election are high. Winning the White House is absolutely vital for Democrats, and although Hillary Clinton is a great asset, she's--potentially--their only one. This article is excerpted and adapted from The Surge: 2014's Big GOP Win and What It Means for the Next Presidential Election, edited by Larry J. Sabato with Kyle Kondik and Geoffrey Skelley."	Why Hillary Clinton Is More Vital to the Democratic Party's Future Than Even Democrats Realize
20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/04/rand_paul_iowa_why_the_state_is_essential_to_the_kentucky_senator.html	"IOWA CITY, Iowa--Rand Paul kicked off his first public appearance in the Hawkeye State since launching his anti-establishment presidential campaign with a question that was meant as a rallying cry. ""Do we have any liberty lovers here?"" he asked a crowd composed mostly of University of Iowa students, who sported Rand stickers and responded with cheers and whistles. But if Paul's going to have any chance of contending for his party's nomination, he better hope their nonlibertarian-leaning parents feel the same way. The Iowa caucus will, of course, be the first major test for the entire GOP field--but the first-in-the-nation nominating contest is particularly important for Paul. The Kentucky senator's campaign is predicated on the idea that he'll be able to hold onto the libertarian-leaning bloc of voters who helped his father carve out a corner of the national stage in 2012, while at the same time layering upon that base enough converts from the more traditionally Republican masses to put him over the top. The Hawkeye State would appear to be particularly fertile ground for that strategy to take root. If it fails here, Paul will have a difficult time convincing anyone that it will work anywhere else. In 2012, Ron Paul had one of his best showings of his entire campaign in Iowa, and much of that political infrastructure remains in place today. The elder Paul won 21 percent of the GOP caucus vote, enough to earn the libertarian firebrand an unexpectedly close--if largely overshadowed--third-place finish behind Rick Santorum and eventual nominee Mitt Romney, both of whom bested the Texas congressman by only four points, or less than 4,000 votes apiece. It's conceivable, then, that Rand Paul will find himself among the caucus favorites come February 2016 simply by picking up where his father left off four years earlier. But the family legacy isn't without its disadvantages, and not only because Ron Paul supporters managed to burn a whole host of state GOP bridges over the past few years. Nominating contests--and early nominating contests in particular--are largely about how a candidate performs relative to expectations, and the expectations for Rand Paul will be high in Iowa, where the complicated and time-consuming caucus process lends particularly well to his brand of motivated supporters. Simply matching his father's strong performance won't be enough for a candidate who has promised to transform himself from a conservative gadfly into a legitimate contender. If Paul can't add a sizeable chunk of establishment or evangelical voters to his libertarian-leaning coalition in Iowa, there will be little reason to believe he'll be able to do so in other states where he won't have the luxury of a robust foundation on top of which he can build. Worse still, if he falls short of Ron Paul's mark, it will mean that not only was he unable to add to the coalition his father assembled, but that he wasn't even able to preserve it. By trying to be all things to all GOP voters, he'll have effectively become nothing to everyone. Already there are signs that could happen in Iowa. Paul's efforts to attract social conservatives and foreign policy establishment types have only just begun, and already there are grumblings among Ron Paul's true believers that the younger Paul is selling out. An internal poll conducted in February of the elder Paul's delegates to the 2012 Iowa GOP convention found that fewer than 70 percent of those delegates are leaning Rand Paul's way in 2016. ""He's moderating on most of [his father's positions], not taking a real clear stance on a number of them,"" Drew Ivers, the chairman of Ron Paul's 2012 Iowa campaign and one of a number of recent high-profile defections from Rand's camp, complained to Politico last month. ""The strategy of sending a blended message is one that has risk."" It's not all bad news for the Paul camp, however. In Iowa, he might not have to venture as far from his base as he may need to in other contests to be competitive. If everyone who is expected to seek the nomination does, the crowded field in Iowa could work to Paul's advantage. Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, and Marco Rubio will have to fight it out for the support of the establishment Republicans who backed Romney in 2012, while Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, and Santorum will need to compete for the evangelical votes that delivered the caucus to Santorum in 2012 and Huckabee in 2008. If everything were to break right for Paul, he wouldn't need to win a larger slice of the vote than his father to win the caucus. And if he pulls off a victory--something his father never managed to do on any primary or caucus night--it will be easy enough to overlook the raw numbers that delivered it. Still, even there Paul faces a potential no-win situation in the long term. A libertarian-heavy campaign in Iowa might be enough to deliver him a caucus victory, but it won't be enough to ultimately win the nomination--and by the time Iowans show up to caucus, there won't be much time left for Paul or any other candidate to rebrand for the contests that will follow. The distance between now and the caucuses is further than between the caucuses and the GOP nomination. Rand Paul, then, faces a choice: He can focus on winning the battle in Iowa and know he'll likely lose the nominating war. Or he can give up his best shot at an early nominating contest victory in hopes of future ones. We know Rand Paul's determined to do better than his father. The question will come down to just how much better he wants to do. Read more of Slate's coverage of Rand Paul."	If Rand Paul Can't Beat Ron Paul's Numbers in Iowa, He's Toast
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/04/rand_paul_youth_vote_the_gop_hopeful_says_he_s_the_best_candidate_to_win.html	"Rand Paul formally kicked off his presidential campaign on Tuesday in Louisville, Kentucky, where he warned parents that the American Dream was ""slipping away for our sons and daughters."" On Friday, the Republican senator will take the stage at the University of Iowa--his fourth stop on his five-state campaign rollout--to deliver that message directly to America's youth, a group that the 52-year-old has signaled he'll put front and center throughout his campaign. Paul has been laying the groundwork for such a youth-focused pitch since he burst onto the national stage in March 2013 with his drone-themed, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington-style filibuster on the floor of the U.S. senator. When the Wall Street Journal's editorial board blasted the 13-hour feat of endurance as an empty political stunt designed only to ""fire up impressionable libertarian kids in their college dorms""--GOP Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham piled on, too--Paul was quick to turn the establishment criticism into an insurgent rallying cry. ""We need a different kind of GOP, a party that speaks to the rising generation, who may have unique interests and concerns,"" the freshman senator wrote in an op-ed for the millennial-aimed website PolicyMic. In the two years since, Paul has tried harder than any other national Republican to make inroads with young voters. He's taken his libertarian-leaning show to college campuses, South by Southwest, and even Snapchat. He's made reforming the criminal justice system, legalizing medical marijuana, and reining in domestic spying--causes that have proven popular with younger Americans--key pillars of his campaign. Just as important as what he's been talking about on the stump has been what he's largely avoided: polarizing social issues, like marriage equality, that tend to send young voters running into the open arms of Democrats. The problem, though, is that there's little to suggest all that work is paying off for the jeans-and-blazer-wearing Paul to the degree you might expect. Strip away the media narrative that Paul's particular brand of self-described ""libertarian-ish"" politics will play particularly well with young Americans, and the available polling data suggest that Paul hasn't actually earned his reputation as the conservative who's best at luring that group into the GOP tent. In recent national surveys conducted by the Washington Post and CNN, Paul was beat by Jeb Bush among those possible GOP voters 45 and younger and 50 and younger, respectively. A trio of Marist polls in early-nominating states tells only a slightly more exciting story for the freshman senator. Among possible Republican voters under 45, Paul is currently running fourth in Iowa and second in South Carolina--with the lone bright spot coming in New Hampshire, where he currently leads among that demographic. There's significantly less polling data on younger subsets of the under 45s, but what is out there does little to make the case for the Man Who Would Be Homecoming King. Paul came in second to Bush in January in a Fusion poll of Americans between 18 and 34, and failed to outshine his fellow GOP hopefuls in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup with Hillary Clinton among that same demographic in a Quinnipiac University survey from last month. It's not that Paul isn't popular with a certain subset of young Republican diehards--his performance in the Conservative Political Action Conference straw poll is proof that he is--it's just that that there's little evidence that he will be the difference-maker he's selling himself as when it comes to broadening the GOP's ranks of college kids and young professionals. To be fair to Paul, his campaign is currently framed around his ability to attract younger voters, not a declaration that he's already accomplished that. But it's clearly not a good sign when a two-year head start on the college circuit doesn't actually put you out in front. More troubling still is the fact that his job will only get more difficult as the nominating battle ramps up. If Paul hopes to win over skeptical members of the Republican base--an absolute must if he plans to do better than his father did in any of his failed presidential runs--he'll need to spend more time calling for the repeal of Obamacare and the blocking of the president's immigration reform, and less time hyping the ideas that made him a hit on campuses in the days before he became an official candidate. The longer the campaign goes on, the more Paul will start to look like the rest of the GOP candidates on the debate stage. And even Paul's current tack of avoiding social issues appears unlikely to last through primary season. Already, the cracks are starting to show. Last month at a prayer breakfast in Washington, Paul made headlines when he declared gay marriage to be a ""moral crisis."" While that isn't technically at odds with his stance that the federal government shouldn't get to say who can and can't marry, it's hardly the stuff college kids and young professionals are eager to hear. Nonetheless, Paul's more likely to walk such claims forward than back on the primary trail. No one expects the Republican candidate to win the youth vote come 2016. In 2012, President Obama crushed Mitt Romney among voters in their teens and 20s by a whopping 60-to-36-percent margin, and it would be a shock if the Democratic nominee can't protect the bulk of that lead. Still, with millennials set to account for the lion's share of the U.S. electorate for the first time ever in 2016, it's painfully clear to the GOP that the party needs to find a way to compete for more of those votes. In the end, Paul may still turn out to be the man best suited to do just that, proving himself capable of selling a conservative version of Obama's hope and change to young voters in the process. But so far the current incarnation of the candidate hasn't proved he's likely to be able to pull off such a feat--and it's hard to imagine the next one will either."	Rand Paul Says He's the Best Candidate to Win Over Young Voters. There's No Evidence He's Right.
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/04/rand_paul_presidential_announcement_the_kentucky_senator_s_appeal_to_every.html	"For four years, Rand Paul has been running for president. And for those four years, he's tried to be a different kind of Republican. He went to Howard University to win over black Americans, to Silicon Valley to win the technology set, to Detroit to tout criminal-justice reform, and to other colleges across the country to win over young voters with a message of privacy and drug reform. At the same time, he's made a pitch to evangelicals, tried to appeal to conservative business interests, and continued to cultivate his base of right-wing libertarians. But, as everyone who runs for president eventually learns, the party doesn't want a different kind of anything. The party wants someone acceptable--someone who seems electable and who has the support of other factions and interests in the coalition. Paul's goal is to bring his brand of Republicanism to a broader group of Americans across the political spectrum, to show that there's something for everyone. The Republican Party's goal, by contrast, is to choose a nominee who best represents the party as a whole. Paul seems to know this, and on Tuesday--announcing his bid for the Republican presidential nomination--he tried to balance his goals with what the party wants. ""This message of liberty is for all Americans, Americans from all walks of life. The message of liberty, opportunity, and justice is for all Americans, whether you wear a suit, a uniform, or overalls, whether you're white or black, rich or poor,"" he said in his speech, before turning to language favored by more traditional Republicans. ""Self-esteem can't be given; it must be earned. Work is not punishment; work is the reward."" A few lines later, he seesawed back to his priorities, denouncing the so-called crony capitalism of Washington and the Obama administration--""Politically connected cronies get taxpayer dollars by the hundreds of millions and poor families across America continue to suffer""--and then sliding to a rhetorical place in which rank-and-file Republicans could feel comfortable. ""I want to see millions of Americans back at work. In my vision for America, we'll bring back manufacturing jobs that pay well. How? We'll dramatically lower the tax on American companies that wish to bring their profits home."" It's not too hard to balance a message of radical small government--Paul wants a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution--with traditional Republican concerns. More difficult is Paul's long-standing opposition to Republican and Democratic foreign policy, which he sees as too militant and interventionist. ""A more restrained foreign policy is the true conservative foreign policy,"" he said in 2011, marking a position at odds with most Republicans and making him anathema to conservatives with strong, aggressive views on national security. Paul seems to know he's alienated the foreign-policy establishment, and for the past year, he's tried to move closer to the pack, most prominently with a muddled call for action against ISIS. ""ISIS is now a threat. Let's get on with destroying them,"" he said on the Senate floor in 2014. ""But make no mistake--arming Islamic rebels in Syria will only make it harder to destroy ISIS."" Since then, Paul has continued to refine his message by slowly abandoning his prior commitments, or at least subordinating them to more bellicose rhetoric. Hence the part of his announcement speech in which he declares that ""the enemy"" to the United States is ""radical Islam"" and promises to ""do whatever it takes to defend America from these haters of mankind,"" following up with a hawkish jab at Obama's approach to diplomacy. ""I believe in applying Reagan's approach to foreign policy to the Iran issue. Successful negotiations with untrustworthy adversaries are only achieved from a position of strength. ... I will oppose any deal that does not end Iran's nuclear ambitions and have strong verification measures."" The whole speech was an  attempt to reconcile Paul's goals and previous positions with the demands of a nomination contest, in which he'll have to appeal to the full spectrum of Republican voters. It won't work. Paul came off muddled, with a mishmash of positions that couldn't congeal into a coherent vision; if this is how he'll approach the primary, he may earn a little ground everywhere, but he won't build a foundation (at least outside of his father's supporters). After all, every other faction of conservatism has a champion. If you want a permissive business environment and wide deregulation, you can choose Scott Walker. If you want electability and potentially broader appeal, you can choose Jeb Bush. If you want evangelical fervor, there's Ted Cruz, and if you want a hawkish foreign policy, there's Marco Rubio. Rand Paul's ""Have It Your Way"" approach seems destined for failure even before we consider the positions--specifically, his history on foreign policy--that make him radioactive to important parts of the Republican primary electorate. There's simply nothing that sets him apart from the crowd. But Paul can change course. To do that, however, he has to understand that his campaign is an incredible long shot. In all likelihood, he won't make it past the first round of primaries next winter. If that's true, then his goal shouldn't be to appeal to everyone but to make a specific pitch that can gain traction and move the party in his direction. He also needs to find a signature issue and hammer it hard. My (unsolicited) suggestion? Criminal-justice reform. At the state level, the Republican Party is moving away from its past punitiveness, but policy change hasn't quite reached the national party. It's the one place  where a presidential candidate could move the conversation forward, building a larger constituency for reform and forcing the issue onto the party agenda. No, that's not the same as winning a nomination or becoming president, but it's important. It matters. And Paul should give it a shot."	Rand Paul Thinks He Can Solve All of America's Problems. He Should Just Focus on This One.
23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/04/rand_paul_for_president_why_the_libertarian_candidate_doesn_t_stand_a_chance.html	"Rand Paul will not be the next president of the United States. If I'm proven wrong about this, I'm prepared to get a prominent tattoo of Rand Paul taking his place on Mount Rushmore. To understand Paul, you must appreciate that he's not just thinking about 2016 or 2020, or even about his own political future. He hopes to remake the Republican Party in his libertarian image. Though he might not succeed this time around, his devotees believe that he is in a much stronger position to do so than his cantankerous father, Ron Paul, and they're not crazy. Rand really is a more appealing messenger than Ron, and it's at least possible that a libertarian Republican can appeal to younger Americans who are beyond the reach of a more traditional GOP candidate. What libertarian Republicans have so far failed to reckon with, however, is that for every socially liberal voter willing to join the ""leave-us-alone coalition,"" there are at least one or two other swing voters who will run screaming in the opposite direction. Before we delve into what today's libertarian visionaries get wrong about the American electorate, it is important to give Rand Paul his due. Even as Rand tries to distance himself from Ron, both men are driven by the same fundamental convictions that led Ron to bolt from the GOP in 1987. Back then, Ron railed against Ronald Reagan for being a ""warmed-over Keynesian"" and a warmonger who was threatening America's civil liberties. Indeed, Ron went so far as to run for president as the Libertarian Party candidate in 1988, when he won 430,000 votes just as Reagan's even squishier vice president romped to a mammoth victory. Ron eventually made his way back into the Republican tent, though you get the distinct impression that he did so reluctantly. For one thing, Ron's party affiliation never prevented him from denouncing other Republicans for their supposedly socialistic and militaristic ways. Rand has clearly learned from his father's years in the wilderness. Instead of leading a futile crusade against the GOP mainstream, Rand has chosen to go with a softer touch. When Rand was first elected to the Senate in 2010, it was on the strength of the army of libertarian activists that had coalesced around his father's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. But from early on, Rand demonstrated that he was his own man. Most prosaically, Rand, like virtually all Republicans of his generation, speaks warmly of Reagan, his father's bete noire. He has been careful to present himself not just as a conservative Republican, but as a more authentically conservative Republican than his detractors within the party. For example, many on the right have accused Rand of being an isolationist, a charge that stings in large part because his father was a scathing critic of America's military entanglements around the world. Rather than concede the point, Rand insists that his cautious approach to foreign policy is rooted in Reagan's ""Peace through Strength,"" reminding his GOP critics that Reagan was far more reluctant to use force than, say, George W. Bush. He's even said that he supports military action against ISIS, provided that it's authorized by Congress and that there is a clear exit strategy. Though Rand hasn't completely neutralized the isolationism charge, and though we can expect his would-be opponents, led by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, to challenge him on his dovishness, he certainly doesn't sound like a peacenik. If anything, foreign policy should be the least of Rand's concerns. The deeper challenge he faces is that Republicans are not as libertarian as he and his followers seem to believe. Consider taxes, an issue that you'd think would unite the GOP. In March, the Pew Research Center found that 45 percent of Republicans believe many wealthy people don't pay their fair share of taxes. That's lower than the 63 percent of independents and the 72 percent of Democrats who expressed the same sentiment, to be sure, but it's much higher than you'd think if the GOP were a straightforwardly libertarian party. And just in case you think this is a fluke, a new Washington Post-ABC News survey finds that when Republicans were asked if they'd favor a candidate who signed an anti-tax pledge over one who did not, only 26 percent said they'd favor the pledge-signer while 69 percent said that they'd favor the non-pledge-signer. To be fair, libertarianism is about more than just cutting taxes. Some libertarians, like the billionaire political activist David Koch, believe that tax hikes on the rich should be part of a broader effort to reduce future deficits. At the very least, the fact that Republicans, and Americans more broadly, are so open to tax increases should be somewhat discouraging to a libertarian like Rand. If not tax cuts, what exactly is he offering anxious middle-income voters? How will Rand Paul help them climb the economic ladder? If your answer is that he wants to make it easier for you to open a falafel stand without a license, you haven't thought hard enough about the question. Principled libertarians might scoff at the idea that it's government's job to lend families a helping hand. Unfortunately for them, this idea is deeply ingrained in the minds of American voters, and it will take more than a stump speech or two to convince them otherwise. One of Rand's chief arguments for his electability is that a libertarian Republican who opposes mass surveillance and favors local control over education, health care, marriage, and marijuana can win California and other deep-blue states. This may well be true among tech-savvy libertarian entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, a group that Rand has assiduously courted. But will it work with ordinary working- and middle-class California voters who opposed Mitt Romney and George W. Bush? Can Rand win over the millions of Californians who depend on the earned-income tax credit, Medicaid, and food stamps by promising to leave them alone? How many Californians, and for that matter how many Americans, vote on issues like fighting Internet censorship, legalizing industrial hemp, and banning drone strikes on U.S. citizens? In case you can't tell, I'm skeptical. Like it or not, the same voters who will cheer Rand on for backing prison reform and a path to legal status for unauthorized immigrants will recoil from his calls for deep cuts to safety net programs. None of this is to suggest that Rand Paul doesn't have a valued place in the GOP. Libertarians are the party's conscience, as they push back against government overreach on every front. Yet the mood of the country is such that a libertarian Republican is unlikely to go very far in 2016. What the GOP needs is a candidate who speaks to the economic aspirations of middle-income voters, not a candidate driven first and foremost by libertarian zeal."	Republicans Aren't Nearly As Libertarian As Rand Paul Supporters Wish They Were 
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/04/social_security_expansion_how_democrats_turned_around_on_an_essential_liberal.html	"You probably missed it, but, late last month, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders helped push the Democratic Party a little to the left. During a last-minute budget session, the Massachusetts senator introduced an amendment to ""expand and protect Social Security"" by raising taxes to keep the program solvent and increasing benefits to better assist seniors. The resolution failed to pass the Republican-controlled Senate, but not before Warren won support from all but two of her Democratic colleagues. (The holdouts were Tom Carper of Delaware and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota.) Likewise, during the same session, Sanders introduced an amendment protecting all Americans from cuts to earned Social Security benefits. It also failed the GOP Senate, but--like Warren's amendment--it won support from virtually every Democrat in the chamber. Indeed, as a Monday story in the Wall Street Journal points out, Social Security expansion has entered the Democratic mainstream, touted by lawmakers and pushed by presidential candidates like Martin O'Malley, as well as congressional candidates like Rep. Donna Edwards, who is running for an open Senate seat in Maryland. Now, ""Democrats Support Social Security"" may sound like a nonstory, a political ""Dog Bites Man."" But it's not. Think back to the period stretching from just after the Democratic nadir of the 2010 midterm elections to just after the 2012 presidential election when, caught in Washington's hysteria over spending, Barack Obama and other Democrats tried hard to strike a bipartisan ""grand bargain"" on debt and deficits. In exchange for a modest tax hike of $100 billion over 10 years--targeted at the wealthiest Americans--Democrats were willing to cut spending on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. It was an outrageous deal. For almost nothing, Obama was giving away the store on core party priorities; for decades, Democrats defended retirement programs with near-religious zeal. Now, a Democratic president was clearing the field for an attack on two pillars of the welfare state. But blinded by ideology and their hatred of Obama, House Republicans couldn't see the great deal in front of them. They rejected it, leaving Obama to shrink from the grand bargain and gradually abandon the entire approach. Liberals didn't abandon Obama over his push for entitlement cuts. Instead, they recalibrated. Instead of a perpetual defense--in which they rallied to fight attacks on retirement programs--they would go on the offense, pushing the party to adopt a more expansive vision of Social Security and other entitlements. It helps that there's a real problem. Americans are woefully unready for retirement, with little savings and an individualized system of defined contributions and 401Ks that isn't durable in the face of sluggish growth and a weak economy. Social Security isn't perfect, but it's a strong foundation for a broader program of retirement security. It's why, in 2012, the AFL-CIO called for Democrats to expand the program. ""To compensate for the decline of traditional pensions and the loss of retirement savings,"" wrote the organization, ""Social Security retirement benefits must be increased across the board, which would be especially meaningful for low-income seniors."" The next year, the left-leaning New America Foundation released a broad plan for expanding Social Security by creating a new branch of the program--Part B--that would give a flat benefit to all retirees in addition to the existing Old Age and Survivors Insurance. (Disclosure: New America is a partner in Slate's Future Tense.) And while this pitch was meant to solve a problem, it was also meant to challenge the prevailing view at the time that the entitlement should be cut. ""At present the discussion is dominated by those who want to privatize or shrink Social Security and those on the defensive who propose merely incremental reforms to preserve it,"" wrote the authors. ""We seek not merely to move the ball, but also to move the goalpost in order to enlarge the boundaries of the national conversation about the future of retirement security in America."" Liberal activists pushed expansion through 2013 and 2014, with unions and liberal groups like Social Security Works and the Progressive Change Committee Campaign at the forefront. Eventually, this activity bubbled through to Democratic lawmakers. Facing a tough--and ultimately futile--re-election campaign, Alaska Sen. Mark Begich introduced his plan to protect Social Security by lifting the cap on income subject to the payroll tax, from its present level of $113,700. That same year, then Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin pushed a plan to boost benefits, and Warren joined the fight with a floor speech against a proposal to chain Social Security benefits to a different--and less generous--measure of inflation. The March amendments, in other words, were the culmination of a longer process sparked by liberal activists and Democratic insiders, and pushed along by friendly senators. Because of her high public profile, Warren will almost certainly get most of the credit for pushing the Democratic Party to adopt Social Security expansion as a priority. But it's more accurate to say that she--along with lawmakers like Joe Manchin of West Virginia--saw where the winds were blowing, and opened their sails accordingly. But the real test of Social Security's resurgence as a liberal cause is Hillary Clinton. When Social Security solvency meant benefit cuts, she was open to benefit cuts. Now it doesn't. But we don't know where Clinton will fall. We do know that she hasn't locked down the Democratic presidential nomination completely. There are still stakeholders to win and voters to persuade. If liberals make expansion a priority, will Clinton sign on? Or does she have enough party support to resist the call of Elizabeth Warren and keep her prior commitment to ""entitlement reform?"" There's no answer yet, but it will come. That, after all, is what primaries are for."	Social Security Is Having a Moment. Here's How Democrats Came Around on Trying to Expand It.
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/04/presidential_job_application_seven_questions_we_should_ask_anyone_who_wants.html	"Presidential announcement season is upon us. Sen. Ted Cruz has jumped in the pool. Sen. Rand Paul is expected to join him next week. Sen. Marco Rubio will do the same thing the following week. Hillary Clinton will take her step ""soon"" according to staffers-in-waiting who are eager to switch from their personal Gmail accounts to the official campaign one. Al Gore said that a presidential campaign is like a job interview. If that's true, then when these candidates announce, we should hand them a few preliminary questions at the start of the process. After all, that's even required of the average Starbucks employee. Presumably this job is harder. So here are a few basic inquiries. These are not gotcha questions. They're open-book questions. Candidates may refer to their notes, or their campaign biographies, as the case may be. Also, they can take their time. The first contest in Iowa isn't for another 10 months. 1. What's the biggest crisis you've faced in your professional life and how did you handle it? Everyone agrees there is no real experience that can prepare a person for the presidency. This is not a reason to allow candidates to duck questions about experience though. I'm sure there's nothing like the first time a quarterback plays in a Super Bowl, but that doesn't keep us from looking at his previous games to come to some conclusion about his ability to handle the big game. One thing we know is that presidents face few easy decisions. Also, crises often hit early, whether it's the Bay of Pigs or the downing of an EP-3 spy plane. Will a candidate know what it's like to be in a pinch? Will they know how to keep their head when everyone around them is losing theirs? This is the kind of question where a good answer can pretty much allow you to leave the remaining questions blank. For example, when Dwight Eisenhower was nominated he told the 1952 GOP convention: ""I know something of the solemn responsibility of leading a crusade. I have led one."" That's a pretty good resume line. This question refers to ""professional life,"" so it need not only apply to political office. (Ben Carson once led a 70-member surgical team for 22 hours to separate conjoined twins. That would be a good thing to talk about here.) 2. What's the biggest personal crisis you've faced and how did you handle it? We'll probably never get candidates to answer this question--though several Republicans came close in 2011 at an Iowa forum hosted by the Family Leader and Democrats came close at the Sojourners forum in 2007. Personal moments matter because they offer a window into a candidate's temperament, a quality anyone close to a president mentions as a key attribute for the job. It's the equanimity and sense of self that helps them deal with uncertainty, chaos, and overwhelming pressure. These qualities are tested in personal crucibles in a different way than they are in professional circumstances. George W. Bush's turn from alcohol to faith, for example, told us something about his mindset that was different than the challenges he'd faced in his professional life. 3. What's your greatest political triumph? This is an easy one for the politicians who are running because they've won elections. But they can't just point to their own victories and move on. This question seeks to get at why they won, what they saw in the electorate that others did not, and what they learned about people along the way. Being president requires understanding the political landscape. A candidate's answer to this question will give us some understanding about how he or she will read the currents when they take office. 4. What's your greatest governing triumph? Another way to ask this question: What bill did you pass or program did you enact that you are most proud of and why? This is a simple enough question (for everyone except Sen. Ted Cruz) and tells us something about whether the candidates can actually work within the political system they're hoping to lead. 5. What experience have you had that will serve you well as president? Not every candidate will have a governing triumph they can talk about. But surely they've done something with their lives they can boast about. Cruz, for example, said his successful career as Texas' solicitor general demonstrated his capacity to be president. But the point of this question is not just to dig up their shining moments--which the candidates freely tell anyone who gets in their path--but to hear how a candidate explains how those skills apply to the office they hope to hold. House Speaker John Boehner, for example, said that his life working in a bar was great training for dealing with his House Republicans. This not only tells us something about Boehner's skill set, but also tells us how he sees his job. 6. What historical presidential moment tells us the most about your vision of the office? This is something like asking a Home Depot employee about their greatest home improvement project. Have these candidates studied the job they hope to hold? For a president, history is like a user manual for a job no one can be fully prepared for. That not only tells us if a candidate is thinking about the actual business of being president (Newt Gingrich was particularly good at this), but whether they have a fantastical vision of the office or a more realistic one. Gov. Scott Walker, for example, has said that Reagan's move against the air traffic control workers sent a message to Communist leaders in Russia. Russian experts disagree. Debating just that simple question would tell us a lot about the Wisconsin governor. 7. Tell us a joke. Former Defense Secretary Bob Gates said temperament and a sense of humor are the two key presidential attributes. ""I think a sense of humor and a sense of the absurd reflects a balance and a perspective on the world that is very healthy,"" said Gates when I asked him about presidential attributes last year. ""Of all the presidents that I worked for, there are only two who had no discernible sense of humor: Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. I rest my case."" No candidate can answer all of these questions completely or perfectly, but at least we can measure how far short they fall from the ideal. Then from there we can judge whether they have the qualities to be the 45th president. Or, the candidates can offer a lively argument for why these questions don't make sense and other questions should be asked. As voters attending town hall meetings these questions are there for you to ask, too. Any time you think the media has gotten too wrapped up in the horse race or the frivolous kerfuffle of the day you can ask one of these Dudley-Do-Right questions. On many job applications there is also a box in which applicants can tell their prospective employer any other significant facts they think will help them get the job. It's an important addendum meant to capture characteristics that might be missed by a necessarily limited form. We don't have that space here because that's essentially what the rest of the campaign is for."	Seven Questions We Should Ask Anyone Who Wants to be President

The question sounds simple. But it isn't. Consider two scenarios. In the first, you're a restaurant manager. Two women come in holding hands and kissing. They ask to be seated. You tell them, as politely as possible, that you don't serve people who engage in homosexual behavior. In the second scenario, you're still the restaurant manager. But this time, the couple doesn't ask to be seated. Instead, they tell you they're going to be married in a few months. They'd like you to cater the wedding. You reply, as politely as possible, that you only cater ""traditional"" weddings. Are the two scenarios equivalent? Most of my friends think they are. I don't. But at the moment, my opinion doesn't matter. The person whose opinion matters is Mike Pence, the Republican governor of Indiana. Pence recently signed a religious freedom law that has triggered a national firestorm. His supporters say the law protects their right to withhold services for same-sex weddings. His opponents say the law protects the right to discriminate against gay people in general. Pence seems incapable of articulating the difference. For the past three days, Pence has struggled to answer both versions of the question. On Sunday, he gave a disastrous interview to George Stephanopoulos on ABC's This Week. Pence was pilloried, rightly, for refusing to answer yes-or-no questions. But nobody seems to have noticed how the questions morphed during the interview. Here they are, verbatim:"	The Slow Evolution of Mike Pence
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/pras_michel_funded_super_pac_black_men_vote_limited_liability_companies.html	"It was less than a month before the 2012 election when a spokesman for Black Men Vote, a political group backed by hip-hop musicians including Common and Pras Michel, publicly announced: ""I want a $500,000 donor."" Three days later, his wish was all but granted. That's when a cool $400,000 landed in the bank account of Black Men Vote, a super PAC whose goal was mobilizing young black men to support President Barack Obama's re-election. The source of the money? An obscure limited liability company identified as SPM Holdings LLC with an address in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. By Election Day, SPM Holdings would double down and make an additional six-figure contribution, bringing its total financial support of Black Men Vote to $875,000. It was one of the largest donations to a super PAC ever by a limited liability company, according to a Center for Public Integrity review of federal campaign finance records. Moreover, the LLC money represented two-thirds of the $1.3 million Black Men Vote raised in 2012. That's a larger portion of money than any other top-tier super PAC has received from limited liability companies--business entities that can be used to shield the identities of people making large political contributions. Federal records would eventually show that Pras, a Grammy-winning rapper and founding member of the Fugees, provided $250,000 in seed money for the super PAC's efforts and another $100,000 before Election Day. ""The best way we can make a change is empowering one another,"" Pras told the Center for Public Integrity in a recent interview. ""I put my money where my mouth was."" But the donor (or donors) behind SPM Holdings would remain--until now--a mystery. The allure of LLCs Super PACs, which were created in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens United decision and a related federal court case in 2010, are supposed to be transparent political committees, publicly disclosing who funds them. However, limited liability companies such as SPM Holdings can serve as vehicles for megadonors to contribute to the groups--many of which are aligned with specific political candidates--while hiding their identities from voters. ""This is an avenue that will appeal to people who want to spend money politically and not necessarily be disclosed,"" said Elizabeth Kingsley, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney who specializes in campaign finance law. That's because some states, such as Delaware and Wyoming, don't require LLCs to identify the living, breathing people who own or control them. Instead, they need to provide only the name of a ""registered agent,"" which is often a company that exists only to serve as the registered agents for LLCs. ""You don't even have to have a human being as a member of certain LLCs,"" said Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, a law professor at Stetson University College of Law. ""It can get quite byzantine very quickly."" The allure of using LLCs to influence politics could become even stronger if the Internal Revenue Service institutes proposed new rules that would require ""social welfare"" nonprofits organized under Section 501(c)(4) of the U.S. tax code to be less politically active. Today, hundreds of millions of dollars in largely untraceable ""dark money"" flow through such groups for political expenditures. At least $33 million--and counting LLCs are already playing politics. Collectively, they've pumped at least $33 million into super PACs since 2010, according to a Center for Public Integrity review of federal campaign finance data. That's only about 2 percent of all of the money that super PACs have raised, but it's been concentrated in contributions to several of the nation's most powerful super PACs. The amount of money may also be higher because super PACs do not always identify an LLC donor as a limited liability company in campaign finance filings. Democratic-aligned Senate Majority PAC, for example, has received more than $3.7 million from LLCs since 2010, including $1.65 million last October from the Council for American Job Growth LLC, an offshoot of a pro-immigration reform group founded by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. In a rare move, the Council for American Job Growth itself spent $720,000 last fall on ads boosting Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, rather than donating it to an established political group. It's unclear who funds the Council for American Job Growth. Meanwhile, two massive Republican super PACs--Restore Our Future and American Crossroads--have amassed more money from LLCs than any others, the Center for Public Integrity's analysis indicates. In most cases the people behind the contributions have been identified, but not always. Restore Our Future, the main super PAC that supported Republican 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, raised more than $10 million from LLCs--more than any other super PAC. Energy companies Oxbow Carbon LLC and Huron Carbon LLC--two LLCs connected to billionaire William Koch, the lesser-known brother of conservative bankrollers Charles and David Koch--ranked among Restore Our Future's largest donors, giving $2.75 million and $1 million, respectively. Restore Our Future also received a $1 million contribution from a shadowy, Delaware-based outfit called W Spann LLC. That company's gift made headlines after NBC News detailed how this LLC formed, made the seven-figure contribution, and dissolved within a matter of months. Within days of the story, campaign watchdogs filed complaints with the Federal Election Commission and Department of Justice accusing W Spann LLC of simply being a conduit for someone to make a political contribution--and for also failing to register as a political action committee. Ed Conard, a former official at private equity firm Bain Capital who had close ties to Romney, ultimately came forward as the mystery man behind W Spann LLC. Conard insisted he acted legally. But he also asked Restore Our Future to amend its campaign finance report to name him, not his company, as the donor. To this day, Paul S. Ryan, an attorney at the Campaign Legal Center--one of the watchdog groups that filed complaints against W Spann LLC--argues that Conard broke the law by using an LLC to ""hide"" his identity. Limited liability companies, Ryan said, cannot be used to ""simply launder funds."" Delaware, where paper trails dead-end Like W Spann LLC, SPM Holdings LLC--the entity that helped bankroll Black Men Vote--is also difficult to unpack. First, state business registration records don't show any company named ""SPM Holdings LLC"" in Florida, where federal election records say it's located. Florida real estate records, however, do show a company named ""SPM 2012 Holdings LLC"" at the same Florida address that the Black Men Vote super PAC listed for SPM Holdings LLC in its campaign finance filing. SPM 2012 Holdings LLC is likewise not registered in Florida. Instead, it's officially registered in Delaware, where records list only a registered agent: Dover, Delaware-based Registered Agent Solutions Inc., a for-profit company that boasts of being ""an innovative leader in the registered agent and transactional service industry."" An employee of Registered Agent Solutions Inc. said it was the company's policy not to give out client information. ""There is no public information that I can provide,"" she added. Back in Florida, a business and financial consulting firm called Cruden Bay Partners LLC also shares the same address as SPM 2012 Holdings LLC. But even some people there said they were unfamiliar with it. One Cruden Bay employee told the Center for Public Integrity ""there's no SPM here,"" and said, ""you might have the wrong number,"" before hanging up the telephone. Reached via email, Lawrence Rovin, a lawyer who owns Cruden Bay Partners, wrote: ""I am not at liberty to provide you with any information regarding SPM 2012 Holdings, LLC."" Who is SPM Holdings? Black Men Vote ultimately spent nearly $850,000 during the fall of 2012 on radio ads in Virginia and Ohio that supported the president's re-election. Obama handily carried black voters in both battleground states. Exit polls showed that black voters made up a larger share of the vote in the Buckeye State than they had four years earlier, increasing from 11 percent of all voters in 2008 to 15 percent in 2012. In Virginia, 1 out of every 5 voters during both elections was black. It's hard to definitively say how large a role Black Men Vote played in either state, but officials with the super PAC say they were pleased with their efforts. ""We know that we were a part of the equation,"" said Jeff Johnson, a former BET host and the spokesman for Black Men Vote who made the $500,000 fundraising appeal two years ago. Pras, too, said he believes the group was successful. And as it turns out, he actually gave more money than the federal filings themselves indicated. The former Fugees star confirmed that SPM Holdings LLC--which is officially called SPM 2012 Holdings LLC--was his, adding that it was ""just a holding company to do my everyday business through."" This acknowledgment means that Pras provided $1.2 million in total to Black Men Vote, or more than 90 percent of its receipts. William Kirk, the founder and treasurer of Black Men Vote, said he was grateful for the resources provided by Pras and the super PAC's other supporters. ""Hopefully people will see Black Men Vote as an example,"" he said of the group, which effectively ceased operations after the 2012 election. Kirk was talking about using a super PAC to reach a specific demographic, such as the 18-to-34-year-olds targeted by Black Men Vote. But others could draw a different lesson from the group as well: It's a road map for how to opaquely fund a super PAC. No consensus for new rules While the major LLC donor behind Black Men Vote has now--more than two years after the 2012 election--voluntarily revealed his identity, federal law does not require this disclosure. And ideological divisions on the Federal Election Commission, the nation's top campaign regulator, may sink any proposal that would try to do so. Even as the Citizens United ruling has reshaped the nation's political landscape, new rules for LLCs haven't been discussed. Individuals have long been allowed to use LLCs to make donations to federal candidates--but contribution records must show both the name of the LLC and the name of the person, or people, responsible for the money. That's to ensure that individuals don't exceed campaign contribution limits and that candidates don't receive corporate money. Neither of those regulatory rationales apply to the world of super PACs, as these political committees may accept contributions of unlimited size, including money from corporations. But activists in some states, such as New York, are currently pushing to change how contributions from LLCs to state politicians are treated. The FEC's three Republican commissioners, who are often at odds with their three Democratic-leaning counterparts, declined to comment for this story. David Mason, a former Republican FEC chairman, said it's ""pointless"" to create additional reporting requirements for LLCs that give money to super PACs, because ""anybody who didn't want that information disclosed would simply do the exact same activity through a corporation."" But at least two of the commission's Democratic members don't see it that way. ""It is another situation where we have a failure to require important disclosure that the public's entitled to have,"" said Ann Ravel, the Democrat who currently serves as the commission's chairwoman. Her sentiments were echoed by fellow Democratic FEC Commissioner Ellen Weintraub, who stressed that super PACs are supposed to be transparent. ""If you don't know who's behind it,"" Weintraub said, ""then you don't know what you don't know. Could be a foreign citizen. Could be a foreign government. Could be anybody.""

28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/03/ted_cruz_says_he_is_no_community_organizer_what_executive_skills_does_he.html	"Ted Cruz defended his lack of executive experience this weekend saying that he is not a ""community organizer."" The Texas senator explained that unlike Barack Obama, who also ran for president after one term in the Senate, he had accomplished more before becoming a legislator. Cruz pointed to his period as solicitor general of Texas--an answer that was itself a display of the debating talents his supporters say qualify him to be president. Cruz wasn't answering the question as much as redefining the criteria. A lack of executive experience cannot be overcome by simply not having the attributes of the last president who also lacked it. On the strict comparison, Cruz has more leadership experience than Obama had at the beginning of his presidential campaign. Over five and a half years as solicitor general, Cruz led a large agency with hundreds of lawyers. Obama never ran an equally complex organization. But that's not the operative issue when executive experience is the question. The practical question is whether he has the kind of skills the Republican governors he's competing against use every day and which most closely approximate the ones a president needs. The reason this matters is that previous competency gives us some indication about whether a politician can back up the promises he makes with results. That was the critique George W. Bush leveled against John McCain in the 2000 race. The Arizona senator called himself a ""reformer"" and Bush retorted that as Texas governor he was a ""reformer with results."" The distinction matters particularly when you promise an agenda as sweeping as Cruz does. The skills governors need include the ability to read the political landscape, pick priorities, build consensus among friends and foes, and convey their will to others. Cruz has no problem with setting priorities. He knows what he wants to do. What he hasn't demonstrated is any significant achievement as a political leader that compares with his opponents. John Podhoretz put it bluntly in the New York Post:  ""Ted Cruz's challenge: The other guys have done things."" A key requirement for a president is building relationships and mobilizing the bureaucracy. In these two areas Cruz has shown the opposite of proficiency. His Senate colleagues would agree that he's no community organizer. He is known more for the disorder he creates in his community. In fact, that's what he's running on: his stalwart opposition to the temporizing and capitulating GOP lawmakers in Washington. In the Senate, he has created more enemies than friends. This thrills his supporters, but it is not a recipe for governing. Cruz is good at winning a debate, but those talents haven't translated to winning over the minds of his colleagues who didn't already agree with him before he started. Their chief complaint is that while he may have focus, he is incapable of striving for anything besides symbolic goals. Governors can't afford to do that kind of thing. In the same way that a governorship or presidency isn't the same as a boardroom, it's also not the same as a courtroom. Never mind, say Cruz's supporters: He'll have the support of the grassroots who will put pressure on lawmakers to do the right thing. Cruz has a strong relationship with the party's base and he used it effectively to win his Senate seat. He overcame the establishment candidate in Texas with aplomb. His supporters will tell near-magical stories about his ability to raise the fortunes of politicians of whom he gives his support. But Obama also argued that voters could learn something about his executive talents from his electoral successes, so this would be a strange argument for Cruz to champion. Also as Obama proved once in office, there are limits to the power of stirring the grassroots to achieve executive rather than political goals. Plus, the idea that a candidate skilled at focusing grassroots passion could change the entire shape of government is an argument for community organizing. Cruz may be good at it, but he says he's not."	Can Ted Cruz Play Well With Others?

This season's host is Adam Davidson, the co-founder and host of NPR's Planet Money podcast. What follows is the transcript for Episode 3, which features Tony Banbury, the United Nations' assistant secretary-general for field support. To learn more about Working, click here. In addition to the transcripts, we've added some other Slate Plus perks for Season 2 of Working. The members-only version of each podcast will feature a short Slate Plus extra, and we're also allowing members early access to the podcast--look for it to publish on Sundays. The nonmember version will publish on Mondays. You may note some differences between this transcript and the podcast. Additional edits were made to the podcast after we completed this transcript. Adam Davidson: What is your name and what do you do for a living? Tony Banbury: My name is Tony Banbury, and I work at the United Nations; my job title is assistant secretary-general for field support. Basically, what that is, is making sure that U.N. peacekeeping missions and political missions, in places like South Sudan, or Iraq, or Afghanistan, or Mali, that they have all the stuff they need to do their jobs. They have the people, they have the planes, they have the bases, they have the food for the soldiers, they have the communications technology, all the stuff that they need to get their job done. Davidson: And we are right now in New York City. We're high up in the U.N. Tower looking over the East River. It's an amazing view. But you're--so, you're based here but your work obviously has--it spans the globe. How many missions are there out in the world? How many people are involved in--that you oversee? Banbury: Yes, I work here in New York at the U.N. headquarters, which recently got renovated over a couple-year period, and so we have a relatively nice, new building, certainly with a beautiful view from the 34th floor. But the work that really matters is the work that is done in the field to support 30 missions. We have 16 peacekeeping missions and 14 political missions. Some of those political missions are very small. They're small offices of special envoys of the secretary-general, less than a hundred people. Some of the peacekeeping missions are quite large--10,000 or more troops, a few thousand police, a few thousand civilians, a budget of a billion dollars or more. So, the missions go the full range from quite small, like boutique political missions with a very narrow mandate, to very large peacekeeping missions with lots of airplanes, helicopters, ships, a ton of soldiers, bases, camps, and logistics requirements. And we basically need to find a way to do whatever it takes to support those missions, give them the tools they need to do their job. Davidson: You mean, literally, like food and pens and bullets and electricity? I mean-- Banbury: Literally, all of that. And a lot of these missions are deployed in places like the deserts of Northern Mali or the deserts of Darfur, where there is very weak infrastructure. So, if we need to send a battalion of soldiers--a battalion is about a thousand--to say, an area of Darfur in Sudan where there are risks to civilians, there's nothing there. There's no infrastructure. There's just desert. So, we need to build a base, start with a fence and level the ground, and then construct the buildings and bring in a power system, generators. We need to put in supply lines for fuel. We need to put in the information communications technology infrastructure so they can communicate with the headquarters and the rest of the world. Sewage and waste disposal. Make sure our--the garbage is disposed properly and not in a way that threatens the environment of the local population. So, it's really complex to do that kind of stuff out in the middle of nowhere, where the supply lines are maybe 1,000 or 1,500 kilometers--or miles, over 1,000 miles--from the say, closest port. Davidson:    So, what are you doing here? Are you finding ships and buying stuff? Or does the U.N. own all the ships it needs, own all the material it needs? How do you do that? How do you staff and supply a mission? Banbury: The--well, there are two ways to answer that question. We make sure that missions either are equipped themselves to say, purchase food locally to give to the soldiers who need to eat--and we put in place contracts and they get it locally--sometimes we do it ourselves. Like, aviation, we do all aviation contracting here. We have the second largest air fleet in Africa. We have hundreds of planes and helicopters serving our missions. All that is done back in-- Davidson: And you own those, or you-- Banbury: We charter all the aircraft. Sometimes it's a long-term charter, a contract for a year or so. Helicopters, cargo planes, passenger planes, what we call ""executive jets"" for our very senior officials who are moving around trying to conduct peace negotiations, or troop transport planes. We have a big variety of needs. And so our air fleet ranges from very small aircraft to quite big ones and a whole bunch of different kinds of helicopters. But we don't own them, and so we enter into a service contract with a provider, and they provide not only the aircraft but the maintenance, the crew, the insurance. They kind of do it all. It's a turnkey contact. Davidson: Wow. And then the stuff--I guess now is the time to disclose that I know you pretty well. So, in the interests of full disclosure, I should say that I know a lot more about you than I'm letting on, because you are my brother-in-law. I'm married to your sister. We know each other well, and I've even been in the field with you. We spent a fair bit of time together in Haiti. I was reporting and you were running the mission there, which we'll get to. And so, I want to make that clear, but also when I thought about people I know with interesting jobs you were the first guy I thought of. You have, I think, the most interesting job of anyone I know. But in a more mundane way, so, on the one hand you have this job that extends out to the most remote and war-torn parts of the world, but we're in a fairly, like, a nice standard office. You could use this office to be like, an insurance sales office or something like that. So, just walk me through what happens here. What are your days like? Banbury: There are four basic things that I do. One is focus on big, strategic issues that cut across our entire enterprise. They're not related just to our peacekeeping mission in Mali or the Central African Republic. It's how to put in place better strategies, structures, systems, and contracts so we can do a better job delivering the services we need to missions at a lower cost. That's one thing. Davidson: And when you say that's one thing, is that meetings, is that phone calls, is that-- Banbury: Well, it's a lot of things, and I've been doing this for years, and it involves so many different elements. For instance, we are putting in place a--we have something called a global fields import strategy, which is meant to look at our missions more as a global enterprise. The total value of peace operations for the U.N. is about $9.3 billion, which by the way is over four times the budget of the U.N. headquarters budget. So, we're much bigger in the field than we are here at headquarters. Davidson: You mean the entire U.N. headquarters budget, not just your part of it? The whole-- Banbury: The entire U.N. headquarters budget, this big, massive, 38-story building that has all the different elements of the--what's called the U.N. Secretariat, U.N. headquarters, its entire budget here. I can go into more detail if you want and maybe later, but just to kind of break out the four main kinds of activities, it's those sort of strategic issues that cut across the $9.3 billion enterprise. The second type of thing I do is worry about and respond to and deal with crises or challenges in individual missions. We have to build a lot of new camps now in the Central African Republic. The peacekeeping mission there is about seven months old. We're deploying a lot more troops and we have to build camps for them. That's really hard to do in the country of the Central African Republic because there's not a developed commercial sector. The construction sector hardly exists, at least for our needs. There is insecurity and there's very poor infrastructure and transportation. The port of Douala in Cameroon, where we have to ship stuff through, is totally congested. The local officials there are looking to get a lot of money out of us for moving our stuff through. So, it's solving problems of an operational nature like that for specific missions. Davidson: OK, so that's--so, No. 1 is big systemwide stuff. No. 2 is specific missions calling in and saying, ""Hey, we need help with this and we need help with that."" So, what's No. 3? Banbury: No. 3 is, here at U.N. headquarters there are all kinds of bureaucratic processes and meetings and just stuff that goes on in a very large organization. Davidson: I can tell from your body language and voice, that's your favorite part! You love the bureaucratic processes. Banbury: Yeah. And see, the Department of Field Support, we're very focused in providing field support. That's what we're about, we're a service provider to field missions. Here at headquarters, a lot of these processes aren't related to that, aren't related to what we need for DFS--the Department of Field Support--are much more related to the needs of a large bureaucracy in New York. And those processes can take up a lot of time and a lot of effort, but the payoff in terms of providing a better level of support for missions can be kind of low. And so I would rather spend my time focusing directly on those first two issues, but very often we have to be--as good team players and organizational citizen colleagues, we have to participate in those processes. Davidson: OK, and what's No. 4? Banbury: Four is dealing with just one problem after another that comes up. You know, one person after another comes into the door, you know, request-- ""Tony, I need help with this, I need help with that. Can you solve this?"" A personnel matter or a financial matter or some difficult situation, and just the--not the big mission crises, ""Oh, we have to evacuate people out of Libya."" But the little things that just pile up and pile up day after day, they just come in in large numbers and land on my desk. Davidson: You mean just being the boss of a multithousand person organization, there's just--people don't like their boss, people--whatever it is? Banbury: Right, right. Being the boss of a large organization and also I think someone who tries to help, tries to solve problems. That's part of my role or how I see myself as a problem-solver. The risk I think in any organization, if you're a problem-solver people come to you with problems to be solved. If you just create problems or are no good at it, they won't come to you. And there are lots of people like this in the US, hardworking people who try and get the job done and solve problems--I'm not saying I'm only one. But I know I just get a lot of problems that don't really belong to me that end up on my desk. Davidson: And then there's this other dimension to your job, which is dealing with the secretary-general, dealing with ambassadors, just sort of--you don't have the authority to say, ""Hey, I think we should establish a mission in,"" you know, ""Sierra Leone, and I'm going to just go ahead and establish a mission,"" right? Can you walk through how that works and how you fit into that process? Banbury: Even the secretary-general can't establish a new peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone. That's a decision of the Security Council. The Security Council will ask the secretary-general for his views on a crisis. They'll say, ""Secretary-general, please give us recommendations on establishing a peacekeeping mission,"" say, ""in the Central African Republic."" And then people like me and colleagues of mine, we will work to come up with a mission concept for a new mission in the Central African Republic. I should also be clear, though, that I'm the deputy of the Department of Field Support. I have a boss, the undersecretary-general of field support. I'm the assistant secretary-general of field support. The way we basically divide our roles and responsibilities is, he tends to focus more on the negotiations with the member states, a lot of the kind of policy committees and agenda setting, and I tend to focus more on operations and the field missions, which suits me very fine because that's what I like. But we're quite interchangeable, and I'll often end up briefing ambassadors and dealing with policy issues, and he will often end up getting involved in an operational issue related to a field mission. We work very well together in that respect. Davidson: So, one thing that--and I want to get to crises in a sec--but one thing I've noticed about you, and that other people have told me about you, which I'm going to say is not true when it comes to your immediate family, your kids, but does seem to be largely true at the U.N.--that you seem to maintain this equanimity. You're not prone to anger or to like, ""Goddamn, why are they--they're stretching me to thin!"" Or something. How do you deal with that every day? Banbury: I was just explaining to a new colleague who has come in to the U.N. at a very senior level from outside just the other day, that there tend to be a few different kinds of people at the U.N. There are a lot of people who come into the U.N. full of ideals and they want to change the world and they want to contribute, and they come in, and in a short period of time, within a year or two, they just think, ""Oh my God, this place is such a mess! The bureaucracy is terrible; it's dysfunctional; people are disconnected from what matters in the world."" And they're so idealistic and are not--do not have sufficient pragmatism--that they can't function in this environment. They just get frustrated so much and they're railing against the system, and they end up leaving. Then there's a group who come in and maybe initially have a lot of ideals and want to change the world, and then the bureaucracy just brings them down and they realize, oh, even if they don't work hard they will get paid the same amount, and it's not worth fighting and struggling so much to get things done. And they become part of the furniture and part of the problem. The people who really do well in the U.N. are those who maintain their ideals and their commitment to make the world a better place, and who believe in the organization's great value--the U.N.'s great value--but are pragmatic enough to figure out how to make it work, and understand that there are still going to be problems out there. The U.N.'s full of faults, but for all its faults it represents a unique tool for the world, and a great, great thing for the world to have at its disposal to help deal with problems around the world. And so, I hope I fall into that category, where I maintain my ideals about the United Nations and my great hopes for its ability to serve humanity, but am pragmatic enough to say, ""OK, let's figure out how to make it work and make it do its best,"" taking into account all of its flaws. Davidson: And we'll get to the big crises, but you travel--like, how often--like, just in regular DFS job, how much of the year are you traveling? I mean, it does seem to me that you travel a lot. Banbury: Yeah, I travel a lot. It's up and down, and so I might not travel at all for four or six weeks, and then I'll travel for three out of four weeks. So, I've been here for the past month or so, and I'm about to go away for 10 days and come back for a little bit, go away some more. So, it varies. And there are basically two kinds of travel. One kind of travel is to places like the deserts of Northern Mali, which I actually find the most interesting. It's really good. But other kinds are like, to fancy meetings somewhere, and so I'm going to be--in the next few weeks I'll be in Oxford. I'm going to be in Turin, and I'm going to Montreux, for very high level meetings that I've been invited to, including with the secretary-general and the top officials of the organization in Montreux. We meet once a year. The secretary-general convenes all the heads of peacekeeping missions and political missions from around the world. A very interesting meeting, a very engaged discussion, but of course very different than say, a field visit to Darfur. Davidson: And I've seen you travel in the field. Like, you usually have several bodyguards. It's kind of a big deal. Like, you're a target in these war--in these troubled areas. Banbury: It varies. I mean, certainly in Turin I'm not going to have a bodyguard. But if I go to Northern Mali or someplace like that, yeah, the security folks do an assessment and usually they'll throw a few bodyguards on me. Davidson: What are the big crises that you were--what's the word, seconded--to run the operations of? Banbury: I've been in this job for the past five years, a little more than five years. Before that I was the Asia regional director for the U.N. World Food program, and there, yes, I was very involved in the tsunami response and very involved in the response to Cyclone Nargis, which never got nearly the attention the tsunami did but basically the same number of people were killed, over 200,000 people killed from this cyclone in Burma. And that was a huge and challenging response. Here in this job, in the last five years, there have been four times where the secretary general has, yes, pulled me out of the job and said, please go do X. The first time was immediately after the earthquake in Haiti--absolutely devastating, more than 200,000 people killed. Also, the largest single loss of life for the United Nations in any single incident, 102 U.N. personnel killed, our headquarters destroyed. Friends of mine killed. And I went down there just a couple of days after the earthquake as deputy head of the peacekeeping mission, but basically in charge of the operational response and redirecting the mission to the needs of responding to the crisis that confronted us. Davidson: And in Haiti--because I spent a lot of time down there and a lot of time with you--but U.N. peacekeeping in Haiti is probably unlike the U.N. anywhere else in the world. I mean, it's a huge, huge force in the country. It probably had more capabilities than the government did. So, it was--your job was enormous. I mean, I watched you do it. It was an incredibly difficult and challenging job. Banbury: It was the most difficult and challenging job I had ever experienced, at least up until that time. The capital of the country had been absolutely devastated. Port-au-Prince, one of the many tragic aspects of that earthquake, was it struck right at the capitol, a dagger in the heart of the country. It destroyed the city. It happened in the late afternoon when a lot of government employees had gone home, but the hardworking dedicated ones were still at their desks and a lot of them were killed. And the U.N. did have a large peacekeeping force--just by coincidence, peacekeepers aren't normally those that get sent to respond to a natural disaster. But because we were there, of course we did. And essentially what we decided as soon as we got there was, we need to totally redirect all aspects and capabilities of the mission to the earthquake response, basically saving lives--so, supporting all humanitarian activities, etc.--and also to rebuilding the capability of the mission and taking care of the mission staff who had been there and who were so traumatized. A hundred of their colleagues, all of a sudden dead. Many lost very close friends that they had worked with a long time. Some lost spouses, children, just terrible tragic stories. And so we had to take care of our own people while we brought in a lot of new colleagues to really run the response. Davidson: While you're hundreds of people with one toilet, in really tough conditions--although everyone in the country was in tough conditions--but it was tough. Banbury: Those were probably the most difficult working/living conditions I'd ever experienced. Our U.N. Headquarters was destroyed. The buildings that were still standing in Port-au-Prince were--it wasn't clear which ones were stable and which weren't. So, our security people said that no one can stay in them, and so we were all basically camping down at the airport in our logistics base. I went down with a team and we all lived in the office. There was one large room with about 14--12 or 14--people working there, and the men slept in one room and then there was a side room that the women slept [in], on the floor, on cots, or whatever. Outside that building there were hundreds and hundreds of people, NGOs and all kinds of folks living in tents. And yeah, we all shared one lousy, stinking bathroom with one shower. It was really terrible and awful, and the lack of food--the food was terrible--it was a pretty horrible experience. But 102 U.N. people had just lost their lives and over 20,000 Haitians had. The country desperately needed us. We were working insane hours and we had to get the job done. And I think the U.N. mission played a very instrumental role in that critical period, in helping to get the country back on its feet. Davidson: All right, and now let's talk about your last job, which probably was your most important job I would think. Talk about your most recent non-DFS job. Banbury: Back in September--now, Americans will be much more familiar with this than with the Central African Republic--the Ebola crisis had spent out of control. Horrible images on TV screens of people dying in the streets of Monrovia. Projections that a million or more people were going to contract the disease by January. The numbers of cases increasing exponentially, and doubling every three weeks or so, at the peak in September. And clearly the crisis was getting much worse. Whatever was being done by various actors--U.N. agencies, NGOs, governments--it wasn't solving the problem. The crisis was rapidly and dramatically deteriorating. So, again, the secretary-general removed my from my DFS job and appointed me as his Ebola crisis manager. I walked into my work one day, and it was the same in the case of the Central African Republic, the same as the case in Syria with chemical weapons. And with little--really no warning--I was just told that, ""Hey, you have a new job. Guess what?"" Davidson: And how does that work? Does someone say, ""Oh, does Ban Ki-moon, the secretary-general, wants to meet with you?"" Does his--does he have an aide come and tell you? How does that literally work? Banbury: Either his chef de cabinet, what we call chef de cabinet--chief of staff, basically--who is a very, very powerful figure in the United Nations, just like the chief of staff to the president of the United States, kind of that role--or--either the chief of staff contacts me directly, or tells my boss and my boss kind of hints at it and says, ""Oh, the chief of staff wants to see you. They think they might want you to go do whatever."" So, I get a hint of it, and 20 minutes later I'm in the office being told, ""We're going to send you to go to do this or that."" And that's what happened in this case, and I said, ""I don't know anything about Ebola or public health,"" whatever. And essentially they said, ""Really, this is a crisis and we want you to be the crisis manager. Go figure it out and tell us what you think."" And -- Davidson: Because your job is not to be the subject matter expert. Your job is to get the right team together, including subject matter experts, to figure out how to solve the problem. Banbury: That's right. My job is more of a crisis manager rather than a subject expert. It's like, a commanding general isn't necessarily going to know Air Force and infantry and military engineers and all of that, but he or she needs to know how the whole thing fits together and have some kind of strategy. So, in this case I did what I always do at the beginning, which is to just try and learn, really learn as fast as I can as much as I can about the crisis, the nature of the crisis, what's really behind it, and what needs to be done, what are the objectives? And simultaneously build a team, build that multidisciplinary team of subject matter experts from across the U.N., political, humanitarian, human rights, information, security, logistics, all of that. And I always say, I don't want a representative giving you an agency like UNICEF, or a representative of the Department of Political Affairs, I want someone with expertise in politics or in food aid or whatever to come together as part of a team. Not representing their agency, but part of a team working together for the U.N. as opposed to as part of the U.N. So, learn, assemble a team, and it became very apparent to me within a week that what was missing in the crisis response was the role of crisis manager. We had a lot of entities on the ground--UNICEF, WHO, Medecins Sans Frontieres, governments, NGOs--carrying out various kinds of good activities. Running an Ebola treatment unit or doing social mobilization. But they were isolated islands of good activity without an overall strategy, without an overall coordinated response, without clear objectives. Hey, what do we need to do to end the crisis? No one could define it and no one had defined it. And I realized that no matter what we did in terms of trying to bring support in--you know, we could bring in Ebola ambulances or build treatment centers--but to what effect? You know, we needed someone to kind of run the response and no one was doing that, and no one could. And the crisis had gone well beyond just being a public health crisis, and there were lots of logistical, humanitarian, political, social, information dimensions, and thus we couldn't just rely on the public health community to lead the crisis response. It wasn't just about doctors and a treatment center, it was much, much more. We needed a crisis manager. And so, I was appointed on a Monday, Sept. 8. That Saturday on a late-night conference call with one colleague just coming out of Guinea from an assessment mission, and another colleague in London, we decided that we needed a mission. So, I recommended that to the chief of staff of the secretary-general that Sunday. She agreed. She said, ""Write it for the secretary-general."" I wrote it up at home, the home you've been in. I wrote it up on my computer looking out on the water and gave it to the secretary-general Monday. He approved it right away and said, ""Write it up for the General Assembly and the Security Council."" We did that Tuesday and Wednesday. It went Wednesday night to the Security Council and the General Assembly. Thursday the Security Council voted on a resolution on Ebola. It had the largest number of co-sponsors in the history of the United Nations, 134 co-sponsors for a Security Council resolution, almost double the previous record. So, 15 members of the Security Council, and 134 members joined those 15 expressing support as--for the resolution. And then the General Assembly voted unanimously Friday. The mission was established that Friday. So, we went from conceiving the mission to having it established in basically five working days, by far a record for the United Nations. Nothing ever comes anything close to that. Davidson: And then you were in Africa fairly soon after. Banbury: Well, right after the establishment of the mission by the secretary-general, the immediate question became, ""OK, who's going to run it?"" And I had a repeat of that exact same appearance--experience with the chef de cabinet saying, ""OK, we want you to now go run the mission."" I said, I can't go run the mission I have my job here, my family here, your nieces and nephews, who are the most important thing to me, more important than war. And I just didn't see myself in that role. Again, I don't have a public health background. And they said, ""No, please just go set it up, establish it, get it up and running, and you can come back by Christmastime."" This was, you know, by now mid- to--the second half of September. So, I agreed to do that, and a few days later went to Ghana where we were setting up our headquarters. Two days after that I was in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and I spent the next three months in West Africa setting up this mission, trying to figure it all out, what had to be done, what should the goals be? And we established these very ambitious goals for case isolation and safe burials and all that stuff that the health experts said needed to be done in order to end the crisis. And then it was all about an implementation plan, what needed to be done, by when, who was going to do it, what were the resources necessary to get it done, where were the supplies going to come from, how much was it going to cost? How were we going to monitor the performance and the implementation of the plan, so we can identify if there were gaps or weaknesses where we were falling short. All basic crisis management stuff that just hadn't been done. And so, we kind of put that all in place. Davidson: And then you didn't quite make Christmas, but you came home in January. And so now you're back at your job. Is it--how do you adjust? I mean--is that a letdown? I don't know, how do you adjust? Is it a relief to be done with those high-intensity periods? Do you now crave more of it? Are you kind of looking forward to the next time you're working at that intensity? Banbury: The Ebola mission was definitely the most sustained hard work I'd done. I mean, it was the same pace and level as the tsunami response, as Nargis, as the Haiti earthquake, but it lasted longer. We were working 12, 14 hours a day, minimum 12, maybe on a Sunday it was 10 or something. Not a single Saturday or Sunday off between Sept. 8 and Jan. 4. I mean, it was insane how hard we were working. And you're right, I came back in January instead of December because the holidays were coming, it was really hard to attract people to the mission to get them to work there, and I thought it would be very unfair of me and send the wrong signal if I was saying, yeah, people, come spend your Christmas fighting Ebola--oh, but by the way, I'm leaving. So, I agreed to stay until January. It meant in the end four months of work at that pace. And I did the math adding up--just kind of back-of-the-envelope kind of math--adding up the hours worked on weekends and the extra hours per day, and I ended up working--and this was the case for many of my colleagues--working the equivalent of three extra months in those four months, in terms of the hours. It was really insane. So, when I came back here on Jan. 4, I was totally exhausted and needed some days off, and you know, just rest, sleep. Davidson: No, I think I saw you that day and you were-- Banbury: You saw me the day I came back. Yeah, you saw me right off the plane, yeah. Davidson: And you were--yeah, I had never seen you like that. You were a zombie. Banbury: No, I was pretty--pretty shattered. Davidson: You can look at your work in Ebola, you can look at the Central African Republic, and there are--not because of you single-handedly; you had a big team and you probably made lots of mistake, I have no doubt--but there are thousands of people alive, maybe tens of thousands, I don't know, hundreds of thousands, who would be alive if those missions hadn't been successful, right? Banbury: Well, you're absolutely right to say it's a big team effort. And the Ebola response was very much a global effort. And one of the most rewarding aspects of that job--there were many--was to see the global effort. It was great to work side by side with the governments of these countries, and not--a government isn't a thing, it's a bunch of people. And so working with colleagues who became friends in Liberia, in Sierra Leone, in Guinea--good people, cool people--and I was complaining because I haven't had a day off in two months or three months--these people haven't had a day off in six months. Government workers working as hard as any human possibly could, I think. Davidson: And you probably get paid a lot more than they do. Banbury: I'm sure I get paid a lot more than they do. And they were doing it for all the right reasons. And working with NGOs, Medecins Sans Frontieres, and I haven't always agreed with MSF on some of its positions in certain crises and criticism of the U.N. In the Ebola response they were great, and I really enjoyed working with the MSF. I spent a lot of time with them. Working with the U.S. military, the U.K. military, the African Union. The Cuban doctors who were there. I really felt like part of a global response; it wasn't a U.N. response, it was a global response--for a very important cause. And that's very rewarding. And I was also privileged to work with a great bunch of U.N. friends and colleagues. I mean, really friends. The team that I was able to assemble started being called--I didn't choose the name, but it was the ""Dream Team."" These were, you know, mostly young people but hard-charging, dedicated people who still had their ideals, but didn't let the realities of the world get in their way of finding a way to solve problems. And so, they were very hands-on, flexible, figure out how to get it done, no ego, no drama, just focus on getting the job done and doing whatever it takes. And that is--it's a great environment to work in no matter where you sit, but for me as head of the team, seeing people work that hard and really being the beneficiary of their hard work, in some ways at least--I felt extremely lucky. Davidson: All right, I think that does it. Is there anything about your job or about your work that I haven't asked, that you think people would want to know or that people misunderstand? Banbury: I started my work in the U.N. in field missions, on the Thai-Cambodian border, working in refugee camps as a human rights officer. And I can just say after spending almost my whole career here now, twentysomething years, the United Nations really is a great, great place to work. Particularly field missions. Working for the United Nations in the field, whether you're a human rights officer or a political affairs officer or a logistician, it gives you the ability to be part of a noble calling and making a difference in a place in the world where they really need help. And there are--you know, be a teacher, that's a great job. I've never done it--but I'm sure you get also a lot of reward from that. Or, a solider in the US military. There are lots of ways--I always say to my kids, you know, a garbage man is providing a great service to our community and we should be grateful to them. So, there are lots of ways to contribute to society. But for me, the United Nations is certainly one of the best that they can find anywhere in the world."
