All but one of them have attacked the achievements of the last Congress--a big campaign promise--or cut spending that Republicans have targeted for years. The one outlier was a vote to provide flags in the Capitol for new Medal of Honor recipients, but conservatives will let that one slide. The other votes, like legislation that would end the public financing of elections, set the table for weeks of ""cut and grow"" programs. Ah, but there's the rub--very little of what passes the House will breathe in the Senate. So the Tea Party promise that Republicans can deliver on might be their new oversight of the administration. That kicked off properly last week. Darrell Issa's oversight committee began its hearings with a critique of how TARP has worked so far; the oversight subcommittee on energy brought Cass Sunstein to the Hill and grilled him, with only a little success, on ""job-killing"" regulation. The Senate, where Republicans don't run anything but have the ability to gum up the works, has been a promising Tea Party proving ground so far. Jim DeMint and Rand Paul have both proposed massive cuts, bigger than House Republicans want to deliver, closer to what the Tea Party wants. Sen. Pat Toomey is doing the movement a great favor with the Full Faith and Credit Act, legislation that attempts to end the ""no debt ceiling rise and America collapses"" argument by mandating that the Treasury prioritize debt repayment over anything else. The Tea Party Caucus surprised some activists when its three founding members--DeMint, Paul, and Mike Lee--voted to save the ""secret hold,"" an apparent whack at transparency. But the very existence of the caucus, which will hold as many events for activists as possible, is a nice movement victory. The Don't-Tread-on-Meter rises to 33.

Last week, prompted by the release of the anonymously authored O: A Presidential Novel, I listed my favorite political novels and asked readers to share theirs. I had picked Washington, D.C.;  The Best Man; and Advise and Consent. I knew my list was inadequate and wanted your help filling out my bookshelf, or at least helping me seem more learned around the office, which is a constant battle. Your clear favorite was Democracy, by Henry Adams. Written in 1880, it proves my point that we must reach pretty far back into history to find a decent tale about Washington. Readers said that the book captures the conflict of interests and struggle for power that has the city locked up so tight to this day. Like O, Democracy was published anonymously, and the mystery of its authorship lasted for almost 40 years. It was only until Adams died that his publisher revealed that the author of one of the great nonfiction works of all time History of the United States During the Jefferson and Madison Administrations could also write compelling fiction. Things have changed. The anonymity of the author of O didn't last a week. That's if Time magazine's Mark Halperin is correct. He reports that Mark Salter, a former close aide to John McCain, is the author of the book. The publisher boasted that the book was written by someone who ""was in the room with President Obama."" By this standard I will soon be writing a thinly veiled authoritative novel about Bob Dylan. Thanks to everyone who took the time to vote. Runner-up choices included Thank You for Smoking, Christopher Buckley's comic novel about a tobacco lobbyist (which was made into a film), Seven Days inMay, a thriller also made into a film about a military plot to overthrow the president, Echo House, the story of three generations of a powerful Washington family, and Gore Vidal's Burr about one of the most infamous founders. In the coming months, the Slate Political Gabfest will hold an audio book club on Democracy. Stay tuned for details. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter."

That was President Obama's slogan for his State of the Union address, in which he used the phrase (or a variant) 11 times. Not only is Obama courting American business, he's using tag lines from corporate marketing. But as the president spoke, the line sounded more like the title of a self-help seminar, with Obama in the role of Tony Robbins. He described a challenge to the American dream: The promise of prosperity is threatened by technology and global competition. His pitch was aimed at those Americans ""who feel like the rules have been changed in the middle of the game."" After sketching this moment of uncertainty, he quickly moved to optimism, rallying the country to its strongest traditions of perseverance and affirming that Americans have always been able to shape their own destiny. His speech was practically a 12-step program for reconnecting the American people with the dream that animated the country at its beginning. The heart of the plan was a call for investment in education, infrastructure, and energy independence. Republicans had complained before the speech that this was more of the same old Democratic deficit spending. Obama tried to pitch a more precise vision of spending, one in which government nudged investment rather than picking winners and losers in industry. He said he wanted to ""spark"" innovation. He wanted to encourage states to come up with programs to improve education and tempt companies to compete for federal dollars by coming up with innovative ideas. ""We're not just handing out money. We're issuing a challenge,"" he said. The idea is to create incentives, not issue regulations, and in so doing win the support of--or least fail to be opposed by--business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. For a president who will be judged on his ability to lower the unemployment rate, the hope is that business will hear the message in this speech and spend some of the cash that they've been accumulating knowing that the environment has improved. As another sign of the president's increasingly warm feeling about American business, he included none of the swipes at Wall Street or banks that were in the last State of the Union or his speech to Congress shortly after he took office. The political hope is that the Americans will hear this speech or hear about it and conclude that the president is thoroughly focused on the economy.  It was an opening gambit in a two-year debate with Republicans about what government should do: How big it should be. What it does well and what it doesn't. How to set its priorities. (In a sense that also made it a 2012 campaign speech.) Obama's argument is that there should be balance--smart investment and deficit reduction. Republicans want this debate to be measured by a single number--the amount by which the budget deficit is reduced. By reducing government spending and onerous regulations, the theory goes, you unleash the wisdom of the private sector, which then directs investment into activities that make the country more productive. If the competition with Republicans is about who can cut more spending, Obama is never going to win. He didn't try. He offered a five-year spending freeze for discretionary, non-defense, non-entitlement spending, a small portion of the federal budget. This was a more modest proposal than the one offered by his deficit commission (which he seems ready to ignore). The budget problem can't be fixed with cuts alone, but investment led growth of the kind the president is hoping for isn't going to do it either. The president acknowledged that to seriously attack the deficit, both parties would have to find a way to cut entitlements, but he didn't offer a suggestion. ""We do big things,"" he said of America. But apparently not when it comes to the deficit. At least not in this speech. ""It was depressingly vague,"" said Maya MacGuineas of the Center for a Responsible Budget. ""If the president is going to spend some of his political capital on this issue, we may well run out of time before we turn this situation around."" But there are advantages to the president's approach. If he'd announced a big plan for cuts, that would have been the story coming out of the speech. It would have muddled his message of uplift. Also, whatever budget cuts the president really thinks are sensible, as a negotiating tactic it would be wise to announce a smaller target so that he can have something to negotiate with in the coming battle with Republicans. Just as he ultimately gave in and allowed the Bush tax cuts to be extended for the most wealthy in order to get a second round of stimulus spending, perhaps he'll give in on more spending reductions to get more of the spending he wants. This was the president's most sustained pitch for a government equal to the spirit of the American people and history, but it wasn't the first. In his last State of the Union he cited the Civil War and World War II in calling for another dose of determination and grit. This time he said America faced another Sputnik moment. He was referring to the Soviet Union's satellite launch that spurred the creation of NASA. The problem with this analogy, aside from those that my colleague Fred Kaplan points out, is that the stakes aren't as high. The Soviets were first in space, which meant they were getting better at the technology that one day might be used in weapons that could destroy us. People don't feel that way about China, at least not yet. The analogy may also have been lost on those who did not experience that period in American history. Fortunately for the president, his analogy about the past wasn't crucial to his vision for the future. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter."

3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/01/put_me_in_coach.html	"Before every State of the Union address, aides to the president say that their man will avoid a dull laundry-list speech that ticks off everything he's done and plans to do. But interest groups, not to mention Cabinet members, like to hear their projects mentioned. So despite the best efforts of the president's aides and speechwriters--and maybe even the presence of a few rhetorical flourishes--there is an inevitable moment in every State of the Union speech when out come the socks and T-shirts. President Obama's aides are making all the familiar promises about his State of the Union. Maybe they will succeed and Tuesday's speech won't sound like a list. Even so, it will fall into a formula. Obama's speech is likely to include three parts--not a list, mind you!--that will allow the president to, yes, tell us about everything he's done and plans to do. Opening argument: The president and Republican leaders have both promised to shrink the budget deficit. For the next two years, they will fight over how much and how fast. In his speech, Obama will make his first attempt to frame that debate. His message: balance. There must be hard choices about reducing government spending, but the budget deficit cannot be reduced by cutting alone. The economy must also grow, which means making American business more competitive. To do that, the president will argue, the federal government will have to make smart investments in education, infrastructure and technology. Republicans attacked the president's plans before he announced them. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said it sounded like the same old reflex to spend, which burdens future generations and shrinks access to capital. To rebut this charge, the president will align himself with American CEOs. Last week, after naming General Electric Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Immelt to head the new  Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, Obama argued that such investments are as important as free trade, something the GOP tends to support. When Tom Donohue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, argued recently that investment was necessary to ""restoring"" America's ""economic foundation,"" he sounded a lot like Obama will sound on Tuesday. In the past two years, Republicans have often pointed to Obama's strained relationship with American business as proof that his liberal policies were bad for the economy. He hopes the opposite will be true: If business is onboard with his plan to cut and invest, he'll be able to use that as a shield against GOP charges. Pep talk: In recent days, the president has started to sound like a coach at the start of the season. His most recent radio address was titled ""We Can Out-Compete Any Other Nation."" In a message to supporters he said his State of the Union address would lay out his plan to ""win the future."" The president is trying to get everyone enthusiastic about all the wind-sprints and push-ups he's going to ask them to do. Last year, the president promised a difficult conversation about the choices the country must make to reduce the budget deficit. He's been giving previews of the conversation ever since the campaign. The most recent version was in North Carolina in December. Here's the short version: America is flabby. Our deficit is too large, and our workers and students aren't being trained for the future. In a competitive global economy, this is a recipe for failure. China and India will advance. ""As it stands right now, the hard truth is this,"" he said last month. ""In the race for the future, America is in danger of falling behind."" This all sounds very depressing. But Obama will promise a Hollywood ending. ""This is our moment,"" he said in North Carolina. ""If the recession has taught us anything, it's that we cannot go back to an economy that's driven by too much spending, too much borrowing, running up credit cards, taking out a lot of home equity loans, paper profits that are built on financial speculation. We've got to rebuild on a new and stronger foundation for economic growth. We need to do what America has always been known for: building, innovating, educating, making things. We don't want to be a nation that simply buys and consumes products from other countries. We want to create and sell products all over the world that are stamped with three simple words: 'Made in America.' "" Renewal of vows: In 2008, Obama did well among independent voters. In the 2010 election, independent voters helped elect Republicans. So the president and his aides are working to improve relations with that constituency. In tone and tenor the speech promises to be very much in keeping with the recalibration we've seen since the election that has included the deal with Republicans to extend the Bush tax cuts, the hiring of several pragmatic Clinton-era veterans, and the focus on courting American business interests. All of this may explain why recent polls show the president has made modest improvement with that constituency. A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that 40 percent of those questioned labeled the president a ""moderate"" compared to the 45 percent who saw him as a liberal, and 11 percent who viewed him as a conservative. That moderate number was his highest ever in the poll. If the president rebuilds his relationship with independent voters, it may be because of a notion with which he doesn't exactly agree: that he somehow wandered off-course in his first two years in office and is now finding his way back. Obama's preferred argument is that he spent his first two years rescuing the economy, and now that he's done that, he can focus on growing it. Whichever explanation people buy--whether Obama 2.0 is the result of his own hand or circumstance--the message the president wants to convey is the same: the candidate who ran on change is also capable of it.

4	4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/01/bouncing.html	"The bounce in the polls for Barack Obama's presidency is real. There have been some fun attempts at shredding it, like this regression at the aptly named blog Yes, But, However! These attempts are all futile. The NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll,  New York Times/CBS News poll, Washington Post/ABC News poll are not simultaneously wrong, and the polling average points unmistakably up. If you remove the laughable Zogby Internet poll--I think Mike Gravel is winning the 2012 primary in the universe where this is conducted--Obama's at 49.5 percent, knocking on the door of majority support. So there is a minor Obama recovery afoot. His adroit response to the shootings in Tucson definitely helped. The interesting questions are why it's happening and whether it matters. * Voters are pretty well satisfied with the thrashing they gave Obama two months ago. He had it coming, as far as they're concerned; he's got another chance to please or disappoint them. In the NBC News/WSJ poll that gives Obama a 53 percent approval rating, voters split 39/39 on whether Obama is facing just ""short-term setbacks."" When voters took George W. Bush's Republican majority away four years ago, 65 percent of them said he was facing long-term setbacks, that things were unlikely to get any better. They'd given up on the guy. In contrast, by about a 2-1 margin in the NBC News/WSJ poll, voters think Obama will ""strike the right balance"" with the new Congress. By a smaller margin, they think that Congress will be ""too inflexible"" as it deals with him. Only 45 percent of voters think Obama is ""very"" or ""somewhat"" liberal, which matters, because ""liberal"" has been a political demerit roughly since George Lucas thought that remaking  The Hidden Fortress with lasers might be a marketable idea. Should we be surprised by this? No. This is what happens when Americans punish a charismatic liberal president and he acts suitably chastened. Bill Clinton's Democrats were devastated in 1994, and he had a much less productive lame-duck session with which to win back liberal support. Yet a CNN/Time poll released on Jan. 8, 1995 gave Clinton a sizable bounce, from 41 percent job approval to 47 percent; disapproval fell from 49 percent to 44 percent. * Conservatives, by winning the election, have peaked in popularity--for now. Look at the internals of the Washington Post/ABC News poll. Those pollsters have been asking about voters' impressions of the Tea Party movement for a year. When they began, 35 percent of voters viewed the movement favorably, and 40 percent viewed it unfavorably. The numbers have moved back and forth a bit. Today, once again, 35 percent of voters like the Tea Party movement. It's just that 52 percent of them don't, and by a 10-point margin they think the movement has ""crossed the line"" in its rhetoric. The Post/ABC poll contains plenty more reasons why Obama holds an advantage over the GOP. Republicans have pointed out that for the first time in a while, they are tied with the president when voters are asked who they trust to fix the health care system. That's the only question that Republicans lead on, though. On Afghanistan, on terrorism, on taxes (thanks, probably, to that December deal), and on the mysterious indicator of helping out the middle class, Obama leads. This week's Fox News poll is--surprise!--gloomier for the Democrats. But its very first question demonstrates why Republicans don't have much room to gain on the president right now. A plurality of voters, 45 percent, want the president and Congress to ""focus on"" the economy and jobs. Only 14 percent want to see a focus on health care, and that number is that high mostly because 19 percent of Democrats feel that way. Only 10 percent of independent and Republicans are focused on it. That's why Republicans are careful to add the modifiers ""job-killing"" or (new tone!) ""job-destroying"" to the health-care bill--it's an attempt to show their repeal effort is really about the economy. It's an almost perfect mirror of the problem Democrats faced in 2009 and 2010, when they went to great lengths to explain that their focus on health care was not, not, not a distraction from unemployment. That, of course, is Obama's problem. That's the reason not to start plotting this line into 2012. * Voters think the economy is going to recover. The president has recovered in the polls before, and the recovery has always come when voters think they're going to get jobs again. In the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 40 percent of people polled said the economy would improve ""during the next 12 months,"" and 17 percent said it would get worse. But people were even more optimistic in September 2009. That month, 47 percent said the economy would improve, and 20 percent said it would get worse. No news there: If the economy improves, voters will look more warmly on president Obama. If it doesn't, Obama is going through his latest false dawn. It gets worse. There's not much coordination yet between Obama's own approval numbers and the performance of Democratic candidates. Obama had positive approval numbers in November 2009, when Democrats lost the governors' mansions in Virginia and New Jersey. He had positive approval numbers in January 2010, when Scott Brown blazed past the handshake-phobic Martha Coakley and won a U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts. He had mildly positive approval numbers in the spring of 2010, after health care reform passed, and slipped into the 40s by the midterms, as the economy didn't recover. We're not talking about 2012 yet, though. The unmistakable, grand, break-out-the-Cristal news in all of these polls is that Obama comfortably leads every potential Republican candidate for his job. He only leads them because for the third or fourth time, Americans want to think the economy's about to turn a corner. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

This is a frequent problem in the House of Representatives, no matter who runs it. Nancy Pelosi's majority passed around 300 bills that never got anywhere in the Senate. That Senate, you'll recall, had a bigger Democratic majority than at any time since the 1970s. Democrats still could hardly get anything through it. Republicans are in an even weaker position. On Wednesday, they concluded a protracted vote on the ""Repeal of the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act."" (Yes, a ""law act."" It rolls off the tongue.) They won, 245 to 189, but they were expected to win, and after that they were--and are--expected to go no further. But they tried. They started with a disadvantage, because the horrific events two weeks ago in Tucson stopped the business of Congress for a week, erasing their momentum. Instead of answering questions about repeal, they were gritting their teeth through a week of questions about the ""new political tone"" that Washington direly needed and talking about whether they'd shuffle the seating at the State of the Union to be more bipartisan. ""I don't know where I'll be sitting yet,"" joked Majority Leader Eric Cantor at the start of a Tuesday briefing, part of the repeal-vote kick-off. Then he got the obvious question: What will Republicans do after health care repeal dies in the Senate? ""I don't necessarily accept the fact ..."" Cantor began, before starting a new line of argument. ""If Harry Reid is so confident that he's got the votes in the Senate, he should bring it up, if he's got the votes."" It was smart--a dare for the Senate to bring up a bill, implying that it had a chance in hell of passing. It got headlines. It just didn't matter, because Reid's office knocked it down flat. I checked in with the offices of senators who had talked about their problems with the health care law, or who were in tough re-election battles. There was no sign of any Democratic support for repeal, which suggests that it won't even get a majority--it needs 60 votes to break cloture--if it comes for a vote. But Republicans tried. They had promised voters they'd try. They promised it, and Tea Party activists expected it. After Cantor spoke to reporters, the originators of 2010's repeal bills, Reps. Steve King and Michele Bachmann, ventured into the chill outside to show off half a million petition signatures collected by RepealItNow, one of the better-connected anti-""Obamacare"" groups. They introduced one another to their spokespeople. They reunited with Jenny Beth Martin, the likeable leader of Tea Party Patriots, who was in town with around 100 other activists to watch the vote. ""Jenny Beth!"" said Bachmann, admiring the Tea Party leader's blue, buckled coat. ""You look so hot!"" Bachmann, King, and three more members of Congress ambled up to a podium and explained that they were about to fulfill the promise they made in 2010. If anyone wanted to argue that this repeal vote was meaningless, they just weren't playing the long game like Republicans were. ""This is the consent of the governed that is speaking out now for the first time!"" said Bachmann, pointing to a stack of petitions. ""It is step one, phase one, beginning tomorrow. It is a journey you will see a strong, committed House conservative majority standing behind. We are not going to check the box off, have one vote, and move on."" The hard-liners had to confront two problems. First, the only people who thought the repeal vote would advance the cause of defunding and dismantling health care--that it was more than a symbol--were Tea Partiers, who were about to learn how cruel the Senate is. Martin told me that the activists newly in town would watch the vote happen from the Senate; they expected, at first, that an immediate Senate vote would come after the House vote. (""This was never in the cards."") Second, Democrats were responding to the repeal push by getting granular about the bill, warning that Republicans would scrap the popular stuff, not just the unpopular (and Heritage Foundation-inspired) mandate to buy insurance. The argument was possibly expressed the best way in a floor speech by Massachusetts Rep. Richard Neal, who attacked Republicans for saying reform would bankrupt the country and force end-of-life choices on the elderly. ""They're using a lexicon designed to scare people,"" said Neal. The very next sentence: ""Let me tell you what this proposal does--it eliminates 50 million people from getting health insurance!"" Republicans were ready for this line of attack. That is, they were ready to dismiss it. At the King/Bachmann Tea Party press conference, one reporter asked about a forthcoming Health and Human Services study that suggests 129 million Americans under 65 might have the sort of pre-existing conditions that could lead insurance companies to deny them care. Rep. Louie Gohmert literally laughed this off. Later, in the floor debate, Rep. Phil Gingrey laughed it off harder. ""One hundred and twenty nine million people with pre-existing conditions?"" scoffed Gingrey. ""They'd all have to have hangnails and blisters for that to add up. If you believe that number I've got a beach in Pennsylvania to sell you."" The HHS report was, at least, new information. Virtually nothing said during the three-day debate--it started before Tucson--was new. Only the people were new. The debate served as a way for freshman members of Congress, dozens of them conservatives who'd based their campaigns on opposing ""Obamacare,"" to introduce themselves as fulfillers of a promise. Morgan Griffith, a Virginia freshman who'd come out of the state legislature and passed its opt-out of the health care mandate, used his time to inform the Congress that his state was winning its legal fight. ""No Virginian should be required to buy health care insurance,"" said Griffith. ""As a Virginian, we did not accept the chains of George III, and we will not accept the chains of Obamacare."" Republicans introduced their peers to cancer patients who could be cured only because the United States had not wrecked its health care system with socialism. Democrats introduced their own Lifetime-movie-ready characters from their districts; wretches who had been saved by the grace of ""Obamacare."" Rep. Steve Israel, the Democrat tasked with ending the GOP majority in 2012, spoke of Hanna, a girl with spina bifida who was on the verge of losing coverage. ""Why would you want to say to Hanna, we're going to take away those protections, Hanna?"" Israel said. A few dozen Republicans and a few dozen Democrats listened, nodded, or moved around the chamber, waiting for the debate to wrap. When it finally wrapped, the act passed with about as few votes as either side could have predicted. Thirteen current members of the Democratic conference had voted against the health care bill in March. Only three of them--Reps. Dan Boren, Mike McIntyre, and Mike Ross--voted for repeal. ""It's largely a symbolic vote,"" shrugged sophomore Democratic Rep. Jared Polis. He suggested Democrats could join Republicans and roll back a new requirement for businesses to fill out additional tax forms. There just wouldn't be any comity on repeal or defunding. ""It's a one or two day story. It's a way to get this talked about, and then we move onto other things."" Not far away from Polis, Steve King was in a happy mood. His BlackBerry was buzzing with press releases from FreedomWorks and Republican leaders about what they'd achieved. What they'd achieved was a repeal vote that he'd been asking for since March 2010. But I asked him what would be the difference between this vote and the many, many House proposals that die in the Senate, that fail to create or roll back anything significant--those 300 Democratic bills, or the 2007 attempt to defund the Iraq War, things like that. ""The difference is, they were not in sync with the American people,"" said King. ""We could not be more in sync with the American people!"" Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

6	6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/01/good_riddance_joe_lieberman.html	"My corner of Connecticut was covered in ice today, until news broke of Sen. Joe Lieberman's impending retirement. Magically, a warm glow spread. It was a delicious feeling: the end of the reign of the politician I despise most. Why do I loathe, loathe, loathe my 68-year-old four-term senator? My feelings are all the stronger for being fairly irrational. Lieberman's views are closer to mine than many politicians on whom I don't expend one iota of emotional energy. This, of course, is his power: He never loses his power to disappoint. Then there is the spectacle of it all: After each act of grand or petty betrayal, each time he turned on his former supporters, the Democratic Party and the Obama administration came back begging for more. Throughout the last Congress, he never let anyone forget he was the 60th vote. It wasn't always so, at least not to me. When I first moved to Connecticut in 1989, during Lieberman's first term, he seemed entirely unobjectionable. In 1998, after I moved to the state a second time, I went to hear him speak. In 2001, I wrote a respectful piece for the Washington Post (I can't find it online) about how Lieberman's observance of Jewish law, as Al Gore's running mate, had offered a welcome means for thinking about the accommodation of religious differences. What was I thinking? How did I miss the sanctimony beneath the kippah? As my friend Caleb puts it, ""Even when he was a good liberal Democrat (coming up through the state legislature and as attorney general in the '70s and '80s, for example), it was driven, I am sure, by opportunism rather than conviction."" Another friend, Judy Chevalier, burned up her iPad tonight when I asked her to enumerate why she hates Joe Lieberman. She ticked off a half-dozen reasons and then said, ""The thing is, I did not come up with most of these myself. They come from many rounds of playing the peculiar Connecticut liberal cocktail party game 'I hated Joe Lieberman before you hated Joe Lieberman.' "" Longtime Lieberman haters, she says, look all the way back to 1993, when Lieberman led a hedge-fund-friendly charge in the Senate against the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which at the time wanted to close the accounting loophole that let corporations duck the recording of stock options on their balance sheets. More old-timer liberal grudges against Lieberman: He denounced Bill Clinton in 1998 over Monica Lewinsky, a gift to the president's enemies. He selfishly held on to his Senate seat in 2000 when he ran with Gore; if they'd won, Lieberman's replacement would have been appointed by a Republican governor. A creative grudge from Caleb: Lieberman failed to bury Dick Cheney in the vice-presidential debate in 2000 because ""he clearly had no interest in showing the public what kind of leader Cheney really would be."" Judy points out that in 2006, Lieberman opposed an effort to require all hospitals, including Catholic ones, to make the morning after pill available to rape victims. He said glibly, ""In Connecticut, it shouldn't take more than a short ride to get to another hospital."" On to the more familiar recent history: Lieberman's unrequited, unquenchable love for the Iraq war. (All the more misguided if, as my friend David thinks, Lieberman saw his hawkishness as in the service of Israel and Jewish identity in America.) His romance with John McCain, which won him a speaking role at the 2008 Republican National Convention. His irritating, me-me-me flirtation with caucusing with the Republicans after he lost his Democratic primary to Ned Lamont and then won the 2006 general election running as an Independent. In 2009, it was Lieberman who held the health care bill hostage so he could kill the Democrats' proposal to let people get health insurance coverage by buying into Medicare--even though, as Ezra Klein points out, he'd endorsed the same proposal months earlier. Ezra calls Lieberman ""erratic and seemingly unprincipled"" during the health care debate but then gives him credit for delivering one of the handful of swing votes that allowed the bill to pass. I am not willing to be so forgiving.  Should his vote have been so hard to get? Was this all about pleasing the Connecticut insurance companies? And then there's more: In July, Lieberman swaggered about a possible U.S. strike against Iran. In September, he was the one leading the way toward extending the Bush tax cuts for every last millionaire. This brings back the memory of the kiss George Bush gave him at the 2005 State of the Union address. And then, most infuriating of all, Lieberman ended the last Congress by doing something good. He resurrected the repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell"" in the Senate last month. Afterward he said, ""America became an even greater and stronger country today."" I couldn't agree more.  On Salon, Alex Pareene said that it was still OK to hate Joe Lieberman, but for a moment, I wobbled. Would I have to forgive Lieberman, however grudgingly? The answer is no. Pareene stiffened my spine by bringing up one sin I'd forgotten: After the arrest of Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad, Lieberman proposed a bill that would have automatically stripped Americans of citizenship for being charged--not convicted--with a terrorist act. Add that one to the list. And surely I've left out various Lieberman lows you should alert me to in the comments. Dave Weigel says that Lieberman could not have won a fifth term in 2012 because at 31 percent last October, his approval ratings were too low. Maybe so, but now I realize I've missed my chance to vote against him. My friend Leslie says that her vote for him in the primaries in 2006 is the vote she regrets most; I wasn't living in Connecticut that year. Even Lieberman's retirement announcement is an irritant. I'll never get to throw the bum out. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	Joe Lieberman's retirement announcement: Why I loathe him.	['Israel', 'Clinton', 'Obama']	[]
7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/01/best_interns_ever.html	After reading about the heroic efforts of Daniel Hernandez, the intern who may have saved Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' life on Saturday, we asked you to tell us about stories of memorable interns you had known, heard of or read about. Here are the best ones. Gabrielle Wimer: In October 2008, Wimer, a then-24-year-old criminal justice major at Grossmont College, cracked a 36-year-old cold case for the San Diego Police Department. By resubmitting old fingerprint evidence to the FBI, she found the murderer of Vietnam vet and postal worker Jerry Jackson. Although detectives had the fingerprint evidence in 1972, when Jackson was stabbed to death, they didn't have a national database. They also weren't watching  CSI, which may have helped young Wimer. Vivien Thomas: An African-American with only a high school degree, Thomas took a job as an assistant in Dr. Alfred Blalock's Vanderbilt University animal laboratory in 1930. He was hired at first as a janitor, and began his career feeding the laboratory animals and cleaning cages. But it wasn't long before Blalock discovered that Thomas was smart and apparently had remarkable hand-eye coordination. When Blalock became the chief of surgery at Johns Hopkins University Medical School in 1941, he asked Thomas to join his surgical team there. In 1976, after supervising surgical laboratories at Johns Hopkins for more than 35 years, Thomas was named instructor in surgery. He died in 1985. Albert Schatz:  Schatz was the Rutgers University graduate student who co-discovered the antibiotic streptomycin, the first antibiotic that was effective against tuberculosis and could also treat cholera and bubonic plague. Schatz isolated the strain in 1943 when he was working in the lab of microbiologist Selman Waksman. At first, the discovery was attributed only to Waksman. But in 1950, Schatz filed a suit against him, demanding that he be named as a co-discoverer of streptomycin. In 1952, Waksman received the Nobel Prize for the discovery, and Schatz eventually got his wish: Today, he's recognized as an instrumental player in the antibiotic's discovery.  He died in 2005. Michael Faraday:  Faraday, whose discoveries led to the invention of the electric motor, was 20 when he got his big break. It was 1812, and he was nearing the end of a seven-year apprenticeship with a bookbinder and bookseller in England. During his apprenticeship, he had become fascinated with science books, especially the ones about electricity. When a customer in the bookbinder's shop invited Faraday to attend a lecture by Humphry Davy--one of the foremost scientists at England's Royal Institution--he jumped at the chance. Faraday took 300 pages of notes during the lecture, sent Davy all of them, and asked for a job. Luckily, Davy was flattered rather than creeped out, even though he at first told Faraday he couldn't hire him. Later, after a lab accident damaged his eyes, Davy appointed Faraday to the job of chemical assistant at the Royal Institution. Faraday was eventually appointed to the position of Fullerian professor of chemistry. Jules Feiffer: When Feiffer, a cartoonist and writer, asked his mentor, Will Eisner, for a job, he said he would work for no money. That alone might have guaranteed his success. He started working on Eisner's comic strip, The Spirit, at age 16, and soon proved he could do more than write balloons based on Eisner's storyline. In 1947, when Feiffer was 18, he started his own comic strip, Clifford, which launched in 1949. He became famous for another strip, Feiffer, and won a Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning in 1986. Jocelyn Bell Burnell: Burnell was at Cambridge University in 1967 working on her doctorate when she detected the first known radio pulsar, a type of neutron star that emanates radio waves and electromagnetic radiation. Her main job as a research student under adviser Anthony Hewish was to monitor the radio transmissions coming in through Cambridge's radiotelescope. But her monotonous, internlike job of chart analysis became more interesting when she noticed strange signals that appeared to be coming from outside the solar system. Like most assistants, interns, and apprentices, Burnell's role in the pulsar discovery was downplayed. Anthony Hewish and Sir Martin Ryle, another Cambridge scientist, received the Nobel Prize in Physics for the pulsar discovery. Burnell still managed to lead a successful life as a professor, examiner, and consultant: She was president of the Royal Astronomical Society from 2002 and 2004 and president of the Institute of Physics from October 2008 through October 2010.

Writing in the pages of the Washington Post, McCain praises President Obama for his remarks at the Tucson memorial on Wednesday and makes his own commitment to not let his passion get the best of him. He also bears witness. Referring to the president, McCain writes: ""He is a patriot sincerely intent on using his time in office to advance our country's cause. I reject accusations that his policies and beliefs make him unworthy to lead America or opposed to its founding ideals."" McCain also defends Sarah Palin, though he never mentions her name. Using the same call to empathy and the golden rule that Obama invoked in his speech in Tucson, McCain asks that those who criticized Palin and other conservatives put themselves in her shoes:"	John McCain on Obama's speech: Can he return to his old bipartisan self?

9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/01/the_solution_do_nothing.html	"Barney Frank had left the floor of the House for a moment. Dozens of his fellow members were in the chamber saluting the work of their colleague Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and the lives of six people who were killed when a gunman opened fire at one of her public meetings. I stopped Frank to ask him what he thought of the bill, soon to be introduced by Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., to ban the high-capacity magazines that the alleged shooter had used. ""The Republicans are in power and have generally opposed it,"" said Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat. I started to point out that some of Frank's fellow Democrats were arguing that Saturday's tragedy changed the legislative picture because it directly affected a member of the House. Frank politely interrupted me. ""I'm sorry, don't argue with me,"" he said. ""Have you read what John Boehner said? Do you know who Republicans are? I'm telling you what they say, and you're going to give me a logical argument for it? There's always been a separate argument for how much you should be able to shoot without reloading. It doesn't interfere with your right to defend your home, or shoot a deer, or anything. But given the Republicans' religious view of this, I don't see how it's going to happen."" It's unusual that a political assassination attempt doesn't prompt a debate on gun control. On Monday, I reported that the most likely response from legislators to the Giffords shooting would happen in Arizona, not Washington, and it would be an expansion of gun rights, rather than a restriction of them: The theory is that armed citizens or legislators could act more quickly to stop a future Jared Lee Loughner. Sam Stein reports today that gun-control activists are looking past Congress, to the states, for any possible wins. So maybe Frank was right. Maybe it was a waste of time for me to spend most of Wednesday asking members of Congress what sort of odds gun-control- or mental-health-funding legislation had. Some members tactfully explained that discussion like this could wait for another day. Others reacted to the question as if they'd been asked whether there should be stiffer regulations on what kind of shoes dragons are allowed to wear. ""I maintain, as Americans have believed since the American founding, that firearms in the hands of law-abiding citizens make communities safer, not less safe,"" said Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind., a potential presidential candidate, of the magazine-ban legislation. When it was pointed out that citizens aren't allowed to own, say, machine guns, he criticized the attitude of a city where this could even be asked. ""I think, particularly in Washington, D.C., the desire is to move immediately off and find something else to blame, and find some public policy that's wanting. I think what we had here was a despicable human being."" There are now at least four federal legislative responses to the Tucson tragedy: McCarthy's bill; a bill from Rep. Bob Brady, D-Pa., to criminalize some violent imagery; a bill from Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., to ban firearms within 1,000 yards of federal officials; and, paradoxically, a bill from Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert to allow members of Congress to carry their guns inside the Capitol. (It's legal in Texas!) After some tragedies, there have been instant surges of support for legislation sold as preventative. The PATRIOT Act sailed through in 2001. After the 2007 shootings at Virginia Tech, McCarthy sponsored--and President Bush signed--legislation to connect mental-health records more closely to the National Instant Criminal Background Check system. None of that's happening this time. One difference is that this shooting rattled Congress itself; most of Wednesday was spent on that Giffords resolution and on prayer services for other victims. But more important, this is not the Congress that passed the PATRIOT Act or the post-Virginia Tech bill. It's the Tea Party Congress. That was never clearer than when dozens of freshmen and staunch conservatives who are popular in the movement lined up to sign the Giffords condolence book, then explained to reporters why the worst possible response to the tragedy would be some new bill--on guns, on mental health, on anything. ""If I'm shot,"" Gohmert told me, ""I want it prosecuted under the laws of the state of Texas, not federal law. That's just the way it is. There's just a lot more teeth in the state law. And if somebody pursues me and shoots me because of hatred for a group I'm part of, then I don't want it prosecuted under the hate-crime law that was so entirely unnecessary."" Rep. John Campbell, R-Calif., ruled out any gun laws immediately and suggested that local law enforcement was in the best position to prevent any future Tucsons. A mental health bill? ""In California, we had a special income tax for mental health funding,"" he said. ""It's since been rescinded, since we ran out of money! And I'm not sure you can point to that as a way to solve this. The question is, was this guy out there enough that people would have felt comfortable to haul him off to the funny farm, to use the old term of art?"" This might explain why so much of the discussion of Tucson has focused on factors that, according to what we know, had nothing to do with Tucson. Members of Congress from both parties fielded question after question today about whether they'd change their tone. Midway through the morning, the national dialogue turned to a video from Sarah Palin, who'd become the mascot for pre-Tucson mixing of gun metaphors and political metaphors. By the afternoon, Politico had five ready links to the Palin debate, including ""Sarah Palin charges critics with 'blood libel,' "" ""Republicans disappointed at Palin,"" and the more meta ""Sarah Palin's 'blood libel' claim draws criticism."" That criticism was led by Congress. Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., used his time during the Giffords tribute to read off a list of ""pretty awful"" remarks by Republicans, which apparently had nothing to do with Loughner's decision to empty a clip into innocent people at a congressional event. Why not debate Palin, and why not debate the tone? By the end of Wednesday there was a USA Today/Gallup poll revealing that only 35 percent of Americans thought it was legitimate to blame conservatives for the tragedy, but only around 20 percent wanted more gun control. Recall why the Palin connection was made so often in the media. Giffords, a gun owner and Second Amendment supporter, said in a 2010 interview she worried about the ""consequences"" of Palin's ""target"" map. She did not say she suddenly supported more gun control. Supporters of McCarthy's bill, like Rep. Rush Holt, D-N.J., were left to argue that they needed a shift in the national sentiment if they were going to get their way. ""We've got to go beyond specific, limiting legislation,"" said Holt. ""We've got to change our gun-crazed society."" He smiled wryly at what he'd just said. ""Not easy to do!"" Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

10	10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/01/from_texas_to_arizona.html	"For the second time in his tenure, President Obama will eulogize the victims of a shooting. In November 2009--it now seems another era--he gave a small masterpiece of a speech in honor of the 13 people killed when Army Maj. Nidal Hasan allegedly opened fire at Fort Hood in Texas. When Obama speaks Wednesday night in Tucson, he will of course memorialize those killed and wounded when Jared Lee Loughner allegedly opened fire. He is at his best telling stories. But Obama will also have to talk about tolerance. And he will have to find a way to talk about the need to civilize our debate when he is aligned with only one side in that debate. Even addressing the idea of tolerance is going to close some ears. Conservatives will hear an accusation even if he says there is no connection between the shooter and Tea Party rhetoric. If there's no connection, why are you bringing it up--at a memorial service, of all places? Liberals who hear the president call out his own side will be irritated by the false equivalence. How can you compare us in any way to those people who say you hold office illegally? The solution may be to focus not on the political conversation that existed before the shooting but on the one that's come out of it. This allows the president to avoid the question of what motivated the shooter but does not limit his ability to talk about the problems with our political culture. He has fresh evidence, minted by the hour, of the problems of our political conversation. Not long after the shooting, it became just another chapter in an ongoing fight. After the shooting, Markos Moulitsas tweeted, ""Mission accomplished, Sarah Palin."" Tea Party Nation founder Judson Phillips urged followers to blame the shooting on ""the left."" Anthropologists on either side looked for clues in the shooter's background to support their case that he was motivated by the ideology of the other side. Then, when the debate moved to a new phase, they traded facts from the past to attack or defend. The pattern of debate is not dissimilar to that which follows the release of cost estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. This was a tragedy, yes. But it was also an opportunity. When you are engaged in a desperate fight with an opponent so outside the bounds of reason, a catastrophe like this is irresistible. It serves as the last word in the fight: See, conservative talk is dangerous. Or: See, liberals will immediately turn any tragedy into a political weapon regardless of the facts. Or, from the media: If you can make your point quickly, we would like to book you for our program. Sure, we want a reasoned debate, but not at the expense of speed. Better to be wrong, loud, and fast than slow and considered. In the past, the president has tried to find a reasonable middle ground by illuminating how each side shares the blame. It's not clear how effective that is. Both sides are obsessed with magnitude. Sure, partisans may admit, we may jump to conclusions and mangle the facts to make our point--but the other side does it more! That's not the issue. The issue is speed and lack of restraint. The president has the chance to make the case that the speed with which the old battle flared anew is proof that both sides have locked themselves into a self-perpetuating and unproductive cycle. Saturday's shooting did not create a pause in the confrontation--it accelerated it. This is not just unhealthy; it's abnormal. How many Americans are actually engaged in this debate? Not as many as the number of comments on Sarah Palin's Facebook page would lead you to believe. Proof of that can be found in the lives of those who Obama will be in Tucson to mourn. Leave the anthropological inquiries into the mind of Jared Lee Loughner to the pundits. Obama can perform a valuable service by telling us more about the lives that were lost. Two of them were public servants: Judge John Roll and Gabe Zimmerman (who handled community outreach for Rep. Gabrielle Giffords). Three were retirees who had simply lived by the grace of their daily obligations--raising children, attending church, hating the snow back East.  Mavy Stoddard believes that her 76-year-old husband, Dorwan, died because he shielded her with his body when the shooting started. Nine-year-old Christina Taylor Green wanted to be a politician. * This will serve as a welcome balance to the obsessive coverage of the shooter. It will also remind us of lives that are measured not by the number of arguments won or Twitter followers gained. All the president has to do to restore a little balance to this debate is talk about the people whose lives it did not define. In doing so, he will make the case for tolerance far better than any words directly aimed at the topic. Become a fan of  Slate and  John Dickerson on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter.

11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/01/kepler_was_an_intern_too.html	"When I was a junior in high school, I interned for Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois. I answered the phone. I created a database of important addresses. The one time I met her, I shook her hand and stuttered an unimpressive introduction. I did not, at any point, save her life. In other words, I was no Daniel Hernandez, the University of Arizona junior who may have saved the life of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords after she was shot in the head on Saturday. Not too many interns save their boss's life--but Hernandez is not the first to do more than balance multiple coffee orders and struggle with fax machines. To celebrate his efforts, we at Slatewanted to honor remarkable interns throughout history. But a lot of the interns we found were notoriously remarkable--for their involvement in a sex scandal, for example. So we're calling on you, readers, to recall some of the most memorable interns, apprentices, or assistants you've ever known, heard of, or read about. Which intern in an obscure lab made a significant medical discovery? Perhaps a college freshman working at a local newspaper broke an important story? Send us their stories at slateinterns@gmail.com. We'll publish the best ones next week. In the meantime, to get you thinking, here is a selection of a few memorable interns. Daniel Hernandez: Hernandez, who was working the sign-in table at Giffords' ""Congress on Your Corner"" event, ran toward Giffords as soon as he heard gunshots. He applied pressure to her head to stop the blood loss and moved her body so she could breathe without inhaling blood. Monica Lewinsky: No intern list is complete without Lewinsky's salacious story. The White House intern's affair with President Bill Clinton led to his impeachment in 1998. Lewinsky wasn't an intern that entire time: She was hired to be a full-time staffer after a successful stint as a summer intern. Chandra Levy: Levy, then a 24-year-old graduate student, was an intern at the Federal Bureau of Prisons in 2000 when she met Rep. Gary Condit of California. The two began to have an affair. She disappeared in May 2001, and the affair was subsequently exposed. Authorities were suspicious of Condit, but he was never indicted. In 2010, Ingmar Guandique, a man already in prison, was convicted of Levy's murder. Louis Lusky: Technically he was not an intern, but Louis Lusky wrote what's often called the most important footnote in constitutional law while he was a law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Harlan Fiske Stone in 1938. In Carolene Products v. United States, Lusky introduced the idea of applying varying levels of judicial scrutiny to different kinds of legislation, specifically in regards to statutes directed at religious and racial minorities. Johannes Kepler: Kepler discovered that planets move in elliptical orbits while working as an apprentice (some reports call him an assistant) to astronomer Tycho Brahe. Also, after studying Brahe's data, Kepler came up with the three Laws of Planetary Motion. Other than that, his apprenticeship was uneventful. Jayson Blair: Blair was a summer intern at the New York Times in June 1998. The talented young writer got his internship extended, then continued as an intern and junior reporter for four years. Even though he made a plethora of mistakes during his tenure, the management rewarded Blair with a full-time reporting gig. In 2003, Blair famously plagiarized a story about the family of a soldier missing in Iraq. He also frequently invented quotes and faked reporting from other cities while sitting in his Brooklyn apartment. He resigned in 2003. Jeffrey Garofano: Garofano, then a senior at Middlebury College, began interning for Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., during the summer of 2010. Garofano waited a week until he committed the egregious error that would lead to his immediate dismissal: The 22-year-old told someone who wanted to talk to Bennet that she could get a one-on-one meeting in exchange for a $2,400 campaign donation.

12	12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/01/there_will_be_guns.html	"Arizona's Legislature began its new session Monday, guns in tow. At a rally outside of the state Capitol, a 73-year-old Tea Party activist named Arthur Olivas Jr. was photographed wearing a holstered pistol. Anyone who blamed the Tea Party for the slaughter outside a Tucson Safeway, he said, didn't understand the movement and didn't understand gun rights. ""If you see 20 guns out there,"" Olivas told Politico, ""you would not be stupid enough to hold up a bank or shoot anyone because you would have guns pointed at you."" Olivas had company inside the Capitol. The 2010 election saw Arizona Republicans build on the gains they made in 2008, winning a two-thirds majority in the House and holding a 21-9 seat margin in the Senate. In their last session, those Republicans had passed gun-rights laws that had been vetoed for years until President Obama plucked Janet Napolitano out of the governor's mansion; she was replaced by Republican Jan Brewer. This year's session promised to be even better: Incoming Senate Majority Leader Russell Pearce has called himself the ""Tea Party Senate president-elect."" The Tea Party Senate is off to a solid start. On day one, Sen. Jack Harper was moving H.B. 2001, legislation that would allow community college faculty members to carry concealed weapons on campus. It makes sense. Pima Community College Professor Benjamin McGahee had been telling reporters that he'd ""always turn back quickly"" from the whiteboard when he taught alleged Tucson shooter Jared Lee Loughner, fretting over whether his student had a gun. And while he hasn't introduced it yet, Harper has talked about filing legislation to let students carry concealed weapons, too, and has talked up his chances of success. ""A couple of 'country club Republicans' who were opposed,"" he said in December, ""will not return."" It's a bold new Senate. Harper wasn't available to talk today,  although he did get into a tete-a-tete with Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik over who deserved the blame for the Tucson rampage. Staff with Pima Community College Campus Police's would only say that they, like the campus police of Arizona's state universities, opposed H.B. 2001. That might not matter. In Washington, for the first time in years, reporters are paying attention to a gun-control campaign. This week, two Democrats will introduce legislation that would ban high-capacity magazines, like the kind allegedly used in Tucson by Loughner. But Democrats haven't passed gun-control legislation at the federal level since 1993, and even a sponsor of the bill, Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, is cautious about its chances. ""We're in virgin territory here in regard to a member of Congress being gunned down,"" said Chad Ramsey, the federal legislation director of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, where he's worked for 10 lean years. ""You react differently when you know somebody who's been shot. I'm not sure how people are going to react."" That's just the sort of talk that sets off Arizona gun-rights groups. ""Usually the anti-freedom bigots have got something on the shelf just waiting for some blood to dance in,"" said Chad Heller, a co-founder of the Arizona Citizens Defense League, when asked about the federal legislation. In Arizona, gun-rights groups don't have to worry about the ""anti-freedom bigots"" at all. Harper and Pearce are right; they began this year with the votes to expand gun rights, picking up right where they left off last year. They passed a ""Constitutional Carry Act"" that expanded the right to carry weapons in public--the right Arthur Olivas was enjoying today--and limited what local authorities can do to regulate firearms. They made Arizona the sixth state to pass a ""Firearms Freedom Act,"" exempting any firearms made and used in the state from federal regulations. The point of all this is that there's very little gun-control activists can do in Arizona in the aftermath of the Tucson shooting. They can point out that Loughner had shown signs of mental problems before he was sold a Glock 19 at the Tucson Sportsman's Warehouse, or bullets at a local Wal-Mart. But the state prohibits any coordination of mental health records with the National Instant Criminal Background Check system. So Arizona's response--the most likely legislative response--is going to be expanded gun rights. Heller told me on Monday that the Arizona Citizens Defense League has drafted legislation that would allow the state to train members of Congress and their staffs in firearms, and give them access to firearms they could carry in their districts. ""I don't think having a firearm on her would have done Congresswoman Giffords any good,"" Heller admitted. ""However, if it was known that members of her staff were well armed, that very well could have dissuaded [the shooter]."" I couldn't find a legislator on Monday who was interesting in bringing this up, and Heller's group is still working out the details of its proposal. But these ideas are going to have traction. Over the weekend, Reps. Jason Chaffetz and Heath Shuler said that they intended to keep sidearms with them when they traveled their districts. They were going only a little farther than Giffords herself has gone, talking about her own firearm and her belief in the Second Amendment. In 2009, an activist brought an AR-15 to a protest outside of a presidential appearance in Phoenix. It was legal, and Giffords did not condemn it. Her spokeswoman said at the time that Giffords would ""balance rights guaranteed under the Second Amendment and providing her constituents with a safe forum to share their views."" It's been 43 years since a member of Congress was assassinated on American soil. The death of Robert F. Kennedy led to the passage of a sweeping Gun Control Act. The Tucson shooting is likely to lead to Arizona's loose gun-control laws getting even looser--looser than they were when they applied to Wyatt Earp. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/01/the_paucity_of_hope.html	"Who will be the Daniel Hernandez of this political moment? In the chaos that followed the shots outside an Arizona supermarket on Saturday, the young intern calmly sought out his boss and held her upright, pressing her wound and probably saving the life of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. The political conversation could use that combination of wisdom and action. So far, the voices have been defensive, accusatory or noncommittal. The first two are unhelpful and the third is ineffective. This tragedy has prompted not reflection but just another round of sparring. Some liberals quick to point the finger are linking 22-year-old shooter Jared Loughner to the Tea Party--showing the same lack of restraint and tendency to demonize their ideological opponents that they accuse the right of having. Some conservatives, meanwhile, were more concerned with the political consequences of this tragedy than with the possible impact of their rhetoric. Is this a moment for the president to give a big speech? The suggestion feels old-hat. We turn to the president for everything. Gene Healy's book The Cult of the Presidency starts by poking fun at Mike Huckabee's promise to lead a ""revival of our national soul"" if he becomes president. If that's included in the job description, argues Healey, everything is. More relevant to this moment, perhaps, is the fact that President Obama's status as the nation's top Democrat might make it hard for a lot of people to hear what he says. But Obama has some qualifications that go beyond his office. One of the themes of his campaign was the promise to restore civility and restraint to politics. This weekend's shooting may be waking a lot of people up to how far we have to go on both scores. Obama has been trying to lead in that direction for years now--he wrote a book about the lack of trust that has corroded the public debate and gave a thoughtful speech about the power of restraint in particular with regard to abortion. The speech had something in short supply at the moment: honest self-reflection, including the admission of partial fault. In the first hours of news after the shooting, there was no evidence of a connection between Loughner and the ideology of the right, but the accusations came anyway. Voices on the left started arguing the right was to blame for using the imagery of guns and war in relation to politics. Rep. Raul Grijalva, a fellow Arizona Democrat, blamed Palin. On Facebook this weekend the No. 1 question users are asking is: ""Is Sarah Palin to blame?"" Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik, an elected Democrat, held a news conference Saturday and validated this view when he blamed the anti-government rhetoric for the shooting. Conservatives were fighting back. Tea Party Nation founder Judson Phillips sent an e-mail that read,""In a moment, a leftist lunatic destroyed a half a dozen lives."" Other conservatives started passing around a commercial in which Democrats used crosshair images and Obama's quote that Democrats will bring a gun to a knife fight. Sarah Palin's camp rushed to defend her use of crosshair symbols on a map targeting congressional districts, which included the one Giffords represented. ""We never ever, ever intended it to be gun sights,"" said Palin spokeswoman Rebecca Mansour. The idea that the left and right have both used violent images suggests a false equivalence. A few scattered examples from Democrats can't match the power of gun imagery on the right or the regular use of incendiary language about tyranny and insurrection. Politico's Jonathan Martin pointed out that Palin herself  referred to the cross-hairs  on her map as a ""bull's-eye."" But that doesn't mean Glenn Beck or Palin are to blame for this shooting. * Perhaps the saving voice at this moment will come from a conservative who can make this distinction. Politico found a ""senior Republican senator"" who said, ""There is a need for some reflection here--what is too far now?"" What's admirable here is that this senator is willing to broach the idea that heated language on the right can be a problem without validating the idea that it caused the shooting. What's depressing is that this senator would not go on the record. It proves that the political penalty remains high for saying anything--not matter how obvious--that might inflame the armies of no restraint. Any speech now, from the president or a top Republican, would have to go beyond merely saying, ""Tone down the rhetoric."" This doesn't mean that sanitizing political speech is the answer. Passion is inevitable and even necessary. (Besides which, there's no workable way to tamp it down. You can't station a TSA agent at the front of every debate.) Still, thinking first in terms of restraint rather than attack, in crafting a political message or in a political debate, might mean taking a breath before you assume the worst about your opponent's motives. It might mean a pause to consider the danger of your own knee-jerk view of their ideas. Maybe they're actually capable of reasonable thought. In honor of the victims of the shooting, Congress will observe a moment of silence tomorrow afternoon. Fitting but insufficient. What we need is a permanent moment of restraint.

15	15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/01/tea_and_promises.html	"Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., arrived early at the first-ever public meeting of the Senate Tea Party Caucus on Thursday. Dozens of activists had trekked into the grand meeting room of the Hart Senate Office Building just to meet the senators, or to get their signatures on their pocket Constitutions. DeMint moved quickly through the crowd and walked right into Lisa Miller. ""We're really hoping that you'll present enough to balance the budget per annum within this year,"" said Miller, an activist from Alexandria, Va. ""It takes $1.5 trillion, right now, to really start paying down the debt. But given that our spending right now endangers the general welfare, even though it's never happened in the history of our government, we should have the tools under our current Constitution, to preserve the union."" DeMint had never promised to balance the budget immediately. There were reporters watching him, ready to hear a brand-new policy statement. He avoided making one and talked up a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. ""We want an amendment to balance the budget,"" he said, quietly, ""because we're in agreement that we're going to bankrupt the country. ... I don't know if it's next month or next year, but we're not that far."" Miller went right back at him. ""We have a division here in the Tea Party. I don't support any of these constitutional amendments. I believe we have the tools right here, today, in order to preserve our financial strength, as well as our national security."" DeMint kept walking her back. ""The reason a lot of us are supporting a constitutional amendment,"" he said, ""is that they've done things before and made laws like pay-go--you can't pass anything without paying for it. But every time it came up they'd waive it, with 51 votes. It was like a joke. The Social Security lockbox was supposed to keep us from spending Social Security funds. We kept spending them. There's no institutional discipline."" DeMint kept trying to convince her that he--Jim DeMint!--was not a squish. ""If we don't have a requirement to balance the budget, then politics will take it apart. Right now I've introduced $2.5 trillion over 10 years, and listen, the Democrats are just pounding us for wanting to cut essential services. Plus, the thing is, there's no requirement that we have to do anything."" ""Sir,"" said Miller, ""have you ever said no to a teenager?"" DeMint moved quickly to assure her. ""I can say no!"" This conversation went on for 10 minutes; the space around DeMint filled with reporters wagging digital recorders. It left an impression. When DeMint took the podium to introduce the caucus and promise that it wasn't trying to co-opt the movement, he said co-opting would be impossible anyway. ""You can keep on reminding us that what is rational and reasonable here is not rational and reasonable on the outside,"" said DeMint. ""What seems doable here is not enough."" He pointed to Rand Paul of Kentucky, a founder of the Senate Tea Party Caucus along with DeMint and Mike Lee of Utah. Paul had just proposed a package of deep cuts. ""When he suggested cutting $500 billion, they said 'Aw, he's a far right-winger.' But if I walk through this crowd, I'm hearing that cutting $500 billion isn't enough. I'm not right enough!"" That right there is the relationship between the Tea Party and the GOP. There were many questions about whether DeMint's rebels were getting on with the leadership. ""How would you describe the Tea Party caucus's relationship with Republican leaders?"" one reporter asked Paul. Paul just shrugged. ""Good,"" he said. What made this caucus different from all other caucuses? ""No cigars and no closed doors,"" said Paul. ""Open venues. I'm not going to be the leader of the caucus. We're going to rotate around. It's going to be a continued conversation between the grass roots and the people who come from the grass roots."" The first meeting of the caucus was mostly a one-way conversation. Senators and representatives from Tea Party and conservative groups talked; they took only a few questions. When DeMint had to exit, he was halted by Richmond activist John Pettengill, who reminded him that no one had led the group in the Pledge of Allegiance. DeMint returned to the podium and led the pledge. Just about everything else went the audience's way, too. They'd all heard that the Senate had to approve a rise in the debt ceiling to forestall the collapse of America. Not so. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., clued the crowd into a still-obscure bill he'd introduce, the Full Faith and Credit Act. ""It's a simple piece of legislation,"" said Toomey. ""Thirteen lines."" ""Whoa!"" said one voice in the crowd. ""It says that in the event we don't raise the debt ceiling, it instructs the Treasury to make debt service the top priority,"" said Toomey. ""We should take off the table a false argument that failure to raise the debt ceiling immediately results in default."" Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist gave a short history lesson, informing them that the late Sen. Harry Byrd had run an ""anti-appropriations committee"" charged with killing wasteful spending. It was time to bring it back. Paul, for one, was in favor.  ""When I came up here and they asked me what committee I wanted to be on,"" he said, ""I sent Senator Reid and Senator McConnell a letter. I said I wanted to be on the Byrd committee, and I wanted to be the chairman."" All of these things could happen if the grass roots kept showing up and making noise about them. Policy was being moved right, said DeMint, ""because of folks like you standing up and speaking out, because of the conservative media, radio talk shows, blogs, Fox News, who can get out right information."" Nobody in the room disputed this. They'd seen too many of their ideas get adopted, like the pipe-dream earmark ban that became reality, or the brutal death of the 2010 omnibus spending bill. I caught up with Lisa Miller on her way back to work. She thought the meeting had gone brilliantly. ""This is an opportunity to get some sound bites and to get some earned media for the issues that the Tea Party is interested in,"" she said. ""Sometimes it's hard to get earned media. But you guys are here right now!"" Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	Jim DeMint's Tea Party Caucus lets activists drive the GOP further to the right.

16	16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/01/nudge_on_trial.html	"Cass Sunstein arrived early for his inquisition. Walking into the House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing room about 20 minutes before its members did, he doffed his coat, chatted with staff--who politely kept him away from the press--and sat at a table with only a few notes. This was his umpteenth appearance before a congressional committee, but his first since he took over the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs and the GOP took over the House. At 10 a.m., the members of the House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee took their places. This was a bigger deal for them than it was for Sunstein. The Republican members were at war with the administration over EPA regulations, mining regulations, the moratorium on offshore oil drilling, and health care reform. Republicans plan to make 2011 all about regulation and how to roll it back. After winning the House and winning more seats in the Senate, they fretted openly about the end-runs the executive branch could do around them--the EPA using the Clean Air Act, say, as the basis of regulation that supersedes looser environmental laws in the states. And Sunstein's job is to review new rules developed by the executive branch. Target duly painted, the GOP went to work. On Jan. 18, President Obama had issued an executive order commanding agencies to find the ""best, most innovative, and least burdensome tools for achieving regulatory ends."" It was unspecific, but it echoed something Republicans had once suggested for stripping back regulations that, in the parlance of the moment, Killed American Jobs. ""There has been an explosion of regulation and regulations issued in the first years of the Obama administration,"" said Rep. Joe Barton, R-Tex. ""Quite frankly, I didn't see that your organization has done anything to slow this down. I don't see that you've done anything to do what the new executive order says."" ""If I may discuss the idea of explosion,"" said Sunstein. ""The number of regulations issued in the last two years is approximately the same as the number issued in the last two years of the Bush administration."" This was a bit much for Barton. ""Just the regulations issued under the new health care law are in the thousands!"" he said. ""The number that have been issued in the last months are not in the thousands,"" said Sunstein. ""In terms of finalized economically significant rules, I don't think the data supports the claim--"" ""Well, what's the answer to the question?"" snapped Barton. ""Is this new executive order going to require a determination by your group, your agency, of the net job gain or loss of past, current, and new regulations?"" ""We will be focusing very much on job loss as a result of regulation."" ""So the answer is yes?"" ""Well, there are some technical reasons. It's complicated."" ""So the answer is no?"" ""Well, I'm afraid that the answer to this one, uniquely thus far, is neither yes nor no."" ""Well,"" said an exasperated Barton, who had warned the room that he was late for a radio interview, ""that's a very evasive answer. The president is going to give you an A-plus for evading a straight yes-or-no question."" Under Republican presidents, OIRA was a place where regulations went to  die. Between 2,000 and 3,000 regulations were reviewed annually under Ronald Reagan. That was cut to around 500 annual reviews under Bill Clinton, and OIRA has not been quite so muscular since then. But there was no better way for Republicans to start a conversation about this than by grilling Sunstein. His nomination was floated two years ago, in the weeks before Obama was sworn in. It was controversial only to liberals, who worried that the president was grooming a friend (both taught law at the University of Chicago) for the Supreme Court. Unacceptable: Sunstein was an iconoclast who believed in ""libertarian paternalism,"" and in cost-benefit analyses that could, theoretically, scuttle regulation. In the march to confirmation, opposition switched to the other side. It was conservatives who were reading Sunstein's many books--he published two between being nominated and being confirmed--and identified a ""regulatory czar"" who had to be stopped. A typical headline from this period was ""Obama Regulation Czar Advocated Removing People's Organs Without Explicit Consent."" Glenn Beck has, to date, mentioned Sunstein on 99 episodes of his show. The last instance was on Monday, when he credited the OIRA head with ""165 new FDA regulations"" and cried that the author of Nudge had ""called his regulatory czar job his dream job!"" So Sunstein's record looked like a target-rich environment. Republicans struggled to hit the targets. They had a few problems, the chief one being the unflappability of the witness. His dodges were purely logical--if he couldn't promise something, he wouldn't. And a related problem was that the questioners were not always sure what Sunstein controlled. ""When the Department of Interior came out with the moratorium on drilling,"" asked Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., ""did you review that?"" ""No,"" said Sunstein. ""That wasn't a regulatory action within the meaning of Order 12866,"" the executive order that allows Sunstein's office to review draft regulations. Scalise tried again. ""At least it wasn't your feeling that it wasn't?"" ""No,"" said Sunstein. ""It doesn't fit within the definition of a significant regulatory action."" On talk radio, it's assumed that Sunstein's writings on free speech and conspiracy theories have revealed his plans to silence critics. But no one successfully needled Sunstein over the claims and arguments he'd made in his academic work. ""My academic writing isn't relevant to my job,"" he said, after Rep. Phil Gingrey, R-Ga., attempted to nail him down on whether he'd regulate the Internet--a major cause of talk radio and Glenn Beckian panic. ""I'm on the record opposing the fairness doctrine."" Freshman Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., tried to broaden the inquiry. ""What am I supposed to tell my constituents,"" he asked, ""when they come to me and say 'These regulations are costing me jobs?'"" ""There are two sets of concerns,"" said Sunstein. ""One is about fear of what's coming. One is trouble caused by what's there."" ""So they're just fearful?"" ""No, that's not all,"" said Sunstein. ""I'm just using your words. There is a legitimate fear that regulation can be harmful."" Gardner prodded Sunstein to commit, ""in this time of economic crisis,"" not to defend any regulation that cost any job. He demanded a yes-or-no answer. ""A yes answer would be preposterous,"" said Sunstein. ""If there's a regulation that's saving 10,000 lives and costing one job, it's worth it."" This back-and-forth lasted for four hours. There was no question that Sunstein couldn't answer with a koan or an assurance that he was on the same page as his questioner. Subcommittee Chairman Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., attempted to nail Sunstein by asking how many regulations would eventually be created by the health care bill. Sunstein passed. ""One doesn't want to guess about the fact of a matter,"" he said, ""if the fact is easy to find."" It didn't sound as if Sunstein had slipped up, but that was one of the pieces of the hearing Stearns would blast out to reporters hours later. He had found, he argued, that ""rules issued by independent agencies, such as the FCC, CFTC, CPSC, FERC, FTC, SEC, FDIC, the Federal Reserve, the NRC, among others, have apparently been placed beyond the purview of the president's review."" But that was the mop-up. In the room, with Sunstein having done no obvious harm to his mission, Stearns wrapped up the four hours and walked down to the witness stand. Sunstein would come back in three months for another Q and A. ""Thanks for coming,"" he said to Sunstein. ""We've got to get your boss in here."" Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

17	17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/01/comity_tonight.html	"Whatever agenda it was that President Obama planned to describe the evening of Jan. 25 in his State of the Union address--as I write this, the speech has not yet been given--became a lot less important during the hours before the speech as prospects in the Senate for filibuster reform faded away. Earlier this month it seemed likely the Democrats would institute at least a partial filibuster reform. (See ""Return of the Nuclear Option."") A proposal put forth by Sens. Tom Udall, D.-N.M., Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and Tom Harkin, D.-Iowa (text, summary, video) would end filibusters on procedural motions and require senators who filibuster the bill itself to halt Senate proceedings by talking continuously on the Senate floor. That's how filibusters worked in the mythical good old days of Mr. Smith Goes to Washingtonand in the nonmythical bad old days of Senate-thwarted anti-lynching bills. The mere threat of a filibuster could sometimes doom legislation, but to act on that threat, the bill's opponents had to seize the floor and speechify themselves hoarse. This stopped being necessary in 1975 with the adoption of the ""procedural"" filibuster, which ended the filibustering senator's obligation to hold the floor and thereby increased the filibuster's use to the point where the number of cloture votes rose from 27 in 1975-6 to 50 in 1995-6 and then to 91 in 2009-10. Udall never had a prayer of getting the 67 votes required to change Senate rules regarding filibusters under the Senate's Rule 22. But because this is the start of a new Congress, the Democrats were able to use a maneuver called the ""nuclear option"" when Republicans contemplated it in 2005 and since relabeled the ""constitutional option,"" which happens to be its original name. Under the nuclear/constitutional option, Democrats could change Rule 22 itself by simple majority vote, on the theory that the old Congress can't bind the new Congress with its rules. (According to  Yale law professor Akhil Reed Amar and former Sen. Gary Hart, D.-Colo., the majority has the power to change rules by majority vote even when it isn't the start of a new Congress.) All Udall would need was 50 of the 53 Democrats and Democrat-allied independents (Vice-President Joe Biden being available as the 51st vote). Udall's resolution was more than halfway to 50 votes a mere 24 hours after its Jan. 5 introduction. But on Jan. 22, the Washington Post  reported that Senate leaders had turned against it (even though Majority Leader Harry Reid, D.-Nev., who'd opposed filibuster reform in the past, had said as recently as Jan. 6 that he would support filibuster reform). On Jan. 24, the Huffington Post's Sam Stein quoted an unnamed former Senate aide saying ""the votes aren't there"" to use the nuclear/constitutional option. Did the Senate leaders oppose filibuster reform because the votes weren't there? Or were the votes not there because the Senate leadership lost its nerve and decided to oppose filibuster reform? On the afternoon of Jan. 25, even as Udall, Merkley, and Harkin were pleading their case on the Senate floor (and seeking, unsuccessfully, unanimous consent to bring their rule changes to the floor; Sen. Lamar Alexander, R.-Tenn., blocked them), Democratic and Republican leaders were reportedly backing away from any rule vote at all, and instead gravitating toward adopting, within a day or two, some sort of handshake agreement in which the GOP minority would promise to be more cooperative--for instance, by ending voluntarily all secret holds on legislation. This solution sounds much more in tune with the plan (championed by Udall's cousin, Sen. Mark Udall, D.-Colorado) to make Democrats and Republicans play musical chairs during the State of the Union speech. Cosmetic reduction of partisan conflict appears to be displacing substantive effort to make the Senate an institution that operates according to majority rule. You have to wonder whether Democrats, in the hours leading up to their party leader's State of the Union, had any sincere desire to enact its programs. Become a fan of  Slate on Facebook.

18	18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/01/thanks_for_the_boom.html	"At 9:37 a.m. Monday, the office of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor e-mailed reporters its daily news update, the ""Leader's Ledger."" The third item in the e-mail was a Dow Jones story on new private-sector hiring. Cantor's office gave it this headline: ""THERE ARE THE JOBS: Republicans Prevent Massive Tax Increase, Economy Begins to Improve."" It took 19 minutes for Politico to post that item, an effort to ""claim credit"" for good economic news. It took another hour for the Democratic National Committee to follow up and make sure reporters had seen this stuff. (The Republicans-did-it spin appeared only in e-mail, not in a public online version of the ledger.) At 2 p.m., Cantor began his weekly press conference to explain what the message meant: ""When you look at the tax deal that did occur, and I do think that has begun to at least allay some fears in the minds of small businesses and investors that perhaps things won't get any worse, and maybe we ought to begin to focus again on how we work through some of these problems and create jobs,"" said Cantor. ""I say that because I also think that the tax deal itself is a great example of how the two sides can work together and I'm hoping that we could do so yet again, especially as it deals with the No. 1 priority, which is jobs and the economy."" Was Cantor overselling the GOP's role in the good news? Yes and no. The deal that the White House and Republicans hammered out in the lame-duck Congress is, indeed, partly to thank for new, rosy projections for the economy. That's why, as Republicans pointed out on Monday, the White House has spent weeks taking credit for the thinnest, greenest shoots it could find. ""The tax cut deal is an important reason why economists, including me, have raised their outlook for 2011 growth,"" said Mark Zandi, the chief economist for Moody's Analytics, in an e-mail. ""The deal was a significant surprise, including the temporary payroll tax cut, the extension of emergency UI benefits through the end of the year, and perhaps most underappreciated ... the expensing of all business investment in 2011."" But the sticking point wasn't whether the deal had helped. It was whether Republicans had willed a recovery into existence by preventing tax hikes, and whether the boom couldn't have happened had the midterms gone another way.  That's what seemed to be implied in the Leader's Ledger, and it's literally what Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., had said earlier this month. * If Republicans think that, said former Bush and Reagan administration economist Bruce Bartlett, they are ""full of shit"" about the economy. ""The 'tax cut' enacted in December was not a tax cut at all,"" said Bartlett. It was ""merely the extension of tax cuts enacted in the early 2000s that were in effect all during the time the economy was shedding jobs by the millions. And even if there were some miracle properties in just extending tax cuts already in effect, it is grossly implausible to claim that this would have any impact on jobs so quickly."" But politics is the art of the grossly implausible. Ideally, the economy is going to grow this year. If the projections are right, this is the year that unemployment will fall below 9 percent as GDP grows at better than 3 percent. Republicans are going to want to take credit for that. So are Democrats. The rule that governs this is: Take as much credit as you can without getting laughed out of the room. Here's how that worked during last week's debate on the repeal of the Affordable Care Act: Republicans referred to it as a ""job-killing"" law, basing that on the sacrifices employers were saying they'd make when the law went into effect. Democrats were armed with a chart--a calculation that 1.1 million jobs had been added to the economy since the passage of ""Obamacare."" How, asked Democrats (led by Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J.), could Republicans say the bill was job-killing when jobs were being not-killed all over the country? Republicans didn't even attack the connection. They invented one of their own. Rep. Phil Gingrey, R-Ga., rebutting Pallone and others, said that nearly 7 million people had lost jobs since the Democrats took over Congress. It wasn't the first time that data had been used. In October, then-RNC Chairman Michael Steele calculated that ""since Democrats took over Congress in 2006, America has lost 6,851,000 jobs."" When Newt Gingrich and Dennis Hastert's Republicans ran the place, there were 22,404,000 new jobs. Thus, Republicans create jobs and Democrats destroy them. (A few months after this, Steele lost his job. But that was largely coincidental.) There is a grand tradition of this stuff. In early 2009, for example, when the Dow was plummeting to an eight-year low, Sean Hannity started giving Obama the blame for market moves from ""May 6, when it was apparent he was probably going to be the Democratic nominee."" After stocks recovered in 2010, the focus was back on jobless numbers. To prove that Democrats were responsible for them, Hannity and others would start the clock when Nancy Pelosi became speaker, or when Obama became the Democratic nominee, or when Obama was sworn in, or when the stimulus passed. But is this actually how economic policy works? Do markets and businesses respond immediately, in days or even months, to new policies or new majorities? When the question was put to William Gale, the co-director of the Tax Policy Center, he sighed. ""The economy is in a recovery,"" said Gale. ""You're seeing a slow but otherwise not exceptional recovery. For years, everything that was good that happened was attributed to Reagan tax cuts, and then it was attributed to the Bush tax cuts. That's just politics. The interpreting of every up blip is more evidence that this tax cut works, or that works, while ignoring every down blip in the economy, is kind of silly."" Yes, there are some policies that are targeted to have specific effects--tax rebates, for example, or unemployment insurance extensions. Their impact can be visible in a few weeks or months. But the effects of the bigger stuff are guesswork, and dating their effects from political events is basically useless. The only upside to all this posturing is that at least there is some good news for the politicians to fight over. Like Slate on  Facebook.

Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., in the closing hour of the debate over the repeal of ""ObamaCare."" ""This is why we were sent here!"" Indeed they were, sort of. By passing the Repeal of the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act of 2011, Republicans fulfilled a promise to the Tea Party and a promise to independents who had joined them in their panic over health-insurance reform. The repeal bill had started as a sparkle in Bachmann's eye the night the health care bill passed. An identical sparkle fluttered in the eye of Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa. Both introduced repeal bills and both were laughed at for months. This week, they watched their leadership pass a repeal bill, which received unanimous Republican support, and dared the Senate to pick it up and pass it. (The Senate won't.) What happened next was, arguably, more important. With the repeal bill stuck in limbo, Republicans immediately introduced legislation to chip away at ObamaCare before it's implemented. One piece of legislation would codify Republican language to prevent taxpayer money from funding abortion. The chairmen of the Energy and Commerce, Judiciary, and Ways and Means committees have started hearings on how to defund sections of the bill and pass their own market-based reforms. On Thursday, Jan. 20, the conservative Republican Study Committee introduced trillions of dollars in proposed cuts that included defunding the implementation of Obama's law.

20	20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/01/o_no_another_bad_washington_novel.html	Why isn't there a great novel about political Washington? The city is full of exciting emotions--ambition, passion, deceit. The architecture is suitable for midnight intrigue and character growth. The city also contains parts of the American story--racial tension and a huge gap between the rich and poor. Yet this week we get  O: A Presidential Novel, written by Anonymous. It is less a book than a marketing exercise. The pitch meeting must have been awful. The Web page will use Obama's ears! We'll post video! Twitter! We'll keep people guessing!  Journalists are denying authorship for fear of being tied to the bad writing. Not since Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction has there been such an awkward striptease. O is a thinly veiled tale of Barack Obama's re-election. That's one kind of Washington book. The other kind has a raised presidential seal on the cover. Inside, characters shout emergency instructions into phones. Both can be good, and both can be very, very bad. Neither is terribly lasting though. My list of Washington novels that are good and that have lasted more than a news cycle is as predictable as it is short. The most recent,  Primary Colors, was written almost 15 years ago. It wasn't just a marketing stunt; it was a clever book that tried to say something about baby boomers, race, and political ambition. My favorite of Gore Vidal's several books about Washington is  Washington, D.C. (He also wrote a great play,  The Best Man, which was made into a movie). His characters ring true--the battling Washington hostesses; the young, deeply ambitious aide; and the bored, trapped wife. Allen Drury's Pulitzer-winning novel  Advise and Consent is a little belabored but captures Washington from my parents' era of a clubby, constantly moving town capable of seizing up when confronted by Communism or homosexuality. The key plot twist is as timely as ever. (Rent the movie, too, if for no other reason than watching Charles Laughton play Sen. Seabright Cooley). My list is obviously limited, in part, perhaps, by having to read so much Washington nonfiction. I'd include  The Gay Place and  All the King's Men, but they're not about Washington. Please help me come up with a better list.

21	21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/01/the_dark_horse.html	"Herman Cain's political career began when he defeated Bill Clinton on live television. If you missed it--and it was 17 years ago--it happened when the president was making one of the last blitzes for his health care reform plan, and was holding town-hall-style meetings to explain how mandating employer-based coverage would work. Cain got a question in. He'd been a turnaround artist at Pillsbury, working with Burger King, and in 1986 he'd been put in command of the failing Godfather's Pizza franchise. He saved it with triage, closing 250 of around 800 restaurants, before leading an investor group that bought the franchise and put him in charge. By the time he met Clinton, he had been elected president of the National Restaurant Association. This explained some of his confidence as he lit into his president. ""On behalf of all of those business owners that are in a situation similar to mine,"" asked Cain, ""my question is, quite simply, if I'm forced to do this what will I tell those people whose jobs I will have to eliminate?"" ""Well, wait a minute,"" said Clinton, attempting a charm offensive. ""Let's ask--let's talk a minute about what you would have to do."" The employer mandate would add only 2 percent to Cain's costs, Clinton argued, and Cain could just charge more for pizza. ""I'm a satisfied customer, I'd keep buying from you."" ""Mr. President,"" said Cain, ""with all due respect, your calculation on what the impact would do, quite honestly, is incorrect."" Conservatives treated the Cain mutiny like a bootleg from a Bob Dylan/George Harrison jam session, passed from fan to fan. Rush Limbaugh played the clip on his short-lived TV show. Cain's senator, Paul Coverdell, called him a ""profile in courage."" Newt Gingrich praised Cain and, after Republicans won Congress in the fall, gave him a slot on a flat-tax study group. That didn't pan out--a representative of fellow panel member Pete DuPont said he ""doesn't remember enough of what they worked on and spoke about to do an interview."" But Jack Kemp made a pilgrimage to Omaha to meet the man who called himself The Hermanator--a name he has now trademarked--and bring him into the Republican Party. ""Here's a black guy,"" Kemp told reporter Ceci Connolly after he was nominated for vice president in 1996, ""who stands up with the voice of Othello, the looks of a football player, the English of Oxfordian quality and the courage of a lion."" No surprise that he stuck with the GOP after treatment like that. He co-chaired the 2000 Steve Forbes campaign, ran for U.S. Senate in Georgia (he came in second to now-Sen. Johnny Isakson, pointing out that, while he got half as many votes, he ""came within two percentage points of getting into a run-off""), and launched a radio talk show and political column. Last week Cain launched a presidential exploratory committee, becoming the first Republican candidate of the 2012 race. He did 15 launch interviews and got the polite coverage afforded to a dark horse. ""Cain didn't seem particularly plugged into the day to day of politics,"" observed Politico's Ben Smith. That's the oddity of the Cain campaign: He's a man out of time. In the 1990s and 2000s, there was no easy way to transition from The Man Who Invented the Hot Slice into politics. In 2011, the Republican electorate wants to hear from anyone who's not a politician. That's what they say, anyway. ""The political landscape has changed dramatically because of the citizens' movement spurred by the Tea Party movement,"" Cain told me in an interview, giving me the elevator pitch for why he couldn't win a GOP Senate primary in 2004 but can win a presidential primary now. ""Based upon me being very active in that citizens movement, talking to dozens and dozens and dozens of Tea Party rallies, events, conferences all over this country, I believe that people have a better attitude for an unconventional candidate--someone who's more of a problem-solver than a politician."" He's right about the Tea Party. When Cain speaks at conservative conferences and Tea Party rallies, he gets bigger crowds than members of Congress, and only slightly smaller crowds than Fox News hosts. He was invited to join the board of Tea Party Patriots, declining in part because he was thinking about this presidential bid, and he was a spokesman for Ginni Thomas' ""Liberty Central."" At the October 2010 Virginia Tea Party Patriots Convention in Richmond, I saw football-jersey-style T-shirts displaying names of those who might run for president this year: Sarah Palin, Mitt Romney, Mike Pence, and Herman Cain. When no other Republican wanted to talk about 2012, Cain would walk into speeches introduced by a heavily produced video, a highlight reel of his other speeches. What sort of speech do they get? What do they get when they tune into Cain's radio show? It's a mash-up of Dale Carnegie-esque leadership talk and conservative talk about the Constitution, the socialism of Barack Obama, and the rest of the Democrats' crimes against the individual. His speech in Richmond was a perfect example. ""The tragedy of life does not lie in not reaching your goals,"" said Cain. ""The tragedy lies in having no goals to reach for."" It could be the case against Marx, or it could be one of those weekend-long conferences on self-actualization. This might be because Cain has spent as much time writing and talking about business skills as he's spent talking about politics. He's penned three books, one of which is a standard political epistle, but two of which-- Leadership Is Common Sense and  Speak As a Leader: Develop the Better Speaker in You--fit snugly on the shelf next to Tony Robbins. Foolish people, he argues, avoid the ""A, B, and C factors"" that drag them down and pivot to ""the D, E, and F factors--the world might appreciate the D, E, and F of something instead of another A, B and C of everything."" When I talked to Cain, he accused the Obama administration of falling in that trap as it fumbled from crisis to crisis. ""He picked the wrong experts!"" said Cain. ""Good grief! The wrong experts!"" In his book on public speaking, written after he'd done years of get-motivated speeches, he analyzed his turnaround at Godfather's in terms that sound exactly like what he, and every other Tea Party star, wants to do to Washington. ""We discovered that what our loyal customers wanted most was a consistent original crust with their choice of ten different toppings made to order,"" he wrote. ""So we eliminated the other crusts and concentrated on original product ... the entire organization was then self-motivated to produce quality consistently, having identified and removed the biggest barrier to do so--too many crusts!"" When I talked to Cain, he put every issue into this framework. Asked about foreign policy, which he doesn't talk about much in speeches, he identified a problem--weakness and slow decision-making--and proposed a solution: gathering up leaders. ""I support the surge in Afghanistan but I would have sent those troops earlier than the president sent them,"" said Cain. ""I don't know, because I'm not privy to all of the intelligence, if we can win in Afghanistan. If we can, then I would have never announced a withdrawal date. And so the first thing that I'd do [if elected] is summon the experts to find out can we win. If the answer is yes, what is it going to take? And I'm not going to broadcast it to our enemies as to when we're going to get out of there."" He restated this, to be clear about how much he saw his job as handing out tasks to smart people. ""If the experts--the generals, the joint chiefs of staff--if they believe we can win, I'm not going to tear up the plan they give me,"" he said. ""I'm going to execute the plan. If we can't win, I want to know what we can do to exit with dignity out of that country."" Cain spent some more time explaining his view of the war on terror--""we're going to be in this war forever"" --and the Iraq War. ""The people of Iraq, they wanted to become a democracy,"" he said. ""If they did not want to become a democracy, I do not think President Bush forced it upon them. Once it was clear that they wanted to become a democracy, President Bush pledged to help them do that. I know enough from the reports that I've read that this is something the Iraqi people wanted."" These are not the issues that got Cain into politics, though. He won that first debate because he was discussing the business he spent his life working with. He eased into electoral politics after mastering public speaking. When Cain doesn't know something, he studies. He trusts the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, the Media Research Center, and research from Americans for Prosperity and Americans for Tax Reform. (He supports replacing the income tax with the national consumption Fair Tax.) Is it enough for a Republican presidential candidate to hit Iowa and South Carolina and New Hampshire--he's been to all of them--conversant in the work of the think tanks? Cain is going to try. He likes to open speeches with a joke at President Obama's expense. He'll recite the opening words of the Declaration of Independence by memory, then he'll point out that he didn't need a teleprompter to do it. He said he had a better grasp on reality than Bill Clinton. Does he have a better grasp of facts than Barack Obama? ""I have been studying this stuff,"" said Cain. ""Now, about the president."" His thinks on this. ""I try to be nice. This president, I don't think, can discuss any of the things that he says in speeches deeper than on the surface. I can go two and three deep on trying to help people understand where we're coming from, because I've been studying these issues for years."" Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/01/beautiful_noise.html	"In Tucson Wednesday night, it sounded like a campaign rally. A memorial service is no place for the cheers and applause. But the noise was perfect. Not because the president's words were powerful, though they were, but because the scene matched this moment of noisy distractions. The solemnity of the event was interrupted in the same way the period after the shooting has been interrupted by the political debate. The president's job was to move past both--to get a message out and through the noise so the country could hear. If it can be done, he did it. The president memorialized the dead and celebrated the heroes. He could have stopped there. He could have decided not to tarnish their memory with politics. He made another decision, using just enough politics and the power of his office to build a memorial to their lives by calling the rest of us to live up to their example. That they are deserving of our good example. That was the message. He used that expression when talking about our children but it was his request of the country. ""What, beyond prayers and expressions of concern, is required of us going forward? How can we honor the fallen? How can we be true to their memory?"" The president did not ask us to put away passion but to act with restraint. It was not a call to stop fighting but to stop fighting dirty. He didn't just issue orders. By holding up the examples of the lives well lived--and worthy of the applause they received--he hoped to draw us to the lesson. The president was a speaker, but he was also a participant. ""They help me believe,"" he said. Later, referring to Christina Taylor Green, he said: ""I want to live up to her expectations. I want our democracy to be as good as Christina imagined it. I want America to be as good as she imagined it."" On the 50th anniversary of John Kennedy's inauguration, the president wisely did not refer back to the famous line from his predecessor. It has been quoted too often. (The text he quoted from, twice, was the Bible.) But the message of the speech was similar: Citizenship demands something of us. In a sense this was a familiar moment: more words from an eloquent president. But it was more than that. Carefully arranged words are an antidote and an example. In a world of quick, loud, and lazy opinions, it's refreshing to have a speech that feels as though it were typeset. There was no shortage of emotion in the speech, but it did not stretch beyond what was required. As any good writer knows, conveying powerful emotions effectively requires restraint. That's a message that also applies to our political debate. More than eloquence, the president also offered an argument, one he has been making for years. Aides say Obama stayed up all night working on the speech. We know that's his way. But the speech wasn't just the product of an all-nighter. It came from someone who thinks about children and the obligations of being a parent, who knows how it feels to be startled by your desperate love for a spouse whom you might have taken for granted in the rush of the day. The president may not be emotional. But you can't write that speech if you're all ice water. What do we want in a president? The office has become so misshapen it's hard to say what it doesn't encompass. Giving speeches isn't the entire job, of course. But if part of the job requirement is someone who reminds us that our public life can reflect our best private selves, then Obama showed that he is up to it. He has been thinking about that idea long before this tragedy called for a speech about it. The test for all of us is to do the same after the applause has died down.

24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/01/palin_fails_the_test.html	"Sarah Palin's name has risen and fallen in concert with the Tucson shooting that injured Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. As Charles Krauthammer argues, she has been unfairly tied to a madman's rampage. Perhaps this is the post-hoc political burden when you traffic in images and talk of guns. Unfair, yes--but then, politics isn't fair. And it's also true that this moment presents an opportunity for Palin. We judge our politicians in part on what they make of unfair circumstances, on how they rise to an occasion. Palin did not do well. Her statement on the shooting and our political discourse, blasted out on all her social media channels, arrived as the national conversation was moving toward the memorial in Tucson. President Obama will spend the bulk if not all of his remarks Wednesday night talking about the lives that were lost and the heroism on that day. Almost lost in the rush to understand the shooter and straighten out our politics is another instinct: to account for loss and honor suffering. The first thing I wanted to send out this morning was a link to a poem, ""Sorting it Out,"" by Philip Booth, which is about loss and the way it comes back long after someone has died. In these kinds of horrible moments, the standard bromides about condolences to the victims and their families, while heartfelt, are insufficient. So we're all looking for something more. We're looking for it not just from politicians, of course, but they've got a shot at providing some real understanding. Palin, who is so expert in capturing the feelings, frustrations and hopes of a certain segment of the population, demonstrated no range. She offered nothing to meet this moment. Her remarks were defensive, illogical, and distracting. Her use of the term blood libel to categorize the attacks against her and other conservatives was the chatter of the social networks in which she communicates. The term--a slur alluding to the idea that Jews feed on the blood of Christians--was, at the very least, a bad word choice. It did not convey her meaning clearly. She confused or alienated anyone she was trying to convince. And if it was meant to address only her base of core supporters, then it was an act of ill-timed agitation. Palin effectively quoted Ronald Reagan arguing that the criminal alone is responsible for the crime. ""Acts of monstrous criminality stand on their own. They begin and end with the criminals who commit them,"" she said. Good. Then she went on to say that ""journalists and pundits should not manufacture a blood libel that serves only to incite the very hatred and violence they purport to condemn."" Bad. You can't argue that words don't create criminals and then argue in the next breath that, actually, yes, they  might. Another potential 2012 presidential candidate showed how to work around a difficult political moment more deftly. Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi, under some criticism for recent comments that seemed to downplay the civil rights struggle, has now called for his state to build a museum dedicated to the movement. This may not help Barbour with this problem--but it is at least an effective way of turning lemons into lemonade. Palin's statement gives her no such benefit. In fact, as a political matter it may even give critics within her own party evidence in the case they want to build against her. They'd never argue that this shooting had anything to do with her (though potential challenger Tim Pawlenty says he never would have used the targeting symbols Palin used). But they would argue, and now can, that when under pressure, she didn't meet her moment--something a candidate and president needs to be able to do.

The shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., and the murder of six people who were attending a meeting with her in Tucson, was one of those events. Within hours of the news, Republicans had announced that the ongoing debate over the Repeal of the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act would stop, to be picked up again in one week. What else changed for Republicans and Tea Partiers that day? For a day or so, they were re-living the period after the original health care law was passed, when threats to members of Congress surged and blame was placed with conservative activists. Once it became clear--or clear-ish--that accused killer Jared Lee Loughner's politics were inscrutable, the Tea Party pushed back, accusing reporters of ""slander,"" and Republicans pushed back, saying it was irresponsible for the press to bring Sarah Palin's trigger-happy rhetoric into the story. Gun rights weren't too high on the Tea Party's 2011 agenda. Sure, a lot of activists showed up to rallies with pro-Second Amendment shirts, and some of them--in open-carry states--even brought guns. But Democrats' memories of their post-Brady Bill defeats in 1994 are so raw that gun rights weren't an election issue when Obama won or when the GOP won the midterms. The GOP's Pledge to America didn't even mention gun rights as something that needed defending. Their defense was assumed. So it came as a surprise when Rep. Peter King R-N.Y., the new chairman of the homeland security committee, announced legislation that would ban firearms within 1,000 yards of federal offices the way they're banned in some places within 1,000 yards of schools. King's bill isn't likely to pass, but one thing no one was expecting this week was a Republican Congress unifying the Tea Party against him. For that reason, the Don't-Tread-on-Meter ticks back down one point, to 13/100. What is the Don't Tread On Meter?It will track the progress (or lack thereof) of the Republican House of Representatives, and the Republican conference in the Senate, in fulfilling the promises they made to Tea Party activists. The meter will hit 100 if and when the GOP does absolutely everything it promised. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	The Don't-Tread-on-Meter: Life after Jared Lee Loughner.

27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/01/loughners_law.html	"The attempted assassination of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords really did rattle Washington. It took an entire day before someone reacted by proposing new, horrible legislation. That someone is Rep. Bob Brady D-Pa., who told CNN Sunday that he'd draft a bill making it a crime to use words or images that looked violent or threatening to public officials. ""You can't put bull's eyes or crosshairs on a United States congressman or a federal official,"" Brady said. ""The rhetoric is just ramped up so negatively, so high, that we have got to shut this down."" The solution: Expand Title 18, Section 871 of the U.S. Code so that more public servants would be protected from written threats. Would it be rude to point out the problem with this? There's no evidence--none--that violent pictures or words inspired the violence in Arizona. In its complaint charging Jared Lee Loughner with murder and attempted assassination, the FBI found a letter confirming Loughner's attendance at a 2007 event with Giffords (he'd told a classmate that he found her to be ""stupid""). That predates, by three years, Sarah Palin's election map of 20 congressional districts ripe for Republican takeover, marked with white and red targets. And Palin's map was the target--if I'm still allowed to say that--of Brady's bill. (""Someone is feeling a little guilty,"" he told CNN, asking us to read ""Palin"" between the lines.) This is Brady's idea, but he's not alone in obsessing over it. In the aftermath of the Tucson shootings, liberals have scoured the Internet for evidence of Republicans talking violently, and conservatives have responded by finding Democratic maps festooned with targets. Time magazine pondered a ""new era of political correctness,"" because both parties were guilty--why, in 2008, candidate Barack Obama even riffed off the never-bring-a-knife-to-a-gunfight line from The Untouchables! I'll go ahead and predict that the New Era of Political Correctness will be shorter-lived than the ""death of irony"" we witnessed after 9/11. Brady's proposed legislation is half unenforceable and half redundant. Threats against public officials are already illegal. A year ago, a Pennsylvania man was arrested because his interminable YouTube rants veered into threats against Eric Cantor, who's now the House majority leader. Loughner didn't make any YouTube threats. Based on what we know from fellow students, he was becoming increasingly odd, asking ""random, weird questions that didn't go together,"" but he never talked about buying a gun. He kept his assassination plan locked in a safe, not posted on Facebook. I can see why Brady wants to pass this bill. I can see why Palin's Web aide, Rebecca Mansour, has tried to convince a doubting world that the targets on Palin's map were actually ""surveying symbols."" This is a political story, and they need a political fix for it. They at least need to do something that feels like a political fix. But there just isn't any fix for this. We are starting to learn what Loughner actually thought about politics. In one of his Web videos, he asked ""What's government if words don't have meaning?"" A friend of Loughner's told the AP on Sunday that the alleged killer ""did not like government officials, how they spoke. Like they were just trying to cover up some conspiracy."" That's political paranoia, which is not the same thing as anger against politicians. We're in a boom period for paranoia right now. One example: After Obama was elected president, there was a run on ammunition, because gun owners worried he would ban weapons and gun sellers fed into the worry. In its May 2009 newsletter, the Arizona Civil Defense League--a gun-rights group that successfully lobbied for the state's open-carry law--listed the possible ways national Democrats could restrict gun rights, illustrating this with an Obama ""Yes We Can"" sticker blotting out the Second Amendment. None of the restrictions they worried about actually happened. If you distrust the government, you've got good instincts. You can also be wildly misled. Conspiracy theories are interesting, and doomsday scenarios are clarifying, and on the Web it's easier than ever to find them. And more and more, if you are worried about one-world government or a North American superhighway, you can hear about them on some of the mainstream media you listen to--and they take on gravitas when they're mixed in with the rest of the stories. If you want the harder stuff, that's easy to get, too. Timothy McVeigh had to hunt for his copy of the Turner Diaries. In five minutes on his parents' computer, a paranoid person could obtain that book; the ""Protocols of the Elders of Zion""; any number of fire-has-never-melted steel documentaries about 9/11; and David Icke's theories about the shapeshifting Lizards who control the world. Loughner's particular brand of paranoia was incoherent. ""I know who's listening: Government Officials, and the People,"" Loughner wrote in one of his YouTube essays. ""Nearly all the people, who don't know this accurate information of a new currency, aren't aware of mind control and brainwash methods. If I have my civil rights, then this message wouldn't have happen[ed]."" But he was using his civil rights to publish a video essay; if government officials heard him, it's because they clicked on it. On Saturday, before we knew much about Loughner, an Arizona Tea Party activist told me the incident had made him think about how he talked. ""Should I talk differently when I describe the Founders and compare what we're facing to what they faced?"" Patrick Beck asked. ""Could somebody imply that I'm calling for a revolution?"" I've thought about that as I read more about Loughner. Beck was thinking about how to calibrate what he said so that the craziest person in the room wouldn't take it the wrong way. This is undoubtedly what Rebecca Mansour wished she'd done when Democrats like Giffords started complaining about the map of targeted seats. And I suppose that's what Bob Brady wants to do, with the force of federal law and prison sentences. But what's the long game? If someone like Jared Loughner wants to develop bizarre ideas about government based on obscure online theories--or based on nothing at all--no amount of civil dialogue will prevent it.
