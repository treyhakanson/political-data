Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio are the most well-briefed, polished, and smooth debaters in the field. Though Donald Trump's loyalists (aka ""a plurality of Republican voters"") are throwing a wrench in the dearly held pundit prophecy of the race winnowing down to Cruz and Rubio exclusively, you see why ... well, why it should come down to Cruz and Rubio exclusively. They're the best at this. Here's a fine display of the two, evenly matched in their skills, discussing national security. Rubio's strategy has been to pin Cruz as unacceptably dovish abroad and lenient in counterterrorism efforts at home, citing his votes for the USA Freedom Act, which modestly reformed surveillance operations, and against the National Defense Authorization Act, which funds the Pentagon. ""Three times he voted against the Defense Authorization Act, which is a bill that funds the troops. It also, by the way, funds the Iron Dome and other important programs,"" Rubio said, neatly tucking in suggestions that Cruz hates both the troops and Israel. ""Marco has continued these attacks, and they know it's not true,"" Cruz responded, explaining that he voted against the NDAA because he ""told voters in Texas that I would oppose the federal government having the authority to detain U.S. citizens permanently with no due process."" That neatly sucked up one of Sen. Rand Paul's more popular arguments. Cruz then pivoted to lumping Rubio in with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama: ""One of the problems with Marco's foreign policy is he has far too often supported Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in undermining governments in the Middle East that have helped radical Islamic terrorists,"" Cruz said. ""We need to focus on killing the bad guys, not getting stuck in Middle Eastern civil wars that don't keep America safe."" Rubio parried neatly, saying to rousing applause that ""if you're an American citizen and you decide to join up with ISIS, we're not going to read you your Miranda rights."" Rubio is generally considered the more moderate candidate, but on military intervention and national security, he is to the right of Cruz. This is one of those frustrating moments where actual policy proposals counteract with the narrative and make for provocative politics between two nimble candidates. Later on their battle spread to another of their major dividing lines: immigration. This is obviously Rubio's greatest vulnerability with the GOP base and the major reason why he's perceived as the more moderate candidate. Rubio has been trying to defang the attacks from Cruz by portraying the Texas senator as a fraud on this issue, arguing that Cruz in the past has kept open ""legal status""--not citizenship--as an option for undocumented immigrants in the country and increasing visas for skilled workers. ""As far as Ted's record, I'm puzzled by his attack on this issue,"" Rubio said. ""You support legalizing people who are in this country illegally and supported a 500 percent increase in the number of H-1B visas and support doubling the number of green cards."" ""I understand that Marco wants to raise confusion,"" Cruz said. ""It is not accurate what he said, that I supported legalization. I led the fight against his legalization and amnesty bill.  There was one commentator that put it this way: For Marco to suggest our record is the same is like suggesting that the fireman and the arsonist have the same plan because they were at the same fire."" Rubio will never be able to cement the impression that Cruz is the real ""amnesty""-lover in the bunch, the one who is really trying to explode the influx of immigrants into the country. But if he can muddy the waters just enough--""raise confusion,"" as Cruz, the pundit, put it--he could take the edge off of what is potentially a fatal knock against Rubio. Now to our other rivals: front-runner Donald Trump and ... what's his name ... the guy who has all the super PAC money and was supposed to wrap this thing up early? Neil Bush? No. Jeb! Poor Jeb. His advisers and everyone keeps telling him to destroy Trump, but he's not constitutionally capable of destroying Trump. At this point, though, Bush has little to lose, so he might as well go after Trump again. ""Donald, you know, is great at the one-liners. But he's a chaos candidate,"" Bush said early on. ""And he'd be a chaos president. He would not be the commander-in-chief we need to keep our country safe."" You could almost see Trump jumping with delight, relishing the opportunity to tease poor Jeb yet again. ""Jeb doesn't really believe I'm unhinged,"" Trump began."	The Most Revealing Exchanges in the Fifth Republican Debate
1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/in_the_gop_debate_candidates_must_be_asked_whether_words_have_consequences.html	"At Tuesday's GOP debate, we need to hear more substance and less bluster from the candidates on national security, the economy, terrorism, the environment (ha!), judicial appointments, gun rights, criminal justice, and other important policy matters, perhaps in these charged days more than ever. But there is one simple question I would like the candidates to consider Tuesday night: Do they believe words have consequences? If so, which words have consequences, and what consequences might they have? It's a simple thought experiment but one that sometimes works best in the abstract or--even better--as applied to other people's words as opposed to one's own. Let's stipulate for our purposes that none of the candidates will be willing to talk about the uptick in attacks on abortion clinics, or black Americans, or immigrants, or mosques, or on Muslim Americans in the past few weeks and months as a result of incendiary words they have spoken. Certainly Donald Trump will deflect responsibility for the Nazi slogans and calls for violence against a protester shouted out at a rally just one day before the debate. But we already know that when Carly Fiorina is asked whether there is any possible connection between her persistent claim that Planned Parenthood sells baby parts for fat wads of cash and Robert Dear shooting up a Planned Parenthood because--as he explained last week, ""The atrocities. That's what they want to seal. The babies"" and ""I am a warrior for the babies""--the answer is no.* Moreover, the answer is always the same, as she explained to Chris Cuomo, who tried to find out whether she saw any connection between her own inflammatory claims about Planned Parenthood and Dear's shooting: ""This is a typical left-wing tactic, of trying to shut down the truth by silencing people. This has happened over and over and over again."" OK, let's say criticism of the incendiary (and provably false) statements we make ourselves is not only off limits but also a silencing tactic. But Fiorina, who cannot connect her own words to the actions of anyone, will say that President Obama incites hate and violence too. Of course nobody is seriously talking about criminalizing this speech or punishing it, so let's not have that conversation here. We all know that the First Amendment protects all sorts of stupid speech and hateful speech and racist speech and speech that creeps right up to the line where incitement happens and gives it a wedgie. This is what we believe. So this needn't be a legal question. It doesn't mean words have no consequences; it merely means we prefer to punish the consequences over the words. But for the party that eschews causation (guns don't kill people; words don't kill people) there remains a question: It's not necessarily that vitriolic speech targeting certain ethnicities leads others to behave violently (although there is certainly some reason to believe it can and sometimes does). The issue is whether that rhetoric causes certain races, ethnicities, or nationalities to be terrified to walk down our streets at night. And whether anyone plans to take responsibility for that Tuesday night. Because it's impossible to link causes and effects, therefore, the one question I would love to ask each of the candidates Tuesday night is whether other candidates' words have consequences. When confronted with her accusations about Planned Parenthood, Carly Fiorina likes to say that her words have no more connection to violent actions than Obama's words, which presumably do. So maybe she should be asked whether Trump's comments about creating databases for American Muslims or denying them entry into the country are fomenting anti-Islamic feelings and acts. Similarly I would love to ask Trump whether Fiorina's words about Planned Parenthood might be leading to the rise of incidents at clinics. I would ask all the candidates if they think it matters when imams preach hate and whether it has consequences when Black Lives Matter protesters talk about white cops. And given how obsessively these candidates like to blame the media, I would also ask them whether words matter when journalists attack each of them. We all love to believe that when we are speaking truth to power it's glorious and important and has no consequences for anyone except freedom. But if you are standing on a stage Tuesday night suggesting that everyone else's speech has dangerous implications and inflames hate and yours does not, well, that really would be interesting. Correction, Dec. 15, 2015: Due to an editing error, this post origically misidentified Robert Dear as Richard Dear. (Return.)"	The GOP Candidates Must Discuss Whether Words Have Consequences
2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/twitter_commentary_about_the_cnn_republican_debate.html	Tuesday night, CNN will air the fifth--yes, fifth--televised Republican presidential debate. There's no theme, but plenty to talk about: the attacks in Paris, multiple mass shootings at home, a landmark climate deal, and more. Mike Huckabee has been demoted to the undercard debate. Chris Christie is back with the big kids. As usual, Donald Trump will be at the center podium, karate-chopping the air and pretending to throw imaginary footballs. To his left, looking utterly continent, will be Ted Cruz, who's emerged as Trump's biggest rival in Iowa. To his right will be Ben Carson, who recently joined Trump in threatening a third-party run if the GOP fails to meet his expectations. Rounding out the pack are John Kasich, Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio, and Rand Paul. And Jeb Bush is still around. With whispers of a brokered GOP convention in the air, pundits and politicos from both sides of the aisle will be watching closely for signs of discord in the party. Below are their live tweets, drawn from a list of top accounts curated by Slate. Those who lean left are on the left; those who lean right are on the right. Enjoy the instant spin!	Here's What Twitter's Smartest Liberals and Conservatives Are Saying About CNN's Debate
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/pretend_trump_carson_and_cruz_were_your_only_choices_for_president.html	"I have a game I like to play with my friends. It's called ""Trump, Carson, or Cruz."" Here are the rules: You have to pick one of these men--Donald Trump, Ben Carson, or Ted Cruz--to be president. You're not picking the Republican nominee. You're picking the president. No, you can't have any of the Democrats, or any of the Republicans you ""could live with."" You have to pick one of these three guys. Whichever one you pick will be president for the next four years. The rules don't stipulate whether Congress will stay in Republican hands after the election. But you ought to assume it will, since, under this scenario, the electorate that showed up voted for Trump, Carson, or Cruz. The only other rule is that you have to explain why you picked your guy, or at least why you didn't pick either of the other two. Over the course of the year, I've played this game with small groups of friends, colleagues, or family. Each time, just about everyone picks Trump. That surprises me. Most of my friends are liberal, and some are outright leftists. But some are moderate, and at least a couple have, at one time or another, voted for a Republican for president. Still, they all pick Trump. Why? In general, they don't think Trump is serious about the crazy stuff he says. They see Cruz as a clever ideologue. They think Carson is a nut job. But Trump? He's a businessman. He cuts deals. He understands that there are other points of view and that to get things done, he'd have to negotiate. There's no crazy campaign promise, no scary position, that he'd refuse to negotiate away. Plus, Trump is a New Yorker. He used to be pro-choice, pro-privacy, and cozy with Democrats. My friends think he probably still is. The redneck shtick he's using in this campaign is phony, they figure. He's a pragmatist. God forbid he should win. But if he did, at least he could be reasoned with. That's the case for Trump. But I don't buy it. I'm not convinced that a cynical opportunist--and I agree, that's what Trump is--is less dangerous than a gentle dogmatist. So I don't pick Trump. I pick Carson. I'd better explain why. Let's start with Trump. He's mean. He picks fights with everyone. He insults people for no reason. Watch his interview a couple of days ago with Fox News Sunday moderator Chris Wallace, in which, out of the blue, Trump dismisses Wallace as a ""politically correct"" wimp and compares him unfavorably with Wallace's father, the late CBS newsman Mike Wallace. Or watch Trump's interview a week ago on Face the Nation, in which he calls the interviewer, Slate's John Dickerson, ""dishonest."" Anybody who knows anything about Wallace or Dickerson knows these charges are bizarre. But they're part of a pattern that runs through everything Trump says, from journalists to Mexicans to Muslims to Megyn Kelly. The pattern is Trump. He's a mean, angry, vicious person. When Trump targets journalists, we can brush off his hateful remarks. But when he goes after Muslims, immigrants, or Seventh-day Adventists, that's a pathology of a different order. There are no visible limits on the cultural buttons Trump would push in order to gain and maintain power. He treats fear and tribalism as just another pair of tools. To sweep America to the brink of fascism, he doesn't need to believe any of the bigotry he espouses. He just needs to be a remorseless expert in manipulating that bigotry. And he is. That's my argument against Trump. Now I need to explain why I pick Carson. My friends dismiss Carson as crazy. Among other things, he has said that 1) he tried to stab a friend when he was younger; 2) ""Joseph built the pyramids to store grain""; 3) ""I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation""; 4) Obamacare is ""the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery""; and 5) ""A lot of people who go into prison straight, and when they come out, they're gay."" Most of these statements are insignificant. The thing about the pyramids is harmless ignorance. It doesn't touch on policy, and it probably wouldn't take more than five minutes to persuade Carson he's mistaken. The line about prison turning people gay does have problematic implications. But again, it's just ignorance, and Carson, unlike Trump, has never shown any interest in exploiting that kind of ignorance. It's better to elect a president who doesn't know things but is willing to learn than to elect a president who knows better and doesn't care. The line about Obamacare is stupid, but it's just over-the-top rhetoric, which is pretty common among people running to be president. It doesn't affect what Carson would do or what the public thinks. The story about Carson trying to stab his friend actually makes me respect him more, because it's obvious that as an adult he has rejected violence and has devoted his career to healing people. Some journalists have accused Carson of making up the story, as though he should be disqualified for not having stabbed anybody. Give me a break. The only thing that really worries me about Carson is that statement about Muslims. He doesn't seem to understand the text or the spirit of the Constitution with regard to religious tests. And if you read his comments carefully, you'll see that he misunderstands Islam: He thinks the only true interpretation of the faith entails placing Islamic law above the laws of the United States. But Carson didn't bring up this issue; it was raised by an interviewer. Unlike Trump, Carson isn't running against Muslims or any other ethnic or religious group. So my bet is that his ignorance about Islam is just as remediable as his ignorance about homosexuality and the pyramids. Carson has a track record of revising elements of his platform as he learns more. That's a feature, not a bug. The case for Carson over Trump, in short, is that when you're choosing a president, character matters more than knowledge. Trump knows that much of what he's saying is false, but he doesn't care. He's a demagogue, and there's no sectarian conflict he wouldn't exploit. Carson is ignorant about many things, but they're all products of having lived in a bubble of right-wing or religious dogma. He has the intelligence to change his mind when presented with contrary information. But what's far more important is that he has the will. He has a good heart. And unlike many of my friends, I also believe he has an open mind. The safe pick, if you share my distrust of Trump and think I'm naive about Carson, is Cruz. Cruz seems to be a demagogue with limits. He pushes the boundaries of the Constitution, but he understands them. When I look at Cruz's record, watch him speak, listen to his words, and stare into his eyes, I see pure calculation. I see a man who believes in nothing but himself. To some liberals, that's a comfort. To me, it's chilling. I'd rather have a president who strives to serve God and others, and who is willing to learn what that means."

4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/young_people_may_vote_for_marco_rubio_over_hillary_clinton.html	"The main thrust of Sen. Marco Rubio's bid for president is also his most visible feature. He's young, he looks young, and he begins and ends almost every speech with a call for change--partisan, ideological, and generational. ""Before us now is the opportunity to author the greatest chapter yet in the amazing story of America. We can't do that by going back to the leaders and ideas of the past,"" he said in his announcement speech in April. ""The time has come to turn the page and allow a new generation of leadership in this country,"" he declared to listeners at the Values Voter Summit in September. It's the right play for this political environment. Democrats need large margins with young voters to win the White House. But they have a candidate, Hillary Clinton, who doesn't energize the young students and professionals who helped Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. As with other groups that lean Democratic, Rubio doesn't have to win young voters. He just can't afford to lose them all. If he manages that, he charts an easier path to the presidency. A new NBC poll reveals just that. The headline number shows the Florida senator with the win: At this moment, if all adults had to choose, Rubio would beat Clinton, 48 percent to 45 percent. And while Clinton has an advantage with blacks and Latinos, she ties Rubio among Americans who are 18 to 34 years old, 45 percent to 45 percent. As Greg Sargent notes for the Washington Post, this comes after a recent poll from Quinnipiac University that shows a narrow race between Rubio and Clinton among young voters, and it comes as Team Clinton fights for support among millennials--and young women in particular--who aren't thrilled with Hillary, even as she vies to be the first female president. All of this analysis comes with the usual caveats: Most Americans, including most voters, aren't following the presidential election, and are choosing--again, in the moment--on feeling and affect. And these polls--like most polls at this stage--aren't predictive. But that doesn't mean they aren't valuable. That Rubio ties Clinton with young voters tells us about the senator's potential strength in a general election, and the secretary's ongoing fight to build enthusiasm for her campaign. It also raises a question: Why, exactly, are young voters attracted to Rubio? There's a reason observers occasionally call Rubio a ""young fogey."" His rhetoric aside, the Florida senator offers policies on issues like same-sex marriage that appeal the most to the oldest and most traditional Americans. Seventy percent of millennials and 59 percent of those in Generation X support marriage for same-sex couples, but on Sunday, Rubio criticized the 5-4 decision that legalized same-sex marriage and promised to ""appoint Supreme Court justices that will interpret the Constitution as originally constructed."" Likewise, in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, he promised to rescind an executive order that prohibits federal contractors from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. On everything from drug policy (he opposes loosening marijuana laws) to the minimum wage, Rubio is out of step with the youngest Americans. So, why the appeal? It's possible that this has less to do with Rubio than it does the composition of the youth vote, and the circumstances of those voters. The young people who will vote in the 2016 election aren't the same ones who voted in 2008 and 2012. Overall, according to the Pew Research Center, millennials lean Democratic. But the youngest millennials are more Republican than their older peers (although still largely Democratic), and that's especially true for white millennials, who are more conservative than their black, Latino, and Asian counterparts. Put differently, the most liberal millennials are those that came of age under President George W. Bush, while the most conservative ones are those that came of political age under President Obama and have faced a sluggish and stagnant economy. Far from embracing Rubio and the Republican Party, these voters may just be skeptical of the Democratic Party's ability to deliver economic growth and opportunity. To this point, the November unemployment rate was 15.3 percent for people aged 18 to 19, and 9.6 percent for people aged 20 to 24. If today's polling snapshot shows anthing, it's that Republicans can capitalize on this economic disadvantage. Of course, there's no doubt that Team Clinton knows this. So as Republicans begin to make an economic pitch to those left out of the Obama recovery, expect Democrats to take a two-pronged approach. First, to tout their economic policies--universal child care, higher minimum wages, and more assistance for college--and to emphasize the distance between the Republican Party and young people on social issues that, for many, are potential deal breakers."	Why Young Voters May Choose Marco Rubio Over Hillary Clinton
5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/ted_cruz_and_donald_trump_s_coming_showdown_the_texas_senator_has_a_smart.html	"Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump appear on the cusp of a more frank and open exchange of views. The two are at the top of the GOP polls, and there are new signs that the armistice that has prevailed between them may give way to something more pointed. Before this period begins, however, we should pause to note that Cruz has thus far managed the Trump relationship with considerable tactical restraint. He has a strategy and has stuck to it. Critics had once claimed he lacked this skill. It's an important one for a president to have. Though Cruz and Trump have not attacked each other, it's obvious that they have criticisms in the drawer and prepared for use. This summer, Trump raised questions about Cruz's Canadian birth and whether he was constitutionally eligible to be president. I asked him about this last week. Would he bring that up again? ""I'll only bring it up if he's a final two,"" said Trump. The New York Times has audio of Cruz speaking at a recent fundraiser about Trump's lack of judgment. ""People are looking for who is prepared to be a commander in chief,"" Cruz said in a portion of his remarks devoted to Trump and Ben Carson. ""Who understands the threats we face? Who am I comfortable having their finger on the button? Now that's a question of strength, but it's also a question of judgment. And I think that is a question that is a challenging question for both of them."" Trump responded on Twitter in his trademark fashion. "".@tedcruz should not make statements behind closed doors to his bosses, he should bring them out into the open--more fun that way!"" Trump tweeted Friday morning. He then added: ""Looks like @tedcruz is getting ready to attack. I am leading by so much he must. I hope so, he will fall like all others. Will be easy!"" Cruz responded not with a knockout but with a nuzzle. ""The Establishment's only hope: Trump & me in a cage match. Sorry to disappoint--@realdonaldtrump is terrific. #DealWithIt"" Cruz is trying to avoid a fight. He doesn't want to alienate Trump's voters, who he thinks will largely come his way eventually. (Polls show there is something to this.) He's also hoping to reframe all inevitable future conflict between the two of them as a gift to the GOP establishment. He's battling Trump to be the anti-establishment tribune, so this is both an attack and a shield. He's not going to give in to the establishment the way the Donald is by getting into a public fight. Should Trump continue to attack Cruz, the senator hopes it will be seen as a gift to the establishment. The strategy is one Cruz articulated in that same fundraiser. ""My approach, much to the frustration of media, is to bear-hug both of them and smother them with love,"" Cruz said. ""I believe that gravity will bring both of those candidates down. I think the lion share of their supporters will come to us."" Cruz will lay down like a lamb to get what's coming to the lion. In sticking to this strategy, Cruz has demonstrated a protracted display of tactical restraint. He has relentlessly embraced Trump and avoided opportunities to attack him. Normally, Cruz is not shy about calling out apostates. He's done it on the Senate floor and at countless conservative gatherings. He's made a career of it. Were he running against Sen. Trump and not Front-Runner With Lots of Money Trump, Cruz, it's not hard to imagine, would be fileting Trump for his shifting positions on issues from taxes to abortion. (He's doing a version of that now to Sen. Marco Rubio.) Cruz also likes to debate, and when he does, he doesn't simply speak to the beauty of his arguments alone. He also dismantles the positions and questions the motivations of his opponents. So this is no small act of restraint. Additionally notable is that Cruz's colleagues said this restraint was the key thing that Cruz lacked in his fight against the Affordable Care Act. He had no strategy, they argued. He was an ideologue whose passions (whether they were for self-elevation or against the bill) propelled him into a foolish fight with no possibility of a successful outcome. ""I didn't go to Harvard or Princeton, but I can count,"" said Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee at the time. The defunding box canyon is a tactic that will fail and weaken our position."" Were Cruz an ideologue compelled to speak out against wrongs of the kind he has identified in the Senate, he would have spoken out already quite a lot about Trump. But Cruz knows the difference between a losing fight where he gains greater glory among the voters he wants, like the Affordable Care Act shutdown fight, and a fight that might threaten his relationship with those very voters. During the Affordable Care Act debate, when Cruz's opponents called for tactical restraint, he framed their position as an ideological weakness. He faces no real risk of one of his opponents making a similar argument against him now. Because making the equivalent argument about Trump that Cruz made about the ACA would mean arguing that tolerating Trump is a betrayal of deeply held conservative beliefs. No candidate is remotely ready to go that far yet. Cruz is demonstrating a skill a president must have: avoiding a confrontation for a larger goal. During political campaigns, there is an obsession with presidential action. The party out of power demands that the president do something in response to everything. But it's often the case that letting a situation develop is the wiser course. That's the course Cruz is on."	The Coming Ted Cruz and Donald Trump Showdown
6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/ted_cruz_s_latest_anti_muslim_rhetoric_is_beyond_shameful.html	"The Republican Party has taken another step in its ongoing campaign against American Muslims. Five years ago, Newt Gingrich, Sarah Palin, and other GOP luminaries led a movement to block construction of a mosque near the site of the 9/11 attacks. Earlier this year, Republican leaders accused President Obama of apologizing for the Crusades. More recently, some of the party's presidential candidates have declared that Muslim refugees--many of whom are victims of religious persecution by Islamic extremists--should be categorically barred from the United States. Initially, to avoid the appearance of bigotry, the 2016 candidates drew distinctions. Donald Trump said there were good Muslims in addition to ""the bad ones."" Sen. Marco Rubio said the problem was ""radical"" Islam, not Islam per se. Sen. Ted Cruz said the enemy was ""radical Islamic terrorism."" These distinctions are now collapsing as the party slides toward bigotry against Muslims writ large. In the wake of the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California, public anxiety is running high, and polls of Republican primary voters show a strong appetite for anti-Muslim policies. So the leading Republican candidates are now attacking President Obama not just for weakness against Islamic terrorism, but for opposing anti-Muslim prejudice. On Sunday night, Obama spoke to the country about the San Bernardino attack. He called it an ""act of terrorism"" motivated by ""a perverted interpretation of Islam"":"	Ted Cruz's Shameful Attempts to Blur the Line Between Muslims and Islamic Extremists
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/nuclear_weapons_plants_are_killing_the_people_who_once_guarded_them_a_center.html	"PORTSMOUTH, Ohio--Paul Brogdon was a security guard at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant during the last stages of the Cold War, protecting stockpiles of bomb-grade uranium from would-be terrorists. Brogdon and the other guards would take their turns in the Blue Goose, an armored box truck used to transport cylinders of highly enriched uranium from Building 326, the final stop in the production chain, to a vault within Building 345, a distance of about a half-mile. They would sit inches from the cylinders, which gave off radiation, and had to stay in the truck until it was unloaded, a process that could take an hour or more. They wore no protective gear apart from their uniforms. Other times, they would be posted just beyond what they cynically called the ""magic tape""--the yellow plastic tape used to demarcate contaminated areas of the plant. Workers inside the tape wore hazmat suits and supplied-air respirators. The guards had no such equipment. ""We were non-people,"" said Brogdon, 71. After retiring, Brogdon and at least eight other former guards developed prostate cancer, which they blame on radiation exposures at Portsmouth. Fifteen years ago, Congress created a compensation program for people like them. But they have not fared well. Brogdon and others who filed claims saw them denied by the U.S. Department of Labor, which has the authority to provide lump-sum payments and cover medical care for ex-employees of the U.S. nuclear weapons complex who fell ill after working in environments where production trumped safety. Many other civilian veterans of the Cold War are similarly demoralized, having failed to navigate a Byzantine program, troubled from the start, that tries to estimate toxic exposures at secrecy-cloaked sites where records often were lost, destroyed, falsified--or simply didn't exist. ""A lot of claimants have no confidence in the records,"" said Malcolm D. Nelson, the Labor Department's ombudsman for the program. It's not that the department never approves claims. Compared with state workers' compensation programs, which have an abysmal record dealing with complex occupational illness, the payout is notable: $12 billion in more than 74,000 cases since 2000. But nearly half the cases over that period have been turned down. The denial rate would be even higher if not for exemptions carved out for certain groups of workers. Brogdon was undone by a dose reconstruction--an attempt by federal health officials to estimate his radiation dose over time. The results of this exercise, overseen by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH, inform a ""probability of causation"" assigned by the Labor Department. If the department decides there is at least a 50 percent chance a claimant's cancer was caused by radiation exposure, the claim is approved. Brogdon never came close to this threshold. Nationwide, almost two-thirds of the cases involving dose reconstruction have been rejected by the Labor Department. For Portsmouth claimants, the denials are particularly objectionable given the plant's history. Dubious recordkeeping practices and erratic radiation monitoring suggest assumptions made by NIOSH for dose reconstructions are way off, they say, leading to unwarranted denial of claims. ""Garbage in, garbage out,"" said David Manuta, who was chief scientist at Portsmouth from 1990 to 2000 and now runs a safety consulting firm. ""If your input variables are lousy, your output will be lousy."" Stuart Hinnefeld, director of NIOSH's Division of Compensation Analysis and Support, said the agency only goes forward with a dose reconstruction if it thinks there's sufficient information to determine the highest possible dose a worker may have received. ""It doesn't give me any pleasure to turn out a dose reconstruction with a [probability of causation] less than 50 percent,"" he said. For claims alleging injuries from chemicals, linking exposure and disease can be particularly daunting. The burden of proof, some physicians and scientists say, is unreasonably high. For instance, the Center for Public Integrity found that when Labor Department officials ask their staff toxicologist to weigh in on causation because the program hadn't already accepted a link, she almost never agrees with the claimant. Officials with the Labor Department's Division of Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation say that both they and NIOSH are following the rules of a program that was never intended to compensate everyone who developed cancer or other diseases. Approvals are higher than initial expectations, they say. ""We have to evaluate the likelihood that this cancer is due to work or not due to work, and ... there [are] always going to be people that are going to get an answer that they don't want to hear,"" said John Vance, the program's policy chief. ""It's the perfect intersection of politics, science, human emotion, and all of that. It's a difficult, difficult situation."" Some members of Congress are unpersuaded. ""Over the years, [the program] has been plagued with delays and bureaucratic hurdles,"" U.S. Sen. Tom Udall, a Democrat from New Mexico, told the center in an emailed statement. The Labor Department frequently updates its rules, ""often adding steps to the process and making it harder to prove a case,"" he wrote. The agency proposed more rule changes just a few weeks ago. ""Too often, workers die waiting for compensation that they never receive,"" Udall wrote. ""Congress didn't intend for the ... process to be so burdensome."" He has repeatedly tried to change the way the program operates. Most of the bills he sponsored or co-sponsored fizzled, but last year Congress required the creation of an advisory board for the chemical-exposure side of the program. It's in ""dire need of increased oversight,"" he wrote. The Labor Department expects to choose board members from a nominee list next year. ""In Harm's Way"" What prompted the compensation program was a scandal decades in the making. At nuclear-weapons sites run by contractors for the U.S. Department of Energy and its predecessors, home to some of the most dangerous substances on Earth, officials routinely risked their employees' health. Workers were exposed ""without their knowledge and consent,"" Congress would later determine, ""driven by fears of adverse publicity, liability, and employee demands for hazardous duty pay."" In February 1989, retired admiral and energy secretary designee James Watkins told a Senate committee that the Energy Department was a ""mess"" and that ""problems relating to safety, health, and the environment have not only been backlogged to intolerable levels but, in effect, hidden from public view until recently. So we are now paying the price."" Joy Stokes and Faye Stubbs, who worked as custodians and held other jobs at the Energy Department's Mound plant near Dayton, Ohio, described episodes they say illustrate a cavalier attitude toward safety. Stokes said she was ordered to clean a laboratory fume hood--which she later learned was ""screaming hot"" with radiation--without respiratory or skin protection. As a truck driver, Stubbs hauled containers of solvents and barrels of radioactive dirt and was similarly unprotected, she said. Both say managers played down their exposures and eventually took away their dosimeters--badges that measure personal radiation doses. ""We were disposable, I guess,"" Stokes said. Both filed unsuccessful compensation claims. More than 600,000 people worked throughout the weapons complex during the Cold War. When sick employees filed for workers' compensation with their state programs, the Energy Department directed its contractors to fight the claims. Millions of taxpayer dollars were spent on that effort. Bit by bit, suppression stopped working. Whistleblowers came forward. The Government Accountability Project and other groups dug into the issue. And elected officials were not happy to hear how the complex had treated the people who made it run. The legislation that launched the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program passed with bipartisan support, but the use of dose reconstruction to make determinations in radiation cases was included over the objections of some House leaders. Cindy Blackston, who served on the staff of the House Judiciary Committee from 1980 to 2007 and closely monitored the program, said the panel expressed concerns during negotiations and ""continually thereafter."" ""This is a program to address the fact that we put these people in harm's way,"" she said. ""Our position was that dose reconstruction and all that was really just a way to keep from paying people."" The program has two ways in. One, dubbed Part B, pays $150,000 for radiation-triggered cancers and two lung diseases. Part E, for toxic-exposure claims, pays workers for wage loss and impairment--up to $250,000--while eligible survivors can receive at least $125,000. Both cover medical costs. Congress, concerned about shoddy recordkeeping and monitoring, did include a method to exempt certain Part B applicants from dose reconstruction. In cases without enough exposure information, groups of workers can be added to the Special Exposure Cohort, their claims automatically accepted if they develop any of 22 cancers. Portsmouth is among the four sites Congress put in that cohort--though that doesn't help the ex-guards with prostate cancer, which is not one of the 22 cancers on the list. Petitions and NIOSH's own efforts have helped expand the special cohort since then. Certain workers at 80 sites are now part of the group, though claimant advocates say the increase hasn't resolved all the problems they're seeing. Problems, in fact, have been the program's frequent companion. Congress had to amend it in 2004 to put the Labor Department in charge of all claims when the Energy Department--then overseeing the toxic-exposure arm--managed to process only 5 percent of its claims over those first four years. Then-Rep. John Hostettler, a Republican from Indiana, held hearings in 2006 after the White House's Office of Management and Budget wrote a memo listing ways to ""contain the growth"" in benefits paid out. The outraged congressman reminded witnesses at one hearing that the government was to blame for putting the workforce at risk: ""Pinching pennies never looked so inappropriate as it does when addressing the plight of these workers."" Congressional frustration was also behind the creation of the advisory board to weigh in on Part E, which unlike the radiation-focused Part B has not had such a panel. ""We've been asking for it for a long, long time,"" said Terrie Barrie, a founding member of the Alliance of Nuclear Worker Advocacy Groups, whose husband worked at the Rocky Flats site in Colorado. ""I'm trusting the Department of Labor to take their recommendations seriously, not just blow them off and say, 'Thank you very much.' "" ""Don't Worry, You Can Eat This Stuff"" The Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant--in Piketon, Ohio, about 25 miles north of the Ohio River city of Portsmouth--was built by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and began operation in 1954. The 3,700-acre site included three process buildings ""comparable in size to three Yankee Stadiums and a football field,"" according to the Energy Department, an AEC successor. The process itself went as follows: Less than 1 percent of naturally occurring uranium contains the U-235 isotope needed to generate power or make bombs. Therefore, it had to be ""enriched."" First at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Kentucky and later at Portsmouth, gaseous uranium hexafluoride was forced through a series of porous membranes to separate molecules containing U-235 from those containing U-238. By the time the product arrived in solid form at Portsmouth, its U-235 content, or assay, was less than 3 percent. When it left Building 326 in cylinders, it was weapons-grade: up to 97 percent assay. The plant, which ceased production in 2001, was operated by a series of contractors: Goodyear Atomic, Martin Marietta, Lockheed Martin, and the United States Enrichment Corporation. In the early 1980s--as tensions escalated between the United States and what was then the Soviet Union--management at Portsmouth sought to professionalize the security force. It hired military veterans with law-enforcement experience and pitted them against the Navy SEALS and the Army's Delta Force in training exercises. Charles ""Chick"" Lawson, who'd been a K-9 officer in the Air Force, was hired in 1984. As Lawson settled into the job, he grew troubled by what he believed to be safety lapses. When the Blue Goose, for example, would leave Building 326 carrying cylinders of highly enriched uranium--carefully spaced to keep them from triggering an uncontrolled chain reaction, known as a criticality accident--""every criticality alarm we passed we set off,"" Lawson said. The alarms would go off again when the truck pulled into Building 345. Managers claimed these were merely equipment malfunctions, Lawson said. His response: ""That's not a malfunction. Something's going on over here."" Several years in, Lawson ran for local safety officer with his union, known at the time as United Plant Guard Workers of America. He won and stayed in the job for a decade, frequently knocking heads with managers. ""When I was hired in '84, they were telling people, 'If there's an outgassing [of radiation], don't worry, you can eat this stuff. Go home and drink a beer and you can pee it out,' "" he said. ""After I became safety officer I began asking a lot of questions."" His queries, combined with a chemical accident that sent a fellow guard, Jeff Walburn, to the hospital for 11 days in 1994, prompted NIOSH visits to the plant in 1996 and 1997. John Cardarelli, who held a master's in health physics--the study of radiation's effects on the human body--led the inquiry. His task was to determine whether exposures to neutron radiation, a byproduct of highly enriched uranium considered more dangerous than other types of ionizing radiation, posed a risk to workers at Portsmouth. Management had deemed such exposures so insignificant that employees weren't required to wear neutron dosimeters during the plant's first 38 years. (They did wear dosimeters that recorded alpha, beta, and gamma radiation.) In his final report, Cardarelli concluded that ""under certain conditions an acute exposure to neutron radiation can occur"" at Portsmouth, creating a potential health hazard. He highlighted a phenomenon the industry called ""slow cookers""--buildups of uranium within the cascade of gas centrifuges used in the enrichment process that gave off excess neutrons. Cardarelli noted that recordkeeping procedures at the plant made it hard to determine just how high historical neutron exposures may have been. Archive tapes containing older dosimetry data were reused, the data overwritten and unrecoverable. Abnormally high radiation doses were dismissed as anomalies and blamed on ""equipment failure."" And doses that couldn't be linked to a particular person were dumped into a computerized account, known as a ""bucket dose"" account, with no follow-up investigation. This practice, combined with questionable assumptions about levels of ""background"" radiation in the plant, ""will eventually lead to an artificially low dose history for the facility,"" Cardarelli wrote. A 41-page Lockheed Martin report unearthed in an unsuccessful lawsuit by Walburn found that some officials at Portsmouth believed the plant's dosimetry database was ""corrupt."" In a statement to the center, the company said it had investigated these and other employee allegations and ""could not substantiate"" them. In an interview, Cardarelli, now a health physicist with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, said he thinks ""the workers have a legitimate concern that the dosimetry itself may not have been an accurate predictor of their total dose. I believe the slow cooker phenomenon is real. I also believe that people, as a result of the slow cooker, were exposed to neutrons at levels we cannot determine."" NIOSH's Hinnefeld said the agency agrees that the highly enriched uranium handled at Portsmouth ""would be, probably, a higher neutron-emitter"" than material handled at other plants. ""We are investigating that issue and it's likely that we will make some change and actually increase the amount of neutron addition that we are putting in these dose reconstructions,"" he said. Lawyer Frank Gerlach has represented more than 900 Labor Department claimants, including some of the former Portsmouth guards. NIOSH, he said, ""relies on known doctored, falsified dosimetry records."" (The agency said it investigated this allegation and concluded that ""some apparent anomalies ... are not evidence of falsification of dose records, or reasons to disregard the radiation monitoring results."") Energy Department records, Gerlach said, indicate the guards were exposed to far less than 1 Roentgen equivalent man, or rem, per year when in fact ""they probably all received 5 to 6 rem per year,"" based on employee records reviewed by Lawson while he was union safety officer. The legal limit for radiation exposure in the workplace is 5 rem per year. Paul Brogdon has had five dose reconstructions. In the first, in 2004, NIOSH noted that the Energy Department showed his ""whole body deep dose of record"" to be a minuscule 0.078 rem over the entire two decades he worked as a guard. NIOSH, trying to give Brogdon the benefit of the doubt, calculated the dose to his prostate at just above 35 rem. His prostate numbers plummeted in subsequent reconstructions; the probability of causation assigned his claim by the Labor Department fell as a result, from 31 percent to 4 percent. ""They might as well go ahead and say, 'He didn't get nothing in 21 years,' "" Brogdon said. He and other ex-guards told the center they often worked 12 hours a day, six days a week in some of the ""hottest"" areas of the plant--on the roof of Building 326, near vent stacks, for example. Labor Department ombudsman Nelson, who shares complaints in an annual report to Congress without taking a position, said he repeatedly hears from former security guards, firefighters, and administrative employees that the compensation program understates their exposures, assuming their responsibilities generally kept them away from hazards. At one plant in Iowa, the program's records suggest that guards had no contact with toxic substances. ""The complaint by the guards is, 'Where did you get that information from? We were the first responders whenever there was an accident, we were the first to go, we were the last to leave,' "" Nelson said. ""The belief by these guards is that [the Labor Department] is imagining that they all sat in a guard shack at the front gate somewhere and didn't move."" The science on the relationship between radiation and prostate cancer is inconclusive. One study, for example, found elevated prostate cancer death rates among employees of Britain's Atomic Energy Authority; another found excess deaths at the Energy Department's Y-12 weapons plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. A National Research Council committee, however, reported that prostate cancer was ""not usually thought to be radiation-induced."" Lifestyle factors such as diet and smoking, as well as family history and race or ethnicity, all can play a role in the development of the disease. NIOSH data show that through Sept. 23, 2015, nearly 97 percent of 4,975 claims nationwide relating to cancers of the ""male genitalia,"" mostly prostate, had been denied by the Labor Department. ""There's a very high likelihood regardless, with no radiation exposure, that a male is going to get prostate cancer, particularly as he ages,"" said Hinnefeld, of NIOSH. To reach a 50 percent probability of causation, a claimant with the disease would have to show he absorbed a higher radiation dose than victims of many other cancers, Hinnefeld said. Gerlach, the lawyer, doesn't dispute the science; rather, he challenges the doses NIOSH has estimated for the ex-guards. ""They never believe what a claimant says,"" he said. Only if prostate cancer spreads to the bone--one of the 22 cancers allowed in the special exposure cohort--does a victim stand to get a claim approved, said Gerlach, who has won several such cases, none involving guards. Calvin Parker, who joined the security force at Portsmouth in 1979, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in August 2011. His Labor Department claim was denied in March. Parker's wife, Lisa, keeps a tally of former guards who died from cancer or other causes; the list includes 33 names--""just the ones we know of""--from a force of around 200 at its peak. She counts nine living victims of prostate cancer, all of whom were diagnosed before age 65 and started at the plant between the mid-1970s and the mid-'80s. Across the general population, about 6 in 10 cases of the disease are diagnosed in men 65 or older, according to the American Cancer Society. ""I don't believe in coincidence,"" said Lisa Parker, who was a guard for part of her 19 years at Portsmouth and received compensation for chronic beryllium disease, a serious lung condition. ""The common denominator was the plant. All of us who worked as guards were exposed to highly enriched uranium."" The prostate-cancer cluster is notable not only for the relative youth of the men at diagnosis but also for the aggressiveness of the disease, Lisa Parker said. Her husband said the level of prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, in his blood doubled within two months of his diagnosis. ""It's usually a very slow-acting cancer,"" he said. Other former colleagues had similar spikes over short periods. So far, however, Calvin Parker has been compensated only for solvent-induced hearing loss. Brogdon, diagnosed with prostate cancer at 59, covets the program's medical coverage more than the $150,000 lump sum he might get if his claim were approved. When his PSA count goes up, he said, he has to take a shot that suppresses his testosterone levels, saps his energy, and causes hot flashes and night sweats--""just like a woman going through the change."" He can't afford treatments that could mitigate such effects. ""If I had that medical card,"" Brogdon said, ""I wouldn't feel like hell all the time."" Roadblock for Claimants Bob Haller spent 28 years as a custodian, laundry worker, and demolition technician at the Mound plant. After developing cerebellar ataxia--a nervous-system disorder that interferes with balance, speech, and other motor behavior--he filed a claim with the Labor Department. He and his doctor blamed the disorder on exposure to the solvent trichloroethylene and other substances used at the plant. But he was turned down multiple times. David Manuta, the Portsmouth scientist-turned-consultant who estimates he has helped several dozen people with their claims, learned the last denial had been based on a report by the agency's toxicologist, Lynette Stokes. Stokes observed that Haller had suffered since childhood from vertigo and a seizure disorder and deemed it ""highly unlikely"" that his condition was work-related. The report was 21/2 pages, including citations. Manuta also discovered that the Labor Department had received only the first two pages of a 47-page submission by Haller's doctor; one of the missing pages cited a worker study tying chronic trichloroethylene exposure to ataxia. The denial was reversed--a rarity in cases involving a negative toxicology opinion, advocates say--in January 2014. The toxicology reports consider exposure-disease links the program doesn't already accept. They aren't designed to be a roadblock, but they effectively are, according to a Center analysis of documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. Of the 113 reports Stokes wrote from 2013 to early October of this year, seven found a causal association between exposure and disease--good news for the claimant. All the rest were thumbs down. Program officials want her to be cautious about declaring that a certain exposure can cause a specific disease. And she is. Stokes wrote that the body of research showing links between cadmium, a human carcinogen, and prostate cancer is not yet sufficient. By contrast, the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires prostate exams for cadmium-exposed male workers over the age of 40 because of the cancer risks the agency saw when setting a rule for the metal in 1992. (The former Portsmouth guards are among those the department considers potentially exposed.) Considering the claim of a liver-cancer patient exposed to arsenic, tetrachloroethylene, and trichloroethylene, all three of which are classified as known or probable human carcinogens, Stokes opined that the evidence any of the substances can target the liver also was too weak. The studies the claimant submitted ""support important hypotheses regarding liver cancer,"" but ""do not establish a causal relationship,"" she wrote. Most strikingly, Stokes declared in 2013 that the evidence that trichloroethylene can cause kidney cancer was not yet strong enough--about two months after the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer, or IARC, came to the opposite conclusion. IARC determined the solvent is carcinogenic to humans, with kidney cancer as a major reason. Stokes, whom Labor Department officials would not make available for an interview, subsequently agreed with IARC. When two such claims crossed her desk later, she cited the group in writing that there is indeed a causal association. But for cancer epidemiologist Dr. David Ozonoff, that raises questions about how much evidence the program requires--and why officials bother reviewing the literature if they're not satisfied until a consensus group such as IARC is absolutely convinced that a substance can cause the disease. Such pronouncements can take many years, if not decades. Before the announcement in October 2012, the last time IARC weighed in on trichloroethylene was 1995. But even then, IARC considered the solvent a probable carcinogen. Ozonoff, a professor at Boston University's School of Public Health whose research has included trichloroethylene and kidney cancer, is familiar with legal burden of proof from years of testifying as an expert witness. IARC's 1995 determination strikes him as perfectly adequate for a compensation program that requires claimants prove their exposure was at least as likely as not a significant factor in causing, aggravating, or contributing to their disease. ""If something is probable,"" he said, ""that's already more likely than not."" Officials with the program disagree. They say the bar must be set higher to accept that a substance can cause a certain disease, at least for the program as a whole. Individual claimants may still prevail if their medical experts make arguments so convincing that they sway the claims examiner or, on appeal, the hearing official. ""You could have 10 studies that all say 'probable'; well, that doesn't mean you have causation established,"" said Vance, the program's policy chief. That's the reason the Labor Department, though not specifically requiring a certain level of IARC classification to accept cancer claims, relies heavily on the group's pronouncements. Those decisions will reflect ""the agreement in the scientific community,"" Vance said. Dr. Karen Mulloy, an associate professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, has written causation opinions for about a dozen claimants. Her impression as an occupational-medicine specialist--one who has examined many former nuclear-weapons employees--is that the program has set ""a higher standard than what Congress had meant."" Advocates say the causation hurdle is typical of burden-of-proof difficulties they see. Chris Hayes, a lawyer in Tennessee who has represented nearly 1,000 claimants, said it's harder to prevail in Part E now than several years ago, a contention echoed by others. He suspects a desire for cost control is at work. ""As time has gone on, they have made some concerted effort to sort of close the spigot, if you will,"" he said. Rachel P. Leiton, the program director, said cost isn't driving decisions. ""My priority is to make sure that we are paying the people that are eligible,"" she said. ""That's my only priority."" Ombudsman Nelson, however, said a directive issued by Leiton a year ago is making claimants anxious. The directive says big safety improvements at Energy Department sites after 1995 make it unlikely that workers ""would have been significantly exposed to any toxic agents."" It suggests that claimants would need to muster ""compelling data to the contrary,"" unless they can show that incidental exposure aggravated or contributed to their illness. Program officials said in a memo explaining the decision that the Energy Department issued an order in 1995 standardizing worker safety and health rules. Agency enforcement actions starting in the late 1980s showed that violations carried risks, the memo added. But the directive's premise may be faulty. In January, for example, the demolition and decommissioning contractor at Portsmouth, Fluor-BWXT, received a violation notice from the Energy Department accusing it of ""improper alteration"" of radiation-protection records. ""Although no individuals received a radiological dose as a result,"" the notice said, Fluor-BWXT managers engaged in ""willful falsification of documents,"" an act that ""posed an elevated risk of unplanned radiological exposures to [Portsmouth] workers and the public."" In an email to the center, Fluor-BWXT spokesman Jeff Wagner wrote that the company paid a $243,750 fine and dismissed technicians and managers who failed to calibrate radiation monitoring equipment and then ""compounded the issue by going back into the records and entering false data that would indicate the equipment was operating within parameters."" Wagner called the acts ""totally unacceptable."" Radiation and chemical exposures remain a worry at the site, where workers are cutting into pipes that in some cases contain hazardous residue. Faye Vlieger's lungs were injured in a 2002 chemical-vapor incident at the Hanford site, a former plutonium production complex in Washington state where cleanup has been underway for 26 years. The Labor Department OK'd her claim in 2009, but under current rules, she's sure she would have a problem: Given her symptoms, her doctor suspected phosgene--a poisonous gas--but she said she could never get an official answer. ""If my claim was going to go through today, it wouldn't be approved,"" said Vlieger, who helps others with their cases. Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson says cleanup workers at Hanford are exposed to noxious fumes and vapors even now. He sued over the matter in September. ""Despite 20 years of study and multiple reports, the federal government has not implemented a lasting solution,"" the attorney general's office said in a statement, ""and workers continue to get sick."" This story was published by the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative news organization in Washington."	The Men and Women Who Guarded America's Nuclear Weapons Are Dying

Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Gov. Chris Christie, or Gov. John Kasich--is able to show signs of breakout power through the early nominating contests, the establishment will have to consider settling. Barring the ever elusive, last-minute ""white knight"" play, in which Mitt Romney is somehow declared the nominee by acclamation at the Republican National Convention, this likely means making a choice between Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz, for whom the anti-establishment atmosphere this cycle has opened unusual amounts of space. The conventional thinking is that Cruz represents the lesser of two evils for the Republican Party. Cruz may be exceptionally foul to their taste, but he is nevertheless a consistent conservative Republican who just happens, for his own cynical, brand-building purposes, to favor doomed procedural tactics. Whatever. Though his Republican colleagues in the Senate dislike him, this isn't the first time they've had to deal with an ambitious junior senator getting in everyone's way to pursue his own ends, and it won't be the last. Perhaps they might even enjoy having him in the White House instead of the well of the Senate. This first requires getting to the White House, though. Again, Trump seems like the worse of two bad bets to make it that far. His reckless lack of discipline and egregious lies, ""braggadocio,"" and racism appeal quite strongly to a slice of the Republican Party, but turn off most everyone else. But there's an argument that Cruz is an even worse bet. He makes little effort to appeal to people who are not conservative activists. The memory of the government shutdown that he instigated in 2013 will be wielded sharply against him. His net favorability, while not embedded quite as deeply as Trump's, is also negative. Vox's Matt Yglesias, explaining why he finds Cruz even less electable than Trump, argues that Trump's ""actual policy positions are generally more moderate than Cruz's, and his support within the GOP primary electorate does not look particularly ideological."" Though ""Trump as nominee would certainly be a risky (and probably disastrous) leap into the unknown,"" Yglesias writes, Cruz ""as nominee would be a leap into something we've actually seen quite clearly before in 1964 and 1972--a factional candidacy by a senator from the fringe of his own party caucus who gets drubbed on Election Day."" It's a reasonable counterintuitive argument that Trump is not the worst imaginable horse for the Republican Party establishment to ride into the general election. But I'm still not sure the party would, or should, buy it. The major point here, as Yglesias concedes, is that Trump's performance as nominee would be ""probably disastrous."" I'd say ""certainly disastrous."" He is the most well-known figure in the Republican field, who has earned plenty of exposure over not just the past six months but over the past 40 years. And he is despised by a nearly 2-to-1 margin. His campaign has brought an ironic twist to the pursuit of the white working class, the demographic that, for many cycles now, has been the subject of much high-stakes tussling between the parties. Trump has laid out a path not just for taking this demographic, but making many of them love you to the point where they get upset if you offer any critique of him. But in winning the white working class, Trump has abandoned just about everyone else. What's also appealing to the establishment about Cruz over Trump is that Cruz can at least be controlled somewhat, whereas Trump cannot be controlled whatsoever. Cruz in a general election would understand his responsibility to the Republican Party--to not go out of his way to humiliate it by speaking off the cuff, thus endangering down-ballot candidates. Trump does not care, in any way, about the Republican Party or the Senate or conservatism or any person or thing other than himself, and the maintenance of his outrageous brand.  There's no indication that he ever would or could control himself when he's representing an organization larger than himself. He is egomaniacal and cares about no party's fortune beyond his own. Each morning would be the dawn of a new, paranoid terror for party officials, just thinking about Trump on the loose as its party standard-bearer. A majority of American voters also aren't going to listen to Trump's slightly more moderate policy positions over Cruz's if the idea of a personality like Trump as head of state scares them into shock. One simple mental exercise when considering electability is: Would you feel at least barely safe with this person running the affairs of state for even a day? A week? Though a couple of Cruz's legislative policy proposals are far to the right of Trump's, you could at least see Cruz sitting in the Oval Office for 24 hours without destroying the world. You can't be as sure with someone as spontaneous as Trump. This is the attack that Cruz, who has a sharp political mind, seems most prepared to level against Trump. The New York Times reported Thursday on comments Cruz made at a private New York City fundraiser. Though Cruz is denying he was criticizing Trump, that doesn't make any sense, since he was explicitly speaking about why he's a stronger candidate than Trump (and Ben Carson, who's fallen out of the picture): ""Who am I comfortable having their finger on the button?"" Cruz said. ""Now that's a question of strength, but it's also a question of judgment. And I think that is a question that is a challenging question for both of them."" Debating whether Trump or Cruz is more electable in the general election is like debating whether Trump or Cruz is more likely to be the MVP in the next Super Bowl. Each is a very poor prospect for separate reasons: One has extremely conservative politics, while the other is a visibly insane person. This is why party leaders are still desperately hoping that Christie, Rubio, Bush, or Kasich can make something happen.* If neither Trump nor Cruz has much chance to win though, then the question becomes: Is there anything useful the party could get out of either of these two? Not with Trump! The only information the party would gather after riding Trump to its third consecutive Electoral College defeat is the simple acknowledgement that it had just wasted a presidential election on Donald Trump. Trump stands for nothing, other than an electoral waste of time. Cruz, though, would be an interesting experiment and offer another useful upside. He would give the conservative movement what they've been craving: an ideological representative of their own atop the ticket, instead of a mushy-middle ""moderate"" like Bob Dole, Sen. John McCain, or Mitt Romney. Cruz's campaign is predicated on the idea that, in such a polarized environment, what matters most is turning out one's own side, and the best way to do that would be to nominate a movement conservative such as himself. I tend to think this is a fiction conservatives tell themselves, errantly conflating their policy preferences with their political punditry. If Cruz is nominated, though, it would put that theory to the test. Is the conservative movement right about this, or not? We'd find out, and then the country can move on.

It's a proposal so nasty, so shortsighted, and so breathtakingly antithetical to the very core of American values that it demands a response and has elicited one from pretty much everyone. Yet that, by every indication, is exactly what the Man Who Will Never Be President wants. He craves attention, and he'll get it however he can, fair or foul--by any means or media necessary. The inevitable snarky Tweets, cable news quick takes, outrageous op-eds, Facebook fistfights, and denunciations in the pages of established daily newspapers will seep together into a great, undifferentiated Narcissus' pool, reflecting back a scowl and a bad comb-over. The evidence suggests there is little, perhaps nothing of substance behind the attention-seeking--no robust campaign infrastructure, no ideologically coherent set of values, and, it's achingly clear by now, no plan for running the country. But for the Man Who Will Never Be President, the ephemeral but deafening media maelstrom is the thing--his Super Bowl, his Moby Dick, his presidency. It is what he truly cares about, in contrast to the messy, tiring, and inevitably compromised business of actually governing. So consider this modest proposal for restoring a modicum of civility to our national discourse: Everyday readers, viewers, and social media users sick of this silliness should stop using his name. Since he's already currently trending on Facebook and Twitter (again), go ahead and get out your last ""Trump"" now. (That's mine.) While you're at it, consider taking the opportunity to thank your Muslim-American friends, colleagues, and neighbors for their grace during this trying time. If you're on social media, give a shoutout to our Muslim-American teachers, nurses, engineers, firefighters, police officers, and National Guard reservists for their service. And then moving forward, when you dash off that Facebook post, email, or tweet about the latest zany pronouncement, call the man behind it anything but his name. It could be Ooompa Loompa, or Bossolini. I'll simply call him the Man Who Will Never Be President. This isn't really about him, of course. What actually pleases the Man Who Will Never Be President is important only insofar as it helps determine how to remove him from the center of our impoverished public dialogue. Each morning, this great and powerful nation awakes to a host of competing priorities, from education, to infrastructure, to ISIS. The issues we collectively seek to elevate help frame our own perception of our country, and they direct the energies of policymakers with sharply limited bandwidth in very specific directions. They also affect how the rest of the world sees America, which remains an exemplar nation that sets the international tone. In my work, I focus on China--particularly the tightly controlled Chinese media landscape, and the way in which American and Chinese media intersect, informing perceptions within and between the world's two most powerful countries and biggest geopolitical rivals. As a China watcher, I can only imagine the glee leaders in Beijing's top leadership must feel every time the United States convulses in yet another media cycle driven by demagoguery and fear. Fortunately, America's national dialogue is no longer in thrall to a few gatekeepers. Modern media is immensely more fragmented and participatory than ever before, driven by social platforms and often governed by the demand signals that they send. What readers and social media users say and do can shape the news cycle in meaningful ways. To some extent, then, we construct our daily reality one like and retweet at a time. That means we can choose a better and more fruitful direction. None of this means that changing perceptions will upend the very troubling reality from which the Man Who Will Never Be President's campaign has sprung. His popularity is, to a large extent, the manifestation of the pain of many Americans scared for the future--not just for their ability to keep themselves and their families safe, but for their chance to get a fair deal in an increasingly unequal economy whose rules seem to be authored in corporate boardrooms. That anxiety is genuine, often rooted in economic reality, and it deserves to be acknowledged. But it would be far better served by a dialogue about real policy solutions, one untethered from a poor spokesman too absorbed in his own image to honor his supporters' needs."	Let's Make America Great Again--and Ignore This Man
11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/frank_gaffney_the_wind_beneath_donald_trump_s_islamophobia.html	"In the past couple of years, the political influence of Frank Gaffney, who the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as ""one of America's most notorious Islamophobes,"" appeared to be on the wane. In 2011, he was banned from the Conservative Political Action Conference after claiming that the Muslim Brotherhood had infiltrated the group organizing the event. The next year, Gaffney, who was advising Michele Bachmann on foreign policy, concocted a theory that the Muslim Brotherhood had penetrated the State Department via Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton's aide. When five members of Congress, including Bachmann, asked for an investigation of the conspiracy, leaders of the Republican Party, including then-House Speaker John Boehner, forcefully rebuked them. (Soon Bachmann would leave Congress, depriving Gaffney of an important political collaborator.) The most recent Republican nominee for president, Mitt Romney, largely refused to countenance Gaffney-style anti-Sharia conspiracy theories. Chris Christie smacked them down as well. Despite the efforts of Gaffney and his allies, ""Islamophobia was the dog that didn't bark in the 2012 election,"" says Matthew Duss, president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace and Slate contributor. ""But the rise of ISIS and all these spectacular, graphic attacks did what they're designed to do, which is to provoke fear and to provoke hysteria and create fertile ground for these kind of wild claims about the Islamic threat."" It has given Gaffney, and the network of anti-Islam groups of which he is a central part, a new level of power and relevance. The most tangible example of that is Donald Trump's call for a ban on Muslim immigration, which he justified by citing figures from Gaffney's think tank, the Center for Security Policy, about the supposed jihadist sympathies of American Muslims. (Gaffney called for a ""moratorium on refugees and Muslim colonization"" in September.) But Trump isn't the only Republican candidate parroting Gaffney's views. Ted Cruz has also been close to Gaffney; both Trump and Cruz spoke at an August rally against Obama's Iran deal that was co-sponsored by Gaffney's group. These relationships work reciprocally. Trump and Cruz may give anti-Islam conspiracy theories new prominence, but the anti-Islam lobby prepared the ground for the rise of both politicians. According to the Center for American Progress, this lobby--which also includes ACT! for America, the Middle East Forum, and Stop Islamization of America, among others--spent $42.6 million between 2001 and 2009 to support the spread of anti-Muslim ideas and rhetoric. ""The efforts of a small cadre of funders and misinformation experts were amplified by an echo chamber of the religious right, conservative media, grassroots organizations, and politicians who sought to introduce a fringe perspective on American Muslims into the public discourse,"" CAP reported. Even as GOP elites sought to marginalize Gaffney and his ilk, the Islamophobes were working to spread their ideas through the conservative grassroots. Christopher Bail, an assistant professor of sociology at Duke and author of the 2014 book, Terrified: How Anti-Muslim Fringe Organizations Became Mainstream, notes that ACT! for America claims to have more than 100 local chapters. ""They are regularly invited to town hall community meetings to lecture about the dangers of Islam."" These groups' activities correspond to growing local anti-Muslim sentiment, over and above the backlash created by 9/11. ""In my book I use big-data analysis to track the number of news stories about mosque controversies in local newspapers,"" Bail tells me. He found that the combination of violent attacks on mosques and political attempts to stop their construction increased almost 800 percent between 2005 and 2012. ""With the surging power of this anti-Muslim narrative in the media, combined with everything ISIS says and does, it's entirely understandable how there can be a sea change in American opinion towards Muslims,"" he says. This sea change helped prime conservative voters for figures like Trump and Cruz. When Trump says darkly that Obama won't call out radical Islamic terrorism because there's ""something going on with him that we don't know about,"" a good part of his audience knows he's alluding to theories, promulgated by Gaffney and others, about Obama's Islamist sympathies. When Cruz says that only Christian refugees from Syria should be allowed in the United States, he's speaking to people who have likely heard about a Muslim plot to use refugee resettlement to wage ""jihad via colonization."" ""People see a very coherent narrative, backed by pseudo-experts and a sophisticated media infrastructure,"" says Bail. Tuesday, Public Policy Polling released the results of a survey of North Carolina voters, summing them up this way: ""Trump's Islamophobia is a central feature of his appeal to his supporters."" It found that Trump's support among the state's Republicans is as high as it's ever been, at 33 percent. Of those supporters, 67 percent want to create a national database of Muslims in America. Only 24 percent think Islam should even be legal in the United States. The poll also had good news for Cruz, finding him the candidate with the most momentum in the state. A majority of his supporters, like Trump's, want to shut down mosques and believe that thousands of Arabs in New Jersey cheered 9/11. It should surprise no one that Cruz has hesitated to condemn Trump's immigration plan. Both men know what their voters believe, and why they believe it.

12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/why_the_gop_is_captive_to_donald_trump_s_supporters.html	"Once again, Donald Trump has taken the subtext of the Republican race for president and made it text. On Monday, his campaign issued a statement: ""[O]ur country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life."" As such, he said, we have to have a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States."" Last month--in the wake of the Paris attacks--Republicans united in opposition to America accepting Syrian refugees. ""The Statue of Liberty says 'bring us your tired and your weary,' "" declared former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. ""It didn't say 'bring us your terrorists and let them come in here and bomb neighborhoods, cafes, and concert halls.' "" Sen. Rand Paul also used the attacks as a justification for refusing refugees. ""I think Paris should wake us up to the fact that we can't just let anyone come to this country,"" he said. Some candidates wanted, specifically, to screen refugees by religion. ""President Obama and Hillary Clinton's idea that we should bring tens of thousands of Syrian Muslim refugees to America--it is nothing less than lunacy,"" said Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. ""On the other hand, Christians who are being targeted for genocide, for persecution, Christians who are being beheaded or crucified, we should be providing safe haven to them."" Just last week, Paul sponsored--and Cruz voted for--an amendment that would bar immigration from more than 30 Muslim countries that have terrorist networks in them. The proximate arguments are over Syrian refugees, a small fraction of the Muslim tourists, students, and workers who come to the United States every year. But the subtext is clear: Republicans are debating whether they want Muslims coming to the country at all. Trump has made that plain and moved the needle from rejecting refugees to rejecting Muslims--including Muslim Americans abroad--writ large. The Republican chairs in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina have denounced Trump's comments, and a few candidates--Jeb Bush and Lindsey Graham in particular--have blasted Trump for his proposal. ""Donald Trump is unhinged. His 'policy' proposals are not serious,"" said Bush on Twitter. ""[Trump] is a race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot,"" said Graham in an interview with CNN. ""You know how you make America great again? Tell Donald Trump to go to hell."" But Trump is just skating to where the puck was going. Nothing here is qualitatively different from what Republicans have been saying for the past month or longer. The question, now, is what happens next? For that, we should look to the two leading, non-Trump candidates in the race: Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. Both criticized Trump's call for a Muslim moratorium but not on moral grounds. ""I disagree with Donald Trump's latest proposal. His habit of making offensive and outlandish statements will not bring Americans together,"" said Rubio on Twitter, treating Trump's rhetoric as a standard campaign controversy and not a direct attack on core American values. Cruz was even milder. ""That's not my policy,"" he told reporters. (Outside of politics, at least one conservative thinker at National Review has endorsed Trump's concept without endorsing Trump himself.) Both Cruz and Rubio are playing a subtle game. They will not back Trump or his idea, but they don't plan to alienate his voters either. They will sit at the divide between the mainstream and far right and hope to benefit if and when Trump leaves the race. Viewed from their perch in the GOP, this makes sense. Trump represents a large and meaningful minority in the Republican Party electorate, but he has few formal ties to the GOP. A full attack from the entire party--an attempt to destroy his stature within the primary race--risks a schism. Trump would leave, his voters would leave, and the Republican Party might face an independent Trump bid for the White House. In other words, a GOP that denounced Trump in unison is one that might easily lose the next election. No one wants to pay that price, and so some Republicans attack Trump, while others stay out of the breach. Even Paul Ryan is doing this dance. In a press conference Tuesday morning, the House speaker came out against Trump. ""Freedom of religion is a fundamental constitutional principle. It's a founding principle of this country,"" Ryan said. ""This is not conservatism. What was proposed yesterday is not what conservatism stands for. More importantly, it's not what this country stands for."" But, when asked about the outcome of the GOP race, Ryan said this: ""I'm going to support whoever the nominee is."" Republican leaders want to eject Trump from the party, but it's not clear they can without tearing the GOP apart. This doesn't just leave Trump with the advantage; it makes him the key figure in the Republican primary. Trump is driving the narrative of the race and the approach of the candidates. Trump is bringing radical ideas to the mainstream of public opinion. Trump is inspiring, encouraging, and empowering the far right in American politics. Trump is seeding the ground for a future movement, centered on his aggressive ultranationalism. Trump isn't locked in to the Republican Party; the Republican Party--and the rest of us--are locked in with him.

13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/president_obama_s_bad_ideas_for_fighting_gun_violence_assault_weapons_and.html	"Democrats running for president have expansive plans for gun control, but they sit at the far edge of the possible. Barring a Democratic Congress in 2017, neither Hillary Clinton nor Martin O'Malley nor Bernie Sanders will be able to turn their ideas into law. Until then, liberals and gun control advocates will have to live with small change on the margins. On Sunday, in a rare address from the Oval Office, President Obama offered two such measures: a new assault weapons ban and a law to block gun ownership for anyone on an official no-fly list. ""Congress should act to make sure no one on a no-fly list is able to buy a gun. What could possibly be the argument for allowing a terrorist suspect to buy a semi-automatic weapon? This is a matter of national security,"" said Obama. ""We also need to make it harder for people to buy powerful assault weapons like the ones that were used in San Bernardino."" Both policies are en vogue with national Democrats and some liberals. Senate Democrats--led by California Sen. Dianne Feinstein--have already pushed (and failed to pass) a bill to prevent anyone on the FBI's terror watchlist from buying a firearm in the United States, while--in an almost unprecedented front-page editorial--the New York Times called for politicians to outlaw ""certain kinds of weapons"" like ""slightly modified combat rifles and certain kinds of ammunition"" for civilian use. Although well-meaning--supporters genuinely want to keep military-style weapons ""off the streets"" and guns out of the hands of suspected threats--both measures are wrongheaded. There's no doubt assault weapons--there's no official definition for the term, which makes identifying them for prohibition difficult, if not impossible--are scary to many Americans, especially with their presence in high-profile shootings like the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, or the theater killings in Aurora, Colorado. But out of 73 mass killers from 1982 to 2015, just 25 used rifles of any kind, including military-style weapons. Most used revolvers, shotguns, and semi-automatic handguns. Which gets to a related point: We might feel safer if we ban ""assault weapons,"" but we won't be safer. Of the 43,000 Americans killed with guns since 2010, just a fraction--3.5 percent--were killed with rifles. The vast majority of gun murder victims are killed with handguns. But a handgun ban isn't on the table, and for good reason--with its opinion in District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court stated an individual right to gun ownership. And under Heller, handguns are weapons in ""common use"" for ""traditionally lawful purposes"" like defending a home. A ban would be unconstitutional. The no-fly list isn't officially unconstitutional (neither is the FBI terrorist watch list), but civil libertarians--and liberals, at least during the Bush administration--think it's constitutionally dubious. They're right. ""The list contains the names of people who the government thinks are a threat to civil aviation--terrorists,"" writes University of Chicago law professor Eric Posner for Slate. ""These people are denied passage. ... Yet the government does not have proof that these people have committed crimes nor, since it can't see into the future, that they will commit crimes."" If you're on these lists, you're presumed guilty until proven innocent, with no due process and little recourse. The list is conceptually flawed, and using it to deny gun ownership is wrong on its face. Add racial and religious profiling to the mix--the people on the list, including Americans, are disproportionately Arab or from Muslim countires--and you have an anti-gun measure with deep disparate impact. Support for near-unlimited gun rights is as close to a litmus test as you get in conservative politics, which makes federal gun control a nonstarter in our era of divided government. But if you support gun control and want something good--and not just ""something""--then this is a blessing. The sooner Democrats abandon ineffectual gun control measures, the sooner they can turn their attention to ideas that would actually limit gun accidents, suicides, and murders. Some of those are in plans presented by Clinton and O'Malley: tougher and more comprehensive background checks; legal liability for gun sellers and manufacturers; tougher penalties for ""bad actor"" dealers that ""knowingly supply straw purchasers and traffickers""; ownership bans for people ""involuntarily committed to outpatient treatment,"" convicted of domestic violence, or subject to emergency restraining orders; required safety standards for gun storage; and mandatory reporting of lost or stolen firearms, facilitated by technological advances. Even if these are hopeless at the federal level, a national Democratic push might inspire lawmakers at the state and local levels to take action and begin to build momentum for when national change is possible. In all of this, however, gun control supporters should keep one fact in mind: The United States is saturated with guns, and barring confiscation or mandatory buybacks, there's no way to end mass shootings. And as a large, pluralistic society with a long and varied tradition of gun ownership, there's little chance of a broad, anti-gun consensus. Sensible, effective regulation is the best bet for action. You can read that as futility, but it's not. It's a recognition of reality and a plea for perspective. We don't have to end mass shootings to make serious progress on gun violence. An America where fewer young men are killed in inner-city shootouts--where fewer women are dead at the hands of abusers and where fewer children lose their lives to accidents--is a victory. We shouldn't let the focus on mass shootings obscure that. Read more of Slate's coverage of the San Bernardino shooting."	President Obama Just Offered Two Bad Ideas to Fight Gun Violence
14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/ted_cruz_is_trying_to_be_a_respectable_donald_trump_that_s_the_gop_s_advice.html	"The Republican Party isn't sure it can beat Donald Trump. Its leaders fear a backlash, donors fear Trump's attacks, and its candidates still trail in the polls. According to the latest CNN survey, 36 percent of registered GOP voters and Republican-leaning independents endorsed Trump for the nomination. His nearest competitor? Texas Sen. Ted Cruz with 16 percent support. Sen. Marco Rubio, the clear establishment choice, trails with just 12 percent. Zoom out from this poll, and the picture looks the same: In the RealClearPolitics average, Trump holds 30.8 percent support, to 17.5 percent for Ben Carson and 13.5 percent for Cruz and Rubio. It's too soon to say that Trump will win or lose, but he clearly could win, and if he does, what will the party do? In a seven-page confidential memo, uncovered by the Washington Post, the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee advises candidates to ""grab onto the best elements of [his] anti-Washington populist agenda."" ""Trump has risen because voters see him as authentic, independent, direct, firm--and believe he can't be bought,"" writes NRSC executive director Ward Baker. ""These are the same character traits our candidates should be advancing in 2016."" Baker advises candidates to walk this line on issues like immigration and trade as well, where Trump has used nativism and xenophobia to propel himself to the top of the polls. ""Trump will continue to advance those messages, but you don't have to go along with his more extreme positioning,"" he writes. ""Instead, you should stake out turf in the same issue zone and offer your own ideas."" Baker is trying to talk around it, but he's encouraging candidates to play with Trump's fire in a nice way. Run against unauthorized immigrants, but don't call them ""rapists""; raise the specter of dangerous black criminals or ""Trojan horse"" refugees, without saying it outright. The race for the Senate is just beginning, but we don't have to search hard to see this advice at work. Just follow Ted Cruz's presidential campaign. Cruz isn't just treating Trump with a light touch--avoiding confrontations and criticism--he's borrowing his basic frame, without the same kind of inflammatory rhetoric. Unlike Trump, Cruz won't endorse bogus crime statistics from a white nationalist Twitter account, but he will warn his listeners that ""the overwhelming majority of violent criminals are Democrats"" and that ""the Democrats know convicted felons tend to vote Democrat."" On the same score, Cruz won't make a blanket attack on all Latino immigrants, but he will come close to that line when he tells conservatives that ""the Democrats are getting more and more open that they are the party of illegal immigration. ... They support amnesty. They support releasing criminal illegal aliens."" And while Cruz hasn't gone the full-Trump on refugees--the Republican polling leader is opposed to all refugees from Syria, full stop--he does support a religious test for accepting any refugees into the country. ""There is no meaningful risk of Christians committing acts of terror. If there were a group of radical Christians pledging to murder anyone who had a different religious view than they, we would have a different national security situation,"" said Cruz last month. Right now, Cruz is the respectable Trump--same basic message, but with real credentials, a strong organization, and an air of seriousness. And if Trump leaves the race, Cruz is poised to earn his supporters and turn them into real fuel in the race for the nomination (judging from the CNN poll, he's already winning Carson supporters to his side). It all adds up to an interesting question: Cruz is despised in the Senate and hated by GOP elites, but compared with Trump, he's almost mainstream. He's acceptable. Put differently, we know Republican elites are terrified of Trump. But are they so terrified that they would take Cruz instead? And if the primaries come, and Cruz is ahead of the pack--or at least ahead of Marco Rubio, whose potential has yet to show in the polls--will the party take Cruz as the best choice in a buffet of bad ones?"

16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/can_ted_cruz_appeal_to_moderate_republicans.html	"When Sen. Ted Cruz is unplugged from the stump--when he's talking to the donor class, not the working one--he sounds a lot more like his pedigree. Or at least that's what's on the grapevine. ""Our little bird says that when addressing Manhattan donors, Cruz strikes a more moderate and inclusive tone on social issues than he does when speaking to Iowa audiences. Some donors say that New York Cruz sounds different than Iowa Cruz,"" writes Mike Allen for Politico. If true, this is obviously a problem for the Texas senator--a GOP analogue to Barack Obama's infamous moment in the 2008 primary, recorded during an ostensibly private fundraiser in San Francisco, when he told listeners how, when ""you go into some of these small towns, and ... the jobs have been gone now for 25 years ... it's not surprising [working-class voters] get bitter; they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them ... as a way to explain their frustrations."" We can talk about Cruz's approach to Big Apple GOP donors as a gaffe, but it's more interesting to look at it as a symbol of his unusual and dynamic place in the Republican presidential primary. Cruz is a smart and talented operator. Of the candidates in the race, he has the best, most organized campaign. He, more than anyone else, matches big donations to massive grassroots fundraising. And he, echoing Obama's insurgent campaign for president, has dedicated his time to cultivating volunteers and local powerbrokers: the kinds of people who can deliver votes when it's time to go to the voting booth. At the same time, Cruz has always had a fatal flaw. Most politicians are opportunists in one way or another (see: Obama, same-sex marriage), but they can hide it. Cruz can't. His ambition is naked and unvarnished, and it comes through in everything from his theatrical ""filibuster"" to his attacks on his Republican Senate colleagues. It's why, even with standard positions for a GOP politician, Cruz was disliked and distrusted by mainstream Republicans. Then came Donald Trump, who promptly dominated the primary with a campaign of nativist anger and contempt for elites. Trump has defined the contest, and still does, with a commanding national lead over his opponents and strong leads in two of the three early states. At least one elite option, Jeb Bush, has failed to overcome Trump, and the other--Sen. Marco Rubio--is failing. The only person to come close is Cruz. When Trump entered the race, the early read was that he would supercede the Texas senator, who was trying to unify downscale and socially conservative Republicans. But the reality is that Cruz, more than anyone else, understood Trump's appeal. Instead of attacking him, he stayed in his slipstream, waiting for Trump (and Ben Carson) to stumble, so he can claim their voters. In the case of Carson, it's working. But something else has happened, too. In the course of running as a respectable Trump, Cruz has become far more palatable to Republican elites. With Cruz in second place, they've taken another look and see an Ivy-educated former Bush official who straddles the establishment and the base with orthodox positions on taxes and spending and grassroots beliefs on abortion, same-sex marriage, and immigration. Not only can he contain Trump, but he's also predictable. And Cruz himself is comfortable on all sides. He knows when to sound a populist note, and he knows when to dial back. He's connected to the conservative establishment--with support from right-wing pillars like the Heritage Foundation--and is tied to the traditional one, too. No, Republican elites may never like Cruz, but if it comes to Cruz versus Trump, they can live with the firebrand at the head of the ticket. For Tuesday night's debate, then, the task for Cruz is simple: Show the audience--and the Republican Party writ large--that he's the only real choice. The only candidate who can handle Trump and carry the GOP standard without fracturing the party. If there's a question, it comes back to everything that held Cruz back before Trump emerged. Cruz is on the far right of the GOP, and his support rests on the most conservative voters in the party. This isn't just a challenge in an eventual general election; it's a challenge in the primary, too. There are still moderate Republicans, and they aren't interested in bomb-throwers and ideologues. Can Cruz, with his right-wing affect, appeal to them too? Or is that an unprotected flank, open to attack from a equally skilled competitor, such as Rubio? And more broadly, what happens to a Republican Party that embraces Cruz? Some elites say that he could save the GOP from Trump's ""existential threat."" But in the same way that Trump has made Cruz acceptable to GOP elites, Cruz has brought Trumpism to the mainstream. Cruz might be the only one who could stop Trump, but that's just another way to say that--like Richard Nixon and George Wallace--Cruz may be the only one who can co-opt him.

17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/donald_trump_upsets_rush_limbaugh_with_ted_cruz_attack.html	"With the Republican debate season entering the home stretch before voting actually begins, all eyes are on Donald Trump and Ted Cruz to see how much they'll go after each other now that they're polling first and second. We can only hope that it's ""a lot,"" because that would be fun. But while Cruz is still acting as if he and Trump are best mates, the friendship of convenience is becoming more of a one-way relationship. Trump, speaking to Fox News Sunday the morning after a Des Moines Register poll showed him trailing Cruz by 10 points among likely Iowa caucus-goers, began lobbing some test missiles in Cruz's direction. ""When you look at the way [Cruz has] dealt with the Senate,"" Trump said, ""where he goes in there, like a, you know, frankly like a little bit of a maniac, you're never going to get things done that way. You can't walk into the Senate and scream and call people liars and not be able to cajole and get along with people."" I agree with everything said here. And as a rule of thumb, my agreeing with something said usually means that a Republican presidential primary candidate has stepped in it. Trump's criticism was rational enough to earn him rebukes from one of his most reliable power centers: right-wing talk radio. ""This is no different than what the Democrat Party would say,"" Rush Limbaugh said on Monday in response to Trump's comments. ""I mean, this is what the Republican establishment would say, for crying out loud ... for somebody running for the Republican nomination who has set himself up as anti-establishment, to join the establishment in that kind of criticism of Cruz, I don't get it."" ""So that just raised a red flag for me,"" he added. Another popular talker, Mark Levin, issued a similar warning to Trump. ""I would encourage these candidates and Donald Trump to come back to us, because I'm not following him or anybody else to the left, I can tell you that right now,"" he said on Monday. ""Mitch McConnell is the maniac, it's McCain who is the maniac, it's Graham who is the maniac, it's not Cruz. ... And it's amazing to me to have to tell Donald Trump this."" It's amazing. One can't help but enjoy the shock they express upon discovering that Trump has no real beliefs and will just say whatever he wants about the whoever's approaching him in the polls. Or maybe the talkers have known this all along but couldn't broach it with their listeners until a figure of impregnable conservative credibility, like Cruz, became the subject of Trump's insults. Talkers adore Trump, or at least they pretend to, since he gets their nativist audiences all het up about the Mexicans and the Muslims and what have you. The more the relatively sane world lambasts Trump, the more common enemies Trump and the right-wing radio universe share: political correctness, the media, and the Republican establishment. When Trump called to ban all Muslims from entering the United States, the media and most prominent Republican figures pounced on him for issuing a viscerally despicable proposal. While Limbaugh said he personally has ""never said anything like"" a ban on Muslim immigration, he joined with Trump to laugh at the freak out. ""I've got the Trump stack of outrage today, it's comical,"" he said. ""But despite it all, they can't take him out. They can't stop covering him, they can't humiliate him, they can't embarrass him, they can't diminish his support. They're powerless, and this has them in a panic."" Limbaugh also backstopped Trump's widely debunked claim that thousands of Muslims in New Jersey cheered as the Twin Towers fell. True or not, disgusting or not (it's not true and is disgusting), Trump had gotten all the right people riled up, and that's good enough to earn a gold star for the day on conservative talk radio. Even when he went after Sen. John McCain's war record, personally and nastily, he could rely on talk radio to fill his cheering section, because right-wing radio listeners don't like McCain or the sort of people who would defend McCain. But now that Trump is pointing out that Cruz has been a troublesome senator who's disliked by all of his colleagues, he's crossed a line. We went through a situation much like this in the 2012 cycle. Newt Gingrich, despite being a consequential former speaker of the House, ran a Trumpian, bilious, bomb-throwing campaign fueled on theatrics. Though Gingrich's policy positions were ideologically scattered, conservative talk radio ate the shtick up because he consistently assaulted the media, the culture of political correctness, and the Republican establishmentarians panicking about his rise. In late 2011, when Gingrich was leading polls by saying all sorts of nonsense and establishment Republican voices openly fretted that he might derail a Mitt Romney nomination, Limbaugh leapt to Gingrich's defense. ""It's like clockwork. It's becoming predictable,"" he began in December 2011. ""No matter where you look in the Republican establishment media today, there looks to be a coordinated attack on Mr. Newt."" But talk radio eventually turned on Newt as well after he went after another of their sacred cows. Gingrich fell behind Romney by the time of the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary and needed to make something happen heading into the South Carolina primary. So, he began assaulting Romney's record at Bain Capital, describing the firm under Romney's leadership as an ""indefensible"" ""vulture capital"" group that ""made money while losing money for workers."" It was easy for Limbaugh to saddle up with Gingrich when a softy ""Republican establishment media"" voice like George Will was going after him. But here Gingrich was attacking the one thing conservatives really liked about Romney's record: his work as a rapacious free-market capitalist! ""He sounds like Elizabeth Warren,"" Limbaugh said on his show. ""You could have read this in an Occupy Wall Street flyer. The left could not improve on this."" Soon thereafter Gingrich backed off the Bain attacks and returned to a more Limbaugh-approved theatric: yelling at debate moderators. That won him South Carolina, though he eventually was buried under Romney campaign dollars. If Trump continues hitting Cruz with these so-called ""Democrat Party"" attack lines, he risks losing the few powerful media voices who have been cheering on his ridiculous campaign. For a smarter way of going after the conservative senator, Trump might take notice of Cruz's recent habit of saying one thing about immigration in public and another to his donors. There are so few exposed areas on Cruz's conservative armor that you'd better hit them when they appear. To misfire on Cruz is to shift your shared fan base in his direction."	Trump Finally Went Too Far for Right-Wing Media (by Sounding Like a Democrat)
18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/bernie_sanders_message_discipline_may_not_be_enough_to_win.html	"Sen. Bernie Sanders needs to win New Hampshire if he wants any shot at the nomination. It neighbors the state he's represented in Congress for two-dozen years and is populated, on the Democratic side, with delightfully ornery white liberals. He's topped polling averages for the state just long enough to solidify the expectation that he must win it. This isn't just me popping off. Take it from Sanders' own New Hampshire director, Julia Barnes. ""I wake up every morning and tell myself that New Hampshire is a must-win,"" Barnes told MSNBC over the weekend. ""No one is going to say that it's not a must-win."" One excellent means of solidifying his New Hampshire chances would be to win, or at the very least, surpass expectations in Iowa. The latest Des Moines Register survey of the Democratic race--conducted by Selzer & Co., considered the gold standard of Iowa polling--finds Hillary Clinton ahead but not insurmountably so, with 48 percent to Sanders' 39. When the Register last polled the state in October, while Vice President Joe Biden was still included in polling surveys, Clinton led 42 to 37 percent. If Clinton blows out Sanders in Iowa, it could tilt New Hampshire in her favor; if Sanders either wins or gives Clinton a righteous scare in Iowa, he could preserve his New Hampshire edge, assuming he still possesses it through January. Let's say Sanders comes from behind to beat Clinton in Iowa and solidly wins New Hampshire. The question, then, is: Will that change anything? Clinton has two firewalls immediately following Iowa and New Hampshire. Her strong support among Latino voters and organized labor positions her well for a win in the Feb. 20, 2016, Nevada caucuses. Her dominant support among black voters, who comprise a majority of South Carolina Democratic voters, has helped her maintain a roughly 50-percentage point lead over Sanders in the state that hosts its primary on Feb. 27. Three days later is Super Tuesday, featuring numerous states in which black voters similarly exercise a major role. Rudimentary calculations would suggest that Sanders still needs to expand his voting base beyond young people and white liberals and into minority voters, who comprise a large and growing part of the Democratic base. Otherwise, even the ideal kickoff of twin victories in Iowa and New Hampshire would be for naught, and Clinton would cruise through the South to the nomination after losing the first two nominating contests--just as her husband did in 1992. And doesn't the Sanders campaign just know it! After a campaign start in which Sanders clashed with Black Lives Matter activists and carved out little room in his messaging for racial justice concerns, Sanders changed his ways. He began talking about racial justice matters on their own terms instead of as a subsidiary to economic justice concerns and released his own racial justice platform. He's stepped out of the national news cycle, to a degree, to focus on introducing himself to black audiences he's never before had to court. During a trip through the South in November, he addressed black churches in South Carolina and then headed to Atlanta, where he met with Bernice King, daughter of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., before hosting a large rally at which he was introduced by rapper Killer Mike. (Video of the introduction went viral, and deservedly so.) Just last week, Sanders toured Baltimore with black pastors to reflect on the murder of Freddie Gray and the riots that ensued. But just as Sanders was getting criticized earlier in the year for sticking to his economic inequality talking points and not addressing racial justice concerns, now he's being questioned for sticking too closely to those talking points and not speaking about, well, whatever the media wants him to talk about. For the moment, that means ISIS and national security threats. At an event in Baltimore last week, Sanders' (unrelated) press secretary, Symone Sanders, kicked up a bit of drama by telling reporters not to ask about ISIS during their scrum with the candidate. ""Don't ask about ISIS today,"" she told them. ""I mean, it's not on topic. If it comes up, and he wants to talk about it, the senator will let you know. But I'd appreciate it if y'all would stay on topic today."" You can understand her point--let's talk about the very important issues on which our Baltimore visit was based, while in Baltimore! But it's also not a good look to dictate to reporters what they can't ask about when they get face time with a candidate. The episode played into a popular perception about Sanders: that he just doesn't like talking about national security or foreign policy. It's always a decent bet in American politics that people will freak out about foreign policy for a hot minute or two but will ultimately vote according to their wallets. But right now, the fear of ISIS following the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino gives an advantage to Clinton, based on her foreign policy experience and fluency on the issues. If Sanders showed more of a willingness to discuss these issues, he could both boost his own credentials and feast more directly on Clinton's questionable record of foreign policy decision-making--and not just on Iraq. One of the most commonly cited traits that political handicappers use to weigh a candidate's viability is ""message discipline."" By that metric alone, Sanders is far and away the best candidate in the field. It's gotten him quite far already, positioning him well in the first two nominating contests of the year. That winning those two contests might get him nowhere else, though, shows the downsides: It prevents him from coming across as an acceptably well-rounded candidate, with wide audiences in each of the party's major constituencies, who can respond ably to changing events."	Does Bernie Sanders Have a Winning Strategy?
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/the_republican_party_fears_donald_trump_more_than_a_convention_floor_fight.html	"Happy Brokered Convention Day! No, no, there will not be any brokered major political party conventions today. I mean that today, thanks to the Washington Post's reporting on what a few fancy Washington people talked about at some fancy dinner the other night, marks the first of many days in which political media overflows with thrilling content about how There really could be a brokered convention this year! This speculation comes around like clockwork each cycle. When it doesn't materialize, it's replaced by its general election equivalent, There really could be an Electoral College tie!, as political reporters' prevailing hope of hopes. ""Republican officials and leading figures in the party's establishment,"" the Post reports, ""are preparing for the possibility of a brokered convention as businessman Donald Trump continues to sit atop the polls in the GOP presidential race."" Figures like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus listened Monday night while officials laid out the nuts and bolts of a contested convention process. And if they ran through a contingency plan two months before anyone's voted, then there's definitely going to be a brokered convention this year, right? Don't hold your breath. There hasn't been a floor fight over the GOP presidential nomination since 1976 or any undecided first-ballot votes for a nominee from either party since 1952. That's because there aren't really any ""brokers"" anymore, i.e., party officials who keep delegates in their pockets and horse-trade at the site. That's a very old-timey, machine-politics system that looks absolutely awful on television. Modern nominating conventions aren't intended to resolve nominating disputes in real time. Instead, they serve as a) well-choreographed PR events for each party to market itself as allegedly representative of the American people, and b) a way for the parties to pamper big donors and attend cheesy, depraved happy hours with evil lobbyists. Because a deadlocked convention, in which a party heads into a convention before a candidate has secured a majority of delegates, would be an unholy PR mess for a party--picture roughly 2,500 delegates, along with the candidates themselves, horse-trading on the floor as his or her own individual broker--the Republican Party will do everything in its power to avoid this outcome. If a top candidate is a wee bit short of a majority of delegates, the powers that be would try to nudge a few unbound delegates in the right direction to push the candidate over the top and avoid a scene. What makes a contested Republican convention slightly more possible this year than in previous cycles is that there is a fresh scenario that would constitute even worse PR for the party than a floor melee: Donald Trump winning the party's presidential nomination. That, per the Washington Post, is what this dinner was really all about. ""Weighing in on that scenario as Priebus and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) listened,"" the Post writes, ""several longtime Republican power brokers argued that if the controversial billionaire storms through the primaries, the party's establishment must lay the groundwork for a floor fight in which the GOP's mainstream wing could coalesce around an alternative, the people said."" If Sen. Marco Rubio or even Sen. Ted Cruz came into the convention with about 45 percent of ""bound"" delegates--ones earned in primaries and required to vote for designated candidates on the first ballot--the party's superdelegates could push him over the edge. But if Trump came in with 49.9 percent of bound delegates, the party would do everything in its power to prevent him from reaching a majority. Such an aggressive effort to block Trump from the nomination, displayed on national TV, would mean calling Trump on his threat to run as an independent and praying that it's a bluff. You never know with Trump. But it's worth pointing out that there would be no point to an independent presidential bid. It would be expensive, he would run into exhausting ballot access issues, he would have a 0 percent chance of winning the general election, and he single-handedly would be responsible for Hillary Clinton's election. An outright bound-delegate majority for, say, Rubio would be ideal for the party. A contested convention in which Cruz is nominated as a compromise, of sorts, between Trump and Rubio would be a nightmare for the party. A Trump independent presidential run would be a worse nightmare. But the absolute worst nightmare for the party would be Trump as its presidential nominee. In that scenario the GOP loses not just the presidential election but total control over the image of its party, as well as a disturbing number of down-ballot races. The entire Republican apparatus, from the local to the state to the federal level, would wake up each morning of a general election season as a member of Trump's party. A contested convention would be disgusting. But if the party has to do it to stop Donald Trump, of course it will be prepared to do so. Read more of Slate's coverage of the GOP primary."	The GOP's Greatest Fears
20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/planning_for_a_brokered_convention_helps_trump_hurts_gop.html	"In their drive to stop Donald Trump--or contain him, at least--Republican leaders have forgotten the only lesson that matters here: Fear is the mind killer. First--out of anxiety that Trump might partake in a third-party run--they tried to bind his hands with a pledge to support the eventual nominee. We'll see if the goal of blocking an independent Trump run actually holds up. In the meantime, the pledge has done more to bind the GOP to Trump than the reverse; even after denouncing his plans as dangerous and authoritarian, key Republican leaders still say they'd support Trump if he wins the nomination. They're stuck to Trump, and they don't know how to escape. Now they're making another panicked move to try to unbind themselves. On Monday, report Robert Costa and Tom Hamburger for the Washington Post, more than 20 GOP officials and ""leading figures in the party's establishment"" met for a dinner held by Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, where they discussed the prospect of a ""brokered convention."" The specific scenario under consideration was one in which Trump were to hold a ""significant number of delegates"" but not enough to win the nomination on the ""first ballot,"" when pledged delegates--people bound to their candidates--place their votes. ""[S]everal longtime Republican power brokers argued that if the controversial billionaire storms through the primaries, the party's establishment must lay the groundwork for a floor fight in which the GOP's mainstream wing could coalesce around an alternative,"" wrote Costa and Hamburger. Likewise, one of the most prominent participants--Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell--acknowledged that ""a deadlocked convention"" was something ""the party should prepare for."" It's worth saying, now, that the potential brokered convention is a perennial story. Each cycle, on either side, someone floats the idea of a floor fight for the nomination. And each cycle, it's a moot point, as the primary ends with an unambiguous winner, whether it was Barack Obama in 2008 or Mitt Romney in 2012. With that said, it's remarkable to see actual Republican leaders hold a serious meeting on the question of a brokered convention, even if it grew out of a regular gathering of party officials. It shows real fear among GOP elites--fear that Trump could win the nomination, and destroy the Republican Party as they know it, or at least cost them the White House for another four years (to say nothing of what ""Trumpism"" might mean for future Republican politicians). At least in the short term, the meeting was a bad move tactically. As mentioned, Republicans leaders don't just have to fear a Trump nomination; their other nightmare is if Trump runs as an independent, taking votes from the Republican nominee and giving the election to the Democrats. If there's anything that might encourage an independent Trump bid--or make one more palatable to his ostensibly Republican supporters--it would be the idea that the party is conspiring against him, undermining its own part of the pledge and empowering him to abandon the party, full stop. Indeed, Trump already seems to be laying groundwork for the idea that a contested convention would be an unfair one to Trump. ""I'll be disadvantaged,"" Trump told the Post last week. ""My disadvantage is that I'd be going up against guys who grew up with each other, who know each other intimately, and I don't know who they are, OK? That's a big disadvantage. ... These kind of guys stay close. They all know each other. They want each other to win."" Republicans accomplish nothing by discussing a brokered convention, and risk a future where Trump decides to cast the GOP aside for his own, third-party campaign. It's a foolish play, born of fear. It's much better to wait. Yes, Trump leads, but that doesn't mean he'll win votes. If Super Tuesday comes, and Trump is still ahead, then it will be time to panic. For now, however, the best bet for Republicans is to watch quietly and hopefully, and continue to back more mainstream candidates for the nomination."

You made it! I'm Josh Voorhees, a senior writer here at Slate magazine. Since we last met, I've shifted my beat ever so slightly. Then, I was writing about public policy. Now, I'm blogging about the 2016 campaign--which means this week I wrote about Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, and Ted Cruz ... and how he is positioning himself in relation to some guy named Donald J. Trump. In a normal week, that's too much Trump, but this week--when the polling front-runner for one of the country's two major parties pushed an unapologetically xenophobic plan that is as disgusting as it dangerous--wasn't a normal week. As I wrote this summer, the Donald doesn't need to win the GOP nomination to matter. He may be a self-aggrandizing Twitter troll in a $5,000 Brioni suit, but he's also the avatar of choice for a significant slice of the American electorate that sees itself in his particular brand of belligerence. That view and those voters won't disappear when Trump does. The press ignores that fact at its own peril--and at the public's own loss. At an online magazine like ours, meanwhile, it's our mission to write about the stories of the moment and to use our audience's interest in them to make larger points, connections, and arguments. And that's what we did. Jamelle Bouie explained why we're all stuck with the blustery billionaire. Will Saletan dove into the polls to show how the Donald is channeling the bigotry of his party's base. John Dickerson pointed out the emptiness of the GOP's condemnation of its own front-runner. Michelle Goldberg took a look at the Isalmophobes who laid the groundwork for Trump's rise. Jeremy Stahl wrote about how the former reality TV host is a boon to white supremacist groups. Joshua Keating explained how terrorism is bringing out the worst in voters all over the world. And Jim Newell made the case for why Cruz really is a better bet than Trump for the GOP establishment. (Jim also found time to give me the pep talk I desperately needed.) Still, I concede the rapid-fire nature of the Trump churn can be a drag. Fortunately, my Slate colleagues don't just do smart, fast analysis; they also produce brilliant, time-intensive works of art. This week's cover story was the perfect example of that: Katy Waldman's ""There Once Was a Girl."" Part memoir, part meditation, part literary analysis, part medical history, Katy's work examines the false narratives around anorexia that we create in literature, in life, and in between. The piece is honest, insightful, important, brave, and oh so wonderfully lyrical that it risks giving writers like myself stage fright. (I could spend an entire book leave trying to craft a single sentence as powerful as Katy's description of her family: ""We're a volatile clan, skilled at setting fires, but scared of them too."") Because you're a Plus subscriber, you can read Gabriel Roth's interview with Katy about what it was like to write such a personal story, and what the chances are her mother never speaks to her again. I can already hear the weekend calling, but before we answer it, I'd like to point you in the direction of a few more of my favorite Slate links from this past week:"	What I Read This Week When I Wasn't Writing About Donald Trump

23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/marco_rubio_s_organization_isn_t_nearly_as_good_as_his_opponents_the_florida.html	"Ask a political observer to name the front-runner in the Republican presidential primary--and after moaning about Donald Trump--they'll probably offer one name: Sen. Marco Rubio. It makes sense. Rubio is a strong political talent with a gift for rhetoric. He has an unrivaled ability to condense Republican Party ideas into sound bites tied to his story and identity. He can segue from a capsule summary of his life--""As I've said many times before, my parents were never rich people""--to classic conservative rhetoric. ""Here's the best way to raise wages--Make America the best place in the world to start a business or expand an existing business."" Rubio also sits well with most Republicans. The vast majority of Republican voters would support him in a general election, and he's well-liked in early states like Iowa and New Hampshire. Other than immigration, where he faced conservative opposition in 2013, Rubio is close to a consensus choice for the GOP, well-placed to win the nomination. But there's a problem. In polling and in organizing, Rubio isn't winning. In fact, he isn't even close. After a modest growth through November, Rubio has settled at nearly 15 percent support in national Republican polling. He's almost tied with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, and far behind Trump, who pushes 30 percent in the Real Clear Politics average. But unless you're at the bottom, like Jeb Bush, you can almost ignore national polls; they don't tell us much about the final outcome. Things are different for the early primary and caucus states. Heavily polled, they give us better insight into who could prevail, especially as we close the year and approach the actual contests. And in those states--Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina--Rubio is far from the top. His best performance is in New Hampshire, where he holds about 12 percent support. That puts him second to Trump's 28.6 percent, and a few points above his establishment rivals: Bush, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.* If they dropped out before voting, Rubio might overcome Trump. But that's unlikely: They've staked their chances on the state, and they have enough money and support to make it competitive. Rubio has two months to consolidate support in New Hampshire. Otherwise, he may lose the state to Trump, as voters--for the second time in recent memory--choose the demogogue in the GOP race. In Iowa, likewise, Trump and Cruz have the lead, with Trump falling from first and Cruz rising from second. Rubio is in fourth place, and absent a rapid surge--fueled by a major shift, like the full collapse of Bush and Fiorina--he'll likely stay there. Moreso than Iowa or New Hampshire, South Carolina seems like fertile ground for Rubio. Evangelicals dominate the electorate, but they aren't as rigid as their Iowa counterparts, who often fall hard for factional candidates like Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum. And with the exception of Newt Gingrich in 2012, they don't back insurgents. Instead, voters in South Carolina tend to ratify the consensus choice for the nomination, whether it's John McCain in 2008 or George W. Bush in 2000 or Bob Dole in 1996. But there as well, Rubio lags. He's third behind Trump and Carson, and is losing oxygen to Cruz, who is surging with help from former Carson supporters. Because polls aren't set in stone, it's tempting to take this all with a grain of salt. And if Rubio were hustling--if he were using his cash and support to make contacts, find supporters, and prime them for voting--that would be the right choice. But the striking fact of his campaign is that he's not on the grind, at least not compared to his rivals. ""In recent conversations with nearly a dozen unaffiliated Iowa GOP veterans, a consensus has emerged across the party's ideological spectrum,"" write Tim Alberta and Eliana Johnson for the National Review. ""The state's caucus-goers are interested in Rubio, but his infrequent appearances and paltry field operation leave lingering doubts as to whether he is interested in them."" According to National Journal's candidate tracker, Cruz has held 67 events in Iowa since entering the race. Rubio has held 38. The Rubio campaign believes it can win with a ""different kind of campaign that eschews spending on policy staffers, field operations, and other traditional aspects of a winning bid in favor of television advertising and digital outreach."" The Cruz team thinks differently, investing in voter contacts and direct interactions. ""Ted Cruz has done perhaps the best job in the state, frankly,"" says Sen. Tim Scott of the Cruz campaign in South Carolina. And while Rubio can still buckle down in New Hampshire, he must contend with Christie, who has devoted his entire campaign to winning the state. It's possible for Rubio to win the nomination without winning the early states. It took a month and six contests before Bill Clinton claimed his first win in the 1992 Democratic primaries. Indeed, Clinton claimed the lead with a second place finish in New Hampshire. Could Rubio do the same? Maybe, if Cruz can't turn infrastructure into votes, and if Trump collapses. Or, if he sees an opening and consolidates the establishment behind his candidacy. Or even if the race comes to him and Cruz. But those are big ""ifs."" When Rubio entered the race, he was the promising candidate who faced major hurdles to success. Now, eight months later, he's in the same position. Everything on paper says Rubio is the guy. Everything on the ground, so far, says we shouldn't hold our breaths. Correction, Dec. 10, 2015: This article originally misspelled Gov. John Kasich's last name. (Return.)"

24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/the_media_didn_t_make_donald_trump_and_it_should_keep_reporting_on_everything.html	"A bizarre piece of meta-commentary that trickles in whenever Donald Trump says some insane thing, and journalists flood the zone over it, is as follows: The media should be ignoring him. He is clearly just saying something for attention, and so the appropriate adult way to respond is to deny him the attention he seeks. In feeding the beast, the media is complicit in a vicious cycle, in which Trump says something nuts to get attention, the media gives him that attention, that attention is responsible for his high numbers, and then he does it again. Jeb Bush, who is not getting much media attention--something that perhaps he should be grateful for since much of the attention has been negative--told reporters Tuesday that Trump is ""playing you guys like a fine Stradivarius violin. ... This is what he does. He's an expert at this, he's phenomenal at garnering attention."" Arianna Huffington, whose publication announced in July that it would cover Trump under its Entertainment vertical instead of Politics, reversed that decision in a blog post Monday that strangely omitted the part where she might acknowledge that her news organization completely misread the political story of the year. Huffington argues that ""Trump, aided by the media,"" has brought us to this wild point wherein a leading presidential candidate is saying crazy things. He says a destructively crazy thing, the media abettors publicize it, and here we are. Huffington writes that her news outlet will now cover Trump under Politics but will strive to point out that Trump is a racist or a xenophobe in its write-ups. As if no other publication has considered this over the last five months, while the Huffington Post was dismissing the racist, xenophobic proto-fascist as an entertaining ""sideshow"" unworthy of its vigorous political consideration but certainly worthy of placement as a click-receptacle under a more frivolous but well-trafficked banner. I do not think that the media should ignore Trump when he says crazy things. Ha! I would say that, right? But really. I am of the school that thinks it is the media's duty to cover a presidential candidate when he or she says crazy things, intentionally or not, and to provide the coverage, even if they crave the attention. Because doing so does not help Trump to the extent that he believes it does. It has, instead, likely helped to seal his doom at one stage or another in the process. Any presidential candidate could stampede Trump-like across the media if they so choose, saying insane thing after insane thing with few, if any, intermissions for non-insane utterances. It's not especially hard. What is an outlandish, racist, xenophobic, sexist, anti-Semitic, or just plain nonsensical thing that might earn plenty of attention and (re-)rile up the baser elements of the electorate? Coming up with crafty insults or unconstitutional policies that might briefly feed the id is not especially difficult. For the most part, presidential candidates hope to avoid appearing blatantly awful or uninformed in the media spotlight because it hurts their chances. Ben Carson, an excellent surgeon, has very little knowledge of national public policy, foreign or domestic, and the heavy dose of media attention that he received once he began rising exposed these flaws. Carson is now plummeting. That is usually what happens when someone completely unprepared for the presidency gets media attention and cannot effectively answer basic questions. Trump has famously broken that trend. He's covered negatively and with extreme scrutiny because he says a lot of awful things. What we've found out this year is that a not-insignificant segment of the Republican Party loves the awful things he says and credits him with the ""courage"" for saying them. Let's say that group's about 25 to 30 percent of the party, if the polls are correct. So Trump keeps saying awful things along these lines in order to keep that group happy. But Sen. Marco Rubio or Sen. Ted Cruz or Gov. Chris Christie could also call for, say, a ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"" and lordy, would they get plenty of attention, too. CNN and MSNBC and Politico and Slate would be all over the story because we'd have a viable presidential candidate calling for blanket discrimination on the basis of religion. And that candidate would get a boost among one element of the party. The reason they don't say these things, or suggest that Megyn Kelly was mean because she was probably menstruating, or whatever else, is because they hope at some point to cobble together a majority of Republican delegates and, eventually, a majority of electors. Trump's behavior makes the people who like him really like him, but it turns off a much bigger chunk of the pie. The media is enabling Trump--to hang himself. He's chosen a campaign strategy of using media attention to lock up roughly one-quarter of the primary vote, and in doing so, mortgaged off his chances of winning the presidency. He enjoys being the polling frontrunner, an honor he only gets by virtue of the absurdly large Republican field. If there's one group that really could enable Trump's ability to become the nominee, it would be the crowded ""establishment lane,"" if it ever gets around to its much-needed self-winnowing. But if Trump or any other candidate wants to use the media to make him or herself an unelectable, one-dimensional candidate who's repellent to most people? Hit us up. The system works, at one point or another."	The Media Didn't Make Donald Trump
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/house_conservatives_need_to_stop_promising_crazy_stuff.html	"House conservatives have spent the past few years making life hell for Republican leadership. On the face of it, this approach doesn't make that much sense tactically. But there is one argument that comes close to intersecting with reality as a rational explanation for House conservatives' intransigent behavior against their leaders. It goes as follows: During election time, Republicans make bounteous promises to their voters in order to secure congressional majorities, and then they can't convert these promises into legislative gains. One can understand how concentrations of conservative voters and their representatives find this frustrating. On the charge of overpromising, Republican congressional leaders are guilty. In his 2014 re-election campaign, for example, Mitch McConnell pledged to play brinksman through the appropriations process. ""[Obama] needs to be challenged, and the best way to do that is through the funding process,'"" McConnell said in August 2014. ""He would have to make a decision on a given bill, whether there's more in it that he likes than dislikes."" Though McConnell is trying to shepherd some victories through a spending-package negotiation later this month, he did abandon his cavalier attitude toward brinksmanship by pledging, almost immediately after securing his position as Senate majority leader, that there would be no shutdowns under his watch. Makes sense! The public tends to blame the Republicans for shutdowns and shutdown threats, and not just out of habit. It's typically because Republicans make shutdown stands over deeply ideological demands that the rest of the country does not believe are worth a shutdown. Though the party prospered in the 2014 midterms following a 2013 shutdown, it might not fare as well in a presidential cycle during which Senate Republicans are on defense. The only defense that House conservatives are playing though, no matter the cycle, is against their right flank in potential primary challenges. They follow an alternate set of incentives that are in direct contrast to the rest of the party's. It's this tension--between those who are politically compelled to uphold all of the wildest promises made during election season, and those who are compelled to moderate--that's the source of all of the party's congressional problems. Fortunately there's a solution to all of these that works for both sides: stop overpromising. Instead of promising to do a lot of things that aren't anywhere near achievable, you just ... don't do that? The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza captures the tension well in a meaty profile of the House Freedom Caucus, the several-dozen conservative members who generally vote as a bloc either for or against--typically against!--pieces of important legislation. Amidst all the whining about how ex-Speaker John Boehner reprimanded them once or twice for constantly going out of their way to humiliate the party, HFC members try to defend their brand of tactical hardball, a generous term we'll use to describe the process of selecting one losing battle after another. Rep. Jeff Duncan, for example, runs through for Lizza the list of promises Republicans made in the 2010 ""Tea Party wave"" cycle and finds few of them met."	Some Advice for House Conservatives: Maybe Stop Promising Voters Crazy Stuff?

Instead, the reaction from his GOP rivals has pretty much looked like what we've seen: Trump says something no politician would dare say, his opponents declare it out-of-bounds, the press covers it all, and Trump gets stronger. J.K. Rowling says Trump is worse than Voldemort, the GOP party chairs in South Carolina and New Hampshire have spoken out against him, but his rivals have only mildly escalated their rhetoric from what they've said before. The Republican foreign policy response to the threat from ISIS and the Obama years has been a call for strength, conviction, and clarity--everything they think President Obama lacks. Trump has been presenting himself as the anti-Obama. He says that when Americans are scared, his poll numbers go up. So Trump is showing he's the strongest one out there--making the boldest move. Sen. Ted Cruz is pitching in his latest campaign ad that ""we won't cower in the face of evil,"" but Trump is going well beyond that to offer an aggressive vision of what not cowering could look like. Are bedrock American values being trampled by locking Muslims out of the country? Dick Cheney thinks so. He said Trump's plan ""goes against everything we believe in."" The former vice president is no weakling in the rhetorical strength game Trump is playing. But in a competition of values versus security, Trump's supporters will go with security, judging from the reaction he got Monday night at a rally in South Carolina and from the conversations I have had with them. ""These others are boys,"" Dennis Beck, a Navy veteran who patrolled the waters off of Cuba during the missile crisis, said to me referring to Trump's GOP rivals. ""He is a man."" Jeb Bush called Trump ""unhinged."" Sen. Marco Rubio disagreed with the proposal and said, ""His habit of making offensive and outlandish statements will not bring Americans together."" Gov. Chris Christie called it ""a ridiculous position and one that won't even be productive"" on Michael Medved's radio show. In the Republican national security debate, all GOP candidates have defined linguistic critiques of their strong rhetoric as a sign of weakness. So when Trump's opponents respond to his words, he dismisses them as politically correct and ignorant of the realities facing the world. When Trump's opponents condemn him, they offer his supporters proof that Trump is right. He's doing what they like about him in the first place--he's speaking his mind. If Trump had really gone too far, his opponents would do more than swap out adjectives. They'd give a speech devoted to the topic--or several of them--making an argument in defense of the bedrock American values they say Trump is destroying. Or, they'd make the case that this kind of policy shreds American values in just the way ISIS would like, turning the fight into one between the West and Islam. Privately, the strategists to these campaigns worry that there's already a cost to Trump's rhetoric. The cheers Trump gets for his no-Muslims policy send the message overseas that there is a virulent anti-Muslim feeling in America. Forget what the leaders say, goes the thinking, the cheering is the real truth of American sentiment. It will always have sway in a democracy. Graham has been the candidate most loudly making this case. ""He is helping the enemy of this nation. He is empowering radical Islam. And if he knew anything about the world at all, you would know that most Muslims reject this ideology and they have died in--by the thousands trying to combat his radical ideology. You are slanting their sacrifice. You are marginalizing what they are trying to do to make the world a better place. Do you know how you win this war? You side with people in the faith who reject this ideology, which is 99 percent."" Trump's rivals pay a price for having been in such constant conflict with him already. When Sen. Lindsey Graham tells Trump to go to hell, it sounds new but not that new from the guy who called Trump a jackass several months ago. When House Speaker Paul Ryan criticizes Trump it gains some weight from its novelty. Ryan hasn't weighed in on the presidential campaign. ""This is not conservatism,"" said Ryan. ""Some of our best and brightest allies in this struggle and fight against radical Islam terror are Muslims."" Every GOP presidential candidate has pledged to support Trump if he's the nominee. No one has changed that view, despite their condemnation of his remarks. I asked a strategist for one of Trump's rivals why that person's boss, after heaping so much condemnation on Trump, didn't announce a refusal to support Trump's nomination. ""What's to be gained from saying it?"" the adviser asked. In other words, there would be no political gain to be made by going that far. Sure, there is a moral case to make that would be amplified by refusing to support Trump if he were the nominee, but the calculation is that in the GOP primary, that would cost too much with voters. But if the political risk of responding to Trump doesn't embolden them to do anything beside pull out the thesaurus, then voters are apt to think that the underlying offense can't really be that great. This would be considered weakness by the definitions used in the primary this year. On the other hand, Trump's opponents might be practicing tactical restraint. Trump could fall by the accumulation of his dramas. Voters in key voting states might turn away from him as they evaluate candidates based on their temperament and qualifications, not their excitement. Also, given the anxiety created by the San Bernardino, California, attacks, any opponent is at a rhetorical disadvantage when voters are edgy. A full-throated confrontation with Trump could get away from them. He's better at this than they are. Better to wait, when the emotional turf favors your skills. This is Cruz's strategy. He said in response to Trump that it was ""not my policy."" Donald Trump takes risks. His opponents are risk-averse. What his actions convey--and it seems to be working for him--is that he's willing to court chaos in the name of what he believes. If that's the actual way the electorate works, anyone unwilling to take a similar risk is sending the opposite signal. In this battle of strength, as the campaign has so far defined it, he is winning."	Trump's Rivals' Condemnation Won't Be What Weakens Him
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/donald_trump_is_expressing_the_bigotry_of_the_republican_party_s_base.html	"On Monday, in a press release, Donald Trump called for a ""complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States."" It's the latest in a series of envelope-pushing statements, which, according to pundits, were supposed to have killed off Trump's presidential candidacy long ago. We keep thinking Trump has gone too far. And, as measured by polls, we keep being wrong. Maybe it's time for those of us who have predicted Trump's demise--reporters, liberals, moderate Republicans--to face an unpleasant possibility. Trump isn't out of touch with the electorate. We are. Trump speaks for a plurality of today's Republicans, and many independents as well. That's just as true on the subject of Muslims as on other topics. One of America's two ruling parties is controlled by voters who are ready to turn the government against a religious minority. If you don't think this can happen in our country, you haven't been paying attention to recent polls. In June, Gallup asked Americans, ""If your party nominated a generally well-qualified person for president who happened to be Muslim, would you vote for that person?"" Seventy-three percent of Democrats and 58 percent of independents said yes. Fifty-four percent of Republicans said no. Ben Carson, a leading GOP presidential candidate, shared that view. In September, he said on national television that Americans shouldn't ""put a Muslim in charge of this nation."" Shortly after his remark, a Suffolk University/USA Today poll asked likely voters: ""Would you vote for a qualified Muslim for president?"" Sixty-three percent of Democrats and 54 percent of independents said they would. But Republicans, by a margin of more than 30 percentage points, said they wouldn't.* Likely Republican voters were also closely divided on whether President Obama was a Muslim. Forty-one percent said he wasn't. Thirty-three percent said he was. A Rasmussen survey, also taken after Carson's statement, asked likely voters: ""Would you personally be willing to vote for a Muslim president?"" Seventy-three percent of Republicans said they wouldn't. So did 48 percent of unaffiliated voters. To smoke out respondents who were only pretending to be open-minded, the survey asked people whether most of their ""family, friends and co-workers"" were willing to vote for a Muslim. Only 10 percent of Republicans said yes. During this time, from September to October, the Public Religion Research Institute broadened the investigation beyond presidential voting. To get at broader attitudes toward Muslims, PRRI asked nearly 2,700 Americans to consider a statement: ""The values of Islam are at odds with American values and way of life."" Fifty-two percent of Democrats disagreed with the statement. But 57 percent of independents agreed with it. So did 76 percent of Republicans. In a two-week frenzy beginning on Oct. 31, ISIS slaughtered more than 400 people around the world. First it killed 224 passengers on a Russian airliner. Then it blew up another 43 in Beirut. Then, on Nov. 13, it slew another 130 in Paris. After the Paris attack, U.S. pollsters asked about Muslims again. A Bloomberg survey, taken from Nov. 15 to 17, asked Americans which of two statements came closer to their views. One statement was: ""Islam is an inherently violent religion, which leads its followers to violent acts."" The other statement was: ""Islam is an inherently peaceful religion, but there are some who twist its teachings to justify violence."" Most Republicans chose the ""inherently peaceful"" version. But 32 percent (compared with 17 percent of Democrats) chose the statement that Islam was inherently violent. In a YouGov/Economist poll conducted from Nov. 19 to 23, 71 percent of Republicans, compared with 45 percent of independents and 39 percent of Democrats, said Muslims posed at least a ""somewhat serious threat"" to the United States. Forty-seven percent of Republicans, compared with 28 percent of independents and 22 percent of Democrats, said Muslims posed an ""immediate and serious threat."" Only 22 percent of Democrats and 30 percent of independents said they thought that the majority of Muslims worldwide supported ISIS. But 46 percent of Republicans said the majority of Muslims supported ISIS. Would this deepening anti-Muslim sentiment create popular support for policies that explicitly targeted Muslim Americans? To answer that question, a Rasmussen survey on Nov. 17 and 18 asked likely voters: ""Should most individual Muslims be monitored by the government as potential terrorists?"" Only 24 percent of Democrats and 29 percent of independents said yes. But a 43 percent plurality of Republicans supported the idea.* The hottest subject is refugees. After Paris, Republican presidential candidates Sen. Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush said the United States should favor Christians (Bush's idea) and bar Muslims (Cruz's idea) when screening refugees from Syria. In a four-day survey beginning on Nov. 16, ABC News and the Washington Post asked Americans whether, in accepting refugees from ISIS-affected parts of the world, the United States should give ""special consideration to Christians,"" or whether we should instead give ""equal consideration to all people who've been persecuted by ISIS, regardless of their religion."" The poll question pointed out to respondents that the groups persecuted by ISIS included not just Christians but also Yazidis, ""Shiite Muslims,"" and ""moderate Sunni Muslims."" Nevertheless, 30 percent of Republicans (compared with 15 percent of Democrats and 14 percent of independents) said the United States should favor Christians rather than treat persecuted minorities equally. That survey overlapped with one by Fox News. The Fox poll asked registered voters about the idea of ""allowing Syrian refugees who are Christian to come to the United States [while] preventing access to Muslim refugees from Syria."" The question directed respondents to choose between two statements. One statement was: ""It makes sense--Christians in the Middle East have been targeted by Muslims and are not likely to be terrorists."" The other statement was: ""It's shameful--There should not be a religious test for who is welcomed into the United States."" The anti-discrimination statement was so morally loaded that I figured it would drive respondents away from the Christians-only policy. And it did: Only 10 percent of Democrats and 21 percent of independents chose the Christians-only policy. Nevertheless, 37 percent of Republicans chose that policy. Fewer than half the Republican sample chose the alternative statement against religious tests. When you remove the moral cues about ""religious tests"" and ""equal consideration,"" Republicans lose all compunction. That's what happened in the Nov. 19-23 YouGov/Economist poll. The survey asked: ""Do you think the United States should or should not accept Syrian refugees who are Muslim?"" Fifty-two percent of Democrats said we should accept the refugees. But 83 percent of Republicans, along with 62 percent of independents, said we shouldn't. The San Bernardino, California, attack took place on Wednesday. Over the following two days (with probably half the interviews conducted before respondents learned that the female terrorist had pledged allegiance to ISIS), a Reuters/Ipsos poll asked Americans what they thought of Muslims in the United States ""following the events in Paris and San Bernardino."" Sixty percent of Democrats and 57 percent of independents chose this answer: ""I view the Muslim community in the same way as any other community in the United States."" Only 30 percent of Republicans chose that answer. Forty-eight percent of Republicans chose a different statement: ""I am fearful of a few groups and individuals in the Muslim community."" Twenty-one percent of Republicans chose a third statement: ""I am generally fearful of the Muslim community."" In the Reuters survey, 63 percent of Republicans, compared with 37 percent of Democrats and 47 percent of independents, agreed that ""Muslims living in America have been less willing to assimilate into American society than other immigrant groups."" Sixty-three percent of Republicans also agreed that ""Muslims living in America generally place religious beliefs above U.S. law."" And while 60 percent of Republicans agreed that ""churches in the U.S. should be closed if authorities suspect they have ties to extremist groups or individuals,"" that number jumped to 69 percent when the word mosques was substituted for churches. Together, these polls paint a sobering picture of Trump's party. Forty-three percent of Republicans say the government should monitor most Muslims. Fifty-four percent say they wouldn't vote for a qualified Muslim for president, even if that candidate were nominated by the GOP. Fifty-seven percent say Islamic values are at odds with American values. More than 60 percent say not only that mosques should be closed based on suspected ties to extremists, but also that Muslims in general think they're above the law. As for Trump's proposal to bar Muslim refugees, it's not even close. When the question is presented without cues, 5 of every 6 Republicans agree with him. So let's stop pretending the problem is Trump. The problem is the base--and by many measures, the majority--of the Republican Party. If you think we can't elect a government in 2016 that would target a religious minority, you're underestimating Trump. And you're overestimating America. *Update, Dec. 8, 2015, at 11:15 a.m.: In the Suffolk University/USA Today poll, an even greater percentage--not just more than 20 percentage points, but more than 30 percentage points--of Republicans said they wouldn't vote for a qualified Muslim for president. (Return.) *Update, Dec. 8, 2015, at 3:25 p.m.: Rasmussen Reports has provided data showing that in its Nov. 17-18 survey, 43 percent of Republicans supported surveillance of most Muslims, while 40 percent of Republicans opposed it.

28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/12/chris_christie_rises_in_new_hampshire_polls_his_gains_help_donald_trump.html	"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, the presidential field's nearest carbon copy of post-9/11 George W. Bush Republicanism, is finally ""back,"" by which I mean he has hit double digits in one poll of one state. But New Hampshire is an important state, one in which he's been laying the groundwork for gains with constant town halls and where his net favorability has made a swift turnaround in the right direction. The Republican center-right establishment, which spent most of 2012 and 2013 deifying Christie as the Republican Party's messiah, has rekindled its faith after a challenging period of doubt. As soon as word got out that the New Hampshire Union Leader would endorse Christie, fleece-jacketed chat show Morning Joe, for example, decamped to New Hampshire to host an episode with Christie and the Union Leader's opinion editor. Christie once tickled pink the ""responsible right"" with manufactured YouTube videos of him screaming at his constituents, and we should expect those same boosters to feel all the feelings, once again, if he can successfully wield his brand of tough-dad speak against Donald Trump in a New Hampshire showdown. If only it were that simple. I hate to be awful and rain on this resurrection. But the last thing that the center right, the establishment, the responsible right, the business Republicans--whatever you'd like to call Republicans who are terrified of Trump winning the presidential nomination--needs right now is a suddenly competitive Christie. Unless he really does catch fire and unify the center right in a way that no other candidate has thus far been able to do, he's just another warm body earning enough support to divide the anti-Trump vote and deliver New Hampshire into Trump's short-fingered hands. The establishment doesn't need new candidates jumping into the mix; it needs them dropping out. The first poll of New Hampshire since the Union Leader's endorsement, conducted by Public Policy Polling, vividly illustrates this dynamic. Trump leads with 27 percent of the vote. Good for him. But that's still only 27 percent, leaving plenty of space for a non-Trump actor to maneuver. The problem is that there are several proud non-Trump establishment actors in the mold of traditional New Hampshire winners vying for the same space: Sen. Marco Rubio earns 11 percent, Chris Christie 10 percent, John Kasich 8 percent, and Jeb Bush 5(!) percent. One of these four candidates, according to my betters, is ""supposed"" to win New Hampshire and use that as a launching pad for unifying the establishment and its resources behind his candidacy. Instead what they're doing is divvying up the large pool of center-right support. New Hampshire is crucial to the establishment because its voters are the most moderate of the three early voting states. It's not just that it would be best for an establishment candidate, like Sen. John McCain or Mitt Romney, to make an early show of strength by winning it. It's also important to stop the Iowa winner, typically an anti-establishment crusader, from picking up any further momentum. If Bush, Rubio, Kasich, or Christie loses Iowa, they can soldier on. But their lack of consolidation opens the possibility that Trump or Sen. Ted Cruz--now second in PPP's poll, at 13 percent--could pull off the elusive Iowa-New Hampshire double and head into the Southern swing, their more natural turf, with serious bragging rights. If Trump or Cruz pulled off such a feat, the proper collective action response for the establishment would be to tell three of these guys to pop off. Kasich may well exit soon after New Hampshire. But the other three may not have any reason to drop out. Christie, the least resourced of the three, will get all the money he needs from megadonor Ken Langone and his pals if he can put in a not-terrible New Hampshire showing. Rubio, Bush, and their affiliated super PACs will have preposterous amounts of money to work with, for as long as they want. Consider that Bush's super PAC is currently doing the ad-buy equivalent of lighting money on fire for sport right now, and there will still be plenty left over. The worst part about these establishment candidates is that they'll all have pride. Mike Huckabee, Sen. Rand Paul, Rick Santorum, Carly Fiorina, and Ben Carson all know (hopefully?) that they're not supposed to win. Rubio, Bush, Christie, and Kasich, though, believe that they're supposed to win. Their likes always win--these are the rules! If Trump and Cruz run all over them through the first few states, they'll continue to argue that it's a fad and the ""serious"" candidates will soon have their opportunity. One imagines them still muttering this to themselves, in a cold-sweated state of delirium, even as they're watching Trump accept the nomination at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Maybe one of them has what it takes to stop Trump. Four of them don't."	Why Chris Christie's Sudden Gains Are Good for Trump

Last time we met here, I was writing about gender stuff for Slate's women's vertical, Double X. Now I write about Internet stuff for my tech column, Users. Last week, I published my first Slate cover story on my new beat, a reported tale of what it was like to work at Sony Pictures Entertainment in the year after a devastating hack destroyed the movie studio's systems and threw its private information to the wind. If you hear of any weird corners of Internet culture I ought to explore--or other digital catastrophes that have befallen real human beings--my DMs are always open. It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry. I've ... obviously been listening to Adele's belated breakup anthem ""Hello"" for two weeks straight, not because I chose to play it on repeat, but because nearly every mainstream American cultural machine, from Saturday Night Live to college football, has been smothering itself in Adele's syrupy song since its release. Join me in making sense of the madness by reading Slate music critic Carl Wilson's analysis of how Adele sold easy listening to generation BuzzFeed by tapping into the youth's thirst for instant nostalgia. Then, gather 'round to watch this Southern University marching band cover of the song, which features both a cacophonous chorus played by a bleacher's worth of unwarmed brass instruments and a slow-motion sexy-dance by the Southern U. dance squad. L.V. Anderson wonders if the so-bad-it's-good arrangement is a part of some ""collective practical joke""; I'm hoping its viral teaser for David Lynch's next teen alterna-soap. One of my favorite things about reading Slate is its ability to pick at the silly minutiae of pop culture (like the tyrannical middle school teacher who has banned her students from using the verb ""said,"" or the bizarre viral rumor that Leonardo DiCaprio will be raped by a bear in his next film--twice) while delivering big-picture analysis of serious global news events, like the recent attacks on the people of Paris, Colorado Springs, and San Bernardino. In the magazine this week, I was grateful to my colleagues for helping me make sense of this senseless violence. Will Saletan addressed the U.S. governors who've vowed to bar Syrian refugees from their borders in the wake of terror in Paris, and explained why they should be more afraid of the religious extremists born and bred in the USA--extremists like Robert Dear, the man who's been charged with first-degree murder for allegedly shooting up a Colorado Planned Parenthood clinic. At Double X, Michelle Goldberg drew a connection between anti-abortion rhetoric and the wave of recent violent attacks on abortion clinics: Dear was not a committed anti-abortion activist, Michelle writes, ""but this doesn't mean he wasn't caught up in the anti-Planned Parenthood fervor that's lately been stoked by the right"" and which has turned PP into ""a symbol of evil in the right-wing imagination."" And Mark Joseph Stern made an impassioned case that the right to not be shot ought to outweigh the right to bear arms. He writes: ""If constant gun massacres are an inevitable result of American liberty--if we cannot be truly free without letting every madman, abuser, and hothead with a grudge get guns, if we cannot send our children to school without fearing they may be slaughtered in a hail of bullets--we need to reconsider what liberty truly means."" Thanks for reconsidering with us. Until next time, --Amanda"	These Stories Helped Amanda Hess Understand Adele, Right-Wing Rhetoric, and Gun Violence
