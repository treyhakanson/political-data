On the morning of July 21, as they trickled into the annual Christians United for Israel conference, the mostly American supporters of the Jewish state walked past muted TVs blaring the latest damage reports from this-or-that foreign correspondent. More than 100 Palestinians died in one day; more than 445 Palestinians since the operation started. The supporters of CUFI moved up the convention center escalators and took their seats for a plenary session. Onstage were the first guests, all recognizable from Fox News--Weekly Standard editor-in-chief Bill Kristol, onetime CIA director James Woolsey, and the Council on Foreign Relations fellow Elliott Abrams, a presidentially pardoned veteran of foreign policy disasters on two continents. Sitting right next to them was John Hagee, the burly Christian Zionist pastor who founded CUFI in 2006 He leaned into a microphone, passionately explaining why supporters of Israel should not be tricked by casualty reports. ""Since July 8, more than 1,000 rockets have been launched into Israel by Hamas from Gaza,"" said Hagee, who speaks with a captivating rumble that could make a brunch order sound like a lost gospel. ""Two-thirds of Israel's population has had to run to bomb shelters, having 90 seconds to save their lives."" The objective of Hamas, said Hagee, ""is to win the media war with dead civilians. We've come to Washington to ask our government to stop demanding for Israel to show restraint."" More than 4,800 evangelicals and Jews broke into applause. Some raised their arms and turned up their palms; a shofar-maker from New Jersey blew on one of his horns. ""If a foreign power had launched 1,000 rockets into America, we would be pulling the gates of the White House down,"" said Hagee. ""Let Israel finish the job. Let every rocket be dismantled. Let every tunnel be destroyed."" Hagee had set the theme: This year's CUFI conference, followed by its members' lobbying trips to Congress, would pressure the Obama administration not to broker an early cease-fire in Israel. The people of Israel would not suffer so that ""John Kerry could win his Nobel Peace prize."" (Hagee made that joke again at an evening, music-and-dancing stuffed CUFI celebration, which started with a taped message from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.) American evangelicals needed to imagine themselves as Israelis, praise the ""miracle"" of the Iron Dome missile defense system, and understand that the Jews had a biblical mandate to the entire Holy Land. ""I'll bless those that bless you and I'll curse those that curse you,"" said Hagee, quoting from the book of Genesis. ""That's God's foreign policy statement, and it has not changed."" CUFI claims to be the world's largest coalition of pro-Israel evangelicals. Nobody disputes that; critics actually prefer to promote Hagee as the face of the movement. In 2007, after CUFI started to gain momentum, Hagee published a book laying out how the apocalypse would happen--the Antichrist, if you were wondering, would be ""the head of the European Union""--and in 2008 John McCain's presidential campaign was cowed into denouncing him. Progressive journalist Max Blumenthal reported on the 2007 Christians for United Israel conference and asked the faithful if they were looking forward to the rapture. After getting a few yeses--and after asking Hagee pointed questions about Scripture--Blumenthal was sent to the exits, and CUFI got more gingerly and careful in its approach to the media. How careful? The reporters who showed up--many from conservative or pro-Israel media--were guided through a metal detector to a filing center, away from the main conference. At the appropriate times, we were guided from the first floor hideaway to the third-floor ballroom where the plenary sessions were being held. When the sessions ended, we were given time to wrap up, then politely guided back downstairs. But during breaks it was easy to chat with attendees, to walk through a CUFI exhibit on how it was fighting the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement on campuses--and to notice that Hagee's books were on sale next to CUFI T-shirts. In Hagee's latest, Four Blood Moons, he advances the theory that a series of lunar events that started on April 2014 means that ""in these next two years, we're going to see something dramatic happen in the Middle East involving Israel that will change the course of history in the Middle East and impact the whole world."" Hagee keeps saying this stuff; CUFI keeps separating itself from the rapture-ready bestsellers. On Monday I asked David Brog, the Jewish executive director of CUFI, whether Four Blood Moons was informing any of Hagee's or the activists' thinking about the crisis in Israel or Russia. ""Absolutely not,"" said Brog. ""Outside observers don't give evangelicals credit for being able to hold two different ideas in their heads. There's often confusion, when it comes to evangelical support for Israel, because evangelicals, like a lot of Jews, believe that we may be living in a messianic time. Of course, in the Jewish case, no one ever says--'Ah, that's why you support Israel, you think you're going to bring the messiah.' It's black letter Christian theology that the date of the second coming was set eons ago."" Brog had obviously answered countless versions of the question, usually from more hostile inquisitors; in the response I got, he insisted that CUFI's members, like many evangelicals, ""have a profound sense of guilt in the Christian Era, and how the Holocaust happened and Christians didn't do anything about it."" That was backed up by the speeches, and by the hallway conversations. Israel was one war away from destroying Hamas--unless John Kerry stopped it. Iran was one missile away from a second Holocaust--unless the Obama administration acted. On Monday night, Hagee gave a special award to Republican super PAC donor Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, who turned and thanked the mostly Christian audience for backing Israel. ""If you had been there during the Holocaust, you would have stood up and fought for the Jewish people,"" said Miriam Adelson. ""And maybe the Holocaust wouldn't have happened."" ""I've never had a greater warm feeling than being honored by Pastor Hagee,"" said a beaming Sheldon Adelson. But the honors were mutual. Speaker after speaker gave the evangelicals ammunition for the next time someone criticized the Gaza operation, or shamed Israel over the body count. ""Here's a message for America: Don't ever turn your back on Israel, because God will turn his back on us,"" said South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham. ""More Germans died in World War II than American soldiers. That didn't make the Germans right."" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who debuted at the conference in 2013 and got its loudest ovation this year, walked the crowd through all the Obama administration betrayals. Remember, how Kerry had warned that Israel could become an apartheid state--a ""slander and a lie."" Remember how Kerry had acknowledged the BDS movement and angered Israel's leaders. The Obama administration was naive; CUFI wasn't. ""It is Hamas who is putting women and children on top of the rockets,"" said Cruz, ""because they value the missiles and rockets more than they value their own civilians."" The politicians were limited in what they could say. They had been to Israel--Graham credited a trip he took with the Adelsons for ""changing my life."" But they were not Israelis. Over two boisterous days, the only speaker who brought the crowd to silence was Sgt. Benjamin Anthony, an Israel Defense Forces veteran whose organization Our Soldiers Speak sent him to campuses and other hot zones to describe the reality in Israel. ""There is an entire generation being raised in southern Israel, barely any of whom do not suffer from PTSD due to the rocket fire,"" said Anthony. ""The entire Zionist experiment rests in no small part on what it is we do during this campaign."" What the IDF needed was a total victory. ""Rocket factories can be destroyed,"" said Anthony. ""Weapon factories can be destroyed. Terrorists can be eliminated. Tunnels can be dug out."" But it could only happen if America resisted the temptation to criticize Israel or to stop the operation. ""Hamas started this war,"" said Anthony. ""The soldiers of Israel must smash their skulls and break their spines."" When he said that, a standing-room crowd of pastors and activists and politicians rose to its feet, waving the twin flags of the countries God loved."	Inside the Most Insanely Pro-Israel Meeting You Could Ever Attend	['Blumenthal', 'Israel', 'Obama']	['god']

Elizabeth Warren gives the same frustrated answer. No. Nope. She is not running for president. She has literally rolled her eyes at the question. She's offered to ""add an exclamation point."" She's even signed a letter calling on Hillary Clinton, who leads polls of Democrats by up to 50 points, to run for president. And yet there they were on Friday morning, the people who wanted Warren to reconsider. Days before this year's Netroots Nation conference, the annual gathering of the online left, an Obama campaign veteran launched a draft campaign called Ready for Warren. (The name is a wink at the pro-Clinton PAC Ready for Hillary, which claims to have 2.5 million supporters in its database.) The new group printed ""Warren for President"" signs and plastered ""Warren for President"" stickers on free skimmer hats. As activists entered the Cobo Center, which resembles a pile of faded Rubik's Cubes that have tumbled from a closet, volunteers handed out the goods. There was even a folk song soundtrack, by Jessie Murphy: Americans want our next president to be a woman
 Hey babe, here's lookin' at you, Senator Elizabeth Warren
 The planet is warming and the power is shifting
We will need a leader who won't stand for all the Wall Street bullshit, the lobbyist grifting The reluctant hero never stood a chance. When her applause lines hit, up went the signs. ""The game is rigged,"" said Warren toward the end of her remarks. ""We can whine about it, we can whimper about it, or we can fight back. I'm ready to fight back. Are you ready to fight back on this?"" Up went the signs, up went the chant: ""Run, Liz, Run."" ""Si'down,"" Warren chuckled. ""Si'down."" But the story was already being told. The signs made it into write-ups by Politico, Huffington Post, McClatchy, and a Washington Post story about how ""cracks are beginning to emerge"" in the Clinton restoration's coalition. The evidence for a left-wing challenge to Clinton that could defeat her is thin to nonexistent. Defeating Clinton wasn't even a theme at Netroots Nation, where in 2007 both Sens. Barack Obama and John Edwards clearly outpaced her in support. Anyone who could force Clinton to the left--on Wall Street, on bank reform, on student loans, on inequality--was worth talking about. Not far from where Warren was speaking, a D.C. activist named Edrie Irvine was sporting a Bernie Sanders for President 2016 shirt, and getting into conversations that assumed the Vermont senator could never win. ""I love my Bernie,"" said Irvine. ""I want him to run not because I expect that he would ever win, but because he would force the conversation in a direction it might not otherwise go."" That's just it. Progressives want to change the party, which means more than choosing a president. (Several Netroots panels featured activists who had moved the Obama administration when it was acting too slowly on issues like immigration.) The institutions that created the online left were birthed by no-chance campaigns. MoveOn was founded in 1998 by Silicon Valley liberals who wanted Congress to stop short of impeaching Bill Clinton. ""Censure,"" it said, ""and move on."" Howard Dean's 2004 campaign brought in a young generation of activists and techies, spawning some of the data and campaign companies that would elect Barack Obama. Yet MoveOn lost its first fight. The Dean campaign lost every major primary. The lesson activists took away: Try something. The media, at least, is going to cover a primary threat more than it covers a sui generis student loan bill. Thus the Warren ""presidential campaign,"" a masterful branding and messaging exercise. In September 2013, the New York Times wrote an attention-getting profile of Warren's appeal to progressives, proven by the growing crowds for organizers wise enough to book her. ""Bumper stickers and T-shirts surfacing in liberal enclaves proclaim, 'I'm from the Elizabeth Warren Wing of the Democratic Party.' "" Jonathan Martin reported that those stickers were mass-produced by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which was founded in 2009 by Adam Green (a veteran of MoveOn and Democratic campaigns) and Stephanie Taylor (a veteran of the SEIU, AFL-CIO, and yes, MoveOn). In its early years, the PCCC confounded Democrats, losing a run of primaries and buying ads to pressure red state Senate Democrats who were slow-walking the Affordable Care Act. The Warren brand--earned after the group signed up activists and donors for her nascent Senate bid--is self-evidently a way to move the conversation, whether or not anyone challenges Clinton. ""We're going to make sure that every Democrat who runs for president is forced to say whether they agree with Elizabeth Warren on key issues,"" Green told the Boston Globe last year, ""like expanding Social Security benefits and more Wall Street reform."" Green repeated that point at the Netroots conference, though he hardly needed to. Rep. Dan Kildee, a freshman Democrat from one of the new safe Michigan districts, said it was ""clear"" that any 2016 candidate had to cop from Warren. ""The basic premise, that we need to restore some balance in the equation between corporate interests and consumers--that's what she's done for a long time,"" he said, recalling how he'd cited her when he worked at a think tank. ""More people should embrace it. It cuts across partisan lines. "" But he wasn't calling for a primary. The point was getting the next candidate to move where the Netroots crowd wanted her to move. ""Hillary Clinton is going to say these things,"" said former Rep. Brad Miller, a North Carolina Democrat who left his seat after a 2011 gerrymander. ""Whoever our Democratic nominee is will run as an economic populist. When the pollsters and consultants come back with the numbers, they'll tell her: Holy crap, you may not have been a populist before, but you are one now! The problem will be credibility, and whether it's believable coming from someone who has close ties to the financial sector."" At the conference, for most attendees, Clinton was credible enough. A Ready for Hillary organizer pointed out that some of the people who applauded when they saw Warren at a nearby hotel were sporting Hillary gear. There was no mass boycott of the main Friday night party, sponsored by Ready for Hillary, held at a downtown music venue called St. Andrews, with the PAC's bus parked right outside. As guests arrived, they ran into a table loaded with PAC stickers (""I'm ready for Hillary"") and the room-filling pop of KGB, a Motown cover band. Activists born in the 1980s; music from the 1960s. Not the ideal metaphor for a Clinton campaign, but it got a PCCC leader tweeting that after ""one more margarita"" even he, too, would be ready for the Clintons. I didn't find a true Clinton critic, actually, until the next night's after-party. It was hosted by the Alliance for American Manufacturing. (In a Saturday speech, the labor group's president, Scott Paul, had told activists to nominate ""a woman who not only says the right thing but does the right thing."") At the party, I ran into the last guy who challenged Clinton from the left and lost. Jonathan Tasini, a writer and activist who ran against Clinton in the 2006 New York U.S. Senate race, was at least willing to muse about one of the progressive branding campaigns turning into an actual primary. ""Warren would have the best chance,"" he said. ""Whenever [Hillary] opens her mouth, there's enough people who say: 'I just don't believe her.' "" But how many Democrats? In 2006, Tasini asked progressives to hold Clinton accountable for backing the Iraq War. She won the primary with 83 percent of the vote. And on this particular Saturday night, the Clinton agita was not too serious. On the way out of the party, Scott Paul spotted me and corrected the record on his quote--the one absolutely everyone interpreted as a call for Warren to run. ""I saw the tweet about that,"" he said. ""I wasn't talking about Warren!"""	Why the Movement to Elect Elizabeth Warren Is Make Believe	['Sanders', 'Paul', 'Obama', 'Clinton', 'Warren']	[]
2	2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/07/west_s_wildfires_are_getting_worse_government_polices_are_encouraging_developers.html	"A wildfire that began last week in central Washington has already destroyed an estimated 150 homes. At last count, it was threatening more than 500 other structures as firefighters continue to struggle to contain a blaze that has covered more than 300 square miles. A separate wildfire in southern Oregon destroyed 17 homes and 16 other structures, and forced the evacuation of more than 100 people last week. A third blaze currently raging in Idaho, one of about 20 sparked across the Boise National Forest by a lightning storm, has forced the evacuation of at least 60 homes. None of these wildfires are particularly unique. Home-threatening blazes have become something of an annual ritual for many towns out West, one increasingly untethered to the calendar. In the past four decades, the length of the wildfire season has increased by more than two months. The average wildfire, meanwhile, now burns roughly twice as long and consumes twice as many acres than it did a decade ago. Since 2010, the number of structures destroyed by the fires has tripled, and firefighter fatalities have soared by a factor of four, according to the nonprofit research group Headwaters Economics. The Obama administration estimates it will spend $2.4 billion this year battling the blazes, nearly triple what was spent in an average year two decades ago. And the current spending levels are fast proving insufficient: This month the president sent Congress an emergency request for $615 million to help cover the government's wildfire-fighting bill. Already bad, things are only going to get worse. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that wildfire activity could double in much of the Western half of the nation by 2050 as climate change leads to hotter and drier conditions across the country. While Congress has repeatedly shown no interest in combating (or, in some cases, even acknowledging) climate change, Western lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are finding it difficult to ignore the fires themselves. A bipartisan group of senators is currently rallying around a relatively straightforward proposal to help route more federal cash to both fighting the wildfires and preventing them. The proposal, championed by Oregon Democrat Sen. Ron Wyden and Idaho Republican Sen. Mike Crapo, would make catastrophic wildfires eligible for assistance from a special federal disaster relief fund currently used to pay for recovery efforts from hurricanes and earthquakes. That tweak, supporters say, would allow the U.S. Forest Service and the Interior Department to stop rerouting cash from other crucial programs, including needed fire-prevention work such as removing dead vegetation and undergrowth that can act as tinder. A separate Republican proposal, backed by Sen. John McCain and others, meanwhile, would explicitly require the federal government to focus on thinning the underbrush in federal forests. But while lawmakers might be looking at a bigger picture, they still aren't looking as broadly as they should, wildfire experts warn. ""It's basically an account shuffle, one that does nothing to really address the magnitude of the problem,"" says Ray Rasker, the executive director of Headwaters Economics, which held a private brainstorming session for 20 policy experts earlier this year to talk about the rising risks and costs of wildfires. The most pressing issue, Rasker's group concluded, is the slew of government policies currently in place that subtly encourage developers to build in wildfire-prone areas in the first place. Local governments are the ones deciding whether to develop the land, but it's the federal and state governments that have to open their wallets when disaster strikes. As a result, local officials have little incentive to stop a high-risk development when they stand to reap the property tax rewards without bearing the full risks. ""The consequences of those development decisions aren't being felt by the people who are making them,"" says Rasker. If federal lawmakers took steps to shift the financial burden to local governments, the thinking goes, they'd be less likely to give carte blanche to developers. Lawmakers looking to offer carrots in addition to the stick, for instance, could tie the amount that each locality had to pay to how much effort it put into preventive measures in the first place. Impose tighter building codes in high-risk areas? Foot less of the federal firefighting bill if a wildfire does break out. Fail to take preventive action? Be prepared to pay on the back end. Lawmakers looking to take more direct action, meanwhile, could limit the mortgage interest deduction for any home in a particularly vulnerable region. Intended or not, the status quo has resulted in a building boom in fire-prone areas. According to the International Code Council, 60 percent of new homes built in the United States between 1990 and 2008 were built on what is known as the ""wildland urban interface""--basically private forested land in close proximity to public forested land, the type of landscape that's particularly vulnerable to wildfires. Such policies wouldn't mean an end to building on those lands, Rasker says--it would just mean that communities would be enticed to make more deliberate and safer decisions on exactly where and how to build. That might not stop many wildfires from starting, but it would mean fewer homes in harm's way when a wildfire does jump from public forest to private land. That, in turn, would mean more time, money, and options for firefighters trying to contain the massive blazes. But if Congress continues to fail to see the homes through the trees, the opposite will hold true: The government will be stuck paying more money to fight stronger fires that threaten more houses. ""This is a trend,"" Rasker says, ""that's going to get significantly worse if things don't change."""

Thousands continue to come into the country, and President Obama has called the influx an ""urgent humanitarian situation,"" asking Congress for $3.7 billion in funding to deal with the children and families that have arrived. Complicating the problem are growing protests against the immigrants. ""I'm protesting the invasion of the United States by people of foreign countries,"" said one person at a recent demonstration in Oracle, Arizona. ""This is about the sovereignty of our nation."" And at a similar one in Murietta, California, demonstrators held signs saying ""illegals out!"" and called for the U.S. government to ""stop illegal immigration."" But for as much as this anger is organic, growing from fear and anxiety, it's also true that conservative media figures have stoked tensions with wild and dishonest rhetoric on the supposed threat of new arrivals. ""Dengue fever, 50 to 100 million new cases a year of dengue fever worldwide. In Mexico, it is endemic. It's a terrible disease, for anyone that's had it,"" said Fox News host Marc Siegel, who continued with a warning. ""There's no effective treatment of it. It's now emerging in Texas because of the immigration crisis."" Likewise, on her radio show, Laura Ingraham declared, ""The government spreads the illegal immigrants across the country, and the disease is spread across the country."" Republican politicians have joined in as well. ""Reports of illegal immigrants carrying deadly diseases such as swine flu, dengue fever, Ebola virus, and tuberculosis are particularly concerning,"" wrote Georgia Rep. Phil Gingrey in a recent letter to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. His colleague, Texas Rep. Randy Weber, sounded a similar note in an interview with conservative pundit Frank Gaffney: ""I heard on the radio this morning that there have been two confirmed cases of TB--tuberculosis--and either one or two confirmed cases of swine flu, H1N1. ... We're thinking these are diseases that we have eradicated in our country and our population isn't ready for this, so for this to break out to be a pandemic would be unbelievable."" And Rep. Louie Gohmert--no stranger to the offensive outburst--told conservative publication Newsmax that ""we don't know what diseases they're bringing in."" But we do, and the reality is nowhere close to dire: While a handful of reports suggest there are incoming children with illnesses like measles and tuberculosis, the vast majority of these minors are healthy and vaccinated. Moreover, according to the Department of Homeland Security, border agents are required to screen ""all incoming detainees to screen for any symptoms of contagious diseases of possible public health concern."" In short, the odds that migrant children would cause a general infection of anything are slim to none, right-wing claims notwithstanding. These facts are easy to find, but it's not a surprise that immigration opponents would claim otherwise. For as long as there have been immigrants to the United States, there has been scaremongering about their alleged disease and uncleanliness. What we're hearing now, put simply, is an update on an old script. ""On the morning of 19 May 1900,"" writes American University professor Alan M. Kraut in an essay titled ""Foreign Bodies: The Perennial Negotiation over Health and Culture in a Nation of Immigrants,"" ""the Chinese community of San Francisco found itself under siege in the name of state and municipal security. It was not fear of bombs or terrorist attack that inspired officials to commit a wholesale violation of civil liberties that morning; it was fear of disease, specifically bubonic plague."" That wasn't the first quarantine of San Francisco's Chinatown, and it wouldn't be the last. Nor was it a surprise--local authorities long regarded Chinese immigrants as a threat to public health, a manifestation of long-standing nativist fears. To wit, notes Kraut, ""The Irish were charged with bringing cholera to the United States in 1832. Later the Italians were stigmatized for polio. Tuberculosis was called the 'Jewish disease.' "" The entire discourse of 19th- and early 20th-century politics was saturated with attacks on immigrants as diseased intruders to the body politic. Indeed, this dialogue culminated, in 1891, to Congress, with revision of the 1882 Immigration Act to exclude ""persons suffering from a loathsome or a dangerous contagious disease"" from entry into the United States. ""Asians were portrayed as feeble and infested with hookworm, Mexicans as lousy, and eastern European Jews as vulnerable to trachoma, tuberculosis, and--a favorite 'wastebasket' diagnosis of nativists in the early 1900s--'poor physique,' "" write scholars Howard Markel and Alexandra Minna Stern in a 2002 paper on ""the persistent association of immigrants and disease in American society."" Vivid examples of this association aren't hard to find. ""[E]very ship from China brings hundreds of these syphilitic and leprous heathens,"" writes one editor in an issue of Medico-Literary Journal. Likewise, wrote one columnist in an Oct. 3, 1907 edition of the Princeton Union, ""[German immigrants] produce large and swarming hives of children who grow up dirty, ignorant, depraved, and utterly unfit for American citizenship."" And in a Dec. 1, 1906 edition of the Deseret Evening News, one writer complained of ""runners"" in southern and eastern Europe who ""tell fairy tales about the prosperity of the many immigrants now in America and the opportunities we offer to aliens. It is by such means that paupers and diseased persons are induced to make the journey, only to find that they are shipped back upon landing."" Mass participation in World War II changed American perspectives of European immigrants, and later, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 ended national quotas and opened the doors to a huge numbers of immigrants from around the world. Still, the link between immigration and disease has persisted through the 20th century and into the 21st. In the 1980s, for example, the influx of Haitian refugees merged with the AIDS crisis to produce a new wave of anti-immigrant discrimination. ""When AIDS appeared suddenly in the 1980s,"" writes Markel and Stern, ""it was quickly conflated with deviant sexuality and several minority groups, ranging from gays and intravenous drug abusers to Haitians and Africans."" In 1983, the appearance of HIV among several Haitian detainees led the CDC to add the group to its list of ""recognized vectors"" for the virus, and in 1990--acting on potent AIDS stereotypes--it banned all Haitians from donating blood in the United States. What's more, that same year, the Immigration and Naturalization Service began to detain and quarantine HIV-positive immigrants at the U.S. base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. And in 1993, echoing earlier language against ""paupers and diseased person,"" Oklahoma Sen. Don Nickles introduced a bill prohibiting the entry of all HIV-positive immigrants on economic grounds, arguing that--if we didn't--""it will almost be like an invitation for many people who carry this dreadful, deadly disease, to come into the country because we do have quality health care in this country ... and jeopardize the lives of countless Americans and will cost U.S. taxpayers millions of dollars."" Beyond the present situation, the most recent attacks on immigrants as carriers of disease came during the Bush administration. In 2005, an episode of Lou Dobbs Tonight falsely asserted, ""We have some enormous problems with horrendous diseases that are being brought into America by illegal aliens,"" including 7,000 cases of leprosy in the past three years. On his radio show, Bill O'Reilly agreed that immigrants were crossing the border with ""tuberculosis, syphillis, and leprosy,"" and in 2006, Pat Buchanan claimed ""illegal aliens"" were responsible for bedbug infestations in ""26 states."" In reality, health officials attribute the growth in bedbugs to ""widespread use of baits instead of insecticide sprays"" for pest control. Today, anti-immigrant protesters hold signs asking Washington to ""Save our children from diseases,"" while right-wing lawmakers fret about disease screening and spread fears of infection and contamination. In doing so, both draw from a long history of ugly nativism and prejudice dressed as concern for public health. And you don't have to be a liberal, or support immigration reform, to see that it's a disgrace."	America's Long History of Immigrant Scaremongering	['Buchanan', 'Obama']	[]

I stepped down as editor on Monday, which means this is the first time in, oh, 18 years, that I haven't read the magazine critically. So is Ali Griswold's piece on smartphones in restaurants any good? I don't know! Readers are raging about Jordan Weissmann's account of a Comcast customer service call gone awry--I just scanned the headline. What human foible did Dear Prudence explore this week? Beats me! Instead, I've spent the whole week in a nostalgic haze about Slate, so let me at least put those tears to use by sharing a few of my favorite deep cuts, the old, spectacular pieces that I return to again and again and again. My favorite piece in Slate history is Herb Stein's ""Watching the Couples Go By."" Herb wrote this in 1997, shortly after his wife of 60 years died, and it is an economist's musing on love. It has the hard, crackling exoskeleton of analytical brilliance that you expect from Slate, but a soft, creamy, heartbreaking center. I could fill an entire book with favorite Seth Stevenson stories. Maybe the funniest is ""Extroverted Like Me,"" his diary of taking Paxil to overcome his shyness. Don't miss the part about ""delayed orgasm""! One of the greatest pleasures of my working life was editing Emily Yoffe's gonzo column, Human Guinea Pig. She did all kinds of ridiculousness for a story--street performing! Nude modeling! Learning math!--but nothing topped her magnificent effort to win the Mrs. Washington D.C. contest. Slate has a proud history of enlisting famous people down on their luck to write for us. Perhaps the best example was when we sent Henry Blodget, just coming off his troubles, to cover the Martha Stewart trial. He began like this: ""Given the current state of my reputation ... readers may want to take everything I say with a grain of salt."" Disaster helped produce some of Slate's best journalism. Rebecca Liss' piece about the Marine who found the last two survivors of the World Trade Center attack is so moving and odd that we re-run it every Sept. 11. Blake Bailey was driven from his home by Hurricane Katrina: His piece about the poet who rescued him will make you weepy. How to pick a favorite Christopher Hitchens piece? Or Mike Kinsley piece? Or Jacob Weisberg piece? I tried. And tried. And tried. What about Slate's new bosses? What are their best stories? New editor-in-chief Julia Turner wrote one of the most popular stories in our history, this slideshow history of the bikini. (Hmm, wonder why that was popular?). But my favorite Turner is her series about signage, in particular this story about why Penn Station is the most confusing spot on the planet. New deputy editor John Swansburg etched his name in history with the definitive takedown of ""your stupid birthday dinner."" And executive editor Josh Levin: ""The Welfare Queen,"" of course. Let me finish with what is undoubtedly the wrongest piece in Slate history. In 1996, a Slate writer spent a month reporting on White House geography, Secret Service techniques, and presidential logistics, and concluded that it was impossible for the president to commit adultery.

This proud movement would engage all the right-thinking members of the citizenry, liberal and conservative. It would enliven the daily discourse and it would push Sen. Elizabeth Warren to run for president. At the moment, the Democratic contest looks like it will be a foggy, repetitive march toward Hillary Clinton. It will have all the safety, risk aversion, and lack of impact of Clinton's recent book, Hard Choices. The latest polling from NBC and Marist shows just how dominant Clinton appears. She beats Vice President Biden among Democratic voters in Iowa 70 percent to 20 percent and in New Hampshire 74 percent to 18 percent. Eighty-nine percent of Iowa Democrats view Clinton positively. In New Hampshire, she is more popular than flannel: Ninety-four percent view her warmly, which may set some kind of record for humankind. If Warren joined the race, she would not win, but she would till the ground, putting grit and the smell of earth in the contest. She would energize the Democratic Party's liberal base, which would then stir up other Democrats who seek to moderate or contain that group. Warren would challenge the Democratic Party on issues like corporate power, income inequality, and entitlements. She would be a long shot and she would have nothing to lose--which means she could keep talking about those ideas out loud.  Because Clinton is close to Wall Street and finance executives and Warren is gunning for them, she has the potential to put campaign pressure on Clinton that other candidates can't. Clinton and other candidates would be forced to explain where they stood more than if Warren weren't in the race. Whether you agree with Warren's ideas or whether she would even make a good president is immaterial to the benefits of her candidacy. She would keep the campaign lively and focused on ideas. That is the role Newt Gingrich occasionally played in 2012. It's the role that former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush would play in 2016 on issues like Common Core education standards and immigration. If you are a liberal, you'd hope Warren would win, of course, but since she almost certainly wouldn't, you'd hope that she would pull Clinton to the left or at least push her to make some left-leaning commitments. If you are a Clinton Democrat--which based on that polling is a redundancy--it's hard to see how a tough competitor who might weaken your candidate would be a welcome thing. But without a get-in-shape primary, would Clinton be ready for the close punches of the general election? Her book tour suggests she's rusty. A Democratic coronation would start the general election attacks early, without the benefit of a clear GOP opponent she could counterattack. A primary fight would force Clinton to draw clear lines about what she believes, why she's running, and why her message is something more than ""It's my turn."" These are all things smart Democratic strategists say she needs to do. The Democratic primary race would be covered by a fevered media obsessing over a battle between two female candidates, which would mean Clinton's sharpened message would be broadcast to the general election audience, helping her in the fall. Warren would help Clinton put her best foot forward in another way. Warren has never run anything. Clinton would exploit her opponent's lack of experience by discussing her relatively vast resume. That would lead to a conversation about presidential qualities, a worthy conversation some of our best Americans have been trying to promote for years. How important is it to have the temperament, experience, and toughness that come from being in the Washington battle for so many years? What are the downsides of Hillary Clinton's veteran status? The reason a Warren candidacy should have broad ideological appeal is that if you're a conservative there's something in her campaign for you, too. It will either expose Democrats for the socialist one-worlders that they are or bruise Clinton for the coming general election fight. But there's also a more high-minded reason. If Rick Santorum is right and the Republican Party will only flourish at the presidential level if it promotes conservative solutions for middle-class voters, then this cause will be helped along by a Democratic contest that keeps the battle of ideas for the middle class at the center of the debate. While Democrats are debating their offerings to that constituency, it will give conservatives a chance to offer their alternatives. Presidential campaigns are not a trifle. They grind people up. That is why Warren is probably wise to continue saying that she won't run. But if she believes in the ideas she says she does, one of which is that the system is rigged in favor of those with money and power, a place to demonstrate her commitment to changing such arrangements would be to announce her candidacy for the highest office in the land."

It's a perfect location from which to troll a Democratic president. The Chamber readily obliges. For much of the Obama presidency, four banners reading J-O-B-S have been draped across the Chamber's facade, as if trying to send the world's least subliminal message, 24 hours a day. For as long as the banners have been there--longer, actually--the Chamber and the president have actually agreed on something. The federal gas tax (18.4 cents for a gallon of regular, 24.4 cents for a gallon of diesel) has not increased since 1993, which is one reason why Congress keeps passing short-term extensions of the Highway Trust Fund, billions of dollars for ongoing construction projects. It's also the reason why Congress scrambled to pass another extension before a September deadline. The scramble worked--by a 367-55 majority, a highway bill passed the House. But it didn't include a gas tax. In 2008, candidate Obama chided both Sens. John McCain and Hillary Clinton for floating the idea of a gas tax holiday. His Republican secretary of transportation, Ray LaHood, campaigned for a gas tax hike. Every year of Obama's presidency, Chamber President Tom Donohue has called for a slight increase in the tax. ""The American business community is saying we don't see this as a tax,"" explained Donohue in 2009. ""This is a user fee."" He's repeated that and repeated that, making national news each time. ""Shippers are for it,"" he said of the tax hike in May. ""Truckers are for it. The construction industry is for it. Labor is for it, and the Chamber is for it. If Congress were serious about ensuring money goes to the most essential projects, many motorists would be for it, too."" Congress opted instead for an epic punt, based on a gimmick that has nothing to do with gas taxes. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives is offering to let companies set aside less money for pensions so that they'll theoretically report more taxable income, theoretically delaying the highway fund apocalypse until May 2015. As Josh Barro pointed out, the gimmick actually costs money in the long run, but it syncs up with Congress's 10-year budgeting. On Tuesday, as Republicans marked up the bill, they only tried to defend it by saying that it was bipartisan, and hey--they could make the tough call later. ""This is the only package with a history of big bipartisan votes,"" said Rep. Pete Sessions, the Rules Committee's chairman. ""These policies that have previously received bipartisan and bicameral support,"" said Pennsylvania Rep. Bill Shuster, chairman of the Transportation Committee, and the son of former chairman Bud Shuster, as Sessions kept pointing out by referring to his ""young"" colleague. (Shuster is 53 years old.) ""Bipartisan,"" in this Congress, has been a soothing synonym for ""kludge."" Democrats and the Chamber simply want a gas tax, as do at least two Senate Republicans who aren't facing primary challenges this year. At the markup, the might of this coalition was represented by Oregon Rep. Earl Blumenauer, who represents the city of Portland, dons bow ties, and wears a lapel pin shaped like a bike. He had proposed raising the gas tax from 18.4 cents per gallon to 33.4 cents, but that bill wasn't getting anywhere, so he was left arguing to move the deadline for new action from May 2015 to sometime this year. ""Think about it!"" said Blumenauer. ""It's going to be an evenly, narrowly divided Senate, and half the Senate will be running for president. To think, in the other body, that they're going to be able in a couple of months to solve the funding problem? This is not going to get easier next year."" ""It may or may not be easier to achieve it now or later,"" said Sessions. The meaning of that gibberish may depend on what ""easier"" is supposed to mean. Conservative groups have belatedly entered the debate on the funding package. The Club for Growth and Heritage Action have, predictably, warned Republicans to vote no or have it scored against them. ""This bill uses budget gimmicks and fee increases to bail out a wasteful and inefficient program that shouldn't even exist,"" argued the Club for Growth. ""In many ways this resembles the sequester,"" offered Heritage Action President Michael Needham, ""with the Democrats overplaying their rhetorical hand as 93 percent of total highway and transit spending will continue apace."" Republican leadership is openly--well, anonymously--mocking the outside groups. As far as House Speaker John Boehner is concerned, these conservative groups lost their clout after the government shutdown. But among conservatives, the end of the shutdown (i.e., the funding of the Affordable Care Act) was proof that the party establishment has no vision or credibility. In 2013, it was Georgia Rep. Tom Graves who first proposed tying the year's mandatory spending bill to the defunding of Obamacare. In 2014, it's Graves who's come up with the conservative antidote to the highway bill. Graves's bill is HR 3486, the Transportation Empowerment Act. Yes--it's called the TEA Act. Backed by the Club for Growth and by Heritage Action, and sponsored by 46 of his peers, Graves' bill would devolve ""most"" highway funding responsibilities to the states, ideally enough to cut the gas tax down to 3.4 cents. With Congress flailing and punting, conservatives think they can shift the window of acceptable debate. Come 2015, the mainstream would drift even further from the Chamber/Democratic position. ""Each 'no' vote,"" wrote Heritage's Needham, ""brings those reforms closer to reality because it signals the inevitable end of the bankrupt status quo."" That's the irony of the whole mess--nobody's campaigning for ""the status quo."" The Chamber and the White House are asking for the first gas tax hike since 1993. Their impediment is a Congress that prefers to move money around on spreadsheets than to pass any tax. At Tuesday's hearing the Democrats, who'll be counted on to back the House's kludge, could only scoff at how stupid the process had become. ""This is just a suggestion,"" said Massachusetts Rep. Jim McGovern, a Democratic member of the Rules Committee, ""but if you guys are still in the majority after the election--I pray that you're not, but in case you are--you may want to revisit this issue of earmarking."" New York Rep. Louise Slaughter, who ran the committee during Nancy Pelosi's speakership, simply ran out of words. ""I remember the days when the most bipartisan bill was transportation,"" said Slaughter. ""This is not even half a loaf. This is a comma in a page. This is any port in a storm. I'm having a lot of platitudes today."""	How the Boring Highway Trust Fund Became the Newest Stage for GOP Antics	['Blumenauer', 'Obama', 'Clinton', 'Slaughter', 'McCain']	[]
7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/07/obama_and_the_senate_race_democratic_candidates_don_t_want_the_president.html	"Mark Udall hardly even tried to fake it. In January, after President Obama's State of the Union address, CNN's Dana Bash asked the first-term Colorado senator if he wanted the president to campaign in his state. Udall had won his 2008 race by 10 points, and Obama had carried the state twice, which made it all the more perplexing when the senator replied with a nonsensical word salad.

""We're gonna be running a strong campaign based on Colorado's interest, Colorado's future,"" said Udall. ""My job, I think, is to protect Colorado's way of life. We've got a wonderful way of life."" Meaning? ""We'll see what the president's schedule is. We'll see what my schedule is."" The president arrived in Colorado this week. Udall did not appear with him. ""It bothers me a lot,"" one liberal Coloradan told a reporter, as she took her place at an Obama rally. Maybe Udall couldn't believe that he was in a close race with Republican Cory Gardner, a cherub-faced congressman whose brightest moment in the spotlight came when he asked Kathleen Sebelius to defend the ""brosurance"" health care ad campaign. But Udall's fear and trembling gave Gardner a week of easy attack lines. In campaigning, as in facing down a bear in the wilderness, it has never been a good idea to broadcast weakness. So, how should other Democrats behave toward the president? This election year presents them with the most unforgiving Senate map a party has faced in a generation. There are seven seats currently held by Democrats in states won by Mitt Romney in 2012. Republicans only need to win six of those races (and hold on elsewhere) to take the Senate. There are at most two states, Georgia and Kentucky, where Democrats think they have any chance of winning a Republican seat. Romney carried those states too. When asked if she wanted President Obama to stump for her, Kentucky's Democratic star Alison Lundergan Grimes nonanswered that hers was a ""race that's one about putting the people of this state first."" Please remember that Mark Udall's tap dance happened in a state that Barack Obama actually won. Twice! The 2014 election is likely to give us many more moments of gut-wrenching agony and Democrats going all Apostle Peter on the president they universally supported when elected in 2008. Members of the White House political team will grit their teeth and ask low-level campaign staffers if, you know, it would be OK for the commander-in-chief to show up. They will be told to call back in a few days. Often, they will be told, ""No thanks, but send money."" This won't console the candidates, but they are not the first to find themselves trapped between their voters and an unpopular president. In 1998 and in 2006, both the second midterm years of struggling presidents, lots of candidates agonized over whether to let the most powerful man in the world land his plane near them. Their campaign staffers admit that there's rarely a scheduling issue so serious as to cancel or skip a historic visit. They advise, mostly, to just let the guy come and campaign. ""There can be scheduling conflicts, but very few are real,"" says Bob Shrum. In 1998, he was consulting for Senate candidate John Edwards in North Carolina, a state Bill Clinton had lost twice. ""It was the middle of the impeachment stuff, it was a Southern state, and [incumbent Sen.] Lauch Faircloth was running with this predictable stuff--two 'liberal lawyers,' Clinton and Edwards."" The Edwards campaign debated it--should Edwards raise money, in the state, with the soon-to-be-impeached president? They went for it, but they had an angle. Shrum approved ads that mocked Faircloth for his many (often procedural) votes supporting Clinton's position. Like many Democratic campaigns of that year, Team Edwards went after the Republicans for their overzealous investigations of the president. This worked, and Edwards won, but none of the incumbent 2014 Democrats are in as strong a position as Edwards was. Their predicament resembles that of Jim Talent, a one-term Republican senator from Missouri who faced re-election in the brutal 2006 cycle. George W. Bush had won Missouri twice, but his numbers had slipped into the rain gutter, and Talent went into the election trailing Democratic recruit Claire McCaskill. The White House called to see if President Bush could show up. The Talent campaign thought it over. ""The thinking was, everyone knows that Talent was a conservative,"" remembers Talent's campaign manager at the time Gregg Keller. ""You're not going to convince folks that the president is some persona non grata. It is what it is. We were looking at numbers and realized we needed a pop in southwest Missouri. The president did rallies in Joplin and Springfield--we had 10,000 people at both."" The Talent campaign knew something that political scientists would have been happy to tell them. Presidential visits usually help a campaign, even when the president is wildly unpopular. Whether or not a president shows up to campaign, there is nothing stopping a rival from linking a candidate to the president of his party. He can Photoshop them together. The presidential appearance always serves to excite his base, as long as there is a base left to excite. ""I remember at one point being in the meeting where we're finally making the decision,"" says Keller of Bush's proposed visit. ""We have polling memos. We have the pro and con arguments. And I remember someone looking at me and saying, 'You know what, if Bush comes into Springfield, and if our folks don't get excited about that, we were never gonna win anyway.' "" The visit went well, but the build-up was a little humiliating for the Bush White House. Other campaigns had flat-out refused presidential visits; other campaigns, they didn't even bother to ask. This autumn will see countless fresh stories about how unpopular Obama is in most of the key states, paired with stories about how the candidates prefer visits by Hillary Clinton, or Bill Clinton, or Elizabeth Warren, or Joe Biden, or Howard Dean--basically, any Democrat who is not the president. The only candidates who might benefit from an Obama visit are the ones who need to thrill black voters again, as former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland did in 2010. He didn't win, but after polling as far as 17 points behind now-Gov. John Kasich, he lost by less than 3. The black  share of the electorate, 15 percent, was higher than it had been in 2008. ""I chose to fully embrace the president, and that was the right decision for me,"" said Strickland, who now runs the Center for American Progress Action Fund. Yet Strickland would not command his fellow Democrats, or fellow progressives, to show up when the president did. ""There may be situations where someone would feel like it would not be helpful. And I'm sure the White House would understand."""

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/07/science_fiction_writers_predicted_ukraine_conflict_now_they_re_fighting.html	"A pro-Western, NATO-backed Ukrainian government faces a stubborn insurgency in the pro-Russian East. Fighting rages around Donetsk, with civilians dying in artillery fire and airstrikes, while Russian troops mass on the Ukrainian border. The latest headlines? No, a two-novel series by Russian-Ukrainian science-fiction writer Fedor Berezin: War 2010: The Ukrainian Front and War 2011: Against NATO. In a startling plot twist, Berezin, a 54-year-old former Soviet Army officer and Donetsk native, is now living inside a real-life version of his own story: He is deputy defense minister of the embattled ""Donetsk People's Republic."" And this is just one of many bizarre overlaps between fantasy and reality in the current conflict in Eastern Ukraine--a convergence that prompted one Russian commentator, novelist Dmitry Bykov, to dub this conflict ""the writers' war."" Berezin's War 2010/War 2011 books, published in 2009 and 2010, respectively, were no uniquely prophetic vision; actually, they were the last in a string of novels depicting a near future in which Ukraine becomes a battleground in a larger East-West confrontation. A forerunner of the genre, Omega, by veteran sci-fi/fantasy writer Andrei Valentinov, came out in 2005, shortly after Ukraine's pro-Western Orange Revolution. It depicted three alternate-history versions of 2004, one of them a dystopia in which Crimea had been invaded and occupied by NATO forces in 1995; while the main characters were resistance fighters, they were both anti-Moscow and anti-NATO. (Valentinov, a Russian-speaking Ukrainian whose real name is Andrei Shmalko and who lives in Kharkiv, one of Eastern Ukraine's major cities, has professed equal distaste for ""Russian chauvinists,"" ""Ukrainian nationalists,"" and ""American globalists""; more recently, he has strongly affirmed his loyalty to Ukraine.) A far more straightforward vision of Russian good vs. Western evil is offered in The Age of the Stillborn by Gleb Bobrov, who like Berezin is an ethnic Russian from Eastern Ukraine (Luhansk) and an Afghanistan war veteran. The apocalyptic novel, set in a near future in which a brutal Kiev regime seeks to quash rebellion in the East with NATO help, was first published online in 2006 and became a hit on the Russian Internet before going to print in 2007. Donetsk citizen Grigory Savitsky made his literary debut in 2009 with Battlefield Ukraine: The Broken Trident, which depicts a scenario uncannily similar to Berezin's saga, right down to 2010 as the start of the war. The back cover summary refers to "" 'Orange' Nazis"" who provoke a civil war in Ukraine and unleash genocide against the Russian-speaking population, ""wiping entire cities off the face of the earth""--aided by NATO ""peacekeeping"" troops and American air power. The stream of Russo-Ukrainian war literature published in Russia at the end of the 2000s--both speculative fiction and conspiracy-theory nonfiction--alarmed Ukrainian politician Arsen Avakov, then governor of the Kharkiv region and now Ukraine's minister of internal affairs. In an emotional March 2009 post on the Ukrainska Pravda website titled, ""Do the Russians want war?"" Avakov suggested that the books were part of a deliberate Kremlin strategy to build up popular support for war against Ukraine by playing to Soviet nostalgia among older readers and ignorance among younger ones. Avakov was particularly scandalized by Berezin's involvement in the orgy of anti-Ukraine saber-rattling--because, in yet another quirk of fate, the two men knew each other fairly well from their Ukrainian science-fiction fandom. In his spare time away from politics, Avakov happens to be a sci-fi enthusiast; he founded and co-chaired the annual sci-fi/fantasy convention in Kharkiv, Star Bridge. (Launched in 1999, the convention was indefinitely suspended in 2012 due to squabbling between Avakov and Kharkiv's new pro-Russian mayor, Gennady Kernes.) Berezin was a Star Bridge regular for years and won numerous fiction awards at the convention, starting with first prize in the ""debut novel"" category for his 2001 novel Ash. ""I know Fedor personally!"" Avakov lamented in his post, sparing no punctuation marks in his dismay. ""How could he let himself be pulled into such things???"" Five years later, Berezin and Avakov are literally on the opposite sides of the barricades. Avakov, who stepped down as governor in 2010 after the Orange leadership in Kiev fell to the pro-Moscow Viktor Yanukovych and then joined the new government after Yanukovych's ouster in February 2014, urges tough action against the rebels in the East and bluntly refers to them as ""terrorists."" Berezin is one of those rallying the rebel troops--and waging war in the social media, directing his zingers at the ""Ukros,"" ""Maidowns,"" ""little Nazis,"" and lovers of ""gaymocracy."" After joining the ""people's army"" in Slavyansk on May 29, Berezin was promoted to deputy defense minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk Republic just a few days later. Announcing Berezin's appointment on VKontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook, ""defense minister"" Igor Strelkov openly gushed about his deputy's sci-fi connections (and his own odd mix of military experience): ""Considering that [Strelkov] is a historian and battle reenactor, it boggles the mind to think what we can do with a science fiction writer who is an anti-aircraft defense officer to boot!"" (Strelkov, a Russian citizen and former security services officer whose real name is Igor Girkin, is himself a newly minted fantasy writer; his recently published book of children's fairy tales, The Detective of Haldyborne Castle, has no direct connection to Ukraine but does extol militaristic virtues, in this case exemplified by a tribe of house gnomes who help the warlike lords of their castle fight against a villainous rival clan.) Meanwhile, Berezin's own LiveJournal update about his new appointment began with the words, ""I have found myself in an alternate reality."" A grainy video he recorded a few days later, which opens with the strains of the World War II-era Soviet battle hymn, ""Arise, great country!"" certainly has an air of alternate reality about it as the surprisingly soft-spoken, bespectacled man--who really does look the part of middle-aged sci-fi nerd more than military commander--urges the men of Donetsk to take up arms and defend their homeland against the enemy at the gates. At a rally in Donetsk in late June, Berezin told the crowd that the obvious goal of the Kiev government was to drive all the Russians out of Eastern Ukraine--""to blatantly steal our land and give it to the Americans and the Europeans."" It sounds like a page from Berezin's own novels. Yet in early July, after Strelkov and his men had fled from Slavyansk to Donetsk to make their last stand, Berezin told a correspondent from Rossiyskaya Gazeta, the official newspaper of the Russian government, that the truth of the civil war had turned out to be more terrifying than his fiction. For one, most of the Eastern regions' population had woefully failed to follow his script and join the insurgency. And besides, Berezin claimed, the actual Ukrainian army had turned out to be worse than the fictional Turkish occupation troops in his series: ""In the books, the Turks were actually more humane."" In fact, Berezin's novels are arguably not very high on humane attitudes toward enemy Ukrainians. The first volume in his saga, War 2010: The Ukrainian Front, ends with a scene in which a Ukrainian officer captured by the insurgents is summarily hanged for collaboration with the occupiers. ""It would be good to hang him in front of a big crowd, right in the middle of Lenin Square ... and leave him up for a week or so--let the crows have some fun and peck out his peepers,"" says one of the good guys, while another adds that ""various supporters of Atlantic blocs ought to be marched to the spot every day so they can get a whiff of what treason smells like."" The leader of the rebel group, Dmitry Gavrilovich, warns the younger men against ""cynicism"" and tells them that disposing of traitors should be viewed as ""dirty, unpleasant work"" rather than fun. But the author himself treats the final moments of the bound-and-gagged condemned man as a source of gleeful amusement: ""Of course, Danilo wanted very badly to scream--so badly that he actually peed his pants. Dmitry Gavrilovich turned out to be right: It really was the dirtiest work you could imagine."" As you can see, this is not exactly brilliant prose. But did it help instigate a war? In his essay on ""the writers' war"" in the independent Novaya Gazeta, Bykov goes so far as to say that the conflict in Ukraine was ""predicted, meticulously planned, and finally executed"" by sci-fi and fantasy writers. This is an exaggeration, and Bykov, who is known as something of a provocateur, concedes near the end of the essay that he did not mean it literally. (Interestingly, Bykov is the author of his own speculative epic, Living Souls, in which Russia is plagued by civil war and chaos after the discovery of a new wonder energy source robs it of both revenue and relevance.) Yet the exaggeration has an element of truth: The quasi-futuristic thrillers in which pro-Western Ukrainian ""Nazis"" seek to slaughter or enslave Eastern Ukraine's Russian population certainly helped prepare a fertile ground for the most paranoid charges against the current government in Kiev. And many of the people involved in the armed conflict probably do see it, on some level, as a chance to act out their fiction-driven war fantasies. Real life, unlike Berezin's and his comrades' fiction, currently seems very unlikely to end in the victory of the East's pro-Russian rebels. No one knows as yet if the leaders of the ""Donetsk Republic"" will flee to Russia, fight to the death, or face Ukrainian courts. In any case, Berezin has told Rossiyskaya Gazeta that if he gets out of his predicament in one piece, he will churn out fiction ""at machine-gun speed."" Perhaps he can write a novel in which a battle re-enactor and a military sci-fi writer team up to stage war games played with real bullets and rockets and real blood. It won't be too far-fetched."

9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/07/the_case_for_shutting_down_stuyvesant_high_school_the_best_public_school.html	"My alma mater, Stuyvesant High School, has been a lightning rod in New York City politics for as long as I can remember. Whenever critics have griped about the way Stuyvesant does business, my inclination has long been to say, essentially, ""Screw you."" Going to Stuyvesant is one of the best things to have ever happened to me. I met two of my lifelong best friends there, and being surrounded by thousands of the city's scrappiest strivers, most of whom were immigrants or the children of immigrants from New York's outer boroughs, taught me more than I ever learned from any teacher. The same goes for most of the alums with whom I've kept in touch over the years. Yet recently, as Mayor Bill de Blasio, state lawmakers in Albany, and the United Federation of Teachers have called for scrapping Stuyvesant's current admissions formula, I've come to the reluctant conclusion that Stuyvesant should close its doors. The same goes for elite public high schools like it across the country. Stuyvesant is one of New York City's ""specialized high schools."" To gain admission, you must first take an entrance exam. Every year, thousands of kids take the test--last year it was 27,817--to try their luck at getting into one of the city's eight specialized high schools. What separates Stuyvesant from the rest of the specialized high schools is simply that it has the highest cutoff. It admits the highest-scoring 950 or so students, not all of whom attend. This wouldn't be such a problem for de Blasio and his allies if it weren't for one awkward and uncomfortable fact, which is that Stuyvesant's admissions formula has not yielded a student body that looks like New York--not even close. Of the 952 admissions offers Stuyvesant made in 2014, 71 percent went to students of Asian origin, while only 2.9 percent went to black and Latino students, despite the fact that 70 percent of the eighth-graders currently enrolled in New York City schools are black and Latino. The shortage of black and Latino students is not new. They have been relatively rare ever since the school was established in 1904. As the city's demographics have changed, the absence of black and Latino students has grown all the more politically problematic. You might wonder how New York City, the citadel of urban liberalism, has allowed this racial imbalance to persist for so long. The reason is that Stuyvesant's straightforward, exam-based admissions process is enshrined in a state law, the Hecht-Calandra Act of 1971. There have been efforts to overhaul the law, to have it take into account grades and attendance and other measures that would all but guarantee that slackers like my eighth-grade self would never set foot in Stuyvesant again, but they've never had quite the momentum they do now. What I find irritating about the debate over Stuyvesant is the premise that if only the school admitted more black and Latino students, all would be well. This reflects a profound misunderstanding of how Stuyvesant works. Recently, Capital New York surveyed a panel of local education experts on how they'd go about changing Stuyvesant's admissions formula, and most of them recommended admitting the top performers on the test at public middle schools across the city, ensuring that each school sends kids to Stuyvesant. Given the fact that many of New York's middle schools are highly segregated, this would all but guarantee that more black and Latino students would be admitted to Stuyvesant and the other specialized high schools. It would also mean, however, that many capable students who'd be admitted under the current formula would be denied admission and that the concentration of talent that is Stuyvesant's great strength would be greatly undermined. One expert, Robert Tobias, a professor of teaching and learning at NYU's Steinhardt School, recommended making the admissions process more like what you'd find at an elite college, complete with teacher recommendations and a portfolio of the student's work, a proposal that would likely prove an extraordinarily expensive administrative nightmare. The most penetrating contribution came from Pedro Noguera, also a professor at the Steinhardt School, who raised an obvious but largely neglected point, namely that Stuyvesant and the other specialized schools aren't actually that great: ""I would not tell a top African-American student to go to one of those schools."" Rather, Noguera explained, he'd encourage such a student to attend a school that offered a more supportive environment and a higher quality of education. He told Capital that the specialized high schools offer ""a total sink-or-swim environment,"" which he would not hold up as a model. Noguera is exactly right. The politicians and the education experts who are so fixated on the racial balance at Stuyvesant neglect the fact that Stuyvesant is not built to support and nurture students who need care and attention to excel academically and socially. It is a school that allows ambitious students who know how to navigate their way around a maddening, complex bureaucracy to connect with other students with the same skill sets. Being in a fiercely competitive environment spurs a small number of sleep-deprived students to stretch themselves to the limit, to compete for admission to elite universities. The truth is that while Stuyvesant certainly does send many hyperaggressive students to the Stanfords and MITs and Princetons, students who find themselves in the bottom half of the class often languish without the support they'd get at other schools. Giving some number of black and Latino students a boost in the admissions process won't suddenly vault them into the top of the class or erase their need for a supportive environment. It is all too easy to imagine that the locus of segregation would simply shift. Stuyvesant High School as a whole might look more like New York City. But would the top quarter of the class look like it, or would it still be dominated by the kind of students who don't need a supportive environment to max out their GPAs? Like Noguera, I strongly suspect that the kind of very good black and Latino students who might be admitted to Stuyvesant if grades and attendance were taken into account would be better off elsewhere--and I think the same is probably true of many Asian and white students as well, if not most. Critics of Stuyvesant's demographic mix need to think hard about the goals of integration. Traditionally, desegregation efforts have been designed to get students from deprived backgrounds to rub shoulders with students from more affluent and stable families, in the hopes of fostering meaningful interracial friendships and spreading the norms that contribute to success later in life. In other words, integration is about helping students build social and cultural capital. Notice, however, that Stuyvesant has grown less and less white over the years. It's certainly not true that all white New Yorkers have more social and cultural capital than first- and second-generation Asian-Americans. As a general rule, however, native-born whites, and in particular rich native-born whites, tend to be more established in American society than recent arrivals from China's Fujian province or Bangladesh. So I find it striking that only 17 percent of admissions offers went to self-identified white students this year. Even if we add in the additional 8.3 percent of students who chose not to disclose their ethnic identities, many of whom, I'm guessing, were either white or of mixed ancestry, the total is a mere 25.3 percent. I have a theory about declining white representation at Stuyvesant. I seriously doubt that it's because New York City is no longer home to white eighth-graders from affluent families who have expansive vocabularies and solid critical thinking skills and who are more than capable of scoring well on the entrance exam. I've met more than my share of such young people. My gut tells me that Stuyvesant has grown steadily less attractive to white families with the kind of social and cultural capital that helps people get ahead in America. These families are seeking out other options, and so have savvy families of all ethnic backgrounds. Over the past three decades, New York's wealth boom has contributed to soaring endowments at the city's elite independent schools, virtually all of which are keen to attract talented black and Latino students and which obviously cater to academically gifted white students as well. More consequential still has been the rise of smaller public high schools, which offer well-defined curriculums that are a better fit for the large majority of students, gifted or otherwise, who need a bit of hand-holding. If you were a college-educated native-born parent living in New York who knows your way around the local high schools, is it obvious that you'd want your child to go to Stuyvesant instead of an excellent school with a mellow, hippie-ish vibe, or one that offers intensive instruction in Mandarin? Would it be obvious if it entailed a grueling commute, like the hour-and-a-half one-way commutes that were routine for friends of mine traveling from the far reaches of Staten Island, Queens, and the Bronx? It might have been obvious from the 1970s to the 1990s, when middle-class flight devastated the city's local high schools, and when getting your nerdy kid into a specialized high school was the only way to ensure that she wouldn't get beaten up every day at lunch. Fortunately, New York City has come a long way since then. There is another reason why in-the-know parents appear to be turning away from Stuyvesant. These days, it doesn't seem to be doing a good job of keeping its students on the ethical straight-and-narrow. In 2012, dozens of Stuyvesant students were caught cheating on a statewide Regents exam, the results of which were utterly inconsequential for the students involved. These were bright kids with bright futures, and they thought nothing of texting the questions on the (totally meaningless) Regents exam to their fellow students. The reporting that followed the scandal, from Vivian Yee of the New York Times and others, made it clear that this particular cheating incident was part of a larger pattern. The students involved in the scandal had grown so accustomed to cheating that it was second nature. And why wouldn't it be? When you get enough bright young people together and you tell them that academic achievement is everything but that you're going to load them with enough homework to last several lifetimes, it's inevitable that corners will be cut. Some will suggest that we simply transform Stuyvesant to address these concerns. Let's give it the same admissions process as Amherst College! Let's emphasize character education! Let's see to it that black and Latino representation never falls below 10 percent! But why bother? Such a radical overhaul wouldn't address the fundamental problem, which is the premise that New York City should have an elite high school--a ""crown jewel"" of the public school system--at all. As long as some people out there insist that Stuyvesant is the city's best school, and that its students are the best of the best, the fact that so few of its students are black and Latino is obviously going to offend people. How could it not? Instead of reinventing Stuyvesant from the ground up, we should instead recognize that it never made sense for one warehouse of a school to hoover up such a big chunk of the city's whiz kids. Better to spread gifted and talented kids across a wide range of schools offering different instructional models, each of which will do a better job of meeting their students' needs than a one-size-fits-all school like Stuyvesant, and none of which, hopefully, will pride itself on its ""eliteness."""

10	10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/07/child_migrant_crisis_obama_says_there_s_a_humanitarian_crisis_at_our_border.html	"Immigrant children continue to pour over the United States' southwestern border at a rate of more than 1,000 per week. President Obama is offering up a simple solution: Make it clear that if the unaccompanied children somehow survive the dangerous trip, the U.S. government will move as fast as it possibly can to send them back home to the countries they fled. That tough-love approach suggests that even though the president has taken to calling the influx of migrant children the ""humanitarian crisis on the border,"" in reality he believes it's better dealt with as an immigration issue as opposed to a refugee-like problem. The difference is more than semantics. If the president is right, his plan will stop or at least slow the influx of migrant kids that currently have ground much of the U.S. Border Patrol largely to a halt. But if he's wrong, as many immigration and child-rights advocates warn he is, the plan won't only fail to stem the tide, it could also place thousands of children in serious jeopardy. The exact details of what Obama's trumpeted as ""an aggressive deterrence strategy"" will be sent to Congress sometime this week, and come on the heels of the promise he made in the Rose Garden last week to go it alone on more sweeping immigration reform. The child-migrant proposal is expected to include compassionate measures--such as providing more resources to make life better for the tens of thousands of kids currently in government custody without a bed to sleep in. But the White House has made the centerpiece of the plan a change in immigration law to expedite the deportation process. Update July 8, 2014: The president sent a formal request to Congress on Tuesday for $3.7 billion to help deal with the crisis. That request--for nearly double the amount the White House had floated last week--does not include changes to current immigration law, but Obama made it clear in his letter to House Speaker John Boehner that he will push for related legislation that would rewrite the existing law to speed deportations. The tweak, if approved by Congress, would allow federal border patrol agents to quickly deport a migrant child if it isn't immediately obvious that he or she will likely be granted asylum of some kind. That is the system currently in place for children from Mexico or Canada, but not for those from countries that don't share a border with the United States, such as Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, which account for the bulk of the more than 50,000 children who have been apprehended at the border since October. Under the current system, Central American kids taken into custody by border patrol agents are handed over to the Department of Health and Human Services, which then finds them housing and takes responsibility for medical care while their cases wind through the immigration courts. The law, signed by George W. Bush, was designed to prevent children who are the victims of violence or human trafficking from being returned to the dangerous situation that they fled. But it has had two key unintended consequences, according to the White House: It puts massive stress on an already heavily taxed immigration system, and it gives the false impression to people in the most violent and impoverished countries that their children will be allowed to stay in the United States permanently, which further fuels the influx. Obama says that if parents knew for certain that their children would be sent home almost as soon as they arrived on U.S. soil, then they'd decide against sending their kids trekking across the Mexican desert in the first place. The president is betting that these families are choosing to have the children come--for reasons ranging from better jobs to reuniting with family--and not because they believe they have no other choice. And that's where the president's wrong, according to the plan's critics. ""These parents and kids say that they understand how horrible the trips will be--that they might be robbed of their money or sexually abused, that they'll be hungry and might die,"" says Karen Tumlin, the managing attorney at the National Immigration Law Center. ""And even after these kids get apprehended, they say they'd do it all again because of the violence and conditions in their home countries."" She and her fellow advocates argue that a parent who's willing to pay to send her child with a ""coyote"" to the United States has already decided that doing anything--no matter how great the risk or low the odds--is better than doing nothing. Obama's plan, critics say, won't change that equation. That might sound like bombast, but the limited available evidence supports it. Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador have been increasingly ravaged by gang violence and are among the most dangerous countries in the world. Honduras, which accounted for the highest number of unaccompanied minors apprehended at the border in the past three years, now has the highest murder rate in the world. And, as Vox recently pointed out, the murder rates in all three countries were so high in 2012 that someone living in one of them was, statistically speaking, more likely to be murdered than a civilian living in Iraq at the height of the war was to be killed. Children and teens face their own particular set of dangers given the prevalence and power of gangs back home. ""My grandmother wanted me to leave,"" a 17-year-old migrant from Honduras recently recounted to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. ""She told me: 'If you don't join, the gang will shoot you. If you do join, the rival gang will shoot you--or the cops will shoot you. But if you leave, no one will shoot you.' "" Another explained her reason for fleeing: ""In El Salvador they take young girls, rape them, and throw them in plastic bags."" Even assuming Obama's proposed change would convince families against sending their kids to the border, there's no guarantee that the message would ever reach Central America, where many households don't have television, let alone the Internet. Furthermore, there's evidence to suggest that those children who do make the trip, and the families who send them, are on some fundamental level accurately grasping our asylum law. The U.S. asylum process is complicated, but children can earn a number of special visas if they are believed to be victims of human trafficking or other crimes. According to a recent UNHCR estimate, more than one-half of the children arriving from Central America's Northern Triangle fled their home countries because they ""suffered or faced harms that indicated a potential or actual need for international protection."" Put another way, these children don't meet the technical definition of refugees under U.S. law because they are already on American soil when they're applying for asylum, but that doesn't mean they don't have a legal claim to refuge. ""The White House's proposal represents a lack of recognition that these kids are fleeing serious harm,"" says Megan McKenna, the director of advocacy and communications for Kids In Need of Defense, a nonprofit that arranges pro bono representation. ""It's unfairly limiting to look at this just as an immigration issue, and that's what the president is doing."" Regardless of whether Obama's plan works as intended, advocates fear kids in legitimate danger would be deprived of the protection they have a right to under U.S. law. ""We're not saying all of the children should stay,"" says McKenna, ""just that our laws say they should have meaningful representation and access to the system. [Obama's proposal] would end that."" The proposal faces an uncertain fate in Congress, where some Democrats will be wary of taking a vote designed to speed the deportation of children, and where Republicans currently threatening to sue Obama for executive overreach will likely have little interest in giving the president the additional power he's asking for. But even if lawmakers ultimately approve his proposal, there's plenty to suggest that the outcome might not be any better than the current unsustainable status quo."

It starts with a camera angled from the passenger side window of a truck, pointed at the namesake Japanese hybrid car. After 12 establishing seconds, the cameraman moves and points out the back window, where viewers can read the ominous decals: -PRIUS REPELLENT- At 23 seconds, the engine revs and the viewer finally learns what the arrows were pointing at. Smoke pours out of dual stacks, right in the path of the Prius, which retreats into the rear view. The truck's passengers share a well-earned chortle. ""Alright, enough!"" says one of them. ""You got 'im!"" says another. ""We got 'im!"" says a co-conspirator. ""Prius Repellent"" is a perfect introduction to one of the Obama era's great conservative subcultures: the men and women who ""roll coal."" For as little as $500, anyone with a diesel truck and a dream can install a smoke stack and the equipment that lets a driver ""trick the engine"" into needing more fuel. The result is a burst of black smoke that doubles as a political or cultural statement--a protest against the EPA, a ritual shaming of hybrid ""rice burners,"" and a stellar source of truck memes. The ""Prius repellent"" decal is easy to find on truck fan sites, as are memes of single or double stack trucks humiliating the drivers of smaller cars. There are videos of ""hot babes"" getting rolled on, and a mega-popular video (more than 3 million views) of an annoying Prius driver complaining about diesel. ""She makes me want to do a John Force style burn out right in front of her,"" observed one critic on DieselBurners.com. ""Rolling coal"" is not new. It grew out of the modifications people would do on their vehicles for truck pulls. It's just only recently entered the online culture wars. I'd seen the memes and a couple of the trucks. But I hadn't seen the left reply until this month, when Vocativ ran an expose of ""pollution porn for dudes with pickup trucks."" Progressives reacted with disbelief to Facebook communities like ""Rollin' COAL"" and (naturally) ""Prius Repellent,"" and to the sheer number of Instagram and Tumblr entries that recorded this stuff. They reacted with a mid-June surge of comments, sprinkled throughout these pages, all about the breeding patterns and penis sizes of the coal-rollers. The liberals seem a little surprised that conspicuous consumption--waste, even--could be a method of protest. They shouldn't be. The motivation for political coal rolling is roughly the same one that gets people buying guns and ammo after mass shootings. The expectation, every time, is that liberals will capitalize on the shootings to ban guns, so it's time to stock up. The use-it-before-liberals-ban-it instinct is powerful. Since 2007, environmental activists have campaigned for an ""Earth hour,"" 60 minutes in which people turn off all electricity. Since 2009, the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute has responded to this with Human Achievement Hour, a call to spend those same 60 minutes by keeping the lights on. ""Utilize something that requires energy to make,"" says Michelle Minton, director of ""sin industry"" studies at CEI. ""Make a phone call to someone you love. Have a beer."" The point is to expose how the people turning off electricity are just preening, when they have access to technology and medicine that the global poor are being denied. (One meme portrays the hermit state of North Korea at night, without any lights, in a state of ""permanent earth hour."") The greens, says Minton, ""are going to make it harder for us get to the next level of energy use. They're basically eliminating the garage team of scientists."" What about the push for calorie labeling, for smaller soda sizes, for mandatory calisthenics led by Michelle Obama? This, too, is being battled with conspicuous consumption. CEI, which gets some of its funding from the energy and food industries, has co-opted the Salvation Army's annual Doughnut Day as a time for ""patriotic civil disobedience."" To participate, eat two doughnuts. Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax reform throws a ""sin tax party,"" where guests can enjoy the spirits and foods being hit by higher taxes. An invitation to the 2012 party announced that guests could ""celebrate finally paying off the burden of government by enjoying these extra-taxed goods that bear the strain of the growing Nanny State."" But those are ideas germinated in the libertarian/conservative think tanks of Washington. Coal rolling is genuinely grassroots: No PR guru would come up with something like this. Despite the very public, check-this-out nature of coal rolling, the practitioners I talked to were sometimes reluctant to appear in the media. One big reason: The EPA was cracking down on devices that allowed truck drivers to remove diesel particulate filters. Coal rollers spoke in worried tones about Edge, the Utah company that took a $500,000 hit for selling more than 9,000 of the units, which allowed drivers to improve their mileage at the cost of tons of new particulate emissions. ""I talked to a guy today who was almost crying about it,"" one seller told me. ""He said, I only get 10-12 miles to a gallon now. Before the filter, I was getting 20 mpg, and a whole lot more horsepower."" Rolling coal is different and totally legal process from removing the filter. And yet it has everything to do with the EPA. It has everything to do with Obama. It has everything to do with the tax credits that go to hybrids and electric cars. ""I run into a lot of people that really don't like Obama at all,"" said one seller of stack kits from Wisconsin. ""If he's into the environment, if he's into this or that, we're not. I hear a lot of that. To get a single stack on my truck--that's my way of giving them the finger. You want clean air and a tiny carbon footprint? Well, screw you."" The lifestyle isn't for everyone. A couple of years ago, Sean Miller discovered that the high elevation of his Arizona county made his truck roll coal without any special modification. For a while, he uploaded videos of his towering ""hybrid repellant."" But the gimmick wore on him. He'd be driving, and the road behind him would fill with smoke. Conspicuous, yes, but after a while it got embarrassing. ""I know a lot of these guys thrive on how much coal they can roll when they're in town next to hybrid cars,"" said Miller. ""It's just a testosterone thing. It's manhood. It's who can blow the most smoke, whose is blacker. The blacker it is, the more fuel you have in your injectors. It was kind of fun. But I'll be honest with you. I decided I'd save some money. It's like throwing dollar bills out the window."" Boer Deng contributed reporting."

12	12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/07/obama_to_boehner_so_sue_me.html	"President Obama taunted Republicans on Tuesday. ""Middle-class families can't wait for Republicans in Congress to do stuff,"" he said. ""So sue me."" He was referring to House Speaker John Boehner's proposed lawsuit charging that Obama has overstepped his executive authority. ""As long as they're doing nothing, I'm not going to apologize for trying to do something,"" Obama added. The president spoke at the Key Bridge that connects Virginia to Washington to make a point about infrastructure legislation that is currently stuck in Congress. But the combative talk offers a good lens through which to view this year's midterm elections. If you work in the White House, you will think that ""so sue me"" is a great line. It is a punchy way to show the president fighting and engaged on behalf of the middle class, and it makes a point that Obama aides have been trying to make since the State of the Union: that House Republicans are engaged in meaningless votes to repeal Obamacare, endless hearings, and now a lawsuit all to score political points, while the president is straining every muscle to work for the middle class. If the election becomes a referendum on an unpopular president, that's bad for Democrats. This construction asks voters--particularly the handful who will vote but remain undecided--to compare the president's efforts to the even more unpopular Republicans in Congress. If you are a Republican, you also will think that ""so sue me"" is a great line, but for obviously different reasons. Boehner baited the president with the lawsuit, and the president bit. What better way to keep your motivated and angry voters with red in their eyes than this fresh example of Obama's defiant arrogance? But if you are a Democratic candidate in one of the crucial states that will determine whether Republicans take control of the Senate, it's not clear what to make of all this. On one hand, Democrats need motivation, so a pitched battle between the president and the Republican House reminds voters what the election is about--candidates fighting for the middle class versus partisan Republicans. It also makes the fight personal: Democrats are more likely to have Obama's back if they're properly focused with him as the targeted party. On the other hand, this taunt is more likely to motivate the Republican base than Democratic voters. The anger at Obama that motivates Republican voters is a more powerful force than the threat of a Republican majority or promise of legislation that might help the middle class, both of which are possible election outcomes that might motivate Democratic voters. If you're an endangered Democrat this cycle, you probably live in one of the seven states in play that Obama lost to Romney, which means the field is already tilted against you. Plus, there's always the danger that a national debate about the president and what he has and hasn't done distracts from your effort to keep the race about local issues and the weakness of your opponent. There has been some speculation on the right that the president is checked out. That doesn't seem to be true, as much as it feels like he's run out of options to make much progress on many issues. But his aides are trying hard--with events like the one in front of the Key Bridge on Tuesday--to show that the president is still out there battling every day. The lawsuit works in this way for the White House, too: Obama is so active that it's enough to launch a lawsuit! In the end, ""so sue me"" might become shorthand for the dysfunctional relationship between the president and Congress that has been a central part of his presidency. If so, the location was unintentionally perfect. The Key Bridge is often seized with unimaginable gridlock, from which it seems like you'll never escape."

13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/07/immigration_reform_is_dead_what_are_obama_s_options_now.html	"It was fitting that the fate of immigration reform was sealed at a golf event: Both are interests shared by Barack Obama and John Boehner, but they'll be neither golfing nor reforming immigration together anytime soon. Before a ceremony honoring the winners of the Presidents Cup, the House speaker relayed to the president that he was not going to schedule an immigration vote. The issue has been dead all year, but this put the headstone in the grass. The death of immigration reform comes at a time when John Boehner is suing the president for exceeding his executive authority. The two are linked. Boehner and other House Republican leaders who want immigration reform say they couldn't pass anything, because their conference could never believe in a president who oversteps his authority so regularly. Why would the guy who ignored provisions in his health care law when it was politically convenient remain bound to the strict border-enforcement promises that would be required of any immigration reform that could get through the House? ""The American people and their elected officials don't trust [the president] to enforce the law as written,"" said Speaker Boehner. ""Until that changes, it is going to be difficult to make progress on this issue."" Boehner may have a case to make about executive overreach. We'll see when he releases his legislation initiating the suit later this month. But that's not what killed immigration reform. Internal conflicts within the GOP over the issue did. By making Obama overreach the sole reason for the death of immigration reform, the speaker risks making a legitimate grievance seem political and adaptable to any occasion. Got a leaky roof? Blame Obama overreach. In conversations over the last few months with Republican senators and congressmen trying to reform the immigration system, opposition within conservative ranks emerged as the No. 1 reason for the lack of progress and dismal outlook for reform. No one wanted to have the internal political fight and risk alienating motivated grassroots voters in a year when Republicans have a chance of winning back control of the Senate. The fear of a backlash from those voters is what Boehner himself referred to in a video where he mocked the political fear of some of his members. Part of the backlash would have come from the fact that any legislation that became law would have required making a deal with a president who conservatives distrust, but on immigration reform, they didn't trust other Republicans either. The voters of the 7th District in Virginia certainly didn't trust Eric Cantor. Proof of conservative distrust in Republicans was also evident last summer in the widespread opposition to the Senate immigration legislation. The bill, passed with 14 Republican votes after an amendment by Republican Sens. Bob Corker and John Hoeven, secured increased funding and promises for border security. Immigration-reform skeptics challenged the provision--which was meant to give political cover to Republicans--and made the legislation dead on arrival in the House. The president's response to the death of reform in the House was to announce that he will take whatever executive actions possible. This ends an experiment in restrained presidential leadership. President Obama had not been making a showy push for immigration reform in part because Boehner, among others, had advised him that Republicans would have a harder time supporting anything the president championed too strongly. One House leadership aide says Obama kept his promise on immigration, but it was action on those other issues that made conditions too toxic. Now Obama is stuck between trying to lead and facing accusations of going beyond his office. In this moment of peak partisanship, a president faced with an opposition party in Congress can only achieve his objectives by pressing the boundaries of his office. The opposition party in Congress, with fewer members who share policy agreements with the president, is less willing to overlook infractions and benefits from crying foul more than ever. As John Hudak of the Brookings Institution points out, Obama's ability to go it alone now is limited. He can move some money from existing accounts to the border to deal with the recent influx of thousands of Central American children. Republicans say that the crisis is the result of just the kind of power move they're angry about. In a previous executive action, Obama granted children of undocumented immigrants a temporary reprieve from deportation, which gave false hope to the children flocking to the border. (Those children are not eligible for protection, and the president has vowed to return them to their home countries.) The president has tasked the lawyers at the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security to come up with ideas for other actions he might take. If their responses are anything like the unilateral actions on school construction, the minimum wage, or manufacturing that have been a part of Obama's so-called ""year of action,"" they will be modest because the president is constrained by existing statutes. They will do very little to move Obama toward his larger immigration policy goals. The president's actions on immigration will hardly fit the ""aggressive unilateralism"" that Boehner accuses him of in his statement announcing his lawsuit. President Obama has said that Speaker Boehner's lawsuit is a stunt, so he likely won't worry about mounting a serious defense. But if he wanted to get the suit thrown out on the grounds that arguments about presidential overreach are purely political, he could cite the collapse of immigration reform as Exhibit A."

For those of you who don't know, the U.S. violently seized much of its territory from our neighbors to the south in the mid-19th century. That's the kind of thing that leads to hard feelings. Mexico has, to be sure, shot itself in the foot in all kinds of ways. Yet it's fair to say that Yankee imperialism has had a powerful influence on Mexico's evolution, and not always for the better. It is doubly awkward, then, that the United States now needs Mexico to come to its rescue. Specifically, the United States needs Mexico's help to deal with the ongoing child migrant crisis at our mutual border. President Obama is insisting that something be done. Congressional Republicans are doing the same. I would be shocked if something weren't done in the relatively near future. My concern is that the something in question will do nothing to address the reason we're facing a child migrant crisis. And Mexico is the only country big enough, rich enough, and close enough to the heart of this humanitarian catastrophe to make a real difference. Thus far, Mexico has barely entered the conversation. Rather, the debate has centered on whether Guatemalans, Hondurans, and Salvadorans have been led to believe that the Obama administration will welcome unaccompanied Central American minors, or whether the violence in those countries is so extreme that it would be irresponsible to send them home. For Guatemalans, Hondurans, and Salvadorans to make it to the United States at all, though, they must first cross Mexican territory. In an ideal world, Central Americans fleeing chaos at home could find refuge in Mexico--one of the world's more prosperous countries, and one of the richest in Latin America. Indeed, in 2011 Mexico enacted a refugee law that is in many respects more generous than the laws on the books in the United States, though it's not at all clear that this law bears any resemblance to what's happening on the ground. Some Central Americans would, of course, still want to make the trek to the United States even if Mexico offered them refuge, either to reunite with loved ones or to find more lucrative work. But that's not really the issue at hand. Mexico, thankfully, is far safer and more stable than the countries to its south. If it is incapable of providing refuge to those truly in need, it would nevertheless be much better for the United States for migrants to be vetted on Mexican soil than in a chaotic scrum at the U.S.-Mexico border. The trouble is that getting to this point will require a level of trust and cooperation that the United States and Mexico have rarely achieved. In theory, the U.S. and Mexico should be as thick as thieves. There are approximately 11.7 million Mexican-born immigrants currently residing in the United States. In case you're keeping score, that is 29 percent of America's entire immigrant population and 4 percent of its population overall. Roughly twice as many native-born Americans identify as being of Mexican origin, which means that there are about as many Mexican-Americans in the United States as there are African-Americans. Of course, this Mexicanization of America hasn't been embraced by everyone, for reasons good and bad. And Mexico's government has, in defending the rights of its migrants--including its many unauthorized migrants--taken an at times adversarial stance toward the United States. But the relationship between the U.S. and Mexico is entering a new phase. Migration from Mexico to the U.S. has slowed sharply in recent years, and not primarily due to more aggressive border enforcement. Rather, it's because Mexico's GDP per capita has reached $15,600, which places it in roughly the same ballpark as moderately well-off countries like Russia, Malaysia, and Turkey. This is still substantially lower than America's GDP per capita ($52,800), and this gap remains big enough to tempt Mexican workers northward. Yet as Mexico's standard of living improves, its citizens are less eager to leave their families and neighborhoods behind. Slowly but surely, Mexico is transitioning from being a country that people are desperate to leave behind to a country that people are desperate to reach. Mexicans and Americans, then, have a shared interest in tackling the child migrant crisis at its source. Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador have been plagued for years by extreme poverty, gang violence, and general lawlessness. Economic development is the only reliable way to reduce migrant outflows. Once a country's GDP per capita passes $8,000 or so, adjusted for purchasing power, its residents become far less inclined to leave the country. Before this threshold is reached, rising income can actually spur more migration, presumably because it gives truly impoverished people the means to pack up and leave. Right now, Guatemala ($5,300), Honduras ($4,800), and El Salvador ($7,500) are right in that zone. But they are close enough to the threshold that we can realistically imagine a world in which Central Americans see rising prosperity at home as a realistic possibility. One widely held view is that the best thing we can do for Central America is allow its people to work in the U.S., so they can then send money back home. But is that really true? The best evidence we have suggests that remittances don't do much to stimulate economic growth in source countries. This shouldn't come as too much of a surprise, as rising remittances reflect the rising migration of able-bodied working adults, who are no longer available to boost economic output back home. It turns out that raising living standards is not the quite same as raising living standards in a sustainable, durable way. Mailing checks to an economically unviable village can help prop things up for a while, but what happens when the checks stop coming--when your migrant relative forms a family in El Norte, or when the ties that bind are no longer so binding? Even if the checks keep coming, there is a danger that the money will drive up prices for scarce goods like productive agricultural land, as anthropologist David Stoll has observed. This puts families without migrant relatives at a distinct disadvantage compared with those that do. The result is that migration begets more migration until a region is drained of all its go-getters. Raising living standards by raising earnings in the region itself, in contrast, doesn't depend on relatives or friends living far from home. It means acquiring skills and producing goods and services that are worth real money. The U.S. and Mexico can help this process along by making a sustained commitment to improving the quality of government and infrastructure in the region. Migration can surely play a role in bettering the lives of Central Americans. It's just not clear that it is the distant United States that should absorb the bulk of Central America's migrants. Mexico has now become prosperous enough, and its population is aging quickly enough, that it needs to consider welcoming more immigrants itself. The beauty of Mexico as a destination for Central American workers is that its cultural familiarity and geographical proximity, coupled with the more modest gap in living standards between Mexico and its Central American neighbors, will help ensure that migrants retain strong ties to their native countries. Mexico can't be expected to carry the burden of welcoming large numbers of Central American migrants on its own. Though it has joined the ranks of affluent countries, and though it is reasonable to expect that Mexico and the U.S. will serve as partners in lifting up their neighbors, Mexico is still much poorer than the U.S. Right now, the U.S. devotes considerable resources to fighting organized crime in Mexico and Central America, most of which is connected to the trafficking of drugs and the smuggling of human beings. The U.S. should consider devoting more resources still to help Mexico process migrants and asylum seekers, and to help those who remain in Mexico build decent lives. That sort of investment makes sense for the United States, for Mexico, and for Central America. The sooner we all understand that, the better it will be for everyone.

17	17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/07/arizona_immigration_checkpoint_criticism_border_patrol_harasses_people_and.html	"ARIVACA, Ariz.--Carlota Wray squints against a sharp afternoon sun and navigates her pickup along Arivaca Road's jutting curves and over rattling metal cattle guards. Wray, 56, has been driving this route, in and out of the valley between Arivaca and the rest of Arizona, for nearly her entire adult life. She has nothing to hide--not underneath her blue sweater vest or in the panels of the car. Wray became a U.S. citizen in 2008 after years of permanent residency. Yet she still cleans out her car every time she sets off toward Tucson. She has to cross a checkpoint and will have to defend what she will never be able to conceal: her Mexican roots. ""I know that Border Patrol abuse Latinos, people with brown skin, as beautiful as God made us,"" she says. ""I see that my friends, my family are questioned and judged without reason, just for being Latino. They ask questions that are not necessary, but I am not doing anything wrong."" The speed limit drops to 35 mph, the first warning of the upcoming checkpoint. All vehicles must stop. Drivers must use low beams. Wray pulls up along a string of neon-orange cones. ""Slow down, slow down,"" she says. ""Hmm. I don't see anybody. Today might be a lucky day. I don't see anybody. Maybe they are in the car? Oh, there they are."" A stocky uniformed man emerges from a shaded hut on the edge of the road and crosses to Wray's window. ""How you doing?"" he says, peering into the pickup. ""Doing good,"" she says. ""U.S. citizens here?"" the Border Patrol agent questions. ""U.S. citizens,"" Wray says. The agent nods, steps back and beckons us onward. Wray exhales deeply, loosens her grip on the steering wheel, and presses on the gas. A frontier war is being waged in southern Arizona, but it's many miles north of the Mexico border. People are fed up with the immigration checkpoints. A round-the-clock U.S. Border Patrol presence at the checkpoints means that American citizens must endure inspection when they commute to work or run errands; every major road has one of these blockades. Arizona may seem like an unlikely place for a backlash against immigration enforcement. The state is home to many aggressive immigration policies, like the controversial SB 1070 law, which gives Arizona police the right to demand citizenship papers from anyone they suspect is not in the U.S. legally. And recently Arizona residents have been protesting the arrival of undocumented children, some of the more than 52,000 unaccompanied minors who began to cross the border since October 2013, prompting President Barack Obama to declare a humanitarian crisis. Checkpoints deep inside the United States are inconceivable for most Americans who live far from the southwest. They are unknown even to some prominent immigration activists like Jose Antonio Vargas, an undocumented immigrant who was briefly detained at an interior checkpoint in Texas. The Arizona checkpoints started springing up suddenly in early 2007 when Congress funded them after years of resistance from an Arizona politician. The checkpoints seem incongruous with a Western frontier ethos that equates open roads and fast cars with personal freedom. ""We are not accustomed to having a military checkpoint. It is common in other countries, but Americans have never had to live with that as a permanent way of life before,"" says Leesa Jacobson, a co-founder of an anti-checkpoint community movement People Helping People in the Border Zone, based in Arivaca (population 700). Parallel anti-checkpoint movements are drawing an odd collection of bedfellows--conservative ranchers, comfortable retirees, reclusive libertarians, and liberal activists--who are linked by one basic contention. Because American citizens can be randomly detained and searched at interior checkpoints deep inside the United States, the checkpoints undermine the tenets of a free, democratic society. The exact number of interior checkpoints across the southwest isn't easy to estimate. Some pop up and disappear on short notice. The Department of Homeland Security stopped releasing official numbers in 2008. The total number of interior checkpoints on the U.S.-Mexico and U.S.-Canada border areas may exceed 100, according to the Arizona Republic. In southern Arizona, there are at least 11, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, and they're all positioned about 25 miles to 50 miles north of Mexico. The checkpoints operate round-the-clock, year-round as part of a border security strategy to apprehend undocumented migrants, stop illicit drugs and arms, and catch terrorists. There is no uniform protocol or agreed law about what Border Patrol agents may do when they stop a motorist at an interior checkpoint. The most commonly cited Supreme Court decision defining the rights of citizens and police is almost four decades old. The high court held in the 1976 case of U.S. v. Martinez-Fuerte that Border Patrol agents could ""briefly question"" all drivers about their citizenship at checkpoints and possibly request a form of identification, even ""in the absence of any individualized suspicion,"" but only at ""reasonably located checkpoints."" Neither the vehicle nor its occupants should be searched without probable cause. The federal government maintains that its agents have the right to ask drivers anything and physically search a vehicle, even if the driver is a U.S. citizen, because the Supreme Court held that ""we can have checkpoints and they are not unreasonable,"" says Shevannah Wray (no relation to Carlota Wray), a public affairs official for U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The same case is cited in arguments that Border Patrol is exceeding its legal mandate. ""Basically it is clear [that it is OK for Border Patrol] to ask a few questions related to verifying the citizenship of a person, so long as the stop is not reasonably prolonged,"" says James Duff Lyall, an ACLU of Southern Arizona staff attorney based in Tucson. ""But what questions can they ask, really? What is unreasonably prolonged? Do you have to provide ID? That is not totally clear to me.""* In January the ACLU submitted an administrative complaint on behalf of 15 individuals to the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General and Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. The letter details alleged violations of U.S. citizens' constitutional rights at six interior federal immigration checkpoints in Arizona. Most of the complainants say they were never questioned about their citizenship--the alleged purpose of the checkpoints--but were detained for a half hour or more for refusing to consent to an unwarranted search or for asking why they were being detained. One complainant says an officer drew a gun. The ACLU also filed a lawsuit against DHS in April demanding immediate release of all records related to Border Patrol's ""extensive but largely opaque"" interior enforcement operations in Tucson and Yuma patrol sectors. The federal agency responded in early July denying a release of the records. The case will now be brought to a U.S. District Court at the end of August. Lyall says the ACLU will not limit its focus to interior checkpoints in Arizona but will examine those in other states as well. Many residents of Mexican origin believe they are routinely profiled when they are stopped at a checkpoint and asked to present identification. ""I've become so accustomed to it I don't really pay attention to it anymore,"" says Edith Cortez, a 26-year-old Mexican-American who lives in Sierra Vista, a city of about 40,000 that hugs two checkpoints. ""I got questioned this one time, like 'Is everybody a U.S. citizen? Are you sure?' It was funny, like, just because of the way I look? You want to see my documentation? Go ahead."" Yet the questions can sometimes range far afield: Did you cross into Mexico today? Are you the owner of this car? What kind of mileage does this car get? Where are you from? Where do you live? Where do you work? Not everyone will answer. Some lone dissenters are choosing to take the risk of remaining silent. Terry Bressi of the University of Arizona works on a mountain that towers more than 6,800 feet above the southern Arizona desert. He is a chief engineer for the Kitt Peak National Observatory, where he searches the nighttime sky for asteroids that could collide with the Earth. When Bressi travels home to Tucson, he must cross a federal immigration checkpoint on state Route 86, about 40 miles north of Mexico. He does not like it. But the checkpoint is unavoidable, so Bressi prepares for the encounter. He fastens six palm-sized video cameras onto the dashboard and rear window of his blue pickup. ""I am just a few miles outside of Three Points, Arizona,"" he dictates into a recorder as he rolls down the mountain. ""Uh, this particular checkpoint has been in place since early January 2008, and I have been documenting my experiences as I drive back and forth."" Bressi has driven through the Route 86 fixed checkpoint about 350 times over the past six years and has never once rolled down his window to answer U.S. Border Patrol agents. His defiance has cost him thousands of dollars to fight traffic citations and a civil rights lawsuit. He approaches the checkpoint, easing off the gas and gliding toward a line of Border Patrol vehicles. An agent approaches the truck, appears to recognize Bressi and retreats to confer with a colleague. He returns and silently waves him forward. The Border Patrol has developed a protocol for handling motorists like Bressi. An agent will signal to a colleague and call out something like, ""Hey guys, we are going to have an uncooperative motorist."" Backup agents are always nearby and usually help defuse the situation. ""It is not worth it to have the confrontation. We are seeing a lot more of these folks than we used to,"" says the Interstate 19 checkpoint's chief agent. (He asked not to be named because of security concerns. He looks to the hovering Santa Rita Mountains just north of the border, where he says the Mexican Sinaloa trafficking cartel lurks.) Bressi posts videos of his checkpoint drive-throughs on his YouTube channel, CheckpointUSA.   Bressi says YouTube has deleted a handful of the most dramatic videos, which he had used as evidence in his five settled and dismissed checkpoint court actions, charges for infractions like failure to obey an officer while directing traffic. Bressi suspects that a third-party complaint from Customs and Border Protection is to blame for YouTube's removal of some of his videos. There are a few other people like Bressi across the southwest: white, middle-aged men who keep steady jobs, are American citizens, and feel secure enough to routinely take a stand against checkpoints. ""I am not politically active,"" says Richard Rynearson during a Skype call from South Korea. ""I am a military officer, and I took an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States from foreign and domestic enemies. When I am deployed I focus on foreign enemies, and when I am here, I focus on the domestic ones.""* Rynearson, a major in the U.S. Air Force, is suing Border Patrol agents in Uvalde County, Texas, following a prolonged detention in 2010 at a checkpoint 67 miles north of the Mexico border. The detention and standoff with a Border Patrol agent landed him disciplinary action at work. The simpler option for drivers is to comply with all requests. Conflict over interior checkpoints in Arizona began in the mid-1990s. Then-Rep. Jim Kolbe, a Republican, helped block funding for permanent checkpoints within Arizona, considering it tactically foolish to place them far away from the actual border. But with Kolbe's departure from office in 2007, the House of Representatives adopted appropriations language that approved funding for fixed interior checkpoints. * * * Retirees once flocked to Tubac for the year-round good weather, affordable adobe-style homes, and quaint outdoor shopping pavilions. But the checkpoint on I-19, a five-minute drive from town, has harmed real estate prices, according to a February 2013 study. Business owners also reported a decline following the construction of the checkpoint. The Santa Cruz Valley Citizens Council is bringing a petition to close the checkpoint to Tubac's chamber of commerce this summer. It plans to push the letter forward to lobby state representatives. So far, the council has received signatures of about 600 of the town's population of 1,000. Residents tell stories of drug mules passing through their backyards to avoid the checkpoint, walking in long lines down the streets. A high-speed car chase between a Border Patrol agent and migrants with a chaperoning coyote spilled over onto a pristine golf course in 2012. This is all a part of what locals call the checkpoint ""fanning out"" effect: Undocumented or possibly dangerous smugglers, rebuffed by checkpoints, filter out into surrounding communities. It is unclear how truly effective the interior checkpoints or throngs of Border Patrol agents are at thwarting illegal activity. A few undocumented Mexican immigrants living in Winchester Heights, Arizona, told me they walked undetected across the border and around interior checkpoints a few years ago. It was not very difficult to travel on alternate dirt paths. Customs and Border Protection has gaps in its information about checkpoints that it needs to address, according to the U.S. Government and Accountability Office. It does not track data at individual checkpoints--only large regional sectors, which include border ports of entry. Nor do agents monitor how many cars pass through a checkpoint on a given day, says the chief of the I-19 stop. On a Monday afternoon between 11 a.m. and 11:30 a.m., I counted 206 cars passing through the I-19 checkpoint, each stopped by two Border Patrol agents. Thirty-eight of these drivers were questioned for at least 30 seconds and presented a form of identification. Only two or three of these drivers appeared to be light-skinned and fair-haired, as opposed to the overwhelming majority of these 38 drivers, who had brown hair and darker skin. Within this period, nine drivers were asked to pull over into a secondary area, all of whom drove a truck or van. The People Helping People movement in Arivaca is currently sorting through data that community members have collected over the past few months on the profiles of motorists passing through the Arivaca Road checkpoint, located about 25 miles north of the Mexico border. The I-19 chief says he is always looking three cars behind the one in front of him at the checkpoint, on alert for any strange, nervous behavior, like a jiggling leg, or a set of fingers drumming repeatedly against the steering wheel. But agents never stop people because they look as if they could have been born in Mexico or another part of Latin America, says Customs and Border Protection's Shevannah Wray. ""That would be racism,"" she says. * * * Undocumented Latinos organize their lives around the checkpoints, which now intercept every major road in southern Arizona. Laura Lopez (her name has been changed to protect her identity) has lived in Douglas, Arizona, since 1988. She cannot go north of Sierra Vista on state Route 90 because she will encounter a checkpoint and may be questioned about her citizenship. She cannot travel northwest on state Route 80, past Tombstone, because there, too, she will meet another checkpoint. There are more checkpoints along U.S. 191, near Elfrida, and east, heading toward New Mexico, on Route 80. Lopez spends her days knitting or doing laundry. She cooks, mashing habanero chilies into fresh red salsa. She talks on the phone to the three of her five children who have been deported, one by one, back to Mexico, leaving the family half in the United States, half out, trapped between interior checkpoints. ""Now you cannot move to another part or travel around,"" she says. ""You begin to feel trapped because you cannot go out much. I cannot go to Mexico and I cannot go north. For me, this is very sad."" Going back to Mexico would mean abandoning her younger children and husband, who are American citizens, and could place her health in jeopardy. Lopez was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer in 2009. It can be a struggle to find medical programs specifically for women's health in Sierra Vista, says Julie Encinas, a women's health case manager at Chiricahua Community Health Center. The low-cost clinic tries to refer its mostly Latino patients to doctors on the same side of the checkpoints. ""If we refer someone elsewhere, we always ask, 'Can you get there, is there anything that can keep you from getting there?' "" says Jane Davenport, a nurse practitioner who works for the Chiricahua Health Center's Douglas mobile branch. ""A handful of people have said, 'No, but we will get there,' meaning they will just take a chance."" Lopez is one of the patients who took a chance and accepted a ride from family friends to Phoenix. She cried throughout the one-hour drive until they approached an Army green-clad Border Patrol agent under the checkpoint's white arch. He asked where they were going and where they were coming from. Lopez, in the backseat, quietly listened to the conversation. It played out in Spanish, the only language she speaks. ""They spoke to him like family, my friends. They said 'Hijo, we are coming from Douglas and we are going to Tucson.' He said 'OK' and then we passed,"" she says, exhaling deeply. ""Thank God it was easy. Because of my health, my children and everything, my husband."" Lopez's cancer is in remission. She worries that it will return or complications from diabetes will require another journey to Phoenix. For now, Lopez is stuck in her house, measuring out pills that prevent her blood sugar from spiking. * * * The checkpoint fighters in Arizona rage against several targets. There is the Border Patrol, swelling in its ranks and funding, facing accounts of corruption and poor treatment of civilians. There are the failed efforts at border security and immigration reform.  And then there are the actual checkpoints themselves: The insecure shacks that must be shuttered during summer storms, and the hulking, white arches that provide relief for the K-9s during hot afternoons. These fixtures remain largely outside of Arizona and national politics, says an adviser to Arizona Rep. Raul Grijalva, in part because of how they contradict political ideologies. The opposition is not led by liberals or conservatives or defined by their traditional leanings. The ire is localized and yet transcendent, passing from car to car on Arizona roads. Crossing an interior immigration checkpoint in Arizona is a puzzling experience. A curious visitor from a peaceful foreign country driving around the state who happened upon a checkpoint for the first time might well wonder, on the basis of the cursory questions and inspections, why, exactly, the checkpoints are present. Visitors from countries wracked by military rule, coups, or civil wars, where checkpoints are routine instruments of control--and sometimes sites of violence and extortion--might feel more at home. When an agent gives the OK--a nod, a ""have a good day, now""--a traveler cannot help but feel a surge of virtue or a rush of relief. Arivaca seems an unlikely place for an effective checkpoint resistance movement to take hold. The town is a dot on a map, nestled in the desert 14 miles north of Mexico. A community office along the town's dusty main street collects complaints from checkpoint crossers. As soon as the office first opened in 2012, people started coming by to ""say something terrible happened with Border Patrol at the checkpoint,"" recalls Sophie Smith, 27, one of the co-founders of the office. The reports poured in, revolving around prolonged detentions, abusive language, and physical force. Border Patrol agents work 8- to 10-hour shifts and rotate checkpoint locations every few days. That makes it difficult for them to recognize and wave through local residents who regularly pass through checkpoints, as the somewhat speculative Supreme Court ruling from 1976 originally contemplated. The agents themselves can be on edge. There is a ""100 percent chance"" of injury on the job, says an agent at the Arivaca Road checkpoint who asks not to be identified for security reasons. It is just a matter of whether you will be run over by a car, or attacked by a criminal who discovers where you live, he says. ""I've arrested maybe 20,000 over the past 10 years and some of those people have been apprehended, what, once, two times?"" he says. ""They remember my face. I don't remember theirs. They could find me. Show up at my home, find my family."" About a third of Arivaca residents have signed a petition to close the checkpoint. Carlota Wray is one of them. Over a meal of fresh tamales at her relatives' house, Wray's brother-in-law, Manuel Leyva, a legal permanent resident in the United States, surprises her by saying he has no problem with Border Patrol agents sometimes questioning his 14-year-old daughter, an American citizen, at the Arivaca Road checkpoint and asking for her passport. ""We are taught to respect the authorities and to respect men in uniform in Mexico,"" he says. Later, on the way home, Wray muses in the quiet of the dark car. Her thoughts drift to one April evening in 2012. She and her oldest daughter, Yolanda, were rushing her elderly mother to the hospital in Tucson. Wray had obtained a short-term visa for her mother, a Mexican citizen, whose liver was failing. They paused at the checkpoint and rolled down the window to greet a Border Patrol agent. ""This man, he asked if I was a citizen and the words did not come and he looked at me, and I looked at him, and he saw my tears come, and it was this awful moment,"" says Wray. ""He asked me, 'Where are you going? Where are you taking her?' All I could think about was my mother. It was an awful intrusion."" Wray attends anti-checkpoint meetings regularly, but Yolanda never does. ""Yolanda has an attitude like, 'If you behave well, then they will treat you well,' "" Wray says from the car. ""She and my granddaughter have become accustomed to it. That is a bad idea."" Wray now nears the checkpoint, for the second time today. White fluorescent lights towering overhead cast beams inside her Dodge. She catches a glimpse of Border Patrol's foldout chairs near a white trailer. No agents emerge. She keeps on driving toward Arivaca, and the checkpoint gradually falls out of view.

18	18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/07/zephyr_teachout_and_tim_wu_s_bid_against_new_york_governor_andrew_cuomo.html	"NEW YORK--The Staten Island Democratic Association meets every month at Karl's Klipper, a seafood joint just a few blocks from the ferry, where the management is thoughtful enough to provide presidential-themed placemats. Tonight's meeting will start early because a candidate for governor--someone named Zephyr Teachout--has to be right in and right out. ""This is the guy running against the governor?"" asks Marie Dwyer, the association's secretary. ""Zephyr, you know, it sounds like one of those names the hippies gave out in the '70s,"" says a retiree, poking through his tuna melt. Wrong, and--well, not wrong, although a glance at the candidate essay and photo provided at the meeting could have solved the gender conundrum. When Teachout arrives, clad in a yellow business suit and trailed by one aide, she works the room and apologizes for her roughened vocal chords. ""I'll speak for five or 10 minutes and take your questions,"" she says. The bar blares '90s radio rock. An errant radio is playing the All-Star game. Teachout rolls with it. Still, some of her lines are greeted with polite, blank looks. ""A lot of the people supporting our campaign are inventors and entrepreneurs,"" she says. ""The founder of a thing called Wordpress. A CEO of Digg. These are high-tech companies that see that New York's future will depend in part on whether we make this state more amenable for small businesses."" Then she starts talking about how to do that--education spending, more rails, a better MTA, a ban on fracking, a gay and transgender rights bill. The chatter slows, then stops. Teachout has the room. ""I supported Gov. Cuomo four years ago,"" says Teachout. ""I believed in him. I actually even tried to volunteer for him. He said he was going to clean up Albany. He said he was going to veto gerrymandered districts. I believed that he was going to fight for Democratic senators and a Democratic Senate. And having grown up loving Mario Cuomo, with a Time magazine with his picture on the cover hanging in my bedroom, I believed that he was going to fight for traditional Democratic values. I have been so disappointed."" Teachout is Gov. Andrew Cuomo's avowedly progressive primary challenger, in a year when few Democrats are sweating the left flank. No red state Democratic senator--not even the ones who broke with the party on immigration or gun safety--drew a 2014 primary challenger. No Democrat is seriously organizing to challenge Hillary Clinton's expected presidential bid. Cuomo, who dismisses Teachout as an avatar for the ""extreme left,"" has raised $35 million for his re-election bid. Teachout has raised $277,360. But she's running, and she's running avowedly to force Cuomo to the left. Teachout was the director of Internet organizing for Howard Dean's 2004 presidential bid, the great lost cause that adopted then empowered the liberal ""netroots."" Dean's campaign changed the boundaries of the debate in the Democratic Party. The 2006 primary defeat of Sen. Joe Lieberman cemented those changes. But there's been no great shift since then, and Teachout frames the New York race as a guilt-free, risk-free chance to move the party left. ""I think it's time to have a Democrat in the Democratic primary for governor in the Democratic state of New York,"" Teachout says in Staten Island. ""We know who Gov. Cuomo thinks he can take for granted, which is Democrats, and who he thinks he needs to play to, which is the Republicans."" The story of ""Andrew Cuomo, closet right-winger"" is well-known among progressives and obscure for everybody else. Cuomo won an easy 2010 race against one of the year's most self-destructive Tea Party candidates, and when he's made national news, he's done it by driving left. He signed gay marriage into law. He signed a gun safety bill. He warned ""extreme conservatives"" not to waste their time in New York, which made him a dunk-tank villain on Fox News. Polls give the governor supermajority support from self-identified Democrats. Progressives, Teachout especially, didn't think the other Cuomo story was getting told. Cuomo had spent his tenure working with a Republican state Senate--in marked contrast to former Democratic Gov. Eliot Spitzer--and giving school boards less than they asked for while proposing property and estate tax cuts. After his lieutenant governor bowed out, he chose former Rep. Kathy Hochul as a running mate--Hochul, who had won a tough western New York district by running to the center, Hochul who even took credit for quashing a bill that would have given driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants. That tore it. The Hochul choice was enough to get Tim Wu, the net neutrality advocate and legal theorist (and sometime Slate contributor), to join Teachout on her ticket. ""Cuomo wants to win by some massive margin, to prove that he's a national candidate,"" says Wu. ""That's why he picked Hochul. He wants to be what Chris Christie used to be known as. I just don't think that's a responsible way to govern the state. There's a battle going on for the heart and soul of the Democratic Party right now, and there are some deep ideological divides that sometimes we paper over because there's a Democratic president. On immigration, I think we should be having an open debate in the party."" So far, it's almost working--and ironically, that may be due to an early setback for the progressives. Teachout entered the race days before the Working Families Party convention, where activists would determine the progressive third party's ballot line. She'd been approached to run months earlier, at a time when polls suggested that a WFP candidate could pull a quarter of the vote. All of it would come from Cuomo's left. Any of it would cost Cuomo him his expected landslide. Too much of it would elect a Republican governor. The progressives were cut off at the pass. Cuomo scrambled, cutting a video to court the WFP endorsement, then cutting another to make sure the details were right. The governor who'd already been making election-year deals with labor unions made specific concessions to the left. Deny Teachout the WFP line, and he'd try to elect a Democratic Senate. Once he had that Senate, he'd get their way on a New York version of the DREAM Act, on marijuana decriminalization, and on public matching funds for state campaigns. It worked. Cuomo won the nomination with close to 60 percent of the vote. But that removed any threat that a Teachout and Wu ticket could spoil the Democrats. ""Boy, you want to see this club go nuts?"" says Dan Florentio, a retiree and regular at the Staten Island meeting. ""Mention Ralph Nader. If she ran and somehow cost Cuomo the election, she'd be the devil incarnate."" Since she's not running in the fall, since she's only now primarying Cuomo among Democrats, Teachout is instead copping a move from the Tea Party. Conservatives stayed inside the Republican Party to force it further right, and Teachout watched it with a combination of dread and jealousy. ""The tea parties represent a genuine, authentic civic anger,"" Teachout wrote in The Nation in 2009. ""I think the public anger is warranted. We are spending billions of dollars on bank bailouts that will not serve us. People are profoundly, and rightly, insecure about their jobs, where they live, their health care, and the economy. They are concerned, rightly, that the government's response seems to be driven by the financial industry. They are concerned, rightly, about the cost of the programs and the degree of deficit spending."" The left-wing Tea Party never happened. Occupy Wall Street happened, and Teachout spent time with New York activists, encouraging them to focus on ""Madison's idea of decentralized power."" The internal Democratic Party policing just never happened. Even in Chicago, where one possible progressive challenger to Mayor Rahm Emanuel led him by 22 points, the establishment scared her off with a tower of campaign money. Teachout will be outspent, too. Whoever was going to run against Cuomo was going to be outspent. In Staten Island, she ends her pitch with a real-life allegory about her family's Vermont farm, an idyllic place roamed by cows and chickens, and then, eventually, a bull. ""We weren't ready for the bull,"" says Teachout. She walks the crowd through the ensuing crisis, and how at age 8 she was dispatched to taunt the bull into running from a neighbor's property back into theirs. ""My job was to walk up to the bull, bother him a little bit, maybe tickle his nose, and then run as fast as I could."" Teachout pauses and grins wide. ""So now I'm running for governor of the state of New York."""	How Far Can Zephyr Teachout and Tim Wu Push New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo?	['Christie', 'Cuomo']	['gay']

While Congress continues to disappoint the unemployed and the undocumented, some prominent conservatives are helping to push bipartisan legislation to aid another marginalized constituency: criminals. Simply put, Republicans have helped make this the greatest Congress ever for pot smokers and thieves. Just last week, Sens. Rand Paul and Cory Booker unveiled the REDEEM Act, a bill that aims to help nonviolent offenders with measures that would restrict the use of solitary confinement for juveniles, grant certain drug offenders access to food stamps and welfare, and allow for the sealing of nonviolent criminal records. ""What I've found as I've been around Kentucky and met people is that I meet people who still have trouble getting a job because of their felony record sometimes,"" Paul said at a Politico event last Wednesday. ""And many of these are nonviolent felonies. And I think, really, you serve your time, you should get a second chance. And so to me it's a lot about trying to get people back into the society, back into employment."" Paul has been perhaps the most outspoken conservative in Congress to argue the need for criminal justice reform in recent months, but he's certainly not alone. Since the passage of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, a bill that reduced the infamous sentencing disparity between crack and powdered cocaine, a number of similarly focused, bipartisan bills have been put forward. Sen. Mike Lee has been working with Sen. Dick Durbin on a bill that will likely build upon the Justice Department's efforts to reduce mandatory minimums. In the spring, Sen. John Cornyn introduced a bill with Sen. Patrick Leahy aimed at bringing more oversight and accuracy into the use of forensics in criminal cases. Paul, who has worked with Leahy on another mandatory minimum bill and legislation to grant voting rights to nonviolent ex-cons, says that he's spoken with President Obama about combining REDEEM and some of the other bills into a major reform package. If that happens, it will be a significant policy accomplishment, as well as the culmination of a major policy reversal for leading conservatives who, almost simultaneously, have come to realize something liberals have long known: After decades of practice, we've gotten far too good at imprisoning people for minor offenses. Advancing that truth in conservative circles has been a project years in the making. For nearly a decade now, conservative activists and state policymakers have successfully pushed for corrective reform in the unlikeliest of places, including in a state famously at ease with putting criminals to death. In 2007, conservatives in the Texas legislature opted to close a major projected shortfall in prison space with probation reform and rehabilitation programs instead of with new prison beds and expensive corrections facilities. The results have been promising. ""Since then, Texas' incarceration rate has fallen nearly 20 percent, a decline attributed in large part to these programs,"" wrote Mother Jones' Shane Bauer earlier this year. ""Meanwhile, Texas' crime rate is at its lowest since 1968."" In 2010 the conservative group Right on Crime was formed to try to replicate Texas' success around the country. One of its leading advocates has been anti-tax advocate and liberal bogeyman Grover Norquist, who promoted the cause alongside Texas Gov. Rick Perry at the Conservative Political Action Conference in March. ""Republicans have tended to focus on those things that the government shouldn't be doing in the first place,"" he said. ""They also need to be--and are--spending more time now saying, 'OK, about those things that the government needs to do: Are we doing them as well as we should be?"" That state-level conversation has now moved to Congress, where forward-thinking Republicans are working to buck obstructionism and enact policies that could yield electoral dividends in the years ahead. Like immigration reform, justice reform can be seen, in part, as an effort at capturing a greater share of a crucial and largely Democratic voting bloc--black Americans, who are far more likely to be incarcerated. Unsurprisingly, justice reform was a cornerstone of Paul's speech at Howard University last year, an event that Norquist argues moved the needle on the issue for conservatives. Though Norquist is positive about the additional attention justice reform is now getting from conservatives at the national level, he holds reservations about federal inducements to state action of the kind proposed in the REDEEM Act. ""If this is dictated in Washington, then nobody at the state level has any buy-in and any interest in making it work,"" he contends. ""I think the way to do this is to find a handful of states and pass things there."" Conservative writer Ramesh Ponnuru, who has been at the center of endless discussion about the rise of reform conservatism, agrees that states should be given the freedom to rethink their corrections systems at their own pace, but he also thinks that national conservatives won't squander the chance to use the issue to improve perceptions of the Republican Party. ""I don't think it's any surprise that people want to soften their image as Republicans. And so this is one way of doing that,"" he said. ""And you're not going to be able to do that if you're a conservative lawmaker on Capitol Hill by saying, 'Well this might be a good idea, but I'm going to leave it to the states and otherwise keep my hands free of it.' "" In short, the looming central debate among Republicans on this issue will be about the role of the federal government in promoting justice reform rather than about whether justice reform should happen at all. Despite Rick Perry's best efforts to preserve it, ""tough on crime"" seems to be on its way out as a conservative mantra. ""Smart on crime"" is officially in."

The first was a case called Bush v. Gore. The second--less famous, but just as bitter--came two years later, in 2002, when I worked on a legal challenge to Florida's absurdly partisan redistricting plan, only to see our claims rejected by both the state and federal courts. So last week's court ruling overturning gerrymandered congressional districts in Florida gave me a serious case of deja vu for several reasons. First, its author was Leon County Circuit Court Judge Terry Lewis--a major figure in the post-2000 Florida election litigation miasma, who ultimately wound up overseeing the statewide hand recount of ballots that the U.S. Supreme Court halted in its infamous 5-4 order. Second, the ruling represented a long overdue vindication of our 2002 claim that the Florida Legislature had abused its power in entrenching its control over the state through redistricting. While much of the coverage of Lewis' opinion has focused on the Florida legislative ""chicanery"" that it laid bare, a more substantial question is this: Why did this case strike down a hyper-partisan districting plan, when virtually every other such court challenge, in virtually every other state, has failed over the past three decades? How was the widespread bastardization that allows ""representatives to pick their voters, instead of voters picking their representatives"" finally checked by a court decision? The key, as Lewis' opinion makes clear, was the 2010 addition to the Florida Constitution known as the ""Fair District"" amendments.

Democratic Reps. Luis Gutierrez, Beto O'Rourke, and Henry Cuellar said so over the past week. Democratic political celebrity Wendy Davis, who is running to be governor of Texas, said so, too. Washington Post Editorial Page Editor Fred Hiatt includes the blunder in his list of sins that calls for a reshuffling of the top staffers in his administration. President Obama is already criticized for being too slow to act, aloof, and out of sync with the public. He inhabits a political office, but sniffs at the theatrical requirements required. ""This isn't theater,"" he said. ""This is a problem. I'm not interested in photo ops, I'm interested in solving a problem."" This episode seems like just another confirming piece of data in a long-term trend. But that's not right. President Obama will happily engage in a photo op. Here he is at the Key Bridge. Here he sends an unsubtle message to the Russians from a meeting with the Polish president. Here he shoots pool. Yum, barbecue! Tuesday he sat in a simulator car. He pushes his staff to seek out photo ops across the country and he's asked his Cabinet to travel this summer to engage in their own. The issue is not his unwillingness to engage in this particular form of presidential art. He's making a choice: when a photo-op isn't to his advantage, he elevates avoiding it to a high-minded ideal. The problem for the president, like all presidents, is that he thinks he has a say in the argument over whether a photo op is meaningful or not. He doesn't. Part of the fix he's in is of his own making. The blunt formula that equates presidential authority with a presidential visit to the scene of a crisis is one that he exploits when it suits him. So in this case, when the president makes the sensible case that his authority should be deployed to other facets of the problem than the border itself, it's no surprise people don't listen. The bully pulpit is undergoing a radical transformation. Technological changes have made it harder for a president to capture the public conversation. The high level of partisanship--in politics and the media--means that even if a presidential message does get through, it'll have a pretty thick coating of spin and counterspin before people have a chance to swallow it. President Obama understands this much, and he has tried to refashion the lines of communication. That's what the president's visits to The View and late-night TV shows are about. That's why the Baltimore Ravens were enlisted to help sell health care reform. In this world, a picture of the president has enormous power. It can be tweeted and Instagrammed to send a message better than any speech he might deliver. As a second-term president, Obama is more reliant on the photo op than ever because it's harder for him to get noticed and covered. So the president traveled to Denver last week to meet with people who had written him letters, to send the message that he is focused on the middle class. It was a purely symbolic gesture, an act of total and complete theater. So no wonder people hear there is a crisis at the border and want to see him there. He's conditioned them to think that when something is serious, he pays it a visit. If you release pictures of the president in the Situation Room showing he's on the case in one instance (when maybe you're trying to milk the drama of the moment), then people are going to expect a Situation Room photograph from the night of the Benghazi attack or from the first night of unrest in Ukraine. A president can't suddenly get virginal about the theatricality of photo ops when it doesn't suit him. It rightfully makes us suspicious of him when he does. But does it make any policy sense to go to the border? There can be good policy reasons for a showy presidential visit. It quickens action. No one leans on his shovel when the president calls. Also, it can send a message of fellow-feeling to those who are suffering, as it did with all of the post-hurricane visits President George W. Bush made, and with the one he didn't make immediately after Katrina. There's also a case that a president learns something from an emergency visit, but it's not a strong case. A president must be able to act without seeing something firsthand, particularly when moving a president outside of the White House compound is such a production. It's a crucial job skill, so it's silly to think he's not acting if he's working from home. Perhaps a visit to the home countries these children are leaving would have been interesting. It seems to have been effective for a Republican congressional delegation that just returned from there. But none of the lawmakers who have visited the border has returned with any potent revelations. They have mostly used the trip as a stage to assert their pre-existing views. Sen. Obama was certainly familiar with this stunt. He did it with a visit to Iraq during his first presidential campaign. It's an effective communications tool, but it's not an information-gathering tool. In this case, President Obama probably wants to avoid the type of feel-good message that photo ops are intended to convey. Indeed, that kind of message would likely backfire. ""You have the president surrounded by little 7-year-olds, and it's an emotional picture,"" says Diana Negroponte, a public policy scholar and Latin America expert at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. ""It says to Mama and Papa, 'We have this wonderful president. He will take care of them.' "" Instead, says Negroponte, the president should be sending the opposite message to the parents in their home country: The children will return. If that ultimately is the message the president does send by approving a faster deportation process, it's easier for him to do so if he hasn't had to look these young people in the eye in a big public photo op. A veteran Democratic strategist explains that looking hard-hearted in that way has a clear political downside: It will upset a part of the president's base and damage the Democratic Party's advantage over Republicans on the question of which party is more empathetic toward Latinos in an election year when the deck is already stacked against the party. A visit to the border also has other political downsides White House aides were considering when they decided not to send Obama there last week when he was in Texas. It risks validating the separate Republican argument about the primacy of border security that has been a part of the larger immigration debate. The White House and Democrats argue that this current crisis is not a result of a porous border, but other factors, including violence in the countries these children are fleeing. The fastest plausible way to send a message back to these home countries, say members of both parties, is if buses start returning with migrants who have not been allowed into the United States. That will happen faster if Congress amends the 2008 law that treats children from Central America differently than migrants from Mexico. Republican Sen. John Cornyn and Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas have introduced legislation shortening the length of detention hearings. It would send immigration judges to border cities with the hopes of quickening the process for determining whether minors had a legal claim to stay in the United States. Presidential visits are effective when they quicken action, but they also raise the expectation of action. A presidential visit to the border with no quick fix to announce runs the risk of increasing the impression the president is helpless in a crisis. If action from Congress, whether in the Cornyn-Cuellar legislation or of some other shape, is needed, then a more effective presidential photo op than a visit to the border would be a visit to Congress. Another alternative photo op would be a picture of the president on the phone with the president of Mexico. ""The president needs to call the Mexican president and say, 'Neighbor, we need your help,' "" says Negroponte. "" 'The passage of this many children needs your help to stop it.' "" Negroponte argues that the crisis--which includes the deaths of children who did not make it to the border--could not be happening without the complicity of Mexican authorities. President Obama has suggested that he might have preferred a photo op of a White House signing ceremony for comprehensive immigration reform, which Republicans in the House have refused to address. Perhaps, but that's too cute. The president knows that comprehensive immigration reform is not going to be born out of this crisis in time to address the crisis. If anything, Republicans who have been counseling a go-slow approach now have more momentum. The surge of cases at the border helps them make the case that well-intentioned laws have unintended consequences. The president is trying to deflect the political damage of the current crisis back on Republicans by reminding voters of their weakness. If he's going to play that game, then Republicans might as well play the photo-op game."	Obama Conditioned Us to Expect Photo Ops. He Can't Change Our Expectations When It Suits Him.

23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/07/chicago_july_4_shooting_spree_the_police_department_undercounts_murder_and.html	"Over the Fourth of July holiday weekend in Chicago, 82 people were shot in an 84-hour window, according to the Chicago Tribune. Fourteen were dead by Monday morning, including two boys, aged 14 and 16, who were killed by police in separate incidents when they allegedly refused to drop their guns. Things were so chaotic Sunday night that officers responding to the spasm of violence reportedly kept interrupting one another on their radios to report still newer bursts of gunfire. The string of shootings garnered national media attention and prompted Mayor Rahm Emanuel to plead with residents on Monday to put down their guns. ""Wherever you are, wherever you live, the gun violence that was part of this weekend is totally unacceptable,"" Emanuel told a gathering of concerned citizens on the city's South Side, where many of the shootings took place. The outbreak of violence stood in stark contrast to the message coming from Chicago City Hall in April, when Emanuel and his police superintendent, Garry McCarthy, trumpeted police statistics that showed the city had seen its lowest number of murders for the first three months of a year in more than a half-century. That announcement followed January's much-hyped news that 2013's homicide total was 415--still a lot of people killed, but 88 fewer than the previous year and the lowest total since 1965. Emanuel, up for re-election early next year, has highlighted the city's progress in curbing violence in what was the nation's murder capital in 2012. How do we reconcile these two seemingly contradictory narratives? On the one hand, the stats suggest that violent crime is falling in Chicago; on the other, the Windy City remains riddled by gang-related violence. The Fourth's bloody toll wasn't even unusual. Just last year, more than 70 people were shot, 13 of whom were killed, during the same four-day stretch. Things were slightly better in 2012, with at least 8 people killed. All told, if you tally the homicides in Chicago over the Thursday-to-Sunday window closest to July 4, this year's long weekend was the eighth since 2002 to see double-digit murders, according to the city's own statistics. The sad reality is that by the time July 4, 2015, rolls around, we will have largely forgotten this past weekend's violence. We've already done so for last year's Independence Day. The fact that this past holiday weekend was only marginally worse than last year's was a detail largely missing from much of the coverage this week. Even the Tribune, which provided by far the most detailed coverage of the shootings in real time, failed to mention the comparison in its online report on Monday and made only a passing, vague reference to it in its otherwise-comprehensive front-page follow-up the next day. Likewise, few reports bothered to mention a similar string of shootings less than three months ago that left 9 dead and 36 others injured over Easter weekend. The media might have a short memory when it comes to Chicago violence, but the city's Police Department appears to go to great lengths to willfully forget. Chicago magazine published a two-part investigation this year that detailed how the department appeared to be using pretty much every trick in the CompStat book to artificially deflate the city's homicide and violent crime numbers. The reporters, David Bernstein and Noah Isackson, were able to identify 10 people ""who were beaten, burned, suffocated, or shot to death in 2013 and whose cases were reclassified as death investigations, downgraded to more minor crimes, or even closed as noncriminal incidents--all for illogical or, at best, unclear reasons."" Given more time and better access, the article implies, the two reporters could have found plenty more examples of what would be considered murders by everyone but the police. The magazine's investigation likewise documented that the police used similar tricks to depress the city's larger violent crime rate. McCarthy has brushed off those allegations as ""absolute nonsense,"" but Chicago magazine isn't alone in making them. A recent audit from the city's inspector general that focused on assault-related incidents found that police were counting crimes with multiple victims as a single offense, an accounting trick that led to an underreporting of victims by 24 percent in the sample studied. That means a shooting that left a half-dozen people injured--as several did this past weekend--might register in the police books as a single shooting incident. Put another way, recent history suggests that there's a realistic chance that by this time next year, the dead and injured from this past July Fourth won't be fully counted in Chicago's official crime statistics. Even if a portion of the recent drop in crime numbers is due to a statistical sleight of hand, most observers agree that violent crime is indeed falling in Chicago, as it is in most major cities. But the overall numbers obscure the fact that Chicago is a city of neighborhoods, and much of the violence has been sequestered in poor, predominantly black areas of the city where gang violence goes largely unnoticed unless it comes in bunches, as it did this past weekend. After crunching the homicide numbers for 2000 through 2010, Yale University sociologist Andrew Papachristos found that the murder rate was about 3.1 per 100,000 residents living in the Northwest side's Jefferson Park. Less than 10 miles away in West Garfield Park, the rate was more than 20 times that, a staggering 64 per 100,000, or roughly in line with the casualty rate for civilians in Iraq at the height of the last war. When people describe parts of Chicago as urban war zones, it is not hyperbole. Seven aldermen on the City Council have called for an investigation into how the Police Department keeps its books, and an ACLU lawsuit against the city on behalf of a West Side community group claiming that the city doesn't deploy police equitably across neighborhoods continues to wind its way through court. Meanwhile, the violence continues. On Tuesday, the day after Emanuel spoke on the South Side, two more people died from gunshot wounds suffered over the weekend, and at least 11 more people were shot, including a 23-year-old riding his bike and a 17-year-old boy who was walking through a park with a group of friends. The teen was set to start college orientation on Thursday. Both died at the respective scenes."	Chicago's Bloody July Fourth Weekend: Who Is Counting the Dead?	['McCarthy']	['guns']
24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/07/congress_and_border_control_immigrant_kids_can_t_spur_politicians_to_action.html	"Do you remember the angle on immigration reform everyone used to agree on? Easy: It was ""the children."" Until the middle of June, the least controversial legalization proposal (not quite a bill) in Congress was citizenship for children brought illegally to the United States by their parents. Even some Republicans who'd opposed the Dream Act, which would have enabled this, had ""evolved"" with the years. ""It is time to provide an opportunity for legal residence and citizenship for those who were brought to this country as children and who know no other home,"" said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""Put yourself in their shoes,"" said President Obama in 2012. ""They are Americans in their hearts, in their minds, in every single way but one: on paper."" The president said that when announcing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which only lifted the threat of deportation for people under 31 and residing in the United States since before 2007. This proved to be fantastic politics, bolstering his re-election--which inspired a panic among ""reform conservatives,"" which is one reason that the Senate passed the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act last year. Think of the children! We can't deport the children! Perhaps this wasn't the right way to think of the problem. Cantor lost his primary, thanks in part to his immigration waffling. It was around that time--perfect news-cycle synchronicity--that the surge of illegal child immigration across the Mexican border was elevated from local news story to national crisis. It's estimated that 57,000 unaccompanied children have crossed the border since October. These days they're not eliciting much sympathy at all. Protesters are blocking buses full of kids leaving detention centers from entering a border station. Reformers and restrictionists have retreated into their silos. The pundit class has found a silo of its own, weather-beaten but sturdy, where it can ask the key question: Is this Obama's Katrina? Some say yes; others disagree. You'd hardly notice that Congress is sitting on an immigration bill that would have funded a ""border surge,"" doubling the size of the border fence from 350 to 700 miles and more than doubling the presence of border agents--18,500 to 38,500. That's not saying the bill would have prevented this crisis, which has a lot to do with a (previously) uncontroversial 2008 law that offered humanitarian protections to young border-crossers from Central America. That was a for-the-children measure, too, aimed at sex traffickers and slavers, and there's no appetite for it anymore. No, the argument restrictionists are making, with confidence, is that Obama's loose touch sparked the crisis. It's a ""crisis of his own making,"" according to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, because the president had been ""promising amnesty"" and ignoring the border. ""We either have an incredibly inept administration,"" said Texas Gov. Rick Perry this week, ""or they're in on this somehow or another."" The theory is that the administration is not above stoking a crisis and that it's actually played games like this before, as when it allowed loose guns to be ""walked"" into Mexico for the eventual purpose of scaring Americans into backing gun control. (This was and is the National Rifle Association's theory.) And the theorizing has been pretty one-sided; Republican reformers say that the eruption of a border crisis makes a liar out of the Obama Department of Homeland Security. ""It hurts,"" said Sen. John McCain to reporters on Tuesday, ""because we have not taken the measures necessary to have a secure border--although the issue here is not a secure border. The children are just showing up. We need more National Guard or whatever it is. We need a change in policy. The message has to go: 'If you cross the border illegally, you will be returned immediately.' "" McCain was reacting to the administration's announcement that it would seek $3.7 billion in emergency funds to beef up border security and speed up deportations. (As long as we're talking Katrina, that crisis led to a $51.8 billion recovery bill.) On the Hill, this was greeted with a synchronized shrug. ""People don't believe that the laws are being enforced,"" explained Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, one of the authors of the Senate's 2013 reform bill. ""They never believed it beforehand. They have good reason not to believe it now."" The way Rubio talked to reporters, you could be forgiven for thinking that ""comprehensive reform,"" the great hope of 2013, was alive. ""I think that the only way you're ever going to get the votes in Washington to move forward on immigration is through a three-step process,"" starting with enforcement, said Rubio.  Did that mean passing the supplemental $3.7 billion? Not as it stood: ""Let's not just throw money at it. Let's put in place the sorts of technological things and increased manpower similar to the bill we passed in the Senate."" Did this mean Rubio's immigration bill? No, it could mean a smaller bill, dealing with security and nothing else. ""If they pass it out of the House,"" said Rubio, ""I think we can potentially pass it out of the Senate, unless the Democrats decide to object to it, because it doesn't have legalization and all the other things associated with it."" In a small way, the overwhelming Capitol Hill cynicism about how to respond to the border crisis is healthy. Panicking after a crisis and passing whatever's on the shelf gave us the Patriot Act. Panicking about sex trafficking--why, that's part of what caused this crisis in the first place. It's just striking that the story of children fleeing horror, and getting stuck on the wrong side of the border, has hardened the positions every member of Congress had before the crisis. Every member of Congress, but not everyone in politics. This week, on his radio show/Web TV network, Glenn Beck announced plans to bring trailers full of water, teddy bears, and soccer balls to the border. ""I've never taken a position more deadly to my career than this,"" he said. ""Anyone, left or right, seeking political gain at the expense of these desperate, vulnerable, poor, and suffering people are reprehensible."" But it was the left that truly worried Beck. He needed to act, he said, because the border crisis could turn into a battle. He'd opposed Cliven Bundy's standoff when it threatened to become a casus belli for a crackdown, for Obama's ""fundamental transformation"" of America.

This year, I'm planning to get matching bald eagle tattoos on my biceps. But for me, at least, Independence Day is also an opportunity for reflection on who we are as a nation and where we're headed. I'll admit that I'm worried. Earlier this week, Belgium eliminated the United States from the World Cup. But consider that there is a decent chance that Belgium might not exist by the time the next World Cup rolls around, because of the bitter divide between its Flemish speakers and its French speakers. I say this with a heavy heart. Yes, Belgium. Congratulations on scoring your goals. Now enjoy the dustbin of history as your nation is torn apart by deep-seated ethnopolitical resentment. Meanwhile, the United States, a sprawling and spectacularly diverse continental republic with a heavily armed and famously irascible population more than 28 times that of Belgium, will almost certainly be around come 2018, at which point we will easily trounce the soccer teams of Flanders, Wallonia, and the Grand Duchy of Brussels, or whatever random assortment of states emerges from Belgium's wreckage. But Belgium-bashing aside, we Americans should not rest on our laurels. America is big, awesome, and beautiful. We're also divided in ways we can't afford to ignore. This is not to say that the union is tottering on the brink of collapse. There are many good reasons as to why the United States has stayed intact for so long. We had the bloody Civil War some years ago, and the idea of secession has long been discredited as a result. Recent years have seen a number of peaceful secessions, such as the ""velvet divorce"" between the Czech Republic and Slovakia. It is far from obvious that the United States would be willing to use its military might to coerce Hawaii or Alaska from leaving the union if, for whatever reason, their electorates were determined to do so. So I doubt that it is the threat of chaos and violence alone that keeps us together. Unlike Belgium, the United States does not have linguistic divisions that map relatively neatly onto geographical divisions, which helps dampen secessionist sentiment. Yet there is no question that the differences in the cultural sensibilities of, say, the Deep South and the Pacific Northwest are far greater than the differences between Ontario and America's neighboring Great Lakes states. A few wild-eyed dreamers have thus wondered if we've necessarily divvied up North America in the right way, from environmentalists dreaming of an ""Ecotopia"" west of the Cascade Mountains to white nationalists looking to build an Aryan ethnostate in northern Idaho and Montana. George Kennan, the renowned foreign policy thinker and all-purpose crank, fantasized late in life about a fragmentation of the United States not unlike that which befell the Soviet Union. Could America break apart along religious lines, with devout Christians going one way and the rest of us going another? Think of the old ""Jesusland"" meme--the map of a North America divided between ""Jesusland,"" the states that backed George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential election, and ""the United States of Canada,"" consisting of the states that backed John Kerry and Canada that delighted liberals enraged by Bush's re-election. At least some devout religious believers fear that as the ranks of the religiously unaffiliated grow, and as secular Americans insist on imposing their values on others, the faithful might face persecution. In 2000, Father John McCloskey, a conservative Catholic with a polarizing reputation, penned a controversial fictional take on how America might break apart. In it, a new religiously infused country, the Regional States of North America, secedes from the United States in the wake of a ""short and relatively bloodless conflict"" with their secularist oppressors. Fortunately, good sense usually prevails. Way back in March of 2012, Vice President Joe Biden, he of the loose lips, told an audience at Iowa State University that the Obama administration had ""screwed up"" the first version of its contraception mandate by failing to provide some accommodation for religious nonprofits that wanted no part of it. Yet the president did eventually accommodate religious nonprofits. And though the White House didn't want to extend this accommodation to companies like Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court intervened to suggest, gently, that if the accommodation worked for religious nonprofits--that is, if the goals of the contraception mandate could still be achieved without forcing these organizations to do something they'd prefer not to do--it could work for closely held private companies. Rough-and-ready compromises like this one are why McCloskey's nightmare vision will never come close to coming to pass. But there are other threats to American national unity looming on the horizon. My admittedly unscientific sense is that we are living through a period in which Americans' sense of solidarity or group cohesiveness is declining. Liberals tend to see this decline in solidarity as a symptom of income and wealth inequality. Conservatives blame it on a rising emphasis on ethnic identity over national identity, or the turn to moral relativism. I see it as a product of the economic and social isolation of huge chunks of our population. One challenge is a thoughtless immigration policy, which makes it hard for immigrants currently living and working in the United States to find a foothold in American life. When we debate immigration policy, we tend to focus on the economic impact of future immigration on native-born workers. What we forget is that 13 percent of the people living in the United States were born abroad, and immigrants make up 16.3 percent of the U.S. workforce. These immigrants are already a part of our society, and their interests should count for something. While some of these immigrants are the kind of high-fliers who found Silicon Valley startups and hedge funds, far more of them are people with modest skills who are struggling to find their footing in a changing economy. Poverty among naturalized immigrants--that is, those who have become U.S. citizens--is lower than poverty among native-born Americans. Poverty among unauthorized immigrants, however, is extremely, heartbreakingly high, both because it is hard to make a living when you're living in the shadows, but also because unauthorized immigrants tend to have the lowest skill levels. If we grant legal status to unauthorized immigrants, and if we accept that we have a responsibility to protect the interests of the immigrants who currently live and work in the United States, the last thing we should do is increase future immigration, which will intensify labor market competition for these workers. Moreover, it will tend to delay the assimilation process, as immigrants will be less likely to settle in integrated neighborhoods and form bonds with Americans from backgrounds different from their own. Then there is the intense concentration of poverty, the issue that keeps me up at night. While 14.9 percent of the U.S. population was below the poverty line in 2010, a quarter of all poor Americans lived in neighborhoods with poverty rates above 20 percent. These ""poverty areas"" are, as a general rule, disconnected from employment opportunities and high-quality educational options, and their inhabitants suffer from disproportionately high rates of violent crime and incarceration. The result is that the legitimacy of American institutions--the criminal justice system in particular, but other institutions as well--is on shaky ground in these parts of the country, as they seem to be rigged against those who live in them. There is no danger that America's poor neighborhoods will secede from the United States. The real problem is that the rest of us have, in a cultural and spiritual sense, seceded from these neighborhoods. So as we celebrate the United States, let's remember the forgotten corners of this country, where the promise of American life has yet to be fulfilled."

Just four weeks earlier, Senate candidate Chris McDaniel had campaigned at this branch of the proudly Christian chicken-sandwich chain, promising ""shock waves through this country"" if conservatives helped him win. McDaniel had forced a runoff--shock waves rumbled as promised--but in Round Two, incumbent Sen. Thad Cochran beat him. The ""establishment"" succeeded in besting the Tea Party with crossover votes from Democrats. Sowell, a pastor and businessman who'd campaigned for McDaniel, was leading the first Tea Party meeting since that crushing loss. Typically, 20 or so activists showed up. Thirty showed up on Monday. ""They were fired up,"" Sowell recalled. ""It's not just that we lost. It's how we lost. Outside of anything being illegal, it was just the fact that Chris got the most Republican votes, and the fact [the Cochran campaign] made Chris' supporters appear to be racists. I hope, and a lot of people hope, there are legal challenges."" Legal challenges. Outside of Mississippi and outside of the conservative media, the election's on the books already. The consultants who bailed out Cochran, led by Mississippi native and Romney 2008 and 2012 veteran Stu Stevens, have taken victory laps and explained how a GOP candidate appealed to black Democrats. ""Should it come as any shock,"" asked Stevens, rhetorically, ""that on the 50th anniversary of Freedom Summer, African-Americans also wanted to participate in the electoral process?"" Speaking at the Aspen Ideas Festival, about as far from a Tea Party meeting as the Voyager 2 probe, Hillary Clinton praised the ""major historical importance"" of Cochran's  win. But to McDaniel and the Tea Party, it feels like a historic fraud. The law was clear, and anyone who voted in the state's Democratic primary broke it if they voted in the Republican runoff. The McDaniel team prepared for this; they warned about this. Since the election, volunteers have been showing up at polling sites to comb through voter rolls and prove that enough voters crossed over to invalidate the win, and Facebooking what they find. They're optimistic, and Team McDaniel is cheering them on. On June 26, the conservative blogger Jim Hoft reported that McDaniel was targeting 10 counties where Democratic votes might have flipped the outcome. Black conservative Kim Wade had photographed just one page of a poll book in which, he claimed, three people had pulled a Democratic ballot on June 3 and a Republican ballot on June 24. The Mississippi Tea Party told reporters that it had found ""nearly 800"" votes cast this way, in a heavily black county where the Cochran vote had surged from 10,928 to 17,949. The next day, McDaniel's campaign made a fundraising pitch. ""On June 3rd we won the popular vote,"" wrote McDaniel in an email to supporters. ""On June 24th we won the Republican primary election. As you might have heard, we're not quite done. We are in the process of trying to ensure a fair and accurate election took place on Tuesday."" Any interested supporters were told to email a special account at the  Tyner Law Firm in Jackson; after that, the ""campaign will plug you in and arm you with the tools you need to be successful."" What tools? The law firm isn't saying, but some conservatives are trying to make a challenge inevitable. ""Only a fool would dispute that McDaniel is the clear choice of Republicans in [Mississippi],"" Tea Party Patriots President Jenny Beth Martin told Breitbart's Matt Boyle. ""He is, by all rights, the Republican nominee, regardless of what state law states."" This was a slight departure from the standard Tea Party Patriots pitch of ""reaching out to Democrats and independents."" But the sentiment was real. In the runup to the primary, an overzealous McDaniel supporter named Clayton Kelly was arrested on suspicion of photographing Cochran's bedridden wife. Three other activists, including Tea Party leader Mark Mayfield, were arrested in short succession. Mayfield was found dead on Friday, the victim of an apparent suicide. On July 1, Grant Sowell and other leaders attended Mayfield's funeral. These aren't people inclined to back down from a legal challenge. They are inclined to believe the worst about Cochran's campaign. Charles C. Johnson, a freelance journalist with a record that includes some duds and more scoops, has taken a leading role in the fight back. It was Johnson, on Election Day, who recorded a robocall asking black voters to oppose the ""Tea Party"" candidate and tweeted a photo of what appeared to be a flier about how ""the Tea Party intends to prevent blacks from voting."" This accusation has been on McDaniel supporters' minds--this attack on them as hooded ghosts from the Jim Crow era--as they have been looking through the poll books. While Cochran supporters watch in disbelief, Johnson's reporting is bringing more conservatives into the legal fight. On June 30, Johnson posted an audio interview with the Rev. Stevie Fielder, who claimed that a Cochran staffer had paid him to bribe black voters with envelopes containing $15. The story came with photos of Fielder holding up what appeared to be email exchanges with a staffer; it also came with the disclosure that Fielder had been paid to talk. Cochran's campaign denied everything and explained that Johnson--who was unreliable, and a blogger, by the way--got it wrong. ""We hire a lot of people, black, white, young, old, to help with get out the vote efforts,"" spokesman Jordan Russell told the Jackson Clarion-Ledger. ""Whether you're a high school kid in Northeast Jackson or a retired nurse in Greenwood, if you're out working doors for us, you get paid in cash, in an envelope."" But that answer came hours after the Fielder tape had burned up social media. By the time Russell responded, FreedomWorks--which had made no previous moves to support the legal challenge--issued a statement calling for prosecutors to get involved. ""This is a federal crime and requires swift action by the Department of Justice and the FBI,"" said the group's national political director, Russ Walker. ""The faith the American people have in the electoral process is critical to the success of our representative democracy. These are serious allegations that, if true, undermine the integrity of our electoral process."" Meanwhile, the McDaniel campaign was claiming 1,500 sketchy votes in Hinds County--almost double what the Tea Party had claimed. ""We don't have to prove that we have 7,000 [invalid] votes,"" spokesman Neil Fritsch told Fox News. ""All there needs to be is enough doubt about the election, and we're confident about that."" There's no Plan C. There's no recent precedent for a challenge like this. For the moment, there are just the poll books, and the rumors, and the trading of insults. ""People [are] saying, 'I hate that I voted for Thad,' "" said Grant Sowell. ""The Tea Parties in Mississippi are growing like never before. I've had people apologizing to people for not being more involved. They feel like what's going on is not just unethical but ungodly."""

28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/07/liberals_support_hillary_clinton_african_american_voters_will_give_her_the.html	"Somehow, six years after a divisive, bitter primary against a liberal challenger, Hillary Clinton has become the darling of the Democratic left. To liberal Democrats, she's more ""tough,"" ""honest,"" and exciting than any other figure in the party. As Noam Scheiber writes in an excellent feature on Clinton and the left for the New Republic, ""it's a striking turnaround for a candidate who, when her opponent famously proclaimed her 'likeable enough' in 2008, discovered that less than half her party agreed."" For Scheiber--who pegs the change to partisan solidarity--liberal support is key to Clinton's presidential ambitions, if she runs. Without dissatisfied liberals to fuel an anti-Clinton insurgency, he argues, the former secretary of state has an easy path to the nomination, even with her liabilities on income inequality and her close relationship to Wall Street and other titans of the 1 percent. ""What's so unusual about Clinton's standing is that, unlike 2008, it's almost certain to hold up even against a perfectly positioned challenger--say, Elizabeth Warren, the most beloved economic populist in the country,"" writes Scheiber. At the risk of nitpicking, I think it's wrong to call Warren ""perfectly positioned."" Not because she isn't talented and popular, but because liberals--or at least, self-identified liberals--aren't enough to win a Democratic primary. Key to Scheiber's case is the idea that liberals killed the Clinton candidacy of 2008 and could do the same in 2016 if they backed Warren or another credible challenger. But while liberals were a necessary part of the Obama insurgency, they weren't sufficient to stop the Clinton machine. To wit, self-identified liberals were just 39 percent of all Democrats in 2008, followed by moderates (38 percent) and conservatives (21 percent). Or you could just look at Clinton's record in the primary, where liberal opposition couldn't block her victories in New Hampshire, California, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Massachusetts, and Arizona. Clinton's problem had less to do with liberals and more with blacks, who formed a critical share of the Democratic primary electorate. Scheiber points to this in a footnote, but it's worth a full take. Put simply, a Democratic presidential candidate can't win the primary without substantial support from black voters, who tend to vote for the establishment choice. Accordingly, it's when black Americans back a challenger that the establishment candidate falters, which is to say that if Hillary Clinton had kept a decent share of the black vote, she would have become the Democratic nominee, regardless of liberal disdain for her candidacy. To see this, you just have to look at the numbers. As the year wore on, Barack Obama was winning black electorates by huge margins of 8- or 9-to-1 in delegate-rich states like Virginia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio, and Georgia. In states where Clinton was weak, like Illinois, this gave Obama a huge victory outright, with an abundance of votes and delegates heading to the convention. And in states where she was strong, like Pennsylvania, this allowed Obama to play a close game and win a respectable number of votes. As political scientist Tom Schaller noted toward the end of the primary season, ""Clinton squeezed out the same number of net delegates from her 17-point win in New York and 9-point win in Pennsylvania as Obama did in his 31-point win in Illinois--even though New York and Pennsylvania combined ... awarded nearly two and half times the delegates that Illinois did."" And while a modest increase in Clinton's black support--from 10 or 15 percent to 20 or 25 percent--may not have been sufficient to win her a delegate lead, as Schaller later points out, it could have swung the popular vote in her favor. I can imagine the objection. Obama was viable and black. Clinton didn't stand a chance with blacks. But that's a bit of revisionist history. Remember, for all of 2007, Clinton held the lead with black voters. In one August poll by the Pew Research Center, 94 percent of black Democrats held a favorable view of Clinton, compared with 88 percent for Obama. In the same poll, 47 percent supported her candidacy, compared with 34 percent for Obama. Likewise, an October CNN poll found that Clinton was supported by 57 percent of black Democrats, versus 33 percent for Obama. And toward the end of the year, Clinton continued to hold a favorability advantage, with favorable ratings from 83 percent of blacks, versus 74 percent for Obama. Obama's huge black support only came after his first-place finish in the Iowa caucuses in January 2008, where he proved himself a strong candidate with broad appeal. And once it did, he quickly became a credible candidate in a way that escaped similar liberal challengers, like Howard Dean in 2004 or Bill Bradley in 2000, who couldn't build the same foothold. What's more, he was helped along by the Clinton campaign's missteps with black voters--from Bill's ""fairy tale"" description of Obama's chances to her argument that she was a better candidate to win ""hard-working Americans, white Americans."" Absent Clinton's tactical and rhetorical mistakes, she could have held on to a substantial chunk of the black vote, denying Obama the lopsided margins he needed to win--even if he held the majority of liberal support. Which brings us back to the present. Yes, Hillary Clinton benefits from her new popularity with liberals, but her strength comes from her position with black voters, who seem committed to a Clinton candidacy. And as long as that's true, Hillary Clinton can't lose the 2016 Democratic primary, period. So, if you're among the people pushing Elizabeth Warren to run for the nomination, here's a suggestion to pass along. If Sen. Warren is interested and wants a chance to win, she should spend a bit less time in Oregon and West Virginia, and a lot more in South Carolina."	Clinton Doesn't Need Liberals. She Needs Black Voters.

29	29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/06/ex_im_bank_and_koch_brothers_the_libertarian_campaign_to_kill_the_export.html	"It was Sept. 22, 2008, at the dizzying height of the financial crisis and the moment when Barack Obama took a commanding lead in the presidential race. He was campaigning in Wisconsin, a state he'd win easily. He softened a speech about Wall Street greed with some examples of government at its worst. ""There are some [programs] that have been duplicated by other programs that we just need to cut back,"" said candidate Obama, ""like waste at the Economic Development Agency [sic] and the Export-Import Bank that's become little more than a fund for corporate welfare."" The line landed with a quiet thud. None of the media on the scene bothered to print Obama's quote about a New Deal-era agency that guarantees loans for companies selling overseas. The AP led with Obama's promise to ""slash federal spending on contractors by 10 percent,"" the Green Bay Press Gazette with Obama accusing John McCain of ""flip-flopping,"" and the Chicago Sun-Times with a note about the ""uncharacteristic number of empty seats"" in the arena. (Someone named Sarah Palin had been a bigger draw.) But people aren't ignoring Ex-Im (as it's universally abbreviated) anymore. A government agency that was too dull to write about is suddenly the perfect libertarian target. It took years of messaging, much of it by groups funded by the omnipresent Koch network, but Ex-Im has emerged as a test for whether ""libertarian populism"" can win a vote in Congress. Obama's own Ex-Im quote stayed rather obscure until March 2012. That was when the Club for Growth, which predates the growth of the Koch network but has benefited from it, began attacking the bank's May 2012 reauthorization vote. The bank periodically needs to be reauthorized by Congress, a process that has happened more or less routinely every few years since the 1940s. It needs to be reauthorized by Sept. 30, 2014, or it will shut down. But the Club was not ideally positioned to lead this charge against Ex-Im, because the Club's own president, former Indiana Rep. Chris Chocola, had a family business, CTB, that had benefited from Ex-Im assistance. When Chocola denounced the bank's ""corporate welfare,"" its defenders had an exploding cigar with his name on it. ""I never heard the words 'Ex-Im Bank' once when I was CEO,"" Chocola says today. ""Apparently someone had, because apparently we did use some of their financing in our sales. But we never once, in our sales and budgetary planning, ever talked about Ex-Im Bank and said it was critical to our success. It made no difference to us. It didn't save one job. It didn't create any opportunities that didn't exist before."" The Club targeted Ex-Im despite the Chocola embarrassment, using the Obama sound bite to make its case. American Commitment, a new group launched by Phil Kerpen, formerly of the Koch-funded Americans for Prosperity, joined the charge against Ex-Im in 2012 too. The initial 2012 attack failed: John Boehner's House of Representatives extended the Ex-Im charter in an easy, 330-93 vote. Republican Rep. Gary Miller had sponsored the reauthorization, and every Democrat who hadn't abstained had voted for it. The extension squeezed in a few reforms, requiring quarterly reports from the bank. Rebellion crushed, story over, victory party over at the Chamber of Commerce, open bar. But the libertarians never gave up. After the 2012 elections, which plenty of conservatives blamed on Mitt Romney's cufflinked public image, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, an Ex-Im critic, took over the House Financial Services Committee. Throughout 2013, into 2014, Heritage Action and David Koch's Americans for Prosperity worked with the libertarians who'd always hated Ex-Im. AFP went for the giving-money-to-foreigners angle. ""Washington politicians have sent billions to countries like China, Russia, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia,"" tsk-tsked a narrator in a recent video, ""through the taxpayer-backed Export-Import Bank."" In 2013 a polling group called Public Notice created a virality-destined parody of 1980s action figures--the Kronies--who personified all the ways that rent-seeking ripped Americans off. Captain Corn represented mandates for ethanol (""You don't want me, but you can't stop me!""). Bankor represented the beneficiaries of TARP (""Oh no, I'm underwater, I need a bailout!""). After months of dormancy, after the Koch-funded Generation Opportunity had taken over the property, the Kronies returned in a cartoon about convincing dumb members of Congress to back Ex-Im. For a long time, as candidate Obama had demonstrated in 2008, it was liberals who opposed the bank. They'd scored points on corporations by asking if they were really so poor and beleaguered and ganged-up-on that they needed Uncle Sam to guarantee their sales. ""I think a lot of conservatives are keyed in on this issue now because the automatic expiration creates a situation where you can actually end a government program through inaction--which in this town is a whole lot easier than accomplishing something that required legislation,"" explains Phil Kerpen. ""There has always been hostility to Ex-Im among libertarians and free-marketeers, but Obama's lightning-rod loans to Solyndra and Petrobras have made it easier to message to a broader audience."" When you spend years crafting an argument, its success looks almost eerily speedy--almost accidental. On June 22, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the new House majority leader, stepped gently over Eric Cantor's corpse and told Fox News that he would kill the ""crony capitalism"" of Ex-Im. On June 25, Hensarling held a well-covered hearing on the bank, tarring it as a ""sweetheart deal"" that only benefited companies ""like Boeing, General Electric, Bechtel, and Caterpillar."" Republicans spent a day decrying ""crony capitalism."" Democrats, meanwhile, pleaded for everyone to imagine the horror of a world without Boeing. (Pause to consider the irony of Republicans attacking Boeing as Democrats defend it.) Less than a week later, in an NBC News interview, the roles had reversed so completely that Bill Clinton was chiding Republicans for even talking about ending Ex-Im. ""That's not a Wall Street crony capitalism deal!"" he said. ""That's a financing device that allows us to compete with the 60 other countries of the world who are trying to save jobs in their countries."" In six short years, the bank had gone from a Democratic target, to a quixotic libertarian target, to a political loser. The Chamber of Commerce was already watching immigration reform flail, thwarted by a Republican House it had helped elect. Now it is having to fight for Ex-Im? ""It's unfortunate that we have to do this in an election year,"" says Christopher Wenk, senior director of international policy at the Chamber of Commerce. ""This really is an inside-the-Beltway game that's being played right now. We're in a difficult place right now, but we're pushing. I don't sense that there's a massive grassroots opposition to Ex-Im. I sense there are groups in town that feel really strongly about Ex-Im."" The Chamber still might win the battle to save Ex-Im. Wenk explained that key Republicans (41 so far) have committed to Ex-Im in the House, which is enough if all Democrats join them. Even if the bank survives the vote, the Koch network and libertarians will have won the rhetorical battle, having put the onus of defending ""crony capitalism"" on Democrats. An issue too small to notice when Obama put it in a stump speech would have become a growing burden for his party. ""We at the Club think the small things matter,"" says Chris Chocola. ""If you can't accomplish the small things, you're never going to accomplish the big things."""
