It's after midnight at the Red Lion Casino. A country band has just packed up gear and split. Crabb, who works for a gold mining company nearby, has the next couple of days off. So he's sticking around, explaining how to heal American politics. ""Nobody gets re-elected,"" he says. ""Nobody. And there is no party. One term and you're out. No special interests, no lobbying."" Buck Dingey arrives at the bar. He's a security guard at the casino, just off the clock. ""I just heard you talking,"" he says. ""I'm of the frame of mind that the two-party system should be abolished."" They agree, and they keep talking. Crabb is going to see Ron Paul later in the day, then caucus for him on Saturday because ""there's not a lot of bullshit"" about him, and he has the right ideas about taxes and the Constitution. Dingey won't vote. There's no politician he trusts. ""If Obamacare gets in, we could literally pay a fine for not buying health insurance,"" Crabb continues. ""The way I see that is: Get health insurance, pay the bill, and Sieg Heil!"" He lifts his arm in a mock Nazi salute, accidentally showing off a tattoo of a naked woman he got on ""one bad night in the Philippines."" The government doesn't know how to solve problems, but he does. For example: Why not stop bailing out banks and cut checks to voters instead? ""You'd turn the housing market around in six months,"" says Crabb. The angry, anti-government sentiment is what you might expect from voters in a state leading the nation in unemployment and housing foreclosures. But there is one thing: Elko isn't in bad shape. The unemployment rate in Elko County is roughly half the rate in the rest of Nevada, three points lower than the national number. The gold mines, copper mines, and other sites down the road make this corner of the state one of the only economic booms of the Great Recession. ""Anyone who wants a job can get a job,"" says Crabb. It's a boom town, and it's as miserable as anywhere else. Among the miseries: The government wants more money from the mines. If you want to start a business, the obstacle course keeps getting longer. The government locks up too much land that nobody can properly use. For a long time, the people of Elko have dealt with this by voting for Republicans. In 2004, 78 percent of the county vote went to George W. Bush. As Bush's presidency and popularity cratered, Democrats saw an opening--they could win over enough of Elko's cynics to cut the GOP's margin. And it sort of worked, with the McCain-Palin ticket winning only 68 percent of the vote. It may not seem like a large dent, but Republicans need massive margins in places like Elko to overcome a Democratic stronghold like Las Vegas. The cynicism rolled right back after that. On Saturday, Ron Paul's campaign is aiming for a delegate surge in Nevada, helped by voter anger in places like Elko. Paul supporters, strong enough last time, have spent four years taking over the local party. But they're not winning converts because the economy is bad. So what is it? ""There's the public land thing,"" says Marla Criss. She's one of the Paul die-hards who served as one of his delegates last year, got burned by the GOP, which insisted the state's delegates go to McCain, and responded by taking over as Elko Republican chair. ""Over 90 percent of Nevada is public land. The Bureau of Public Land, and the park service, they're just getting worse and worse. There's a lot of support for Ron Paul when he says he wants to close down the Department of the Interior. I'd add that lots of Native Americans support him because the Bureau of Indian Affairs is part of Interior."" The government here is and always was considered a menace. The mining industry is booming now, sure, and this area's survived decades of busts and crazes, but the current boom looks like a validation of everything Ron Paul says. Precious metals are worth more because other investments aren't safe; gold is up because dollars aren't pegged to anything. Paul's ideas aren't just scripture for the people of Elko, they are reality. The newest villainy is coming from Nevadans United for Fair Mining Taxes, a business-backed group campaigning for an increase in the tax on mining. Right now, the tax is capped at 5 percent; if a ballot measure passes, or the state legislature approves it, the cap could go to 9 percent. ""The mining industry basically wrote our Constitution,"" says Bob Fulkerson, executive director of the group. ""The industry has done a really good job telling the workers, oh you're going to lose out if the tax goes up and it's wasted on social services. It's not true. Come on--they're not going to move the Carlin Trend""--one of the world's richest stretches of gold mining--""to some place with lower taxes."" Whether this plan passes or not, Elko will have voted against it. It's obvious: The political class is trying to suture and duct tape the budget together by taxing the people who make wealth. On Thursday, before Ron Paul's stop here, Elko's libertarians keep coming up with reasons to oppose this. ""The mines all pay their way in,"" says Lana Noland, a founder of the Elko Tea Party. ""They help with scholarships. My daughter, who just graduated--she's 22--she could get a scholarship and work with the mine for a while, make money. They have been so good to this community! Count up the donations, and it's thousands of dollars of fundraising. And yet, the liberal media presents them as not environmentalists, as bad for the community."" She sides with the mines over the government? ""I do. I see the wonderful reclamation they do, the help they give to communities all over Nevada. And the government wants more. More, more, more. It's greed."" Paul's rally takes place in a Native American rec center a short drive out of downtown. It is scheduled for 4:30, but the first fans start showing up at 3. Before Paul gets there, voters find seats on gym bleachers, grab Paul balloons and signs, and talk about what the government's taken from them. ""It used to be you could dig a hole and mine what you found there,"" says Walt Fisk, who's retired now. ""We mined everything: iron, mercury, copper."" ""For a while we supported three families off what we mined,"" says his wife Louise. They sit near another couple, Edgar and Sharon Nelson, who worry about Barack Obama ushering in a dictatorship if he wins again. Paul arrives, only a little late, to a crowd of more than 300 people. Four years ago, in all of Elko County, he only got 212 votes. He stands at a lectern, a barrier of plastic tables between him and the voters, and speaks without notes about how he'll make the government irrelevant. ""Our foreign enemies are not going to invade us,"" he says, ""but I'm concerned about our domestic enemies."" Plenty of heads nod at that one. ""There's nobody talking about it except for one candidate, and he happens to be in this room right now!"" There's time for four questions; the first one is about the proposed mine tax hike. Paul asks to hear it again. He gets the gist: He'd be against it. He's against the government exploiting people like that. ""Maybe they don't need to own the land,"" he says, ""and the people of Nevada need to own the land!"" Paul wraps up and gives reporters a few minutes of Q&A before he hops on a plane for Reno. After hearing so many people talk about it, I want to know where Paul is on mining profits. Should they be taxed at all? ""It's just like any other corporation,"" he says. ""The tax should be as low as possible. I want real low taxes. That's secondary to the problem of the welfare-warfare state. If you want to finance endless welfare, entitlements, and all these wars, you have to find all these gimmicks to finance it."" His answer is almost drowned out by noise. In a corner of the room, half a dozen twentysomethings from Idaho are screaming his name and shouting, ""Five hours! Five hours!""--how long they drove to see him. Paul finally obliges them, walking over to sign some fliers and pose for photos. His young fans are giddy. They celebrate in the parking lot, even as the sun falls and the temperature drops below 30 degrees. Idaho's holding its own caucus in a month, on Super Tuesday. They know how to fix it, too."	Ron Paul Country: Will Nevada's Boomtowns Fall for Paul?
1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/02/pot_legalization_why_doesn_t_anyone_in_washington_take_marijuana_policy_seriously_.html	"Potheads had high hopes for President Obama's Google+ hangout on Monday. The Web superpower had invited citizens to submit questions for the president via YouTube, and it encouraged people to vote on the questions they'd like Obama to answer in a live video chat. The results: 18 of the 20 most popular questions were about marijuana policy. The top vote-getter came from retired LAPD officer Stephen Downing, who said he's come to see the country's drug policies as ""a failure and a complete waste of criminal justice resources."" Pointing to a recent Gallup poll that showed, for the first time, a majority of Americans in support of marijuana legalization, he asked Obama, ""What do you say to this growing voter constituency that wants more changes to drug policy than you've delivered in your first term?"" Nothing, as it turned out. The question wasn't among those selected by Google. That's a bummer for the weed lobby but par for the course in Washington, where legalization remains a nonstarter despite fast-growing public support. In 1969, 12 percent of Americans thought pot should be legal. That percentage grew to the mid-20s by the late 1970s, passed 30 percent in 2000, and hit 40 percent in 2009, according to Gallup. A surprising October poll showed support at 50 percent, with just 46 percent against. While voters have mellowed out, their representatives in Congress haven't. A legalization bill was introduced in Congress last year for the first time, but few expect it to even come up for a vote. Its sponsors are Barney Frank and Ron Paul, legislators who have built their reputations by taking unpopular stands. Those with something to lose--like, say, an election--still won't touch the issue. When Obama did field a marijuana question in a YouTube chat last year, he laughed at it. ""I don't know what this says about the online audience,"" he chortled. Why won't the president, or anyone else in Washington, take marijuana policy seriously? Pro-legalization types see it as a mere matter of time before the government catches up to the rest of the country. ""The conventional wisdom for decades has been that this is a dangerous issue,"" activist Tom Angell told me. ""Behind the scenes people will say, 'I agree, you're totally right, we need to change these laws, but I'm afraid to say so.' For some reason it's still perceived as a political third rail."" A primary reason for lawmakers' reticence is that, for decades, the most visible advocates of looser weed laws have been, well, weed smokers--and what serious politician wants to be associated with a bunch of stoners, man? Earlier this decade, wealthy liberals like George Soros and Peter Lewis (once busted for pot-smoking himself) recognized that problem and shifted the debate to medical marijuana, giving the movement a more sympathetic public face: an ailing grandmother rather than a dreadlocked coach potato. Several states have since passed medical marijuana laws, but they don't address the bigger issue at play here. It's recreational users, not glaucoma patients, whose money fuels the illicit drug trade that finances criminal gangs. That's why Angell's group, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, has taken a different approach. It enlists cops and ex-cops to testify to the societal impacts of the failed drug war, pushing decriminalization and legalization as prudent policy solutions. It's an appeal to reason, not compassion. Downing, the former LAPD cop who asked the YouTube question, is a LEAP board member. The support his video got, from the public if not from Google, testifies to his message's broad appeal. While the tactic seems to be working in some liberal states, it has yet to make pot legalization safe for lawmakers in Washington. Anti-drug leaders see that as evidence that Angell is wrong when he argues that it's just a matter of time. Asa Hutchinson, the former Arkansas congressman who led the Drug Enforcement Administration under George W. Bush, told me he doesn't see a big difference in how the debate is playing out in Washington today as compared to 10 years ago. That may be partly a function of congressional demographics and partly a matter of incentives. Even if 50 percent of the public supports legalization, a pro-pot bill will never pass the Senate if those people are concentrated on the coasts. There's also the fact that potheads tend to be less likely to vote than senior citizens, who came of age in the pre-hippie era and have never inhaled. If legalization opponents are willing to back up their conviction at the ballot box, there's a lot of risk and little reward for a congressman to assume the marijuana mantle. Hutchinson proposed a different explanation for the perceived disconnect between Washington and public opinion: There's not actually a disconnect. Asked by a pollster whether they support legalization, Hutchinson says, voters may shrug and say, ""Why not?"" But ask them just how legalized marijuana should be regulated, how it should be taxed, and whether it should be sold at the corner store in their neighborhood, and they'll quickly change their tune. That seemed to happen even in liberal California, where a referendum on legalized marijuana failed in 2010 in part because voters worried about the mechanisms for ensuring proper oversight. There may be something to that. It's extremely rational to oppose the excesses of the drug war. Harsh sentences for marijuana possession are a big reason that U.S. prisons are teeming with poor, young blacks (who are far more likely to be arrested for marijuana use than middle-class whites). Decriminalizing possession, or at least lightening sentences, seems to be an idea whose time is coming. But legalizing marijuana? That may still be further than the average American, upon reflection, wants to go. A 2010 study by the nonprofit RAND Corporation suggested that legalizing marijuana in California would send pot prices plummeting and consumption soaring. The impact on the state budget would likely be a net positive, but not enough to make a big dent in the Golden State's financial crisis. And for all the efforts of groups like LEAP, there's still the Cheech and Chong factor. One of the RAND paper's authors, psychologist and U.C.-Berkeley law professor Robert MacCoun, argued that pot's place in pop culture makes it hard for even generally supportive people to take the issue seriously. (As a marijuana policy researcher, MacCoun says, he can't grab a snack at a party without someone joking about the munchies.) That sets marijuana legalization apart from other socially liberal causes, such as gay marriage, with which an impassioned moral appeal can resonate deeply even with those inclined to oppose it. All that said, it's clear time is on the smokers' side. The pre-baby boom generation--the country's last to grow up believing that marijuana was more likely to cause rape, insanity, and suicide than it was to promote passing out on the couch--won't be a political factor much longer. Today's middle-aged voters came of age in the 1970s, when marijuana use was even more common than it is today. Some may harbor reservations about laws that allow their kids and grandkids to follow their lead as tokers, but they're far less likely than their parents to lump weed in the same category as more destructive drugs like heroin and cocaine. It won't happen today, and it won't happen in the next four years. Eventually, though, we'll have our first weed-legalization president."	Why Doesn't Anyone in Washington Take Marijuana Legalization Seriously?

Mitt Romney won the crucial state big with 46 percent of the vote, beating Gingrich by 14 points. In Brevard County, where Gingrich's pledge to build a lunar colony might have wooed voters who worked in the space industry, Romney won by 7 points. Inevitability restored. Romney has won snowbird victories in New Hampshire and Florida. He won Florida with almost 50 percent of the vote, a key psychological threshold for a candidate whose detractors once said he had a ceiling of 25 percent. Romney now rolls on with bragging rights: He dominated the biggest contest to date in a state that is representative of the Republican coalition and that is the largest contested prize in the general election. And he rolls on with wheels that are made of money. As the Florida polls were closing, his campaign announced that it had raised $24 million in the fourth quarter to Gingrich's nearly $10 million. Romney has $20 million in the bank he can use. Romney won by vast margins on the two key questions of the election. According to exit polls, among the 45 percent of voters who wanted someone who was in the best position to beat Obama, Romney won 58 percent to Gingrich's 32 percent. Among the 62 percent for whom the economy was the number one issue, Romney won 52 percent to Gingrich's 29. Romney's strongest argument will be that he was able to win with conservatives. Though both candidates are insiders, Newt Gingrich tried to make Romney's support within the party a liability. He tried to turn the race into a battle between the establishment and the grassroots. It was people power versus money power, said Gingrich (whose campaign has been aided by $10 million in donations from Sheldon Adelson). Exit polls suggest that the argument didn't work. Romney won by four percentage points over Gingrich among the 65 percent of voters who say they are supporters of the Tea Party. He won by a similar margin among the 65 percent who call themselves conservatives. Gingrich won those who considered themselves ""very conservative"" and those who ""strongly identify"" with the Tea Party. Romney even challenged Gingrich in north Florida, a conservative stronghold. Gingrich's argument for continuing his campaign--which he pledged to do tonight--is that he enjoys strong support in the American South. But the panhandle mirrors the South as much as any portion of Florida. Negative ads worked. Romney dumped $16 million of negative ads into the state. Gingrich said he thought Romney's aggression would backfire. It didn't work. Voters thought both candidates aired unfair ads, but of those that thought so of Romney, a far larger proportion voted for him anyway. Also, in the last three days before the election, late-deciding voters went with Romney, suggesting that instead of penalizing him as Gingrich had hoped, they rushed into his arms. The contest coming into Florida was between Romney's money and organization and Gingrich's momentum. Money and organization won out. Romney was on the airwaves beating on Gingrich in early January when there wasn't much competition. This might have locked in voters. Florida voters made up their minds earlier than in other states. (Only 28 percent said they decided in the last three days; in previous states the number was almost twice as much.) If the ads didn't do it, Romney's superior ground game did. His team started working the absentee and early voters in mid-December. Romney won that vote by a wide margin. Romney won the 15 percent Hispanic vote 54 to 28. Gingrich had tried to make Romney's tough anti-illegal immigration position an issue, but it didn't work. That may be because the vote in Florida consists largely of Cubans, who are shielded from immigration policies that apply to other immigrants, and of Puerto Ricans, who are U.S. citizens. Romney also won among women by 24 points. The biggest blow for Gingrich is that exit polls show that just 55 percent of the voters view him favorably. Gingrich's big problem has always been that his low favorability rating with independent and swing voters makes it very hard for him to win the general election. That he can barely get a majority among his own tribe highlights how hard it would be for him as the GOP nominee. Seventy-four percent of voters had a favorable view of Romney. Gingrich will argue that if you add the Santorum vote to his it shows that the anti-Romney vote almost totals what Romney won. But elections don't work that way. Polling in Florida showed that Santorum's voters would split equally between Gingrich and Romney if their man fell out of the race. Teresa Ruiz is one such voter. At a Romney rally in Halijah, Fla., she said she wanted to vote for Santorum but didn't think he could beat Obama so she went with Romney. ""I wanted to go with my heart,"" she said, ""but I went with my head instead."" Romney emerges a stronger candidate. He certainly showed he was willing to do what it takes, for those voters who might worry about whether he was tough enough to go up against Obama. The terrain is now very favorable as Romney heads into contests in Nevada, Michigan, Colorado, and Minnesota. He won all four of those in 2008. The next contest where Gingrich might have a good chance is almost a month from now, on Super Tuesday. There is only one debate in that stretch. The Romney camp was hoping for a victory big enough to start calls for an end to the bruising contest, and they got one. Romney still needs 1,054 more delegates. Gingrich has vowed to fight on. He can argue that the northern counties where he won resemble the southern states that will vote on Super Tuesday. But the pressure will build for Gingrich to get out of the race. Obama is vulnerable. The Gallup 2011 average of Obama's approval rating in 12 swing states was 43 percent--dangerous territory for an incumbent. So don't blow it, Romney's backers will argue, by dragging out the primary fight. Romney's image with independents has already been dinged by the process. His unfavorable ratings among independents went up 15 points in a recent Washington Post poll. Such arguments aren't likely to convince Gingrich. His favorite story is of Washington's battle near Trenton, N.J., in which the soldiers marched on despite losses and a lack of footwear. ""If you're not yet walking in a burlap bag you don't have much of an excuse,"" he has said about enduring political struggles. In his speech after the vote Gingrich promised to pledge his ""life"" and his ""sacred honor"" to the country if he won. He did not sound like a man who was going to give up marching"	Romney Deals Gingrich Crushing Blow, Restores Inevitability in Florida Win
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/01/the_keystone_xl_pipeline_the_the_latest_reason_for_republican_voters_to_hate_president_obama_.html	"THE VILLAGES, Fla.--Newt Gingrich's schedule, 72 hours before the Florida primary, goes like this: church, parking lot of a retirement mega-city, church. His only speech of the day is here, in a grove of tidy homes and souped-up golf carts. As the Villagers stand, or sit in their chairs, or stay in their carts to sip Arizona Iced Tea or frappes, Gingrich explains why Barack Obama is failing them. ""He recently vetoed the Keystone pipeline,"" says Gingrich. Boo! Boo! Boo! ""Now, think about it! He did it to appease left-wing environmental extremists in San Francisco."" Ugh, mutters a retiree near the press riser. Gingrich laid on the scares with a trowel; an ugh was the least he could do. ""Think about what would come of this,"" Gingrich continues. ""Here was an opportunity to have oil come from Canada through the United States, to the largest petrochemical complex in the world, in Houston. It would have provided jobs for the next 50 years, processing the oil, sending some of it to the ports overseas, so you'd got jobs for the ports, jobs for the refineries, jobs from building the pipeline. He canceled all that. Right now the Canadians are looking seriously at a partnership with China."" From what I could gather, Gingrich's audience knew about the Keystone XL pipeline before he started talking. They felt the same way he did. ""For Obama not to do it is a disgrace to this country,"" said Bob Levens, a retiree with his shoulder in a sling--a necessity before surgery on some torn muscles. (Consolation prize: Rick Santorum had signed the sling.) ""He is stopping the workforce and the energy that we need right now. I don't know where his thinking is. He's giving $1 billion to George Soros to start buying oil from South America, from Hugo Chavez."" Jim Oddie, a scuba instructor who'd driven an hour to see Gingrich, ticked off the reasons Obama might have nixed the pipeline. ""He doesn't play for our team,"" he said. ""He wasn't raised in the mainland of the United States. He doesn't think America is exceptional. Come on--he grew up in Hawaii in 1961 when it had been a state for less than two years. Spent time in Indonesia."" If Newt Gingrich loses Florida, his attacks and tweaks and talking points will be written off; they didn't work. That's the wrong way to think about Gingrich. If he loses, he's returning to the role he held before his presidential bid: a pundit with a psychic bond to the conservative base and a knack for explaining what they should be scared of. The Keystone panic is a perfect example, one that will last and last. It's not even up to Gingrich--Republicans in Congress are hugging the pipeline so tight that it's squeaking. House Republicans want to keep attaching pipeline approval to must-pass bills. Sen. John Hoeven, a North Dakota Republican, wants to pull the power of approval from the executive to the legislative branch. In his ""State of the Union response,"" a speech given in Tampa under a giant ""OBAMA ISN'T WORKING"" banner, Mitt Romney called Keystone ""a real 'shovel-ready' project that would put 20,000 Americans back to work."" This is a general election message, even if Gingrich doesn't get to the general election. So we have a winning campaign line, three parts attitude to one part facts. The facts: The pipeline delay was a big victory for environmentalists (some of whom live outside of San Francisco). The delay does push approval past the election, and if Obama's re-elected, TransCanada will probably have to come up with an alternate route. Nixing the pipeline meant nixing some number of construction jobs; labor unions were arm-in-arm with energy companies, predicting 20,000 careers if the pipeline went from Alberta to Houston, not Alberta to Vancouver. But the pipeline means so much more. ""I'll tell you what I really think,"" said Beth Campbell, after she, Gingrich, and a few thousand other people attended a church service in Lutz, Fla. ""He wants us to be dependent on foreign countries."" Mary Gaulden, a Republican activist who got a picture with Gingrich after the service, explained why Obama's lack of faith led him astray. ""We don't need regulators, we don't need the EPA,"" she said. ""God created this world. He put resources here so that we could use them."" Back in the Villages, a retiree named Gerald Franck explained the pipeline delay as an example of Obama ""sabotaging"" the country, on purpose. This is petro-populism, something Gingrich has always been good at. Sarah Palin gets all the credit, but it was Gingrich who kicked off the ""drill, baby, drill"" meme. His slogan, expanded (of course) into a book, was ""drill here, drill now, pay less."" After he coined that phrase, oil companies cut Adelson-sized checks for his 527, helping to fund a campaign much more credible-sounding than, say, the American Petroleum Institute ads that play between Sunday talk shows. Energy companies wanted something; voters wanted it, too. The trick of any good industry campaign is to blur the relationship so that no one takes credit, and to make the idea so powerful that anyone who's opposed is addled, on the take, or worse. Their argument is tauter than the Democrats' argument. The oil-for-China line, for example--it's clever to say that oil prices depend on where the boats take the barrels, not on the overall amount of oil in the market. At the Villages, as the stage and equipment is packed away, Jim Oddie explains it in baseball terms. ""You remember Pete Rose?"" he asks. ""He's banned from baseball, banned from the Hall of Fame, because he bet on his team to win. Obama's supposed to be the manager of our team. And he bets against it."	The Keystone XL Pipeline: The Latest Reason for Republican Voters To Hate Obama

Republican members of Congress have scaled back public town hall meetings, chastened by the screams that embarrassed the old Democratic Congress. Powerful Democrats, meanwhile, get ""mic-checked"" by Occupy protesters. And three of the four remaining Republican presidential candidates--Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, and Newt Gingrich--are constantly on alert for hecklers. (Nobody seems to heckle Ron Paul; perhaps it's unconstitutional.) Handle a heckler well, and you collect prizes. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie started to go Don Rickles on people who acted out at his events--voila, instant national stardom. Handle a heckler poorly, and you end up like Ben Konop, once a rising Ohio politico, now famous for this clip in which a guy boos him for three minutes. And be warned, Gov. Christie: A politician who perceives himself as skillful at fending off audience attacks could be putting himself in danger of becoming the next George Allen. Romney, Santorum, and Gingrich handle crowd eruptions in completely different ways. Whose strategy is best? I asked two stand-up comedians, Rob Delaney and Paul F. Tompkins, to apply their expertise to the question. Rick Santorum The winner-by-a-fingernail of the Iowa caucuses draws a very specific kind of heckle: the gay rights bellow. Ever since Santorum warned of incipient ""man on dog"" relations if gay marriage was legalized, pro-gay voters have daydreamed about humiliating him. At Santorum's final pre-vote event in New Hampshire, I watched as stunt candidate Vermin Supreme (a Democrat, technically) put his bullhorn on a window and warned of human-canine intercourse happening outside. At a much more widely broadcast event, Santorum refused to concede an argument about gay marriage to a group of college students. What do we learn? Santorum hears a heckler and senses an argument he can win--even if the crowd isn't with him. He uncorks the kind of hyper-confident verbal assault that defined his Senate career, the same impulse that leads him to take eight minutes to answer a town hall question. He knows that the heckler hates him for ideological reasons; to win, he will deploy the facts he's honed for years, stuff the heckler won't know how to answer. The problem, according to our experts: Santorum won't just win the argument and move on. ""He barely wins against an emotional crowd,"" says Tompkins, ""with an argument that could have been torn apart had the crowd actually expected him to have an argument. Maybe they forgot that homosexuality and abortion are Rick Santorum's twin muses, and thoughts of them are never very far. In the end, he blows it by staying out there long enough to get booed. He should have thrown the mic down and walked off."" Mitt Romney The richest candidate in the race draws the most Occupy protests. I've watched 99 percenters bum rush Romney three different times, once in Iowa and twice in New Hampshire. The Iowa confrontation was instantly legendary--Romney started taking questions at the state fair, got into it with liberal activists, and told one of them that ""corporations are people."" Romney is slippery--hard to pin down, no matter how strong the heckle. When he's interrupted, he has a long defense of capitalism ready to go, the words ready to be rearranged in whatever order fits. He bounced off the Iowa heckle to make a campaign promise: ""I won't raise your taxes."" In New Hampshire, he belittled the heckler as un-American, and moved right on. It's a microcosm of his entire campaign strategy, a reliance on facts and zingers that are lab-tested for conservative voters. ""He's smart, he knows his stuff, he's aggressive,"" says Delaney, pointing to the Iowa video. ""He shows humility in his awareness concerning the fact that people present at the gathering will not vote for him and he finishes with a hearty salvo cut from his stump speech. He is, in essence, a bad MF in that video. Not that I'd vote for him in 1,000 years, but anybody who's not impressed with him after that performance has never spoken to a crowd."" Newt Gingrich His presidential campaign has evolved in stages, from collapse to surge to collapse to surge. His response to hecklers has evolved, too. When he was struggling, Newt blew off hecklers by pretending they weren't there. (Michele Bachmann is/was a believer in the same method.) At a town hall for Hispanic voters in New Hampshire, I watched Newt keep his voice at the highest polite volume as Occupiers marched outside, taunting him, audible through the walls. The post-New Hampshire Gingrich--the one who elbowed past Romney to win South Carolina--is a happy heckler-defanger. Presidential campaigns are serious things, and hecklers, like debate moderators, are unserious. At an event in Tampa, I watched him respond with pure snark to a heckler who doubted that he was a Reagan conservative: ""Did you know Ronald Reagan?"" In Coral Springs, he took the same approach. Did this idiot know what she was getting into? He'd teach her. ""He handles it like a pro,"" says Tompkins. ""You don't cut the heckler off. You let her go. Give 'em enough rope. Use the time she's babbling to craft your comeback. Then BAM. You unleash your zinger with a smile. They come at you again? Same thing. Keep indulging her until the crowd completely turns on the heckler. Which they will--you've been smiling the while time, letting her say her piece, right? The crowd can't be mad at you--you're just being polite in a funny way! But just insulting enough that they taste a little blood in their mouths! THIS WOMAN MUST BE SILENCED AND THEY WILL GLADLY DO THAT FOR YOU! GUARDS, SEIZE HER!"" Tompkins argues that Gingrich is the best heckler-defanger of the three; Delaney says it's Romney. I'm inclined to agree with Delaney, because Romney hews so closely to his script that a small dose of WTF makes him sound fresh. In a series of heckler confrontations, Romney produced one quasi-gaffe: the ""corporations are people"" line. But that's not too different from the gaffes he makes whenever he's asked about money. Alone among the candidates, the hatred of hecklers actually brings out Romney's best."	Stand-Up Comics Evaluate How Well Rick Santorum, Mitt Romney, and Newt Gingrich Handle Hecklers

The one who got wealthy working the inside Washington game is whaling away at the one who got wealthy working the angles of high finance. The economic diversity at the top of the Republican field runs the gamut from A to B. In the 2010 election, Florida was the epicenter of the struggle in the Republican Party between insiders and outsiders. Tea Party insurgent Marco Rubio won a Senate seat by trouncing establishment candidate Charlie Crist. But despite the outsider movement that briefly emboldened the Rick Perry and Herman Cain candidacies, the Republican primary has come down to a battle between two insiders. Whether Mitt Romney or Newt Gingrich wins the Florida primary on Jan. 31, it will be a triumph for men who have profited from knowing how to work the system. All politicians who run for president have some sort of insider connection. Barack Obama owns a house that is the product of a cozy deal with convicted Chicago real estate mogul Tony Rezko. He has stocked his administration with Wall Street insiders. The public has grown increasingly suspicious about any kind of insider taint, believing that those with favored positions both fail to see what is wrong in Washington and on Wall Street, and unfairly benefited from bailouts. Newt Gingrich has as much of this insider taint as he does personal taint. He was a longtime politician. Bad. He traded on that political experience to make money helping companies work the system. Bad. One of the companies was Freddie Mac, a villain for Tea Party Republicans in the 2008 economic collapse. Bad. It's no surprise that Mitt Romney has been hammering Gingrich on this front since the campaign moved to Florida. Mitt Romney's career in private equity: Also bad. It makes him vulnerable to the charge that he is a part of the system that led to the economic collapse. Disclosure of his tax returns also highlights his insider status. He can afford to work the system to his advantage through tax avoidance in a way that very few ordinary Americans can. The Gingrich campaign circulated an article this week arguing that Romney's insider status meant he'd never be able to go after the troubled banks that caused so much economic distress. On Thursday, Gingrich made that attack himself: Let's be clear, you're watching ads paid for with the money taken from the people of Florida by companies like Goldman Sachs, recycled back into ads to try to stop you from having a choice in this election. ... What level of gall does it take to think that we collectively are so stupid that somebody who owns lots of stock in Fannie and Freddie Mac, somebody who owns lots of stock in Goldman Sachs, who is insistently foreclosing on Floridians, who is surrounded by lobbyists who are already protecting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, can then build his entire negative campaign in Florida around a series of ads that are just plain false? Yet neither candidate thinks his own insider status is a problem. Indeed, they're each running on it. They just call it ""experience."" Gingrich argues that his time in Washington gives him special insight how to turn his grand promises into effective action. Romney argues that even his failures in the business world help him understand how to turn around the economy. Why is Gingrich getting the better of this insider battle at the moment? Appearing to be an outsider is more important than actually being one. Newt Gingrich is vastly better at this than Romney. There is nothing conventional or establishment about the Gingrich campaign. It's messy and rugged and risky. Gingrich consistently trounces his opposition among Tea Party voters in polls and exit polls. Gingrich is also helped by attacks on him by establishment figures: John McCain, Trent Lott, and a parade of former and current officials who populate the daily Romney campaign conference calls savaging Gingrich. Thursday afternoon, even Bob Dole took a swing at Gingrich. Dole is like many in Washington who grumble about Gingrich, can't believe he's doing so well, and don't want him to be president, but had assumed he'd collapse from his own hubris. ""I have not been critical of Newt Gingrich, but it is now time to take a stand before it is too late. If Gingrich is the nominee it will have an adverse impact on Republican candidates running for county, state, and federal offices. Hardly anyone who served with Newt in Congress has endorsed him and that fact speaks for itself. He was a one-man-band who rarely took advice. It was his way or the highway."" Bob Dole was the Mitt Romney of his day, an establishment figure the grassroots didn't like much. Same with John McCain. George H.W. Bush dislikes Gingrich intensely and has unofficially endorsed Mitt Romney. If Gingrich is really lucky, Bush will make his endorsement official."	Gingrich and Romney Are Both Consummate Insiders. So Why Is Only Gingrich Able To Portray Himself as an Outsider?

A long speech can pack in proposals that are law already (a ban on congressional insider trading!) and lines that were demo'd, then ignored, in old SOTUs. The expectations for Tuesday's speech were especially low. They got lower when Republicans pre-emptively called it ""pathetic"" (Rep. John Boehner) or the ""final"" SOTU of a one-term president (Rep. Jason Chaffetz). You can work with low expectations. The president's task was to give a speech that 1) made his general election argument while 2) portraying Republicans as unpatriotic obstructionists and 3) mentioning a couple of bills that may actually pass. For the last time this year, the opposition party had to sit there and take it. 8:43: The rows alongside the entrance to the House floor have been occupied for hours. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee. Rep. Louie Gohmert. Rep. Jean Schmidt. It's the same people every year. There's Rep. Eliot Engel, who has admitted that the seat-squat makes him famous. ""Six months from now, someone will say to me, 'Congressman, I saw you on TV,' "" he said, ""and I'll think it was in a brilliant interview ... what was I saying? And they'll say, 'No, no, you were shaking the president's hand.' "" He didn't seem to be ashamed by this. Before the speech starts, he fields phone calls, settled in his chair as if he was about to captain the Enterprise. 8:53: For the second year, a clutch of Democrats and Republicans are sitting together, declaring small wars on partisanship. There's Sen. John Hoeven next to Sen. Amy Klobuchar! Look, Sen. Jeff Sessions is discussing something with Sen. Ron Wyden! Rep. Peter King and Rep. Charles Rangel still get along. They all stand when their inspiration arrives--Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, the survivor of a bullet to the head, who's retiring this week to keep recuperating. Rep. Jeff Flake, an arch-conservative who might once have challenged her for a Senate seat, keeps her steady as she waves, pumps her fist, and talks with well-wishers. Louie Gohmert, possibly the most right-wing member of the House, temporarily abandons his aisle seat to share a moment with Giffords. 9:00: The president's Cabinet arrives. Dozens of Republicans have asked for Attorney General Eric Holder to resign. He deftly moves right past them, shaking hands with Democrats. 9:05: The president himself arrives. Eliot Engel gets a fantastic piece of video. 9:12: The speech begins with the oldest trick of the pseudo-event, an appeal to the troops (""this generation of heroes"") that gets everyone on their feet, clapping. Then he mentions that there are ""no Americans fighting in Iraq."" Some hands, including the ones belonging to Joe Lieberman, stay on laps. 9:18: Obama tells a capsule history of the recession--4 million lost jobs before he took over, four million more ""before our policies were in full effect."" There's good news: In two years ""businesses have created more than three million jobs."" Only Democrats clap when he says this. The most enthused is Rep. Shelley Berkley, who is sitting in a sea of Republicans, wearing a pinkish blazer, standing out like a birthday candle. 9:21: Obama declares victory in the war to save General Motors. ""What's happening in Detroit can happen in other cities,"" he says, and Rep. Hansen Clarke, a freshman who represents much of the city, applauds totally alone. 9:27: ""If the playing field is level,"" says Obama, ""America will always win."" For the first time, Rep. Eric Cantor applauds and rises on his heels. He'd been staring right through the president, reacting as little as his facial muscles would let him. 9:40: The president suggests that America needs an ""all-of-the-above energy strategy."" The room explodes, because the entire GOP conference is exhaling with a loud ""HEYYYYYYYYYY!"" Cantor breaks into a smile, teeth gleaming from across the room. 9:49: Obama needs to discuss the curse of burdensome regulation, so he tells a joke about an old rule that tortured dairy farmers. ""With a rule like that,"" he says, ""I guess it was worth crying over spilled milk."" A shudder goes around the chamber; Rep. Chaffetz mimes a rim shot. 9:53: Obama praises the recess-appointed head of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, Richard Cordray. Republicans seethe, with one exception. Cordray's predecessor, too hated by the GOP to get a vote, was Elizabeth Warren. When she opted out of the confirmation fight, she declared her candidacy for U.S. Senate in Massachusetts. The incumbent: Sen. Scott Brown. He's applauding. 10:01: ""Send me a bill that bans insider trading by members of Congress,"" says Obama, ""and I will sign it."" Rep. Billy Long, a former auctioneer who's the size and shape of a rum barrel, gets up and thrusts his arm, shouting, ""Wooooooo!"" We might have a bill that can pass. 10:14: Obama closes by comparing Congress unfavorably with the SEAL Team that killed bin Laden. (Who could survive the comparison?) Why, when Obama presided over the mission, he worked alongside with a Republican secretary of defense and ""Hillary Clinton, a woman who ran against me for president."" Clinton, who has been nodding and smiling at the shrimpiest menu items, laughs and nods harder. 10:49: The president has left the building. The members of Congress who can stand it are in Statuary Hall, not far from the chamber, where they can give short responses to waiting cameras. An employee of Fox walks around with candy: ""We like to bribe our guests,"" he jokes. Rep. Trent Franks is raging against the speech. ""This president has a skill for saying things that have no logical connection to what he's doing."" Why did he, and every Republican, stand and cheer for that ""all of the above"" energy line? ""Because that was our quote, and he appropriated it. He's not acting on it at all."" Sen. Mike Lee, a former Samuel Alito clerk, walks right past Franks. (For the second year since being criticized over the Citizens United decision, Alito skipped the speech.) Lee couldn't believe that the president rubbed in his recess appointment. ""Were it not for decorum, I would have done something when he said that,"" he says. ""It would not have been applause."""	The Liveliest Moments From the State of the Union: Spilled Milk and Congressional Insider Trading
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/01/tampa_debate_romney_attacked_gingrich_was_ineffective.html	"Florida is a haven for retirees, and Newt Gingrich seemed like one during the GOP debate in Tampa Monday night. Instead of the firebrand he's been in the previous seventeen outings, he was in a constant state of repose, ducking attacks, tolerating moderators, and generally just paddling around in the shallow waves hoping for a nice soak. Mitt Romney was shark-like: He wore a permanent smile and attacked with emotionless precision. In New Hampshire, Newt Gingrich was on the attack and Mitt Romney remained cool and calm. In Florida the relationship has reversed. The Romney campaign prides itself on its long view. It has a game plan for a protracted primary fight. But the tense and relentless Romney looked like a man unsure that everything was going according to plan. In the end, it was probably his night. But it was a brittle, shaky victory that probably won't change the dynamic much. Romney attacked Gingrich immediately and went for every artery. Twice he said Gingrich ""resigned in disgrace."" He accused the former speaker of influence-peddling, called him a creature of K Street and reminded viewers that he had palled around with Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi while criticizing Republican House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan. Romney has clearly cracked the seal on the Destroy Newt briefing book. Gingrich is running as a Washington outsider. Romney called B.S. (Or as he says it: Golly No!) He kept pointing out that Gingrich's initial claim that he had provided advice ""as a historian,"" was laughable. ""I don't think we can possibly retake the White House if the person who's leading our party is the person who was working for the chief lobbyist of Freddie Mac."" It was obvious that Mitt was making inroads because Gingrich, one of the best attack politicians around, let out a little whimper. ""You know, there is a point in the process where it gets unnecessarily personal and nasty. And that's sad."" (In fact, he sounded a bit like Romney had when he bemoaned the attacks on his integrity in the last debate in South Carolina.) Gingrich is skilled at jujitsu. In the last debate, he turned his second wife's claims about his adultery into a star debate moment. A creature of Washington, he is running strong as the outsider. But in Tampa, he was not able to successfully redirect the ""influence peddling"" accusations. His defense, which lingered on electric cooperatives and the difference between gross revenue and personal income, seemed obtuse. Just as Mitt Romney--who may never have worked on Wall Street--is of Wall Street, Gingrich--not a technical lobbyist--is a part of the influence-peddling game. It was clear that Romney's attacks irritated Gingrich. ""I understand your technique,"" he said at end of their most pointed exchange. But he never bestirred himself. Nothing was declared stupid and he didn't get within miles of zany. At one point he did say Romney was a ""lousy historian"" for giving the incorrect date for the vote to reprimand him--a technical point that was lost on probably everyone. Gingrich seemed stuck at the tail end of an exhale throughout the night. He not only didn't defend himself terribly well, he failed to rouse his fans. In previous states he has won the secular ""amen"" vote because that's what people say to the television when he lands a verbal blow. They were scarce tonight. He did have one good moment though at the tail end of his set-to with Romney. ""They're not sending somebody to Washington to manage the decay,"" Mr. Gingrich said, in a rare moment when he broke his zen. ""They're sending somebody to Washington to change it, and that requires somebody who's prepared to be controversial when necessary."" In the end, Romney took a variety of facts, mastered them, and pressed the case against a formidable opponent repeatedly. If GOP voters are looking for someone who can battle Obama in debates, Romney showed that he has skills beyond merely repeating that he has been in the private sector. Despite this strong offense, Romney was still weak on defense. He continues to have trouble talking about his tax returns without giving the feeling that he is simultaneously looking for a back door to escape the discussion entirely. When asked if he would release his taxes beyond the last year or so as his father did, Romney said he would not. ""You know, I agree with my dad on a lot of things, but we also disagree. And--and going out with 12 years of returns is not something I'm going to do."" Wow, a moment of disagreement with the father he so revered. There must be some deep principle involved. Romney has never offered one. Rick Santorum had another strong debate. He took on both of the men who are ahead of him in the polls. ""If you believe in capitalism,"" he asked his rivals, ""why did you support the bailout of Wall Street?"" His closing answer promoted himself as the real conservative who won't bend under pressure. ""When push came to shove, they got pushed,"" he said. ""They rejected conservatism when it was hard to stand."" Though there were several pointed exchanges, in the end, the Tampa debate was tepid. The audience did not applaud, which gave the candidates nothing to feed on. The four men also all looked like they were sweating, making the event feel like the last stage in a brutal endurance contest. No such luck. There's another debate Thursday."	Dickerson: In Tampa Debate, Romney Shows He Can Throw a Punch
8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/01/gingrich_wins_south_carolina_how_can_romney_recover_from_his_terrible_defeat_.html	"South Carolina went ""Grandiose."" Newt Gingrich, who embraced that word when it was used to describe him, won the Republican primary handily today with around 40 percent of the vote. Mitt Romney, who had been ahead by double digits in polls after the New Hampshire primary, received only 27 percent. Given Gingrich's overwhelming victory, it may be difficult for him to find a historical figure important enough to compare himself to. Mitt Romney's smooth trip to the nomination has been interrupted. He has lost two of three contests. Voters have ratified the long-standing doubts about him. The non-Romney voters who had been splitting their vote now seem to have settled on Gingrich. The surge we've all been sensing for Gingrich seems to be real. There were a lot of late deciders--53 percent--and 44 percent of them went for Gingrich. The debates did it. Sixty-five percent of voters said the debates mattered in helping them make their decision, and half of those voters went for Gingrich. Republicans have long scoffed at Barack Obama's rhetorical skills, but in South Carolina, exit polls make it clear that Gingrich owes his surge to rhetoric. The Romney and Santorum campaigns have hammered him on his volatile personality and his chaotic leadership style. They've said that voters would be sorry in the fall when Gingrich loses to President Obama, or if Gingrich wins and then flames out in office. Those attacks didn't work. Mitt Romney has been making two points about his candidacy. He is the more electable candidate, and he can turn the economy around. According to exit polls, Gingrich ate away at these two core parts of the Romney pitch. Forty-five percent of South Carolina voters said beating Obama was the most important attribute they wanted in a candidate. Gingrich won that group with 48 percent of the vote to Romney's 39 percent. For the 63 percent who said the economy was the most important issue, Gingrich beat Romney 39 to 33. Sixty-three percent of the voters said they were evangelical Christians or born again. They went for Gingrich decisively, giving him 43 percent of the vote. That's the same share of the vote that Mike Huckabee won in 2008. He is an ordained minister. Newt Gingrich has been married three times and admitted committing adultery--and his second-wife's accusations about his request for an ""open marriage"" resurfaced days before the vote. None of that mattered. Mitt Romney, who has been married to his first and only wife for more than 40 years, got only 22 percent of the evangelical vote, half of Gingrich's share (though double his 2008 performance).
 
Evangelical voters did not see Gingrich's personal shortcomings as an impediment. Neither did women, who also voted for him over Romney. South Carolina Republican strategists have scratched their heads a little at this. ""These are people who judged Bill Clinton,"" said one Republican strategist about social values voters. But the consensus view among those in GOP politics here is that Republican voters had already discounted Gingrich's personal failings. One poll also suggested that Republicans did not believe the latest charges from Gingrich's ex-wife. Evangelical leaders who gathered in Texas to throw their support behind Rick Santorum a week ago also took a hit. Santorum, the choice of those conservative elites, pulled only 19 percent of the evangelical vote. For the 26 percent who said the candidates' religious beliefs mattered a great deal, Santorum was not the favorite. Gingrich beat Santorum 43 percent to 31 percent. Voters also appeared to discount worries about Gingrich's volatility. Gingrich is a volatile politician. His history tells us that. His campaign so far has told us that. For four days before the vote in South Carolina, the Romney campaign had been highlighting these facts. ""Unreliable leader,"" they called him. Then, the statements from Marianne Gingrich surfaced. It was the kind of unexpected explosion that Gingrich's rivals had been warning about. Yet it didn't hurt.
 
Romney won among ""moderate or liberal"" voters, those opposed to the Tea Party movement, nonreligious and voters who make over $200k (half of what Romney was paid for speeches). Not exactly the GOP coalition. Romney will have to do a better job pitching the core message of his candidacy and tearing down Gingrich. In his post-election speech, Romney compared Gingrich to Obama. Neither has run a business or a state; Both engage in class warfare and attack free enterprise. ""Those who pick up the weapons of the left today will find them used against them tomorrow,"" said Romney. The question for Gingrich is now how he turns his shoestring campaign into a bigger operation. In Florida, the next primary state, campaigns have to rely on television, not public appearances. The Speaker will have to rely on a big infusion of cash to compete with the negative ads attacking him. Negative messages are already flooding mailboxes. Gingrich will also have to race to catch up with Mitt Romney's stronger organization. Momentum may overcome those disadvantages. Gingrich has considerable vulnerabilities that Romney must exploit to convince voters that Gingrich would lose in the general election. The former speaker is unpopular nationally and with independent voters. He is also unpopular in his own party. In New Hampshire exit polls, more than 60 percent said they would not be happy if he were the nominee.  National polls show the same thing. In a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll, 23 percent of Republicans said they would not support him. Only Ron Paul did worse. Women voters, an important swing voting bloc, do not like Gingrich. Gingrich's dramatic victory capped a zany few days of politics: Stormy debates, accusations from Newt Gingrich's ex-wife, Rick Perry's dropout, and a reversal in the Iowa caucus results. With all of that upheaval, it was fitting that on Election Day, severe weather knocked out power at some South Carolina polling places and residents in some counties were under a tornado watch for much of the day. If you live in Florida, you might want to batten down the hatches."	Gingrich Wins a Smashing Victory in South Carolina. Can Romney Recover?

The regulations, after all, are there precisely because some businesses can make more money by despoiling the environment, endangering public health and safety, and threatening the financial system. A regulation that's not annoying someone by wrecking his money-making scheme would be completely pointless. But there is one category of complaints about regulations that should earn your sympathy: the complaints that too many government regulations are unreadable. Incomprehensible rules undermine, rather than enhance, the goal of preventing misconduct. They create unique burdens on smaller organizations or new entrants into a line of work. Hard-to-understand rules are a lawyer's best friend, and the need for companies to lawyer up is a huge advantage to large or established entities. Consider, for example, the relevant federal rules about renovating an old building suspected of containing lead paint. I hesitate to even quote examples of confusing regulatory language lest my column itself become unreadable, but surely the U.S. government can do better than: ""On or after July 6, 2010, all renovations must be performed in accordance with the work practice standards in SS745.85 and the associated recordkeeping requirements in SS745.86(b)(1) and (b)(6) in target housing or child-occupied facilities, unless the renovation qualifies for the exception identified in SS745.82(a)."" You'll be glad to know, however, that SS745.82(a) does, among other things, offer an exemption for ""emergency renovations"" (which has a word salad definition of its own)--with the sub-exception that ""emergency renovations are not exempt from the cleaning requirements of SS745.85(a)(5), which must be performed by certified renovators or individuals trained in accordance with SS745.90(b)(2), the cleaning verification requirements of SS745.85(b), which must be performed by certified renovators, and the recordkeeping requirements of SS745.86(b)(6) and (b)(7)."" Got it? Me neither. Into this stew dives Iowa Democrat Rep. Bruce Braley, who unveiled his Plain Regulations Act on Wednesday, saying, ""Gobbledygook dominates the regulations issued by government agencies, making it almost impossible for small businesses to understand the rules of the road."" Forcing the government to write in plain English is a great idea. So good, in fact, that it's enough to make you wonder why it hasn't happened already. The answer turns out to be that it has. Many times. Braley himself authored the Plain Writing Act of 2010, which passed in the fall of that year and was signed into law by President Obama. The act requires the federal government to present newly written forms and other documents in a ""clear, concise, well-organized"" manner. This, too, was a good idea, and has produced some genuine progress: Check out the before and after versions of this Medicare fraud letter. At the same time, clarity is perhaps in the eye of the beholder. I'm not sure I would consider this new NOAA draft statement of priorities to be model English, despite having been written in the post-Plain Writing Act era. Braley's new bill proposes extending the plain-English requirement to new regulations. Legal demands for clearer writing date back at least to the 1970s, when Jimmy Carter issued executive orders requiring regulations to be ""cost-effective and easy-to-understand by those who were required to comply with them."" The Reagan administration decided to rescind those orders, but they made a comeback in the Clinton years. Executive Order 12866 demands that regulations be ""simple and easy to understand, with the goal of minimizing uncertainty and litigation,"" and Executive Order 12988 contains eight separate references to ""clear language."" Vice President Al Gore presented regular No Gobbledygook Awards as part of his reinventing-government initiative. And yet after all these executive borders, we still need Rep. Braley and his bills. Perhaps the beginning of wisdom here would be to admit that writing well is hard. It's even harder when a regulation serves both as an instruction for citizens and businesses and as a potential object of litigation. Making text easy to understand and minimizing the possibility of lawsuits are two different jobs. ""Legalese"" is a term of disparagement, but lawyers write that way for a reason. And it's not as if government is the only place where bad writing afflicts us. We've all been baffled by instruction manuals, annoyed by consultant jargon, and confused by health insurance forms. Some of us are full-time professional writers and still wrestle with the question of how to explain complicated subjects in a way that's accessible, informative, and accurate. If getting the job done were as simple as editors handing out a memo ordering everyone to write better, the media would be a very different place. What's really needed is more resources and more support. The PlainLanguage.gov website maintained by an informal group of federal employees who call themselves the Plain Language Action and Information Network, is a useful tool, but it's a bit threadbare. The government could use an active and feisty core of dedicated writers, editors, and graphic designers to punch up key documents. The EPA lead rule, for example, probably needs to stay wordy and unreadable for legal purposes but could be easily punched up by a flowchart that would help you figure out which category you belong in. The Internet should be a godsend for clarity, enabling agencies to bury wordy definitions beneath links or helping you find the relevant rule by asking questions the way TurboTax does. But to do that stuff, someone would have to roll up her sleeves and do the work. That would require some money and some new personnel, which are in short supply. Also, that hard and boring work lacks the populist common sense appeal of simply mandating clearer writing and making fun of gobbledygook."

And Rick Santorum said everything better than he has in any other debate. The last Republican debate before Saturday's South Carolina primary--and the first with just four candidates--was perhaps the most lively of the 17 that have come during this campaign. It was a battle on two fronts: Front-runner Romney was attacked by his rivals, and Gingrich and Santorum skirmished repeatedly in order to emerge as the sole alternative to Romney. There were sharp exchanges over health care and temperament, over open marriages and closed borders. The South Carolina primary is 36 hours away, and the debate capped one of the nuttiest campaign days in recent memory. Mitt Romney's lead is slipping, but we don't know by how much. Iowa Republicans declared Santorum the new winner of their caucuses, overturning Romney's eight-vote victory.  Rick Perry quit his campaign (perhaps just to avoid another debate) and endorsed Gingrich. Gingrich, the candidate of the moment, suddenly faced accusations from his ex-wife, who claimed he had advocated for an ""open marriage,"" when he was having an affair with the woman who sat in the debate audience as his current wife. Debates never live up to the opening montage networks play before the candidates are introduced. CNN called this one ""The Fight for the South,"" making it sound like the four contenders would go at it with dull knives. But this debate's opening exchange surpassed the hype. CNN moderator John King asked Newt Gingrich if he would like to address his ex-wife's report earlier in the evening on ABC that he had asked for an ""open marriage."" His answer: ""No."" He then went on to denounce CNN and John King at length with barely restrained anger. He denied his ex-wife's charge and offered only brass-knuckle contrition. Talking about how everyone in the audience had known personal pain, he concluded: ""To take an ex-wife and make it two days before the primary a significant question for a presidential campaign is as close to despicable as anything I can imagine."" (For a historian, he has a low bar for despicable.) It was Gingrich's second debate in which he received a standing ovation. After the first five minutes, it looked like it would once again be Gingrich's night. Republican voters in South Carolina want to beat Barack Obama badly. When they've seen Gingrich advocating for conservative principles, battling with rivals and moderators, they can imagine him taking on the president just as forcefully. Rick Santorum, overshadowed in the first South Carolina debate, wasn't going to let that happen again. He launched into a sustained attack on Romney and Gingrich over their support of the individual mandate. ""Governor Romney tells a very nice story about what his plan is now.  It wasn't his plan when he was in a position to do a plan,"" he said. Ending Obama's health care plan will be a signature fight of the fall campaign and Santorum was the only one of the three who was not compromised on that issue: ""These are two folks who don't present the clear contrast that I do."" Santorum  so flustered Romney that in a response, the front-runner used the perjorative ""Romneycare"" to refer to the health care plan passed when he was governor of Massachusetts, the political equivalent of getting Mister Mxyzptlk to say his name backward. Santorum gave a series of other strong answers advocating for middle-class voters ""paddling alone"" in the economy, and nailed a question on China by pushing for his tax plan, which would zero out corporate taxes for companies that manufacture products in America. Of each candidate's closing remarks his, identifying himself as a conservative who had not compromised, were the strongest. And Santorum and Gingrich slugged it out all night. They traded blows over whether Gingrich was too arrogant to lead. Gingrich said Santorum's accomplishments were too small. Santorum said Gingrich was ""grandiose,"" which made him unpredictable. He portrayed himself as an unflashy Steady Eddie, whereas with Gingrich voters would always have to worry that ""something's going to pop."" Romney joined in, puncturing Gingrich's claims about helping Ronald Reagan. ""I looked at the Reagan diary, you're mentioned once,"" he said, pointing out that the reference was Reagan saying Gingrich had an idea that wasn't a particularly good one. Romney's campaign sent a press release out listing all of Gingrich's grand claims about himself--comparing himself to everyone from William Wallace to Pericles. Gingrich responded grandiosely, listing his accomplishments, from creating a Republican majority in 1994 to passing welfare reform to balancing the budget. ""You're right. I think grandiose thoughts.  This is a grandiose country of big people doing big things.  And we need leadership prepared to take on big projects."" Romney did not have a great night. He clearly decided that he would show a more forceful side than he did in the last debate. He was at his best when he defended the free-market system behind his career at Bain. He said that he found it ""strange"" that the attacks were coming from Republicans, saying he expected them to come from Obama. When Gingrich suggested that Romney had profited because of the laws that Gingrich had passed in Washington, Romney turned it against him--saying that when he was in the private sector he didn't wring his hands wondering how Washington could help him. He ignored one question about Bain and attacked Obama as a crony capitalist. The point was to show that Newt Gingrich wasn't the only one who could take it to Obama in the fall. ""I know we're going to get hit hard from President Obama,"" Romney said, ""But we're going to stuff it down his throat and point out it is capitalism and freedom that makes America strong."" (Ashley Parker of the New York Times dubbed this the foie gras strategy). Romney's weakest moment once again came when talking about his tax returns. Asked if he would follow his father's example of releasing 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president, Romney said ""maybe."" He seemed unprepared for the question. Gingrich said releasing the returns would let voters know if there was anything they should worry about before the general election. If there was nothing to worry about, why not release them?  Santorum amused the audience when he said he could not release his taxes at the moment, saying: ""I do my own taxes. They're on my computer and I'm not home.""  (Oddly, he also chose this moment to go into a sort of Southern accent.) South Carolina Republicans like to boast that they pick presidents. Every GOP nominee since 1980 has won the South Carolina primary. That was what had once led Newt Gingrich to say if Romney won it would pretty much be all over. But after the debate , he said he would continue no matter what the result. Romney may win on Saturday, but it won't be the death-blow many expected. It has been a bruising week for the front-runner. He'll be happy to stand on the winner's platform no matter what the margin, but it looks like he's going to have to keep fighting on."	"S.C.

In the early days of the Obama administration, when the new president had trouble picking anyone to run it, I wrote a series of profiles of America's secretaries of commerce--cabinet officials who, Herbert Hoover aside, have been remarkable only for obscurity, corruption, and irrelevance. So it is perhaps not surprising that last week the president appeared to endorse eliminating the department and nobody noticed. On Jan. 13, as part of its campaign to demonstrate impatience with Congress' level of cooperation in getting the American economy moving, the president proposed a three-plank plan for reorganizing the American government to help small business. Step one is to grant cabinet rank to the Small Business Administration. Step two is the creation of a new website, Business USA, that ""will be a one-stop shop for small businesses and exporters,"" centralizing information currently spread across various different agencies. Step three, by far the most ambitious, is to ask Congress to reinstate the president's authority, which existed from the 1930s until 1984, to streamline the process for eliminating or combining government agencies. He wants that authority to cope with the fact that ""right now there are six departments and agencies focused primarily on business and trade in the federal government"" and that ""six is not better than one."" Obama's speech itself was a bit hazy, but the accompanying fact sheet from the White House press office said the six agencies to be consolidated are the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, the U.S. Trade Representative, The Export-Import Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Small Business Administration, and something they referred to as the ""Department of Commerce's core business and trade functions."" Don't expect the elevation of the SBA chief to cabinet rank to transform the landscape for American business. The United States doesn't have cabinet government, and hasn't for some time. Cabinet meetings are PR exercises, photo ops that have nothing to do with governing. There are almost as many cabinet officials these days as reality TV stars. In addition to the president and the vice president and the heads of the 15 executive departments, the chief of staff, EPA director, OMB director, U.S. Trade Representative, U.N. Ambassador, Council of Economic Advisors Chairman also had ""cabinet rank."" Expanding the list of members from 23 to 24 by including SBA Administrator Karen Mills will make it mildly more difficult to organize a proper cabinet photo op, but otherwise change nothing. Note, for example, that Bill Clinton gave the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (""drug czar"") cabinet rank as a demonstration of his tough on crime credentials. Needless to say, people kept doing drugs. Obama demoted the drug czar, but drugs are still illegal. The bureaucratic reorganization, by contrast, could be a huge deal for Commerce junkies and fans of rationality in general. The basic idea would be to take the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, currently housed in Commerce, and send it over to the Interior Department where it can sit alongside the management of dry land. That's about half Commerce's budget gone. The remaining rump Commerce would be merged with the five smallish free-floating business-promotion agencies Obama named. The Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics might also join the party, becoming a part of the Economics and Statistics Administration that commands the rest of the government's data agencies. This proposal lacks earth-shattering significance, but it is a good idea. It would save some money, eliminate some redundancies, and align agencies' missions in a more logical way. You're not going to balance the budget with this kind of thing, but saving money by reducing duplication of effort is still good. Unfortunately, there's no sign this reorganization is actually going to happen. You can get a sense of how serious the administration is about shepherding the proposal through Congress from the fact that they haven't settled on a name for the new department. The Small Business Administration, flush with its new cabinet status, thinks the new department will be a bigger, better SBA. The U.S. Trade Representative, already with cabinet rank, may bristle at that. The existing Department of Commerce, meanwhile, simply sees this as an increase of its power, as it subsumes previous separate agencies. A very similar proposal from Jitinder Kohli and Jordan Eizenga at the Center for American Progress last March called the hypothetical new agency the Department for Business, Trade, and Technology. Inside the administration, it seems there may be more affection for the buzzier name Department of Competitiveness. Either way, nobody inside or outside the administration genuinely expects the reorganization to occur, either during this Congress or even after the election. The goal, primarily, was to propose a sensible-sounding and economy-linked idea and then count on congressional Republicans to not cooperate, thus giving the president something new to complain about. If you're hoping for real policy change, in other words, you're out of luck. But there will be a new website."	Obama's Smart, Doomed Plan To Reorganize the Department of Commerce

This is a man with no poker face whatsoever. When he was wilting under the pressure of being asked every day why he wouldn't attack Mitt Romney, the sourness followed him around like the rain cloud in a Zoloft ad. But Gingrich had a good debate on Monday night, and he's proud of it. The next day, he speaks to the local Chamber of Commerce, peering right into an audience of legislators and businessmen, knowing which ones stiffed him. He speeds up his typical cadence, turning them into 'em, riffing more than usual. He's the only one of three Republican candidates present--no Romney, as usual--who treats the room like it's his room. ""Your support in the next four days can change history,"" Gingrich says. ""If I win the primary on Saturday, I will be the nominee. I think it's literally that simple. And if I don't win the primary on Saturday, we will probably nominate a moderate and the odds are fairly high he will lose to Obama. You need somebody who's tough, somebody who's articulate, and somebody who in a billion-dollar campaign with Obama can stand in the debate and beat him so badly that you undo all the damage his ads do."" He massages the b in beat. ""There have been 15 debates. I'll let you decide who the only Republican is who you'd want to bet on to beat Obama in November."" After Gingrich leaves the stage, Rick Santorum follows him up, clad in a blue sweater vest and trailed by two sweater-vested staffers. There's Gingrich's problem, and there's Santorum's problem: They have 72 hours to convince Republicans that the other guy is a spoiler, a no-hoper who can only help Romney win the nomination, abetting an eventual GOP loss to the worst head of state since Nero. The deja vu, it burns. Four years ago, John McCain arrived in South Carolina and outmaneuvered two flawed candidates, Mike Huckabee and Fred Thompson. (By this point, Thompson's campaign was far beyond resuscitation, and he was nothing like the jaunty man we see on reverse mortgage commercials.) McCain beat Huckabee 33-30, actually getting fewer votes than in 2000, when he lost the state. His constituencies: people who thought he was the most electable candidate, self-identified independents, immigration and abortion softies. If you're showing up to hear Gingrich or Santorum, you want to prevent this outcome but don't know how. You like both candidates--you probably know much more about Gingrich. You worry that the moderate's going to win. I caught Santorum at a Republican luncheon in Aiken, S.C. (it was his third appearance at this luncheon through the campaign season), and after the Pledge of Allegiance and two readings from Ronald Reagan speeches, I heard one potential voter fret about this out loud. ""I really don't want Romney to win,"" she said. A room of around 250 Republicans burst into applause. Santorum gave a friendly history and math lesson. ""I would say that we've had two elections so far,"" he said. ""Iowa and New Hampshire. Iowa was a first-place tie. I spent, I think, $33,000 on television in Iowa--I'm sort of embarrassed to say that, but it's true--and tied a guy who spent millions. Other people who spent millions, who were supposedly the conservative alternative, ended up far behind me in Iowa."" This wasn't quite true. A pro-Santorum super PAC, the ""Red White and Blue Fund,"" actually spent $700,000 in Iowa. But he was outspent. ""Then we went to New Hampshire, and I had six days to campaign,"" said Santorum. (He spent one of these days on the trail in South Carolina.) ""Gov. Romney lives in New Hampshire. Gov. Huntsman lived in New Hampshire. Speaker Gingrich had the major endorsements up there. Congressman Paul has been running for president since 1938."" He paused for laughter. ""We finished ahead of Perry and ahead of Gingrich, even though they spent millions and I spent nothing. If you're looking at the first two races, I'm 2-0, against the two conservative--I wouldn't even say that, I'd say the two anti-Romney candidates. Because Speaker Gingrich isn't nearly as conservative as I am on major issues."" In an ideal world, they could actually sort this out. In South Carolina, the two candidates have to dismiss one another frantically. Santorum's argument--how quaint!--is about Gingrich's record and ideas. At the Chamber of Commerce forum, Santorum tries to explain why Gingrich's idea of a two-track social security/private retirement-account system wouldn't work--it would bail out anyone who ends up investing in some future WorldCom or Enron or DutchTulips.biz. ""I'm for a Chilean model, I'm for personal accounts, but I'm for not paying by borrowing money from China,"" he says. ""Does the world 'moral hazard' mean anything to anybody? If you had a plan, what would you be investing in? I don't know if there's a racetrack out here, but if there was, that might be one of the places you'd go."" Santorum has a terrible habit of trying to explain complicated policies to people. Gingrich's argument is much sharper: I'm going to beat Obama senseless in the debates, and everybody else should quit. ""From the standpoint of the conservative movement,"" said the candidate at a Tuesday event, ""consolidating into a Gingrich candidacy would in fact virtually guarantee a victory on Saturday."" At a later event, I ran into Rep. Trent Franks of Arizona, who had switched his allegiance from Bachmann to Newt after Bachmann was humiliated in Iowa. ""Rick Santorum's somebody I love very much,"" said Franks. ""But I truly believe that this race will be one between Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Romney, and I think Mr. Santorum ultimately realizes that and I pray God's wisdom and direction for him in that regard. This thing called statesmanship is often about subordinating your own self-interest to the greater cause of humanity."" But the discriminating, subordinating voter doesn't know what to do. At this same Gingrich event, a concrete salesman named Mike Major asked the candidate if Republicans were damaging themselves by running negative. Afterward, he told me that he was trying to decide whether to back Gingrich or Romney--someone he saw as ""electable."" ""I voted for McCain because he was a veteran and he had the best odds of winning,"" said Major. ""His problem was, he tried to be all things to all people."" I pointed out that this was what Gingrich and others claimed about Romney, too. ""Well, that's true!"" he said. ""I agree."" He was still undecided."

Romney is learning, however, that there is no way to keep the inequality conversation between four walls. It's going to occur in quiet rooms, in loud rooms, on debate stages, and, most importantly, in the quiet room known as the voting booth. Campaigning in South Carolina Tuesday, Romney learned just how difficult this issue will be when he tried to take advantage of the new fascination with income inequality to attack rival Newt Gingrich. Gingrich's capital gains tax of 0 percent would be a huge windfall to the wealthy, he argued, whereas his plan would offer a capital gains break only for the middle class. But then Time's Mark Halperin asked Romney about his own personal tax rate. Romney said it was about 15 percent, because he doesn't make much wage income. Suddenly the income inequality issue that Romney had been trying to exploit was being turned against him. The White House spokesman and Democratic National Committee said that Romney was an example of just the kind of taxpayer the president thought should be paying more in times of tight budgets. The primary question of the 2012 campaign appears to be: What is fair? Is the government, through design or stupidity, tilted against some and rewarding others? Is the private enterprise system broken because of corporate greed and stupidity, or is it instead hindered by government? And no matter how you answer those questions, both parties agree that you are getting screwed, and that fairness, which was at the heart of the American Dream, is disappearing. Romney has an uncanny ability to create moments that highlight his wealth. He said part of his income came from ""speakers' fees from time to time, but not very much."" ""Not very much"" to Romney turned out to be nearly $400,000. Romney also made a $10,000 bet with Rick Perry. He joked that he was unemployed. When he talks about his grandchildren he doesn't tell warm stories about throwing spaghetti, he describes how they caused him to change the distribution of his estate. Romney tries to narrow the vast gap between his life and the daily struggle of regular people. It often doesn't work out well. His talk of worrying about pink slips offered an opportunity for Rick Perry to joke that it was Romney's fear of running out of them that really worried him. The political question is whether voters think Romney's wealth makes him more able or less able to turn around the economy in a way that helps them. Political scientist John Sides has run the numbers and suggests a strong correlation between those who think Romney is wealthy and those who think he doesn't care about their lives. We've had rich presidents before--FDR and John F. Kennedy--but their wealth was not seen as an impediment because voters believed those guys were looking out for them. Romney's Republican opponents are in a pickle. They want to make fun of Romney (you can't even spell his name without M-O-N-E-Y!) but they don't want to look like they're playing ""class warfare"" or ""punishing success."" Still, they can't help themselves. Newt Gingrich, whose Tiffany credit line put him on the defensive, joked that he'll name his 15 percent flat tax, ""the Mitt Romney flat tax."" Speaking on Fox and Friends Wednesday morning, Santorum gave Romney a pass on his tax rate but not the speaking fees. ""To make a statement that I made a couple of extra bucks giving speeches when that couple of extra bucks was over $300,000--I mean, that to me says a little bit more about Governor Romney and his connection with the American people than his tax rate."" The defense of Republican candidates who would make something of Moneybags Mitt is that they are not criticizing his right to build houses across the land and pave the driveways in gold, they are merely saying that his wealth is an impediment to understanding the economy. Santorum says Romney will never win over blue-collar voters in Pennsylvania and Ohio the way he'd be able to. ""Maybe he'll get some liberals on Wall Street or Hollywood to vote for him but is he going to get the guys that Reagan got? The guys in Eastern Pennsylvania, or outside of Detroit, or in the factories in Wisconsin. The answer is no. Who is? Maybe the grandson of a coal miner who grew up in a steel town."" Santorum is in sync with the Democratic National Committee. In the general election they will use Romney's wealth to blunt his message on the economy. Romney says his business experience gives him unique insight into the way the economy works. Democrats will argue that he can't possibly understand how regular people live their lives. Romney says President Obama is out of touch with the economy and points to his record. The president's advisers will say Romney is out of touch and point to his tax rate. When I asked several conservative voters in South Carolina about Romney's tax rate, most were unbothered. One man thought Romney should pay more given how rich he is. But the majority thought it was the correct amount. ""But that's the right rate, isn't it?"" asked Nancy Eaton, who had stopped by the Flight Deck restaurant to hear Rick Santorum before attending her twice-monthly bible study. Her friend Katherine Ellstrom then offered a textbook defense of how lower capital gains rates encourages investment, which creates jobs. Perhaps Romney should find Mrs. Ellstrom and send her out as his surrogate. Unfortunately for Romney, she's likely to vote for either Santorum or Gingrich."

Today he endorsed him. ""I believe it is now time for our party to unite around the candidate best equipped to defeat Barack Obama. Despite our differences and the space between us on some issues, I believe that candidate is Governor Mitt Romney."" Nevermind. It's common for trailing candidates to unleash their harshest attacks on their opponent in the last desperate moments of their campaign--and then to immediately turn around and endorse them. This may be ""just politics,"" but you can understand why it's always a way politicians disappoint us: Were you sincere in your denunciations, or are you sincere in your endorsement? But voters--especially conservative voters--shouldn't get too smug about deploring Huntsman's reversal. His about-face--like Tim Pawlenty's before him--is a preview of the reversal that conservatives are going to have to make if they are going to support Romney as the GOP nominee in order to defeat Barack Obama. This is the underlying contradiction at the heart of a campaign in which candidates insist that they are sincere, and voters insist they are looking for sincerity. Despite all the focus on principle, constancy, and truth-telling from politicians, the whole thing concludes with a Big Nevermind and everyone clambering on to the bandwagon. It's not just Republicans who are insincere. The Obama campaign once held a press conference arguing that Hillary Clinton was unfit to be commander in chief because she had embellished a story about landing under gunfire in Bosnia. What was once an irredeemable flaw was forgotten when Obama made her his secretary of state. The likely eventual capitulation of all of Romney's rivals gives the ongoing campaign an air of unreality. Perry, Gingrich, and Santorum are all engaged in a competition to show that they are the most honest and trustworthy. Believe them when they promise to end Obamacare, and believe them when they offer new explanations for why Mitt Romney is unfit for the nomination. Yet they will all very likely be forced to wiggle out of those denunciations if he is the nominee. They know this, but they also know that only Democrats will hold them to account on this. Though they occupied a similar ecological niche--relatively moderate, handsome, rich, Mormon, former governors--Huntsman and Romney were more than just rivals. They didn't seem to like each other. Romney didn't let Huntsman's critiques roll off his back they way he did with other candidates who had a better chance of actually defeating him. In the back-to-back debates before the New Hampshire primary, they had a set of testy exchanges. In a rare unforced error, Romney denigrated Huntsman's service in the Obama administration. Huntsman took umbrage. When Romney didn't back down, Huntsman responded to moderator David Gregory: ""This nation is divided, David, because of attitudes like that."" It was one of Huntsman's biggest applause lines. In subsequent days it got hotter. Huntsman, who once said you didn't ""need to run down someone's reputation"" in a presidential campaign, said that Romney was unelectable and ""likes to fire people."" Huntsman maximized his leverage by getting out now. He was barely registering in the polls in South Carolina. He was never going to improve on his third-place showing in New Hampshire. If he's ever going to run again, this selfless act will help brand him as a reasonable Republican who puts party first. Also, if he dropped out after a dismal South Carolina showing, he'd be just another casualty along with Rick Perry. Romney thanked Huntsman for his support, but he didn't fall all over himself. For all of the accusations about Romney's inauthenticity, he did the least you can do without appearing ungracious. ""I salute Jon Huntsman and his wife Mary Kaye. Jon ran a spirited campaign based on unity not division, and love of country. I appreciate his friendship and support."" That was it. When a politician says he appreciates your friendship in this context, it is as meaningful as him saying he appreciates your fine spelling. Romney didn't appear at a unity rally with Huntsman and didn't call in the cameras so his statement about the endorsement could air on the evening news. Parties require the Big Nevermind in order to unify against the bigger threat--the other party. It is just one of the ways in which compromise is written into the political process. When parties don't have a coming together moment--as with Ted Kennedy's fussy grudge against Jimmy Carter in 1980--it can be distracting and potentially debilitating. If party regulars don't agree to overlook their nominee's faults, they risk overlooking the nominee."	Last Week, Huntsman Was Ripping Romney. Now He's Gushing About Him. Why So Big a Reversal, So Fast?
15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/02/romney_is_not_concerned_about_the_very_poor_.html	"Mitt Romney is now being protected by the Secret Service. Unfortunately for him, they were not in a position to jump in front of his comments Wednesday morning. The day after his Florida triumph, Romney told CNN: ""I'm not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there. If it needs repair, I'll fix it. I'm not concerned about the very rich, they're doing just fine. I'm concerned about the very heart of America, the 90 percent, 95 percent of Americans who right now are struggling."" This statement is striking for many reasons. Most are obvious--it is thoroughly ham-fisted for a politician to ever say he doesn't care about part of the electorate, particularly the ""very poor."" Everyone knows that much. But Romney's gaffe signals something more about the general election to come. As it looks more likely that Obama and Romney will square off, we are faced with a new prospect: The 2012 presidential election may devolve into a battle between two aloof men trading charges about who is more out of touch. Romney's slip has faint echoes of some of Barack Obama's own tone-deaf remarks from the last election. In the 2008 race, when Obama said the economy caused people to ""cling to their guns and religion,"" it was the perfect encapsulation of a stereotype that Republicans had been sketching for months: Obama was smug, detached, and clueless. When the Democratic candidate with the Ivy League pedigree seemed dismissive of two things conservatives cherish, it intensified the feeling. I've heard this played back relentlessly on the GOP campaign trail this election. Romney has now offered his own encapsulating blunder, lightening the load for every Democratic advance man charged with making sure the crowds are raucous and ready. Anyone warming up the crowd for President Obama need only repeat these words and the roars will begin. There must be a German word for Romney's particular gift for stumbling at the moment of political triumph. This isn't the first time the wealthy Romney has freshened the image of himself as disconnected from the plight of those less fortunate than he (which, after all, is most of us). After his resounding win in New Hampshire, Romney said that income inequality was the product of ""envy"" and that the topic should be discussed only in ""quiet rooms."" Polling suggests that voters find President Obama more empathetic with their plight than Mitt Romney. Fifty-five percent of voters see President Obama as doing a decent job connecting with average Americans, including 30 percent who say he does so very well, according to a recent Washington Post poll. Thirty-nine percent of registered voters see former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney as connecting at least ""fairly well"" with the same group, although a slender 7 percent say ""very well."" Mitt Romney has a single job as the Republican frontrunner: to keep the country focused on Barack Obama's dismal record. Comments like this one distract from that purpose in two ways. They put Romney on the defensive. Of course I care about the poor, he now must say. (There are 46 million of them after all, even if they don't vote much.) They also make it much harder for him to paint the president as out of touch when he looks out of touch himself. Predictably, Romney has been hit from the left for his insensitivity and cluelessness. From the right, commentators say his answer doesn't sound very conservative because it seems to accept the permanence of the safety net. Newt Gingrich naturally pounced on Romney's mistake. Citing the remarks in a rally Wednesday, Gingrich said he was ""fed up with politicians dividing Americans."" Still, if you look at the context of Romney's remarks, they are defensible. He has said similar things many times. In a time of limited government resources, he wants to spend precious government dollars on the middle class first, which he thinks is the pressing problem. He may be wrong about the stability of the safety net and his programs might not help the middle class, but those are different questions than whether he is a scrooge. Romney's campaign is in a rush to clean up after the candidate, demanding that he be judged in context. But they don't have much grounds for complaint. Romney's first ad attacking President Obama took remarks he made about the economy wildly out of context. In a speech during the 2008 election, Obama quoted an aide to John McCain saying, ""If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose."" The Romney campaign made it look like the words had come from Obama, not the McCain aide. So Romney's team has no grounds to cry foul now if Democrats run up and down the street saying that Romney doesn't care about poor people. And the Secret Service can't protect him from that, either."

She was one of Newt Gingrich's Hillsborough County co-chairs, assigned to keep a Tampa crowd cheering and cheerful while the candidate made his delayed way over to give a speech. ""We will preserve for our children this, the last best hope of man on Earth, or we will sentence them to take the first step into 1,000 years of darkness!"" It was a perfect quote--a direct line from Ronald Reagan, an allusion to the Third Reich and the Revelation to John. The problem: It didn't apply to Newt Gingrich. Florida Republicans chose Mitt Romney on Tuesday because they're terrified of what would happen if Barack Obama won again, and the only way they saw to stop that was to choose the most ""electable"" candidate. In exit polling, 45 percent of Florida Republicans admitted that they were voting for the candidate with the best chance to beat Obama; only one-third as many said they were voting for a ""true conservative."" Romney won 58 percent of that first group and just 11 percent of the second. Why are Republicans obsessed with electability? They fear a second Barack Obama term the way Hogwarts students fear He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.

He's also rendered a historical verdict: Romney's campaign is the most dishonest he's ever seen. That cluster of deceit makes Romney unqualified to be president, says Gingrich. I asked Romney about these charges on his campaign bus Sunday night. ""We look for qualities in a president. We don't look for whining and excuses,"" he said. ""The wrong side of Newt Gingrich is being revealed, and it's actually quite sad and painful."" Painful to Newt Gingrich. Romney spoke, his hands in his lap, in the practiced more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger tone of a principal speaking about a student he gladly expelled. An adviser explained what was really going on: ""We are not going to let our boot off Gingrich's neck."" It's working. Heading into Tuesday night's vote in Florida, Romney is ahead by double digits in a series of polls. (A Suffolk University poll has him up by 20 points.) Romney is up, and he's got Gingrich pinned down. It's not just that Romney's attacks are working. They are also robbing Gingrich of his voice. As a Gingrich ally explained, the sniping back and forth hurts Gingrich because it keeps him from offering the kind of positive message that helped him win in South Carolina. The wounded speaker is vowing to fight the battle all the way to the convention, questioning Romney's character all the way. If week after week of bitter rhetoric is the pattern for the primary to come, the question will not be whether Gingrich can win--he can't--but how much damage he does to Romney and the party. Newt Gingrich once reportedly said that ""one of the great problems we have in the Republican party is that we don't encourage you to be nasty."" No danger of that anymore. Romney has won back the front-runner slot through a relentless assault on his rival. After South Carolina, the Romney team decided to leave no Gingrich attack unanswered. Privately, they describe Gingrich as a bully who can't take a punch. ""He's never won an exchange that hasn't been with a member of the press who can't fight back,"" said one. Romney used to let his staff and surrogates soften up Gingrich. Now he takes on Gingrich in every stump speech. In Hialeah, Fla., on Sunday, Romney compared Gingrich's excuse-making for his bad debate performances to Obama's excuses for why the economy isn't doing better. Speaking to a heavily Cuban-American crowd in the parking lot outside Casa Marin restaurant, he hit Gingrich hardest on his contract with Freddie Mac and career as a Washington insider: ""You don't change Washington by having some people change seats."" The attacks seem to be working. According to a Miami Herald poll, 52 percent of Florida voters had a negative view of Gingrich's consulting work for Freddie Mac compared with 28 percent who saw it positively. Gingrich's efforts to make Romney's work for Bain a similar liability have not paid off. Three-quarters of Republican voters said they had a positive view of Romney's business background at Bain Capital. Only 13 percent had a negative impression. The Romney counterattack reached its apogee in a synchronized sequence of umbrage-taking Sunday afternoon. In the morning, Gingrich repeated his claims that Romney wasn't telling the truth. Not long after, the Romney campaign issued a press release with comments from Gov. Chris Christie, Gov. Tim Pawlenty, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, and Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen decrying the assault on the candidate's character. It was a flotilla of fainting couches, as seasoned politicians expressed shock that Gingrich was engaging in the familiar tactic of questioning his opponent's veracity. A character attack was answered with a character attack. The message was that Gingrich crossed a line. This was an attack on Gingrich's temperament--an assertion that Gingrich was too much of a hothead to handle the presidency. He is ""casting about and flailing as the pressure in the campaign has gotten higher,"" said Romney. The Romney campaign was trying to get into Gingrich's head, and it appears to have worked. In South Carolina, voters said Gingrich spoke to their conservative heart. Romney advisers say the 22-point switch in polls in the state took place after Gingrich's extended tussle with Juan Williams over racial sensitivity. ""Williams was a stand-in for Barack Obama in people's minds,"" said one Romney adviser. Gingrich didn't repeat that performance during the Florida debates, and all of his other time was spent answering charges from Romney or complaining about them. He was also buried under negative ads, outspent by five to one. All of this effectively rendered him mute. What little space was left, Gingrich botched, driving himself off message by pushing the idea of a lunar base. Gingrich said people would abandon Romney once they learned the truth about his level of dishonesty. Romney said he wasn't running an advertisement that it turned out he was. Romney said he voted for Republicans whenever they were on the ballot but cast a ballot for Paul Tsongas in 1992. He said Romney had lied about money being in a blind trust. He also rattled off various inaccurate claims Romney had made about his own record. Gingrich seemed to believe that Romney would see his support collapse when people learned the facts. It was a quaint notion, surprising from a seasoned politician like Gingrich who has profited by knowing exactly how attacks work. It is a nearly iron-clad rule of politics that bending the truth works. Gingrich does it all the time in his attacks on Barack Obama. Also, charges can't go unanswered. That was a lesson Gingrich was supposed to have learned in Iowa, where his campaign never got off the ground in part because he did not answer Romney's attacks. Gingrich wears a replica of George Washington's battle flag on his lapel, so it's not surprising that he's vowing to extend the nomination fight. Even if Romney wins Florida, Gingrich's team argues, only 10 percent of the delegates will have been apportioned. Gingrich can hang on and rack up votes on Super Tuesday in March, which includes primaries in Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Virginia. But there are significant challenges to this strategy. If Gingrich loses Florida, he loses momentum. Momentum has brought in money. He can rely on big donors to fund his super PAC, but he won't be able to fund the organization that will be required in future states. There are no more debates for a month. Gingrich plummeted in the polls during the debate-free period around the Iowa caucuses. He'll have to find some way to crack into the conversation. The difficulty of that task will encourage him to get even more negative, a strategy that hasn't been effective for him. Romney, by contrast, will have the momentum going into Michigan and Nevada, two states where he has ties and strong organizations. As Romney wins and Gingrich escalates his attacks, calls will come in to wind up the battle for fear of damaging the party. A couple of Republican strategists I've talked to have already pointed to the bickering between the two and argued that the only person it helps is Barack Obama. Independents look at the two men sniping over who is the greater insider and don't see either talking about the issues that matter to them. By the end of the day Monday, the tone and feel of the race seemed to favor Romney. Gingrich, who is chronically tardy, was more than an hour-and-a-half late to his midday event in Tampa. Organizers had scheduled the event in an airplane hangar, clearly hoping to draw far more than the 150 or so who turned out. Gingrich was hitting back hard, calling Romney a ""liberal"" (he's moved on from ""Massachusetts moderate"") and railing about those who wants to stop his candidacy: ""I am real change, and that's why the establishment in both parties is really terrified."" Romney was greeted by thousands at his events and everyone seemed in a good mood. ""Speaker Gingrich, he's not feeling very excited these days,"" he said in Dunedin, Fla., to which the audience collectively said, ""Awwwww."" Romney smiled and said: ""I know, it's sad."""	How Mitt Romney Stole Newt Gingrich's Voice in Florida
18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/01/sheldon_adelson_newt_gingrich_and_the_largest_campaign_donations_in_u_s_history_.html	"Anyone who counts out Newt Gingrich after his lackluster performance in Thursday night's Republican debate is overlooking an important fact: He has the support of perhaps the most lavish individual donor in the history of presidential politics. Rewind to three weeks ago. Gingrich's campaign was sagging after back-to-back fourth-place finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire. Ordinarily, that kind of performance sends donors fleeing and dooms a campaign. But Sheldon Adelson, the nation's eighth-wealthiest person, is no ordinary donor. Against the advice of pretty much everyone, the Las Vegas-based casino tycoon and hawkish Israel backer singlehandedly revived Gingrich's campaign with an astonishing $5 million donation (by far the largest of the campaign cycle) to a pro-Gingrich committee. The Winning Our Future super PAC quickly spent a chunk of the cash on television ads bashing Mitt Romney in South Carolina. Gingrich won the state in a landslide. After that, Adelson doubled down. His wife, Miriam Adelson, splashed out another $5 million for the super PAC to spend in Florida, bringing the couple's contributions to $10 million in the space of two weeks. That's more than the Gingrich campaign raised from all of its direct donors combined in the fourth quarter. The Associated Press, not typically given to superlatives, reported that the two gifts ranked ""among the largest known political donations in U.S. history."" Just how large are they? And could they, in fact, be the largest in U.S. history? Depending on how you count them, yes. But it's easy to see why the AP kept its assertion vague. To search for a definitive answer is to plunge into the shadowy, convoluted history of American campaign finance. In sheer dollars, the largest gifts ever came in the 2004 campaign cycle. At a time when Democrats were terrified that George W. Bush's Republicans had figured out how to rig the game in their favor, some of the world's richest liberals placed their diamond-encrusted thumbs on the other scale. That year, financier George Soros gave a combined $23.7 million to federally focused political action committees, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Though that's the most anyone has ever given in a single campaign cycle, others were close behind. Peter Lewis, chairman of Progressive Insurance, also gave more than $23 million to liberal 527 groups that year. Shangri-La Entertainment's Steve Bing and the Sandler family of Golden West Financial topped the $13 million mark. Ironically, that 100-year flood of largesse came just two years after the passage of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform act. Meant to crack down on ""soft money"" gifts to political parties, the bill pushed big donors instead to the 527s, with no limits on how much they could give. But there's a difference between the 527s of 2004 and today's super PACs. Back then, unlimited gifts could only go to committees engaged in ""issue advocacy"" or ""voter mobilization."" The groups were barred from endorsing a particular candidate. Not that they couldn't find ways to influence a particular candidate's chances. Among the most notorious 527s was Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, dedicated to smearing Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry's reputation for valor in the Vietnam War. Few paid attention to the group when it launched. But after Texas financier Bob Perry handed it $4.5 million to spend on TV ads, the whole country took notice. Because of the Swift Boat group's deviously effective strategy, Perry's bucks made a bigger bang than the tens of millions that liberals like Soros gave to more broadly focused Democratic voter-turnout organizations like America Coming Together. If Adelson's Gingrich gifts aren't the largest political contributions in American history, might they be the biggest gifts dedicated to a single candidate's campaign? In nominal dollars, perhaps. When you adjust for inflation, however, the free-spending donors of the pre-Watergate era--a time when individuals could give unlimited amounts directly to candidates' campaigns--might have the edge. On the Democratic side, the biggest spender was philanthropist Stewart Mott, who gave $200,000 to anti-war candidate Eugene McCarthy in 1968 and $400,000 to George McGovern in 1972. Both amounts equate to more than 1 million today. But these sums were dwarfed by those of W. Clement Stone, the insurance magnate and self-help author who propelled Richard Nixon's campaigns in 1968 and 1972. His gifts, chronicled in Herbert E. Alexander's books Financing the 1968 Election and Financing the 1972 Election, included a then-enormous sum of $500,000 in the 1968 Republican primaries, a payout that helped Nixon defeat Mitt Romney's father, George. In 1972, Stone's contributions to Nixon in the primary and general elections totaled an estimated $2.1 million--upward of $11 million in today's dollars. Still, Stone's money was arguably less influential than Adelson's. While some of his 1972 gifts came in the primaries, more came in the general election, where it formed a smaller slice of Nixon's total pie. Even so, the donations were outrageous enough at the time that they sparked the country's first major overhaul of campaign finance two years later. Since 1974, direct gifts to candidate's campaigns have been strictly capped, forcing those who want to buy influence to do it indirectly. For those who think modern campaign finance is shady, consider the climate just before the turn of the century. Perhaps more than any other president, William McKinley was seen as a puppet of big business interests--and justifiably so. Campaign finance expert Anthony Corrado, a professor of government at Colby College, reckons that McKinley spent at least $3 million in each of his successful presidential runs, in 1896 and 1900. With the help of the legendary Republican Party organizer Mark Hanna, McKinley's campaign collected money from the barons who ran the banks, railroads, oil companies, and trusts, with each asked to fork over cash in proportion to his company's ""stake in the general prosperity of the country."" Among the deepest-pocketed donors of the time was E.H. Harriman, a railroad owner whose name will be familiar to anyone who's seen Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Another big McKinley spender was Henry Clay Frick, the steel man and namesake of one of New York's famous art museums. Just how much did they give? No one knows, because there were no disclosure requirements. As with the pre-Watergate boom years, these fin de siecle excesses gave rise to reforms. In 1907, Teddy Roosevelt signed the Tillman Act, which restricted corporate contributions to campaigns. Decades later, the rise of big union donations to Franklin D. Roosevelt spurred limits on union spending as well. If there is an apt superlative for Adelson's donations to Gingrich, Corrado says, it's this: Never, that we know of, has an individual propped up one candidate's campaign to such an extent. That is, an individual other than the candidate himself--candidates have long been allowed to bankroll their own campaigns, a fact that has favored ultra-rich hopefuls like, well, Mitt Romney. Romney has in fact significantly outspent Gingrich in the current campaign, even counting the Adelson money. Reforms have changed the ways people give, and they have often suppressed the influence of money in campaigns for a time after their passage. But if there's one recurring lesson from the history of campaign finance reform, it's that big money always influences the process one way or another. Bradley Smith, a member of the Federal Election Commission from 2000 to 2005, takes that as an argument against campaign finance reform. Now a law professor at Capital University in Ohio, Smith argued for the plaintiffs in a 2010 federal appeals court case that laid the groundwork for super PACs in the wake of the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision. A First Amendment absolutist, Smith opposes even disclosure rules as invasions of privacy. Senate Republicans seem to agree: They blocked a bill last year that would have required super PACs to name their top donors when advertising on television. (There's now talk of resurrecting it.) The current rules at least make it possible to find out where Newt Gingrich's money is coming from--an improvement on McKinley's day. When he talks tough on Palestine, it's fair to question whether he's espousing his true beliefs or parroting a line from his benefactor. There's no question that Gingrich has been paid for by Sheldon Adelson. It's up to voters to decide whether he's been bought."	Is Sheldon Adelson's Donation to a Pro-Gingrich Super PAC the Largest of All Time?
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/01/jacksonville_fla_debate_romney_pounds_gingrich.html	"Mitt Romney may not drink, but he was loaded when he entered last night's debate in Jacksonville, Fla. He went after Newt Gingrich immediately and relentlessly. He scolded him, rendered him momentarily mute, and took answers about other topics and turned them into attacks on Gingrich on key issues like excessive government spending. Romney didn't just have good answers, he looked like a man in command of himself. His new debate coach Brett O'Donnell should double his fees. There are now five days until the Florida primary, and state polls show that Romney and Gingrich are neck and neck. Newt Gingrich is up 9 points over Romney in the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. Romney's strong performance will give him a little spring in his step and make his supporters feel like they're backing a winner again. Florida has 10 television markets, and if the editors and producers are good to Romney, he'll get about 12 hours of free coverage of the debate. Romney was not flawless, but he showed aptitude over a wide range of subjects, learned new material, and adapted to the challenges he faces. For a candidate that has been called robotic he was nimble. Romney started right away. If a candidate can deliver a strong moment that will run throughout the next day on cable and on local news, he wins the night. You just have to be good once, and preferably early in the evening. Romney had to know that Gingrich's claim that Romney was ""anti-immigrant"" would come up, and it came up early. He took offense and then took a hairbrush to Gingrich's bottom. He said the attack was ""repulsive,"" called on Gingrich to apologize for the ""kind of over-the-top rhetoric that has characterized American politics for too long."" Gingrich, inexplicably continued to defend the sentiment behind the ""anti-immigrant"" ad that he pulled down and that Sen. Marco Rubio had criticized. It gave Romney a chance to look indignant. This provides us with a quirk of political theater: Romney, who is authentically stiff and robotic in his natural state, looked ""authentic"" in what was no doubt a staged moment. Romney also finally gave his best defense yet of his taxes. After Gingrich dared him to explain his Swiss bank account, Romney launched into a riff he'd clearly tried out a few times in front of the mirror. ""I think it's important for people to make sure that we don't castigate individuals who have been successful. Let's put behind us this idea of attacking me because of my money."" He was in Gingrich's face all night. He criticized Gingrich for his ambitious plans to colonize the moon. ""If I had a business executive come to me and say they wanted to spend a few hundred billion dollars to put a colony on the moon, I'd say, 'You're fired.' (Remember just a few weeks ago when Romney couldn't say the word fired? That's OK it was Newt he was firing.) ""At another time he kneed Gingrich for pandering to local politicians, offering a new project in every state he visited. ""This idea of going state to state and promising what people want to hear, promising billions, hundreds of billions of dollars to make people happy, that's what got us into the trouble we're in now. We've got to say no to this kind of spending."" During an exchange over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Gingrich offered a blustery attack on Romney's investments in the two companies. Romney pointed out that Gingrich had identical investments. ""Right,"" was all Gingrich could say, as if being guilty of the charge he had just leveled at Romney were totally natural. The pressure was so relentless that Gingrich, one of the great exaggerators in politics, was accusing Romney of using that tactic. I assume in the Romney debate camp they took it as a compliment. It was not a universally good night for Romney, though. He denied that he was running an ad that his campaign was, in fact, running. In the radio ad, he accuses Gingrich of calling Spanish a ""ghetto language."" When Wolf Blitzer pointed out that Romney had actually said at the end of the ad ""I'm Mitt Romney and I approve this message,"" Romney mumbled. For the audience at home it was probably confusing, but Romney looked like he was weaseling, not owning up to his words. He also sounded like he was ducking when talking about how his investments are in a blind trust he doesn't control. True, perhaps (though some accounts he does see), but it doesn't sound good. When Romney in response to Santorum's passionate critique of his health care plan said, ""It's not worth getting angry about,"" you could hear those conservatives who have doubts about him say ... and that's our problem with you. Newt Gingrich had a floppy night. It wasn't because the audience was prohibited from cheering. They just didn't cheer much for him. He didn't seem to have a game plan. Backed into a corner at one point, he said smugly to Romney, ""I'll give you an opportunity to self-destruct."" It didn't work. He was even the least effective attacker of the media. He had to follow on after Rick Santorum had interrupted the bickering of the front-runners to call for a return to the issues. Gingrich tried to echo him, arguing that it was OK to attack Romney for his tax returns in a TV interview but ""nonsense"" to try to get him to talk about it during the debate--a theory that is itself nonsense. Moderator Wolf Blitzer stood his ground. For a man who has profited from the debates and promises to whup Obama in the debates, to shrink from repeating onstage what he says in interviews was confusing and weak. Rick Santorum had another strong night. If you were judging in a vacuum, you could make the case that he had the best performance. He repeated his claim that he was the best person to debate health care reform with Barack Obama because he had not flirted with the individual mandate. ""Folks, we can't give this issue away in this election. Those are not the clear contrasts we need if we are going to beat Barack Obama."" Santorum's problem is that he doesn't have the money to run ads in the state and his debate performance, while strong, won't be enough to start a brushfire. Ron Paul has been increasingly impish in the last few debates. Tonight he was piercing and funny. He had a quip for everything. What would you do if Fidel Castro called, he was asked. ""I'd talk to him,"" he said, not joining the other Republican candidates in pre-assigning Castro to different kinds of hell. In discussing the possibility of exploring the moon, he suggested sending some politicians there."	Romney Pounds Gingrich in the Final Debate Before the Florida Primary
20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/01/gop_debates_newt_gingrich_is_right_debate_audiences_should_be_able_to_shout_and_boo_and_applaud_.html	"TAMPA, Fla.--On Tuesday, in his post-debate interview with Fox News, Newt Gingrich wanted to talk about nothing more than the debate itself. The most-recent Florida Q-and-A session was the driest and oddest in months. Why was there a question about Terri Schiavo? Why, Newt wondered, did Brian Williams tell the audience not to applaud?

""The media is terrified that the audience is going to side with the candidates against the media,"" said Gingrich. ""We will serve notice on future debates--we're just not going to allow that to happen. That's wrong. The media doesn't control free speech. People ought to be allowed to applaud if they want to.""

For Gingrich, this was a dangerous move: Team Romney's snark and press releases increase in direct proportion to Gingrich's poll numbers. The Romney camp responded to this debate riff by emailing journalists the infamous 1995 New York Daily News front page--the one with a weeping, diaper-clad cartoon Gingrich tantruming because Bill Clinton gave him a cheap seat on Air Force One. Only Newt Gingrich, the whiner, could want more debates, and only he'd want the audience to yell out.

Sorry, but lots of other people want these things. Okay: I want them. There's far too much griping about the number of debates, and this hot new gripe--a loud crowd is distracting!--is so, so wrong.

Imagine no debates. The Republican candidates would have had, to date, 36 or so additional hours when they weren't debating, and some larger amount of time they didn't need to spend prepping or resting. How would they have used that time? They could, like Rick Santorum, have held smallish meet-ups where a few hundred people could ask them questions, usually easy ones. (I've actually heard an earnest voter ask Santorum if he would defend the sanctity of life. Spoiler: He would.) They could, like Ron Paul, hold mega-rallies of supporters and explain the finer points of hard money and Jekyll Island. They could, like Mitt Romney, rent out packaging facilities or hotel ballrooms or fairgrounds and give short speeches accompanied by Kid Rock songs. Who could possibly want that? The ideal campaign moment comes when a candidate answers questions with cameras pointed at him and no possibility of escape. No control over conditions, or setting, or who does the interview: The candidate is trapped. I'm describing a debate. This format has victims. After Rick Perry dropped out of the presidential race, his South Carolina sherpa Katon Dawson ranted to me about his candidate's Death by Podium. ""We were a victim of the drive-by shootings of the mainstream and liberal media,"" he said, ""and we let them dictate our primary, and we did it to our peril."" One Republican consultant who liked Perry but didn't work for him argued that the candidate had been above average 98 percent of the time and horrible only 2 percent of the time, and that the media focused on the two percent. Both of them said that future Republican campaigns should only accept debate invitations from the groups and people they want. This isn't a wholly horrible idea. Maybe the 30- or 60-second answer format of the early debates was limiting. Shake up the formats--sure, why not. This wouldn't have saved Perry, whose campaign-ending moment (the ""oops"") came in response to an easy question. (Everyone forgets this, but the actual question was about Mitt Romney: ""Gov. Perry, you play only home games in Texas. Do you give him points for winning on the road?"" Perry took that ball and sprinted into the desert.) But the plenitude of debates shouldn't be a problem for anyone. Nor should the noise. When she joined the dogpile on Gingrich, the Washington Post's Jennifer Rubin minimized the howling crowds of previous debates; they were Gingrich's ""cheering section,"" she said. ""The Presidential Debate Commission rules say no applause or crowd reaction. Newt says he won't show unless his pom-pom gals and guys can have outbursts."" They're not his pom-pom gals. Ron Paul has a crew of traveling pilgrims and shouters--there were around 150 outside Monday's debate--but Gingrich doesn't. He's a Republican who's popular with Republicans. He's won over the crowds at nonshushed debates because he's played to them. This is how every debate works, from high school onward. There's nothing, theoretically, preventing Mitt Romney from getting the same reaction. And should the crowd react? It should; after all, it's tradition. Writing about the Lincoln-Douglas debates, the ones Newt Gingrich so badly wants to re-enact with somebody, Harold Holzer pointed out that audiences treated the events like monster truck shows. There were ""moments when crowds erupted into such an avalanche of noise,"" he wrote, ""that stenographers confessed, right in their transcripts, their inability to follow whole sentences at a time."" Presidential debates have been noisy, too. Not recently, because the Commission on Presidential Debates has decreed that audiences shall not make a racket. But the old League of Women Voters-sponsored debates were loud and proud. The crowd was on for Reagan-Mondale, and it was on when Lloyd Bentsen humiliated Dan Quayle. Those debates reflected what happens, outside of security bubbles, when politicians have to engage with real voters. But the discussion is almost moot. In Jacksonville on Thursday, Gingrich gets one last chance to throttle the moderator and whoop the audience up. There's no new debate until the end of February, in Arizona, which will give us a month with no real interaction between the candidates, and with their arguments carried out by surrogates and TV ads. Complain about the debate glut now, but you're going to miss them when they're gone."	Newt Gingrich Is Right: We Need More Debates. And More Yelling!
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/01/obama_s_state_of_the_union_speech_the_president_attempts_to_trap_republicans_.html	"In the 2011 State of the Union, the president used the phrase ""win the future"" or a variant over and over and over again. A year later, the future is not won, but the slogan has lost. ""Built to last"" was the message for the 2012 State of the Union speech. Despite continued unsteadiness in the economy, the slogan-manufacturing sector is healthy. The new slogan could not rescue this State of the Union from the casket of boredom in which every State of the Union speech rests. It might as well be prescribed in the Constitution that the speech contain a vast list of proposals--all of them high priority--and that these proposals be couched in insincere bipartisanship. In a presidential election year, the speech changes ever so slightly, as the president must make an election pitch while trying not to look too obvious about it. In this sense, Barack Obama's speech was very presidential. The speech set the tone for the fall campaign. The president hopes to launch a debate about fairness: what role the government should play in regulating business and how much each citizen should contribute and expect. But it was not a speech you'd expect at a campaign rally with lot of broadsides and winning lines. That's not possible in a State of the Union address, where the president is constrained by the office and the ceremony. Still, this was less forceful than last year's speech and considerably less frontal than the joint-session speech Obama gave in September, in which he threatened to punish Republicans at the ballot box if they didn't support his jobs plan. The thematic core of the address was the same as it was last year: America is emerging from the recession, but to really thrive, income inequality must be reduced, commerce must be regulated, and the policies of the past that led to the mess must not be embraced anew. He said that ""a shrinking number of people do really well while a growing number of Americans barely get by."" His policies were aimed at creating a government ""where everyone gets a fair shot."" These are the themes for the fall campaign, but this speech wasn't a great fusillade in that battle. It was an obligation and a bit of a trap since he can't unload the full barrage in that setting, and he'd also be wise to wait for an opponent so he can tailor his attacks. In the end, it was a constipated version of his speech in Osawatomie, Kan. in December. He made a pitch for smarter regulations. There will be ""no bailouts, no handouts and no copouts,"" he said, a bit of hot rhetoric to reverse the idea that he is in favor of mindless government intervention. It was a version of Bill Clinton's 1996 pledge that ""the era of big government is over."" Everything in the speech had political undertones. At the very start, he praised the troops returning from Iraq. He held up their selfless sacrifice and teamwork as a model to the nation. Political subtext: I promised to end the wars, and I have. When he mentioned cities that could be reborn, he chose ""Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh,"" all of which are in swing states. (The swing states of our union are strong.) Even the slogan ""built to last"" comes from the auto industry, highlighting his efforts to help save carmakers. The president took swipes at Republicans that were familiar but not particularly tough. For example, he characterized their opposition as an effort to ""return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place."" The central policy proposal for creating jobs is a package of tax incentives to keep companies from moving jobs overseas. He also called on more investment in green technology. One of his invited guests, Bryan Ritterby, was laid off but found a new job at a wind-turbine manufacturer. ""I will not walk away from workers like Bryan."" The president will face a stiff set of attacks for his administration's investment in the failed solar company Solyndra. Here he was trying to put a human face on the underlying policy. Don't think of green-energy investment as picking winners or favoring political backers; think of Bryan instead. The speech contained a dizzying list of requests on everything from immigration reform to an ""all-of-the-above strategy"" for energy that even the president recognized would never pass. It often felt exhausted. The key battleground for the coming inequality will be over tax policy. Obama called on millionaires to pay their share, reiterating his support for the ""Buffett rule,"" which he defined: If you make more than $1 million a year, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes. Debbie Bosanek, one of Warren Buffett's secretaries, sat with the first lady as one of the president's props. Her effective tax rate is higher than her boss. (Given Mitt Romney's recent disclosure that he paid an effective rate of 13.9 percent, it's a surprise the White House didn't invite his secretary.) In a time of total political collapse, this State of the Union speech felt more detached from reality than usual. The president promised to ""work with anyone in this chamber,"" but in this election year the chances for agreement on anything serious are tiny. But the long list of proposals that look like they are earnestly offered serves an important political purpose. Before you bash the GOP for doing nothing, you have to make it look like you've made a good faith effort. That's how he hopes to win in the future."	Obama's Tepid Election-Year State of the Union Attempts To Lay a Trap for Republicans

The consultant had spent his day giving Swedish conservatives a course in local politics. What to tell them about Gingrich? As an expert, he had no idea. As a Democrat, he was blissed out. ""I've been saying all year that they'd be crazy not to nominate Mitt Romney,"" said the consultant. He scanned the hallway, clogged with people wearing NEWT 2012 buttons or vintage Ronald Reagan swag, zigging toward the room where Gingrich would speak after his huge win in the South Carolina primary. ""They're crazy."" Who were these crazy people? They were Gingrich voters, Frankensteins stitched together from the parts of other, extinct conservatives. Some of them used to be Herman Cain backers--look, there's the ""Black Hawk Down"" hero Mike Steele, a Cain supporter who used to lead the Pledge of Allegiance at Cain rallies. Some were Michele Bachmann fans--look, there's 20-year-old Taylor Mason, who jumped right from Bachmann's campaign to Gingrich's and spent three weeks setting up events in the Low Country. Perhaps they were like the Sciolaros, a family from Kansas who trekked across the country for Rick Perry, frowned when he quit, then signed up with Newt. Gingrich voters are not, necessarily, crazy about Gingrich himself. In his victory speech--which did, admittedly, come after 15 minutes of frenzied pushing through fans and cameras--the candidate paused from his recycled stump speech lines to add a new and not especially humble brag. Exit polls had revealed that two in three voters made their decision, in part, based on the televised debates. These voters broke 2-to-1 for Gingrich over Mitt Romney. But to say that Gingrich merely outdebated Romney was profoundly, fundamentally wrong. ""It's not that I'm a good debater,"" Gingrich said. ""It's that I articulate the deepest felt values of the American people.""

This was hilarious, and it was true. Gingrich had gained ground by punishing the media in Monday's and Thursday's debates. Fox News' Juan Williams asked Gingrich if he understood that black voters were insulted when he talked about food stamps; CNN's John King asked if he had anything to say about a new interview with his ex-wife, Marianne. In both cases, Gingrich isolated the questions and made them about the media. He was not a candidate. He was a vessel for patriotic, Republican rage. ""They would like to attack any Republican,"" Gingrich told King. ""They're attacking the governor, they're attacking me. I'm sure they'll presently get around to Senator Santorum and Congressman Paul. I am tired of the elite media protecting Barack Obama by attacking Republicans."" The ""elite media"" isn't running stories about the personal scandals of those other guys, because those scandals don't exist. That wasn't the point: Gingrich was saying that all criticism of Republicans from the media should be suspect. He expanded on that in his victory speech. The hated elites, he warned, ""have been trying for half century to force us to quit being American and become some other kind of system."" He knew it, and on this night in South Carolina, the voters knew it too. Before Gingrich got to the Hilton, I drove from Charleston to Columbia, attempting to find his people. It was easy. The Gingrich voter proudly announced who he'd voted for, saying that he made up his mind in the last week, or after the last debate. (Exit polls backed this up: Voters who decided in ""the last few days"" went 44-22 for Newt over Romney.) After a while, the only differences between their endorsements were the verbs they used to describe what Gingrich would do to Barack Obama in debates. In Charleston, a voter named Jayne Harmon claimed that Gingrich would ""dismantle"" the president. In Monck's Corner, I learned that Gingrich would ""humiliate"" him. 

In Columbia, I was told that Obama would be ""lacerated"" or ""annihilated."" When Gingrich spoke, and repeated his promise to challenge Obama to seven debates, a biker named Vincent Sbraccia hoisted his sign and screamed: ""Wipe the floor with him! Wipe the floor with him!"" A lot of these people considered Gingrich a genius, or at least a first-class intellectual. But before they went for him, they'd thought Herman Cain--who didn't pretend to know much--would eviscerate Obama, too. They saw more ads for Gingrich than they'd ever seen for Cain, but they saw yet more TV ads and pieces of mail for Mitt Romney. But Romney, who recites America the Beautiful in his campaign speeches, didn't convince them that he hated ""the elites."" Gingrich did. He'd outdebate Obama because he didn't accept the notion that Obama was a competent, eloquent president. They didn't accept it, either. How many more times can Gingrich pull this off? South Carolina was an usually good state for him--he never made a speech without mentioning that he was a ""Georgia conservative""--but not uniquely good. In 2010, the Republican base was anti-elite enough to nominate right-wing outsiders for governor of Maine, Illinois, and Florida; for senator in states from Nevada to Delaware to Kentucky; and for House seats from the Arizona-Mexico border to upstate New York. Some of these people actually won elections. Now that the other, more credible outsider Republicans are out, Gingrich is in a position to win more primaries. After all, the ""craziest"" result in the South Carolina exit polls was the finding on ""electability."" Forty-five percent of Republicans said they were choosing the candidate with the best shot of beating Obama. Fifty-one percent of them voted for Gingrich. He agrees with them. He knows what they know about the president. Of course he can win."	"The Elite-Media-Hating Voters Who Put Gingrich Over the Top in South Carolina

Take, for instance, the country that provides by far the largest share of our petroleum imports. Its regime, in thrall to big oil interests, has grown increasingly bellicose, labeling environmental activists ""radicals"" and ""terrorists"" and is considering a crackdown on nonprofits that oppose its policies. It blames political dissent on the influence of ""foreigners,"" while steamrolling domestic opposition to oil projects bankrolled entirely by overseas investors. Meanwhile, its skyrocketing oil exports have sent the value of its currency soaring, enriching energy industry barons but crippling other sectors of its economy. Yes, Canada is becoming a jingoistic petro-state. OK, so our friendly northern neighbor isn't exactly Saudi Arabia or Venezuela. But neither is it the verdant progressive utopia once viewed as a haven by American liberals fed up with George W. Bush. These days Canada has a Dubya of its own. And judging by a flurry of negative press from around the world--the latest: Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other African leaders are taking out newspaper ads accusing Canada of contributing to famine and drought on the continent--it seems anti-Canadianism could be the new anti-Americanism. Stephen Harper, the son of an oil-company accountant, built his political career in Alberta, a province whose right-wing tendencies and booming energy sector make it Canada's equivalent of Texas. Harper took over the Conservative Party in 2004 and became prime minister two years later on a platform that evoked Bush's ""compassionate conservatism."" In 2009, he quelled a Bush-esque Afghan-detainee abuse scandal by sending the parliament home to forestall further investigation. The Canadian economy weathered the financial crisis unusually well, thanks to strong banking regulations and booming oil sales to China, and in May 2011 Harper's party won a majority for the first time. It has celebrated by veering rightward and doubling down on its oil bets. Already in possession of the world's second-largest oil reserves behind Saudi Arabia, Canada under Harper is aiming to more than double its output by 2035. Most of the new crude will come from the tar sands of northern Alberta, which are lousy with oil-rich bitumen. But extracting and refining that bitumen is lousy for the environment. It requires strip and open-pit mining, and the refining process is unusually energy-intensive. Producing one barrel of oil takes two tons of tar sands and several barrels of water. Given that the Alberta tar sands already account for more carbon emissions than 145 entire nations, one would think Canada would have a hard time meeting international environmental standards. One would be right. Under a liberal government, the country was one of the first to sign on to the Kyoto Protocol in 1998. In 2002, even as Bush was gleefully thumbing his nose at the climate treaty, Canada ratified it, promising an ambitious 6 percent reduction from 1990's carbon levels by 2012. Instead, emissions had risen 24 percent as of 2008. And in terms of energy consumption per capita, Canada is fourth in the world, 15 percent higher than the notoriously wasteful United States. No worries. Last month Harper made Canada the first country to formally withdraw from the treaty, leaving it free to pollute as much as it sees fit. That has raised the hackles of environmental groups and other countries. When even China, the world leader in pollution, calls your environmental policies ""regrettable,"" you might be doing something wrong. Far from being chastened by the outcry, the Canadian government has responded by circling the wagons and demonizing its critics. This month, Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver issued an open letter accusing ""environmental and other radical groups"" of delaying major pipeline projects and calling for a ""quicker and more streamlined"" public review process. ""It is an urgent matter of Canada's national interest,"" he explained. Harper has voiced concerns that public hearings will be ""hijacked"" by environmental groups funded by ""foreign money."" Not if Harper's party members in the House of Commons can help it: They're planning a ""review"" of environmental charities that many tar-sands opponents see as a bid to limit their ability to advocate against the oil business. And Harper's administration is boosting spending on military jets and warships while laying off hundreds in the environmental department. Meanwhile, Ezra Levant, a Bill O'Reilly-style TV host on a network that has been dubbed ""Fox News North"" is leading an effort to brand Canada's tar sands as ""ethical oil"" and regularly accuses environmentalists of abetting terrorists in Iran and Saudi Arabia. The jingoism has reached comical proportions in recent months as Levant has fueled a popular backlash against Chiquita--yes, the banana company--after it announced a boycott of tar-sands oil. The American corporation, he asserted, was run by ""anti-Canadian bigots."" He concluded one anti-Chiquita rant by telling the company's vice president, Manuel Rodriguez, ""chinga tu madre."" Even oil-hungry America is looking askance at Canada's tar sands these days. President Obama this week rejected the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have connected the two countries by pumping tons of tar-sands oil straight from Alberta to Texas. Harper, for his part, quickly pivoted to China, again touting Canada's ""national interest."" The pipeline he is now pushing would send the same oil to the ports of British Columbia, crossing aboriginal lands and forests that have historically been preserved. The prime minister has made it clear he won't let those concerns stand in his way, telling the CBC, ""Just because certain people in the United States would like to see Canada be one giant national park for the northern half of North America, I don't think that's part of what our review process is all about."" With less than 4 percent of its GDP tied up in the oil industry, Canada is not dependent on oil to the same extent as Venezuela (12 percent) or Saudi Arabia (45 percent). Still, the Canadians' increasing reliance on crude natural resources has economists on the lookout for symptoms of ""Dutch Disease""--a phenomenon in which a natural resources boom strengthens a country's currency, making its other exports more expensive and less competitive on the world market. Remember when buying stuff in Canada was cheap because of the weak loonie? No more. After hitting a low of 62 cents in 2002, the Canadian dollar is now worth essentially the same as a U.S. dollar. That's great for the federal government's coffers but rough on industries such as manufacturing, which have lost hundreds of thousands of jobs in recent years. While we haven't yet reached the point where Canadians are stitching the Stars and Stripes to their backpacks when they travel abroad, not all Canadians are buying into the rally-round-the-maple-leaf mentality. The loudest ""petro-state"" cries have come from within the country's own borders. The website ""Sorry, World,"" in which a Canadian apologizes to the globe on his country's behalf, also has some 24,000 likes on Facebook. But Americans should think twice before attempting to reclaim the moral high ground from the country up north. Even without Keystone XL, America is by far the largest consumer of Canadian oil. Oh, and about that pipeline: President Obama's rejection of Keystone XL is only as secure as his re-election. GOP front-runner Mitt Romney has called the decision ""shocking,"" and Newt Gingrich called it ""stunningly stupid."" By 2013, the two North American countries could be on the same team again when it comes to oil. If so, it'll be us against the world."	Is Canada Becoming a Jingoistic Petro-State?
24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/01/sopa_and_pipa_are_almost_dead_now_can_we_talk_about_the_law_that_already_exists_.html	"Opposition to the Protect IP Act (""PIPA"") and Stop Online Piracy Act (""SOPA"") reached a fever pitch this week, following a coordinated effort by a number of technology companies and technology-related websites that included a day-long Internet ""blackout"" in protest of the proposed bills. And the opposition seems to have been remarkably successful, with the White House announcing its opposition to the bills and so many senators and representatives--including many former co-sponsors of the bills--withdrawing their support over the last few days that both the Senate and House have shelved consideration of their respective bills. Thank goodness. These bills are terrible policy and they have very serious constitutional infirmities. Among other things (and there are many other things), these two bills empower the attorney general to have entire websites taken down based only on application to a court and an ex parte hearing (meaning a hearing at which the defendant is not present), flagrantly violating the Supreme Court's prior restraint doctrine. They also allow courts to order Internet service providers to stop recognizing sites deemed ""dedicated to infringing activities"" in these ex parte hearings (of which there is no apparent opportunity for review). This remedial approach presents a clear threat to the Internet's architecture and, according to the country's top cybersecurity experts, greatly increases security and privacy risks. These and other problems have been well covered, and I will not belabor them here. Rather than launch into new discussions of the somewhat-less-bad replacements for PIPA and SOPA that will inevitably be introduced, I'm hoping this week's backlash will focus future discussion on the many ways in which intellectual property law is already causing the harms that made SOPA and PIPA so terrifying. Because many of the objectionable features of those two laws are already in use. It's time to talk about that. Even before SOPA and PIPA, the government began claiming authority to seize domain names and make their content disappear without notice or a hearing. Indeed, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has already seized hundreds of domain names without any express statutory authorization, sometimes later commencing actions under civil forfeiture laws, but sometimes simply holding those domain names without filing charges. Many of these domain name seizures, it seems clear, were essentially carried out at the direction of private content owners. Indeed, ICE even announced one set of seizures ""on a Burbank soundstage (Walt Disney Studios) flanked by members of the Motion Picture Association of America."" Supporters of SOPA and PIPA have claimed those bills target only ""foreign rogue sites."" That is largely untrue, since neither bill limits the new private remedies to foreign sites. But to the extent it is true that the effect of these bills would be felt primarily by foreign sites, it is only because the government is already seizing domestic domain names (and, in the government's view, a domestic domain name is any domain name that uses a U.S.-based TLD like .com or .net--even those clearly directed at users in a foreign country). Likewise, even without SOPA or PIPA, private parties have persuaded courts to issue injunctions (again, frequently ex parte) which include orders to non-party registries, registrars, and/or search engines to take precisely the same sorts of technical steps SOPA and PIPA would authorize. (The authority under which a court can order a nonparty to take such steps is a mystery.) It would be one thing if these seizures or the injunctions entered by courts in cases of private enforcement really were limited to the most egregious cases--those involving only ""rogue"" sites ""dedicated to infringing activities."" But they often have not been. In some cases, ICE has seized domain names, held them for many months without any notice to the owner, and then never filed charges. Why not? Because it turns out the domain name owner had, in fact, done nothing wrong. Oops. Even when it's not making mistakes--mistakes, by the way, that can be avoided with a little due process--ICE has acted aggressively toward websites that are far from the core of copyright infringement. For example, ICE has seized domain names on the basis that the websites at the seized domain names linked to other sites that contained infringing material. Courts have generally not considered mere linking sufficient to constitute direct copyright infringement even on the civil side. Under certain circumstances, linking could give rise to contributory infringement. But contributory copyright infringement has never been thought to give rise to criminal liability, and criminal conduct is necessary for the proper use of civil forfeiture statutes. ICE has smuggled in a significant expansion of criminal liability under cover of enforcement against the ""worst of the worst."" The same sort of thing has happened in cases of private enforcement, where courts have ordered search engines or other Internet-related nonparties to block access to a site. Nor is this limited to copyright cases: ICE has seized the domain names of clothing resellers on the grounds that these sites were selling counterfeit products, without any apparent sensitivity to the fact that trademark law actually permits resale of branded goods in most circumstances. Here, too, ICE has worked a significant expansion of the scope of trademark law while pretending only to be enforcing the rules against those easily classified as rogue websites. There are three general points to emphasize here. First, no one should breathe easier when advocates of PIPA and SOPA assure us that these bills target only ""piracy"" or ""sites dedicated to infringing activity,"" because copyright and trademark owners' understandings of those terms go far beyond the core cases they use to attract public support. ""Piracy,"" in their view, isn't just about counterfeit pharmaceuticals sold to unsuspecting consumers. It's also about linking to websites or reselling authorized goods, and it could well include any unauthorized use of their work or the trademark. Second, intellectual property law is already full of draconian measures justified on the grounds that they will be applied in only the most egregious cases. Just to name a couple of examples: Both copyright and trademark infringement can give rise to criminal liability in some circumstances, and copyright law provides for statutory damages of up to $150,000 per infringed work, even in cases lacking any evidence of harm to the copyright owner. These remedies are allegedly carefully bounded so that they apply only in the most egregious cases. But the history of IP enforcement is one of continual boundary pushing by rights holders (and the government acting on their behalf) and continual acquiescence of the courts. Despite an unambiguous statutory requirement that the government prove both that the defendant was using a mark that is substantially indistinguishable from the allegedly counterfeited mark and that the defendant's use be likely to cause confusion, the government argues in counterfeiting cases that a mark is substantially indistinguishable when it causes confusion, effectively collapsing the requirements. Juries award huge statutory damage awards in cases with defendants who downloaded a few songs for personal use. (In one such case, the judge substantially reduced the jury's award--though only after the third trial--reportedly making him the first judge to reduce a damage award in a copyright case.) Given this history, and the recent efforts of ICE and private plaintiffs discussed above, there is absolutely no reason to believe any new remedial measures would be confined to the truly egregious cases on which those measures are sold to the public. Much as the Patriot Act was sold as necessary to protect us from terrorism but has in fact been used primarily in prosecuting drug cases, any new copyright or trademark measure should be expected to apply to new and unexpected cases far outside the core of either system. Third, and finally, anyone who has been concerned about the scope of PIPA and SOPA should not be satisfied with the defeat of those bills, or even with defeat of their inevitably forthcoming cousins. Bad as those bills are, they expressly authorize conduct that is already occurring. Opponents need to turn their attention to existing law and demand that it be scaled back as well. Otherwise their victory this week will have been a pyrrhic one."	Don't Stop at SOPA: What About Existing Law?

Originally, Rick Perry was going to spend the last Wednesday before the South Carolina primary on a barnstorming tour of the ultraconservative Piedmont. He'd talk at a pizza place, then meet with Bob Jones University students, then rap with voters in the too-quaint-to-believe town of Greer, then talk about the ""personhood"" rights of fetuses in Greenville. It was not to be. For once, I remembered to check the freshest version of the candidate's schedule, and saw that he'd moved the Greer tour up and made it his only event before the ""personhood"" one. This allowed me to race up the highway toward the Perry campaign, and to escape the fate of the hacks who camped out at Bob Jones only to learn that the governor wasn't coming. (This should have been a giveaway, too--a presidential candidate going to Bob Jones University and the media barely caring.) When I arrived, Perry was already inside the Acme General Store, in full-on retail campaign mode. Some of his staffers were wearing blue ""PERRY: PRESIDENT"" fleeces; he was wearing one with ""GOVERNOR"" below the campaign logo, and walking in comfortable ostrich-skin shoes. With his right hand he held a plastic cup of coffee. With his left, he pointed out wine bottles to the people with the worst jobs in campaign reporting--""embeds"" assigned to point cameras at candidates whenever they're out in the open and follow them from stop to stop like jilted Justin Bieber stalkers. ""Which one do you like?"" Perry asked one of the embeds. ""I like the pinot noir,"" she said. ""What do you drink?"" ""Um, I don't drink much,"" said Perry. ""But if I were [getting one], it would be this one. The chardonnay."" Another embed, trying to do something with the frozen moment, asked Perry to react to the Obama administration's decision to put off the Keystone XL pipeline. Perry looked dully into the lens. ""Uh, it doesn't surprise me,"" he said. ""But it's, uh, again, the president's focused more on the next election than on the next generation. Getting this country, uh, dependent on, uh, foreign sources of crude, and on countries that are not our friends is, uh, really problematic. So this Canadian oil, uh, there's a possibility we could lose it to China, uh, with that decision. So I hope Americans will really become unhinged with that decision, because it is a really bad decision for our country, for energy independence, and, uh, sends a horrible message at a time that we're headed, uh, to $4 to $5 oil--sorry, $4 to $5 gasoline, uh, to have a neighbor who's willing to sell us crude that is, uh, available."" The embed has done his job; a somewhat coherent piece of breaking news was in the can. The governor moved out of the shop, tousling the curly hair of a young boy, Jameson Welchel, whose mother had brought him in to play with Legos. ""You look like my boy when he was about your age,"" said Perry. He beckoned for his son, Griffin, who in recent weeks had been writing funny, unvarnished tweets about the campaign. ""This is my boy. He had tight""--Perry held up his hands to mime a hairstyle--""like that, and he was cotton-headed."" The governor headed out to his next stop, and Griffin stuck around to talk to Duane Kelly, an investor in the store. I asked him what he thought of the drum-drum-drum of talk radio telling his dad to quit the race. ""Look, we don't pay attention to talking heads,"" said Griffin. ""Our job is to listen to the people, and to listen to the advisers we have around. There's a reason those people are paid to talk and my dad is paid to do what he does."" There was a time when his dad paid more attention. Back on Aug. 13, 2011, he announced his campaign for president at a hotel named for the great Revolutionary War hero Francis Marion--the spot where the blog RedState was holding a conference. He stiffed Iowa (that's how the locals saw it, anyway) while declaring himself the candidate of the right-wing blogerati. Six months later, they were all calling on him to quit. He was getting no traction, and he didn't look like he ever would. ""Boy,"" said Duane Kelly. ""He looks exhausted. That's got to be exhausting."" At that moment, Perry was actually crackling back to life. Around 20 students from Georgia's Mercer University had located the Perry campaign--they were touring the state, learning about politics. Perry spent 10 minutes talking to them on the sidewalk, taking particular interest in a student who'd served in the Marine Corps, and telling him a very long version of a story about one of his endorsers, a Medal of Honor winner, saving another Medal of Honor winner. (Said endorser, Mike Thornton, stood watch a couple of feet away. The medal hung around his neck.) ""What's the best part of campaigning?"" asked one student. ""Getting to see different parts of the country that you never would,"" said Perry, with none of the ""uhs"" that he emitted during the policy question. ""South Carolina's got great cities. These older towns that have great character. I'll tell you this, Georgetown's one of the more intriguing cities--big ol' oak trees over the streets."" Perry slowly worked through town, ending up at the Southern Thymes Cafe, which was ominously far from crowded. The Georgia students got there early and occupied the best seats. They also asked the only two questions that Perry had time for, softballs about ""what else you wanted to say at the debate"" and what he'd do for veterans. ""It's all about the next generation,"" said Perry, ""like these kids from Mercer!"" And then he was gone. His campaign team confirmed that the other events were canceled, but that they were only tentative anyway. The governor enjoyed some downtime. Between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m., he made a decision: He would leave the race. As the day went on, he broke the news to advisers. Still, he kept his ""personhood"" appointment. He took a chair onstage at a Hilton in Greenville and was gently grilled by three moderators who wanted to know how pro-life he really was. When they were done, they offered him 60 seconds for closing remarks. ""Sixty seconds!"" said Perry. ""That sounds like a debate!"" He jokingly slapped his thigh with a sheet of paper. The audience got the joke. The next morning, the embeds and everybody else filed into a North Charleston Hyatt to watch Perry admit defeat. ""I am not done fighting for the cause of conservatism,"" he said, after endorsing Newt Gingrich and thanking his family and chagrined endorsers. ""In fact, I have only begun to fight."" That statement meant so much less than it did six months ago, at the hotel down the highway. Perry had been reduced by the exposure of a presidential campaign. He'd been a proud, libertarian critic of the welfare state. He'd become a guy shambling through retail campaign stops until he, and his donors, couldn't take it anymore. After Perry wrapped and disappeared upstairs, his campaign team gritted its teeth through endless chats with reporters. They revealed the tick-tock of the decision process, and how Perry had come to endorse Gingrich. They assured us that nothing like the 2012 Perry campaign could happen again--that the media will never again grind down good men by tripping them up with endless debates and obsessive coverage. ""The lesson,"" said Perry's South Carolina adviser Katon Dawson, ""is that the candidates are gonna need to have the discipline, and the campaign teams are gonna need to have the discipline, to say yes and no. You watch. The Democrats will. There'll be a panel, there'll be a campaign adviser on each one, and they'll pick the [debate] dates they want, the people they want."" The media had set traps for Perry, he said. ""They were building the fields, and waiting for them to come. That won't happen again. We were a victim of the drive-by shootings of the mainstream and liberal media, and we let them dictate our primary, and we did it to our peril."""	The Final 24 Hours of Rick Perry's Misbegotten Presidential Campaign
26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/01/gingrich_s_south_carolina_comeback_does_newt_s_surge_threaten_romney_.html	"Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich are both trying to help South Carolina voters imagine what will happen if Gingrich captures the nomination. In the Gingrich model, he crushes President Obama in the fall 2012 debates, wins a huge victory on Election Day, and prepares the country for fundamental change. In the Romney vision, the undisciplined Gingrich clatters into the fall surrounded by the wreckage of his campaign: His oddball comments set off a series of press feeding frenzies, and he manages to squander a huge Republican opportunity to regain the White House. Newt Gingrich is closing in on Romney in South Carolina. A Time poll out late Wednesday confirms what is already apparent on the ground. Romney is at 33 percent and Gingrich is at 23 percent, a recent slip of four points for Romney and an increase of five for Gingrich. Former Sen. Rick Santorum, the other contender for the non-Romney vote, trails with 16 percent. Gingrich was the clear winner of Monday's debate, Romney and Santorum have started attacking him (a sure sign he's on the move), and his pitch to voters is solid. (Plus, as Dave Weigel notes, Gingrich's body language screams confidence; if he could have moonwalked off the debate stage Monday night, he might have.) If Gingrich doesn't catch Romney, it might be the last chance for those in the party who want to stop the front-runner. ""Your support in the next four days can change history,"" Gingrich said at a forum sponsored by the state Chamber of Commerce. ""If I win the primary Saturday night, I will be the nominee. I think it's literally that simple. And if I don't win the primary Saturday, we will probably nominate a moderate and odds are fairly high that he will lose to Obama."" Conservative voters generally agree that they want Gingrich, Santorum, and Perry to find a way not to split the anti-Romney vote. Gingrich has been making the hard sell that he is the only credible alternative: ""Any vote for Santorum or Perry, in effect, is a vote to allow Romney to become the nominee, because we've got to bring conservatives together in order to stop him."" Gingrich's closing pitch is founded on his debate performances. He was strong Monday night and he can't stop boasting about it. At a rally in Florence, S.C. Tuesday, he described what it was like watching the crowd in the hall rise to its feet to applaud him. By Wednesday, he was telling crowds it was the first time a candidate had won a standing ovation since Ronald Reagan's famous burst of anger in Nashua, N.H. in 1980. Gingrich's aggressive tone syncs well with Republican enthusiasm for really beating Obama. After Gingrich finished speaking Tuesday, a man asked a question insisting that the Republican nominee had to go after Obama and ""bloody his nose."" Gingrich, who stood before an American flag and a sculpture of a bald eagle with wings outstretched, offered, ""I don't want to bloody his nose, I want to knock him out."" The audience liked that line a great deal. Afterward, Jesse Adams, a retired agriculture extension agent, was gushing about Gingrich and his debate performances. ""He has a fire in the belly,"" he said ""Most of all, what we need is someone who can beat Barack Obama and stop what's going on in Washington."" Supporters waiting for Rick Santorum to arrive at the Flight Deck restaurant in Lexington were also desperate for someone to beat Obama. They really like Santorum, they share his values and want to vote for him, but they're not sure. ""I worry though,"" said Susan Sisk, ""can he go all the way."" Nancy Eaton was there because she's undecided between Gingrich and Santorum. After listing the reasons she likes Santorum I asked her how much stock she puts in Gingrich's claim that he can beat Obama in the debates. You'd think I'd asked her if you needed the sun to grow flowers. ""That's a no brainer."" The desire among Santorum voters for a little bit more might be where Gingrich's new votes are coming from. The Romney camp didn't need the Time poll to know Gingrich was gaining on them. Romney has returned to attacking Gingrich, saying Gingrich's claim that he helped create jobs during the Reagan and Clinton era is like Al Gore taking credit for the Internet. His campaign scheduled a conference call with reporters to undermine Gingrich's leadership credentials. The conference passcode was ""unreliable leader."" Former Sen. Jim Talent and former Rep. Susan Molinari described a reckless, unhinged management style. ""It was leadership by chaos,"" said Molinari. ""If Speaker Gingrich is the nominee he will be the issue, not Barack Obama."" They argued that he had not changed in the years since the speakership and pointed to his erratic moments on the campaign trail as proof of the embedded defect. Santorum is making the same case. ""Newt is great in a think tank,"" he said to the Lexington crowd, ""coming up with a lot of different policy ideas, but as far as leadership ... three years into his speakership there was a conservative revolution against Newt trying to throw him out because he wasn't following conservative principles."" There is one more debate before the South Carolina vote on Saturday. Given Newt Gingrich's penchant for hyperbole and his regard for his debate performances, he may very well declare it the most significant event in history since the Big Bang. It may well determine whether his campaign continues with one or ends with a whimper."	Gingrich Makes Another Comeback: Does His Surge Threaten Romney?

He did so citing his constitutional authority to unilaterally fill vacancies during a Senate recess. Later that same day, the president claimed the same prerogative to appoint three new members to the National Labor Relations Board. Outraged Republicans argue that the Senate was not in recess because a few senators held brief, pro forma sessions over the holidays to block these very appointments. The President's lawyers contend that the Senate was effectively in recess because there was no possibility it could convene as a body to confirm the president's appointees during that period. The dispute has just been brought before a federal district court in Washington, D.C., and is sure to be followed by a cascade of lawsuits challenging actions taken by Cordray and the newly-constituted National Labor Relations Board. The Department of Justice will ably defend President Obama's recess appointments in this case. Unfortunately, the litigation will almost certainly proceed without the participation of the institution with the most at stake in this fight: the Senate. And that is because Congress almost never defends its interests in court, even when the President's lawyers seek to expand executive authority at Congress's expense. No one would deny the Senate's right to join in lawsuits about the meaning of the Constitution's Recess Appointments Clause. Like the House of Representatives, the Senate employs legal counsel whose job it is to defend Senate prerogatives in court, and both chambers of Congress have occasionally participated in litigation challenging the constitutionality of federal laws. For example, the House of Representatives is currently defending the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act in federal court after the Obama Administration declined to do so. Likewise, in 1988 for instance, both chambers participated in litigation over the constitutionality of independent counsels, and the Senate defended the Line Item Veto Act when that statute came before the Supreme Court. But these are the unusual cases. Typically, the House and Senate do not show up in court to defend their interests. So, for example, when President George W. Bush used his recess appointment power to place Judge William Pryor on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals during a 10-day ""intrasession recess,"" rather than a recess between Senate sessions, the Senate did not participate in the subsequent litigation over the constitutionality of that appointment. In its opinion ultimately siding with the Bush administration, the court of appeals expressly noted that the Senate had not joined in the challenge to Judge Pryor's recess appointment--a fact that appears to have influenced the court's decision to accord Judge Pryor's appointment a ""presumption"" of constitutionality. In other words, by failing to show up to defend its own interests, the Senate freed the court to put a thumb on the scale in favor of the president's view that the Constitution permits intrasession recess appointments. Unlike Congress, presidents of both parties actively promote their executive prerogatives in court. The executive branch benefits from the approximately 10,000 attorneys at the Department of Justice who regularly participate in litigation defending the President's actions. Although the Department of Justice generally makes principled and legally sound arguments, it should not be mistaken for an impartial third party. It is headed by presidential appointees, such as Attorney General Eric Holder, who serve at the pleasure of the President, and who understandably promote executive branch interests over those of Congress. These lawyers are some of the best and brightest legal minds in the country, and their carefully vetted legal arguments are highly valued by federal judges. This is particularly true in the U.S. Supreme Court, where the Justice Department participates in more than 75 percent of the cases each term, winning 60 to 70 percent of the time and playing an influential role in the Court's selection of cases. In contrast to the executive's legal juggernaut, the House General Counsel's Office consists of five lawyers; the Senate Legal Counsel only four. The Senate is further hamstrung by a statute requiring a resolution of the full Senate before it can even participate in litigation, which is difficult to obtain in partisan times. Although individual Senators and Representatives do sometimes submit friend-of-the-court briefs in cases that affect their institutions, studies show that these ad hoc efforts are ineffective, perhaps because the judges reading them know they lack the backing of the institutions as a whole. Furthermore, members of Congress tend to prioritize their party's interests over those of their institution, which means that nobody puts the interests of Congress first. Republicans and Democrats should unite to push back against aggressive use of the recess appointment power by presidents of both parties, but thus far each side has chosen to sacrifice the Senate's constitutional prerogative to give its ""advice and consent"" to presidential appointments in favor of partisan in-fighting. So it should come as no surprise that Republican senators who supported the recess appointment of Judge Pryor now criticize President Obama's similar use of that power, while Democratic Senators take precisely the opposite positions. The executive has taken full advantage of the resulting institutional paralysis, convincing judges to interpret the U.S. Constitution, and even Congress's own statutes, in ways that invariably benefit the president at the expense of Congress. In fact, the House and Senate are so ill-prepared to litigate in their own interests that they are often forced to turn to private outside counsel to do so for them, which can cause problems of its own. Last spring, after the Obama administration refused to defend the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act, the U.S. House of Representatives hired King & Spalding partner Paul Clement to defend the legislation. A few weeks later King & Spalding withdrew from the case, a decision that was roundly criticized in the press and led Clement to resign from the firm in protest. (Clement has switched law firms and continues to represent the House.) Whatever motivated King & Spalding to withdraw, the commotion that followed illustrates the obvious: Congress needs effective in-house counsel. After all, the president can rely on the thousands of lawyers at the Department of Justice without fear of conflicts of interest or client boycotts, and without racking up hundreds of thousands of dollars in lawyers' fees. (Indeed Clement himself ably served as President George W. Bush's Solicitor General, earning his stellar professional reputation and fighting to protect executive branch interests, at a reasonable government salary. Neither the House nor the Senate should be left scrambling for the same, very costly, representation while the President benefits from the best lawyers taxpayer money can buy. The last 50 years have seen a vast expansion of presidential power that has been a result in part, of judicial decisions that interpret the Constitution and federal statutes in ways that favor the executive. For example, courts now regularly defer to executive branch interpretations of statutes, especially in the area of national security and foreign policy, which makes it harder for Congress to play its constitutional role in shaping policy. In an adversarial legal system such as our own, we should not be surprised that Congress has pretty consistently lost these legal battles, considering that it hardly ever shows up to argue its case in court. The solution is in Congress's hands. Both the House and Senate could expand their legal staffs to at least a dozen lawyers, and then empower those lawyers to protect Congress's institutional interests in litigation--starting with the Senate's constitutional authority to give its ""advice and consent"" to the president's nominees for high office. Most important, Congress could take a page out of the executive's playbook by thinking about protecting its own long-term institutional interests instead of fretting over the short-term effect on the political party in power."	Why Congress Needs Effective In-House Counsel To Protect Its Own Interests in Court

Mitt Romney should hope not. At Monday night's debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C., Newt Gingrich won in both the compulsory and freestyle categories: He offered complete answers that will look great to Republicans on YouTube (his exchange with Juan Williams), quips at his opponent's expense (his dig at Romney's super PAC), memorable lines (Andrew Jackson's view on killing enemies), and substance (he had the details, not merely generalities). If conservatives feel they must rally around a single alternative to Romney who can forcefully take on Obama and argue unapologetically for conservative principles, Gingrich presented the best possible case at the right moment. Gingrich has said that if Romney wins South Carolina, the race is over. Each day some new Republican voice echoes that sentiment. In national polls, Romney is running more than 20 points ahead of the pack. Gingrich's strongest moment was his nearly five-minute exchange with Fox's Juan Williams, who asked Gingrich about his comments about African-Americans and food stamps and his suggestion that inner-city kids take on janitorial duties at school to develop good work habits. Didn't he see how that might be offensive, Williams asked. ""No,"" Gingrich responded. It was the biggest applause for a one-word answer at a debate since Joe Biden responded to a question asking if he could curb his verbosity by simply answering ""Yes."" Gingrich went on to defend his theory about the relationship between work and self-esteem, lashing out against liberal elites and concluding with a riff that won him a standing ovation: ""So here's my point,"" he said straight into the camera. ""I believe every American of every background has been endowed by their creator with the right to pursue happiness. And if that makes liberals unhappy, I'm going to continue to find ways to help poor people learn how to get a job, learn how to get a better job and learn some day to own the job."" To give you some sense of how well the Juan Williams exchange went for Gingrich, look at the audience reactions during the back-and-forth as recorded by the Congressional Quarterly transcript: (APPLAUSE); (LAUGHTER); (APPLAUSE); (APPLAUSE);(BOOING [of Williams]);(APPLAUSE); (LAUGHTER);(APPLAUSE); (APPLAUSE); (APPLAUSE); (APPLAUSE); (COMMERCIAL BREAK). It wasn't just that Gingrich was saying things conservatives believe. He was standing up for conservative principles under assault. He was showing conviction and fight, something that voters who worry about Romney have been looking for. Romney did not have his best night. He talks a lot about strength on the stump, particularly when it comes to national security. But he seemed weak onstage compared to Gingrich, Perry, and Santorum. Those candidates have an urgency in their voice when they talk about what they believe in (it's not just that they're urgent because they're behind in the polls). Romney's responses seemed rote for most of the debate. Usually he overcomes his lack of passion with precision and facts, but this time he was wobbly for a few patches, which made him seem vulnerable. But only to a point. Romney's rivals helped themselves but they did not make a sustained, effective case against him. Weakness in one performance isn't going to undermine the pitch that has been working for him: Voters think he's electable and his experience in the business community gives him special insight into the economy. Romney is also likely to continue to benefit from strong performances from his rivals. When they all do well, it makes it harder to pick a clear Romney alternative. Lots of choices means the vote is split. Campaigning Monday, Gingrich pleaded with conservatives not to do this. ""If you vote for Senator Santorum, in effect you're functionally voting for Governor Romney to be the nominee because he's not going to beat him,"" Gingrich said. ""The only way you can stop Governor Romney for all practical purposes is to vote for Newt Gingrich. That's just a fact. It's a mathematical fact now."" Conservatives who are still looking for a Romney alternative could find something to like in Perry's call to return power to the states, his call to end the ""war"" on the states from federal regulations, and his defense of Marines condemned for urinating on the corpses of Taliban fighters killed in battle. Santorum, who seemed to disappear from the stage at times, had moments of command. He pressed Romney on his record in Massachusetts and Gingrich on his Social Security plan. He wasn't stellar, and not nearly as good as he needed to be to become the front-runner in the non-Romney race, but if you were a Santorum supporter he didn't do anything to make you jump ship. (Only Paul had a bad night; at times, explaining his positions on defense spending and killing Bin Laden, he meandered.) Romney was at his best when he talked about his years working at Bain Capital. At the very start of the debate, Gingrich was on his heels as he defended his series of attacks on Romney's history at the company. When Romney got his chance to rebut he simply stood up for capitalism. It was an open stretch to sing the praises of free enterprise. When Rick Perry knocked him for a steel plant that closed in South Carolina, Romney gave a perfect response about how foreign dumping had changed the market and caused 40 American plants to close. It was because of experiences like that, fighting unfair foreign-trade practices, Romney argued, that he understands how the economy works. One of Romney's weakest moments came when he seemed to be uncharacteristically without a four-point answer to a question. Rick Santorum had pressed him on his views about allowing felons to vote once they have been rehabilitated. Santorum was in command of the moment, and Romney seemed to be playing for time, unsure of what he was going to say. Finally, Romney said he was against letting violent felons vote even after they'd served out their sentences. But Romney's worst moment came when he was pressed on his tax returns. His answer was all waffle. Here's a snippet: ""You know, if [releasing returns in April has] been the tradition, and I'm not opposed to doing that, time will tell. But I anticipate that most likely I am going to get asked to do that around the April time period and I'll keep that open."" Actually, he's being asked about it now. And if he's open to doing it in April, why not release them now? If you watched just the answer it would confirm every stereotype about Romney as a vacillator. The good news for Romney is that people probably don't care about his tax returns. They know he's in the 1 percent. Candidates who go on about it are likely to seem out of touch. In a Republican race that has always been about conviction and heart versus Romney's calibrated competence, this was a big night for Newt. He won not by tearing Romney down but by building himself up. His challenge will be keeping himself in check so that he allows his performance to stand and doesn't veer off into the zany with a remark that requires several days of explaining. All he has to do is make it through two more days. Then Gingrich will be back on stage Thursday with his rivals, two days before the Saturday vote. It might be the last best shot they have at denying Romney the nomination."	Newt Gingrich Won Monday's Debate, But Was It Enough?
29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/01/mitt_romney_south_carolina_can_romney_s_opponents_capitalize_on_his_weakness_with_blue_collar_voters_.html	"Right before the polls closed in New Hampshire, I made one last stop, in a downtown Manchester precinct, a place I was expecting to teem with working-class voters. Outside the Ward 5 polling station: eight Ron Paul volunteers holding all-but-trademarked R3VOLUTION signs. That didn't surprise me. The huzzahs from voters did. ""Is this where I go to vote for Ron Paul?"" asked a woman hurrying from her car. A construction worker named Carl (no last name, please) traded places with her, his mullet wagging as he walked. He'd just voted for Paul. Right after 7, precinct leaders invited Paul's people and reporters to watch the votes come in. There were 675 votes cast in Ward 5 the GOP primary. Paul won 233 of them, beating Mitt Romney decisively. What did it mean? Well, on the drive to Manchester, I'd heard radio talker Howie Carr lay into a shocked, humbled Newt Gingrich over the pro-Newt super PAC that was attacking Mitt Romney's business record. ""You sound more like somebody from Occupy Wall Street,"" sneered Carr. ""I also sound like somebody from the Tea Party movement,"" said Gingrich. And later, at Paul's victory party, you could make out the noise of TV pundits explaining that Romney had out-smarted the Tea Party, and that he would do it again in South Carolina. One data point floated out of the muck: Romney was cleaning up with voters who made more than $100,000 per year. Only left-wing commentators focused on that. Romney's New Hampshire win was predicted by polls ever since he got into the race. The bigger developments from Tuesday were Paul's continued strong showings and the new, confusing attacks on Bain. Both of them will test what a Republican Party newly swelled with disaffected, white, working-class voters will put up with in a nominee. It's a new problem. In 2008, when Mitt Romney lost the nomination to John McCain, poorer voters went for the winner. In New Hampshire, the 25 percent of New Hampshire primary voters who made less than $50,000 went for McCain over Romney by 13 points, much better than McCain's overall margin of 5 points. This year, 26 percent of New Hampshire voters fit in the ""less than $50,000"" bracket. They split evenly, 31-31, between Romney and Ron Paul, while Romney was winning the election by 16 points. Among the one in nine voters who made less than $30,000, Paul actually defeated Romney, 35-31. In New Hampshire, Paul was able to align the angry blue-collar voters who went for Pat Buchanan in the 1990s with liberals who wanted to cast anti-war (that includes the war in Afghanistan and the war on drugs) votes. The late libertarian economist Murray Rothbard, an old Paul ally, had dreamed about this for decades. But Paul can't win the entire working-class electorate, and this vote won't decide the GOP's nominee, anyway. In 2008, the under-$50,000 vote in South Carolina was only a little larger than it was in New Hampshire: 28 percent. But the two biggest vote-getters in the first southern primary, John McCain and Mike Huckabee, won most of the working-class vote. Mitt Romney, who only got 15 percent overall, pulled 11 percent of the under-$50,000ers. And that's the context for Winning the Future PAC's anti-Bain campaign, given some on-again off-again amplification by Gingrich. Most conservative talkers are united in attacking Gingrich--criticizing Bain Capital as a ""vulture fund"" is anti-capitalism! The Washington Post and Huffington Post quickly located ""a Republican donor"" and ""a Republican source,"" both ""close to"" Gingrich donor Sheldon Adelson, pronouncing the Bain attacks embarrassing and un-Republican. Americans for Prosperity, the best-funded of the Tea Party groups thanks to wealthy donors like David Koch and Art Pope, condemned Gingrich's ""anti-free market, class envy politics."" But we need some proof that actual Republican voters are blanching at this more than they'd blanch at Bain Capital's investment moves. So far, we don't have that proof. On Jan. 10, as he was winning the Granite State, South Carolina polling had Romney ahead Gingrich, his nearest rival, 29.3 percent to 20 percent. On Friday, Romney's lead had slipped, 26.7 percent to 22 percent over Gingrich. The damage came from Public Policy Polling and Rasmussen Reports, two robo-pollsters that found Gingrich bouncing since his Iowa nadir. If there is some anti-""vulture capitalism"" boomlet, Gingrich may not get to ride it. Sure, Romney made some of his money by taking over failing businesses, leveraging them, and extracting cash. Gingrich made his post-speakership money as a ""historian."" For some reason, Gingrich has talked down the money he made from consulting by bragging about the $60,000 he could make for speeches. Give Republicans a primary between Hank Rearden and Wesley Mouch, and you know whom the punditocracy and talk radio is going to endorse. Romney's lucky: The three candidates vying for working-class Republican voters--Gingrich, Paul, and Santorum--seem like they'll divide it up rather than ride it to primary victories. Santorum has worked the hardest to win over blue-collar votes. When he's attacked for earmarks, he defends them. When Gingrich makes fun of ""Occupy"" protesters, Santorum warns that economic inequality is real. Santorum might be better-positioned than anyone else to take advantage of Romney's working class weakness. But in the end, Romney's better-positioned to watch the three of them fight for that vote, then lose."	Will Blue-Collar GOP Voters Ever Like Mitt Romney?
