If you paid no attention to his campaign except to absorb this fact, the Romney team would probably be OK with that. The one thing Romney wants you to know is that he means business. Naturally, then, he announced his campaign Thursday at the head of a vast blond wood conference table, in a gray suit with two Mont Blanc pens. No: He appeared in shirtsleeves with no tie at a chili cookout. On a farm. This disconnect is a problem, argues Republican strategist Mark McKinnon, who says the no-tie approach exacerbates questions about Romney's authenticity. (Don't mingle with plows when your true love is PowerPoint.) But that's not quite right, either. For a candidate trying to remind voters of his CEO past, the 1990s-era ""casual Friday"" uniform may actually qualify as authentic. Romney has nearly 25 years of business experience. In 1984, he was one of the founders of Bain Capital, where he helped to turn around companies. In 2002, he helped to turn around the debt-ridden Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. In 2011, his presidential-campaign pitch is that he'll be able to do the same for the economy. It's a potent pitch. The economy is weak. The unemployment rate in May rose to 9.1 percent. President Obama faces the worst job picture since World War II, and voters give Obama the lowest marks of his presidency on the issue of the economy. It's also the No. 1 issue voters care about. Romney enjoys talking about business, so he looks as comfortable as he is constitutionally capable. Voters may also see business competence as a proxy for competence in other areas. The message could be so good Republicans might choose not to indulge their unhappiness about Romneycare or his occasional position shifting. Still, the issue has its complications for Romney. He faces at least three hurdles: his tepid job-creation record as governor, the job losses created by his business decisions, and whether he has the political will to enact the tough policies in politics that he did in business. In his speech, Romney boasted that he put his business practices to work during his tenure as governor of Massachusetts. The unemployment rate did drop a point during Romney's tenure (from 5.6 percent to 4.6 percent), but the economy was growing and the rest of the country did even better. (During Romney's tenure, the state was ranked 47th out of 50 in job creation.) In Romney's last campaign his aides argued that the smaller relative growth resulted from a uniquely soft job market in Massachusetts and a Democratic-controlled legislature. Had it not been for Romney, they argued, the state would have been a mess. This what-might-have-been argument is very close to the one President Obama makes about the improvement in the current economy given what he inherited. During Romney's Senate campaign against Ted Kennedy in 1994, Kennedy ran a series of powerful ads attacking Romney that featured people who had lost their jobs at companies that had been restructured by Bain. ""Basically, he cut our throats,"" says one laid-off worker. Expect ads like this to return. In the last campaign, Romney made a reasonable defense of the job losses that resulted from decisions and acquisitions made by Bain Capital. ""Sometimes the medicine is a little bitter but it is necessary to save the life of the patient,"" he told the New York Times in 2007. ""My job was to try and make the enterprise successful, and in my view the best security a family can have is that the business they work for is strong."" This is one of those hard-nosed realities business executives are always claiming they recognize. And presumably one of the strengths Romney's campaign is hoping to sell to voters is his clear-eyed, realistic decision-making. The problem is that politicians can't say aloud what businessmen acknowledge in private. Certain kinds of jobs are going to disappear. Hard choices are going to be required. Economic hardship, even if short-term, is going to result. Romney the businessman knows this, but Romney the candidate has to show empathy. He has to promise the moon--just as he would if he were elected president, just as Obama does now. In a recent town hall with voters, Obama edged up to telling a women whose job is never going to come back that it would in fact reappear. During the Michigan primary in 2008, Romney lapsed into Obama-like happy talk. John McCain told workers in the hard-hit state that some of their jobs weren't coming back. Romney took the remark and walloped him over the head with it, saying he would ""protect every job."" There's rarely a political upside to saying bracing truths from the campaign trail (just ask Tim Pawlenty, who pledged to tell them in his announcement speech last month). And the political incentive to traffic in optimistic platitudes, if not outright misdirection, does not diminish once you are elected. The question then becomes not whether Mitt Romney can transfer the lessons of the business world into the public arena, but whether any politician can. Become a fan of  John Dickerson  on Facebook."

This weekend, Sarah Palin is launching her ""One Nation"" bus tour, visiting historical sites across the country. Palin will start on Memorial Day at the Rolling Thunder weekend motorcycle rally that starts at the Pentagon. Where it will end has yet to be announced. But given Palin's other recent move--the announcement of a feature-length film on her tenure as governor--it looks as if her ultimate destination may be the White House. Whatever Mitt Romney had on his plate for Memorial Day, he'd better make room. If we assume--for the purposes of page views--that Palin is getting into the race, the Republican contest immediately becomes one between Palin and Romney, with other candidates circling for a way to break into the conversation. A recent Gallup poll shows Romney (17 percent) and Palin (15 percent) essentially in a tie among Republican voters. The third-place candidate, Ron Paul, has only 10 percent support. The polls are not terribly meaningful at this point, of course. Name recognition has a lot to do with these numbers, so it's not surprising Palin and Romney are at the top. What may be more meaningful in assessing the Romney vs. Palin matchup is the polling about the characteristics of the two candidates' supporters. Romney comes out ahead. Palin has more intense followers, but she also has more intense detractors, and for the last few months her momentum has been going in the wrong direction in her party. In late April, Gallup asked Republican voters which candidate they would definitely not vote for. Palin was chosen by 37 percent. Only 26 percent said that about Romney. Among all voters, the gap is even more vast. Some 65 percent of registered voters say they would not vote for Palin; only 45 percent say they would never vote for Romney. (Obama's number is 46.) In recent months Palin's unfavorable ratings among Republicans have gone up. In a recent Washington Post poll, 37 percent viewed her unfavorably. That was up from 24 percent last October. Romney, on the other hand, has been going in the other direction. In January 2008, in the heat of the primary fight, 36 percent viewed him unfavorably. Only 21 percent view him unfavorably now in the same Post poll of Republicans. A recent Associated Press poll mirrored those findings for Romney. Palin also has hurdles on the question of fitness for office. Some 67 percent of the country does not think she is qualified to be president, according to a Washington Post poll from last year. Seventy percent of independent voters hold that view. Even among Republicans, 46 percent hold that view. Those findings are consistent with a Gallup poll from a year ago. In that poll, Romney was considered unqualified by 39 percent of respondents. If the Palin vs. Romney contest takes place (and TV producers have their fingers crossed, candles lit, and talismans on), it will take place along the existing fault lines in the Republican Party: between the managers and the populists, as the National Journal's Ron Brownstein put it. The Gallup poll shows that Romney captures the support of college-educated voters, whereas Palin does better with those who have not graduated. In another poll, Romney does well with those who make more than $90,000, whereas Palin has more support among those who make less than $24,000. Romney does twice as well among older voters as Palin. So what happens? We know what President Obama's strategists would like: a civil war between the Romney's establishment Republicans and Palin's Tea Party populists. They would like it to mirror the 1996 GOP race, in which Steve Forbes drained Bob Dole of resources, weakening him for the general election. The view among Republican strategists involved with various current and past campaigns is that Romney benefits from Palin's entry. Romney's supporters are unlikely to leave him for Palin. Palin not only steals a portion of the anti-Romney vote from candidates like Tim Pawlenty and Jon Huntsman; she also steals available television air time. She makes it harder for second-tier candidates to get noticed. A Palin candidacy also potentially changes the shape of the Iowa caucus, which helps Romney, who is not in a position to do well there. She appeals to the state's large number of evangelical caucus voters. If she wins or does well, Romney can argue that Iowa is following its pattern of selecting quirky, unlikely-to-win-the-nomination candidates like Mike Huckabee and Pat Robertson. There is one scenario, however, in which Palin's entry could cause Romney's numbers to fall. Right now, the dynamic of the race is that there is Romney and an anti-Romney candidate. If it becomes instead Palin and an anti-Palin candidate, Huntsman or Pawlenty might have a moment in the sun. It was once thought that the Republican nominating race would lack excitement. Newt Gingrich did what he could to keep things lively, but now the master has arrived. Whether Palin runs or not, she has arrived at just the moment the race appeared to be taking shape--and she has brought buses, and motorcycles, and a little bit of chaos.

That was the chant in the union hall where Democrat Kathy Hochul declared victory last night, breezing past Republican Jane Corwin in a congressional election that was supposed to be closer. It reminded me of the fundraising e-mail Paul Ryan had sent out 11 days earlier for Corwin's campaign. ""The playbook the Democrats and special interests have been using to attack me is being used right now in New York's 26th District,"" wrote Ryan. ""As the New York Times has pointed out, my budget plan is at the center of the campaign."" The playbook worked. Corwin lost. So: What was the GOP's excuse for losing a seat like this--a seat carefully whittled from the towns between Buffalo and Rochester, made to elect suburban Republicans? They started making it even before voters woke up Tuesday, when the stench of doom started to waft over the Corwin campaign. On Monday, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor dismissed the contest as a ""three-way race,"" which it mostly was. After Hochul declared victory, the Republican National Committee bitterly saluted Corwin for ""facing a Democrat and a Democrat posed as a Tea Party candidate."" The National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee--$425,000 poorer after buying ads for the campaign--reminisced about Corwin's campaign against ""two Democrats."" If the election was a mess, most of the splatter was on the Republican side. It started after Rep. Chris Lee was caught sending e-mails of his disturbingly taut torso to a woman who didn't happen to be his wife. It was up to the state and district's Republican leadership to pick a candidate; their choices included Assemblywoman Jane Corwin, Iraq war hero David Bellavia, and Republican-turned-Democrat-turned Republican Jack Davis. Bellavia had been gunning for the seat for years. Both Corwin and Davis were independently wealthy. Corwin was a more loyal partisan. (You'd have to work hard not to be more loyal than Davis.) So Corwin got the nomination. Davis promptly set up a ""Tea Party"" ballot line and started running again. ""If they'd chosen Bellavia, Davis said he would not run,"" said Michael Caputo, a Republican strategist in New York who managed Carl Paladino's gaffe-a-minute 2010 campaign for governor. (Paladino lost statewide but won the district by 22 points.) ""By opting for Corwin, they chose the three-way."" This was a district that Lee had held easily, and that had only ever had close elections when Davis, running as an anti-trade, anti-immigration populist with a (D) after his name, plowed his money into TV ads. In late April, the New York-based Siena Poll showed Corwin up only 5 points on Hochul as Davis polled at 23 percent. The solution was obvious: Bring down Davis. And so the Corwin campaign and outside conservative groups started to beat up Davis or Davis and Hochul. American Crossroads spent $700,000 on ads like that. The ads worked. Davis ended the election with only 8 percent of the vote. But the smart take, when the ads began, was that driving Davis down would lift Corwin up. It didn't happen. Disaffected Davis voters split for Hochul. According to the final Siena poll, which predicted that Davis would do slightly better than he did, he was the candidate of 10 percent of Democrats, 13 percent of Republicans, and 16 percent of independents. So how did Corwin lose? Go back to that playbook Ryan was warning about. Hochul started with, and stuck to, one simple message: Vote for me, and I'll protect Medicare. After Ryan introduced his budget, she honed in on the part of it that turned Medicare from a guarantee into a ""premium support"" plan for people who are currently 55 or younger Corwin defended the plan. She started to lose ground. She added a twist to the message: Supporting the Ryan plan meant saving Medicare; supporting anything else meant killing it. That was the gist of the ad I saw the most of when I was in the district last week, a warning to voters that when Hochul said everything was ""on the table,"" including entitlement spending, she meant she wanted to cut entitlements. By doing that, Corwin was conceding part of the argument. It wasn't the anti-Ryan plan playbook; it was a bad translation of it. She had very little time to recover. A lot of that time was wasted by an insanely stupid micro-scandal, when her chief of staff confronted Jack Davis outside a veterans' event and came away with 17 seconds of video and the immortal phrase ""You want punched out?"" Corwin never explained why, if Medicare had to be changed into something that covered fewer expenses, voters should trust the Republicans to do it. ""The goal in politics is to unite your friends and divide your enemies,"" said Sal Russo, co-founder of the Tea Party Express (which supported Corwin over Davis). ""The Medicare issue isn't helpful when Republicans are divided and Democrats are united."" There was more to the Democrats' playbook than an attack on Ryan. There was also fantasy. Hochul stayed gritty-yet-generic when she talked about entitlement reform. At no point did she really expand on what it meant to put everything ""on the table."" When she did get specific, it was in a way that took advantage of voters' inability to count. On the trail and in one closing commercial, she said she'd attack the budget deficit by cutting aid to Pakistan. Check the numbers: In 2010, total aid to Pakistan amounted to about $3 billion. Outlays for Medicare were $458.3 billion. Hochul's victory speech was short but limned with promises and equations just like that. ""We can balance our budget the right way,"" she said. ""Not on the backs of our seniors but by closing corporate loopholes for companies that ship jobs overseas, and ending subsidies to Big Oil and, yes, by making the multimillionaires and billionaires pay their fair share. And we can ensure we do not decimate Medicare. We will keep the promises made to our seniors who have spent their lives paying into Medicare, so they can count on health care when they need it most."" The Ryan response is that Hochul's math doesn't add up, and that at some point, people are going to look at the debt, then look at their entitlements, and realize something's got to give."

3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/05/awaiting_the_rapture.html	"The Republican presidential narrative is taking shape, and it's the story of a child's birthday party when the magician doesn't show. The audience is glum. Now it's someone's frantic job to find entertainment from the limited resources at hand and then convince everyone they're having a good time. Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana has decided not to enter his family into the freak show. This proves he may well be a sensible person. It is a paradox of the modern presidential campaign that we both demand our candidates to be likable yet also force them to submit to a process that bleaches all likable qualities out of them in order for them to be successful. Daniels now joins the long list of candidates who have decided not to run, making this GOP contest feel like the Democrats' in 1992. The number of candidates who decided not to run against then popular George H.W. Bush was so big Saturday Night Live ran a parody of a debate in which the candidates who didn't want to run--Bill Bradley, Richard Gephardt, Lloyd Bentsen--boasted more extravagantly than the next why they were utterly unfit to hold office. Phil Hartman, playing Mario Cuomo, declared, ""I have mob ties."" Some Republican wise men, like Ed Gillespie, would like fellow conservatives to turn from their fantasy-league GOP primary games and toward the actual race. ""For all intents and purposes, the field is set,"" he wrote to Politico's Mike Allen. ""The waiting is over. It's possible someone may get in later on, but Republican activists, officials and donors are going to begin picking a horse from the current field, and things are going to accelerate pretty quickly now. We have a field that will produce a nominee capable of beating Obama next November."" One downside to continuing to hope for a late savior to join the race, from a partisan perspective, is that it keeps the media and Republicans focused on the party's internal problems and not the vulnerable incumbent. But if the race is going to be a referendum on President Obama's handling of the economy, doesn't that mean there's still time to dally? The economy is not going to improve so much that a solid Republican will be unable to take advantage of Obama's low approval ratings. Perhaps. But with each passing day it gets more difficult to imagine a just-add-water insta-candidate entering the race. Call it the Law of Diminishing Saviors: The later you wait to enter the race, the more stupendous your arrival must be. First, any dream candidate arriving won't have an easy time of it. Running for president is hard. Your friends, columnists, and donors urge you to run, but when you get into the race, it never turns out the way they said it would. Running for president is also difficult to do flawlessly, especially the first time, which is what would be required. Obama, considered a pretty good candidate, had many ups and downs. Finally, there are whatever doubts, problems, and worries that have so far kept these candidates from announcing. The desperation of their party doesn't erase those problems. The speculation about a new candidate won't end, however. The appetite for a better choice is high. Some 45 percent of Republicans say they are unhappy with the current GOP field, according to a recent Associated Press poll. That's up more than 10 points from two months ago. Daniels' decision will probably make the number of the dreary go up. Tim Pawlenty would like everyone to listen to Gillespie. He's announcing his official candidacy Monday to be the anti-Romney. The group thinking in GOP political circles is that there will be two candidates in the end:  Romney (because he has the money, following, and experience) and anti-Romney (because key evangelical voters are wary about him and conservatives don't like his health care plan; an April Gallup poll showed 26 percent of Republicans would not vote for Romney). *  Pawlenty is not disqualified from being the anti-Romney just because people have not warmed to him yet. Pawlenty may be poised to have a moment like the one Lamar Alexander had in 1996. Republican voters were ambivalent about Bob Dole, and when Alexander beat expectations in Iowa, he became the flavor of the month. (Jon Huntsman may have this opportunity as well, though his campaign is starting later and without the ""maybe he's our savior"" feel.) The problem for Alexander, of course, was that he couldn't build on his moment fast enough to capitalize in New Hampshire and that he didn't have the money to finish strong. The problem for Pawlenty and Romney and the other left-behind candidates is that it now becomes their dreary task to prove that they are really making Republican voters excited. Defeating Obama should excite conservatives enough, but while dislike for the current president is a strong motivator, it's not enough. Obama is not George H.W. Bush: He's a talented campaigner who will have a lot of money. This will cause each of the existing candidates to make claims for audience enthusiasm that will be overblown. Hillary Clinton tried to do this for a while when Obama was drawing crowds 10 times as large as hers. It did not make her campaign look formidable. Once a nominee is chosen, it will be the party's job to prove that everyone is enthusiastic. That job will be harder, argue some Republicans, the longer the ""savior candidate"" story line continues. This ripple leads all the way to the vice presidential pick, and it can cause real havoc. A nominee who is not perceived to excite the base looks for that quality in a vice presidential pick. John McCain picked Sarah Palin to fit that bill. Bob Dole picked Jack Kemp. They were exciting in the way a downed power line can be. Lots of the energy those VP candidates contributed came in the form of chaos. As the 1992 presidential race proved, a lot of things can happen to prove the fearful party wise men wrong. Perhaps the lesson for Republicans is that the first thing to do is to stop waiting for magic to arrive and start looking for it in the candidates already running. Clarification,  May 24, 2011: This article originally cited a Quinnipiac University poll, but the poll was among all voters, not Republican voters, which is a nearly useless measurement in a story about a party nominating fight.

A secretary gets up from her desk to tell him about his guest. Seconds later, a 78-year-old man wearing black slacks and a comfortable-looking short-sleeved white shirt marches to the door to greet me. He shakes my hand. He doesn't let go. He swings around his left arm to grab my bicep and he pulls us both into his office, as if we are old friends from the football team and we're about to watch highlight reels. ""Tell me a little about yourself!"" he says. He's serious. He listens to a truncated version of my autobiography, making occasional editorial comments as he looks for a few things on his desk. There's a dud grenade with a No.1 on the pin, and a joke suggestion for people to ""take a number"" to complain. There's a stack of cards for his business, the I Squared R Element Company Inc. ""It's a weird name, isn't it?"" he says. ""It's Joule's Law for the conversion of electric energy. That's what we do. That's what we do. We make heating elements. No one else can do this."" Next to that, there's a stack of cards for his part-time job of the moment: his campaign as the Tea Party candidate to represent New York's 26th congressional district. There's a sheet of note paper with lines for a possible speech: ""Both major parties will keep on flushing our taxes down the outsource drain!"" There's the script of a new radio ad, the cut-down version--literally, lines cut out and reorganized next to one another, as if William Burroughs had gotten a look at them. And there are stacks of direct mail and door hangers, funded by the $3 million Davis has pledged to move from his bank account into this campaign, all marked with the reminder to ""VOTE May 24."" The campaign to win the 26th has sucked in millions of dollars from outside groups, almost $3 million of Republican candidate Jane Corwin's personal fortune, and resources from national Democrats. They want to prove that Rep. Paul Ryan's budget has so re-toxified the GOP that Republicans can lose even in a conservative district carved out especially for them. And the Democrats' job might be made easier because Davis is running as the Tea Party candidate and running radio ads claiming to be an ""independent conservative."" He's polling in the low 20s. His red, white, and blue signs are scattered all over the western part of the district. Is Davis a spoiler? He shrugs. ""You think I care about the parties?"" says Davis. ""I've left both of the parties. They've left me. Now, here's something you don't hear other people say. The two parties, they're owned by the corporations. You cannot trust them. You cannot."" Time to explain how this started. In 2003, Vice President Dick Cheney scheduled a trip to upstate New York. Davis, who'd always been a Republican, bought a full-page newspaper ad challenging the Bush administration's free trade policy, and showed up at the event. He never got to talk to Cheney. He was pissed. But Davis' congressman, Tom Reynolds, was a Republican, and Davis had no chance of taking his nomination away. So Davis made a deal with Democrats: Let him run on their ballot line, and he'd spend his money to tear the bark off Reynolds. In 2004, a pretty good year for Republicans, Davis cut Reynolds's winning margin from 51 points to 11 points. In 2006, Reynolds was nearly subsumed by the Mark Foley scandal, and he beat Davis by only 4 points--a victory some wags here credit to an early blizzard that let Reynolds take over the airwaves as he brought relief money home. No blizzard, and Davis might have become a member of Congress. That election was tantalizing for Democrats. When Reynolds announced his retirement, they realized they could do without Davis. At last! He was simpatico with them on abortion, and Iraq, and ... basically nothing else. They got a new candidate. But Davis didn't stop running. He tore down the Democrats' new candidate so effectively that a third, weak candidate ending up winning the Democratic primary and then losing to the GOP's Reynolds replacement: a handsome, Craigslist-surfing man named Chris Lee. We know how that turned out. Davis doesn't regret running these campaigns. He just regrets that he ran them as a Democrat. That made it impossible for him to win the GOP's nomination this year, and it spawned ad after ad in which he--a Republican for years!--is portrayed as a Democratic pawn. A new ad paid for by the National Republican Congressional Committee, eschewing subtlety, even portrays Davis and Democratic candidate Kathy Hochul as dancing puppets being jerked around by Nancy Pelosi, who is grinning like a Killer Klown from Outer Space. Davis' own ads take harder aim at Corwin than at Hochul, but that could be explained by strategy or by pique. ""I'd have an easier time now if I'd always filed petitions and run third party,"" he says. ""I'm poison to the Republicans now."" But he never fit within either party. If elected, he says, he'd caucus with the Republican Party, but he doesn't like what the GOP's stood for recently. Davis is running on a promise to try and dismantle the trade deals passed since the 1980s. ""Ross Perot predicted all of this,"" says Davis. ""It's the 'giant sucking sound.' The only thing he got wrong is that the sucking sound is not coming from Mexico. It's China."" Ask Davis about any issue, and he'll bring it back to China. Would he reform entitlements? No. ""If we all had good-paying jobs, there wouldn't have been a recession, we wouldn't lose our homes, we wouldn't lose our health care, and we wouldn't leave this debt for our children."" Would he vote to raise the debt ceiling? ""The concession I'd want in order to vote for that is to get us out of the WTO. That's a big concession, right? Well, we need to do it."" After we talk for a while, Davis takes me into his official campaign office--that would be the office right next to his--to watch a mostly finished copy of a new ad. In it, a man comes home, informs his family that he's lost his job, and sets off a Willie Loman chain of events. ""The company's moving the factory to China.""""How can we pay for my chemotherapy without health insurance?"" ""Will mom be OK?"" ""What do you think of that?"" asks Davis. ""Some of the women in the office saw that, and they cried."" When you spend a little time in the district, the Republican ads claiming Davis is a Democrat look silly. Yes, the Tea Party Express, which was co-founded by Republican strategists, came to the district this week to denounce Davis and endorse Corwin. Two members of Congress who were boosted by the Tea Party, Allen West and Marco Rubio, have cut calls for Corwin. But Davis, in his way, is the embodiment of the Tea Party, a one-man spokesperson for its fear of American decline. He's a pure nationalist who thinks that America got off track at some point, and that the boom days of the 1950s can return if taxes are low and trade deals get shredded. He reads Lou Dobbs and Paul Craig Roberts. He hates politicians. It takes some effort, when asked about his opponents, to judge them as ""adequate,"" because, like everyone in the Tea Party, he thinks if you've been in politics you've contracted the virus that's come close to ruining this country. ""I'm not going to be like any congressman,"" says Davis. ""Not to brag, but I'm not like any man. I started this company in my garage. You're here. You see the size of this establishment. When I die, I'm giving this company to my employees. I'm spending $3 million on this campaign. You name somebody else who has those credentials."" Before we wrap up, Davis puts on a jacket and takes me through a tour of his factory, past furnaces and rows and rows of heat conductors about to be sold and shipped. I ask him why some Chinese company hasn't just figured out how to do this and forced him out of business. ""Well, we're smarter than they are,"" he says. ""They're good at copying but we're more likely to take a chance. Our minds work better at being innovative."" Mark Stonebreaker, a 33-year employee, takes a breather to explain why he's voting for Davis. ""This guy started a business in his garage,"" says Stonebreaker. ""You look at all the regulation we've gotten since then, and all the business China is doing. Could anyone do that if they tried to right now? Could you start a business in your garage?"" ""Yeah,"" interrupts Davis. ""I could do it."""	NY 26: Jack Davis and the Tea Party vs. Jane Corwin and the Republican Party.	['Roberts', 'Allen', 'Paul']	[]

What prompts his suggestion is a case involving Boeing's plan to move some production of its 787 airliners to South Carolina, a right-to-work state, from Washington state. The union in Washington protested the move, and the National Labor Relations Board has taken up its complaint. Republicans immediately pounced on the case as evidence of the Obama administration's business-unfriendly attitude--and even Gould, who served on the board in the Clinton administration, is mystified by the NLRB's actions. * ""The Boeing case is unprecedented,"" he says. ""I agree with much of what this board has done and is likely to do, but I don't agree with what the general counsel has done in the Boeing case. The general counsel is trying to equate an employer's concern with strikes that disrupt production and make it difficult to make deadlines--he's trying to equate that with hostility toward trade unionism. I don't think that makes sense."" If this fight were limited to the facts so far, it might not be political. The complaint was filed by Lafe Solomon, the general counsel for the NLRB, who told the New York Times that he ""can't not issue a complaint"" when evidence like this is handed to him. The NLRB's political appointees haven't weighed in yet; they won't do so until the board holds a hearing next month. Republicans in South Carolina have been less shy. ""The administration is acting like a bunch of thugs,"" said Sen. Jim DeMint. ""If this is checks and balances, God help our country,"" said Gov. Nikki Haley. ""This is nothing more than bullying by the labor unions. This is President Obama and Harry Reid carrying their water."" And so on. When I talked briefly to Haley earlier this month, she was insistent: Every Republican presidential candidate must explain ""how would you have handled this situation had it been under your presidency."" When Boeing's General Counsel Michael Luttig appeared before the Senate last week, Republicans showered him with sympathy over what the situation could do to jobs and griped about the Obama administration. This might surprise the unions, if their members were dewy-eyed innocents who'd never met Republicans before. They're not. They figured this would turn political. They almost take pride in it. ""Boeing's made it into a political argument, but it's really a legal case,"" says Connie Kelliher, a spokeswoman for International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Local 751, the Washington union that filed the complaint with the NLRB. ""Because they don't have a legal argument, they want to make it political argument."" Here's the legal argument made by the union and the NLRB. The Wagner Act prohibits companies from moving operations to avoid unions. On Feb. 28, the Seattle Times published an interview with Boeing's CEO, Jim Albaugh, in which he seemed to say, yes, Boeing was basically doing that. ""The overriding factor was not the business climate,"" explained Albaugh, ""and it was not the wages we are paying today. It was that we can't afford to have a work stoppage every three years. And we can't afford to continue the rate of escalation of wages."" That, say the unions, is all the proof you need. But Gould and other critics say that while the board may look kindly upon the complaint, its position won't stand up in the courts. The NLRB, for its part, denies that it's a political fight at all (although it launched Fact Check page on its website, which--possibly a first for the Obama administration--rebuts a claim made on RedState.com). ""It wouldn't have mattered if the complaint was about moving from a union state to another union state,"" said the NLRB's public affairs director Nancy Cleeland, a former labor reporter for the Los Angeles Times. ""It has nothing to do with right-to-work states. These are the issues we deal with every day."" For Republicans, that's the main issue: the very existence of the NLRB. The board has a Democratic majority only because President Obama recess-appointed Craig Becker, a former AFL-CIO and SEIU counsel. In February, 176 House Republicans voted for an amendment to the budget bill that would have completely defunded the board. The nagging treatment that Bill Gould remembered from the 1990s was one stage in a very long war against the reforms of the New Deal. We're deep into the latest stage of the war. Republicans are much more confident that the public wants them to win it. The anti-labor side turned on a dime from opposing the now-hopeless Employee Free Choice Act to opposing the Boeing complaint. This side includes groups like the Workforce Fairness Institute, which according to its last available tax forms has four directors, no full-time employees, and a $10 million budget. It includes basically every Republican politician in South Carolina, who all have full confidence that the state is on their side. In 2010, the state voted on a constitutional amendment to ban something like EFCA--which would have let workers organize without secret ballots--from ever going into effect. The NLRB called it unconstitutional. It passed with 86.2 percent of the vote. ""I'd be surprised if this complaint was politically motivated,"" says Andy Arnold, a lawyer and Democratic activist in Greenville, S.C., who works on labor issues in the state. ""Most people do politically motivated things when they stand to benefit from them. I mean, does Barack Obama benefit from it? He wouldn't win South Carolina in a million years.""

This prediction is based in part on reports I am hearing of tentative progress: Administration sources say both sides are agreeing to cuts in spending in a cordial and serious process, and that the cuts are distributed among the constituents of both parties. If they continue making progress, they'll be able to win the votes from House Republicans and nervous Senate Democrats to pass a debt ceiling increase. But you don't need to know any of that to make this prediction. You simply need to recognize exactly where we are in the midst of a familiar storyline. The debt ceiling fight is just like the fight over funding to keep the government from shutting down, which was just like the fight over extending the Bush tax cuts, which was just like ... well, you get the idea. Washington has become a Saturday serial like the kind they showed at the cinema in the middle of the last century. Each episode ends with a cliffhanger in which the hero or heroine is placed in a situation of imminent peril, from which there is no possible escape. Viewers had to return the next week to see how the last cliffhanger was successfully resolved and be introduced to the next cliffhanger. Here's a brief viewers' guide to the action so that you can anticipate what's going to happen next and comfort your little sister, who is easily scared: It's All About Economic Fear. All sides agree that failing to reach a deal on tax cuts/ funding the government/raising the debt ceiling would severely affect the fragile recovery. Agreement on this fact foreshadows the happy ending because in the end no wants to get stuck with the blame for harming the economy. No New Taxes. Republicans refuse to support any deal that includes a tax increase. The president met with Republican senators last week and said any significant deficit reduction required to raise the debt ceiling could not be reached without some kind of tax increase. A House leadership aide says that House Speaker John Boehner expects the president to cave on this position as he did on tax cuts for the wealthiest. Hostage-Taking. Last year, the president famously said ""Republicans [were] holding middle-class tax relief hostage because they're insisting we've got to give tax relief to millionaires and billionaires."" During the shutdown fight that was Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer's claim. Last week White House spokesman Jay Carney took up the charge. Enter the Vice President. To solve the situation, Joe Biden is called in to negotiate with leaders of both parties. The meetings are cordial. He appears afterward to offer his assessment of how well they went. No Progress. News accounts say that no progress is being made. Pundits sound the alarm. Progress. Meanwhile, negotiators are making progress. Pundits sound the alarm. DemocraticFreakout. Democratic officials complain that the president isn't doing enough. He's selling them out in a final deal with Republicans. Democratic senators expressed this sentiment in a meeting with Obama and his aides last week. Tea Party Freakout. Various Tea Party-affiliated activists claim that House GOP leaders are selling out. (This also happens with each sunrise.) Uh-Oh, Daddy'sHome. Obama weighs in and tells both sides to stop playing politics in order to get a deal. If you want a good seat for this coming act, go to the White House briefing room: That's where he did it during the tax cut fight and government shutdown tussle. We're All Doomed. News reports quote aides who say both sides have never been farther apart. A deal, if there ever was one, is crumbling. Let's Make a Deal. Both sides believe doing nothing would harm the economy; they make a deal. That pressures the president because he'll get the large share of the blame if the economy slides. Republicans make a deal because they are boasting they're the adults in Washington, and shutting down the government or defaulting on its obligations doesn't suggest adult behavior. Saturday serial hero Captain Marvel had a niftier suit than the boxy ones Washington politicians wear. But his ability to avert a crisis that looked certain to cause destruction was just as predictable. Of course, Captain Marvel faced outside forces of doom. In Washington, the politicians are just saving themselves from themselves. Become a fan of  John Dickerson  on Facebook."	Why Obama and the Republicans will reach an agreement on the debt ceiling.

7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/05/lets_get_to_the_real_debate.html	"Does the death of Osama Bin Laden mean the United States should speed up the drawdown of troops from Afghanistan? Congressional leaders of both parties are saying it does, as are, reportedly, some advisers in certain quarters of the White House. There are certainly legitimate arguments for winding down the war or altering the strategy. But they have little to do with the fact that the leader of al-Qaida is sleeping with the fishes. First, as critics of the war have pointed out in different contexts, many Taliban factions have no connection with al-Qaida. If Bin Laden wasn't running or even much inspiring the insurgents in his lifetime, his abrupt demise isn't likely to grind the fighting to a halt. (Then again, if his diaries and thumb drives prove that he really was in charge of the Afghan Taliban, this calculation changes enormously.) Second, those Taliban leaders who did have personal ties with Bin Laden--for example, Mullah Omar--may now have less reason to fight on. The possibility is at the very least worth probing. But it's not at all clear that rubbing out the godfather makes his capos more amenable to reconciling with the Western-backed Afghan government. Some of Mullah Omar's deputies or ground commanders might now find the notion more alluring. But officials say they've seen no spurt of defections in the 10 days since the raid on Abbottabad. Third, the war in Afghanistan has never been entirely about killing or capturing Bin Laden. It's a big deal that he's been killed. Al-Qaida has lost not merely a figurehead but its political and spiritual leader, the seemingly invincible embodiment of its whole mythic narrative. But the organization and its dream aren't dead; its franchise managers, however splintered and paranoid, can still wreak much damage. More to the point, Afghanistan, in its current state, would very likely tumble into anarchy or civil war without the binding presence (however tenuous) of U.S. and NATO troops--and thus serve, again, as a sanctuary for terrorists. Of particular concern here are the most-militant jihadists, who could turn the lawless terrain into a cross-border expanse from which to plan and execute their ambitions in nuclear-armed Pakistan. This has been the real aim of the war, to the extent an aim has been articulated--to keep Afghanistan stable, at least to the point where the country can't be taken over by forces intent on attacking others or fomenting upheaval in Pakistan. It's maddening that Pakistan has done so little to quell this threat to its own survival. Or, to put it more precisely, it's maddening that Pakistan's military and intelligence services are split into factions, some of whose interests are aligned with the jihadists--and that Pakistan's civilian government is too weak to root out those elements. But this is the trap in which we find ourselves. The killing of Bin Laden would have momentous impact on the Afghan war--and on world politics--if some Pakistani leaders used the occasion to force systemic institutional reforms. Many countries' leaders would be compelled to make vast changes if it were suddenly revealed that they'd been harboring the world's most wanted mass murderer for five years--and that a foreign power can mount a military raid deep inside its borders without triggering the slightest detection, much less resistance. In just about any other country on earth, a leader would use this double embarrassment as an opportunity to clean house, chop heads, overhaul rival power networks. But this is Pakistan, where the institutions suspected of harboring the mass murderer--and responsible for protecting borders--are in charge and in deep cahoots with the militant jihadists whose very existence jeopardizes the fate of the country. (For an enlightening history of this self-destructive symbiosis, see Pakistan: Between Mosque and Military, by Husain Haqqani. Interestingly, Haqqani wrote the book in 1995, when he was in exile at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, D.C. Now he is Pakistan's ambassador to the United States and so spends much of his time trying, in effect, to convince our officials that his book's thesis isn't true.) And so, the real potential ""game-changer"" of Bin Laden's killing--that it might force the Pakistanis to break away from their darkest historical remnants and pursue a more civilized path--isn't likely to happen. This is the case not just because the military and the Islamists share the same power base, but also because the Taliban are a useful tool in Pakistan's rivalry with India. Pakistanis view India as a much greater threat to their national survival than the Taliban or even al-Qaida. They continue to support certain elements of the Taliban--they want these elements to thrive in Afghanistan--in order to maintain a policy of ""strategic depth"" against what they see as their larger enemy. Should India invade (and there have been a few wars between the two countries since the 1947 partition), a friendly Afghanistan would be a strategic reserve. In the meantime, a strong Taliban helps counter India's efforts to create a presence in Afghanistan--in other words, helps to pre-empt India's encirclement of Pakistan. The death of Osama Bin Laden doesn't alter these factors. However, domestic political pressures are building for President Barack Obama to speed up his plans to get out of Afghanistan. In December 2009, when Obama announced his plans to send in an extra 30,000 troops (on top of the 24,000 he added the previous March), he also said that he would begin to withdraw some of them by July 2011. (More recently, NATO announced that all troops would come out by the end of 2014.) With the magic date just two months away, the debate has begun over just how many U.S. troops--out of the current 100,000--Obama should withdraw and how many of those should be combat troops. Many are arguing that Obama should use the killing of Osama as an excuse (as Sen. George Aiken once proposed that President Lyndon Johnson do in the early years of the Vietnam War) to ""declare victory and get out."" It must be tempting. The war's costs, in dollars and lives, are exorbitant. Despite the tactical victories that Gen. David Petraeus is racking up, the broader counterinsurgency strategy--which involves ""winning hearts and minds"" in order to get the Afghan people to support their government--doesn't seem to be working, not least because the Afghan government is too corrupt or incompetent to earn their trust. (For the latest on this, see Jon Lee Anderson's depressing report in the May 11 New Yorker.) But if it matters to U.S. interests how the war ends--whither Afghanistan and its effects on the broader region--then it's a bad idea simply to walk away. And it's fairly clear that the outcome does matter to U.S. interests. This doesn't mean we should necessarily ""stay the course."" We are getting out, if not in two months then (officially) in three years. All the players--the Afghan government, the Taliban, the Pakistanis, the Afghan people--are already behaving in anticipation of our departure. So we should, first of all, recognize that fact and make the most of it. Afghan President Hamid Karzai must be extremely nervous that Obama will do what many in Congress, and some in the White House, are hoping--cite Bin Laden's death as an excuse to go home. So we should exploit this situation, use it as leverage to get Karzai to step up reforms, especially to take meaningful steps toward ending corruption. As every U.S. leader has publicly stated, from Obama on down to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and the entire military chain of command, even the most effective military campaign will have little effect if the Afghan people regard their government as illegitimate. At the same time, commanders and diplomats should exploit whatever fissures Bin Laden's death might have opened up--not just between the various Taliban factions but, more, between the insurgent commanders, who tend to lounge in the shelters of Pakistan, and the foot soldiers bleeding on the battlefields of Afghanistan. It's unclear at this point whether a diplomatic settlement is possible, or what it would look like--but it's time to start seriously crafting its foundations. It's also time for a serious diplomatic push outside Afghan borders. Early in his presidency, Obama recognized that this problem was regional in nature--and that the solution would have to be, too. The late Richard Holbrooke coined the term ""AfPak,"" to suggest its scope, but stopped short of AfPakInd, which captures things more fully. The leaders of India were the obstacle here, insisting that they be left out of any regional package, wanting to be dealt with individually, on their own terms, as the world's largest, and one of its fastest-growing, democracies. They had a point, but it's time to bunch the three countries together anyway, at least in a security forum, and perhaps to include Russia, China, and other interested parties as well. This is difficult, maybe close to impossible. But without dealing with this dimension, the problem won't be solved. Which brings us to the issue that Bin Laden's death has revived as a debatable topic: the question of U.S. troops. The fact is that the United States needs leverage in order to apply the necessary pressure (to get Karzai moving on reform, the Pakistanis and Indians to get moving on detente, and the other regional and global powers to offer security guarantees, economic incentives, or whatever a peaceful arrangement requires)--and we will have no leverage if everyone thinks we're getting out quickly. It's a delicate matter: holding out the possibility of a rapid pullout, to exert leverage on some fronts--while demonstrating a continued presence, and keeping up the military pressure, to exert leverage on other fronts. Maybe Obama's new national-security team--especially Ryan Crocker, the incoming ambassador in Kabul--can juggle all these swords. Maybe it's just not possible. There are two alternatives to this approach: keep doing what we've been doing and stay there forever while the regional politics continue to stagnate--or just get out and watch it all crumble. This is what the real debate should be about: what we want Afghanistan and its surroundings to look like in, say, five years--and how best to make that so. Anything else is a distracting cop-out."	Osama Bin Laden's dead; should we get out of Afghanistan?	['Obama']	[]
8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/05/zawahiris_big_challenge.html	"""The secret of successful managing,"" claimed legendary baseball manager Casey Stengel, ""is to keep the five guys who hate you away from the four guys who haven't made up their minds."" Ayman al-Zawahiri, the Egyptian jihadist who is presumed to be Osama Bin Laden's heir as head of al-Qaida, would do well to heed Stengel's advice. Al-Zawahiri, unlike Bin Laden, does not have the unabashed admiration of much of the jihadist community, and he has a history of angering and alienating other jihadists. He will find it hard to assume Bin Laden's mantle, and even if he does so, his hold on the leadership of al-Qaida may prove precarious. On paper, al-Zawahiri's background seems perfect for an aspiring terrorist leader. Journalist Lawrence Wright reports that al-Zawahiri formed his first terrorist cell in 1966, when he was only 15 years old. He then plotted against the Egyptian regime, which, he felt, had surrendered its legitimacy by making peace with Israel and failing to establish an Islamic state. He then spent several years in Egypt's jails after some of his comrades assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981, and after his release he fled to Pakistan during the anti-Soviet jihad. When al-Qaida was founded in 1988, al-Zawahiri was by Bin Laden's side. Like Bin Laden, he spent time in Sudan when Khartoum embraced jihadist terrorists in the early 1990s, and later he was with Bin Laden in Afghanistan in the runup to 9/11. After those devastating attacks, his role became perhaps even more important. Al-Zawahiri, designed al-Qaida's strategy and issued so many speeches that Brookings Institution terrorism analyst Bruce Riedel declared him al-Qaida's ""Chatty Cathy."" Al-Zawahiri came late to Bin Laden's view that the United States was the deeper source of the Muslim world's problems. He initially focused his fire on Egypt and other Arab regimes, even claiming ""Jerusalem will not be conquered unless Cairo is conquered and the battle in Egypt and Algeria is won."" His movement was crushed in Egypt, however, and the struggle against Algeria's regime stalled before degenerating into brutal slaughter of civilians. His group ran out of money, so by necessity as well as ideology he moved closer and closer to Bin Laden's anti-U.S. credo, embracing it wholeheartedly by 1998. After 9/11, a U.S. airstrike killed al-Zawahiri's wife and two of his sons, adding a personal motive to his already strong hatred of America. While Bin Laden tried to transcend the divisions within the jihadist movement, al-Zawahiri often exacerbated them, especially by his denunciations of rival jihadist groups. He reserved particular vitriol for the Muslim Brotherhood, the largest and most important Islamist movement in the Arab world, and Hamas, a Brotherhood spinoff that runs Gaza. Such pronouncements may be the traditional job of the No. 2: He is the hatchet man, allowing the leader to get the glory. Part of it is clearly his personality, however. Al-Zawahiri waded into the numerous fights within the Egyptian jihadist movement in the 1980s and '90s. The movement divided over whom to attack, where to base themselves, and how much to cooperate with like-minded (but not like-minded-enough) Islamist movements. Al-Zawahiri would often bitterly castigate those he felt were insufficiently zealous. Putting aside his divisive tendencies, his public statements prove that he is not as telegenic as his late Saudi companion, betraying a pedantic tone, overbearing manners, and impatience with his critics. Those who have met with Bin Laden often describe him as charismatic; no one says that about al-Zawahiri. Although al-Zawahiri's time in Egypt's jails and his years in the jihadist movement--far longer than Bin Laden--give him street cred, jihadists are well aware of his shortcomings. In jail and under torture, al-Zawahiri betrayed his comrades. He later wrote ""The toughest thing about captivity is forcing the mujahid [fighter in a holy cause], under the force of torture, to confess about his colleagues, to destroy his movement with his own hands, and offer his and his colleagues' secrets to the enemy."" Perhaps even a hardened jihadist understands that the brutal ministrations of Egypt's Interior Ministry can force a man to talk, but this forgiveness surely tempers their admiration for al-Zawahiri. During his first stint in Pakistan during the 1980s, al-Zawahiri saw the anti-Soviet effort in Afghanistan as a sideshow. He focused his organizational efforts, including the training camp affiliated with his Egyptian group, on the fight back home in Egypt. This may cost him. The Taliban in particular felt honor-bound to stand by Bin Laden, who had stood by Afghans during the 1980s and '90s. Their debt to al-Zawahiri is much less keen. To fill the void created by Bin Laden's death, al-Zawahiri must build trust not only with Egyptian members of al-Qaida who have fought and quarreled with him over the decades, but also with the Libyans, Algerians, Saudis, Yemenis, and others who have joined its ranks. Strengthening these bonds in his new role requires meeting in person with key lieutenants in order to build rapport and communicating with them and others on a regular basis. He also needs to send a message to jihadists around the world, assuring them that while Bin Laden is dead, al-Qaida lives on. This all sounds simple, but the intense drone campaign against al-Qaida in Pakistan, to say nothing of intelligence that could be gleaned from material taken during the deadly raid on Bin Laden's compound, makes such basic tasks far more difficult. U.S. intelligence forces are far more likely to locate al-Qaida figures when they talk on the phone, meet with associates, or otherwise expose themselves--the very things they need to do to smooth a leadership transition. The risk for al-Zawahiri is not just to his personal safety but to al-Qaida's long-term health. The death of Bin Laden was a huge blow. Losing the new leader in short succession would send a message that the organization is near collapse. Because there is no obvious successor to al-Zawahiri (we al-Qaida watchers all have our money on different candidates), the disarray could snowball, leading to a decline in fundraising and recruitment that further weakens the group. Those thrust into power after a charismatic leader falls sometimes reveal unanticipated depths or an unsuspected ability to build on their predecessor's legacy. Al-Zawahiri may have learned about leadership and changed his ideology under Osama Bin Laden's tutelage, and his long track record as a jihadist strategist makes it foolish to count him out. However, this is a time of opportunity for U.S. counterterrorism. Al-Zawahiri's hold on the leadership is unsteady, and constant pressure can further shake it and bring al-Qaida closer to collapse."

9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/05/people_who_liked_this_candidate_also_liked_.html	"Eleven years ago, no one thought that Newt Gingrich could run for president. He was a spent force. He'd resigned as speaker of the House, then gotten divorced, then married his mistress, who was 23 years his junior. Political career: over. Retirement: accomplished. Gingrich found a hobby. Once a week, more or less, he would log onto Amazon and upload a review of a book he'd just put down. ""He does not review all of the books he reads,"" warned his staff-written reviewer bio--the only part of his Amazon personality that isn't written by him. ""You will not find any bad reviews here, just the books he thinks you might enjoy."" It couldn't last forever. Starting in 2005, Gingrich was cranking out a book of his own every 10 months or so. Starting today, he's a candidate for the White House. He hasn't written a new Amazon review since February 2008. ""Too busy,"" explains Gingrich spokesman Rick Tyler. ""Had to give it up."" That's too bad. The Gingrich who reviewed 156 books on Amazon was neither the fire starter who led the GOP's 1994 revolution nor the guy who told National Review that President Obama can only be understood through the prism of ""Kenyan anti-colonial thinking."" He was a smart nerd with a lot of time on his hands. If you read his entire collected Amazonian oeuvre, you can watch as an easily entertained quantum physics junkie slowly realizes that he needs to get back into politics and set the rest of us straight--one last time. Gingrich was a master of blurb-speak; it's a surprise he didn't end up cited on the back covers of more paperbacks. On Robert B. Parker's thriller  Potshot: ""Parker has done it again."" On Mark Bowden's drug war classic  Killing Pablo: ""Bowden has done it again."" On Ken Follett's  Jackdaws: ""Follett has done it again."" And the Amazonian Gingrich was ahead of his time on foreign policy. He stayed that way by reading a mix of popular histories and spy thrillers.  Joshua's Hammer, a David Hagberg novel that Gingrich reviewed shortly before 9/11, posited a fictional threat and its aftermath from a terrorist who, at that point, was known mostly for the bombing of the USS Cole. ""The plot involves bin Laden sympathizers in Central Asia that may have infiltrated the vulnerable Russian system,"" Gingrich explains. ""Bin Laden wants to use this threat to achieve an American withdrawal from his homeland of Saudi Arabia. The United States deciding it can take no chances launches a preemptive strike using Tomahawk cruise missiles to hit bin Laden's camp. Nevertheless, the action neither kills him nor hurts the nuclear weapon. Bin Laden then decides to use the weapon in the United States and specifically targets someone close to the President who is in a very public setting along with thousands of other people."" There are, thankfully, no spoilers. There is, however, a strong conclusion: ""It will get you to think hard about the real dangers of terrorism and the challenge of creating a strong enough system to defeat it."" Gingrich the reviewer/wonk is an optimist, but not a fool. One of the first novels he reviewed after 9/11 was Humphrey Hawksley's  Dragon Strike, a novel about a fictional war between Pakistan and China. He gave it four stars, but the title of the review is ""Unlikely Scenario Post 9/11."" ""The recent terrorist attacks on America make this novel slightly less likely,"" Gingrich says, ""because we are almost certainly going to see a stronger American military and a closer American relationship with Pakistan, which will have a stabilizing influence."" But real-time political policy didn't feature too much in Gingrich's reviews. It may have been that the short blurb-plus-instant-thought format restricted what he could say. Only occasionally did he really let loose with an essay, and it was typically a reaction to some sweeping work of history. Gingrich fell in love with Victor Davis Hanson's  Carnage and Culture: Landmark Battles in the Rise of Western Power, ""a book any sophisticated student of war or any citizen concerned about the role of warfare in national survival would want to read."" Whenever he encountered a history that lent strength to his theories about the tort law threat, he gushed. Norman Cantor's history of the bubonic plague revealed something: ""The upper class in the middle ages spent an enormous amount of energy contracting, suing and maneuvering in the legal system."" Larry Kramer's  The People Themselves, published in 2004, would ""change history,"" Gingrich writes, with everything it revealed about the abuses of the law. Gingrich was often frustrated by stuff like this. He generally liked  Atlantis Found, one of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels. Reading it shortly after 9/11, though, he wondered whether Cussler had punted on his choice of villains. ""It is fascinating,"" Gingrich writes, ""that there are far more novels about totally improbable Nazi revenge than there are about tragically real Islamic medieval terrorism and there are far more novels about bad Germans 56 years after the Second World War than there are about all too real current acts of terror against Israel and the West or for that matter the terrorists who seek to destabilize India, the Philippines, Indonesia, etc."" There are plenty of thriller reviews in the Gingrich archives, and a few big pop science books about string theory and the Internet. These reviews are more revealing than the policy wonk stuff, which isn't surprising. We're talking about the politician who, in  To Renew America, mentioned the influence of Toynbee's  A Study of History in the same paragraph as Isaac Asimov's Foundation novels. Thrills and speculative fiction can, to use a favorite Gingrich phrase, ""stretch the mind."" It might not make sense when you hear Gingrich warning of the danger of electro-magnetic pulse attacks or making analogies between World War II and multiple current conflicts. It makes more sense when you see what fiction he reads. ""If at some future time we discover that someone really vicious has acquired a very advanced weapon system by bribing a disgruntled military member of a decaying system,"" Gingrich writes in 2002 review, ""we should not be surprised if we read  Kilo Option."" By the time he wrapped up his reviewing career, Gingrich seemed frustrated. The long-term strategic threats of radical Islam or loose nukes should have been so obvious. The worst-case scenarios had been spelled out by countless novelists many times. By 2007, when he launched American Solutions, he could be confident that no one else in politics knew what he knew; no one else had spent so much time in exile. The way to look at his political comeback today? Don't think of him as a candidate. Think of him as Miles Bennell at the end of  The Invasion of the Body Snatchers, mind full of disaster scenarios that only he has seen, screaming at motorists: If you don't listento me, he's shouting, you're next."

10	10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/05/back_to_the_grind.html	"Almost seven days to the hour that President Obama announced that Osama Bin Laden had been killed, he appeared on 60 Minutes in his only interview about the operation. The week had been full of disclosures about the mission, but the president still made news. He was only about 55 percent sure beforehand that Bin Laden was in the compound. That he was there suggests some Pakistani officials knew Bin Laden was in the country. Obama never told his family about the operation. Perhaps the most fascinating part of the interview was watching Obama try not to admit that he was watching the 40-minute operation unfold in real time. After Live From Abbottabad, we now return to our regular programming. The Bin Laden killing was a singular moment of high drama. Now the president must turn to the scratchy partisan theater where progress on vital issues is frustratingly slow and he has limited influence over the public debate. The president's aides talk a lot about his equanimity. He doesn't get too high or too low. As if to test that proposition, he is following his week of adrenaline with a few tumblers of tryptophan. Tuesday he gave a speech in El Paso, Texas, on immigration reform, and Wednesday he'll participate in a CBS town-hall meeting on the economy. In planning the commando raid on the Bin Laden compound, the president ran meetings in which his military advisers sketched out the step-by-step process of how the raid would unfold using pictures of its layout. The president picked the riskiest option, which got even riskier when the helicopter crashed and the Navy SEALs had to blow holes in the wall instead of repel onto the roof. Compare that with a senior administration aide's description of what the president would be doing Tuesday in his speech on immigration: ""He will lead a constructive and civil debate. ... He is helping to elevate the debate. ... He held a meeting with some very high-level stakeholders ... including some new faces and voices for this debate. ... All of this has been aimed at expanding the number of voices and to elevating the debate ... acknowledging the reality that elevating the debate by himself is less likely to get us to an outcome than elevating this debate along with many other partners around the country."" Is there no limit to our imperial presidency? This will inexorably lead to a plenary session. Last week administration officials were blamed for embellishing an already impressive military action. It's the other 94 percent of the presidency they should be improving. After his remarks, the president will ride a Harley along the border and participate in a narcotics raid. The president was more specific than that preview would suggest. He did point to improvements in border security that have slowed the flow of illegal immigrants, though his push for comprehensive legislative reform was fuzzy. Republican opposition and an all-consuming budget debate limit the chances for immigration legislation. And before long the 2012 election is likely to get in the way. On Wednesday the president will also have to stretch for specificity. The stakes couldn't be higher. Voters care more about the economy than any other issue, and they are not happy with Obama's stewardship. Despite the overall improvement in Obama's approval rating after the Bin Laden killing, his approval ratings on the economy have dropped. His approval rating on the economy is at its lowest level in the CBS and NBC polls. The main driver, according to pollsters, is the high price of gasoline. What can he do about this? Nothing that will immediately satisfy voters. I asked his top economic adviser, Austan Goolsbee, who outlined the president's three-part energy strategy. It is mostly aimed at long-term fixes to keep the annual price spikes from happening in the future. The town-hall format is likely to exacerbate this disconnect across all economic issues. Audience members will be full of concern and want immediate action, and the president will not be able to solve their problems or counsel much more than patience. This formula led to an uncomfortable moment in a similar town hall in September. A woman who described herself as a ""middle-class American"" articulated the frustration people were having with the president's inability to deliver: ""I'm exhausted. Exhausted of defending you, defending your administration, defending the man for change I voted for, and deeply disappointed with where we are right now. I've been told that I voted for a man who said he was going to change things in a meaningful way for the middle class."" The next few weeks will be consumed with a debate over lifting the debt limit. There will be speeches, empty threats, and marathon negotiations at long polished wood conference tables. In his 60 Minutes interview, Obama said the raid ranked as among the longest 40 minutes of his life. But compared to the glacial pace of action on the president's domestic agenda and economic issues, those 40 minutes may soon feel to him like a blink of the eye. Become a fan of  John Dickerson  on Facebook."	After Osama: Obama turns to more mundane issues like gas prices and immigration.	['Obama']	[]
11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/05/sweet_nothings.html	"GREENVILLE, S.C.--The first debate between the candidates who would lead their party in 2012 led Rep. Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina , to ponder an existential question: So what's the point of debates, exactly? ""The notion that we can solve what ails our country and our economy in 60 seconds is driven by television,"" he said disdainfully, hobnobbing in the spin room after the debate, which included former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, former Gov. Gary Johnson of New Mexico, former Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, and businessman Herman Cain. ""What we really ought to have is Paul Ryan, with whoever the best economist who has the contrary viewpoint is, and a thorough discussion."" That didn't happen last night. Instead there was 90 minutes of sparring about weighty topics like economy and the capture of Osama bin Laden, and sparring about less weighty topics like legal heroin and Rick Santorum's 2005 book It Takes a Family. The consensus going in was that the lack of frontrunners in the room would minimize the importance of the event. The consensus going out was that the lack of frontrunners in the room minimized the importance of the event--and that Ron Paul's supporters are really loud. From the start of the day, the inaugural debate--sponsored by Fox News and the South Carolina Republican Party--didn't feel like an event that was gripping the city of Greenville, much less the nation. In the early afternoon, as a National Day of Prayer rally ended on a downtown plaza, a professional activist named Bob Kunst arrived, sat on a park bench, and held up one of his signs: ""OBAMA, Show Us Osama's Photo."" He'd driven up from Miami to protest ""gutless"" Republicans, he said, and it turned out that he was one of very few protesters who'd make the trip. As he sat, he engaged a Greenville local in a dialogue about what should be done with the corpse of the late terrorist. ""I'd put him in a glass box and display him at ground zero in New York,"" said the Greenville resident, pausing from his lunch. ""What we should do,"" said Kunst, ""is cover him in pig oil and march him into a gathering of the victims' families, and see what they do."" This was not the most serious conversation ever conducted about Bin Laden's fate, but in some way it jibed with the mood of the event. The very first question to the candidates was about Bin Laden's death; the first yes-or-no question was whether they'd want to release the military's photo of a bullet-riddled corpse. All of the candidates save for Cain raised their hands, indicating that they would. Asked about the details of the raid, they found ways to bend the question toward their own theories of what was learned and how terror could be thwarted. ""If it turns out that many of the techniques he criticized during the campaign led to Osama Bin Laden being captured or killed,"" said Pawlenty, ""he ought to explain that."" ""If you look at the decision to get Bin Laden,"" said Santorum, ""it was a tactical decision, not a strategic decision. The strategic decision was made by President Bush."" Pawlenty's take was factually murky; Santorum's take was factual nonsense, compounded when he suggested that Obama had only continued George W. Bush's policies in Afghanistan. If the goal of these soundbites was to confirm a Republican voter's impression of the Obama administration as weak and wrongfooted, it was neatly done. After this, the debate did Republicans a little less good. The mission of the GOP at the moment is to grind down Barack Obama's agenda, cut spending, convince voters they can create jobs, and avoid other issues like they're doused in insect pheromones. That last thing was hard to do in Greenville, because most of the party's potential, orthodox candidates skipped out on it.  (Buddy Roemer, the former congressman and governor of Louisiana *, forked over a $25,000 filing fee but was excluded on the grounds that no one's met a voter who actually supports him.) Paul and Johnson, the two libertarians in the race, made up 40 percent of the show and got something like 30 percent of the questions. The Fox News moderators, with stacks of research to draw on, raced across every issue that could possibly interest Republicans. No one was particularly happy about this. Every candidate got at least one question about a possible political vulnerability, which was odd considering the pre-debate wisdom that only one of the candidates--Pawlenty--had the media and donor credibility to make it to the nomination. He had to become a credible not-Romney candidate, and do it in a state where Romney drastically underperformed in 2008. He did so, by making no huge mistakes, and by being the first candidate to wade into the state's dispute with the National Labor Relations Board over unionization. If he had no memorable lines, he might have been saving those for the high-stakes debate. It became clear very quickly that all the non-Pawlenty candidates didn't have much at stake. Paul, who starts the race with the biggest grassroots fundraising network, good poll numbers, and no pundit thinking he can win, veered between protecting his vulnerabilities and screwing with the moderators. He said Israel ""didn't need us telling it what to do,"" meant to be a calming line for conservatives who fear his isolationism. He was also so bemused by a question about drug legalization that he ended his answer with a wacky impression of a heroin user. And why shouldn't he be bemused? As he debated, a one-day moneybomb for his campaign was raising more than $1 million. Johnson and Santorum arguably had more at stake. Both of their political careers initially ended in the aughts, and both have discovered that the only way to make the media pay attention to their ideas is to run for president. On Thursday, that worked for Santorum, who has spent much of his post-Senate career as a commentator for Fox News. It worked less well for Johnson, who was given to looping his answers back in on themselves, like unwieldy palindromes. ""With regard to unemployment benefits,"" said Johnson, answering a fairly easy question, ""I'm in the camp that believes that we as individuals, you know--we need a bit of help. So government helps out. But at the point at which it runs out, that's when we really deal with the problems that we have. And as individuals, that's when we deal with those problems."" Johnson did better when he focused on the existential threat of government spending and debt--it's a problem, and we need to deal with it. Cain, the businessman and motivational speaker, just kept repeating that he had plans to solve problems, and the candidates with careers in politics didn't have plans. The thing about repeatedly saying you have a plan is that an audience believes it. Cain did well in a post-debate focus group conducted by Frank Luntz for Fox News because, to use some of their words, Cain was ""articulate"" and he ""had plans."" The news of the focus group spread quickly. When the debate ended, he waltzed into the spin room, made himself known to the press, and attracted the second-largest crowd of any candidate. Pawlenty attracted more reporters, at first, but he left quickly. Johnson made do with one or two reporters at a time, and spent some time ruing the moments he'd let get away from him. When he was asked about what sort of reality show he'd want, and he said it wouldn't be like Sarah Palin ""climbing on her hands and knees"" to explore Alaska? ""I didn't mean to do that,"" he sighed. ""That was probably the worst thing I said."" As the candidates talked, Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., held court in another part of the room. He had a litmus test, he said--he would not endorse any candidate who didn't support a balanced budget amendment as part of an increase in the debt ceiling. That struck me as a simple thing to ask for. Wouldn't it be easy for Republicans to commit to that, I asked, because the balanced budget amendment can't pass the Senate? Could they win him over with a pretty empty promise? ""It won't be as easy as they think,"" he said, ""because hopefully some of us will go to the mat with Democrats on this, and actually stall the debt ceiling vote until we get a balanced budget. We'll see how many candidates stay with us."" A bit later, in the same part of the room, Trey Gowdy kept sketching his ideal world. It was a world in which debates were long and wonky and serious, not about quick solutions but real reckoning on spending. It was a world in which Paul Ryan was on the debate stage, running for president. ""I ask him to, every day,"" said Gowdy. ""The answer's no.""

13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/05/the_smell_of_victory.html	"On Sunday night, Osama Bin Laden's death was announced to the world. On Monday morning, Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., cut to the chase. ""That's why we went into Afghanistan,""he said in an interview with ThinkProgress. ""We went there because Osama bin Laden had been using Afghanistan as a base from which to murder people, in the thousands."" Frank anticipated a backlash, and dismissed it immediately. ""People say, well, America can't look like it was driven out with the mission not accomplished. We went there to get Osama bin Laden!"" As the day went on, Democrat after Democrat agreed with Frank. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who chairs the Armed Services Committee, predicted that terrorist recruits would be scared off by Bin Laden's death and that the coming troop reduction in Afghanistan-- scheduled for August--could be ""robust."" Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., had recently failed to pass an amendment that would cut funding for the war. On Monday, he told the Huffington Post that ""we ought to stop wasting our troops and our money and our lives and get out."" To put it another way, the mission was accomplished. The House Democrats who are making these points the loudest don't run anything. When Nadler's amendment came up last month, it failed, with 91 Democrats voting for it and 99 voting against it. (Seven Republicans joined the ""nays."") In today's press conferences-cum-benedictions in Congress, Republican leaders did not take questions, but they subtly pushed back on any idea that the war would be drawing down. ""This makes our engagement in places like Pakistan and Afghanistan more important,"" said House Speaker John Boehner, ""not less."" Anti-war members have one advantage, and it's a considerable one. The public is with them. Last month, a Pew Research Poll found that only 44 percent of Americans wanted troops to stay in Afghanistan ""until the situation has stabilized."" Fifty percent of Americans disagreed. Three years ago, when Obama was campaigning for an Afghan surge, the numbers were 61 and 32. Around the same time, a Washington Post/ABC News Poll had 64 percent of voters saying the war was ""not worth fighting."" That was the highest the number had ever been. There is no candy-coating it: Support for the war has fallen off steadily. After Bin Laden, we're not likely to see a new wellspring of pro-war feeling. On Monday, war critics beat them to the punch in framing and describing what had happened in Abbottabad. ""Obviously, the operation that was successful did not require the military occupation of a nation,"" said Tom Andrews, the former Maine congressman who directs Win Without War. ""It required good intelligence. It required the capacity to execute a precision-based operation. And it demonstrates the sort of precision needed to fight terrorism. This is coming on the eve of the decision of the president to do an accelerated transition from Afghanistan."" The advocates of a quicker withdrawal are not necessarily doves. Only one member of Congress had opposed the legislation that started the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. (That member, Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Ca., said on Monday she was ""hopeful these developments will help to accelerate an end to the war in Afghanistan and the implementation of a smart security strategy."") The rest of the members who are looking for an exit explain their objection in cost terms, or realpolitik terms (about the folly of remaking Afghanistan with military force and aid). War supporters think they're engaging in realpolitik, too. The White House has not given any signal that Bin Laden's capture changes the overall strategy. As yet, no Republican who supported the war on Sunday has changed his mind. ""The other vital important reason for being in Afghanistan was to prevent the Taliban from establishing a safe haven for the al-Qaida network,"" said Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., on Monday afternoon. ""I don't think it fundamentally changes our mission in Afghanistan, just as it doesn't change the fundamental mission of al-Qaida."" But go back to the way Barney Frank described the war. What was the mission of the war, and what's been the lesson of it? The Afghanistan hawk's case would have been easier to make had Osama Bin Laden been caught in the country. He wasn't. Afghanistan didn't remain a ""safe haven"" for him--he found a safe haven in an ally of the United States, one that collects $3 billion of foreign aid every year. The debate on Afghanistan was likely to heat up in July. It will probably pick up sooner than that. On Thursday, Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., and other war skeptics will begin another attempt to scale back war funding with new legislation. ""Our reaction to the death of Bin Laden should be that we declare victory,"" said Jones on Monday. ""I think this changes the whole dynamics of the war on terrorism. Let's go after them. Let's not occupy a country for 10 years for nothing but a waste of lives."" Their opponent are stuck with an old script. They have a brand new one. Go ahead and call them defeatists, because they'll tell you they're celebrating victory."	Bin Laden's death: How anti-war members of Congress plan to take advantage.	['Jones', 'Obama']	[]

As early as last week, they saw that the special election for an open House seat in Western New York was breaking against them. They started explaining that if their candidate lost, and Democrat Kathy Hochul won, it would be the fluke to end all flukes. A spokesman for one of the conservative groups spending big in the district rhapsodized that ""the very earth would cry foul"" if Democrats tried to say that the election was about Paul Ryan's Medicare plan. Then the Democrat won. If the earth was crying about anything, it was missed next to the spectacle of Republicans tugging their collars and shaking off flop sweat. Republicans didn't pile on Ryan, who was anointed quite a long time ago as the intellectual leader of the Tea Party's congressional revolution. They just weren't very supportive. Of all the priorities Tea Party activists had for this Congress, the Ryan plan was unique. It was the only one that voters seem to have considered--and rejected. In another way, it wasn't unique. It's one of many House plans that melted upon contact with the Senate. On Wednesday, three other budget plans met the Ryan plan's fate and failed to pass cloture. The House voted to expand drilling licenses. That didn't make it through the Senate, either. Passing bills is hard. The Tea Party knew that already. Stopping stuff they don't like? That's much easier. Republicans have no intention, really, of letting President Obama fill out the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which the Affordable Care Act created as a way of rationing treatment. (Ryan, in his Wednesday clean-up after the election loss, has re-emphasized a choice between his plan and a panel of ""unelected bureaucrats,"" to argue that Democrats aren't exactly promising to save Medicare as we know it.) And how's the campaign going to get massive concessions in exchange for a hike in the debt ceiling? Just fine, thanks. Democrats are buckling on what sort of reforms they'll put up with. Polling shows that people are less worried about the apocalypse scenario of a debt default than they are about raising the ceiling. So, sure, the Medicare reform plan isn't going so well. It's an outlier. The Tea Party is still telling Washington what it's supposed to be working on every day. The Don't-Tread-on-Meter rises, slightly, to 50: Tea Partiers are halfway there. What Is the Don't-Tread-on-Meter?It will track the progress (or lack thereof) of the Republican House of Representatives, and the Republican conference in the Senate, in fulfilling the promises they made to Tea Party activists. The meter will hit 100 if and when the GOP does absolutely everything it promised. You can now add the Don't-Tread-on-Meter to your blog or site.

16	16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/05/what_did_he_just_say.html	"Joe Walsh, who has made more TV appearances than any other freshman in the House, is running late. It is not his fault. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to a joint session of Congress ran long--something to do with the 29 standing ovations he got--and as soon as it ends, Walsh bolts out the doors for his scheduled appearance at a Heritage Foundation luncheon. He arrives a little bit after 12:25 p.m. He kisses the receptionist's hand. He trips on a partially furled carpet, and turns the trip into a sort of Buster Keaton two-step, as if he'd planned it. The host, Robert Bluey, tells the audience that Walsh is just arriving from Netanyahu's speech. ""Woo!"" says Walsh, slapping his hands together and hot-footing it to his seat. His own energy level is at least 100 volts higher than the rest of the room. ""It was a masterful speech! He taught us all a history lesson, like he taught the president last week. And is so refreshing to hear a leader""--he pounds the table--""a giant, in that room."" He gives the crowd a preview of a column he's just written about how President Obama is ""not Israel's friend""--that's its headline when it is published the next day--with some eye-popping words about why American Jews are so liberal. It's sensational and it gets plenty of attention. Just about everything Walsh says is sensational and gets plenty of attention. In the week I talked to him, he challenged the president to secure the border even if took ""moats and alligators,"" and had a one-way spat with Sen. Scott Brown after Brown said he wouldn't support the Ryan budget. When I interview Walsh in his office--it wasn't hard to schedule--the Illinois Republican explains that he really didn't have a choice. ""I know there are Republicans who are afraid of the politics, but this is the call of our generation, to do something about this,"" he says. ""It's profound! And that's why when I hear that guys like Scott Brown or any Republicans ..."" He trails off and pumps his fist. ""I just wanna hit them. Politely. A nice, soft elbow to the guts. Come on, what are you thinking?"" It doesn't hurt Walsh at all to talk about punching people in the gut. It's how he won his seat. It's probably the only way he'll keep his seat. Since being sworn in less than six months ago, Walsh has appeared on prime time cable news or Sunday shows 28 times. When Congress is in session, he can appear more than once a week. What the cable bookers get is an excitable, handsome freshman who will say anything. On MSNBC, after the State of the Union, asked whether there should be a social safety net: ""No. It's not in the Constitution."" On ABC News after voting for the House GOP's funding bill--the one about three times larger than the compromise that passed: ""Keep cutting, baby."" How come he's on TV more than any other freshman? ""I think it goes to this,"" he says. ""A big freshman class comes to D.C., and here you've got one guy that said a lot of things during the campaign and he's doing everything he said. He's doing things that strike some people as unusual. Sleeps in the office. Turns down health benefits. Turns down pension benefits. Believes in term limits. Comes home all the time, holds more town halls than anybody. And then he's not at all afraid to talk about these things he believes in. So he's not afraid to go on MSNBC or CNN and get into a good jostling."" He racks his brain for any more reasons he's on TV. ""I mean, I'm a white male freshman congressman. There are a lot of those! I don't know."" There are other clues. Nobody thought Walsh would win. He'd worked for the libertarian Heartland Institute for a while, run for Congress in 1996, lost, run for state assembly, lost, then gone into the private sector but didn't make too much money. (His net worth, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, is negative $317,498.) Before doing this, he'd taken acting lessons--""stage, film, a little TV."" He raised only one-quarter as much as his Democratic opponent, Melissa Bean, who had seemed to turn the Republican-leaning district into a blue zone, even though a third party candidate kept splitting the vote. In mid-October, the Rothenberg Political Report confidently assessed that Walsh was not ""good enough to take advantage of a strong Republican year."" He got no money from national Republicans--not even the third-party groups that poured in cash for other longshot candidates. He won anyway. In his office, he's framed a gift from a Tea Party supporter that commemorates his victory. Margin of Victory: 261. For God, Family, Country. Local Democrats were crushed. ""I'm a big believer in 538.com,"" says Mike Bissett, the chairman of the McHenry County Democrats in the district. ""They were showing Bean had something like a 90 percent chance of victory, but predicting she'd only win by one or two points. I said, well, that doesn't make sense. And then he won. If I had to put money on it, though, it would be unlikely that he'd win again."" The reason Democrats think they can get rid of Walsh: Illinois is one of the few states where Democrats control every lever of the redistricting process. It would be incredibly easy for Democrats to redraw the districts in the Chicago suburbs to box out Walsh. The plans will come out soon; the rumor is that Walsh and other Republicans will have to fight it out in primaries for the remaining districts. How do you survive a situation like that, if you're a freshman who was never supposed to win? It can't hurt to be the freshman who appears on TV more than anyone else. It can't hurt if you're constantly holding town halls--Walsh has done 31 of them, some co-organized by Tea Party groups and Illinois's branch of Americans of Prosperity. It actually doesn't hurt him that he's not introducing many bills. He's introduced three so far, but one is the Balanced Budget Amendment that House conservatives are going to demand as part of a deal to raise the debt ceiling. Walsh might end up carrying the ball on a key Republican priority. ""We all have strengths and weaknesses,"" he says. ""We are all better at certain things than others. I still am someone who doesn't understand the way the legislative process works. I do, but I don't. I can't find my way around the Capitol. I have a hard time with protocol. But advocating for issues and speaking in front of people comes easily. I'm a pretty good advocate, which is probably one reason why people are constantly asking me to be on TV to advocate positions."" If Walsh gets a few more lucky breaks, and he gets a district to campaign in next year, he'll have to confront another problem. President Obama will be on the ticket. Obama has never won less than a landslide in Illinois. He's always carried the Chicago suburbs. I ask Walsh why he thinks that's true. ""Look,"" he says, ""I don't think this is complicated. He doesn't really have a history. I say all of this respectfully--he is the least well-known guy we have ever put in the presidency, and there's no one even close. He's probably got easily the lightest resume of anybody we've elected."" Walsh leans forward and taps me on the knee with a bumper sticker. ""Why was he elected? Again, it comes back to who he was. He was black, he was historic. And there's nothing racist about this. It is what it is. If he had been a dynamic, white, state senator elected to Congress he wouldn't have gotten in the game this fast. This is what made him different. That, combined with the fact that your profession""--another friendly tap of the bumper sticker--""not you, but your profession, was just absolutely compliant. They made up their minds early that they were in love with him. They were in love with him because they thought he was a good liberal guy and they were in love with him because he pushed that magical button: a black man who was articulate, liberal, the whole white guilt, all of that."" It's jarring to hear a congressman say that, but there are a lot of people who agree with him. Walsh has a gift for saying out loud things that many Republicans believe but won't say, and he says them because he's worried. He'd been hoping Mitch Daniels got into the race. He wanted someone who offered voters the complete opposite of what they'd gotten from Obama. ""I pity the candidate running against him, because it will continue,"" he says. ""That profession will protect him, and they will crucify whoever the Republican nominee is."" Republicans are sure that's what happened in 2008. A lot of Sarah Palin's appeal is based on a revanchist idea that she was blistered by a media that wanted to protect Obama at any Republican's expense. Walsh is the conservative who's absorbed that lesson and figured out that if you talk enough, the spotlight finds you."	Rep. Joe Walsh: He'll say anything, which is why he's interviewed everywhere.

17	17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/05/the_sound_of_settling.html	"Boringness can be a virtue. Boring people don't find themselves at the center of colorful sex scandals, with photos of their chests in the inboxes of Craigslist users. Boring people don't punch people who come at them with video cameras. Boring people can sometimes get awfully far in politics. Not too far, though. You probably don't care much about Tim Pawlenty finally, officially announcing his 2012 presidential campaign today. One reason you don't care is that at a crucial time in 2008, any Republican who mattered decided he was boring. Pawlenty, then the governor of Minnesota--he'd survived a close re-election campaign, partly because his opponent exploded and called a reporter a ""Republican whore""--made it on to John McCain's running-mate shortlist. McCain's team looked him over and went for Sarah Palin instead. ""In any normal year, Tim Pawlenty's a great pick, a no-brainer,"" said McCain campaign manager Steve Schmidt, according to one account in Mark Halperin's and John Heilemann's  Game Change. ""But this isn't a normal year. We need to have a transformative, electrifying moment in this campaign."" ""Electrifying"" meant Sarah Palin. Palin became a bright, burning supernova in the Republican cosmos. Pawlenty remained a marginal figure, closely watched by the political class but a total nonentity everywhere else. (One example: There is no Pawlenty role in HBO's  Game Change movie.) Every couple of days, there is a boomlet for another Republican savior. Every boomlet comes with a sub rosa message from Republican pundits: Please, please, give us someone besides Pawlenty. This is seriously unfair to Pawlenty, but you can understand what his party's thinking. If prospective candidates were universities, and the Republican primary voter were a high-school senior applying to college, then Pawlenty would be the safety school. A bland, solid Midwestern land-grant university. The problem with a safety school, of course, is that no one's in a hurry to RSVP ""yes"" to it. David Frum, who occasionally predicts that Pawlenty will win the nomination, puts it another way: ""Predicting Pawlenty feels like reaching the wrong answer on a math exam. You do the calculation and you arrive at the answer, Pawlenty. You think: That can't be right."" Why is Pawlenty such a hard sell to Republicans? It may be a matter of branding. Whatever a candidate seems to be, people try to find it in his speeches. Mitt Romney is branded as a guy who will say anything, so his speeches are combed for evidence of flip-flops. Sarah Palin is branded as an angry mom who'll say anything and reaches the boiling point after the most minor insult; her speeches, tweets, and Facebook notes are read like the Kabbalah for more proof of the theory. Pawlenty is branded as boring. He's actually had to field questions about how boring he is. ""There may be some more people who are dramatically more entertaining, but [they] probably aren't getting elected,"" he told Scott Conroy in an early interview about the Dull Factor. He's aware of the problem--the first step!--but it doesn't necessarily help him. His public remarks are scanned for boringness. A dull speech, one in which he repeats the same stories about growing up in South St. Paul, Minn., or chides Barack Obama for not being proud enough of America, doesn't make any news. What makes news is a reference to a Will Ferrell movie or a tortured analogy involving Charlie Sheen. Sometimes it's the release of yet another Lucas Baiano-produced campaign video that's a little too flashy for Zack Snyder. The videos are flashy, we're told, because the candidate can't spark any excitement of his own. Pawlenty has an acute sense of how this may play out. Like he says, the people who ""are dramatically more entertaining"" can't win the election. Pawlenty earns a fraction of the media attention Donald Trump got, or Palin gets. That's because he doesn't blunder into as many stupid stories as they do, and the public doesn't dislike him as much. He's generic at a time when the only candidate who outpolls Obama is ""Generic Republican."" He worked hard to be generic. His record after eight years of governing Minnesota has proven to be a small, slippery target for opposition researchers. The attacks on him from Democrats and from Democratic-aligned ""nonpartisan"" groups, like the Center for American Progress Action Fund, focus mostly on his say-anything approach to interviews in the conservative media. (Sympathetic interviewers have got him to say that he wants the military's ""Don't Ask Don't Tell"" policy reinstated, and that the debt ceiling doesn't need to be raised.) The oppo pros have only lightly touched on his gubernatorial record to find compromises that could sour Republicans on him. He briefly supported regional cap and trade; he briefly OK'd ""sharia compliant"" financing; he had a light touch with gubernatorial pardons (the latter is always a problem for governors). These are all minor problems for Republican voters. None of them has the megaton impact of Romney's health care record. All of them subtly soften the image of someone who, in different circumstances, Democrats would portray as a stealthy, right-wing evangelical Christian. A few conservative pundits have noticed this. George Will suggested that only Obama, Pawlenty, or Mitch Daniels could take the oath of office in January; after this weekend, the list shrank to two. In a longish piece for National Review, unfortunately titled ""Pawlenty To Like,"" Ramesh Ponnuru did the Frum equation and explained why the uncontroversial former governor of a swing state was, ""on paper ... a great candidate."" Stanley Kurtz made the same argument by ribbing fellow conservatives for being so picky. The ideal Republican presidential candidate, obviously, is a reincarnation of Ronald Reagan with the personal wealth of Mitt Romney. More broadly, the best sort of candidate any party can nominate is one who's not moderate but convinces swing voters that he is. That was one reason Obama was so attractive to liberal donors in 2007 and 2008. Hillary Clinton came out of the reformist, Democratic Leadership Council school of politics, but over a couple of decades, conservatives had convinced a pretty large number of voters that she was a committed socialist. Obama had no such problem--voters thought he was more moderate than his record suggested he was. That's a sweet place to be. Pawlenty's been there for approximately 10 years. So let everyone else write their ""Please, please, can we have a more exciting candidate?"" stories. Let Republican strategists give blind quotes to Politico about how they're ready to put the band together for some savior, if only the saviors would stop chickening out. Remember what happened the last time Republicans bypassed Pawlenty because he was too boring? If Republicans don't want to live through that again, the ""no-brainer"" is waiting for them."

18	18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/05/the_ryan_referendum.html	"WILLIAMSVILLE, N.Y.--Kathy Hochul has arrived at an assisted-living facility in this Buffalo suburb, and she's brought the gift of gloom. She asks for a few minutes of time from the dozen senior citizens here, and small-talks with the ones who seem interested. ""I've been married 73 years,"" says one of them. ""Seventy-three years!"" says Hochul, bending over to talk to him. ""I want to know your secret."" ""Don't die!"" he says. She laughs out loud. ""Don't die! Works every time."" The happy exchange segues nicely into her speech, which is--crudely speaking--about how if Republicans have their way, people will die. ""A couple weeks ago,"" says Hochul, ""there was a law passed on Capitol Hill that turned back the clock to the 1960s. What it did was, it said no longer will our Medicare program be the way it is now. It ends Medicare as we know it. That's not me talkin'. That's the Wall Street Journal and all the major news sources."" Four days from Tuesday's special election, Democrats are trying to close this campaign with the attack they've loved since Rep. Paul Ryan introduced his ""Path to Prosperity"" in April. The election is a choice: Vote for the Democrat and save Medicare, or vote for the Republican and start dismantling it for spare parts. It has the makings of a totally issue-based election. And this campaign is basically free of personal attacks and character attacks. But that's not to say there has been an ideological debate over Medicare or entitlement spending. The Republican, Jane Corwin, answers the Medicare attack by saying no, seriously, she'll work twice as hard to make sure it survives. The first election since the Ryan plan passed the House isn't really a fight over the Ryan plan. It's about which candidate loves Medicare more--or more accurately, about how the other candidate loves it less. The Democratic message is the easier sell, and Hochul is good at selling it. She's a local politician who rose through the ranks to become the clerk of Erie County, home to a nice plurality of voters in the 26th district. She's risen to that level while sounding exactly the way most of the people here sound, with a flat western New York accent and sentences that play some havoc with clauses and tenses. ""What it does,"" she continues, ""is instead of having guaranteed health insurance, like we've all come to rely on the last 45 years, it says you'll have a voucher, instead. Now, they're saying: Don't worry, seniors! It's not going to affect you. It's only the people my age, 55 and up. But they actually did something that made your prescription drugs cost more. Current seniors would actually pay more for prescription drugs, and future seniors--and I hope to be a senior someday myself--will have a voucher program. I've gotta tell ya, I'm the candidate in this race who's gonna look out for your interests."" She wraps up and gets polite applause. She's won over the room, a little. There's one older lady who's murmuring about how she wants to keep watching the documentary about Mexico that Hochul interrupted. There's more applause. Hank Janicki, who will later tell me he's a World War II veteran who was relieved at the end ""because Truman saved us,"" raises his hand. How does Hochul save Medicare? ""We have problems in Washington,"" says Hochul. ""We have to cut our expenses."" For example: ""You know how much money we give a year to Pakistan? About $3 billion a year! They're not exactly our friends these days. You know where they caught Bin Laden? Yeah, right in the middle of Pakistan! The downtown area, practically. You're right, sir. I think their priorities are wrong. They're worrying about Pakistan and giving the people who had more some tax breaks."" I ask Janicki what he thought of the answer. ""Eh,"" he says, ""it was an answer."" He's not excited. The Pakistan stuff came out of nowhere. Still, he's for Hochul now. Hochul bangs this same drum wherever she goes. After she meets voters at a nearby Greek restaurant, I try to nail her down on how, exactly, she thinks Medicare can be kept in its current form into the indefinite future. For example, in her crusade to save the system, she opposes the $500 billion in savings that were part of the Affordable Care Act. Those savings were weaponized in Republican ads in 2010, but according to the Medicare actuary they keep the system alive an extra eight years. Why scrap them? ""I think we've got to make sure that it doesn't trickle down to hurt any of the beneficiaries,"" she says, ""and I'm not confident of that."" This doesn't sound much like a debate about entitlements in Washington. There is no talk here of ""shared sacrifice."" There's the luxury of campaign-speak, where everything good can be preserved forever. That's how Jane Corwin sells the Ryan plan. Later the same day, Corwin arrives at a Republican dinner in Clarence, another Buffalo suburb. A thin crowd has barely dented the immense supply of pasta and cannoli and gooey peanut-butter treats while talking about a race they think they're winning. ""A lot of those Jack Davis votes are going to come home,"" explains Ray Walter, a local legislator, referring to the Tea Party candidate in the race. ""Hochul's got the views of 30 percent or so of the people in the district, so she'll win that, and that's it."" Key to keeping the Hochul vote down: convincing voters that she's lying her head off about Medicare. Corwin arrives and makes the rounds, joking and reminiscing. In the final debate this week, she was a little stiffer than Hochul. Her attack lines were worn with use--it was hard to count how many times she called the Democrat a ""career politician."" In person, she's much more affable, quick with facts and anecdotes. And even in a room of Republicans, she is asking for help convincing voters that she wants to save a linchpin of the Great Society. ""Just for the record, I am not decimating Medicare!"" Oh! Thank God! ""On the contrary, I am the one who's trying to save Medicare! It's President Obama and the Medicare Board of Trustees who say if we do nothing, the system will be bankrupt by 2024. When you go out there, do me a favor and tell your friends: Jane is saving Medicare, not decimating."" In an interview after the event, Corwin says she thinks she's identified how the race became about Medicare. ""When the Ryan plan came out,"" she says, ""the national Democrats came down on this 'Oh, you're decimating Medicare!' message. They just sent it down to my opponent and let her run with it."" But Corwin doesn't support keeping Medicare around in its current form. She supports turning it all into Medicare Part D. She gets some of the questions voters have asked, like: In this new Utopia of free-market plans, why exactly do insurers pick up, and not ignore, seniors with pre-existing conditions? ""Certainly I'd like to see pre-existing conditions and children staying on their parents' plans,"" she says. If Corwin wins this district next Tuesday, after all the attention paid to the race, Republicans will offer her victory as proof that Republicans can endorse the Ryan plan and survive. That'd be too simplistic. If Corwin wins, it will be because the district has a seven-point registration advantage for Republicans over Democrats--and because she didn't so much defend the Ryan plan as defend Medicare, and she did so by accusing her Democratic foe of defending it with lesser passion. ""She said it's all on the table,"" says Corwin, defending her much-attacked, omnipresent ad in which Hochul is portrayed as an entitlement-cutter in disguise. ""In the context she said it, it sounded like cuts to me. She doesn't want to take a position because it would be politically difficult to do that."""

19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/05/newtered.html	"Republicans are upset that Newt Gingrich used the word ""radical"" to describe House budget Chairman Paul Ryan's Medicare plan. But wasn't radical the whole point of Ryan's plan? It's the P90X of plans--something extreme to boast about. Radical was the promise of the Republicans who are now in charge of the House. Tea Party patriots didn't elect them to be timid. Never mind, though, you're not allowed to use the word radical. It has negative connotations. Who helped radicalize the word radical? Newt Gingrich. In a 1996 memo to members of GOPAC--the political farm team he created and nurtured to grow a new conservative majority--Gingrich lists it among those ""powerful words"" candidates should use to ""create a clear and easily understood contrast."" It's one of his favorites. In a speech last year, for example, he used seven different variations of the word to describe Obama and Democratic perfidies (a word not on the Gingrich list but used occasionally by the literati). Gingrich also said the Ryan plan was ""right-wing social engineering,"" a phrase not on the GOPAC list but also not so nice to say about members of your own party. The backlash from conservatives has been withering, and Gingrich has been in frantic damage control, calling Ryan to apologize and taking to the airwaves to explain himself. What's surprising is not that this is happening. Few in Republican politics think Gingrich has a chance to be nominated for president, much less elected. What's surprising is how quickly Republicans have gone from seeing Gingrich as a welcome addition to the presidential conversation to a pariah who must be exorcised before Labor Day. (After his next interview, they may move the date to Memorial Day.) In the GOPAC memo Gingrich heralds another GOPAC product titled ""Language Matters,"" an instructional tape created to help candidates hone their political skills: ""As the tapes have been used in training sessions across the country and mailed to candidates we have heard a plaintive plea, 'I wish I could speak like Newt.' That takes years of practice. But, we believe that you could have a significant impact on your campaign and the way you communicate if we help a little."" Sure, go ahead and laugh. But this memo and the countless millions of memos Gingrich sent over the years helped to build his reputation as an ideas man. It also helped build the modern Republican Party. Even Republicans who were on rival campaigns or held a dim view of his chances have said his candidacy is good for the party. He is the ideas candidate. He will help sharpen the other candidates' arguments. He will beat up on President Obama in an effective way. That's over. Now the plaintive plea coming from conservatives is that Gingrich stop speaking entirely. The Wall Street Journal called him a political opportunist. The Club for Growth suggested he should be in another party. South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said he ""cut [Ryan] off at the knees."" On redstate.com, Tabitha Hale wrote that it wasn't the first time he'd undermined the party. A random voter in Iowa even confronted Gingrich. (Mitt Romney must be relieved; last week he was the one in the GOP elite penalty box.) The criticism is not about whether Gingrich should or could be president. It's that he is a malevolent force that will imperil the chances of other candidates and the larger Republican experiment. He threatens the House Republican negotiations with the White House by giving Democrats a way to attack the GOP as too extreme. (As if on cue, Sen. Chuck Schumer did just that, saying, ""I couldn't agree more"" with Gingrich's assessment of the Ryan plan.) Alex Castellanos, a Republican media consultant, suggested that Gingrich provided just the kind of Republican caricature that offers Obama the best possible chance of victory. Castellanos knows whereof he speaks; he worked for Bob Dole in 1996, when a previous president used Gingrich to taint the GOP presidential candidate. Perhaps this outcome was to be expected, and not just because Gingrich is famously undisciplined. An ideas candidate is going to have actual ideas and say them out loud. Perhaps the expectation was that Gingrich was going to have only helpful or harmless ideas. No one would expect a presidential candidate to say anything more abrasive than a Snuggie. Anything else would be too radical. Become a fan of  John Dickerson  on Facebook."	"Newt Gingrich on Medicare: Too ""radical"" even for Republicans."

20	20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/05/huckless.html	"Mike Huckabee has decided what sort of campaign the 2012 Republican presidential candidates are going to have. Voters with well-worn copies of Joel Osteen and Tim LaHaye books on their nightstands, or degrees from Patrick Henry College on their ego walls, no longer have a favorite son. Voters who Tivo Rick Santelli's CNBC hits or tote ""Who Is John Galt?"" signs at Tea Parties no longer have a candidate they truly hate or fear. The men (and one or two women) who are actually running for president have just been spared a bitter opponent, a man who can hardly type the name ""Mitt Romney"" without flinging his keyboard out the window. That doesn't necessarily mean Saturday was a good night for Mitt Romney. A year from now, in fact, we may look back on May 14 as the night Tim Pawlenty won the GOP presidential nomination. In 2008, Huckabee clobbered Romney in Iowa, after being outspent 20-1, largely because church leaders in the state climbed over one another to endorse and help out this ordained Southern Baptist minister. But Huckabee's support and organization in some other states was negligible. ""Both of his New Hampshire supporters must be very disappointed,"" joked Fergus Cullen, the former GOP chairman in that state, who ran the party in the 2008 primary cycle. Huckabee's support in Iowa this year has been in the high teens or mid-20s in polls. It's now free to scatter. Ryan Rhodes, a key leader of Iowa's Tea Party movement, told me on Sunday that Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain had the most to gain. Pawlenty starts off in a better position than either. He's a Baptist who happened to be married by a minister who went on to lead the National Association of Evangelicals. He's already hired one of the men who pulled off Huckabee's 2008 win. With Huckabee in the race, it might have been tough for Pawlenty to pry evangelicals away. That's not a problem any more. But there's more to the GOP primary than Iowa. There are debates, and news cycles, and heated tiffs between candidates. Huckabee's not going to be part of this.  Forget about the wild world of evangelical politics and whether the next president thinks the age of planet Earth is better determined from radiometric dating than from Bible-reading. * Without Huckabee, this race actually shifts further to the right. That's because Huckabee is (or was) the last Republican with real national political pull who didn't believe in economic conservative orthodoxy. He believes in an activist government. He favored a smoking ban in Arkansas, and for a while he favored expanding it to all 50 states. He's OK with Michelle Obama running an anti-obesity campaign from the White House. (Bachmann said the first lady was implementing a ""nanny state,"" and most conservative voters agree with her.) If that seems like a minor spat, it wasn't--it comes out of Huckabee's philosophy about what government should do. In December 2007 and January 2008, he feuded with Rush Limbaugh, who said Huckabee was simply ""not a conservative"" given his views of what government was good for. In March 2008, after it was extra-clear that he wouldn't be the party's nominee, Huckabee started spelling this out. ""The greatest threat to classic Republicanism is not liberalism,"" he told reporter Will Mari. ""It's this new brand of libertarianism, which is social liberalism and economic conservatism, but it's a heartless, callous, soulless type of economic conservatism because it says, 'Look, we want to cut taxes and eliminate government. If it means that elderly people don't get their Medicare drugs, so be it. If it means little kids go without education and health care, so be it.' "" Huckabee was mocking what orthodox conservatives think. They struggle mightily to explain that this is good government, good economics, not heartless--teach a man to fish, give him a tax cut, and send him on his way. Liberals say it's heartless. And Huckabee sided with the liberals on this one. That's what made Rush so angry. ""That might be a, quote, 'pure economic conservative message,' but it's not an American message,"" he told Mari. ""It doesn't fly. People aren't going to buy that, because that's not the way we are as a people. That's not historic Republicanism. Historic Republicanism does not hate government; it's just there to be as little of it as there can be. But they also recognize that government has to be paid for."" This wasn't just one vinegary interview conducted as the party called for him to leave the race. This was a salvo in a war between Huckabee and conservatives personified by the Club for Growth, which had attacked him relentlessly over his Arkansas record. In his memoir  Do the Right Thing, published right after the November election, Huckabee warned that libertarians were hijacking the GOP. ""The libertarian faux-cons have helped to drive the party even further away from its base of the hard-working middle class,"" he wrote. And he kept on saying that, even and especially when libertarians, via the Tea Party movement, took a leading role in the GOP. He skipped the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2010 because it had become ""increasingly more libertarian and less Republican over the last years."" What about Huckabee and the Tea Party, anyway? He never headlined a Tea Party event, but he praised the movement. Two months ago, the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll revealed that a plurality of voters who identified with the Tea Party would vote for him. But the Tea Party is vast; it contains multitudes. Huckabee's Tea Party fans aren't libertarians. They're the people who chanted, ""Keep your government hands off my Medicare!"" They're the ones who are making life trickier for Rep. Paul Ryan right now because they want to bring spending under control but don't want to cut entitlements. And now they don't have a candidate. They might not have had a candidate even if Huckabee had run. In the last campaign's debates, when asked about tax policy, he'd effectively punt and remind people that he wanted to demolish the IRS and institute a national consumption tax. At the first South Carolina debate, Huckabee implied that he'd only raised taxes because Democrats and voters had forced him to. Things had changed since then. Huckabee was more popular. His party had drifted further from him on economics. There was a way for Huckabee to challenge that. He didn't take it. He listened to his heart. Correction,  May 17, 2011: This article originally implied that the age of Earth could be ascertained using carbon dating. It is radiometric dating that reveals the age of the planet.

21	21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/05/meanwhile_in_libya_.html	"On Thursday morning, the Obama administration was supposed to finally report to the Senate on progress in the campaign against Muammar Qaddafi's Libya, which began March 19. Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg took a chair in the foreign relations committee hearing room. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, was ready with questions: --The 60-day deadline for Congress to pass a bill authorizing the intervention, a provision of the War Powers Resolution, was coming up. ""Does President Obama plan to ask Congress for such a resolution?"" --NATO hadn't yet said whether there was a terrorist presence in the Libyan opposition. ""What additional information have you seen to support the assertion that there is not a significant al-Qaida or terrorist presence in the Libyan Interim Transitional National Council?"" --The rebels seemed to have lost momentum since mid-April. ""Can Libyan TNC forces prevail against pro-Qaddafi forces without an augmented participation of NATO? Could NATO continue this mission without the participation of the United States?"" These were Lee's questions. He didn't get to ask them. The hearing lasted a little less than an hour, and only five senators had time to quiz Steinberg. Before they started, Chairman John Kerry, D-Mass., apologized; the senators were ""under the gun"" with meetings at the White House, where the drama over the debt ceiling vote was playing out. There was nothing new there. Two and a half months since the Libyan civil war broke out, and coming up on two months since the start of Operation Odyssey Dawn, Congress is at something of a loss. Republicans are very unhappy about the lack of information they're getting. Democrats are merely unhappy. Unless something changes very quickly, the resolution that Lee mentioned will be, in Kerry's words, ""in limbo."" Limbo is taking on a lot of new residents. Democrats and Republicans who back the White House are not obsessing over the War Powers Act. Yes, they want to know what happens if Qaddafi goes. After Osama Bin Laden was killed, though, all of this faded into the background. ""I'm not looking, necessarily, at this point in time, for an additional vote,"" said Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., the Democrats' House whip. Critics of the intervention--many of them are critics of the way it was handled, not the goal--don't expect a vote. They're worried about precedent; they're worried about what happens next, even and especially if the rebels win. ""I think we've been muddling through this,"" said Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., one of the key progressives in the House. ""I think we need something definitive about the administration and what their policy is in Libya. I think if there was a resolution, it would be hard pressed to pass."" At the hearing on Thursday, Kerry gave reason after reason to be optimistic that the whole ""congressional authorization"" discussion might not matter. ""The situation in Libya,"" he said, ""which appears to be significantly stalemated, I think is different than it appears."" Rebels claimed to have secured the city of Misrata and pushed away Qaddafi's forces. ""We're back closer--not exactly where we were--but closer to where we were at the start, when this swept the whole country."" Steinberg echoed some of that optimism, albeit very carefully. He stressed something that answered worries about both how long the conflict would last and whether Congress had to pass a resolution of its own. ""The very substantial majority of operations are being conducted by coalition partners,"" he said. ""We have reduced our role to primarily a support role. In cases where we have unique assets, they're being made available."" The implication: This intervention in Libya might not need a vote in Congress. NATO has taken the lead on it; America's role is mostly supportive, paid for out of the defense budget. All is well. Republicans don't want to hear it. Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., the ranking member of the committee, had criticized the lack of communication between the White House and Congress since the start of the intervention. Lugar had been seen--accurately--as a foreign policy mentor to Obama when the future president was a senator. That was a long time ago. ""We're moving rapidly down the trail,"" Lugar told Steinberg, ""in a situation where we haven't declared war, the War Powers Act hasn't been observed, we have no particular authority for any of this aside from the president's assertion that we needed to save lives. We have already pumped the missiles into Libya, at some expense. The meter is still running on our expenditures and our defense budget without much accounting for how much can be attributable to Libya or how far we have to go."" Steinberg nodded: ""We provided notification to Congress consistent with the War Powers Act at the outset of the operation. As we continue to move forward, the president is committed to do that."" Sen. Bob Corker, the compromise-minded Republican from Tennessee, was the only other member of Lugar's party who quizzed Steinberg. ""You use the word consultation,"" he said, ""but there really isn't any consultation. It's a nice word to use. I know today we asked that someone from the military be here, and you declined. I think someone asked you earlier what assets we did have engaged, and you deferred to military. I would like to ask why, in the name of consultation, the administration has been so remiss in letting us know actually what we're doing as it relates to our military assets."" ""There are a number of forums where there are opportunities to explore these issues,"" said Steinberg. ""I think we need to explore how we can best get information to you."" ""Name the forum and I'll be there,"" said Corker. ""I'm not busy after 1 p.m. today, and I'll be around on Monday. Could you arrange to set it up and let us know what's happening?"" That broke the tension; Steinberg agreed. Corker wasn't done. ""This use of the word consultation is bogus,"" he said, ""and people like myself who cooperate with you in many ways, candidly, are getting a little impatient with the fact that basically you're waiting until this conflict is mostly over, possibly, to even let us know what's happening. I don't consider that consultation. Nor do I consider that something that creates goodwill. Nor do I consider that something that's going to cause us to work well together in the future."" The hearing wrapped up not long thereafter. On the way out, as he was heading to the White House, Lugar confirmed that he still wanted a resolution. He still wasn't satisfied with the contact between Congress and the White House. ""We made clear our desire to have that consultation,"" he shrugged. He pushed an elevator button and sped away."

22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/05/one_hundred_percent_pure_romney.html	"Mitt Romney is no doctor, but on Thursday he appeared at the University of Michigan's Cardiovascular Center in an attempt to perform the first live separation of conjoined twins: Mitt Romney the presidential candidate and Mitt Romney the Massachusetts governor. In a speech that included PowerPoint slides, Romney explained why he was proud of the health care plan he passed in Massachusetts--but also why it would be wrong for the entire country. It is a difficult procedure. The policy terrain is a complex, requiring the use of terms such as free riders, co-insurance, and purchasing alliances. But the political terrain may be even more complicated. Romney was trying to fix a political problem that dogged his last campaign: the view among some voters that he lacks a core, that he bends too easily to the political winds. In 2008, the so-called authenticity problem dogged him over his switchback positions on social issues such as abortion. Now it's health care. Where does the Mitt Romney who signed health care reform in Massachusetts with an individual mandate end, and where does the one denouncing President Obama's health care reform with an individual mandate begin? On Thursday, Romney made several claims for his authenticity. He said people had encouraged him to run away from his record as governor but that he would not. ""It wouldn't be honest,"" Romney said. ""I did what I believed was right for the people of my state."" Later, as he laid out his national plan, he said it was like the one he proposed in 2008. ""I am not adjusting the plan to reflect the political sentiment."" The authenticity injection will be a monumental task for Romney. This conclusion does not require any grand judgments about the details of his health care plan or his genuineness. It simply requires a look at his daily schedule. To be a presidential candidate is to spend your day--morning to dusk--engaged in activities that are inauthentic. Searching for authenticity in politics is like looking for butter in margarine. Yet as we head into a presidential year, journalists and voters once again will take bread in hand, spread on the counterfeit, and wonder why it doesn't taste fresh. Not all authenticity is the same, of course. Voters seem to tolerate a certain amount of situational inauthenticity. (If they didn't, we wouldn't have politicians.) But emotional authenticity--what you're ""really"" like as a person--or intellectual authenticity--what you really believe in--matter a lot more to voters. The problem is that if voters have doubts about those kinds of authenticity, there are few instances in which a candidate can give voters a window into those areas to reassure them. There just aren't that many opportunities, because the day-to-day act of politics is so inauthentic. The job of a politician is to be inauthentic in rooms with people from whom you wish to collect moneyto get handed a sheet of names to thank people sincerely you've only just met. You must feign friendship and interest in local television hosts and even more mind-bending faux enthusiasm for the national television hosts whom you don't particularly like. You don't dare snub a long-winded or pushy voter. You cannot have a bad day in public for fear of a YouTube moment. You have to drink beverages and eat food you don't like. You hardly ever get to sleep in your own bed. It's very hard to come across as authentic when you are draped each day in all this hokum. Romney was at cross purposes a little Thursday. He spoke without a tie--which, at least since the secret plot known as Casual Friday was instituted--is supposed to convey a relaxed style. At the same time he used PowerPoint slides, which work against that clubhouse feeling. Substantively, Romney was also confusing. When Romney makes the case for what worked in Massachusetts, the uninitiated are likely to wonder why such a success shouldn't be a national model--like the one President Obama signed. Democratic spokesman Brad Woodhouse joked in a tweet to his colleague Hari Sevugan ""Romney is making a great case for national health reform. Book him on cable tonight?"" Romney invoked the principle of federalism, saying that governors have more leeway in many ways than presidents because states are the ""Laboratories of Democracy.""  But conservatives most likely to buy that argument have trouble with him for other reasons. They don't like that his Massachusetts plan included a mandate to force people to buy insurance. The speech was barely over before Rick Santorum issued a statement decrying ""both Romneycare and Obamacare"" because they ""infringe upon individual freedom."" Avik Roy writing in the National Review, said ""Mitt Romney just gave a more articulate defense of Obamacare than President Obama ever has."" The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, didn't even wait for the speech, publishing a full-throated attack on Romney and his health care plan on Thursday morning. All of this would make even the most confident fellow a little halting and nervous. That's what Romney looked like at times as he looked up at his Powerpoint slides from behind the lectern and made tentative jokes. It looked very authentic.

23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/05/the_empathy_trap.html	"Presidents must show empathy during difficult economic times. It's in the office handbook. There's only so much any one president can do though about the immediate condition of the economy, and he must be careful not to exaggerate his impact. So he emphasizes that he understands the plight of regular Americans. The problem with empathy, however, is not just that there's never enough of it to go around. It's that by offering it, presidents raise unrealistic expectations of a different sort. The empathy tactic is most associated with Bill Clinton, who famously said, ""I feel your pain"" during the 1992 campaign, but the phrase actually dates to Jimmy Carter, who promised to be ""a president who's not isolated from the people, but who feels your pain,"" in the 1976 campaign. Even John Kennedy shot a superbly stiff commercial where he plunked himself on the sofa like an insurance salesman to chat with a regular American family. The master was FDR, whose polio helped him convey a heartfelt connection with those struggling through the Depression. So on Wednesday, when President Obama participated in a CBS News town hall meeting devoted to the economy, he wore his empathy like the flag pin on his collar. ""A lot of folks are still anxious about the fact that even if they have a job, even if they're working really hard, that their wages haven't gone up, their incomes haven't gone up, but the costs of everything from gas to groceries to health care to a college education, those have all gone up. ... People just feel like the American dream, the core notion that if you work hard and you act responsibly that you can pass on a better life to your kids and your grandkids--a lot of folks aren't feeling that anymore."" Obama's approval ratings on the economy are high in one poll, but at their lowest level ever in three national polls. He's passed a stimulus, bailed out car companies, and promoted a host of other economic measures; but at this point GOP opposition, the deficit, and politics mean his options on the economy are limited. So he's bringing on the empathy. But showing empathy comes with its own risks (and not just the risk that it will not seem genuine, as George H.W. Bush discovered with his ""Message: I care"" attempt in 1992). The risk of empathy is that it pushes a president into roles he's not really suited to play: job counselor, psychotherapist, loan officer. At Wednesday's discussion, Karen Gallo, a former employee at the National Zoo, asked the president the second question. Seven months pregnant, she is out of work and terrified. ""I definitely need a job,"" she said. ""I just wonder what would you do, if you were me?"" Obama did what presidents are supposed to do: He congratulated her on the impending birth. He bucked her up a little. He asked her about her situation. There wasn't much he could do in terms of job counseling, so he made a larger point about how government workers like Karen are people, too. ""When we have discussions about how to cut our debt and our deficit in an intelligent way, we have to make sure that we understand this is not just a matter of numbers, these are people."" She liked his answer. Afterward, I quizzed the audience  along with Jill Schlesinger of CBS Moneywatch.com. ""He is the leader of the free world,"" she said, ""so I was happy to hear that he wanted to help me or at least wanted to hear about my situation."" Faced with Karen and her plight--and the human desire to not crush someone in a vulnerable moment--the president told her what she wanted to hear. When he was asked if an improvement in the economy would bring her job back, the president said, ""I hope so."" Given the spending reduction derby in Washington, which is likely to cut more government jobs, and the size of the deficit, the president's answer was wishful thinking. The audience knew it. I asked them afterward to raise their hands if anyone shared the president's optimism that the job would come back. One hand went up and then down. Next came Nancy Logan. She had faithfully paid her mortgage after her loan was modified, but now her bank wasn't extending the terms. Her official question was what the president was going to do to keep families like hers from losing their homes. The president quizzed her on her circumstances, showing concern the way he was supposed to, but that led to an inevitable conclusion. ""Maybe you can make a call,"" she said half-jokingly. It was an almost perfect illustration of the empathy trap. The empathy trap also works in a more abstract way. Peter Baca asked the president what he could do to lower gas prices. The president explained the conditions that had caused higher prices (an improving economy that had pushed up demand and unrest in the Middle East) and outlined his long-term plans. I asked Baca whether he felt the president had answered his question. ""No, unfortunately he didn't,"" he said. ""I go to the gas station once a week. When he took office the average price of gasoline was $1.87, now the average price is close to $5. ... It's outrageous. ... I would have liked to have heard him talk a little more about offshore drilling and what we can do here in the United States."" The sentiment that seemed to get the most emotional response afterward was the president's contention that American businesses are not doing enough to hire people. ""When we're in the middle of a recession, our whole job was to make sure the--the economy was still growing and we stabilized the financial system. And we did that. And American taxpayers contributed to that process of stabilizing the economy. Companies have benefited from that, and they're making a lot of money. And now's the time for them to start betting on American workers and American products."" The best news for the president came from Richard Ross. When I asked the audience if anyone had been persuaded by what Obama had said in the previous hour, Ross spoke up. ""He does way better without a Teleprompter,"" said Ross, who described himself a conservative independent voter from Nashville. ""I hear all the time he needs a Teleprompter. I like his vision. I feel like he's in touch with a lot of things."" The White House would like to create more voters like Ross. Obama needs voters to think he's on the case. The challenge is vast, though. Whether at the gas pump, in the grocery aisles, or on their mortgage statements, people are constantly seeing scary numbers. To keep up with all that anxiety, the president-as-therapist would have to hold office hours every day. Become a fan of  John Dickerson on Facebook."

It's about how universal care had a demo in one of Canada's less populous provinces, where it proved so popular and successful that the rest of the country couldn't help but copy it. ""Saskatchewan was the first province in Canada to get universal health care,"" said Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., outside Capitol Hill on Tuesday. ""The most beloved Canadian is Tommy Douglas, who started it."" In the early 1960s, under Premier Tommy Douglas, the rural Canadian province introduced something like Medicare that covered everyone. Panic and protests ensued. The province had to import doctors temporarily to cover for the ones who'd gone on strike. But the plan worked. It was popular. By the end of the decade, all of Canada had the plan. And in 2004 Douglas was named the ""greatest Canadian"" in a poll, surging past Wayne Gretzky, Pierre Trudeau, and the bassist from The Tragically Hip. So that part's not hyperbole, either. McDermott was telling this story partly to explain why he hadn't just wasted his time. He and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., had just rolled out the latest version of their single-payer plan, the American Health Security Act (PDF). There was not much media present; there were no other members of Congress. Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., cast a quizzical look at the event as he passed by walking his dog. The first question to McDermott and Sanders was about why they thought they could pass single-payer health care in 2011 when it couldn't win enough votes even when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress in the last session. The answer: They didn't. But the state of Vermont will. On May 26, Gov. Peter Shumlin of Vermont is expected to sign legislation that will create universal coverage in the state--eventually. Vermont will use subsidies from the Affordable Care Act to help create a Canada-style system. And its system, or so the theory goes, will become so popular and cheap that the rest of America will want to copy it. ""Many of our Republican colleagues say they don't trust the federal government,"" said Sanders."	Universal health care in Vermont: Will it come to the rest of America?

25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/05/say_anything.html	"AIKEN, S.C.--Rick Santorum is early. That's a good move, because it's lunchtime and the space for his town hall meeting, at the West Side Bowery restaurant, is almost full. So he works the room, making small talk and taking questions. After a few conversations, Santorum picks up a water glass and clinks it with a butter knife. Time for a benediction from a local pastor. When the prayer wraps up, Santorum helps to unwrap the sandwiches. ""Let's go one table at a time--you guys, you go first."" Twenty-five people load up on cold cuts and potato chips so they can size up a potential commander-in-chief. This is the 16th trip Santorum has made to South Carolina since he started hinting that he might run for president. Seeing him in person inspires two immediate reactions: First, you understand why he isn't being taken seriously. Second, you question how fair that is. You go back and forth on which reaction makes sense, because on paper a Santorum campaign makes perfect sense. He couldn't win an election in 2006? Hey, Romney and Huckabee didn't even try to, and Romney probably would have lost. (In Aiken, Santorum even points out that Abraham Lincoln lost his U.S. Senate race against Stephen Douglas before getting elected president.) He's too conservative to win? Republicans just don't think that's true, and if you want to belabor the point, get ready to hear about Ronald Reagan's two landslides or all of the Republicans who blasted into office last year. ""'So you lost your election in 2006?'"" he tells the crowd, beating them to the punch with a rhetorical question. ""Yes I did. Because I didn't waver an inch in a climate where folks were running for the hills, and no one was running as a conservative. I went out and talked about how we needed to win the war in Iraq when people wanted to get out of Iraq. ... Jim DeMint, he'll tell you: Jim DeMint and I went to the floor and did structured debates with Democrats on how we needed to reform Social Security. ... It's one thing to do that when you're a senator from South Carolina, and it's another to do it when you're a senator from Pennsylvania."" What else can the skeptics say about Santorum? He doesn't have connections or money? Neither did Huckabee, for a good long while, as he gathered momentum. (Although he did encourage the FairTax campaign to adopt him, and he got plenty of juice from their organizers.) He doesn't poll well? Nobody polls well against President Obama, except for Huckabee, who may not run, and Romney, who they haven't seen in South Carolina once in a year. Meanwhile, they've seen Santorum 16 times. So what do they see? The Rick Santorum show is a continuation of the campaign that ended on Election Day in Pennsylvania in 2006. Santorum knows why he lost, but his anger at the unfairness of the loss simmers like radiation whenever he starts to answer a question. He seems to have constructed a palace of memory in which every pundit's slight against him is remembered. In Aiken, he reargues his answer to Fox News debate moderators on whether he thinks women should stay out of the workplace. (He doesn't.) He reargues a point he's been making in several interviews,  including one last week with Slate's John Dickerson, that Obama's statements reveal he doesn't think America is great or exceptional. (In Aiken, all he needs to do to convince the crowd is point out that Obama said that ""America was not a great country"" until the growth of the welfare state.) Santorum's pitch is reductive. It assumes that his audience is angry that Republican candidates aren't passionate enough about explaining and defending what the party stands for. This makes a kind of sense. A Republican voter can watch Fox News, listen to talk radio, read the Drudge Report, and then listen to the people claiming to lead the party who don't seem nearly as worried as they do. Not so with Santorum. ""Why do you think the left wants to get your kids at two, three years of age?"" he asks. ""Why do they want early, early, early, early education? So they can get you quick! So they can convince you to just turn them over to them!"" These answers start to have their intended effect: Santorum seems reassuringly worried. So the crowd listens. ""The Democrats' argument against the Medicare reform is that seniors simply can't take care of [themselves],"" Santorum says. ""They say, 'You can't give seniors choices! You can't give seniors options! You can't have them make decisions and take responsibility. You've got to do this for them!' As if when you turn 65, your brain capacity goes away! My mother's 92! She got an iPad a couple months ago, OK, and she's whizzing away on an iPad!... Are there people who can't? Sure. But don't, don't structure a system for people on the margins who can't. Structure it for the rest of them, and help those who can't."" In the crowd are voters and local Republican leaders who have been courted by other candidates but haven't seen Santorum before. He's clearly winning them over and starting to disarm them. ""One of the stupidest questions they asked, I want to ask you,"" says one voter. Santorum's smile, which contains most of the essential elements of a grimace, is well-suited to this one. ""OK,"" he says. ""I assume it wasn't asked of me last night."" ""No, it was asked of ... what was his name ... the governor, [Gary] Johnson. If you were a reality show, what would you be?"" The candidate finds his footing only slighter faster than Johnson did. ""I don't really watch a lot of television. Certainly, being in our house and watching our family is something that ..."" Aha, he's come up with something. ""I would invite someone into our house, because we have a new addition, she's three, and she was born with a condition named trisomy 18, which means she was born with an extra 18th chromosome."" So Santorum goes into the story of his daughter, Isabella. He makes shapes with his hands to demonstrate the genetic and medical jargon he's talking about. The audience is transfixed. ""I know you've heard the term Down Syndrome,"" Santorum says. ""You probably know people who have Down Syndrome, too. That's trisomy 21. Down Syndrome is when a child is born with an extra 21st chromosome. That all happens at conception. What happens is, that chromosome pair that is responsible for the blueprint of your body, you're supposed to have two. In this case, this cell has three. As a result of that you get all sorts of mixed genetic messages, and things don't always work. Believe it or not, it happens--these trisomy disorders happen fairly frequently. And if you're a 13 or a 21 you can survive. If you're a trisomy anything else, you may not. Isabella was not supposed to survive. She's a miracle."" Santorum goes on at length about this. That's his answer to a potential softball question: a lecture/sermon about disabilities and the miracle of life. The crowd leaves impressed; the woman who asked about Medicare writes Santorum a check for $35. Later, he'll appear at the state GOP's Silver Elephant Dinner in Columbia, and because every other candidate declined to accept an invitation, he'll get to give a long version of his speech to a captive crowd. Only a couple of people leave before he's done. The people who stay give him a standing ovation. ""I like him,"" says Dean Allen, a mutton-chopped Tea Party activist from Greenville. ""I don't think we need to wait for anyone else. They're retreads."" Republicans participate in a straw poll after the dinner's over. Four hundred and eight of them cast ballots before heading into the warm night. Santorum wins in a walk."	Rick Santorum 2012: He's telling Republicans he's as angry as they are.

26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/05/the_bin_laden_bump.html	"The operation that killed Osama Bin Laden has improved President Obama's poll numbers. In the CBS/New York Times poll released Wednesday morning, the president's approval rating jumped 11 points from the previous month. In the Washington Post/Pew poll released Tuesday and taken after Obama announced Bin Laden's death, his approval rating shot up nine points. Now if the president could only order a commando strike to bring down gas prices. What's notable in these polls is not so much that Obama's numbers have improved. It's that, on the all-important question of handling the economy, he saw no improvement at all. When people feel good about a president, that goodwill can bleed over to their feelings about his handling of other issues that aren't related to the underlying event. When Saddam Hussein was captured in December 2003, George W. Bush saw a similar increase in his approval rating to the one Obama does now--but he also saw improvement in his approval rating on the issue of the economy. In a CBS poll, his approval on that score increased five points, to 49 percent. (Bush's numbers would later fall.) Obama's numbers on the economy have been flat or declining. In the Post poll, only 40 percent approved of his handling of the economy, unchanged from the previous survey in late April. In the CBS poll, 34 percent of the country approved of Obama's handling of the economy, down from 38 percent just a week ago. That's the president's lowest rating on the issue since coming into office. George  W. Bush benefited from a different economic climate. In December 2004, Americans were concerned about the economy but their mood was improving. * Fifty-five percent of the country said the economy was doing well, up five percentage points from the previous month and 10 points since that summer. People are in a funk right now. In an April 21 CBS poll, the share of Americans who believe the economy was getting worse increased by 13 points. In that survey, 80 percent of those polled said the economy was ""fairly bad"" or ""very bad."" Gas prices, which White House advisers blame for the shift, have increased 37 percent in the last year. The way people feel about the president's handling of the economy will probably be the most important factor in his re-election. In this context a lot of people mention George H.W. Bush's plummeting poll numbers. His approval rating was 89 percent just after the end of the Gulf War, but by election time, it was below 40 percent. The good news for Obama and his supporters is that as bad as the president's numbers are on the economy, Americans still trust him to handle the economy more than they trust Republican leaders. In a recent Gallup poll Americans' confidence in Obama's ability to do the right thing for the U.S. economy is down to 50 percent from 54 percent a year ago and 71 percent in 2009. But that's still higher than the 44 percent of those surveyed who have confidence in congressional Republicans. If Republicans want to turn Obama into another George H.W. Bush, they will have to find a candidate who can take advantage of the economic situation the way Bill Clinton did. They're all trying, but so far none have broken through. ""Job Creation Must Be Job One,"" reads an email this morning from Newt Gingrich to supporters. Mitt Romney, campaigning in New Hampshire, stressed that the enduring issue of the presidential race is the economy. Yet neither appears to be making much headway. While the president's approval rating will almost certainly fall in the next 18 months, there is one probable enduring benefit to the Bin Laden operation. The president may now have a sturdier floor for his poll numbers. It is now much harder for Republicans to make the claim that Obama is not focused on the terrorist threat or the broader claim that when it comes to protecting America's interests, he can't take action. The president's opponents had made inroads on these issues. Last month, a Gallup Poll found only 52 percent of respondents thought he was a ""strong decision-maker""--the lowest rating of his presidency. Last week, the president's campaign sent an email to supporters entitled ""Big Things."" The message was that the president had taken on challenges that had bedeviled his predecessors. The email predates the Bin Laden operation, but reading it now, Obama supporters may be reminded that Bill Clinton tried to kill Bin Laden, and so did George Bush. Yet Bin Laden remained hidden for 10 years after the attacks on 9/11. With constant focus and patience, Obama did what his predecessors could not. If the president can sell the country that message on the economy, perhaps his numbers will improve on that issue, too. Become a fan of  John Dickerson  on Facebook.

27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/05/the_new_new_normal.html	"The killing of Osama Bin Laden has done something miraculous: It has proved everyone in Washington right. Did you think the war in Afghanistan was a waste of effort, or did you think it was the right war at the right time? Did you defend George W. Bush's interrogation policies, or did you raise a glass when Barack Obama ended them? Whatever you were saying, you were dead on. Take two examples from the past 24 hours. ""This idea--we caught Bin Laden because of waterboarding--I think is a misstatement,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., to reporters on Tuesday. ""This whole concept of how we caught Bin Laden is a lot of work over time by different people, and putting a puzzle together."" He emphasized it again. ""I do not believe this is a time to celebrate waterboarding. I believe this is a time to celebrate hard work."" This was not what Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., had been saying a day earlier.""We obtained that information through waterboarding,"" the chairman of the House Homeland Security told Bill O'Reilly. ""So for those who say that waterboarding doesn't work, who say it should be stopped and never used again, we got vital information which directly led us to Bin Laden."" Washington has just seen Obama approve a successful, extra-sovereign hit on the head of al-Qaida. What does that do to two years--more than that, if you go back to the campaign--of the hawks' consensus that Obama's feckless war-on-terror strategy can't possibly work? How does it change the way the war on terror is conducted? The capture of Bin Laden is a rare thing: an event that inspires victory celebrations in the streets, without the sort of changes that usually come after a victory. Start with waterboarding and ""enhanced interrogations."" Supporters of the old Bush policy started spinning the Bin Laden capture as a validation pretty soon after the news broke. ""It's an enhanced interrogation program that we put in place back in our first term,"" former Vice President Dick Cheney told ABC News. ""It wouldn't be surprising if in fact that program produced results that ultimately contributed to the success of this venture."" And on Tuesday night, pressed by Brian Williams, Leon Panetta confirmed that some of the information that led to Bin Laden--a manhunt that stretched over a decade--was gleaned from ""enhanced interrogation techniques."" How might this have worked? On March 1, 2003, Khalid Sheikh Muhammad was captured. He was interrogated, but according to a report declassified in 2009, he was a fount of mostly useless information until he was broken by 183 waterboardings and more than a week of sleep deprivation. After that, he was pliable. And according to the Associated Press, it was KSM who provided the nickname that eventually allowed the United States to locate Osama Bin Laden's courier. Did the information come because KSM was waterboarded, or could you say that KSM was waterboarded at one point in time, and he provided key information at another point in time? There's just enough fog there to allow everyone to walk out of this with a fact he or she likes. On Tuesday, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein repeatedly told reporters that the information that led to Bin Laden did not come from enhanced interrogation. ""I happen to know a good deal about how those interrogations were conducted,"" said Feinstein. ""And in my mind, nothing justifies the procedures that were used."" Graham, who was one of the GOP's leading opponents of waterboarding throughout the Bush years, agreed with Feinstein--but not entirely. After criticizing waterboarding and agreeing that ""problems at Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib caused us great misery"" as recruiting tools, he suggested that the outcome in Abbottabad was a validation of what he'd been saying all along, as when he'd warned the Obama White House not to ban any other interrogation techniques that were not in the military field manual. ""The best way to get information from people is to hold them and get a rapport with them,"" he said. ""I believed in enhanced interrogation techniques being classified. [Now] they're off the table. Big mistake."" The point: Everyone is still dug in. Bin Laden's death was satisfying, clarifying--and it may not change much about the permanent war on terror that began on 9/11. In the wake of the news, the FBI updated its ""Most Wanted"" list and went on ""war footing."" With the exception of the debate over Afghanistan and Pakistan funding--where the supporters of the status quo greatly outnumber the critics who think we can ""declare victory and go home""--the discussion in Washington since then has been about how Bin Laden's death can validate the policies already in effect. Asked about that on Tuesday, Graham said that the death of Bin Laden was an opportunity to step up the effort in Afghanistan. Later, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman John Kerry confronted critics who want to punish Pakistan by cutting its aid. ""If you want a radical Islamic government having possession of nuclear weapons and running Pakistan,"" said Kerry, ""then you can go off in a kneejerk way that makes matters worse. I'm not for making matters worse."" That was clear on Tuesday in discussions of a priority that's been mostly ignored as Congress has debated debt ceilings and how best to repeal all of Nancy Pelosi's works. Some provisions of the Patriot Act will sunset this month. There's no serious partisan disagreement over extending them. Speaking before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, Attorney General Eric Holder proved it. ""We will continue to utilize the critical authorities provided under the provisions of the Patriot Act,"" said Holder, ""which I hope Congress will move promptly to reauthorize for a substantial period of time."" Later in the day, Mitch McConnell was asked what, if anything, the killing of Bin Laden would do for the Patriot debate. ""Most of us believe it's been an effective tool in the war on terror,"" said McConnell. ""There's some evidence that some of those tools may have been helpful [in getting Bin Laden]. I hope if it has any impact at all, it will be in the direction of extending the current provisions."""

28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/05/all_work_and_no_play.html	"Ever had something really important on your mind that you couldn't shake no matter what you were doing? You put the butter in the kitchen drawer instead of the fridge because you were replaying the meeting you had with your boss that morning or stay stopped after the light turned green because you're thinking about that presentation tomorrow. Imagine, then, what it would be like to be President Obama holding the operation to kill Osama Bin Laden in your head while trying to go about your day. In the timeline of the Bin Laden operation, we see just how closely the secret life of a president bumps against his public life. Though this operation was a special case, it puts in high relief an oft-forgotten truth about the presidency: The president is occupied by a lot more than the public can see. This would seem obvious, but it gets lost in the endless assessments of whether the president is ""showing leadership"" on any given topic. Much of that coverage assumes a president with more time than he actually has, buffeted only by the facts we know. During the period of intense focus on Bin Laden, other problems and issues the president was dealing with included: a government shutdown, a big speech on the budget, the start of his presidential campaign, the birth-certificate follies, and the bombing of Libya. Oh, and trying to ""win the future."" The presidency distorts the brain like perhaps no other job on Earth. In the First Noggin, there must be many compartments locked double tight, so the president doesn't show anything on his face. Sometimes he must keep secrets even from the people who work down the hall. But each box has to be accessible immediately if a decision needs to be made. Sometimes the contents of these boxes are difficult and profound questions about life and death. Other times, they concern merely a president's political fortunes--which appeals to the ego, making them perhaps even more difficult to control. And all the while, there are legions of journalists and opponents trying to pry open these little boxes through force, shame, and flattery. The most acute recent moments of compartmentalization for Obama had to have been Friday and Saturday. On Friday he gave the final order and then flew to Alabama to visit with families ravaged by the recent tornado. He ended the day in Florida visiting with Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and her astronaut husband. On Saturday he attended the White House Correspondents' Association dinner, where he had to tell jokes and sit through a comedy routine during which everyone watched his every facial twitch for insights into his psyche. A president criticized for playing golf or spending time in Brazil on the eve of the Libyan invasion would have been relentlessly skewered for engaging in banter with the press on the eve of a dangerous military operation. But it wasn't just Saturday night that the president had to keep his serious brain cordoned off from his less serious brain. During the final phase of the multiyear operation, Obama chaired the National Security Council on five occasions to discuss progress. A look at those five days tells the story of not just how quickly a president must switch between his public and private duties but also how silly some of the public calls for his attention must have seemed to him at the time. March 14: The president attends Kenmore Middle School in Washington's Virginia suburbs and gives a speech about education policy. He meets with Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen of Denmark. In the late afternoon, he chairs the meeting on Bin Laden. Shortly thereafter, he attends a Democratic Party fundraising dinner. The news of the day is that the president and Republican leaders have agreed to a second stopgap measure to keep the government open and avoid a shutdown. March 19: The makeshift command center Obama used in Brazil is thought to be simply the place where he discusses Libya planning on the eve of U.S. operations. But it turns out Obama has been occupied with more than one military operation. The day's activities also include a diplomatic arrival ceremony, a press conference, public remarks, and a few receptions. April 12: The consuming story in Washington is the president's coming budget speech. Liberals who had been angry that Obama had not been a public presence in the budget fight with Republicans over extending government operations for the rest of the year are skeptical that Obama will deliver a forceful rebuttal to the House budget proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan. April 19: The president starts his day with an Easter Prayer Breakfast, then performs in a town hall with voters, followed by a meeting with various interested parties to discuss immigration. His official schedule ends with a meeting with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. April 28: The president announces his new national security team, meets with Hispanic leaders, and then meets with the president of Panama, with whom he delivers statements to the press. Of all the secrets President Obama has had to carry, the details of the Bin Laden operation was probably one of the biggest. He may have had a special delight in bringing it to the White House Correspondents' Association dinner, where much of the audience lives to publish a president's secrets before he can reveal them. A year earlier, as Obama spoke at the same dinner, the Times Square bomb plot was being foiled. Obama was informed of this shortly after he left the stage. The public wouldn't know for a few hours. Unlike the dinner, such crises are not an annual event. For a president, though, they happen every day. Become a fan of  John Dickerson  on Facebook."
