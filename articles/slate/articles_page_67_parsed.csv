Five years ago, the combative governor with plummeting approval ratings resigned from office after it turned out he was a regular customer of a high-end call girl service. On Sunday, he suddenly announced his candidacy for New York City comptroller. He told the New York Daily News that he was hoping voters would give him a ""fair shot."" In an interview with the New York Times, he said, ""I'm hopeful there will be forgiveness. I am asking for it."" It is easier for Spitzer to ask for it than to give it. Initial commentary has compared Spitzer (a former Slate columnist) to Anthony Weiner and Mark Sanford, candidates who have also run on the forgiveness and redemption ticket. But these comparisons don't capture the audacity of Spitzer's gambit. His appeal based on forgiveness asks voters to demonstrate a quality he has never shown in public life and which he implicitly promises not to show in the future. Before Spitzer became known as Client No. 9, he was known for his brash, hardball tactics. As New York's attorney general, he built a reputation as a fierce opponent of Wall Street, which created a successful platform for his gubernatorial bid. Once in higher office, things did not go well. After his first year, his disapproval rating was 48 percent to 37 percent. His rough style was such a problem, Quinnipiac pollsters asked voters whether Spitzer had the capacity to become ""a kinder, gentler governor."" Just before he was dragged down in the prostitution scandal, Spitzer was on the cusp of another one. The Albany district attorney declared, just days after Spitzer resigned, that the former governor had orchestrated a smear campaign against his political foe, Senate GOP leader Joe Bruno. Spittzer had authorized his staff to leak information about Bruno's use of state police aircraft, with the sign off: ""F--- him. He's a piece of s---, shove it up his a-- with a red-hot poker."" After 2008, during his time outside politics, Spitzer was just as combative. He was not particularly forgiving in his assessment of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. In late 2010, Spitzer said, ""Behind the scenes he is the dirtiest, nastiest political player out there, and that is his reputation from years in Washington."" But none of this may matter. Or, if it does, it may help him. Spitzer may be asking for forgiveness of his sexual indiscretions, but he's running on his reputation as attorney general, which was built on ruthlessness. On the first day of his campaign, Spitzer didn't refer back to his days as an unpopular governor. He says he hopes to reimagine the comptroller's office as he did the office of attorney general, where he earned the nickname, ""The Sheriff of Wall Street."" It was in this capacity that Spitzer, who has referred to himself as a ""steamroller,"" had a famous blow-up with John Whitehead, the former head of Goldman Sachs. In 2005, Whitehead, a longtime Wall Street veteran (full disclosure: he was married to my mom until her death in 1997), wrote a letter to the Wall Street Journal saying Spitzer had gone overboard in accusing AIG Chairman Hank Greenberg of illegal activities without ever indicting him. It was a version of what Alan Reynolds of the Cato Institute called ""Trial by Press Release."" According to Whitehead, Spitzer called him to respond to the letter: ""Mr. Whitehead, it's now a war between us and you've fired the first shot. I will be coming after you. You will pay the price. This is only the beginning and you will pay dearly for what you have done. You will wish you had never written that letter."" (So much for forgiving!) I may find Spitzer's overreaction symptomatic of an unsafe lack of stability and Lululemon-thin skin, but this is not likely to hurt Spitzer politically. As Ben Smith points out, ""Who now thinks that prosecutors and regulators were too hard on bankers in 2005?"" To do well, Spitzer actually doesn't need voters to forgive him. He needs enough voters to not care. There are any number of ways they may come about. They can write off the prostitution rap as simply a personal thing, missing the hypocrisy--Spitzer was paying for sex while as attorney general he was prosecuting prostitution rings. Or, they can value his lack of forgiveness as attorney general as a worthwhile quality in a job that requires him to monitor pension funds, bond issuances, and city spending, and which he hopes to expand into a watchdog of other areas, too. (Arguments on the merits are made by Reihan Salam and Josh Barro.) Or, they can just recognize his name and vote for the guy they know on the list. One final way voters may back Spitzer is that they may decide that he has been punished enough by his time in public purgatory. It's the kind of consideration some asked Spitzer to show to those he targeted, both officially and unofficially. He has to hope that voters are more generous with the red hot poker than he was."

""This announcement means even the Obama administration knows the 'train wreck' will only get worse,"" said House Speaker John Boehner. ""This further confirms that even the proponents of Obamacare know it will hurt jobs,"" said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. That was the appetizer. On Wednesday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent letters to the relevant agencies, asking why they'd failed and lied and failed about the employer mandate. The committee's Republicans wanted, among other things, ""all documents and communications, including e-mail, between administration officials and any individuals, companies, or organizations discussing the requirement that employers provide coverage to their employees."" They wanted this within two weeks. Got it? Thanks! As high-profile where-are-the-bodies investigations go, this one's fairly promising. Republicans are right: The administration oversold the ease with which businesses employing more than 50 full-time workers could comply with a health care mandate. That's about 4 percent of all businesses, and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius juggled waivers for the holdouts but otherwise promised that all was well. The Obama Treasury Department delayed the mandate because it knew Congress wasn't going to fix it. Republicans don't want to tweak the law as much as they want to bind it in chains and set it on fire, like some jargon-filled Necronomicon. Their strategy in 2009 and 2010 was to stop it from passing. Their strategy in 2011 and 2012 was to win an election and repeal the law. Their strategy today is both to win an election and repeal the law, and to have it collapse in failure. Today's GOP is approaching TED levels of innovation in undermining the law. In June, for example, Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn, the party's leader and whip in the Senate, sent letters to the NFL, NHL, NBA, PGA, and NASCAR asking them to please, please not help the administration advertise the Affordable Care Act. Sure, the Red Sox had helped advertise ""Romneycare"" in Massachusetts - but this was different. ""Just this week, a Gallup poll showed that a majority of Americans disapprove of Obamacare,"" wrote McConnell to Roger Goodell. ""The Massachusetts law was adopted by large bi-partisan majorities in a Democratic legislature and signed by a Republican governor. Obamacare was passed on a party-line vote, using extraordinary legislative gimmicks and widely ridiculed political favors to win passage."" Now, was there some American whose opinion of Obamacare would be totally changed during the Packers-Giants game? Probably not, but that's not the point: Republicans have taken every chance to shrink the Obamacare PR campaign. They deleted the law's PR budget, then raised hell about the administration moving around money and asking for help from private firms to promote it And that's just the undermining of the publicity for the law. The multistate rebellion against the law's Medicaid expansion money (the Supreme Court decision that saved the ACA made the Medicaid buy-in optional) is undermining the law itself. Any conservative will tell you that the states refusing the money are trying to make the law impossible to enact. ""Texas will not be held hostage to the Obama administration's attempt to force us into this fool's errand,"" said Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who, according to polls, could still be governor through 2018. If Republicans have 51 votes in the Senate come 2015, they'll try to repeal the taxes in Obamacare in their first budget. Since any such vote would need to be scored as deficit reduction, that might not be possible, but hey, maybe the ascension of President Chris Christie in 2017 will fix that. Look at how successful they've been in Wisconsin or North Carolina, where total control of the legislature has undone decades of labor and civil rights laws. If this seems nihilistic, please, pay more attention. Every high-level Republican strategy comes down to ""just stop the Democrats and win later."" There's a growing conservative consensus to stop immigration reform because Democrats can't be trusted in the conference committee. ""I think some of us who think it's a bad bill should probably do a little work to make sure it stays dead, dead, dead,"" said Bill Kristol last week. ""Here in Washington, these bills can emerge, zombie-like, you know?"" The appetite for replacing the cuts of sequestration is pretty well gone, to the surprise of Democrats. None of this is crazy. It's practically the duty of the out-party to make a lame duck president limp as soon as possible. Some Republicans think they did that when their Senate minority denied an up-down vote on gun control, and more of them think that the president is now too plagued by scandals to pressure them in their states and districts. But he's still the president. Promising not to make any deals with him doesn't shrink the size of government. Government keeps growing, and the president's the only player who can influence it. Sequestration consisted of random cuts, so agencies cut conferences and gave days off instead of actually restructuring. There's no chance of a climate bill coming out of this Congress, so the president's just rolled out more carbon regulations. Republicans criticize these ""power grabs,"" and they plan to campaign against them, but they don't actually stop them. They haven't even stopped the employer mandate. It's still alive, and McConnell spokesman Don Stewart didn't indicate that Congress might fix it by changing the threshold for number of employees or tying the mandate to payroll. ""Tying it to any threshold guarantees that many employers make that their ceiling,"" said Stewart in an e-mail. ""We've already seen hours cut to keep people under 30 and jobs cut (or not added) to keep payrolls below 50. It hasn't taken effect yet and it's already costing jobs (weird, it's almost like we predicted that)."" Republicans were right, so they get gloating rights, but for now, nothing else."

Bush met in Tanzania. Their wives were appearing together at a Bush Institute event and the two husbands attended a ceremony honoring the Americans who were killed in a 1998 embassy bombing. It was the first time two American presidents have met on foreign soil to commemorate a terrorist attack. The meeting on a distant battlefield in the war against terrorists was a reminder of the scope and continuity of the presidency. Osama Bin Laden had ordered the 1998 attack, Bush had sought him, and Obama gave the orders to kill him. Both men struggled to hunt al-Qaida and its offshoots across the globe and at home. The similarities between their domestic spy programs have lately inspired their critics to morph their pictures into one. In a recent interview, Bush took credit for launching the PRISM program that Obama continued, then approvingly quoted his successor. ""I think there needs to be a balance, and as the president explained, there is a proper balance."" It was fitting then that this meeting took place in Africa. As partisanship in politics has increased and calcified, the number of venues for genuine bipartisan fellow-feeling has shrunk. We experience it in the hours after a terrorist attack or natural disaster. Otherwise, it's up to the ex-presidents to keep the flame. They praise each other at library openings and as they work on global disasters like the earthquake in Haiti or tsunami in Japan. And then there's Africa, the only other venue on Earth where presidents regularly collaborate and say nice things about each other. Africa, a continent with pockets of disaster, spans both the presidency and the Presidents' Club. It is a place where presidents can focus money and attention when they have trouble being effective at home. It also has special redemptive powers in the post-presidential years: Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush have continued their service and been praised for it. This puts Africa high on the very short list of things presidents can praise about their predecessors that are free from partisan controversy. Africa is a useful stage for presidents as their power declines because the problems are so vast that the mere application of attention can help. Plus, a president can direct funds through the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation that Congress doesn't need to approve. That money, in a country where a little can go a long way, can be used to leverage private money. President Obama was in Africa launching Power Africa, a $7 billion plan to double access to power in sub-Saharan Africa. With two-thirds of the population in that region lacking electricity, the president offered this program as an opportunity to help lift the continent out of poverty. George W. Bush was the first president whose Africa policy became a key part of his legacy. In 2003, he founded the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which guaranteed $15 million to be spent over the course of five years on prevention, treatment, and research on HIV/AIDS. He launched it in his first term as a priority--the continent was not a second-term afterthought--and he has made it a core part of his post-presidency. This trip is his third since leaving office and included a visit to help repair a women's health clinic which his policies had helped open. Bono has praised Bush, as has Clinton, who said he had ""personally seen the faces of some of the millions of people who are alive today"" because of President Bush's policies. It was this bond over Africa that made Jimmy Carter the most emotional speaker at Bush's library opening. During Bush's time in office, Carter was a fierce critic of the president's Middle East policy and the invasion of Iraq. It's never easy for opponents from the opposite party to find specific praise at library unveilings, but Carter was effusive. ""Mr. President, let me say that I'm filled with admiration for you and deep gratitude for you about the great contributions you've made to the most needy people on Earth,"" said the 39th president. Though Africa is becoming a place for lame duck presidents to assert their influence, it is still not such a priority for officeholders that ex-presidents must stay away. (There is also plenty of suffering to alleviate.) So Africa has become the place where ex-presidents can do the most good without causing political headaches. The Clinton Global Initiative has tackled AIDS and the effects of drought. Jimmy Carter won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his efforts as president on Middle East peace, but also for his work in stopping the violence in the Sudan and for the Carter Center's focus on preventing disease in Africa's poorest villages. The common cause on Africa also allowed for an extended moment of sisterhood between first ladies this week. Laura Bush and Michelle Obama spoke at a conference of African First Ladies on women's education, health, and economic empowerment. The two joked about their husbands in private moments, the ridiculous roles the press forces on them, and their efforts to work around that to gain attention for the causes they care about. ""We take our bangs and we stand in front of important things that the world needs to see,"" said the first lady after Laura Bush had made a joke about the press focus on her hairstyle. ""Eventually, people stop looking at the bangs and they start looking at what we're standing in front of."" It was a warm and friendly exchange which included a shared joke about the confines of the office. Moderator Cokie Roberts said Martha Washington had called the White House the ""Chief State Prison""--a sentiment shared by many presidents. Both women offered a knowing laugh when Michelle Obama affirmed there were ""prison elements,"" which she followed by saying, ""It's a really nice prison."" Laura Bush responded, ""But with a chef."" As if to prove their point about the distortions and restraints that come with the job, anti-Obama commentators characterized the quote as if Mrs. Obama were making a haughty whine. (The Drudge Report's headline: ""I'm In A 'Prison.' "") Africa may be a place of bipartisan cooperation, but not for everyone."

First of all, congratulations! Second, whether or not you can keep this job now depends on biennial shareholder votes. The day you take the job, there are 100 shareholders, and 60 of them support you. But on your second day, you get a proposal that would expand the shareholder pool over time, and you know that two out of three of the new additions would vote to remove you. Because you're not an idiot, you deposit this plan in the circular file. Now do you understand the plight of the Republican members of Congress? Immigration reform has been dumped in front of their doors like a USA Today in a midpriced family hotel. Most of them have no political reason to support it, and never will. Until now the conversation about the bill's congressional prospects has been a Lindsey Graham monologue with occasional Ted Cruz footnotes, as if the House didn't have its own priorities and math. This is the math. Republicans currently control 234 of the House's 435 voting districts. In 210 of these districts--eight short of the votes you need to elect a speaker--the Hispanic share of the vote is below 25 percent. Of the other 24 districts where Hispanic voters might be problematic for a Republican who attacks the immigration bill, 12 went for Mitt Romney over Barack Obama. So, if House Republicans held every one of their current seats that only have a tiny fraction of Hispanics, and the dozen with solid Hispanic votes but Republican tendencies, they'd have the majority with four votes to spare. ""Nonwhite voters are a threat to Republican White House chances in 2016, but hardly a threat to the House Republican majority,"" says David Wasserman, House race editor of the Cook Political Report. It's clear just how skeptical House Republicans are of immigration reform when you consider that one of those 24 sent to Washington from the mixed, white/Hispanic districts is Texas Rep. Lamar Smith (Hispanic vote in his district: 27 percent), who was chairman of the House Judiciary Committee until this year, and who still gets a committee vote on a possible immigration bill. Before Thursday's vote Smith tweeted that ""the #Senate #immigration bill ignores the will of the #American people & puts the interests of illegal immigrants & foreign workers first."" Smith isn't worried about any backlash to a vote against the immigration bill. Neither are most of his colleagues. The 2010 round of congressional redistricting ensured that two out of three Hispanic voters now live in Democratic districts. Pro-reform scolds have known that for a while. ""If people are only looking at their own little backyards, yes, there are a lot of Republicans who can afford to vote no with no immediate repercussions,"" says Florida-based GOP strategist Ana Navarro. ""Sure, if you're in the middle of Iowa, you'll be fine, but I'd like to think there are enough responsible adults in the Republican Party to pass a bill."" But the Republican skeptics think they're being responsible, too. Any ""comprehensive"" reform they support will, by nature and design, allow more people to compete legally for jobs. That's never going to be popular in their districts. While the opposition to immigration reform has been milder and quieter than it was in 2006-2007, there are still hints of white backlash. We saw a tremor of that this month; Republicans noticed that the Senate's bill gave employers a small incentive to hire guest workers, because doing so would duck Obamacare's requirements to provide health benefits. So, what's easier for Republicans? To give in and pass a bill that might add Hispanic voters to your districts, whom you then have to win over; or blocking the bill and upping your share of the white vote? That's hardly a dilemma at all, and explains why the Senate bill faces such a hard road in the House. As they contemplate 2014 and 2016, Republicans are looking at elections where the white share of the vote may increase compared with 2012. They compare elections when Barack Obama was on the ballot against elections when he wasn't. The white shares of the vote in 2008, 2010, and 2012 were, respectively, 74 percent, 77 percent, and 72 percent. ""I don't look at Obama completely as stunt casting,"" says Florida-based GOP strategist Rick Wilson, ""but the fact that he was the first minority president moved a lot of minority voters. And right now the group of possible Democratic nominees for 2016 looks like a meeting of the Robert Byrd fan club. It's the white boy coalition. None of these guys will light a fire for black voters."" But Republicans, increasingly, light a fire with whites. From 2008 to 2012, Barack Obama's share of the white vote fell from 43 percent to 39 percent. Right after the election, the fact that Obama scored a smaller white vote than Michael Dukakis was cited as proof that the GOP needed to change. Flip the logic. If Republicans can build on the white trend but Democrats can't build on the nonwhite trends, Republicans will be safe, for a while. If Republicans get back to the 66 percent white vote won by Ronald Reagan in 1984, they're golden. Democrats don't see that happening. ""How the hell can they do better among whites than they did in 2012?"" asks Paul Begala, a former Bill Clinton strategist who worked for the pro-Obama 2012 super PAC Priorities USA. ""Can they really ever get 66 percent of the white vote again? No way. First, because their white voters are old: Romney got 61 percent of whites over age 65, but only 51 percent of whites 18 to 29. What the demographers euphemistically call 'cohort replacement' is working against the GOP.  Other white subgroups, like college-educated women, gave Romney just 52 percent."" Speaking of women! ""If Hillary runs in 2016,"" says Begala, ""she has a good shot at building on Obama's dominance among younger whites and his strength among white college grads, and perhaps even outperform him among white working-class voters."" Perhaps, but we have a better idea of what a huge white vote looks like than a post-Obama non-white/-millennial supergroup looks like. Immigration reformers have to convince House Republicans to embrace the uncertainty, and fear the familiar."	Do House Republicans Actually Need Hispanic Votes? Or Can They Pursue More White Votes Instead?	['Clinton', 'Romney', 'Cruz', 'Cook', 'Paul', 'Obama']	[]

But now that his poll numbers are dipping, he lacks the personal relationships to fall back on when the worm turns--in part because he's stayed so above the fray. Here's how it happened, in an excerpt from Jonathan Alter's The Center Holds: Obama and his Enemies, out now from Simon & Schuster. Suffering fools had always been part of the presidency. George Washington held weekly dinners with legislators--senators one week, congressmen the next. Franklin Roosevelt filled part of many workdays with 15-minute meetings with individual members of Congress, some of whom got to stay for cocktails that FDR mixed himself. Ronald Reagan and House Speaker Tip O'Neill traded barbs in public but made time for plenty of jokes in private. By contrast, the Obamas, with the help of Valerie Jarrett, adopted an informal code in the White House. Obama would bring members of Congress into the White House for large meetings and maybe even give them a ride on Air Force One when he went to their state, but the socializing they craved, the invitations to dinner or a movie, were not often part of the package. His excuse for not having the GOP leadership over more often was that he had repeatedly invited them and they usually said no. And he had unpleasant memories of intensely courting Republican senators in 2009 to no avail. After passage of the Recovery Act, which won the support of three moderate Republican senators, he received no Republican support at all on his other major legislative victories of 2009 and 2010. He spent many hours with Maine Republican Olympia Snowe, whose objections to Obamacare (including some from the left) he was sure he addressed. But under pressure from her leader, Mitch McConnell, she too voted no. Obama believed that the days of politicians in Washington settling everything over bourbon and branch water (or, in the case of Reagan and O'Neill, a couple of beers) were over. It used to be that if a president leaned on a member to change his vote, most of his constituents wouldn't find out. But in the age of instant access to voting records and 24-hour cable, the threat of being ""primaried"" trumped any influence that might come from a ride on Air Force One or a trip to Camp David. Besides, Obama liked to think of himself as nontransactional, above the petty deals, ""donor maintenance,"" and phony friendships of Washington. Here his self-awareness again failed him. In truth, he was all transactional in his work life. He reserved real relationships for family, friends from before he was president, and a few staff. Everything else was business. The senators and billionaires who longed to brag about their private advice to the president were consistently disappointed. Defensive on this point, Obama didn't believe that listening to powerful blowhards was generally worth his time. But that is the thing about relationships: They're investments that don't necessarily pay off right away. His failure to use the trappings of the presidency more often left him with one less tool in his toolbox, one less way to leverage his authority. It was a sign of his talent that he was quite good at a part of the job that he didn't much enjoy. At fundraisers he was lithe and charming and, most of the time, seemed fully present in the moment. Flashing that thousand-watt smile and exchanging pleasantries were enough for some, but others yearned for at least the impression of friendship, or what passes for it in Washington. Obama wasn't a loner, just a relatively normal person--warm with his friends--who preferred not to hang out too much with people he barely knew. This was a fine quality in an individual but problematic for a president. Part of the explanation lay in his upbringing. He hadn't spent his early life planning how to become important, as Johnson and Clinton had. Nor was he a legacy, soaked in politics from an early age. No one had to instruct the Roosevelts, Kennedys, Bushes (and Romneys) on how to build lists and get credit for their gratitude. Bargaining was in the background of most of Obama's predecessors. Eisenhower learned to negotiate with balky allies during the World War II, and Reagan gained bargaining experience as president of the Screen Actors Guild. Unlike Reagan, Clinton, and Bush, Obama had never been a governor herding state legislators, and his experience closing deals with Republicans in the Illinois State Senate and the U.S. Senate was minimal. (It was no coincidence that the last two presidents before Obama who went directly from the Senate to the White House were John F. Kennedy in 1961 and Warren G. Harding in 1921, and neither got much done with Congress.) In Democratic Chicago he rarely had to talk to people who fundamentally disagreed with him. His self-image was that of a bridge-builder, but he came up so fast that he'd never built a big one. The president didn't have the schmooze gene. Politics self-selects for certain traits, the most common of which is an essential neediness, an emotional hole many politicians are trying to fill that makes them crave attention, thrive on the artificial calories provided by superficial relationships, and make the personal sacrifices necessary for public life. Obama's childhood in Hawaii was marked by a peculiar combination of abandonment and unconditional love. It bred self-reliance and security. By the time he left Chicago for Harvard in 1988, he had the ambition and willingness to sacrifice that is standard equipment in politicians, but he lacked the neediness that is usually part of the package. As he ascended, this made the inherent neediness of other politicians, CEOs, and other high achievers an abstraction for him, not a shared condition. The backslapping, stroking, gripping, and grinning that were second nature to politicians like Clinton and Biden were often chores for Obama. During a scene in By the People, a documentary about the 2008 campaign, Obama complains loudly to his staff about having to work rope lines. Where Clinton usually found such contact energizing, Obama frequently found it enervating. There were exceptions; at the end of a campaign, when the competitive juices were flowing, he liked pressing the flesh just fine, but he rarely stuck around to soak up the love longer than the schedule demanded. He didn't need to. Obama wasn't as self-pitying as many politicians, but he often complained about how hard the job was. Early on, one of his first big financial supporters, a Chicagoan, brought him up short in the Oval Office by saying, ""You wanted this. We all worked like hell to put you here. Stop complaining."" Obama smiled and said he was right and not enough people talked to him that way. This supporter always knew Obama had a huge ego--anyone challenging Hillary Clinton with so little experience had to have one--but he thought Obama had been humbled by the opposition's intransigence. He had never failed to bring anyone around before, and it changed him. You could see it at public events in 2011, before he put on his friendly game face for the campaign. For those who knew him, and for many who didn't, his vibe was unmistakable in the East Room: I'll flash a smile, then, please, someone get me the hell out of here. It wasn't that he had to be back in the Oval Office for something urgent. He just didn't want to hang out for an instant longer than he had to, even with long-lost Chicago friends. The quality that his girlfriend from the 1980s, Genevieve cook, described as ""a bit of a wall--the veil,"" was back. The encounters when Obama would stand very close and use his height and star power to leave admirers swooning were rarer, except at fundraisers, when he knew he had to turn it on. He sometimes exuded an unspoken exasperation: I saved Detroit, the DOW is up, we avoided a depression--I have to explain this to all of you again? When the president got away from elites and spent time with those he called ""ordinary folks,"" he relaxed. Even if they disagreed with him on certain things, most Americans still liked and trusted him. The fact that he wasn't a typical politician and stayed above the fray was a huge asset in their minds. The same traits that hurt him in Washington helped keep his poll numbers afloat. As time went on, he began to enjoy his trips out of town--not the fundraisers (as many as six in one day at the height of the campaign) but the other interactions. In his second term, he told friends, he would spend much more time outside Washington. The comparisons between Obama and Clinton and Obama and Johnson weren't fair. Clinton was the most natural politician in memory, yet even his Olympic-caliber schmoozing skills did nothing to protect him from impeachment. Johnson, a former Senate majority leader known for his persuasiveness with former colleagues, had earmarks to hand out and a filibuster-proof supermajority in the Senate on every issue except civil rights. But Obama didn't do himself any favors by undervaluing the importance of personal relationships in getting anything done in Washington. His not especially creative staff hardly helped. On the domestic side, the policymaking process was simultaneously ad hoc and super controlled, a combination that led to risk-averse decisions when decisions were made at all. In 2008 Obama accused McCain of not being able to multitask; now his White House staff sometimes seemed to have the same problem, focusing on only one issue at a time. And the reverence for the boss within the White House was a little unhealthy.

Two issues that various Republicans have said require the party to evolve or die have been thrust into the national spotlight: Immigration reform is on its way to passing the Senate, and the Supreme Court offered two major victories for the supporters of marriage equality. With comprehensive immigration reform, the more progress it makes, the louder the voices of opposition. But in the wake of the Supreme Court decisions on same-sex marriage, the reaction was markedly different, suggesting that the forces of progress have momentum on their side. Both issues test whether the Republican Party will regain its national stature through forward-looking appeals to a changing electorate or whether it will do so through standing fast to principle and letting that new electorate be drawn to the Republican Party. This debate pits social conservatives against the libertarian populists and generation against generation. It's been going on since Mitt Romney lost, long enough for there to be a debate about whether the debate is even necessary--long enough, in fact, for some to take both sides of that debate. In January, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal knocked the GOP as ""the stupid party"" for the way some of its members spoke in public, but is now telling the GOP to stop the ""bedwetting"" about the way it is perceived. If you like unscripted politics, this has been an exciting week: As these wedge issues have become national news, the leaderless party has been fighting about core principles with a passion that no one can control. Those who have argued that the GOP must embrace marriage equality hoped that the court's decision would quiet debate. Large majorities of younger voters support same-sex marriage (81 percent in an ABC poll), which means it's a key to reaching a younger demographic and also probably irreversible. ""There are a lot of Republicans who believe that it's time to move on from this,"" says veteran Iowa GOP strategist Dave Kochel who ran Romney's campaign there. ""Same-sex marriage is legal in Iowa and has been for four years. And regardless of need for some Iowa activists to continue to raise money and apply litmus tests on candidates, it's time to move on and allow the GOP to be open and hospitable to people who may disagree with our platform. I don't think anyone will be successful in rolling back the clock."" ""Jesus wept,"" is how Mike Huckabee characterized his reaction to the Supreme Court rulings in a fundraising letter. For those who view the decisions as a blow to traditional marriage, the battle now turns to the states. Presidential hopefuls courting social conservatives will need to campaign in those local battles. ""Twenty years ago Republican establishment figures were saying abortion was a losing issue,"" says one conservative strategist. ""Earlier this year, Time magazine's cover said that the battle is over and the pro-life side has won. More than 30 states have voted to protect marriage. It's not the end, it's just the beginning."" Once and future presidential candidate Rick Santorum made the abortion link immediately in his response to the ruling ""The DOMA decision is another case of the high court overstepping its role, just as it did with Roe v. Wade."" The abortion analogy is flawed though, say Republicans in support of marriage equality. ""This is not abortion,"" says a GOP veteran strategist. ""You cannot convince this nation's young people that two same-sex people, in love, just like them, are not entitled access to the same institution as they are because they are straight. It doesn't hold water. Same-sex marriage is about freedom, fairness, equality--""the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"" if you will. With abortion, you can in fact change minds because you have new technology, sonogram images and a better chance for survival later in the term."" The Republican Party is already a long way from 2004, when George Bush sought to help his re-election by proposing a constitutional amendment blocking same-sex marriage. No party leaders are calling for that now, and most of the initial responses were muted. Lawmakers talked about disappointment in the ruling, but not in the emphatic tones that might inspire social conservatives. Judging by their public comments, they were much more focused on President Obama's climate-change proposals and his ""war on coal."" The clear message from the tepid reaction to the Supreme Court rulings is that on this question about the party's future, the momentum in the Republican Party is toward changing with the times.

The winner will be Rep. Ed Markey, the 66-year-old Democratic congressman from Malden. The loser will be Gabriel Gomez, a likable-enough neophyte who tried and failed to turn his 24-carat resume--Navy SEAL/private-equity money/Hispanic/handsome--into a surprise Republican win. Markey, who's been in the House since the Jimmy Carter era, will move to the other side of Constitution Avenue. Ever since February, when former Sen. Scott Brown passed on the race and seemed to end Republican hopes of winning it, Markey's held a solid lead. The lead dragged as low as 4 points, but that was when Gomez was earning headlines like ""The Next Scott Brown?"" and ""Is Gabriel Gomez the Next Scott Brown?"" and (my personal favorite) ""Is Gabriel Gomez the Next Scott Brown?"" He wasn't, but neither was Scott Brown: Look again at that word in front of his name, ""former."" Before the media tosses this election down the memory hole, I want to pay tribute to our incurable addiction to narratives and the search for Meaning in elections. The search for Meaning overpowers things like data and political science. Anyone who looked at the numbers and candidates and parties in March could have told you that Markey would win, and yet the race was covered as a toss-up. Elections aren't sequels with hot new actors. Massachusetts Republicans didn't have much to play with after they lost Scott Brown. The solution: Convince the press that this election was a reprise of the 2010 special election that Brown won over state Attorney General Martha Coakley. The press blew that election so badly that ever since it's been primed to watch for conservative surges out of nowhere. Coakley was a machine politician who'd been groomed for higher office, but not tested. But Markey had been crushing opponents for a generation. His smallest-ever win, 62 percent of the vote, was 21 years ago. The comparison didn't work. Coakley was a master of stupid gaffes. Early on, Republicans tried to portray Markey as a bumbler for comparing the Citizens United decision to Dred Scott and for bragging about all the technology that developed after he passed the 1992 Cable Act. But these weren't actually gaffes. Meanwhile, Gomez was nowhere near as talented as Brown. Gomez stuck to a series of talking points and lacked Brown's grasp of legislative tactics. I didn't notice this until his second debate with Markey, when the candidates were asked about the breaking Edward Snowden scandal. Markey seemed to know the basics of the story. Gomez emptied out a bowl of word salad: I think this NSA and Snowden is just a direct reflection of what's going on down in D.C. You know, in the campaign, the Congressman Markey--who, I'm sorry sir, but you are Washington, D.C.--is emblematic of what we face right now, and that's a lack of confidence in what's going on down there. You know, after 37 years, you know, I think it's time to restore some integrity and some honor down there, so that we the people, our first reaction always should not be mistrust and failure in our institutions down in D.C. He wasn't usually this bad, but he had other problems. Gomez also had the wrong message. Again, it's tough to compare the guy to Scott Brown. When Brown ran, he could promise voters that he'd be the #41st vote (that was the hashtag) against the Affordable Care Act. Even in Massachusetts, that was a winning issue--a (Republican) exit poll found that 52 percent of voters wanted Brown to kill the bill. Gomez didn't have an issue like that, so he ran against the stuff voters didn't seem to like. One of them was ""Washington."" Another was Republicans who were more conservative than him, such as Rep. Trent Franks. After Franks suggested that the ""incidence of rape resulting from pregnancies"" was low, Gomez called Franks a ""moron."" (In the classic Gomez style, he kind of got stuck on that word and used it three times in one interview.) This was a doomed strategy, because it didn't have a ready audience. ""It looks like the Gomez campaign brain trust has very little confidence in the work of political scientists,"" wrote an actual political scientist, Jerold Duquette, 11 days ago. ""Gomez's cookie-cutter, candidate-centered, anti-politics, anti-Washington campaign is overtly directed at the voters who are least likely to turnout for a special election in June."" Polls do not always mean what you want them to mean. The nadir of Gomez-hype came on June 10, when a Suffolk University poll found Markey's lead dropping from 17 points to 7 points. The simple explanation was that the election was getting closer and the ""likely voter"" screen had tightened. But the pollster theorized that ""Obama administration scandals, especially the Associated Press phone records scrutiny, have touched a nerve with likely voters."" In Washington and Boston, there was born a ""scandals drag down Markey"" narrative. It was baseless. The Suffolk poll was an outlier, the only one in the field that showed Markey dropping. Few reports on the poll pointed out that the president's popularity was still far higher than it had been during the Coakley swoon. People wanted the story without the context, as if just checking other polls wasn't incredibly easy to do. Counting money was even easier. Money and data really do matter. Markey and his allies decided to bury his opponents early, starting with primary opponent Rep. Stephen Lynch and continuing with Gomez. (Worth mentioning at this point: Lynch was also called ""Scott Brown redux"" before Markey pasted him.) Markey outraised Gomez $7.6 million to $2.3 million, and ""green"" Markey endorsers outspent Gomez endorsers 3-1. The spending perfectly predicted the election. The Cook Political Report, which briefly rated the race a ""toss-up,"" did so because the spending seemed to confirm a Markey panic. ""We changed the rating [to toss-up] and then began to see some other numbers, from even more reliable pollsters/sources, with a wider margin that convinced us that the race either hadn't closed or had widened back out,"" says Charlie Cook. ""The fact that the DSCC dumped in a seven-digit television buy around the same time suggested that we weren't alone in thinking that Markey did not have the race in the bag."" He didn't, but he never thought he did, so he spent money. That money's going to undergird the coming (probably brief) Republican autopsy of this race. Over the weekend, The Wall Street Journal reported on donors ""sitting out"" the Massachusetts race even though its candidate ""fits the profile that many in the party see as desirable."" Politico finally declared that Gomez was ""no Scott Brown redux"" in part because ""big GOP money never came to save him."" It's like we all slept through those 2012 elections where super PACs blitzed the airwaves for Republican Senate candidates and the Democrats won anyway. No, the Gomez dream is going to fade away in a hurry. Last month, Washington Post blogger Jennifer Rubin wrote that Republicans could make a race in Massachusetts if they bothered to. ""Odds still favor Markey by virtue of the overwhelming Democratic advantage in the state,"" wrote Rubin. ""At a time when the president is in a second-term tailspin, it is an opportunity for Republicans to see if they can 'send a message,' turn out in force in an off-year election and grab one seat."" A month later, she insisted that Markey was ""proving to be as awful a candidate as Martha Coakley, who lost to Scott Brown,"" and gave a GOP operative anonymity to snark that Markey ""couldn't tell you who bats first for the Red Sox."" If only Republicans would pony up and buy ads, ""it's very possible Gomez could pull this out."" Earlier today, while digging through the archives of the Gomez Golden Age, I joked on Twitter about these columns. Rubin challenged my reading comprehension skills. ""I predicted he'd lose,"" she wrote in an email. One Next Scott Brown goes down tonight. Still, a next one waits to be born."

7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/06/immigration_reform_bill_will_the_house_even_care_if_it_gets_70_senate_votes.html	"Last night, in the runup to a final vote on immigration reform, the Senate passed a Republican-led amendment that would add new border security measures and fund 20,000 more border guards, four times the number proposed in previous Republican amendments. Bill supporters believe that the amendment makes it more likely the final bill will win 70 votes, and that in turn would put pressure on the House to pass it, too. Three days earlier, I'd asked Rep. Luis Gutierrez about this plan. The buoyant would-be dealmaker was talking to activists at the annual lefty Netroots Nation convention. Was he on board with the Senate scheme? No, he wasn't. ""Their bill is going to pass with more than 70 votes,"" said Gutierrez. ""It's going to pass at a huge price. Look: Diversity visas went. Siblings went. I didn't get to negotiate any of that with my Republican counterparts--they looked at me and they said, you already gave that up! What am I supposed to tell them, I'll give them 20,000 more border guards? There was very little room to negotiate, and there was no pressure on the House of Representatives."" The problem with the theory is that there really isn't any pressure on House Republicans. Late last year, the Gang of Eight senators gathered in a Senate TV studio and promised to craft some sort of immigration bill. These were heady times, with pundits predicting as many as 90 Senate votes for an immigration bill, because of course Republicans had to win back Hispanic voters and of course this was the way to do it. By June, the Gang members were saying that ""70 votes""--probably every Democrat and 15 Republicans--would have to vote for their bill to give it a zipline into the House. Democrats are finally starting to ask whether that's true. Why would any House Republican care about a vote total in the Senate? From time to time, yes, a Senate supermajority will act first on a compromise bill, but that's almost always one forced upon the Congress by duress, disappointing everyone. The fiscal cliff deal, the debt limit deal, the tax limit deal, all of these followed the ""supermajority trickle-down"" theory. What's the difference between those bills and an immigration bill? Crisis. Immigration reform moves through the House only if Republicans fear the consequences of stalling it. In November, after Barack Obama managed to beat them again, conservatives really did fear what would happen if they didn't cut into the nonwhite vote. That fear is ebbing. You can see the signs if you watch Sen. Marco Rubio. In the first months of 2013, Rubio started calling into conservative talk shows to make a talking point-heavy pitch for immigration reform. The hosts went along with it. ""You are recognizing reality,"" nodded Rush Limbaugh. I followed Rubio around a talk radio convention and watched him humble half a dozen second-rate hosts. They didn't know how to attack the bill. They do now. Yesterday, as they fought against an amendment slopping even more border security onto the immigration bill, Senate Republicans made two arguments. One: They'd only had ""a weekend"" to read the 110-page amendment. ""They're triple spaced pages!"" insisted Sen. Bob Corker, one of the authors. ""Any middle school student in Tennessee or Alabama could read this amendment in 20 minutes."" But Republicans like Sen. Ted Cruz reminded each other of the vote on the Affordable Care Act, another time they were asked to push something through in a hurry, without gaming out all the provisions. ""The majority rushed through a complex bill so no one would know what's in it!"" drawled Sen. Jeff Sessions. Two: They don't think this bill will ""secure the border,"" and neither does their base. The new amendment was quickly nicknamed the ""border surge,"" which Republicans subjected to a series of eye rolls. ""When I say [we'll achieve] '90 percent control of the border,' people in Oklahoma look askance,"" said Sen. Tom Coburn. ""They say, that means 10 percent are still coming. And that 10 percent is the worst."" And this was how Republicans talked after Democrats made all their available concessions. House Republicans are not impressed. They've already signaled that a bill that passes the Senate quickly will be suspect because it passed so quickly. ""An opportunity to fix it does not mean, 'oh, we gotta meet some artificial deadline to keep up with the Senate,' "" said Rep. Bob Goodlatte, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, in a chat with National Review. ""Especially if the Senate produces a bill that's had few hearings and gets done on a schedule that suggests they haven't spent as much time looking at the details."" Democrats always expected the House to take that skeptical approach. All they need is for the House to pass a bill, really any bill. It could even be something called ""immigration reform"" that doesn't stop deportations or include any path to citizenship. ""We need to get to conference,"" said Rep. Gutierrez, meaning the Senate and the House need to meet after two bills have been passed, and then hopefully pass something Democrats can tolerate. So today's amendment, based on language by Corker and Sen. John Hoeven, was supposed to prove that there were 70 votes for a tough-enough bill. There were 67 votes in the room, maybe 69 had two Georgia senators not been socked in at the Atlanta airport. After he voted ""aye,"" Mississippi Republican Sen. Roger Wicker walked into a crowd of reporters and admitted that he leaned ""no"" on the full bill. What could win him over? Oh, more amendments. According to Corker, senators might craft a deal and vote on 20 more amendments--10 from each side--in the hopes of climbing to 70 votes. They keep talking as if their comrades in the House would notice."	Will the House Even Care if the Immigration Bill Wins 70 Votes in the Senate?

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/06/dave_camp_and_the_tea_party_s_rally_against_the_irs_conservatives_won_t.html	"The single most important politician at Wednesday's Tea Party rally against the Internal Revenue Service spoke for less than two minutes. He wasn't drowned out by applause, either. Michigan Rep. Dave Camp was merely explaining how he was going to shoehorn the IRS scandal into the headlines and cable news chyrons again. ""My committee was trying to get answers from the IRS for two years,"" said Camp, the chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. ""We know that conservative donors were threatened with gift taxes. Conservatives had confidential tax information leaked."" This was not the scandal that stirred the Tea Party one month ago. Sure, the scandals sound similar, and for Camp to succeed, one story needs to bleed into the other like two murals caught in the rain. They need to because the theory that President Obama ordered his IRS to slow-walk the applications of Tea Party groups has been methodically shredded by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee--or maybe just by the facts of the case. Democrats took back the story last week, when they made a counterintuitive request for more information from Rep. Darrell Issa. The House Oversight chairman had asked for the initial inspector general report on the IRS after Tea Party groups complained (with merit) that they were getting irksome, obsessive questionnaires about their groups. There was a scandal there about the biases of bureaucrats, but Republicans, naturally, attempted to solve the case deductively. They knew what President Obama thought about the Tea Party, and they knew Democrats had wanted to challenge the tax exemptions of conservative ""educational"" groups, mega-PACs with nonprofit status. Surely there was a smoking gun somewhere in the files. There wasn't. Democrats challenged Republican investigators to publish their long-form interviews with IRS agents. On Tuesday, the Democrats did it themselves and publicized an interview with a witness who, when asked about a Politico story that suggested Issa had overreached in his investigation, absolved the White House. ""Was the decision to screen and centralize the review of Tea Party cases the targeting of the president's political enemies?"" asked the investigator. ""I do not believe that the screening of those cases had anything to do other than consistency and identifying issues that needed to have further development,"" replied the witness. Issa pronounced himself ""deeply disappointed,"" because the interview might work as ""a roadmap for IRS officials to navigate investigative interviews with Congress."" Democrats, he said, were ""flailing"" because they'd been ""unsuccessfully trying to convince the American people that IRS officials in Washington did not play a role in inappropriate scrutiny of Tea Party groups."" And that was part of the story, but it wasn't the part Democrats were trying to debunk. They wanted to let the White House slide. Hey, look--it worked. And so the focus has slid over to Camp. He's attempting to broaden the focus of a probe and ask whether any IRS audits of individuals--not of groups--were conducted on orders from the Obama administration. The conservative media has been on that story almost as long as Camp has, with Wall Street Journal columnist Kimberley Strassel arguing that ""an Obama campaign website [that] named and slurred eight Romney donors"" effectively turned the IRS loose on them. The National Organization for Marriage has sued the IRS over the 2012 leak of its tax documents to the pro-gay Human Rights Campaign; at Wednesday's rally in Washington, D.C., National Organization for Marriage president Brian Brown declared that the IRS ""took our private tax information and gave it to the co-chair of Barack Obama's campaign!"" If just one story bears out and the White House called in an audit, the fallout would devastate the administration. So the hunt continues, and the argument slowly evolves from ""they targeted tax exemptions"" to ""they audited conservatives."" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz used his speech at the rally to stoke sympathy for the campaign donors, those who dared ""to speak up, to bundle, to contribute, to participate."" A crowd of thousands cheered--for high-dollar campaign bundlers. An Obama-led campaign to audit conservatives is the sort of fact you hardly need to prove. An Ohioan named George Brunemann told the crowd that he'd been hassled by the taxman and that ""the IRS agent who audited me said, 'You are being audited because of your association with the South Cincinnati Tea Party.' "" (In interviews back home, he's described this agent as ""almost apologetic."") Iowa Rep. Steve King, who got to Congress a decade ago, said he entered politics after ""the IRS audited me one too many years in a row."" This sentiment is winning. Republicans argue that the Justice Department and FBI are too compromised to conduct this investigation, and they've got some running room. Last week, when Public Policy Polling asked whether Attorney General Eric Holder should resign, only 34 percent said no and 41 percent said yes. A CNN poll this week logged an even better result; the percentage of people convinced that the White House ""ordered the IRS"" to send in the Stasi had surged by 10 points since May. The sentiment thrived in Wednesday's crowd, too. Gene McIlhone, who'd written ""DEATH + TAXES IN ONE FELL SWOOP"" on his poncho, thought about the last fortune cookie he'd cracked open. The piece of paper inside read: ""A master can direct without speaking."" That said it all about Obama. ""He hired the kind of people who knew what they had to do,"" and he ""will go down in history as the greatest Marxist who ever lived."" Carol Lennon had drove from Clearwater, Fla., to make the rally--17 hours, overnight. Her brother-in-law's auto-body shop was targeted by the IRS, and she knew it was because he donated to the Tea Party. What was the president's role? ""Even if he doesn't come out and say it,"" she said, ""they know that's what he wants."""	How the Tea Party Is Keeping the IRS Scandal Alive	['Issa', 'Cruz', 'Romney', 'Obama']	[]
9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/06/barack_obama_s_approval_rating_is_down_do_poll_numbers_matter_for_a_second.html	"Barack Obama's poll numbers are sliding. Around Christmastime, his average approval rating, according to RealClearPolitics, was nearly 54 percent, 12 points higher than his average disapproval rating of 42 percent. Now his numbers have flipped. His average approval rating at 46.6 percent is roughly 2 points lower than his disapproval rating at 48.3 percent. If these numbers hold, President Obama is never going to get re-elected. Obviously, Obama is not up for re-election, which raises the question: How important are approval ratings for his second term? House Republicans aren't suddenly going to stop listening to him if his numbers decline. They're already ignoring him and not embracing his agenda. In the elections of 2014, vulnerable Senate Democrats are competing in states where the president's approval rating has stunk for a long time. It won't be affected by a national drop; it can't go much lower. In this constricted climate, Obama's falling approval ratings may be less important than for past presidents, except in one key area: implementing health care reform. It is the president's signature legislative achievement, but he needs to convince the public to sign up. To do that, he still needs them to trust him. The traditional view of the approval rating is that it gives us a fix on the status of the president's power to persuade other lawmakers on a given day. If the president's approval rating is high, politicians will be more easily convinced. They won't want to upset voters who are apt to listen to the president or who are rooting for him. Or, as in high school, they'll simply want to associate themselves with the ideas of the popular guy. Approval rating is the power setting on the bully pulpit. Presidential historians have long debated how much a president can persuade the public, even when his approval numbers are high. (These powers are more limited than popular perception holds.) Still, a president's public voice and ability to set the agenda are the best tools he has to shape domestic matters and help him sustain support for the foreign engagements he has the power to launch. But what if the politicians he needs to convince live in a separate political universe de-linked from the president? If so, his approval rating won't matter. House Republican conservatives will determine whether immigration reform passes or whether a meaningful budget deal can be reached. Many of those House Republicans couldn't care less about the president's approval ratings: Their constituents dislike the president and are probably never going to change their mind. (That might change if Obama's approval rating was 65 percent, but that's not possible until the economy is booming.) For this reason, on many issues, even if the president's approval rating were 5 points higher, it wouldn't matter. Partisanship has made any presidential connection toxic. When the president associates himself with an issue, it is more likely to turn Republicans against it and therefore decrease its chances of passing. We're seeing this with immigration reform, where Obama has purposefully stayed in the background during Congressional negotiations at the advice of Republicans who say if he campaigns for the measure, he will make it harder for them to pass the bill. (Immigration reform will pass only if Republicans believe that it is in their self-interest, which has little to do with Obama's popularity.) As a political matter, the president's approval rating should matter for Democrats up for re-election in 2014. If Obama is unpopular, the thinking goes, he will drag House and Senate Democrats down. We saw this with President Bush in 2006, where Democrats picked up five seats in the Senate and 30 seats in the House. As John Sides points out, the share of seats controlled by the president's party depends in part on presidential approval. But Democrats are already facing a grim landscape next year. The nine most vulnerable seats are either held by a Democrat or are open seats where a Democrat is retiring. In states like Montana, Arkansas, Alaska, Louisiana, West Virginia, and North Carolina, the president's approval ratings are already so low that the decline in his national standing isn't going to change things much. In some key Midwestern contests like Iowa, Michigan, and Minnesota, however, the president's weakness could matter. In the House, there are nine toss-up races, according to the Cook Political Report. Eight of them are Democratic seats; life for these candidates will get harder as Obama becomes more of an albatross. The one Republican in a toss-up district gets to breathe easier because his opponent is busy trying to enliven discouraged Democrats and define himself as distinct from Obama. The GOP candidate's strategy gets easier, too, the more trouble the president gets in. He simply ties his opponent to the man at the top. This phenomenon also holds for those seats in the next category of competition--the 11 seats that are leaning toward the Democrat and the 10 leaning toward the Republican. For all Democratic candidates, the president's approval rating slide also creates daily press headaches. They don't have to just manage the association with the unpopular politician, they have to answer for whatever policies are making the president unpopular. What do you think about the NSA, IRS, and Benghazi? To distance themselves from an unpopular president, candidates may feel compelled to call for special prosecutors or the production of records, which only breathes more life into an already bad news cycle. According to members of the Bush and Clinton years, low approval ratings act like gravel on the road, making everything bumpier. ""Members of Congress use approval ratings when determining if they should or should not support the president's agenda,"" says Dan Bartlett, former counselor to George W. Bush. ""The lower the number, the more political freedom they believe they have."" Mark Penn, who was Bill Clinton's pollster and top strategist during his re-election and second term makes a similar point about the ""Rule of 50."" ""The Rule of 50 is the minute [your approval rating] falls below 50, everybody piles on you and before you know it you're at 38, 35, because it becomes to the political advantage for everyone to whack you,"" he said recently. ""And the minute you're above 50, everybody has to think twice about whacking you, and so you can actually build capital up."" Matthew Dowd, George W. Bush's former pollster, says Obama is facing the kind of permanent break that Bush faced in his second term. It's not just that Obama's approval ratings are down that's a problem, says Dowd, the important point is that people see him as less honest and trustworthy than they once did after the spate of recent controversies. ""Once you lose 'honest and trustworthy' and credibility, which is also what happened to George Bush, people start to say, 'I don't trust this guy on anything.' Once your gut connection on values cracks, there's no getting it back. ... My guess is that wherever Obama's number settles, barring some big external event, it won't get above that."" Preliminary evidence suggests that people are no longer giving the president the benefit of the doubt. In a CNN poll last month, only 37 percent of the public thought that the IRS controversy led to the White House, now 47 percent think it does. If people had more faith in the president's honesty, perhaps they would instinctively assume he's blameless, thinking he could never do such a thing. Health care may be the issue where the president's slide in the polls matters the most. The Affordable Care Act is the president's signature legislative achievement and its implementation is the president's No. 1 priority for his second term, according to aides. The administration and the president's political arm, Organizing for America, are engaged in a monthslong effort to encourage voters to sign up for the program. Senior Democratic senators have encouraged the White House to use the president more in this effort. If his standing with the public is diminished, it will make that hard sell harder. If younger voters don't sign up, costs might balloon as only the chronically ill join the program. It has become a feature of the modern presidency that every second-term president has to defend against a crisis born in their first term. This hampers his ability to achieve new things. For President Obama, the risk of low approval ratings is that they may diminish his ability to protect what he has already achieved."	Does It Matter if Obama's Second-Term Polls Numbers Are Down?

Worries that the Syrian civil war was destabilizing the region didn't move him. Nor did the increased involvement of Hezbollah. This week, former President Bill Clinton (in his own uniquely colorful way) said Obama should act. Now, the president is moving. In a brisk escalation of the U.S. involvement in Syria, the United States will provide military aid to rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad. The move, we are told, came after U.S. intelligence determined that the Syrian regime has deployed chemical weapons, resulting in up to 150 deaths. The understandable question presents itself: Why are 150 deaths the tipping point when nearly 93,000 were not? White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes explained that by using chemical weapons, Syria has violated international norms. Remember the norms! That is not exactly a rallying cry, but if the United States one day finds itself bogged down in Syria, it is the one the administration has chosen. There is always a tension in foreign policy between its inherent messiness, which keeps presidents from taking action, and the clean and clear justifications used to explain action once they decide to take it. We're seeing that play out now in Syria. The confusion results from the fact that foreign policy is calculus, which is about change and complexity, but presidents have to make it seem like algebra, which is about orderly operations. The press exacerbates the tension, too. Bill Clinton's remarks were written up as a sharp critique of Obama, but when you look at what Clinton was saying, it was actually very measured. ""Sometimes it's just best to get caught trying,"" said Clinton, ""as long as you don't overcommit--like, as long as you don't make an improvident commitment."" Not getting caught making an ""improvident commitment"" was exactly what Obama was worried about. Obama highlighted this tension between calculus and algebra in his most famous comments about Syria's chemical weapon stockpiles. He said Assad's use of chemical weapons would constitute crossing a ""red line."" The term has a specific meaning. When a red line is crossed, something happens. That's what administration officials are claiming has happened--Assad went too far, and Obama is taking action. But the president's original comments were never so black and white: ""We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus. That would change my equation."" (You can tell a president is not trying to be clear when he starts talking backward: ""a red line for us is ... "") The algebraic formulation would be that if Assad used chemical weapons, the United States would retaliate. That would have been too much, so instead the president invoked calculus. There were loopholes. What constitutes a ""whole bunch"" of chemical weapons? The president also never promised what would happen after the line was crossed, only that the president would change his ""calculus."" The president's remarks were probably a bluff meant to keep Assad from launching a massive chemical attack. Now that Assad has tested Obama's resolve, we're learning what a relatively small-scale attack triggers. But we're not learning much. Despite the administration saying that a red line has been crossed, there is a good deal of vagueness about what is going to happen. Rhodes said he would not lay out the administration's next steps in specific detail. There may be legitimate reasons for this secrecy (more calculus), but it highlights another reason you shouldn't talk about foreign policy like arithmetic. Even the very idea that the president is now taking military action to support the rebels is a bit of a dodge because it has been an open secret for a while that CIA and military personnel are in Syria helping train rebels and making sure weapons get to the right resistance fighters, as opposed to the radicals or those affiliated with al-Qaida. The next move will be reported (or leaked) soon enough. Then the public will start to determine whether the violation of norms justified whatever action the president ordered. The president has already confronted this complexity in Libya, where he tried to justify intervention to a war-weary nation on the basis of norms. In that instance, the president said that the international community had the responsibility to intervene when a state fails to protect its population from mass atrocities. The president described protecting the innocent in Libya as an American value. And allowing Qaddafi to massacre his people would have ""stained the conscience of the world."" But he added a second variable to the equation--the United States was taking action in Libya because it had the unique military capability to do so. In Syria, it doesn't look like the president is going to add that second element; his advisers say he has ruled out boots on the ground or a no-fly zone (although that may be slipping, too). For now, norms will have to do. The problem with using norms as a pretext for action is that norms are inherently slippery. They shift and move by design. The application of norms is selective and contingent on the political context. Usually what we want is an explanation of why acting is in our national interest. The problem is that the president appears to have shot down all the other good reasons to intervene. When you're justifying your actions on nothing more than norms, you're already in a weak place. When you don't admit it and try to use those very norms to sell your policy, you're in an even weaker place."

The other party was ""weak"" on national security, wasn't it? It wasn't so committed to ""fighting terror,"" was it? So Democrats in some close races were confronted with spooky-scary terrorism TV ads. The classic, by general agreement, was the spot run against Democrat Chris Murphy by incumbent Connecticut Republican Rep. Nancy Johnson. With imagery purloined from direct-to-DVD thrillers, the ad asked voters to consider whether they'd vote for a Democrat who questioned the National Security Agency's program of tracking calls. ""A terrorist plot may be unfolding,"" huffed the narrator. ""Should the government intercept that call or wait until the paperwork is filed? Nancy Johnson says, 'Act immediately. Lives may be at stake.' "" Republicans loved that ad. Washington Post race-watcher Chris Cillizza called it one of the 10 best spots of the 2006 cycle. ""Interestingly,"" he added, ""though this ad was cited as one of the cycle's best by numerous operatives of both partisan stripes, one GOP strategist noted that Johnson's numbers actually went down after the spot aired."" Yep. Johnson was felled in a 12-point landslide, in a district where only 1,112 votes had separated George W. Bush from John Kerry. Today, the strategists who worked on that ad shrug at the results--it was a bad year. Murphy, now the junior senator from Connecticut, knows the ad backfired. ""The central argument of the campaign against me in 2006 was my opposition to Bush's wiretapping program,"" he says. ""I voted against the extension of the Patriot Act provisions that authorized a lot of what we're talking about today. I've always been a skeptic of giving government too much power when it comes to data."" But who isn't a skeptic? The loneliest politician in Washington this week is the one who will stand straight and defend the NSA's PRISM program. The sherpas of the House and Senate Intelligence committees, people like Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, have sworn to reporters that the program didn't sweep innocent people into the dragnet. They're not quite rushing to defend it. House Speaker John Boehner uttered a fairly strong endorsement at his weekly presser--""These programs have helped keep America safe""--but behind his back, he tried to toss the buck back to President Obama. ""Frankly, I'm a little surprised that the White House hasn't stood up and made clear on an ongoing basis over the last week just how important these programs are."" There you go: That's as much rhetorical support as Congress is going to give right now. Even if the House and Senate leave the NSA's programs untouched, the new paranoia is a welcome return to norms. The post-9/11 Republican thrill for security schemes had a little to do with the power of the defense industry (which has yet to suffer from this scandal) and a lot to do with politics. There's a Democrat in the White House now. The men and women who make up the Republican base already assumed he was tracking their behavior, softening them up for death panels. That was the gist of Thursday's marquee bout of NSA-shaming, when Sen. Rand Paul brought a half-dozen House Republicans together with civil liberties groups to announce plans for some sort of lawsuit. ""Following up on the heels of the IRS scandal and other things, where information was used to persecute political enemies, this should be scaring everyone,"" said Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert. ""If my liberal friends who don't think it's that big a deal would just think--what if someone who's radically conservative, way to the right of me, you don't think if this isn't stopped, they'll come after liberals?"" He was describing the fears liberals had first, years ago. As long as there's been a Patriot Act Section 215, liberals have worried that the definitions of ""relevance"" and ""electronic surveillance"" would apply to left-wing groups. Now conservatives are convinced they'll apply to right-wing groups, so even the defenders of the Bush-era programs are feeling nihilistic. There are really three schools of nihilism. The first: Obama's the problem. In this scenario, the security state could function well enough if an Alinskyite wasn't at the top. ""The real danger to me,"" said Rush Limbaugh this week, ""is not one or two rogue employees at the IRS or the NSA or the CIA. The real danger is having a rogue administration. And we do."" The second school says Obama lost his way. In this scenario, a president who used to agree with civil libertarians succumbed to spy-creep. ""Six years ago, President Obama told us there were no shortcuts when it came to keeping America safe,"" mourned Rep. Mick Mulvaney on Thursday. ""He was right. I'm confused then as to why the president's chosen to take the mother of all shortcuts right through our personal information."" And the third, most powerful school believes we were lied to all along. Gohmert, who typically makes headlines for embarrassing himself during hearings or floor speeches, was in a mea culpa mood at Paul's lawsuit shindig on Thursday. He'd been a freshman congressman in 2005, during the first Patriot Act renewal. ""I was really troubled about sections 206 and 215, really had concerns about it. The day before our full committee took it up, all of us that wanted sunsets got calls from the administration, the DOJ, people in committee, saying, 'Here, we'll give you this, just drop the sunsets. You can trust the Justice Department. You can trust Homeland Security.' We had all the assurances, you don't have to worry."" Gohmert shook his head. ""They said they were not doing the very things they were doing. They said if you were not calling foreign terrorists, you had nothing to worry about. I've even used that line on the House floor."" Is this the full-on mainstream GOP position? Not yet. It's just the popular position. It's what the base thinks. Clip and save those old ads bragging about how much Republicans backed America's spies, because you won't see their like again. Read more on Slate about the NSA's secret snooping programs."

On Tuesday, the first long workday since the 29-year-old National Security Agency whistle-blower blurted out his identify, the senator from South Carolina told reporters what was wrong with Snowden and his type, and how to fix it. ""There's a group of people, younger people not fighting the war--libertarians mostly--who feel like the government is a threat,"" said Graham. ""[That] those who try to defend us are a bigger threat than those who are trying to attack us."" How do you root them out? ""When you catch 'em, you put 'em in jail."" Well, why hadn't Snowden been spooked by the lengthy jailing and delayed trial of WikiLeak-er Bradley Manning? ""He hasn't been sentenced yet. If Bradley Manning gets sentenced in a serious way, it might make somebody like Edward Snowden act differently. Deterrence works. If somebody finally goes to jail for destroying our national security and weakening our defenses, maybe the next guy will think twice."" For Graham, stopping leaks could be a matter of stopping ""the next guy"" who leaks. For the rest of Snowden's critics, that makes a heap of sense. Snowden, like Manning, is easy to classify as an oddball who developed an unhealthy distrust for his government. Manning partied with hackers; Snowden donated to Ron Paul. Manning impressed nobody as a soldier; Snowden didn't even complete his service. ""I'm just stunned that an individual who did not even have a high school diploma, who did not successfully complete his military service, and who is only age 29, had access to some of the most classified information in our government,"" said Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican who joined the intelligence committee this year. ""It suggests real problems with the vetting process. It's troubling to me that I've heard his salary was something like $200,000--for a high school drop-out who had little maturity."" As long as the focus stays on Snowden, the story can be controlled. It can end up like every other frenzy about the security state, the over-classification of secrets, the kudzu spread of ""top secret clearances."" It can be sidetracked by the silly discussion over whether members of Congress, who have to keep their NSA info downloads to themselves, can ""really have a public debate."" It can end up nowhere. Washington has gotten incredibly good at going nowhere. Snowden's revelations weren't on the level of Manning's. They were shocking because a program similar to existing programs that hadn't been classified was kept secret, known only to the one-in-200 Americans who have top-level security clearances. The best pocket history of over-classification is probably this 2011 report from the Brennan Center, which paid rare tribute to all the blue-ribbon groups that responded to scandals by recommending a looser approach to secrets. This has got to be a pattern. You had the 9/11 Commission, which warned that ""current security requirements nurture over-classification and excessive compartmentalization of information among agencies."" You had the 1997 Moynihan Commission, and its admonition that the ""classification system ... is used too often to deny the public an understanding of the policymaking."" The Brennan team vroomed the DeLorean all the way back to 1956, when a Defense Department committee warned of how ""over-classification has reached serious proportions."" This was five years before the president was born in Hawaii. That president has combined some facile moves toward declassification--a few executive orders, mostly--with a highly secretive security strategy. ""Let's take the drone program,"" said Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat who won his first congressional race after being hit for opposing the NSA's last round of wiretapping. ""I'm very supportive of reports that the administration is going to move the Pakistani drone program away from the CIA into the Department of Defense, where less information will be classified and more public debate can occur. The administration shouldn't have as much trepidation as they do about having a more open debate."" Helpfully, on Tuesday, a group of mostly Democratic senators introduced a bill that could declassify some documents. Led by Oregon's Sen. Jeff Merkley and Utah's Sen. Mike Lee, they've resurrected an 2012 amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that would declassify ""significant"" opinions by FISA courts. One problem: The old amendment only got 37 votes. ""What's different now is that people are, understandably, really concerned about this thing,"" explained Lee. ""There has been a pretty public example of why people ought to be concerned about this law that gives the government all this kind of power."" That might be true. Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, who opposed that amendment, said he was still thinking about the new bill. ""I opposed the Patriot Act from the beginning,"" he said. ""I think this illustrates some of the problems. But I need to think this through. We need to look at the number of contractors, how much of this is contracted, how many people have access to this, why this guy makes $200,000 a year in taxpayer dollars."" If everyone's angry about the money Snowden made and the access he got, how do you curtail that? If there are 500,000 private contractors with top clearances, do you slice into their numbers? ""Within the NSA,"" said Lindsey Graham, ""you could create an internal affairs division like police departments have, where their job is to watch the system ... we may want to ask a few people to do more because we don't want to expand the circle of knowledge."" Expand it to who, though? Graham, who insists that ""the world is a battlefield"" and terrorists are on the other side, wondered whether there might be some way of predicting who'd go rogue. ""When I was a young captain in the Air Force,"" he said, ""getting clearance was: 'Have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?' Remember those old questions? In the Cold War, they wanted to know if you've ever joined the enemy. I don't remember being asked if you've ever been a member of al-Qaida or the Taliban, and I don't know if we want to do that, but when it comes to limiting the amount of people that have access to these programs we need to think long and hard about the need to know, and keep it as small as possible. One thing we've learned from this is that we've gotten sloppy."""	Can Congress Force the Executive Branch to Part With Some of Its Secrets?	['Paul', 'Merkley']	[]
13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/06/darrell_issa_and_republican_party_s_irs_investigations_the_gop_has_broad.html	"Ever since the Obama administration ran aground on a series of scandals, Republicans have been trying hard to go from zero to Watergate. No matter how hard they stomp on the accelerator, the car won't go. On the left, there is a similar desire to go from zero to McCarthy. The main target: Rep. Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, who has been investigating the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, and the Internal Revenue Service targeting conservative groups. On Sunday, Issa called White House spokesman Jay Carney a ""paid liar,"" in keeping with the Republican congressman's general temperament, which is to accuse first and find the facts later. Democrats are trying to promote the idea that Republicans are overplaying their hand with these controversies. Several times, analysts have raised the specter of the 1990s House Republicans who took their party over the cliff with mad passion in the investigations of Bill Clinton. Republicans have not overplayed their hand. Unlike the late 1990s, they have the country with them in their pursuit of answers. Americans want to get to the bottom of the IRS mess, the issue that has prompted some of Issa's extravagancies. New revelations, like this week's disclosures about IRS profligacy, are offering fresh reasons for outrage, and the disciplining of two IRS officials for receiving gifts against ethics rules ratifies the investigations. New polls show that the country thinks the president is less trustworthy, so the chances the public will rush to his defense against the meanies going after him is shrinking. First, a little history: In 1998, Dan Burton, Issa's Republican predecessor as chairman of the Oversight Committee, said, ""If I could prove 10 percent of what I believe happened [about Bill Clinton], he'd be gone. This guy's a scumbag. That's why I'm after him."" That's a lot worse than saying mean things about Jay Carney. Sen. Harry Reid once called President George Bush a liar. Rep. Joe Wilson yelled, ""You lie!"" during President Barack Obama's State of the Union address. Issa has some distance to go before he reaches the current standard for bruising words. Burton once shot a watermelon in his back yard as a part of some home investigation into a dramatic theory he had about the suicide of Clinton White House aide Vince Foster. When you're shooting the fruit, that's overreach. If Issa starts going in for the gourds, we can reassess. The notion of overreach is based on the idea that Republicans will get so nutty that they will turn off voters in the 2014 election. Since that will be a nonpresidential year, the chance for overreach is already diminished. The electorate is likely to be filled with far more politically active voters. Die-hards have a greater tolerance for partisan circus acts. Still, you can go too far. There are two dangers: You either inspire the other side's partisans to mobilize, or you present yourself as such a menace to the citizenry that you scare voters who might sit out the election, and they go to the polls to vote you out. The IRS scandal isn't likely to encourage either of these outcomes. The public seems to think the matter is worth pursuing. Fifty-eight percent surveyed in a recent Bloomberg poll say Congress is spending the right amount of time on the investigation or should spend more. Forty-three percent of those surveyed in a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll said IRS scrutiny of conservative groups was part of a widespread effort by those in government, compared with 29 percent who saw it as a case of a few officials acting on their own. Even 63 percent of Democrats want an independent prosecutor to investigate the IRS abuses. When it comes to other scandals, the public seems to think there's enough smoke there, too. In a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll respondents were asked separately about Benghazi, the IRS scandal, and the Justice Department's monitoring of journalists, and in each case at least 55 percent said the incident raised doubts about ""the overall honesty and integrity of the Obama administration."" In January, self-described independents gave Obama high marks for being ""honest and straightforward."" Now only 27 percent do. According to a recent Bloomberg poll, 47 percent of Americans say they don't believe Obama is telling the truth when he says he didn't know the IRS was giving extra scrutiny to conservative groups. (Forty percent say he is being truthful). In a nonpresidential election year where base motivation is even more important, the IRS investigations offer perhaps the greatest opportunity for Republicans to score free points in the history of politics. Grassroots Tea Party activists are invited to Washington to tell their stories of harassment and discrimination, and even Democrats have to tell them how wronged they were. Republicans can baste their supporters in love and vindication. Tea Party members have had their specific fears about government targeting ratified, and this week they're getting more validation for their broader view about government bloat. An IRS inspector general's report out this week catalogued roughly $50 million spent on agency conferences, with loose attention to cost in some cases. High-profile items in the report included $17,000 to hire an artist to paint portraits of Michael Jordan and Bono and $50,000 to produce videos that included a Star Trek parody. The long-term danger for Chairman Issa may not be overreach but ineffectiveness. When you overhype evidence, people will notice if you don't have the goods, and ultimately you lose credibility. But we are a long way from that. Right now, the public wants Republicans to make their case."

That sounds banal. But it hasn't always been the case. In fact, some years ago I heard a curious story about a potential low-level political appointee at the State Department who needed a favor from a Democratic Party bigwig. The problem with the potential appointee was political, not substantive. You see, he'd been an Obama supporter from the early going. In other times or in other administrations that might have been an asset. But in a State Department headed by Hillary Clinton and staffed by her political loyalists, premature Obama support was a liability. Things got smoothed over, and naturally over the years tensions between Obama and Hillary supporters greatly muted. Still, for much of the first term there was a striking absence of Obama people in the national security apparatus. The financial collapse of 2008 and the horrendous recession of 2009 have tended to obscure the fact that Obama's presidential campaign was initially very heavily focused on foreign policy issues. There were few substantive disagreements between Obama and Clinton in the 2008 primaries, but there was a big gap in their Iraq records. Clinton--joined by most of the Democratic foreign policy establishment--had backed the resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq sought by George W. Bush. Obama, at the time a state senator with a liberal district in Chicago, spoke out against the war. He was joined in his campaign by many younger Democratic staffers who were energized by the war issue. Of that group, probably the most senior was Rice, an assistant secretary of state in the Clinton administration who'd also backed Howard Dean's anti-war insurgency in 2008. The most high-profile was Power, a celebrated author and journalist. And the dispute between the camps--both visibly between the candidates and behind the scenes on a staffer-to-staffer level--was quite vehement, with many Obama supporters warned that their careers would be ruined when their man lost. Except he didn't lose. The problem was that by the time he took office, other things were more pressing than pursuing old intra-party feuds. Getting Clinton out of the Senate and into the administration was smart strategy. But that meant a high-profile prestige gig like secretary of state, rather than something low-profile like Health and Human Services where there was no legacy of disagreement. The simultaneous decision to retain George W. Bush's defense secretary, the old-line realist Robert Gates, to offer a patina of bipartisan cover for withdrawal from Iraq was also smart. But Gates, like Clinton, asked for and received the right to name his own subordinates. Then Obama picked the apolitical former Gen. James Jones as national security adviser. Again, this was a move with some real logic behind it. Jones' presence lent credibility to a young and untested commander in chief with the military establishment. But in combination with the other two choices--and paired with the fact that like all new presidents, Obama inherited his predecessors' choices of which admirals and generals held the various four-star roles--it created a dearth of Obama supporters in the Obama administration. Instead of Cabinet secretaries with their long staff tails, there was Rice at the United Nations and a small number of influential National Security Council staffers--Denis McDonough, Power, Tommy Vietor, Ben Rhodes--with relationships with the president. And so it largely remained even as Gates and Jones were replaced by Leon Panetta and Tom Donilon, both veteran Democrats with no particular ties to Obama. Now things are different. With McDonough as chief of staff, two senators with close personal relationships with Obama running the departments of state and defense, Rice as national security adviser, and Power prepared to accept a senior public facing role we're looking at the team that Obama probably would have wanted all along absent other considerations. What that means exactly for policy is difficult to say. The principals involved have a range of perspectives, as is customary and healthy in a team. But it's reasonably likely to make some kind of difference. Structural factors typically drive second-term presidents to more personal engagement with national security questions. And if Obama does want to throw himself in a big way into a national security issue--whether that's an intervention in Syria, a renewed push for a deal between Israel and Palestine, or something elsewhere--he now has the team in place to do it.

15	15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/07/eliot_spitzer_running_for_new_york_comptroller_why_spitzer_anthony_weiner.html	"Tedium is the scandalized politician's best friend. When the frenzy begins, you can hardly remember the color of your lawn beneath those cameras, satellite trucks, and well-coifed correspondents. Being a frenzy, it doesn't last: You resign. The story gets forgotten. You reach a tipping point, eventually, when more people seem to ask why you resigned than had ever asked you to quit. Can you come back? Hey, how can you not come back? Mark Sanford and Anthony Weiner slogged through this multistep recovery plan, and on Sunday Eliot Spitzer announced he would join them. He's decided to run for New York City comptroller after meditating on it in Central Park, and just four days before he needs to turn in 3,725 signed ballot petitions. He's joined the race with a round of skeptical-but-friendly interviews and an outdoor, boiling hot press conference where he shrugged off a heckler. ""I've got skin as thick as a rhinoceros,"" he said. ""I love the screaming. I love the shouting. What I love most of all is doing things for the public."" That came off like pablum, but for a very select group of people it was a little sad. Not long after he resigned the governor's office in March 2008, Spitzer became a columnist for Slate. He was good at it, but he viewed it, not too secretly, as a penance. With him gone, with Henry Blodget long gone, I'm the only Slate reporter who knows what it's like to endure a media firestorm, resign from a job, and wait out the wailing mobs. It's a useful learning experience, though I'd recommend avoiding it. To recap: In January 2009, after moving from the libertarian Reason to the left-leaning Washington Independent, I was invited to join an extant liberal listserv called JournoList. Founded by Ezra Klein, purportedly off the record, it sprung leaks when its members went particularly rough on people they didn't like. In March 2010, I was hired by the Washington Post to cover the conservative movement, while on the List I was cracking wise (and occasionally cruelly--I joked about a guy's heart attack?) about some of the people on that beat. In June 2010, two outlets published a collection of my choicest insults. I offered to resign on a Thursday; the resignation was accepted 12 hours later, after more emails were released. That was around four times as fast as Eliot Spitzer's scandal-to-resignation timeline, and 24 times faster than Anthony Weiner's. Like Spitzer, and unlike Weiner, I never denied the charges. But of course I didn't. This was 2010--who'd buy ""I got hacked"" as a cover story? There's no real transitive property of scandals--sex isn't emails (or even TwitPics), Governor Elected by the Great People of This State is a loftier job than reporter-blogger. There is a recognizable pattern in how the media ingests and digests these stories. If it's about a personal failing, and not some graft or waste of public funds, the scandal becomes a morality play. Who feels good at the end of a morality play? A bad actor who's been caught is a villain, but the moment he loses, he's a tragic villain. This is the curse of the ""narrative."" Joan Didion, a reliable enemy of ""the narrative,"" has identified how its makers ""overlook the observable in the interests of obtaining a dramatic story line."" Hubris is dramatic, and so is pathos, so if a scandal brings you down you know what your next role's got to be. That's if you want to stay in the industry. A good number of the last decade's scandalized politicians moved on completely. Former Indiana Rep. Mark Souder and New York Rep. Eric Massa resigned, did a little media clean-up (""I'm sick of politicians who drag their spouses up in front of the cameras,"" said Souder), then quit public life. Former New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey became a divinity student and prison counselor, avoiding politics, though he did re-engage with media in a documentary with the editorialized title of Fall to Grace. But Sanford, Weiner, and Spitzer wanted back into politics. I wanted back into reporting. Once you quit, you realize that they beat you, and ... well, wasn't that supposed to be the worst thing that could ever happen? You used to have a secret, now you don't. You've got to endure something painful, but is it a walk through a punishing desert or a meditation in a high-end red-rocks sauna? You get to choose. Back in 2010, I tried to be contrite, apologizing to the people I'd insulted then figuring out whether I could still be trusted as a reporter. It turned out that I could, because no one was really comfortable with the idea of profane emails blacklisting you from politics. I really was sorry, and the people I talked to were either sorry or confused that there was a scandal at all. Once they'd beaten me, critics revealed that they didn't know what else to do. I puzzled at ""confirmed"" lists of JournoList members (some of them were never members) and realized that opinion on the scandal had pretty much settled. You either had proof for all time of how the media worked, or you didn't care. Sanford, Weiner, and Spitzer must have realized something similar. When I covered Sanford this year, he said (more than once) that he didn't really appreciate grip-and-grabs with voters until he'd been disgraced. Now he saw it as a ""blessing""--people knew his darkest secret, and they wanted photos with him anyway! Weiner's reflections to a New York Times profile writer suggested that he only faltered because, darn it, he cared too much. ""I was in a world and a profession that had me wanting people's approval,"" he said. ""By definition, when you are a politician, you want people to like you, you want people to respond to what you're doing, you want to learn what they want to hear so you can say it to them."" Sanford, Weiner, and Spitzer believe in their new personas. Their new, post-scandal, open-collar and confession personas are much stronger than the pol-with-a-secret images that were ripped away. The haters, having won, stopped caring about them; the only people they heard from were fans. Paradoxically, trading their old and complicated narratives for ""comeback kid"" narratives really does make them stronger than the average candidate. If they had shame, you'd never have heard their names in the first place."	What My Scandal Taught Me About Eliot Spitzer, Anthony Weiner, and Mark Sanford	['Sanford']	[]
16	16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/07/setting_a_progressive_agenda_for_the_future.html	"On Monday we set off a tiny firestorm by asking what is left for the progressive movement after the gay rights victory at the Supreme Court. We wanted to provoke a conversation: What should progressives be for, both to make the world a better place and win elections? We have our own thoughts--you're about to get a taste--but the object of the exercise is to ask for yours, too. Send them to us at progressiveideas2013@gmail.com. We believe there should not, and does not have to be, a choice between being progressive and winning elections. This country once loved a challenge; it aspired to greatness (rather than just bragging about it), even--or especially--when it meant personal sacrifice. Progressivism is just the idea that working together, often with and through government, we can make the world a better place. It once attracted sensible people across party lines, as forward-thinking agendas will do. Franklin Roosevelt was progressive in this way, but so, too, was his Republican cousin Theodore. Harry Truman was definitely progressive, but so--shockingly so in some ways--could be Richard Nixon. The country stopped being progressive somewhere between the malaise of Jimmy Carter and the self-absorption of the Reagan era. Today, it's progressive to care for our children while enabling their parents to be productive members of the workforce. Child care--safe, socializing, affordable, educational child care--should be readily available to anyone who needs it. It doesn't matter if it is public or private or a public-private partnership, tax credits, whatever.  People will support it because affordable child care is good business and good for families, too. It's progressive to educate kids to be productive members of society. Forget the old, tired, tendentious debate about whether it is a federal or state responsibility (it's both), whether it's money or teachers that matter (it's both), whether minimum standards are necessary to achieve threshold levels of learning or squelch curricular creativity (it can be both). No one thinks our educational system is working; hammering the point that the United States is losing in the global economy because of it should attract support for fixing what is broken. Let's dedicate the next four years to doing for education what Congress and the president did for health care. It's not just educating our kids, but our adults, too. Those Rust Belt jobs and others on the slow boat to some developing country aren't coming back. The technological revolution is remarkably like the industrial revolution of a century earlier; the Progressive movement of the 1920s was born of the first revolution. Today's progressives can and should reboot themselves by embracing the reality of this one. Indeed--and here is a radical idea for what it means to be progressive--it's time to admit that four-year colleges are not for everyone. Remember vocational schools? The departed Rust Belt jobs that unions mourn weren't sexy, but they provided a solid income, enough to raise a family in a real middle class. Today many young people need not a degree from a pricey institution but training in booming areas like health care and tech that will allow them to raise their own families. We need to train people for jobs that exist. Training and jobs are things people can agree upon. Immigration is justifiably a cause progressives have stuck with. It's a crackpot notion to think that by locking down our borders and checking identification every time someone parallel parks, we can keep jobs from fleeing overseas. We also should quickly and dramatically reform our red-tape-filled work and tax laws, so ordinary households can employ immigrants and see they get the Social Security they deserve. Also progressive: getting off the bandwagon of trashing our liberties in the name of security, which has steamrolled once-cherished parts of our Constitution like the Fourth Amendment. The recent disclosures about the National Security Agency spying are only the latest in a long line, proving yet again what the Framers of our Constitution knew so well: that the people in power cannot be trusted to tell the truth or respect citizens' fundamental liberties. Each revelation of government spying clearly hits a national nerve, but then we are scared back into submission by threats that are not revealed. Certainly, no one explains how the spying is really helping catch the bad guys. The Constitution is not a suicide pact; we should do what we need to protect our security. But it is progressive to insist that government officials be forced to prove it to us, not simply talk in super secret generalities. It's also time for the federal government to back off and let states choose to legalize marijuana. The Hundred Years War on Drugs is a failure and a national embarrassment. Fighting it has caused us to throw away other parts of the Bill of Rights while incarcerating or pinning criminal records on tens of millions of Americans. We've made a worthless weed so valuable that entire governments south of us cannot maintain basic civil order because of the terrorist tactics the profits to drug cabals fuel. And for what? The data suggests the country has spent a fortune, destroyed countless lives, and failed to reduce drug consumption. If some states want to, shall we say, experiment, they should be allowed to do so. It's called federalism. It can be popular, too. Relatedly, we need to reform a prison system that warehouses and often brutalizes a population of young men, filling the pockets of those who build them and securing the jobs of those who work in them. It makes no sense that in the land of the free, one of the things we do best is incarcerate people. The gap between the rich and the poor in America grows every year. It's a new Gilded Age in which Americans work harder than ever and earn less money. Progressivism followed the original Gilded Age. Occupy Wall Street was an inspiration, one that we regret didn't go further. We're all for the incentives provided by the capitalist system; they've made this country great. But we're equally well aware of the perils of market dysfunction and rampant greed. Drastic, breathtaking inequality--inequality that even many wealthy today regret--has never been a prescription for long-term social success. Progressives should make the case for addressing this without looking to alienate the upper reaches of the income scale. It's also progressive to care for a planet. This is about committing to protecting scarce resources, even if it means slowing our rabid consumption. We should stick to a green strategy, rather than tucking tail and running as soon as Republican candidates argue that drilling for oil is what America does best. We need to do so much more than we are doing to protect an environment degrading before our eyes. Progressives should understand that race is as fraught and complicated in America as it has ever been (notwithstanding our first African-American president and to some extent because of him). The conservative majority on the Supreme Court is wrong: We are not past race in America. Progressives can push for a color-blind future without blinding ourselves to the reality that we're not even close yet. Progressives also respect women by recognizing that violence against them in the military, in the media, in the workplace, and at school is pervasive and unacceptable. Before we condemn Africans and Egyptians for their treatment of women, we should ask ourselves why we can't do better here. Finally, there's voting. We've been headed in entirely the wrong direction. This includes state laws that make it too difficult to establish one's right to vote, the disenfranchisement of too many people for possessing drugs, and an outdated machinery for running elections that leaves us constantly on the brink of confused outcomes. This is a democracy; voting should be our priority. There is much more. This list is just a first cut. Although plenty of you ""liked"" our first piece about what's left on Facebook, it made some people angry, including our friends. That's OK, because we're angry as well. We tried to make clear that gay rights was a worthy cause and that we admired the people in the trenches who've been fighting for the longtime left agenda. But the country needs a broader agenda to aspire to, one that can make people feel greater than themselves. And we think elections can be won this way. Build it, and people will come. Like we said, those are our thoughts, but we really are curious about yours. So over this holiday weekend, sit with your kids and friends, read the Declaration of Independence, and come up with your own ideas to send us. We'll be back after the holiday to report in."

17	17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/07/eric_cantor_at_the_aspen_ideas_festival_immigration_tax_law_and_congressional.html	"ASPEN, Colo.--The name of the building was the ""Benedict Music Tent,"" which undersold it. Around 2,000 people can find seats in the structure, a kind of secular megachurch. When the Aspen Ideas Festival isn't in town, it hosts Lexus-smooth guitar-man musicians such as Ben Harper and Jackson Browne. On Saturday, it welcomed the rarest guest: a guy wearing a suit and tie. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor was comfortably out of place. His audience, wealthy people in colorful shorts, was largely happy that Barack Obama was president, largely convinced that climate change was the reason the greater Southwest was melting this week, and pretty well convinced that Congress needed to pass the Simpson-Bowles plan to save America. Some of them had been convinced of this by Simpson and Bowles themselves when they showed up in Aspen, sans ties. These people wanted Washingtonians to work together; National Review's Ramesh Ponnuru eased Cantor in by asking about his relationship with the president. ""The charm offensive that has been largely reported by most news outlets--one could look, to see, perhaps, some evidence that it exists,"" said Cantor. It was all right in the beginning, but ""what has since transpired is a success that has not yet been realized. From a personal perspective, what I can tell you is I don't feel I speak to the president enough to try and resolve differences and work problems out."" Good answer for this room--if only people talked to each other! And ever since Republicans lost the 2012 election, Cantor, more than any other member of its leadership, has worked to rebrand the party as an army of thought leaders who hear what you're saying. In a February speech at the American Enterprise Institute, Cantor identified crises in health care and immigration and tax law, insisting that ""colleagues in both chambers of Congress on both sides of the aisle have begun work in good faith to address these issues."" They never moved past the starting line. In April, House Republicans nixed a vote on a Cantor-backed Healthy Americans Act, an Obamacare tweak that would have created high-risk pools with the money now earmarked for preventive care. In June, Cantor joined conservative Republicans and backed an amendment to the farm bill that would have added work requirements for food stamp recipients. That amendment helped bring down the bill. Ponnuru mentioned some of this, but Cantor waved off the details. ""Every week we are passing legislation in the House, sending it to the Senate,"" he said. (""Sending"" is a nice way to put it--the bills, such as June's ""fetal pain"" legislation, are DOA.) When asked about immigration, Cantor insisted that his House really was working on the legislation, whatever the audience might have been told on NPR. ""There have already been five bills we've seen marked up in committee that will be sent to the floor,"" said Cantor. ""There was a bill that had to do with agricultural workers, guest workers who had to come to the country and have the ability to do so. A bill very relevant to some of the discussions here at Aspen about how do we encourage more skilled workers to be here, how do we finally get that 'staple the green card to the diploma' rule into law, so that we don't see highly skilled foreign nationals with Ph.D.s and master's degrees from our universities fleeing this country, taking their venture capital with them. And many other bills on employer enforcement, border enforcement, interior enforcement. And then we'll get to the very difficult issues that we've got to resolve. One of those I feel very passionately about, and that's the kids."" This was a revealing answer. Back in February, in his omnibus speech about a GOP that could ""make life work,"" Cantor mentioned the Aspen-friendly skilled-worker stuff, but he didn't say immigration reform would start there. ""A good place to start,"" he'd said, ""is with the kids."" He'd tried to be a thought leader, but the Republican conference wasn't led. It's tricky to read 2,000 minds at a conference, and there was no pollster stopping people between the David H. Koch Building and the Fuller Dome, but the elites weren't blown away by Cantor. Honestly, multiple people mentioned that he'd worn a full suit, and a subset of these people had expected to be more impressed. You can't walk out of a session on driverless cars and expect to be wowed by a lecture about how something as obvious as immigration reform can't pass. ""You want to hear a big idea?"" asked Obed Aboodi, a financier leaving a later session on ""What The Market Tells Us About the Economy."" Sure. Here's his idea: ""Get rid of the states. No states, no districts. If you elect politicians nationally, you don't have these sort of local politicians pandering and stopping progress."" But for now you do. On Sunday, a tie-less Cantor wearing a step-counting bracelet joined his second session, titled ""A Seismic Shift in Our Schools: College Prep, Career Readiness, and the Common Core Revolution."" In the states, Republicans are in open rebellion over the idea of national curriculum standards. That's not Cantor's problem, really, but on a panel of liberal education thinkers he had the least to say. Joel Klein would finish a stem-winder about the need for national standards; Cantor would follow him with something agreeable. ""Teachers should be a priority,"" he said. ""What about the teachers who aren't teaching? What about those who aren't doing the job? I have to believe there are contracts, there are agreements in place, that really restrict the ability for these leaders to be able to make sure that good teachers are there. We have to prioritize it, like Joel says, and we have to give the flexibility to the leadership in the states and the local school districts to make sure the good teachers are rewarded and the others are moved out."" This was pretty conservative, but totally separate from the sins of Congress. It got applause. ""Yes,"" said Lynda Resnick, the Aspen trustee moderating the panel. ""Amen!"" After the panel, as he cut a path to an interview about technology grants and the NSA scandal, I checked in to see whether Cantor was enjoying himself. He was outnumbered, definitely, and he didn't usually speak to audiences that could recite David Brooks columns in order. ""My whole takeaway here is they've gotta have more balance in Aspen,"" Cantor said. ""If they're really going to have an impact on the greater political environment across the country, they need to. This is a bit like an echo chamber."""	Eric Cantor Loses the Tent at the Aspen Ideas Festival	['Harper', 'Simpson', 'Obama']	[]
18	18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/06/texas_abortion_filibuster_and_wendy_davis_the_state_senator_has_revived.html	"Texas politics favors the theatrical. ""Pappy"" O'Daniel, the flour-milling Depression-era governor, won his position on the strength of his Western swing band. Texas Democrats idolize Ann Richards, the wise-cracking, tough-talking former governor and the last Democrat to hold the position. She was liberal, and she was a winner. Her ghost has totemic importance for Texas Democrats. For whatever reason--whether it be the state's historically ingrained imbalances of party power, or an emphasis on individualism that outstrips that of most other parts of the country--showmanship is virtually a requirement for political office. So when state Sen. Wendy Davis took to the Texas Senate floor Tuesday in pink tennis shoes for what would become a 10-hour talking filibuster to try to derail one of the most restrictive abortion bills in the country, she was drawing on a lengthy political tradition. But as the day went on--as the level of national attention grew, from President Obama to Judy Blume to the nearly 200,000 people who watched online as the midnight deadline loomed--it became clear that something was happening that was bigger than the bill itself. It was also something of a seance. And though Ann Richards' memory was summoned, the day animated a body much more moribund: the state Democratic Party of Texas. Gov. Perry has called a second special session to begin July 1, and, with less ability to deploy delaying tactics, Democrats expect that the abortion restrictions will pass this time around. But Davis' filibuster may still prove a pivotal moment, one which portends a political transition. More than temporarily killing a bill, Davis helped create on Tuesday night a founding mythology for the rebirth of the state's Democrats, a party that Davis may ultimately lead.

""It's kind of awakened the Democratic Party, which didn't really have a lot of lifeblood flowing through it,"" says Terrysa Guerra, a rising strategist in the state party. ""I see a tremendous amount of excitement. More than I've ever seen at any point in my career--even in 2008."" Davis, a longtime champion of Texas Democrats, has been profiled dozens of times in the last 24 hours. The child of a poor Fort Worth family, she was a divorced single mother by the age of 19. After putting herself through a two-year paralegal program at a nearby county college, she graduated first in her class from Texas Christian University. Then, Harvard Law, with honors. Charismatic, articulate, friendly, principled, and relentlessly driven, she's been one of the great hopes of her party, which hasn't won a statewide post in almost 15 years. Next year, Perry will likely relinquish the governor's mansion and prepare for a presidential run, and the Republican nominee to replace him will likely be Attorney General Greg Abbott, a man with hyperconservative social views, one of whose Twitter icons is himself with the stone statue of the Ten Commandments on the Capitol grounds. Also up for re-election is Sen. John Cornyn. Democrats have been desperately searching for competitive candidates for the 2014 cycle. Davis has--so far--declined. Many of the party's stronger candidates have shied away from the next cycle because they believe better circumstances will come by the end of the decade. Almost all discussion about Texas' increasingly competitive political balance has focused on the growing number of Latino voters. But there are a myriad of other factors Democrats will have to learn to exploit if they're to win. Texas is enjoying rapid immigration from other parts of the United States, especially California, and its urban areas, which shade blue, are experiencing explosive growth. But traditionally Democratic demographics turn out to vote at anemic levels. The Democratic coalition is a complicated one, and will require substantial investment in time and resources to put in order. But above all, it will require someone who can excite voters to jump in the water. Bill White, the party's technocratic gubernatorial candidate in 2010, was liked and respected as a moderate Houston mayor, but did a shade worse than Obama's 2008 performance. Davis' problems, were she to run for governor or senator, would be the same as all Democratic state candidates: name recognition, fundraising, lack of support from the national party. After Tuesday, those issues suddenly seem surmountable, thanks to miscalculation by the state's calcifying Republican establishment. The measure Davis filibustered, Senate Bill 5, would have essentially dismantled the institution of legal abortion in the state. Abortions would have been prohibited after 20 weeks, and abortion clinics would have been subjected to a raft of complicated regulations aimed, supporters said, to protect the health of the mother. They include requirements that abortion doctors have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their clinic, and that all abortions, even drug-induced ones, take place within the confines of facilities built to surgical standards.

Opponents argued that the regulations were medically unnecessary and a thinly-veiled attempt to close clinics. They pointed out--and Republican Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst gleefully acknowledged--that only five of the state's 42 clinics, all in major cities, would remain open if the bill was passed. A woman living in El Paso, for example, who sought an abortion in Texas, would have to travel some 600 miles to San Antonio. Once there, thanks to laws passed in 2011, she would also have to receive a sonogram, and wait 24 hours in the city before undergoing the procedure and returning home, a round-trip almost half the width of the United States. This, opponents of the bill said, would pose an unsurpassable burden to poor women living in rural areas.

Other states, such as Arkansas and North Dakota, have passed laws which contain more restrictive provisions. But Texas' bill, because of the state's size and the sheer number of women affected, would have been one of the most consequential in the country, and pro-choice groups started mobilizing against it immediately. More than 700 people signed up to testify against the bill at a committee hearing. Dozens of Democrats in the House and Senate masterfully slow-rolled the bill, taking up crucial time. It didn't help that Gov. Perry, expecting a glide path through the legislature, only opened abortion up for debate halfway through a special 30-day session, leaving his legislative allies without much room for error.

""It's a reflection of arrogance and incompetence,"" says longtime state Democratic strategist Matt Angle. ""You have a governor who's really not paying attention to the issues in his state, and didn't realize it would be this unpopular."" There's a pervasive sense of complacency, he says, in the state's Republican establishment. And it's easy to understand why--Dewhurst, Perry, and Perry's probable successor Abbott have each held their current positions for a decade or more. The state GOP, for the most part, floats unmolested from victory to victory. This has, perhaps, made the Texas GOP susceptible to political overreach, and that unpreparedness was front and center during the last few days of the session. The bill's House sponsor, state Rep. Jodie Laubenberg, proved woefully uninformed when she suggested that rape kits allowed women to ""get cleaned out,"" eliminating the possibility of pregnancy, drawing widespread national mockery. Eventually she refused to answer questions about the bill before the House.

Many factors slowed SB5's progression, but it was Davis who seized the chance to take the floor on the last day, and she who got the lion's share of attention and credit. After more than 10 hours, during which she read witness testimony from women who opposed the bill, Republicans in the Senate cut her off, citing arcane legislative rules that may have been improperly applied. With nearly 200,000 people watching on one livestream, Davis remained standing, silent, while her fellow Democrats attempted to tie a Gordian knot of parliamentary delaying tactics so convoluted it might not be unwound for the hour remaining in the session. But Senate Republicans sliced through them, ignoring motions and inquiries from the floor. With 15 minutes to go till midnight, Democratic state Sen. Leticia Van De Putte, who had arrived in the chamber fresh from her father's funeral in south Texas, asked the chair: ""At what point must a female senator raise her hand or her voice to be recognized over her male colleagues?""

That was all the prompting the packed gallery needed to erupt. A solid wall of sound drowned out the final events of the night, confusing even the senators on the floor. A vote was held, but the clerk's records reflected that the vote had concluded after midnight--past the constitutional deadline. An attempt was made to alter the timestamps--it's unclear by whom--but the Senate eventually relented. It took several hours for Dewhurst to admit the vote failed.

Given that the bill was supported by overwhelming majorities in both chambers, it was a spectacular symbolic victory for the pro-choice side. After the vote concluded, Davis appeared in the capitol rotunda with some of the thousands of pro-choice protesters. Standing there with her was Cecile Richards--the president of Planned Parenthood, and, as it happens, Ann Richards' daughter. Richards and Planned Parenthood proved instrumental in helping to encourage the public turnout, and the victory was in many ways hers to share with Davis. Gov. Ann Richards' official portrait, which oversaw the protests in the frequently crowded rotunda, became a source of fascination for the pro-choice demonstrators. Some tweeted pictures of their daughters in front of the portrait, and others imagined her running commentary from the afterlife. In the Taiwanese animation of the filibuster, Ann Richards appears as a green, floating ghost that hovers over Davis' podium. ""Ann Richards is still the hero of the party,"" says Guerra, the Democratic strategist. ""She's the standard by which we compare future governors to. I think Wendy Davis meets that test easily. And it's about creating a link between the women of the state, mothers and daughters. That's almost a sacred thing."" Matt Mackowiak, a conservative strategist who expressed his frustration with Republicans for giving Davis the space ""to become a star,"" throws some cold water on Davis' anointment. Texas, he says, is still an overwhelmingly pro-life state. While the filibuster may have drilled a wellspring of support from the state's liberal base, it was over an issue that doesn't build broad political support. ""She seized this moment. You've got to give her credit for that,"" he said. ""But do I think this is going to fundamentally change politics in Texas? I don't."" Still, he cedes, the situation has ""created a viable statewide candidate in Wendy Davis."" Guerra, though, points to Davis' experience in her state Senate district, where she fended off a tough Republican challenge in a district that voted against Obama by no small margin, and her past advocacy on behalf of funds for public education, which has been cut dramatically in recent years. ""In the 2012 election in Fort Worth,"" she said ""we saw a lot of Anglo women who voted for Romney but were willing to jump the ticket and vote for Davis. That's an incredible strength. Republicans in this state will go to seemingly any length to alienate women voters. The best thing they can do now is keep their mouth shut. But I don't see any indication they're going to do that."" Now that Gov. Perry's put abortion back on the call for a new special session, it doesn't seem likely. Meanwhile, in more liberal climes, Ann, the Broadway play about Ann Richards' life, is set to have for a final curtain call on June 30. With the possibility of a new standard bearer in the Democratic Party, maybe the old governor can finally get some rest."	Filibustering State Sen.

19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/06/doma_and_the_supreme_court_brian_brown_and_other_traditional_conservatives.html	"The archenemy of the gay marriage movement moved among them, and they didn't seem to notice. Brian Brown, the affable president of the National Organization for Marriage, walked in front of the Supreme Court looking for his next interview. He glanced at one of the celebrants' signs, ""Time for the Sexually Hung-Up Supremes to Come Out of Their Closets,"" and winced a little. He slipped through a crowd of gay men's chorus members in red shirts taking their pictures with Barney Frank. ""Yay, Barney! ""You're a hero!"" Brown kept plowing ahead, looking for the interview stand-up spot. He'd spent the past 41/2 years leading a cause--""traditional marriage""--that the media considers as spent and musty as candle power. The media expected Wednesday to finish off that cause and reported on the death of the Defense of Marriage Act and California's Proposition 8 in historical where-were-you-when terms. But Brown wasn't thinking about defeat. ""They're claiming a little bit of a victory,"" said Brown, referring to the pro-gay marriage litigants. ""I think they're both horrible decisions, but they didn't do what Ted Olson and David Boies wanted them to do, which was a Roe v. Wade for marriage. We're far from that. Now we're going back to the states."" Those states included California. ""If the Ninth Circuit court is vacated, you have a decision that only applied to two couples. There's going to be a petition for rehearing."" At that moment, California Attorney General Kamala Harris was promising that ""the wedding bells will ring"" as soon as the circuit court lifts its stay on gay marriages. Rep. Mark Takano, the first nonwhite openly gay member of Congress, was on MSNBC gushing about gay weddings starting again ""today."" But traditional marriage advocates aren't wrong about the delays to come. Legalizing gay marriage in 37 states will require a combination of voter referenda, successful lawsuits, legislation, and repeal of fresh state constitutional amendments that redefined marriage. It'll take a while. That's not all bad for liberals. A ""Roe for gay marriage"" was the dream scenario, sure, but it would have given conservatives yet more proof that runaway courts were defiling the Will of the People. (You could practically hear them pining for that argument in a sad Wednesday ""press conference,"" where Republican members of the House defended Prop 8 as the wise judgment of voters, then split without answering any follow-up questions.) Wednesday's decisions set up years of gay marriage fights in states such as Oregon and Michigan and New Jersey, where the issue's a stone-cold winner. ""Let's put marriage equality on the ballot,"" tweeted an Arizona Democratic legislator, who figured it would win even in his Republican state. But is the momentum spreading to redder states? The pro-gay marriage flood that started after the November election finally reached the shore this month. Polls, like the past few from CBS News, suggest that pro-gay marriage enthusiasm peaked around 51 percent and has stayed there. And that's nationally, averaging in the support from liberal megastates (New York) that have settled the issue. Ohio Sen. Rob Portman's announcement that he supported gay marriage was supposed to free other conservatives to reveal that they agreed with him. Only two major ones, Alaska's Lisa Murkowski and Illinois' Mark Kirk, have done so. Former Rep. Bob Barr, the DOMA author who famously recanted, is now a congressional candidate again. He responded to the ruling by promising voters that ""I personally believe marriage should be defined as between one man and one woman and, if it were on the ballot in Georgia, I'd vote that way."" And just four weeks ago, Kirk's Illinois, currently run by a Democratic governor and a veto-proof Democratic legislature, belly-flopped on a gay marriage bill when a coalition of black Democrats and ethnic Catholic groups stuck the shiv in. Maybe Wednesday's decisions put some gas back in Democrats' engines. But Washington looks like legislative stalemate. Conservatives can stop Democrats from passing the Respect for Marriage Act, which would repeal the husk of DOMA that the court let live. But the Federal Marriage Amendment they long for would need supermajority votes in both the House and Senate, and they couldn't even get that during the Bush era. ""I've already requested the language,"" said Kansas Republican Rep. Tim Huelskamp. ""We'll hopefully gather co-sponsors, and hopefully this week we'll see if [passing it] is possible. This is a winning issue. All you have to do is look at what happened to California in 2008. John McCain got creamed, and at the same time, the folks that wouldn't vote for a Republican--particularly minority communities--came out to support traditional marriage. It's probably the most attractive feature of the Republican Party, our support for traditional marriage and other issues."" Conservatives can enforce that orthodoxy for now. In 2012, most credible candidates for the GOP nomination competed in Iowa and signed a series of marriage pledges. The pledges of both the National Organization for Marriage and the Iowa Family Leader committed candidates to the Federal Marriage Amendment. Mitt Romney skipped the Family Leader's pledge, and its sponsor went on to endorse Rick Santorum, who won the state and--to the mystification of non-Iowan nonconservatives--returned as a national figure with a voice inside the party. ""This decision today elevates the marriage debate,"" said Bob Vander Plaats, president and CEO of the Family Leader. Conservatives will get to see where the potential leaders of the party stand when they come to Iowa for an Aug. 10 Family Leadership Summit. ""Some will venture into this and say it's a states' rights issue. Some will say we need a marriage amendment,"" Vander Plaats said. He didn't say which stance would become the litmus test, but he offered some powerful hints. ""We view marriage much like abortion, much like slavery. If it's illegal in one state, it should be illegal everywhere, transcending boundaries."" That's the debate conservatives need to prep for. The marriage movement wasn't ended by the court's marriage rulings. ""Today gave us a mixed bag,"" said Vander Plaats, ""but it's a mixed bag we can use.""

21	21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/06/obama_immigration_and_climate_change_obama_s_new_strategies_for_winning.html	"On Tuesday, President Obama tried two presidential adaptation strategies. The first was holding a White House meeting with congressional leaders about immigration reform. The second was an end-run around those same leaders with a speech announcing that the Environmental Protection Agency will regulate greenhouse-gas emissions from existing power plants. Both are methods of dealing with the same obstacle: a Congress the president cannot bend to his will. On immigration, Obama has responded to this reality by stepping back. On climate change, he is stepping forward. Adaptation is a crucial quality for life and business, as Tim Harford explains in his great book Adapt: Why Success Always Starts With Failure. Adaptation allows you to recover from failure, a necessary requirement for risk-taking and creativity, crucial attributes for any leader. Adaptation is also a key requirement of the presidency, because the reality of the president's job is very different than the speculation of a campaign. Congress also repeatedly tests a president's adaptive skill. It changes every two years. And in the current age of partisanship, a president can't expect to deploy LBJ strategies. Those won't work in a Senate where a president's plans must get 60 votes and in the House where conservatives don't even listen to their own leadership, let alone the hated president of the opposite party. Faced with these obstacles and a Constitution that limits executive power, a president must find another way. He must achieve the ""bold, persistent experimentation,"" that FDR championed to find a way around the sclerosis of Washington. Understanding adaptability helps us measure the current president and make smarter choices when picking the next nominees. Unfortunately, presidents aren't judged on adaptability. They are measured often by how they perform set-piece routines--using the bully pulpit or schmoozing Congress or twisting arms--without much assessment of whether those tools are inefficient, antiquated, or broken. This isn't to say that President Obama is good at congressional relations. He's not. But he could be fantastic at congressional relations and still not win the day. Rep. Rob Andrews, a New Jersey Democrat, said in a recent Politico article that the president was weak for not threatening Senate Democrats who voted against gun control, but how useful would that strategy have been? It still wouldn't have gotten Obama the votes he needed to pass the bill. When a president doesn't succeed at the set pieces, he is graded as wanting. Or, when he changes tactics, he's seen as weak. In some circles, President Obama's effort to move climate regulations is seen as a weakness because he cannot get Congress to do what he wants. But what if Congress is immovable on this question (it is!) and the president--in the spirit of experimentation and determination--is trying any other avenue he can find? The relentless search for alternatives to achieve an outcome is usually seen as a key sign of leadership. If you don't succeed, try, try again. In the case of climate change, time is running out, and the president has embraced the least bad option. If he doesn't finalize the regulations for greenhouse-gas emissions before he leaves the White House, a Republican president or a Senate with a new Republican majority could undo them. This doesn't mean this is good policy or the right approach, but it argues for adding adaptation to the evaluation of a president's skills as an executive. President Obama is also considered weak for not using his ability to rally the country to change Congress. He is criticized for his lack of congressional schmoozing and his inability to twist arms. But immigration reform is proceeding toward possible passage because he has consciously chosen not to do those things. He has given very few speeches and not meddled in the congressional process. His administration has tried to be helpful behind the scenes, but Obama has been circumspect. Absenting himself from the debate is helping because Republicans are debating immigration among themselves. It would be easier for a House Republican who opposes comprehensive immigration reform to argue against it if President Obama were on the other side. As Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey said of the vote on the gun-control measure, some of his colleagues voted against it simply because President Obama was for it. ""There were some on my side who did not want to be seen helping the president do something he wanted to get done, just because the president wanted to do it,"" he said. If adaptation is a laudable presidential quality, it is also not sufficient for success. Your adaptation can be weak. Adaptation is nothing without creativity, and on that front, President Obama has been a pretty conventional president. After the Newtown, Conn., massacre, the president tried to transform public outrage into political pressure. When that failed, senior Obama aides said it was because Second Amendment supporters were more passionate than those advocating gun control. That was a predictable truth easily foreseen the day after the shooting. It should have prompted a creative strategy to overcome it. It didn't. That's admittedly not a satisfying critique. If it's insufficient to criticize the president for not applying tools that won't work, it's also unsatisfying to demand that a president adapt and find an exit ramp where one does not appear to exist. But we judge leaders on results, not their cogent explanation of all the problems they face, which is why it is important to adapt to get around those problems. Great leaders create new pathways in impossible situations."	Is Obama Weak for Ducking a Congressional Confrontation Over Climate Change?	['Obama', 'Toomey']	[]
22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/06/senate_immigration_reform_vote_how_a_70_vote_bipartisan_majority_might_not.html	"Later this week, the Senate will pass comprehensive immigration reform, and that's supposed to give the bill momentum in the House. ""We're working to get a very substantial bipartisan majority,"" said Republican Sen. John Hoeven. ""That's going to help in terms of actually getting the bill all the way through the House and into law.""  Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, a member of the Senate Gang of Eight that has crafted the bill, and also a former member of the House, says that, ""Having a significant number of Republicans will change the dynamic in the House."" But what one person calls ""momentum,"" another might call ""recklessness."" If the bill passes the Senate with 70 votes or more, as supporters predict, that could mean the bill is the product of sweet reason and compromise between the parties. Or it could mean the bill won so many votes because it is a bill filled with special provisions meant to buy off particular senators or generally calm the political anxiety of a Republican Party that feels it must improve its electoral chances with Hispanic voters. In a time when voters loathe Congress, will they see this bill as a rare piece of fruit or will they reason that anything that has the support of so many members of a body so thoroughly discredited must be awful? Whoever wins this labeling debate will help determine the fate of comprehensive immigration reform. Momentum Theory is based on the principle that the more votes the bill gets in the Senate, the better the bill is. The rare coming-together of both parties in the Senate might make low-information voters think the bill is in the category of other unassailable good things senators support in large majorities: the American military, national holidays, and Social Security checks. If people don't see Republicans and Democrats collapsing into their usual predictable squabbles--particularly on such a contentious issue--that must mean the path they've agreed on is a wise one. If Momentum Theory is true, polls should show voters increasingly behind the measure. That would pressure those House members whose opposition to reform is not absolute but flavored with some concern about the public will or the national image of the Republican Party. This is why supporters of reform are pushing to run up the Senate vote total to build the bandwagon feeling. On CNN, Schumer took this theory to its stratospheric conclusion, claiming that if the Senate bill is blocked it would result in a protest of ""a million people on the Mall in Washington."" A big Senate victory would also give supporters a way to minimize future debate about the controversial portions of the bill. The House is expected to pass a series of smaller immigration bills but no path to citizenship, which is the heart of the Senate effort. If a House Republican takes issue with a particular element of Senate reform, a supporter will claim the issue was already debated and resolved in the Senate. Charges of bigotry are always just below the surface in the immigration debate. If the perception is that the Senate has already worked through the tough issues, then House skepticism will be easier to frame as being motivated by bigotry instead of policy concerns. The charges won't be coming just from liberals. The Wall Street Journal's conservative editorial page has conveyed that sentiment already about those who oppose reform. Since a number of Republicans worry about how the party is perceived by voters as it debates this issue in public, fear of looking intolerant will be pronounced, putting even more pressure on lawmakers in the House to ratify the Senate version. Those who oppose comprehensive immigration reform have already lost in the Senate. Their best chance to defeat the bill is to make the Senate process the enemy. ""I cannot support an amendment cobbled together at the eleventh hour that doubles the border patrol without knowing how much it will cost or whether it is even the right strategy, said Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas. This opposition seeks to jujitsu the successful Senate vote, turning it into an argument against the legislation. So much of the debate about immigration reform has been about a lack of trust in government and the lawmakers who make laws. Opponents of reform have constantly warned that they are in danger of repeating the mistakes of the 1986 immigration legislation. Amnesty was granted but the promised enforcement against future illegal immigrants never materialized. The surest way to repeat this outcome, they have argued, would be to rush through a bill that no one looked at closely. They've been on particularly careful watch since after the 2012 election, when so many Republicans started promoting the idea that comprehensive reform must pass if the GOP is ever going to win over Hispanic voters and regain its national standing. These opponents are particular skeptical of the Corker-Hoeven amendment that increased border security to keep out illegal immigrants. ""There is some real angst about the Corker border security amendment,"" said one senior Republican Senate aide. ""It's full of add-ons to get votes, was written in secret and in a hurry. That doesn't tend to end well. But it will be cover for enough people to vote for it to raise the number from around 60 to around 70."" The fellow who will have the toughest time choosing between these two competing narratives is House Speaker John Boehner. He must balance the concerns about the national Republican image that motivate so many Republican Senators with concerns from Republican House members who will interpret a big majority vote in the Senate as a warning sign. Boehner's legacy is on the line too. After the defeat of the farm bill last week, Boehner was blamed for not being able to control his caucus. If immigration goes down, he will receive even more blame and much of it from Republicans, who will see the failure of the House leadership as a mortal wound to the party. Immigration reform is a three-act play. We are drawing to the close of the first act in the Senate. Next comes the House. The final act will take place when the two bodies reconcile their alternative versions of reform. The role the Senate immigration bill will play in the next act will be crucial. Whether it will be hero or villain is still being determined."	How an Overwhelming Majority of Senators Hopes to Bully the House Into Passing Immigration Reform	['Corker', 'Schumer', 'Hoeven']	[]

Trent Franks has been sidelined. The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (no easy acronym), which had been a pipe dream in the last Congress, was coming to the floor and expected to pass. The trial of Philadelphia's illegal-late-term abortionist Kermit Gosnell, and the attendant gross-out media attention, powered the bill out of committee. So, typically, the bill's author would lead the debate on his product. Alas. During the bill's last mark-up, Franks had chastised Democrats for trying to ""make rape and incest the subject"" of the abortion debate. ""You know,"" he'd said, ""the incidences of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low."" He'd defied the First Commandment of post-2012 Republican politics: Thou Shalt Not Mention Rape, Especially if Thou Ist a Guy. Franks bowed to reality and allowed Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee conservative with a winsome TV presence, to lead the debate. Outside the House chamber, I ask Franks if he'd really wanted to leave the game with the ball sitting on the 1-yard line. ""Absolutely!"" says Franks. ""We've always wanted as many of the women of this House as possible to speak on the bill. The women of this country, and I think even the women of the House of Representatives, are more pro-life than the men are. The hope is to take away some of these ancillary arguments that have nothing to do with the bill."" But the cornucopia of ""ancillary arguments"" never runs out. Democrats faced the Pain-Capable bill with a strategy honed in 2011 and 2012. The tattered cover of the playbook reads: ""War on Women."" The ability of these Democrats to turn every abortion debate into a Republican embarrassment astounds the GOP. Even a bill like this, which shifts the ""Overton window"" and gets Congress talking about ""fetal pain,"" is weaponized against the GOP. ""They're not debating the issue,"" sighs Louisiana Rep. John Fleming. He's a medical doctor, so he's been placed in the live-on-C-Span speaker rotation in favor of the bill, along with the GOP's women. ""[Democrats] want to dwell on how many men are on the Judiciary committee. They bring up War on Women, or they bring up Sandra Fluke. I mean, it's like they're bringing up all of the buzzwords just because they think that they can get some response from their base."" On the floor, Fleming tells the Democrats what they should be talking about. He describes an ultrasound he saw recently, a fetus ""holding up two fingers as if to say, 'Be patient I'll be out soon.' "" Then he describes an abortion. ""Sticking a trocar into the skull, sucking the brain out. What torture!"" Congressional Democrats dismiss this, because they can. Their party runs the Senate, and their president has already issued a perfunctory veto threat of a bill that will never make it to his desk. Their comrades in the states aren't this lucky. The anti-abortion movement's campaign--using Gosnell as the face of legal abortion--has helped along new restrictions and fetal-pain laws in GOP-controlled legislatures. Their goal is to pass a law that bans abortion before ""viability of the fetus,"" basing it on the new and scientific-sounding standard of fetal pain, and winning a Supreme Court test. They've failed so far, and a 20-week ban in Franks' own Arizona was struck down just this year, but he's ready to lose and lose and lose and then win. ""If you harken back to the partial birth abortion bill,"" he says, ""oh, everybody said--it's not constitutional! It can't pass! It can't go anywhere. It took time to do it, and it even had to survive a presidential veto, but it eventually passed."" Democrats know that too. They've also read the bill, which does more than stop the clock for legal abortion at 20 weeks. The legislation insists that ""by 8 weeks after fertilization, the unborn child reacts to touch."" That's a hole some future conservative is ready to drive a truck through. So Democrats spent Tuesday dog-piling Republicans and asking that essential political question, so well captured in the 2012 election: What about your gaffes? At a morning press conference, a dozen female Democratic House members spent 30 minutes running through the outrages committed by Republicans. Among them: They allowed the bill to be written by ""the all-male [Republican] members of the House Judiciary committee."" Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chair of the Democratic National Committee, insists that ""the Republican men who brought this to the floor do not represent the rights of women in America."" In some ways the press conference is a bust. There are no TV cameras in the room, which is so unusual that staffers and reporters who are walking to their seats duck, as if the cameras are still there. When the speeches end, the very first question comes from a conservative, or at least someone playing devil's advocate and asking Democrats to apply the test they used for this year's gun legislation. ""Democrats said that even if it saves one life, it'll be worth doing,"" asks a reporter. ""Why not support this bill then, if it undoubtedly will save the lives of babies carried through five months of pregnancy?"" Colorado Rep. Diana DeGette, who's running the event, pauses to think about this. ""Well, this is--we already have laws in many states in this country. This bill is blatantly unconstitutional, and if you look at the stated reason of doing this legislation, the Kermit Gosnell case, that gentleman was convicted and sentenced to life. Are there are any other questions?"" The conservative tries to follow up her admittedly leading question. ""No,"" says DeGette. ""Are there are any other questions?"" There is, but it's from another conservative who wants to know if there are any abortion limits the Democrats could consider. ""The Supreme Court has spoken, and this bill is unconstitutional,"" says DeGette. ""One last question."" The last question turns out not to be a question at all but a chance to dig at Franks and his reduced role in the debate. Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx chokes back tears as she reads a prepared statement about how the skeptics ""simply refuse to acknowledge we're dealing with human life in this situation of abortion."" Finally it's time for the debate on the bill itself. Rep. Marsha Blackburn stands at the front of the Republican rows. Nearly all of the House GOP's 19 women line up to speak, and very few men join them. Woman after woman in colorful blazer-skirt combos stands up to chide Democrats for minimizing the ugliness of abortion. Trent Franks sits near the back of the room, saying nothing and not needing to."

24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/06/ralph_reed_s_faith_and_freedom_coalition_conference_republicans_fret_about.html	"The saddest ""gaffe"" is the one that nobody actually bothers to dispute with facts. Such a misstep was delivered in Washington over the weekend, when Jeb Bush faced an audience at Faith and Freedom Coalition's Road to Majority conference. Rushing through a speech, he decided to skimp on euphemisms. ""Immigrants are more fertile,"" said Bush, chuckling at himself as soon the f-word escaped, ""and they love families, and they have more intact families, and they build a younger population. The one way that we can rebuild the demographic pyramid is to fix a broken immigration system."" There wasn't much of a reaction from the crowd, which was still settling into the hotel ballroom, but the word fertility sounded odd to the media. The gaffe was born. ""Where did Jeb Bush take his sex-ed class?"" chortled one CNN host. Watching the coverage you would never have guessed that Bush was right. He could have been more specific--the wombs themselves are not supercharged--but new arrivals to the United States give birth at a rate of 87.8 per 1,000 people. The rate for U.S. citizens is 58.9 per 1,000. The press moved on from Bush, but the three-day conference didn't drop his subject. Fertility was in the air. Jonathan Last, the Weekly Standard writer who just published a book with the subtitle ""America's Coming Demographic Disaster,"" gave a capsule version of his findings to a curious audience. In speeches and panels and hallway chatter, you could hear hard questions about birthrates in America and what sort of births were best for conservatives. The usual answer was any births you got. ""The other side isn't producing that many young people,"" said the radio host Michael Medved, who spoke shortly after Bush. By ""the other side,"" he meant liberals. ""Children are being brought up, disproportionately, by those who are more conservative, those who understand that a baby is not a choice or a burden. A baby is a blessing ... what's going to pay for Social Security if not more children?"" Medved's theory is popular with conservatives--and statistically sound. As Amanda Marcotte wrote for Slate last year, fertility rates correlate quite well with party preferences. Mitt Romney won every state with birthrates higher than 70 per 1,000. Barack Obama won every state where the rates have fallen below 60. (What's keeping people so busy in Vermont?) This stuff is perfect for the Faith and Freedom Coalition and its endless quest to make social conservatives add up to a bigger share of the electorate. Founded by Ralph Reed in 2009, the coalition and its annual conference hang at an unusual place in the right-wing constellation. The group's electoral oomph is difficult to measure. To save time, the press typically takes for granted that this ""Christian Coalition on steroids"" (Reed's term) can pull out evangelical votes. A pre-election profile last year in the New York Times counted off the ""17.1 million registered voters"" in the Reed database and the ""25 million voter guides"" to be distributed in ""117,000 churches."" Then it came time to vote. The white evangelical share of the vote rose from 26 percent in 2008 to--drum roll--26 percent in 2012. If more handbills won't grow that vote, what will? Try more people. And what sort of people? This was the question at a Friday breakout session on outreach to nonwhite voters. ""Last year, for the first time, white deaths exceeded white births,"" said Ron Miller, a black Republican politician turned Liberty University administrator. (As he said this, a young white woman gave up the seat behind mine and fled the room, muttering.) ""The only reason that there was any uptick in the white population of the United States is because of immigration. And [at] the same time, for the first time, half of the under-5 age group is now composed of racial or ethnic minorities. Some demographic trends tell us by 2050 we will be a majority-minority nation. I know there's a lot of smoke and heat over this issue, but there are numbers that can't be refuted."" They can't be read statically, either. Today's immigrant birthrate is not tomorrow's birthrate. It's not going to hold fast until 2050. Six months ago, the Pew Research Center showed that immigrant birthrates were actually falling more rapidly than the birthrates of women born in the United States. Overall, sure, immigrant women gave birth at about twice the rate of other women. But from 2007 to 2010, U.S.-born birthrates fell by 5 percent; immigrant births tumbled by 13 percent. If you take the mathlete's view of politics and you're trying to grow a permanent ideological majority, you'd still take those added numbers. You'd want more human beings to work in America, and you'd want them to flock to your party. Anti-immigration hardliners swear that this can't be done; that's what Mitt Romney found himself saying after his loss, when he told donors that Obama's base had been won over with ""gifts."" If today's lower-income Hispanic voter is inclined to vote for the party that gave him Obamacare, why would tomorrow's low-income Hispanic voter ever vote Republican? It's a hard question, and it didn't get answered in public--at least not at the conference. The going theory for minority outreach was the one offered by Herman Cain, who was for one shining month last year the 2012 GOP presidential front-runner. How did he talk to nonwhite voters, those skeptical people with those enviable birth rates? ""The same way you talk to anybody else!"" It wasn't weak minority outreach that sunk the party in 2012. No, blame ""the number of conservatives that stayed home because they were not enthusiastic."" Liberals don't come off as Pollyannish about demographics. They talk about them with pride--they see a future in which Texas' growing Hispanic population stays on the team and turns the state into another Florida or Ohio, another piece of competitive turf. Jeb Bush sees the same future and asks Republicans to prepare for it. Other conservatives would rather tamp down that conversation or joke about it. ""I think it's kinda dangerous territory, touchy territory, to want to debate over one race's fertility rate over another,"" said Sarah Palin, closing out the conference to a mostly full ballroom. ""I say this as someone who's kinda fertile herself."""	Why Conservatives Want Some of You to Have a Baby or Two	['Romney', 'Obama']	[]
25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/06/racist_tweets_by_gop_kids_have_everything_to_do_with_politics.html	"On Thursday, BuzzFeed Washington, D.C., bureau chief John Stanton published a pair of articles calling out the sons of two separate Republican members of Congress for racist, anti-immigrant, anti-Semitic, sexist, and homophobic social media accounts. Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake's teenage son, Tanner, went by the name ""n1ggerkiller"" in an online game, and posted YouTube comments using the word ""nigger"" and calling Mexicans ""the scum of the Earth."" On his Twitter account, he made prolific use of the word faggot and called his friend a ""Jew"" for stealing a joke. A few hours after the Flake story appeared, Stanton reported that Nevada Rep. Joe Heck's son, Joey Heck, had posted equally stomach-turning comments to his Twitter account. In addition to his repeated use of ""faggot"" and ""nigga,"" he made anti-gay and anti-Mexican remarks, saying NFL quarterback ""[Mark] Sanchez can hop the border faster than he can throw the ball"" and retweeted ""There are gays everywhere. Maybe that's gods way of thinning out the population because faggots can't have babies."" Being a politically minded young lad, he also commented that ABC's Martha Raddatz should not have been a presidential debate moderator because she's a woman and that Mitt Romney made Barack Obama his ""slave"" in a presidential debate. Heck also said that Obama's main accomplishments as president were promoting the sports of ""spear chucking and rock skipping. The sports they do in his home country..."" Several journalists wondered aloud if we should be paying any attention to the rantings of dumb, racist kids who happen to be children of major Republican politicians. After the Flake revelation, Daily Caller political reporter Alex Pappas tweeted, ""Why is this news?"" It wasn't just conservative journalists asking. Nick Baumann of Mother Jones said that although the behavior was unacceptable, he hated the idea of journalists monitoring a kid's tweets. In the Slate office, a few staffers were equally skeptical that these tweets by a couple random punks had larger implications. ""I don't think you can read political bias into this,"" one editor said. While it's true that dumb kids saying racist things on social media isn't a particularly shocking news story, I think there is something about present-day conservative politics worth taking away from these cases. It's something that most of us already knew and something that occasional Slate contributor Tom Scocca articulated wonderfully in an article on this site last fall. Namely, that there is a not insignificant portion of the GOP electorate that exists as a fever swamp of racism, sexism, homophobia, anti-immigrant hatred, and bigotry of all sorts. Obviously not all Republican politicians and voters, or not even a majority of them, are racist, sexist, homophobic, anti-immigrant bigots. But it's a sizable enough constituency that a key part of the Republican message is to use coded--and sometimes not so coded--language to appeal to this crowd. As Scocca wrote right before last November's election: ""For more than four years, without pause, Republicans have been campaigning and propagandizing against an imaginary Obama. At the most grotesque end of the fantasies, he is a foreign-born, anti-colonialist Muslim. In more reputable precincts, he is a power-mad socialist and a dumb affirmative-action baby, promoted all the way to the presidency by a race-crazed, condescending liberal elite."" The dog whistles to this constituency usually involve subtler terms such as ""welfare,"" ""handouts,"" ""illegals,"" ""food stamps,"" and ""Obama phones."" But very often you'll have local, state, and sometimes national officials exposed for explicit racism. It seems like it has become a monthly occurrence that an elected Republican either forwards some horrible racist chain email about President Obama or makes some horrible racist off-the-cuff remark. (For a few examples of this from the past year, see here, here, here, here, here, here, and here.) To read Tanner Flake and Joey Heck's online posts is to see the powerful strain of bigotry that exists within a certain sector of conservative politics. It's true that children of Democrats can be just as wretched as children of Republicans and can do equally idiotic, terrible things. (See the news of Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu's son, Connor, being arrested on charges of drunk driving and hit-and-run driving or any one of Al Gore III's repeated arrests for driving under the influence and reckless driving.) But when bad Democratic kids behave badly, they're way more likely to drive 100 mph while drunk than to say the president chucks spears. Likewise, you rarely ever see Democratic officials getting in trouble for passing on horrible, racist chain emails or making horrible racist remarks. This has everything to do with the political differences between the two parties and their voters. Again, Republicans aren't all racist. But the party actively cultivates racists as voters. Which means that some portion of the Republican electorate, as well as Republican officials, are racists. When a kid literally lives in that political environment, he has a greater chance of being caught up in the extreme end of it. If all of your friends are Republicans and even a small subgroup of Republicans are racist, homophobic bigots, then you're more likely to associate with racist, homophobic bigots and become one yourself than if you're hanging out with liberal, crunchy kids. In the case of Flake and Heck, you may be able to see a family lineage in their tweets. Although he did recently say that a Republican presidential candidate supporting gay marriage is inevitable, Jeff Flake has a long history of anti-LGBT stances. Joe Heck, meanwhile, won the support of self-appointed ""birther queen"" Orly Taitz for his congressional campaign in 2010. While you can't choose who supports you, you can send him or her signals. When Heck's campaign was initially asked whether he recognizes Obama as a legitimate president, the campaign refused to answer, instead telling  the Las Vegas Sun that ""the people of Southern Nevada are far more worried about keeping their jobs and their homes, and putting a stop to reckless spending in Washington."" Heck's spokeswoman eventually clarified to Politico that he had not sought the endorsement and didn't consider himself a birther. But Taitz's public profile is evidence of the type of racial animus within the GOP that I'm talking about, and her support of Heck is evidence that Republicans count these people among their voting base. If you've won the support of birthers, don't be surprised when your son makes comments about Obama being a Kenyan spear-chucker. Likewise, if you're so adamantly opposed to equal rights for gay people, you shouldn't be shocked when your child is exposed as a raging homophobe. Those Twitter feeds did not read like they were written by kids who were rebelling against their parents' Republicanism, but by kids who were embracing an extreme version of those Republican values."

In her 160-character biography written under a thumbnail of her riding on a military transport plane as secretary of state, she referred to her various jobs--from first lady of Arkansas (FLOAR) to senator and secretary of state--and then called herself a ""hair icon,"" ""pantsuit aficionado,"" and ""glass ceiling cracker."" It could have ended there on a note of winning self-deprecation, but it didn't. Referring to her future, it simply said ""TBD ..."" If Hillary Clinton is preparing to be a modern mash-up between Clare Boothe Luce and Eleanor Roosevelt, this is a smart start.* She could adopt the voice of her Twitter biography and crack wise and entertainingly about the issues she cares about. But if redefining the role of elder-stateswoman is not her intent and that ""TBD ..."" was a flirtation with speculation about her presidential hopes, perhaps she should step away from the keyboard. It's too early. Until this moment, Clinton has been able to keep the irritating ""will-she-or-won't-she"" guessing game about her future presidential chances at arm's length. I thank her and America thanks her. It's only been one year since the idiotic veepstakes speculation and the stomach is still sensitive. The implicit hope (a foolish hope, I grant you) was that in exchange for Clinton dismissing the speculation about her future for the parlor game that it is, she wouldn't go ducking behind the ottoman and start playing peek-a-boo. Now she seems to be winking at her future candidacy, which is only going to encourage more speculation and diminish her ability to demur. If this is the start of a Dance of the Seven Veils that precedes a future run, it seems awfully early. Voters could get sick of an extended, coy routine because at its heart, this kind of teasing is dishonest. If you're going to play games, Twitter is the right place for it. The social network has devolved into something between the parlor and the school playground. During the 2008 campaign, it was a venue for unpredictable and electric political information. Like a fledgling low-cost Iowa campaign, there was an unpredictability and genuineness to it. Now it feels as though every day Twitter becomes an ever more perfect distillation of all that is wrong with our political conversation. It's a freak show full of manufactured opinion, fake outrage, gaffe chasing, and all in an arid context-free vacuum. Partisans and insiders splash around in bile while talking past each other. Hillary Clinton will have to join this world if she wants to be a candidate. She, better than anyone, knows that you have to play the game. But she also knows, better than anyone, about how vicious the feeding frenzy can be. Had Twitter been around during the Clinton years the paint might have actually peeled from the White House columns under the vicious heat. Why would Clinton want to join the game sooner than she must? One reason could be to take control of her image. At the moment it isn't just being shaped by speculation about her presidential future. Now is a good time to find a way to remind everyone of the boss-Hillary pictures. The image of world-beater-Hillary is better for her future, whatever it may be, than the combative-Benghazi-hearings-Hillary or the Hillary Clinton whose State Department is accused of covering up reports that members of her security force solicited prostitutes while on official trips and engaged in sexual assault. The political benefit of a Twitter account seems very much up for grabs. Every candidate has a media consultant who convinces them they must be on Twitter, but the uniformity of this advice means almost every account has an embedded flaw: Each is a perpetual inauthenticity machine. Twitter gains its power from connections to the authors. Learning about Patrick Stewart and his pizza habits draws his fans closer, offers the uninitiated an amusing entry into his career, and gives everyone not in those two categories a smile. No politician, or more precisely no politician's staff, dares risk too many of the kinds of admissions and revelations that would create enduring connections. This tension between authenticity that voters find attractive and calculated authenticity meant to dupe voters has bedeviled candidates for several cycles. Twitter accounts pretend to be authentic when in fact they are mostly the same committee-generated pap that we're already neck-deep in. They are like the photo-op at the local beer hall that has become a campaign ritual. An authentic picture of the candidate with a beer would be grainy, shot late at night in a hotel room after six rallies, and feature the candidate struggling to pop the top of a minibar Heineken on the laminate hotel room desk. Put that on Instagram. The challenge for all politicians is highlighted in Clinton's first Tweet. In it, she nods to the creators of Texts from Hillary, the viral Tumblr that imagined the messages Clinton might be sending powerful people around the world. These imaginary texts were printed over the picture that Clinton has now chosen for her Twitter avatar: a picture taken on a military transport flight in which she looks in command of things. The meme was perfect Internet: authentic, spontaneous, funny, and limited. After a run of just a week, the authors Adam Smith and Stacy Lambe stopped the gag. It was in every way the opposite of what a Twitter account created to flirt with a presidential campaign will be. But let's not overdo this exercise in goading Clinton into being more interesting, honest, and accessible than most politicians with something at stake. Who knows what she will do with this new venue. She's only published one little item. Perhaps she might break from the depressing trend and create a voice that is both authentic and politically self-serving. It's all TBD.

We just didn't know until recently that it might be a chance for the two men to exchange best practices. The Chinese government is accused of stealing U.S. military secrets and hacking into the computer networks of American companies. Recent reports suggest the U.S. government may be hacking into the servers of American companies as well. In processing news developments in Obama's second term, the most useful sorting technique for the last few weeks has been to ask: Is this a scandal, a controversy, or merely a flap? The substantive answer in this case is that these revelations about U.S. spy efforts deserve real attention. When officials in the executive branch are given this kind of power, they usually abuse it. That is our history. That's human nature. That is particularly true when there are weak or nonexistent mechanisms to restrain that abuse. The political answer about how important these revelations may be is different. We are simultaneously in the season of high scandal and high fake scandal, but at the moment the political risks seem slim for the president and anyone who supports the National Security Agency's snooping power. For that to change, voters would have to stop giving the executive branch a pass whenever a possible government overreach is done for the sake of fighting terrorism. Polls suggest that people often support measures to catch terrorists that infringe on civil liberties. In a New York Times/CBS poll taken after the Boston Marathon bombing, 78 percent of people said surveillance cameras were a good idea. A CNN poll taken a month later showed the same support for cameras, but that poll indicated that there were limits. People were asked if they would allow ""expanded government monitoring of cell phones and email to intercept communications"" to catch suspected terrorists. Fifty-nine percent said they would not be OK with that. The disclosure this week that the NSA was monitoring huge numbers of phone calls made in the Verizon network is operationally very similar to the disclosure in 2006 that it was doing the same thing. In 2006, people were mostly comfortable with the idea. A  Fox News poll found a small majority, 52 percent, supported the collection of massive amounts of phone data, and 41 percent opposed it. CBS, ABC, and CNN polls at the same time also found majority support, but a Newsweek poll found that 53 percent said that monitoring metadata goes too far. (The fact that the Bush administration, unpopular at the time, had collected the phone information without court approval or without notifying Congress could have influenced these numbers; that's not the case here.) Update, June 11, 2013: Since this piece was published, the first polls have come out evaluating public opinion about the NSA's activities. It turns out the public is even more supportive of snooping than they were in 2006, when the agency's collection of metadata was first discovered. According to a Washington Post-Pew Research poll, 56 percent of Americans consider the NSA accessing telephone records of millions of Americans ""acceptable,"" while 41 percent call the practice ""unacceptable."" What has changed is the partisan makeup of who holds which position. In this poll, 69 percent of Democrats say terrorism investigations, not privacy, should be the government's main concern, an 18-percentage-point jump from early January 2006, when the NSA's activity under the George W. Bush administration was first reported. Compared with that time, Republicans' focus on privacy has increased 22 points. Polling suggests the distinction people draw is between the narrow targeting of suspects versus targeting the broader public. In 2006, when CBS asked people if they would be OK with phone surveillance if the government thought they had a suspect, 69 percent approved. If the surveillance was just a sweep of ordinary Americans? Sixty-eight percent opposed that. Five years later, CBS found roughly the same result. In 2011, 65 percent of those polled said they were willing to let government agencies monitor telephone calls and emails of suspicious people, but when asked about a broader phone snooping ""of ordinary Americans on a regular basis"" 72 percent said they would disapprove of such surveillance. So support for the activities recently disclosed lies in whether people think they're a big fishing expedition or tied to specific work that has stopped terrorism. It's almost certain that we won't know for sure whether these ongoing surveillance efforts paid off in a way that connects them with specific terrorist suspects. Rep. Mike Rogers, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee says they did. (Reuters has reported the attack Rep. Rogers was referring to was aimed at the New York City subway.) Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, also said the surveillance had foiled several terrorist plots. Reports that the monitoring of computer systems has provided the bulk of the information in the president's daily intelligence briefing are likely to make people think that this is useful information worth gathering. Republican leaders who have jumped on each new development in the IRS or Benghazi scandals have been nearly mute in response to these latest disclosures. Republican Sen. Rand Paul spoke out against the program, but his colleague Sen. Marco Rubio defended it. Without a strong political force to keep pushing this story, it's unlikely to stay in the public consciousness in a way that will be politically damaging. If the public is not outraged, it may very well be because they trust these lawmakers when they say these measures are necessary to stop terrorism. That's an aberration from the normal public attitude where more than three-quarters of Americans tell pollsters they don't trust government. It's the exact opposite of what has happened in the IRS investigation. Any Democrat who suggests the extra IRS scrutiny of conservative groups was warranted will find himself sitting alone on the bench. These latest revelations do expose President Obama and Vice President Biden as having highly malleable views. As a candidate, Barack Obama was righteous in denouncing Bush-era policies, saying they jeopardized the rights and ideals of all Americans and that there was not sufficient congressional oversight. He criticized the president for monitoring Americans who did nothing wrong. Biden can be seen here in 2006 pounding on President Bush for collecting phone records indiscriminately. But if Americans believe these programs are part of a long-standing (successful) effort to thwart a major terrorist attack on American soil, it's unclear whether there will be any penalty to pay for the change of heart. The other controversies in Washington appear to have weakened the public's view of the president's honesty. That may be because his answers have been unsatisfying. He learned about the IRS mishap and Justice Department targeting journalists on the news. That may have been proper--he has direct control over neither--but polls show his disconnection has contributed to the view he's not being honest. In the aftermath of the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, administration answers have been fuzzy and evolving. In this case, though, the president supported the NSA activities as soon as the news broke. Since polls show the public trusts him on the issue of fighting terrorism above all other issues, his fast and forceful defense may cause people to give him the benefit of the doubt. In a perverse way it's even possible to imagine that the NSA revelations, by stealing a few news cycles from developments on the IRS investigation and allowing the president to present himself as protector of the American people, may wind up helping the president's standing with the American people. Not even the NSA saw that coming."	Why Americans Don't Fear the NSA	['Paul', 'Rubio', 'Obama']	[]
28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/06/susan_rice_named_national_security_adviser_the_benghazi_investigation_proved.html	"When President Barack Obama named Susan Rice to be his national security adviser, it was not a surprise. White House aides had been foreshadowing it since December when Republican senators made it clear Rice would face an impossible confirmation fight if nominated for secretary of state because of her remarks on the Sunday talk shows about the cause of the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Naming Rice was the president's second affront to Republicans in two days. The day before, he named three nominees to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and challenged Senate GOP leaders to block them. Rice cannot be blocked by the Senate--her post doesn't require confirmation--but it should stir even greater heat. This is the woman Sen. Lindsey Graham said was ""an essential player in the Benghazi debacle."" Given Republican anger about unresolved questions surrounding the attack, this promotion should be the equivalent of George Bush naming Michael Brown the head of the Department of Homeland Security. It shouldn't be. Rice wasn't the key player her critics once thought she was. None of her accusers will admit that, but the congressional investigations into Benghazi have already helped to put her role in perspective--both by forcing the White House to release talking points about those Sunday show appearances and by deciding Rice was such an insignificant player she wasn't worth calling to testify or interview. The focus of current questions about Benghazi is elsewhere. Rice's accusers have changed their initial view in light of new information. It is a strange kind of tribute to her since that's the same defense the White House eventually offered: Rice had given her best understanding of intelligence at the time, but future information changed the picture. In the original case against Rice, Sens. John McCain and Graham argued that she was central to the Obama conspiracy to hide the facts about Benghazi. On the Sunday public affairs shows, Rice had promoted the idea that rioters were spontaneously angered by an anti-Muslim video and that they were not terrorists with links to al-Qaida who may have planned the attack. This message helped to protect the president's re-election chances, which were built in part on his administration's competence fighting terrorism. What we learned from the White House emails related to the Benghazi talking points is that she had nothing to do with the intelligence assessments or crafting the information that she repeated on those programs. The White House wasn't even that involved. It was the CIA and the State Department who shaved the talking points down to the formless mush that represented the first official statements. The idea of a spontaneous demonstration sparking the attack came from the CIA, not Rice. Yes, but what about the video? Rice mentioned that the video sparked the protest. There was nothing about that in the CIA talking points. True, but the CIA-informed talking points say that the Benghazi attack was inspired by the Cairo protests. What started the Cairo protests? The video. The Sunday after the attack is where Rice leaves the story. The video would ultimately be discredited. One of the open questions is why Obama and Hillary Clinton continued to talk about the video after it had been undermined. But that's still a question that has nothing to do with Rice. There are lots of other questions about the attack and information that was put out afterward that still require better answers, but Rice was never the person expected to provide them. Some of the attacks on Rice were also an effort to penalize the administration for its shiftiness. That was real enough, a combination of State Department turf-protecting and dissembling about the creation of the talking points. But Susan Rice wasn't involved in any of that. Still, for some she is a symbol worth attacking for the entire screw-up. This is understandable but irrational. Why penalize Rice when Hillary Clinton is a much more logical target? It was State Department employees who failed. Clinton talked about the video long after intelligence agencies debunked the idea that it sparked the attack. She was the one who testified that there had been no substantive changes to the talking points. If Rice is a symbol of anything, it is the way the administrations of both parties offer officials to speak about events in which they were not directly involved. But if putting someone forward who wasn't involved isn't a good idea, then attacking her for something she wasn't involved in only echoes this mistake. In the end, both Susan Rice and her critics offered incorrect early assessments about complex evolving events. Since she will now be in a position to interact with many of her critics in a position of tremendous power, they will have opportunities to discuss this irony soon enough."

29	29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/06/chris_christie_calls_for_an_october_special_election_the_new_jersey_governor.html	"One of the reasons being governor is good training for the White House is that you are forced to react to unexpected and politically-sensitive events. When a hurricane hits, you must manage the emergency response, comfort the victims, and wring money from the federal government. When a senator from the other party dies, you have to appoint his successor without appearing to look politically craven. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has faced both of these tests in short succession. The former has burnished his credentials at home, while the latter, pressed on him yesterday by the death of the 89-year-old liberal stalwart Sen. Frank Lautenberg, offered a more perilous moment. Christie had been running for re-election minimizing his Republican credentials in the heavily blue state, campaigning as a can-do problem solver, but immediately he had a partisan political problem dropped in his lap. Christie solved the dilemma by going with his party: the Chris Christie party. He announced a special election for Oct. 16, 2013, 14 business days before his own election on Nov. 5. By holding the election early, he avoids increased Democratic turnout on his election day, something that might have occurred if a charismatic Senate candidate like Newark Mayor Cory Booker is the Democratic Senate nominee. Christie could have delayed the election until 2014, when Lautenberg's term would naturally end, but that would enrage Democrats in the blue state who would lose a voice and a vote for 18 months. Christie doesn't want angry Democrats upsetting his re-election chances this November, either. Proving that this was not a cost-free decision, Washington Republicans were angry that Christie didn't do enough for the team by giving them a shot at the Senate seat or at least tipping the balance of the Senate for 18 months. Former House Majority Leader Dick Armey told CNN's Jake Tapper the move was ""debilitating stupidity,"" because the first rule of politics is don't lose the friends you already have for the friends you're never going to get. This decision will help Christie in 2013. Even if Booker wouldn't have cost him the race, bigger Democratic turnout might have shrunk the margin of victory. (The bigger the margin, the better the springboard to the national race.) It is probably good news for Republican candidates down-ballot who will also benefit from avoiding such a spike. But what does it mean for Christie's 2016 chances? That's the question that had political reporters watching the live feed of Christie's press conference announcing his decision on Tuesday. You'd be safe if you said the decision won't matter at all in 2016, because that's almost certainly true of anything that happens three years before the first primary. But this surprise moment does affect the next presidential race in one aspect: It offers a small window into how a President Christie might act in office, something we might have a passing interest in if he actually makes a bid for it. Christie's decision about how to handle the newly open Senate seat was a presidential decision in a key way: There were no good options, the decision was thick with politics and self-interest, and he had to move quickly. So what did we learn about New Jersey's governor? He made a self-interested choice without a great explanation for some of it. (He's acting like a president already!) When pressed for an explanation, he tried to dress it up as a principled stand. He repeatedly refused to back down from a position that wasn't really the salient one: He said he refused to deprive New Jersey voters of an elected voice in Washington. OK, that explains why he decided not to delay the election until 2014--and offers a high-ground rebuttal to Armey--but it didn't explain why he would incur the extra expense ($12 million according to the New Jersey Office of Legislative Services) to hold the election 13 days before his own. He made a series of declarative statements like, ""The costs cannot be measured against the value of having an elected member in the United States Senate,"" which sounds resolute but also falsely implies that the only alternative to the October date was an 18-month delay before an election. It didn't address the question of why you couldn't hold the election on Election Day, November 2013. ""The decision is made and that's the end of it,"" said Christie. The substantive ground upon which Christie made his claim for the October date was that the statute he was following specifically dictates the number of days between when the governor calls the election and when it must be held. It's hard to imagine that if the incentives were aligned differently the damn-the-consequences governor would have felt so bound by the letter of the law. Alas, his hands were tied. But it turns out this solution is not that hard. One way to hold the elections on the same day and save the money would have been for the governor to delay his decision 10 days or so. That would have allowed the election to be consistent with the dictates of the statute and fall on the November Election Day. The governor said that delay would have been ""irresponsible"" because important Senate business on issues like immigration and tax reform would have gone forward--for 10 whole days!--without representation by a New Jersey senator. Perhaps Gov. Christie--always the Washington outsider--isn't familiar with the pace and productivity of the Senate? Given how simple the fix would have been, Christie's blunt talk seems oddly out of place. ""I don't know the price tag and quite frankly I don't care,"" Christie said in a clip that we can be sure his 2016 GOP primary opponents will show us again when they make a broader attack on his conservative credentials. On the substance, Christie's decision on how to handle his state's vacant Senate seat was politically shrewd, and he may emerge looking even more post-partisan if he's lucky enough to have Dick Armey as an enemy. But he didn't perform as well in how he presented it. The danger for New Jersey's no-nonsense governor, suggested by Tuesday's press conference, is that he may have a tendency to use blunt talk as a dodge. Do that too many times and presidential candidate Chris Christie will undermine his brand. Just ask anyone who hitched a ride on John McCain's Straight Talk Express."
