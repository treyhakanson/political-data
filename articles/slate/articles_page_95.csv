You have heard of Lean Six Sigma, right? Perhaps you've listened to Jack Welch drone on about the error-eliminating techniques he implemented at GE. Maybe you've seen the episode of 30 Rock in which Jack Donaghy attends a corporate retreat and is briefed on the principles of ""brutality"" and ""handshakefulness"" in between team-building exercises. That's Six Sigma. ""Lean"" Six Sigma is a slight variation, developed by George and others. When it's implemented, 1 percent of people in an organization go through four weeks of training to become ""black belts"" who do ""nothing but process improvement,"" according to George. Three percent undergo one week of training and become ""green belts,"" helping out their martial arts betters. The entire organization is schooled on slogans like ""variability is the enemy"" (or ""variation is evil,"" as Welch likes to say). The inefficient company becomes efficient. George's purpose is to get the next president to be more like Jack Donaghy. His 501(c)(4), Strong America Now, is omnipresent at Iowa political events, with its red, white, and blue slogan--""No deficit, no new taxes""--splashed on volunteers' T-shirts, hats, and signs. They get in candidates' faces. They tell the candidates that 22,000 Iowans are onboard already. The pitch works. Six of the GOP's presidential candidates, including Iowa frontrunner Michele Bachmann, have signed the pledge. (Tim Pawlenty, who cited Six Sigma in his big economy speech, signed the pledge but is no longer in the race.) They have sworn to attend training sessions and promised to ""eliminate spending deficits and start paying down the national debt by 2017"" by implementing the plan. George had been pushing Lean Six Sigma on legislators long before the 2012 primaries started. He can point to the government organizations that have received the gospel: Fort Wayne, Ind., Erie County, N.Y., the U.S. Army. ""But I couldn't get anywhere with congressmen!"" George says. ""Most of them have no experience working in the private sector. Explaining this stuff to them is like explaining astronomy to a cat."" He's tried, and failed, to get Paul Ryan to read his plan. It sure sounds odd--fixing government with martial arts belts and Jack Welch quotes. Rep. Tom Latham, R-Iowa, introduced legislation that would have made the government implement Lean Six Sigma. It has sat around the Hill with only one co-sponsor. Even Bachmann's Light Bulb Freedom of Choice Act did better than that. But presidential candidates are easier marks. If they're presented with pledges, they're going to think about signing them. If someone hands them an idea, they can say to voters: ""Hey. I have an idea you've never heard before. Who else can say that?"" No candidate has adopted the Lean Six Sigma gospel quite like Newt Gingrich, who has yet to meet a complicated, jargon-stuffed plan that he doesn't like. He name-checked the plan in his feisty Ames debate performance. When he got his turn at the Iowa State Fair's soap box, he announced his idea to make Congress scrap the ""supercommittee"" and become better consultants. ""They ought to come back in Monday,"" said Gingrich, ""and every subcommittee in the House and Senate ought to be assigned the following task. Take every aspect of government your committee is assigned to, bring in experts from business, using Lean Six Sigma, and apply it to rethinking the whole thing. Here's an example. I would take Lean Six Sigma, and I would go through the entire State Department VISA process and redesign it."" But attracting the attention of Newt Gingrich isn't the same as attracting the attention of the public. The Strong America Now campaign hasn't exactly primed voters for a lesson on business strategy techniques. In its TV ad, George says only that he has a plan to ""reduce waste and deficit spending with no new taxes."" Its literature looks like the stuff churned out by every other conservative group, with a sad illustration of a baby dragging a literal ball and chain. The soft sell is a little complicated, too. When George pitches the plan to Tea Party groups, his ambitions for the plan vary wildly. ""Applying this across the board will save $1.5 trillion per year,"" he told one group in 2010, ""and that is a conservative estimate!"" Last week, Gingrich cited a new George estimate: The plan would save $500 billion per year. Not bad, better than what the supercommittee's expected to do, but you hear enough of these different numbers and you wonder what Lean Six Sigma can achieve. So do the program's other promoters. Graham Richard, the Democratic mayor of Fort Wayne, Ind., from 2000 to 2008, is generally credited as the first government official to implement the plan. He gives seminars on how other local governments can copy it, pointing them to the little cost-saving measures his city figured out--$200,000 less a year spent on garbage collection, things like that. ""I support the use of Lean Six Sigma,"" says Richard. ""I'm glad Mike is out there doing this. But I don't like starting the discussion by saying 'Lean Six Sigma will save you money.' This is the start of a process where eventually you'll get to fewer people doing better, yes, of course. At the federal level, I'm just a little bit leery of grandiose promises. We Americans ... we're always looking for the moon shot, the easy solution, just do this and everything will be fine."" This may be the reason that almost every candidate is signing onto the plan, but only Gingrich (who has nothing to lose) is running hard with it. Neither Mitt Romney nor Jon Huntsman, the candidates with the most business experience, has signed the pledge. Huntsman simply won't sign any pledges. Romney's campaign didn't answer a question about why he hasn't signed. ""It's very surprising,"" says George. ""I have made money with Mitt. I met him while working with the Preferred Technical Group. Everybody beats Mitt up for cutting jobs? Well, when I was with Mitt, we doubled employment and we tripled revenue. He ought to be trumpeting that!"" So why wouldn't he sign it yet? The point-and-laugh reaction that Pawlenty got for boosting Six Sigma might have something to do with it. Presidential candidates gain nothing when they get bogged down in details, and this plan cries out for some details. How is this idea, one that part of the government is clearly already aware of, any different than the claim that cutting ""waste, fraud, and abuse"" will balance the budget? There are only two things we know. One: A more efficient government is good, but efficiency alone can't save us. Two: Presidential candidates will say anything."	Lean Six Sigma: Mike George's sitcom-approved idea for making the federal government more efficient.
1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/08/straw_woman.html	"It was a big day in Iowa for people who will not be president. Michele Bachmann crushed at the Ames straw poll, and Ron Paul came in a strong second. If history is any guide, that means neither candidate will make it to the White House. The man who many Republicans think will win the nomination was half a country away. In South Carolina, Texas Gov. Rick Perry announced that he is running for president. The two poles of energy in the Republican race highlighted the tension that faces the party: between sending a message to Washington and sending a candidate who can win an election. All parties face this tension, but it is particularly acute for the Republican Party at the moment. President Barack Obama is weak, which means a Republican candidate could appeal to independents who have soured on Obama. At the same time, Tea Party activists--who give the party its power and energy and who have reshaped politics in Washington--alienate those same independent voters. Michele Bachmann is the perfect message candidate. It doesn't matter to her supporters that she has no executive experience and that she has no notable accomplishments in Washington. These were two of Tim Pawlenty's attack lines in  Thursday's debate, but what becomes clear talking to her supporters is that they want ""someone who can say stop,"" as Thomas Nicholls put it to me. ""She is the one saying stop the loudest."" When you see government as a rampaging elephant, you want a candidate who can shoot the elephant dead, not someone who can manage to ride the elephant better. Bachmann is a very good first-time candidate. At campaign stops, her message is focused, and her connection with the audience is genuine. Her organization was equally honed. The line to get inside her tent stretched nearly to Minnesota. Inside, between country music acts, an organizer asked who had voted, and a sea of fingers pointed toward the ceiling, each marked with a blue dot that signified they had. But the challenge for Bachmann was on display inside her tent. A couple stood at the back of the room with their 9-year-old daughter. When I asked the woman, Tara, why she was supporting Bachmann, she pointed to her adopted daughter. ""If it weren't for her birth mother, I wouldn't be her parent,"" she said, explaining her pro-life connection to the candidate. She shared a deep value connection with the candidate, as did her husband, who summed up Bachmann this way: ""She makes her claim, and she stands her ground."" Still, unasked, they raised the issue of her electability. ""She can be polarizing electorally. She has a Palin-esque quality that can turn people off."" When I asked about Rick Perry, they were open to switching, because he shares Bachmann's values, too. ""If he were here, maybe we'd be at his tent."" Ron Paul's near-victory was as expected as Bachmann's first-place finish. His supporters are passionate. If voting for the straw poll required walking the last mile to the voting booth, they'd have done it on their hands. But while Paul improved over his fifth-place finish from 2007, he is still too controversial to win the nomination. If winning the straw poll means nothing about your eventual chances in the Iowa caucuses or in the general election, why is everyone likely to write off Tim Pawlenty after his third-place finish? Pawlenty needed a result that would help him persuade people he is asking for campaign donations that he can connect with voters when he makes a concerted effort. He got 2,293 votes, half the Bachmann total. It was a weak finish for a candidate who worked the state so hard. When Lamar Alexander came in third in the Iowa straw poll in 1996, it was better than people thought he could do, and it gave him a boost. When he came in fifth in 1999, his campaign was over, because he'd invested so much in the state. Which version of the Alexander history will Pawlenty follow? That will depend on those who might have been willing to write checks to fund his campaign. Without their support, he won't have the resources to compete against the better-funded Perry and the intensely loved Bachmann and Paul. The main candidates competing to win the straw poll had big fancy tents, musical acts, and free barbecue. Ron Paul had a slide for kids called the ""sliding dollar."" (Geddit?) On the edge of this, Rick Perry's supporters watched their man on flat-screen televisions and wore T-shirts with his slogan ""Let's Get America Working Again."" Though he was a write-in candidate at the poll, Perry got 718 votes, besting Mitt Romney, who got 567, even though he, unlike Perry, was on the ballot, a sign that Perry's late-starting organization effort paid off. Those vote totals are small compared to the votes Paul and Bachmann got, but no sign can be too small for insiders trying to figure out how Rick Perry changes the alignment in the Republican race. Perry is considered a strong candidate because he can raise money, and because he combines Tea Party appeal with prospects among the GOP establishment. A veteran of New Hampshire politics says that the party officials and insiders who are anxious to jump to Perry are not Tea Party types but Republicans who backed George W. Bush and his father. Perry is ""the complete picture,"" to repeat the cliche I've heard from insiders too many times. But is he really? This takes us back to the tension within the Republican Party. Perry may be a great primary candidate, but will he be a good general election candidate? That is the key issue Romney will raise for the next several months. Romney will argue that Perry is too Tea Party to win in a general election. Also, is the country ready for another Texas governor? Perry may be very different from George Bush. Their camps dislike each other, but when he talks, the echoes of our most unpopular recent president abound. But before Perry can get to the general election, he will face a series of challenges. The first is that he is a vessel for voter expectations. He's everything to everyone. That can lead to disappointment if the reality doesn't live up to the dream. When I asked the New Hampshire veteran what quality of Perry's had people rushing to him, he said, ""That's the funny thing, they don't know much about him."" In September, there will be three GOP debates--three chances for Perry to look less than advertised. Reporters will start looking at his Texas record and his dealings in the back-room world of Texas politics. He'll have to respond to these stories on the national level for the first time with less time to recover than if he'd started his campaign earlier. And he'll have to learn how to adjust his considerable talents as a Texas politician to the small rooms of Iowa and New Hampshire, which require a different touch. He'll start in Iowa Sunday with a stop at the Iowa state fair, where his opponents spent the week being wowed by this year's culinary delight: fried butter. Old hat for Perry. They served that at the Texas state fair two years ago. Become a fan of  John Dickerson on Facebook."	Iowa straw poll: Michele Bachmann wins, and the GOP presidential campaign kicks into a new phase.
2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/08/snipefest.html	"It was hard to peg the precise amplitude of Mitt Romney's smile at the third GOP presidential debate. While his opponents bickered with each other, he stood amused. Was it the grin the father of the bride keeps when the groom's mother gives a toast that goes on too long? Or was it the gentle fazed-out look of a parent at a kindergarten play? The debate had the makings of a serious discussion about leadership, what form it should take, whether the candidates have demonstrated it, and how it should be applied in Washington. However, this discussion took place in a roller derby where that underlying theme was obscured by people trying to bruise and batter each other. Criticisms and veiled critiques broke out into the open among candidates desperate to avoid being eliminated from consideration. In the end, there was a lot of arm flailing. Everyone went round and round, and the lot of them wound up where they had stood before the debate began. When nothing changes, that helps the front-runner, Romney. But Romney did more than coast and avoid getting drawn into any of the fights. When he spoke, he stayed focused on the economy and his experience in business as the only one who ""actually worked in the real economy."" People care about jobs, not the minutiae the other candidates were debating. Usually on a fight card, the main event is held last, but Rep. Michele Bachmann and Gov. Tim Pawlenty reversed that order. The Minnesota Melee was biggest and came first. Pawlenty argued that Bachmann boasts about leading fights in Washington but never wins those fights. ""Leading and failing is not the objective,"" he said. ""If that's your view of effective results, please stop. ... You're killing us."" Bachmann responded that what voters want is a leader who doesn't bend and that her success should be measured by the strength of her stance, not by how much progress she makes. ""I have a very consistent record of fighting very hard against Barack Obama and his unconstitutional measures in Congress,"" Bachmann said. ""That is what qualifies me, as a fighter and representative of the people, to go to Washington, D.C., and to the White House. People are looking for a champion. They want someone who has been fighting."" To make her case for the perils of not standing firm, she used Pawlenty's record against him, noting his support for cap and trade, a cigarette tax, and support for an individual health care mandate. She argued that his record ""sounds a lot more like Barack Obama if you ask me."" Children, children, Romney seemed to be saying with his smile as he looked on. Bachmann boasted that she opposed lifting the debt ceiling at all and suggested the S&P downgrade was a vindication of her position. (Earlier in the day, S&P had actually said the opposite.) Sen. Rick Santorum chastised Bachmann, arguing that her brand of leadership was merely ""showmanship"" and wouldn't work in the real world. Bachmann and Pawlenty went several rounds. The Fox moderators were tough and good throughout, but this was the moment when the thread was nearly lost completely. In a country where so many people think their elected leaders are out of touch with the grim state of their lives, the back and forth must have sounded like a debate over dessert toppings. The two Minnesotans went after each other so hard because they have the most at stake in the straw-poll vote taking place among Republican activists on Saturday. Pawlenty's campaign is struggling. He needs to do well in the straw poll to keep donors writing checks. Iowa is a winnowing state. It doesn't pick presidents, but the caucuses narrow the field. A bad straw-poll showing can end a candidacy, too. If Pawlenty doesn't do well enough on Saturday, his campaign may die the way Lamar Alexander's did in 2000. Bachmann has a strong following and organization, and she is likely to do well in Saturday's vote. She couldn't afford to lose her momentum, and she didn't. She parried Pawlenty's attacks forcefully. The second debate of the night was between Newt Gingrich and Fox News. The former House speaker was asked about the mass defection of his aides and about his overspending, and he shot back that it was a gotcha question. ""I'd love to see the rest of tonight's debate asking us about what we would do to lead an America whose president has failed to lead, instead of playing Mickey Mouse games,"" he said. Great answer. Great theater. Very silly. Gingrich is a man of a thousand ideas, but leadership is about ideas and implementation. Gingrich has shown a lack of discipline in his professional and private life. A question about an undisciplined campaign goes directly to his abilities as a leader. Gingrich made this point later when talking about Ronald Reagan, who, he pointed out, was able to pass tax cuts with a Democratic Congress by rallying the country. That kind of thing requires operational discipline that Gingrich hasn't shown. The third fight was between Rick Santorum and Ron Paul over Iran. Paul, who broadly disapproves of U.S. meddling in the affairs of other nations, said the United States should not fret about Iran gaining nuclear weapons. Santorum jumped on Paul, saying anyone who held Paul's view ""is obviously not seeing the world very clearly."" Paul accused Santorum of a march to war identical to the one that led to the conflict in Iraq. Paul was once again the crowd favorite. He will do well in the straw poll. When he talks about individual liberty and spending restraint, it sounds far more authentic than when the other candidates sound similar themes. It was Gov. Jon Huntsman's first debate. He offered his own version of leadership. He was the only candidate who praised the House Republican debt-limit deal. He stood by his support of civil unions. He embraced the moderate view of leadership focused on working together and getting solutions. He seemed out of place in a party that doesn't define leadership that way. If Michele Bachmann is red meat, he is soybean. Still, in a debate about leadership and whether it is demonstrated through compromise or by steadfast adherence, the view was clearly tilted toward the latter. When the candidates were asked if, in order to get a agreement on cutting spending, they would accept a deal that included a 10-to-1 ratio of spending cuts to tax increases, not one candidate said they would. This was the last debate before Texas Gov. Rick Perry enters the race. He has a populist appeal, a record in his three terms as governor that will sound good to GOP activists, and a network of fundraisers ready to launch his campaign. He is slated to announce Saturday, which means Mitt Romney may only have a few more days to enjoy that smile. Become a fan of  John Dickerson on Facebook."	Republicans 2012: Mitt Romney survives the third GOP debate.
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/08/hey_remember_me.html	"HUMBOLDT, Iowa--It became very clear, very quickly, what the media was looking for from Tim Pawlenty this week. We wanted him to tell us what Tim Pawlenty thought of the other people running for president. The governor started Tuesday with an 8 a.m. trip to a cafe outside Des Moines, then returned to the Capitol where he joined social conservative groups--the National Organization for Marriage, the Iowa FAMiLY Leader--at the launch of their Values Voter bus tour. ""I want to thank you for standing for a culture of life,"" he said. ""I want to thank you for standing for traditional marriage. I want to thank you for standing for those values that made this nation great."" As he spoke, a platoon of handsome young people wearing orange T-shirts passed out fliers for Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas, who is likely to announce his own presidential bid on Saturday. A lone conservative protester, John Strong, held up a sign attacking Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., for being too kooky. Pawlenty wrapped and walked over to talk to a few voters. A reporter used the lull to ask a question. ""What do you think of Gov. Perry getting into the race on Saturday?"" Pawlenty conferred with his spokesman, Alex Conant. ""We're not doing a scrum,"" said Pawlenty. He walked into the campaign's temporary conveyance, a Winnebago Voyager unadorned by any campaign colors or logos or portraits. (There is a decked-out bus for the ""Road to Results,"" but it's in the shop with busted air conditioning.) Back outside, after only four minutes of exposure, the few voters watching all this had shrugged. ""He doesn't have a lot of zap or enthusiasm,"" Strong fretted. ""He reminded me of Bob Dole."" Strong will head to the Ames Straw Poll in search of someone better. The next event was all Pawlenty's--no ""grass-roots"" Perrymaniacs, no protesters. A library in Boone, Iowa, up I-35 from Des Moines, handed the campaign its meeting room, and it filled up quickly. Around 50 people, mostly older men, made their way past a table covered in TPaw literature (a picture of the governor in hunting gear; a smiling family photo with the ""results not rhetoric"" slogan) and vied for a small number of chairs. It was an ideal Pawlenty crowd, completely unconcerned with the flashier candidates, completely interested in beating Barack Obama. ""I'm not looking for pizzazz,"" said Len Schabold, a business consultant from the city. ""I voted for McCain last time,"" said Steve Lawler, a farmer who lives eight miles east of the library. ""McCain could have won, maybe, if he'd had the right running mate. I think that could have been Pawlenty, to tell you the truth."" Pawlenty arrived and gave them what they expected. His stump speech consists of three or four moveable parts. Depending on how they're arranged, they can lead to something that loses steam quickly, loses steam slowly, or slowly builds into a raise-the-roof success. They all start well, with Pawlenty trying to convince the crowd that he's a schlub. The Boone version of the trope is a story about his wife giving him a pep talk about running for governor in 2001--""I'm Rocky Balboa, and this is my Adrian!""--that he remembered when he came into office. ""The job was very hard to deal with from a schedule standpoint, and Mary was holding me to account for my schedule,"" said Pawlenty. ""We had a little tense discussion about that. I said, 'Honey, don't you remember? You're the one that gave me the inspiring speech in my living room to do this.' And she said, 'Yeah, I remember, but I didn't think you'd win!' "" The underdog act works for Pawlenty. Beyond that ugly, temporary bus, there are other homey aspects to his campaign that contrast mightily to Michele Bachmann's or even Herman Cain's. Bachmann barrels into her events, led by security staff, with a sound system blasting ""Promised Land."" Pawlenty hugs the wall of a room before being invited up to speak, and he shoots the breeze with voters as long as he's running late. All that amplifies his pitch: Choose the safe, vanilla candidate. Don't choose me now, and you'll come around to me once you're fed up with this month's celebrity. ""Any bobblehead can come up here and recite the Republican platform,"" he said in Boone. Pawlenty's implication is that he is the lone nonbobblehead in the field. When he got to the proof for that suggestion, discussing his record in Minnesota--""we cut spending growth to 1 percent a year; we cut spending in real terms for the first time ever""--the crowd was a little less engaged than it was when he was making fun of himself. It perked up again when he returned to President Barack Obama. ""You can stick a fork in him,"" Pawlenty said. ""He's done, politically. The polling nationwide is bad, and if you look at the polling in the swing states, it's even worse. The only way we can mess this up is by choosing the wrong Republican."" But that's the problem. When an incumbent looks weak, the other party's voters can dream big. Barack Obama probably couldn't have won the presidency had voters not soured so completely on Republicans by the end of 2008. If you remember back to 2005 and 2006, the smart Democratic take was that someone bland with ""red state"" appeal, an Evan Bayh or Mark Warner, was the most electable Democrat. Bush collapsed, so an African-American guy with a pastor who thought some interesting things about the CIA became electable. If Obama's so weak, why not roll the dice on a Bachmann or a Perry? Pawlenty wrapped in Boone, headed outside, and gave an interview to a Seattle TV station all about his lack of momentum (he's in third place, according to poll averages) and the coming Perry effect. ""I respect Rick Perry,"" Pawlenty said. ""I like him. He's done a good job for his state."" At his next stop, at the Chantland plant in Humboldt, Pawlenty gave a speech to employees, donned safety glasses for a factory tour, and answered more questions about Perry. ""I know Rick Perry. I respect him, I like him. We traveled together. He did a good job for his state."" With voters, one-on-one, he can chat about anything. His political speeches, even his statements to the press, are all assembled from that box of refrigerator magnets. Stay bland, let everyone else burn out. Pawlenty closed the day with two stops at Republican county picnics. The first was a little tough to find, and I turned around in a man's driveway as he returned from running errands on a little scooter. ""You're looking for where Bachmann is?"" he asked. Technically, yes. Bachmann spoke at the Humboldt County GOP picnic before Pawlenty did; later, he would have to follow Herman Cain in Wagner County. Her speech was outside the picnic hall, audible blocks away; in it, she informed voters that she had spent ""two weeks"" building opposition to the first vote on the Troubled Asset Relief Program. As it wrapped, and she shook hands to the booming sounds of ""A Little Less Conversation"" and ""I Got You (I Feel Good),"" Pawlenty staff prepped for his speech inside the hall, near the for-sale pies and dishes of pulled pork. It was his strongest speech of the day. He didn't spend much time talking up his record in Minnesota. He ripped into Barack Obama instead. He spent more time than he had in Boone on a gimmicky, Tea Party-flavored idea: making members of Congress fill out their own taxes without help, ""under penalty of perjury,"" to remind them how badly the code needed to be slaughtered. As Bachmann's mammoth bus pulled out, he was waging a war on slickness. ""Let's remember how this happened!"" he said. ""A very fancy-talking candidate came through Iowa, and he made a lot of promises!"" Pawlenty got a standing ovation. The Republicans sitting near me were frank: They expected him to be worse. ""He's much better than I expected from TV and his literature,"" said Dean Harman, a local veterinarian. ""He's not near as dynamic as her, though! Boy, she can give a speech."""	Tim Pawlenty in Iowa: Staying bland and playing it safe.
4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/08/and_god_will_send_rick_perry.html	"HOUSTON--""Pray for our economy!"" says Doug Stringer of Turning Point Ministries. ""Pray for our country! Pray for our businesses, for jobs!"" His sermon reverberates from the stage into the seats and bleachers of Reliant Stadium. Thousands of Christians--many of the 30,000 who've made it inside--get up and take his advice. They break into small huddles and start praying about the economy. Walking past them, I hear incredibly specific words like ""investments"" and ""9.2 percent unemployment"" and ""downgrade."" I see people tearing up, dabbing their eyes, praying even more. They have to finish quickly, before the next round of songs and prayers. They've already sat through three hours of them; there are four hours left to go. ""The Response"" is overwhelming, and that's the point. Just two months ago, Gov. Rick Perry, R-Texas, became the initiator of an event where Christians would ""call upon Jesus to guide us through unprecedented struggles."" Perry was coming off a Day of Prayer to call for rain amid a crippling statewide drought. (It has not been completely successful.) Why not turn the dial up to 11? The American Family Association would foot much of the bill; a governor with simmering presidential buzz would do the promotion. It came together better than they could have hoped. The cars driving into the Reliant's many parking lots  clogged Kirby Drive for miles and backed up some of I-610. They had left their homes after hearing that Standard & Poor's had downgraded the United States' credit rating from AAA to AA+. More bad news, as if they needed it. ""I'm going to take a hit,"" says Julius Maresh, a 68-year-old engineer from Houston who had expected to retire by now. Instead, he spent the last three weeks watching his 401(k) lose $50,000. He illustrates his expectations for next week by pointing his thumb down and making the noise a crashing plane makes: ""Kerrrrrsshhhh."" They're scared when they arrive. Inside the stadium, cooled 30 degrees below the triple-digit temperatures of Houston in August, they are offered solace and bliss. This is a Christian event, but it's nondenominational, and it has a governor's stamp of approval. Attendee after attendee assures me this is historic. They share stories of the smaller churches that have prayed to make this happen. Starr Finn, a Born-Again missionary who sports a pin shaped like two babies' feet--""it's against abortion,"" she says--describes The Response as an answer to ""The Call,"" a long-running series of nondenominational mega-rallies. This is a lot like The Call. The promotional material for the next Call rally, in Detroit in November, explains that the city ""has become a microcosm of our national crisis--economic collapse, racial tension, the rising tide of the Islamic movement, and the shedding of innocent blood of our children in the streets and of our unborn."" But The Response is a little sunnier, says Finn. It's a complement to the 24-hour, 7-days-a-week prayers going on at some of the churches that organized this event. ""They have been praying and fasting for our nation for a decade,"" she tells me, standing right in front of the stage where Radiant Band is singing about how there's ""no God like Jehovah."" ""This is the first time a governor, one of the highest-ranking officials in the government, made a stand and said: We need this,"" says Finn. ""It says in 1 Peter that we should submit to governors. As true believers, as Christians, when the governor wants us to be here, we're really required to be here."" I want to double-check that. I do so with the Bible of a man who kept it in a sleeve bearing the legend: ""This Book Is Illegal in 57 Countries."" The verse in question says, ""Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme."" So it thrilled Finn, and it thrilled lots of other people here, that Perry was reintroducing himself as a leader they wouldn't mind submitting to. ""God will send a leader when we need one,"" says Finn. Pete Ortega, one of dozens of people who's come up from San Antonio on buses from John Hagee's church, doesn't go this far. There is nothing political about the event, he says. He just wants to praise Perry. ""If this is successful here,"" he says, ""I think other governors, or other politicians, will come out of the closet. Christianity is under attack, and we don't speak out about it."" That's the brilliance of what Perry has done here: These ideas don't contradict each other at all. He doesn't need to talk about politics, or do anything besides be here and understand this event. The religion is the politics. These worshippers understand that if they can bring ""the kingdom of God"" to Earth, economic problems, even macroeconomic problems, will sort themselves out. ""If I have a supply, and you have a need, I will be able to help you out,"" says Jim Hylton, the pastor of a new church in Fort Worth. ""That's a far better system than one where the government takes what I have in taxes and gives it to you after a lot of middle men have figured out how to. Now, S&P has downgraded our credit rating. That says to me that our system doesn't work. Well, if our system doesn't work, is there another system we can use? One that works?"" He pauses to make sure I know the question is rhetorical. ""There is."" When Perry hits the stage, it's a perfect union of speaker and audience. He is not announced by name. The giant screens broadcasting these images to the stadium don't even refer to him as ""governor."" The only perk he's allowed is that he doesn't have a Spanish-language interpreter sharing the loudspeakers with him, a quirk that has made some of the other speakers hard to understand. He reads from the Book of Joel, 2:12-17:"	Rick Perry leads prayers for jobs, becomes the great Republican hope.

She waves her bangle-adorned hands. She grins whenever she pauses to take a breath. Every question gets a minutes-long, ranging disquisition. This morning, sitting in a cream suit in her airy cream office in the Capitol, Pelosi spoke with a group of reporters for more than an hour about the current crummy economic situation and crummier Congress. She smiled. But that hardly hid her voluble frustration. Her points were these: She is deeply dissatisfied with the debt deal and the deficit-reducing supercommittee it creates. She believes Republicans are essentially political nihilists, and she has plans to prevent them from winning again. And she is intensely focused on jobs and growth. ""Everybody who has looked at this issue said, 'Do not make big cuts too soon, you will slow economic growth,' "" she said, referring to the debt deal. ""I also think passing something, to get it over with, to move on, was necessary. And compared to default, it is preferable."" She smiled. ""That is my way of saying: I don't think this was the best path we could have taken."" A reporter brought up whether, with House Speaker John Boehner having trouble with his fractured caucus, Democrats might have wrangled a better deal. ""A week ago, [Boehner] went to the dark side,"" she said, her hand fading away from her dramatically. She also waved off discussion about the construction of the new supercommittee, tasked with finding another $1.5 trillion in savings. ""It is a victory for [Republicans] if we spend a lot of time focusing on the who, what, when, where of this commission,"" she said. But she admitted exasperation with it, noting that she had heard it described as a ""characterization of food, but not at the beginning of the digestive process."" When talking about how to defeat Republicans in 2012, Pelosi depicted them as chaotic and destructive.  ""Why don't they want to create jobs? Is it because they want the president to fail? I'm not going to go into that,"" she said. Dismantling the ""public sphere"" is their endgame, and they will ""use the engine of deficit reduction as an excuse to destroy"" it, she warned. ""We cannot let them do that."" How might Democrats stop them from demanding more cuts in the next go-round, possibly in September when Congress needs to re-up the government's funding? Maybe, just maybe, she seemed to imply, by allowing a shutdown. ""Suffice it to say that you won't see a repetition of what happened last week,"" she said, ""taking us to the last minute when they didn't even have the votes, and then saying, 'You'll be responsible for default.' "" She noted, ""A default is a much more serious consequence than a shutdown of government for a few days."" And she added, ""Expect us to be more visible in terms of what we say here and how we mobilize outside, so Republicans know the risk of taking us to the brink."" The third big topic: jobs and growth. This morning's discussion came at a queasy moment. Congress has averted immediate economic disaster by lifting the debt ceiling. But investors are fleeing stocks for the safety of bonds. Inflation expectations are withering. Virtually every indicator--industrial production, employment, consumer spending, business confidence--is flashing red. The markets are betting on another recession. If it hits, Washington will have no fiscal tools and few monetary tools to help jolt the country out of it. She admitted the difficulty of trying to pass jobs legislation when Congress has refused any more spending and when Republicans prioritize preserving the richest Americans' wealth. In a moment of introspection, she wondered out loud about how many homes, pieces of ""museum-quality art,"" or big yachts a person could possibly need. ""I have concluded that some of these people want something that is intangible,"" she said. ""Immortality!"" But she said she had plans in the works, citing at least four places for bipartisan compromise: infrastructure investment, nudging China on its currency manipulation, ""incentivizing"" the private sector, and clean energy. She described herself as ready for that fight, for jobs and growth. Congress, she said, is always contentious. ""They used to cane each other and have duels! The Speaker of the House Henry Clay was in at least one duel!"""	Nancy Pelosi on the nihilist GOP: Her plan to fight back against the Republicans.
6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/08/the_democratic_unemployment_act.html	"On Sunday, after he'd been schooled by leaders on the automatic cuts that could make a debt deal possible, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad, D-N.D., talked to reporters. He was tight-lipped on the details but broadly optimistic about the bargain. There was one nagging question I wanted to ask: All the discretionary spending cuts in the plan--did they threaten to slow down growth, to drive up unemployment? ""Sure they do,"" he answered. ""Now, what we don't know is: What will the offset be of improved certainty and confidence? And we'll just have to see."" I asked some version of that question to a number of key Democratic senators. They didn't enjoy answering it. The deal that many of them have already reluctantly agreed to support is worse than they would have allowed themselves to imagine just a couple of months ago. Republicans got most of what they wanted. Democrats got ... an increase in the debt ceiling, an ugly but rote admission of blown-out spending, the sort of thing that Congress usually passes without incident. ""Nothing's 'usual' about this,"" Conrad said. The Democrats lost this debate, but that's not a surprise. The perception that the stimulus bill failed has given Republicans a slashing comeback for every spending plan: You guys tried it, it didn't work, let us try the opposite. Backed into a corner, Democratic senators and a Democratic president have agreed to discretionary spending cuts that they think will slow down economic growth. It's not just Democrats who think this. As the latest, least-doomed version of the deal was hammered out, the New York Times' Binyamin Applebaum and Catherine Rampell were interviewing economists about the effects of looming cuts. ""When you do fiscal adjustment in the near term,"" said IMF economist Paulo Mauro, ""it does have an adverse impact on economic growth."" An analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the Vatican of debt angst-mongering, sighed at the silliness of forcing cuts through now, in a weak economy, when they would have been better timed during a boom. Why? Because spending cuts drive down growth in the short-term with the promise of growth in the long term. Republicans dispute this. When they took charge in the House, they labeled their agenda ""cut and grow."" The buzz phrase lacked one thing: evidence. Stimulus money has dried up. New Republican governors have lived the gospel of budget cuts. Coincidentally enough, GDP growth is way down from expectations for the year so far. Job creation is weak; back in March, Moody's Analytics and Goldman Sachs predicted that spending cuts could have that effect. The Commerce Department points to the spending cuts as the culprit. Democrats agree, but they have to sign on to this plan anyway. This leaves them sounding like Pythagoreans thinking deep about the movement of the planets when they explain how the spending cuts/explosive job-growth formula works. ""If you get economic growth for some period of time, you'll see job creation,"" said Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb. ""Probably the best kind of jobs bill you can have is one that gives you long-term certainty."" Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., a freshman who's not up for re-election until 2014, spoke in darker tones about the effects of cuts. ""Obviously, anything that reduces support for states and local governments or business will have some impact,"" she said. But she echoed other Democrats. The cuts are the cuts. Accentuate the positive: The impact of avoiding downgrade or default (there's still some hemming and hawing from the rating agencies to get through, but this looks to be true) and getting a debt limit hike that'll last through 2012. Does that mitigate the damage that they think this will do to the economy? A debt limit hike was what Democrats--and everyone else--expected at the start of the process. Getting it doesn't stop Republicans from invoking the ""Confidence Fairy,"" because they argue that regulations and tax policy are the real causes of employer and investor befuddlement. It doesn't prevent a new kind of uncertainty. What will the ""supercommittee"" propose? Who loses out if the committee's recommendations aren't picked up, and an automatic ""trigger"" package of deep cuts goes into effect instead? ""There's certainty in different elements of the plan,"" said Conrad. ""The critical certainty to accomplish here is that the United States is not going to default, and we're not going to be going through this circus in six months. That outweighs, in most people's minds, worries about the uncertainty of how the savings in the second round will be achieved."" Fair enough. The debt limit will be raised. If you buy the polls, Republicans have taken a little bit of damage over the impression that they were willing to tie the nation's credit rating to the railroad tracks as the train zoomed into view. You can argue, as Conn Carroll does, that ""Obama has set himself up for some huge policy victories as long as he wins reelection."" But does the deal make it easier for him to win re-election? When Bill Clinton was triangulating, he had 5.4 percent unemployment to run on. Barack Obama won't have that. He and his party, having given up on John Maynard Keynes, can benefit from this deal only if they were wrong about economics all along. Otherwise, what could Democrats say they got from the deal? ""They get significant deficit reduction, which is going to help stabilize the markets,"" offered Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the finance committee. What about the bigger picture? Leaving aside Obama's prospects, is this the new normal? Are debt-limit hikes always going to be accompanied by spending cuts? ""Look,"" said Baucus, ""whatever works. We've never had deficits this large before, and we've got to get them reduced."""	Debt-ceiling debate: How will Obama and Democrats justify the spending cuts in the deal?
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/07/knocked_off_balance.html	"Update, July 29, 12:10 p.m.: It may just be a PR victory, but the conservatives appear to have won. The new version of the Boehner plan makes the balanced budget amendment even more important. Under the latest version, a second vote on raising the debt ceiling will be conditioned on the passage--in both houses--of the amendment. (The earlier bill required only that the amendment be voted on.) Rep. Mike Pence emerged Thursday from the GOP's morning conference a changed man. Once, he had led the Republican Study Committee that was now causing so much grief and bellows and threats because of its role in the debt fight. Once, he was a potential presidential candidate that the Tea Party actually liked. Now he was changing his vote. He would support, maybe, the Boehner plan, because Boehner was going to give him something in return. And what was that something, exactly? ""Since the 'clean' balanced budget amendment was added to the schedule tomorrow, I announced my support of the Boehner plan,"" said Pence, his jacket slung over his shoulder. Hang on: What's a ""clean"" balanced budget amendment? ""It's the historic balanced budget amendment that passed both houses of Congress 15 years ago,"" Pence explained. That was the version of the amendment that had no caps on how much Congress was allowed to spend, no new rule that required two-thirds of Congress to approve new tax cuts. ""That's the one that has an opportunity to get 290 votes, to pass by the sufficient two-thirds majority. We can make a good faith effort to pass the version that has a fighting chance."" It sounds great, although as of this writing it's unclear whether it was enough to save the Boehner plan. (Here's the latest on that story.) When Republicans rewrote the balanced budget amendment for their ""Cut, Cap, and Balance"" bill, they made it totally unpalatable to Democrats. Even Rep. Paul Ryan would eventually admit that. ""I just never thought that was realistic,"" he said Wednesday, ""to demand Democrats vote against their consciences."" The ""clean"" balanced budget amendment, though--that was another story. (Among GOP aides, the amendment is alternately called ""clean"" or ""classic."") It could get every Republican vote. It would need 49 Democratic votes to hit that two-thirds ceiling. In 1995, 72 Democrats voted for the classic amendment. There's even a ""clean"" balanced budget amendment introduced by a Blue Dog Democrat and co-sponsored by 24 of his peers. This is doable. Just kidding! It turns out that pushing through a vote to amend the Constitution in 24 hours, as a sweetener to pass a bill that Democrats hate, may not be the best way to make this happen. Some of the Democrats I talked to on Thursday--I focused on the ones from somewhat conservative districts--were elusive, surprised to hear that this was the GOP's new, new plan, and unready to take a stance. The more liberal Democrats were just blowing it off. ""It may be a way for some of the right wing to get some comfort because they have to vote for reality,"" shrugged Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass. One of the obvious problems, if you dig into the old BBA votes, is that the Democrats who used to back it are either retired, defeated, or lobbying for a living. The list of names on the old BBA roll calls are pocket histories of how the South moved from Dixiecrat to bright-red Republican. Republican-turned-Democrat Nathan Deal! Barely-remembered former Sen. Blanche Lincoln! The one name that stands out is Steny Hoyer, now the party's whip. Republicans love to needle him for his old vote, but he's already recanted it. ""As someone who supported the 1995 balanced budget amendment,"" Hoyer said to reporters last week, ""let me say that at this point in time I would not support it. Let me tell you why I wouldn't. I really believed that if the country were in tough shape in 1995, we could get a three-fifths vote. I don't believe that today. I don't have any confidence that even at a time of great challenge, that there aren't 40 percent-plus in one House that would oppose doing something necessary to assure the country was on a sound footing."" That's one reason why this isn't going to work. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., provided another one. He supported the ""classic"" BBA, full-stop, and he was trying to get members to support it. ""I'm talking to people,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, this is such a polarized time. As opposed to looking at it as something good in the long term, for the fiscal health of the country, some people are looking at it as a sort of Republican victory. I'm just trying to get them past that. I say, 'Look: What about the Bush years? If we had this, he couldn't have had the tax cuts for the wealthy. We couldn't have had the unfunded wars.' That stops them short."" It probably won't stop enough of them short. The bad faith is tough to keep track of, but it's like this: Most Republicans want the Boehner debt plan to succeed, so they're willing to compromise a little on the balanced budget amendment. Democrats want the Boehner plan to fail, so that they get to vote on their plan instead, so they won't take the compromise. Boehner traded away nothing--a defeated BBA--for another kind of nothing, in the form of a BBA that helps him pass his debt plan in the House. That's the cruel way of putting it. It's not like Boehner is getting snowed; he's promising to ""take the fight"" on the balanced budget amendment to voters, who generally love it. In their press conferences this week, his leadership team started dropping references to it. On Wednesday, Rep. Cathy McMorris-Rodgers told reporters that Thomas Jefferson would have supported the amendment. That might be true. The Founders were more cynical than we want to give them credit for."	Republicans turn their attention to the balanced budget amendment.
8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/07/the_day_the_tea_party_grew_up.html	"One by one, the conservative stalwarts of the 112th Congress ascended a small stage and rallied their soldiers. Mike Lee! Rand Paul! Jim DeMint! Louie Gohmert! Steve King! Behind them: an impressive arrangement of the American flag and the Capitol dome. In front of them: about three dozen Tea Party activists, plus an equal number of reporters. The size of the crowd was less important than the message: Hold the line. This was a cross-Tea Party, cross-conservative movement event to make sure House and Senate Republicans did not relent in pressing for the ""Cut, Cap, and Balance"" plan, which passed the House but failed in the Senate. Oppose the Boehner plan, the compromise. Do what RedState, Heritage Action, FreedomWorks, Americans for Prosperity, and the Club for Growth are telling you. Or, you know, don't. ""Imagine having to negotiate with Barack Obama!"" said Rep. Joe Walsh, R-Ill., a confirmed ""no"" vote on the Boehner plan, banging the podium with his hand. ""Imagine having to negotiate with Harry Reid! Give John Boehner, give Eric Cantor, all the credit in the world. But embolden them! They need your help, we need your help."" They need help? Walsh made it clear that he was telling the crowd to stick with Cut, Cap, and Balance, but this was not the language of a conservative putsch. Not far away, presidential candidate Herman Cain was talking to supporters and reporters. (He would not speak at the rally, because of concerns over it becoming a ""campaign"" event.) What did ""hold the line"" mean to him? ""Don't raise the debt ceiling,"" he said. ""Don't raise tax rates. To me, that's holding the line. Now, whichever one of these plans does that, that's fine."" Even Cut, Cap, and Balance raised the debt ceiling, though, and he supported that. Did he fully oppose the Boehner plan? After all, it would cut spending, schedule a vote on a balanced budget amendment, and create a committee to fast-track painful reforms-- possibly Medicare cuts. The Boehner plan ""doesn't go far enough,"" he said. Would he challenge Boehner's leadership over the deal? ""No,"" he told reporters. Eight months ago, in an interview Democrats love to send around even more than they like to call Republicans ""extremists,"" Boehner predicted that the vote on the debt limit increase would be the ""first really big adult moment"" for new Republican members of Congress. Democrats read that as Boehner saying that Republicans would have to suck it up and raise the limit. Instead, it's turning out to be an entirely different kind of adult moment: Movement conservatives are seeing the value of playing politics, and trying to convince themselves that pure partisanship can be principled, too. For House Republicans, the day began with a conference meeting where the speaker told them to ""get their ass in line."" It was as literal as an ""adult moment"" can get. It won converts. Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., told reporters he was ""looking for a path to yes,"" which was something of an endorsement for a freshman from a safe Republican seat. He said he'd been given a quote from the evangelical leader Francis Schaeffer, and unfolded a piece of paper to get the quote right. "" 'If you are going to expect perfect or nothing, you will get nothing every time,' "" quoted Huizenga. He folded the paper. ""I don't want nothing. I want to make sure it's significant."" As the day went on, the conservatives holdouts were sounding glummer. After his Tea Party speech, Gohmert, R-Texas, shook his head and raised the specter of a Boehner win. ""After the conference this morning,"" he said, ""I think there are more people that will be supportive of this plan."" He excused himself to talk strategy with Cain. What were the risks for conservatives who bucked Boehner? They are pretty obvious to anyone who has paid attention for two years. The outside groups attacking a Boehner deal compared it to the situation that brought about TARP--panic, blamed on the Republicans, forcing them into a bad deal. In his own statement endorsing the Boehner plan, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., went out of his way to slay the TARP demon. ""They are quite simply wrong,"" said Issa of the critics. ""I was a leading opponent of TARP because it created a massive slush fund that invited abuse. ... The debate today is over how much spending will be cut in exchange for an increase in the debt limit. That is movement in the right direction."" But members of Congress lost their seats over TARP. There are votes that define careers. Sometimes, if you make the wrong choice, you lose your base forever. The universe of Republicans currently worried about that is fairly small. Rep. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., a libertarian icon who's running for Senate, said he was still leaning ""no"" on the Boehner plan. ""Unless they change, quite substantially, the current year figures on spending cuts, I just can't vote yes,"" he said. ""But I tell you, I don't begrudge those who are enthusiastically on board, saying this is the best deal we can get."" These aren't the sounds of a Republican revolt. By the end of Wednesday, Republicans were totally on message about how they chose the best of three plans (the others being Harry Reid's plan or default) and would push it through. Democrats obsessed over which conservative groups were most annoyed, and they were whipping their own votes to make the GOP's job harder. But it looks increasingly like the only win Democrats got was the Republican back-down from a ""grand bargain"" that would have raised the eligibility age for Medicare. The Tea Party won in 2010, said Dave Van Allen, a Virginia Tea Partier who'd made 50 ""Hold the Line"" T-shirts for protesters and just managed to give them all away. ""Winners don't compromise."""	How John Boehner is getting Republicans to unite behind his debt-ceiling plan.
9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/07/game_of_votes.html	"Rep. Peter Welch is ready to declare defeat. For months, the Vermont Democrat tried to give House Speaker John Boehner some breathing room, and pledge as many Democrats as possible--114 of them--to a ""clean"" vote on the debt limit. That plan was left for dead long ago. The discussion has moved on to a Republican plan that would raise the debt limit while requiring votes on a balanced-budget amendment and an entitlement-reform committee, or a Democratic plan that offers nothing but cuts. ""Elections have consequences,"" Welch said today, leaning on a table outside the floor of the House. ""And the House Republicans have been successful in getting two plans, Boehner and Reid, that are all cuts, no revenues, and a debate about doing this all at once or doing it in two stages. The Democratic approach was a balanced approach. We lost."" As Welch kept talking, this started to sound less and less like resignation. It sounded like a strategy. He and his pledgers are supposed to be the ones so worried about default that they'll vote to rescue Boehner. Not this time. He supports Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's plan, but not Boehner's, because Reid's plan doesn't touch entitlements. Why would Welch and his fellow Democrats matter at all for Boehner? Because Republicans were spending Tuesday, as they would be spending Wednesday, putting together 217 votes to pass the bill. Because right before Welch said this, Rep. Jim Jordan had spoken on behalf of his Republican Study Committee--the guys who brought you the ""Cut, Cap, and Balance Act,"" which calls for much steeper cuts than the Boehner plan calls for--and said, ""I am confident as of this morning that there were not 218 Republicans in support of this plan."" (Actually, because of two vacancies in the House, only 217 votes are needed to pass the bill.) The math is simple, or as simple as the voodoo of vote-counting can ever be. There are 240 Republicans in the House. Nine of them voted against the ""Cut, Cap, and Balance"" bill on the grounds that it didn't cut enough. That leaves 231 possible Republican votes, giving Boehner a 14-vote margin of error. Meanwhile, a total of 116 House Republicans signed the ""Cut, Cap, and Balance"" pledge (229 voted for the actual bill), showing their anti-tax, anti-spend bona fides, and a healthy percentage of them are predisposed to view the Boehner plan as insufficient. For Boehner's plan to succeed, then, one of two things needs to happen. Either a vast majority of Republicans needs to welsh on their pledge, or some House Democrats need to bail Boehner out. Who could those Democrats be? Good question! Five House Democrats voted for Cut, Cap, and Balance. For them, it was easy--the bill wasn't going to pass and it put them on record for a version of the ever-popular balanced-budget amendment. This vote isn't so easy. Only two of the five Democrats would talk about their current stance. According to Rep. Jim Matheson's office, he was ""still reviewing the language"" of Boehner's plan. According to Rep. Heath Shuler's office, he's simply against it. This is why Boehner was pulling out all the stops with the base. He spent part of Tuesday selling the plan to Rush Limbaugh. ""It's the moral obligation of government to pay its debts,"" he said, speaking as directly as he could to the party's base. At the website of the National Review, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the former director of the Congressional Budget Office and now full-time conservative economist, crunched the Boehner and Reid numbers and gave the speaker ""a strong B+."" Elsewhere on the website, Rep. Paul Ryan himself weighed in to support Boehner. The Chamber of Commerce backed the plan, as did Grover Norquist. In an afternoon press conference, Sen. Mitch McConnell called Norquist's endorsement ""the gold standard"" for members who were fretting that it cut too little, or that its bipartisan commission might end up recommending tax hikes. If this works, Republicans will keep plenty of leverage over the president and the Senate's hang-out-and-see caucus--also known as ""Democrats."" The last selling point of Cut, Cap, and Balance, which remains dead, was that it passed the House. If Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor can hector their conference into passing another bill--one that violates a pledge they just took!--then their new plan gets to be the basis for a new deal. Democrats can beat it in the Senate, but it would be them, not Republicans, holding up the beer summit and risking default. Republicans really want to be able to say that, because it's been their message for weeks, yet voters aren't buying it. ""If there's a crisis,"" Sen. Rand Paul said on Tuesday, ""the blame lies squarely on the shoulders of the president."" But what if Boehner's plan fails in the House? The GOP's leverage vanishes. Boehner will have failed to sell his plan to his own party. The next plan--Harry Reid's--becomes the most viable option left. Even Nancy Pelosi supports it, which suggests that most House Democrats could support it. The Reid plan, not the Boehner plan, becomes the basis for a deal. If that happens, Republicans might experience a sudden wave of nostalgia and regret. They didn't trust the president in his negotiations with Congress, and made that clear. But throughout that process it looked like Barack Obama might bow to the wisdom of newspaper op-ed pages and sign on to entitlement reform. There's no guaranteed entitlement reform in either of these plans--the fight over that is put off till next year. But there's no fight at all if Boehner loses his vote. And he might. On Tuesday, even before the CBO's assessment of the plan came out, conservative swing votes worried that Boehner's plan didn't do enough even to calm creditors. ""Look  at what Moody's and S&P actually say,"" said Rep. David Schweikert, R-Ariz., a freshman and former treasurer of Maricopa County. * ""It's not about the debt ceiling. It's about bending the debt curve. This bill, the bill we're seeing out of the Senate--neither of them seriously bend the debt curve. Congress may be about to embrace something that doesn't actually bend the debt curve in a legitimate fashion. Congress may be about to vote itself into a downgrade!""The last time Boehner pulled this off, he gave his party a deal at the 11th hour, saying it contained everything they could get. And he lost 54 votes. He can lose 23 this time. He'll have to do it after the first scoring of his bill found it wanting, after it's tweaked, and after it's scored again. Easy. Correction,  July 27, 2011: This article originally misidentified Rep. David Schweikert as a former state treasurer. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"	Debt-ceiling vote: Can John Boehner win it? What if he can't?
10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/07/kaboom.html	"Kaboom! The effort to reach a grand bargain on raising the debt ceiling blew up Friday evening. Before the pieces had even hit the ground, both White House aides and congressional Republicans were pointing to them as evidence that they were right and the other side was wrong. In his press conference, President Obama said Republicans wouldn't take yes for an answer. Republicans said the president pushed his luck, asking for tax increases which soured the deal at the last minute. Each side disputed the other's account. This battle of the reconstruction will go on for months. At the same time, amid the he said/he said squabbling, we know reasonably well what each side was willing to do, and what each was unwilling to do. How you assign blame depends on how you see the world. If you look to Washington for compromise in which each suffers some pain to get a mutually beneficial result, then you should credit the president for doing more than the Republicans. To anyone who has reported on this process over the last few months and in the fevered past few days, it was clear that Democrats were going to be taking the bigger hit to the things they cared about. Obama didn't even want spending reductions tied to the debt limit vote. The Tea Party changed the national political conversation. To catch up with the country's desire to cut spending, the president offered Republicans $3 trillion in cuts including offering to trim entitlements. His base, which includes people who think cuts of any kind are suicide, was furious at the size and kind of what Obama was offering. If you hold this view about the way Washington should work, then you will find the president's words at the end of his press conference stirring. He was as angry as he has ever been in public as he talked about ""ordinary folks who are struggling every day."" He continued: ""They know they're getting a raw deal, and they're mad at everybody about it. They're mad at Democrats and they're mad at Republicans, because they know somehow, no matter how hard they work, they don't seem to be able to keep up.  And what they're looking for is somebody who's willing to look out for them. That's all they're looking for."" House Speaker John Boehner, meanwhile, says the White House has ""refused to get serious about cutting spending."" That's not true. The White House was willing to cut $3 trillion and take on programs that are as cherished by Democrats as tax cuts are by Republicans. That's serious, though it may not have been as serious as Boehner would have liked. Still, if you look to Washington for opposition to tax increases, and to hold steadfast to this position even when public opinion is running against you, then you should reward Boehner. In this anti-tax worldview, the fact that Obama was willing to suffer a great deal more political pain is irrelevant, as are the niceties of compromise in divided government. The problem is the economy, and if you believe that tax increases of any kind will make the economy worse, then you are duty-bound to oppose them. It doesn't matter what the other side offers. Proof of how nervous Boehner was about losing support from the anti-tax caucus--which is to say, just about every Republican member of the House--came in several emails from his office arguing with the White House characterization of the deal as it was being negotiated. Boehner's office said that it was not true, for example, that he had considered letting the Bush tax cuts expire. To be seen as flirting with a tax increase is far worse than the benefit to be gained from being seen as flirting with compromise. The polls show that the majority of voters, and particularly independent voters, wanted a ""balanced approach,"" in the president's phrase. This should put Obama in a pretty good political position. But just because people have that opinion doesn't mean they will vote based on it. Those conservatives who hate taxes and who cheer Boehner, in contrast, are more likely to vote based on their opinions. It looked pretty depressing in Washington Friday night. Whichever way you see the world, Armageddon was still on the horizon with just 11 days to go. The president called congressional leaders into the White House for an 11 o'clock meeting Saturday morning to come up with a new agreement. Both sides said default was not an option. If this is really true then the anti-tax forces should feel encouraged. Their side is likely to win. With a fragile economy, the president can't risk not getting a deal. He would get the greater share of the blame if there was a failure. He'll either have to agree to a short-term deal, which he has said he would not agree to, or he'll agree to a lot of spending cuts with no tax increases, which will irritate if not infuriate his party. Whatever the final deal, few will be happy about it. Americans will have watched a process that will sour their mood even further. The accomplishment will simply be the bare minimum politicians could do. All of the points furiously being debated all week long and on Friday night will wither into a dull fight about what could have been. Become a fan of  John Dickerson on Facebook."	Debt talks collapse: Blame Boehner or blame Obama, no one is happy.
11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/07/pledge_kludge.html	"Washington is always thick with rumors--you can almost see them on the local Doppler. On Thursday afternoon, a rumor surfaced that President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner were close to a deal on raising the debt ceiling. The story was splashed across the home page of the New York Times. The markets appeared to react positively. When White House spokesman Jay Carney said there was no deal, he was then asked about a negative market reaction. Meanwhile, Boehner took to Rush Limbaugh's show to say there wasn't a deal. It was barely past lunch, but this rumor had already gone through three iterations: surfacing, backtrack, denial. And this was the second piece of speculation of the day: The morning had been dominated by talk about whether longtime anti-tax activist Grover Norquist had given House Republicans an opening to reach a deal with the president over tax increases. It's not just the heat. The atmosphere in Washington is particularly charged at the moment--almost to the point of general madness. Negotiators are working on a deal to avert a shutdown while simultaneously rushing to tamp down rumors about what they may or may not have agreed to. Much of the president's meeting Wednesday with Democratic leaders was spent assuring them that the rumors they had heard about the size of spending cuts were not true. The closer the Aug. 2 deadline for default, the more frantic all constituencies become. Everyone wants to get a jump on whatever might be in the deal so they can get it taken out. Democrats worry the president will stick them with drastic cuts to government services and entitlements. Republicans worry the speaker is agreeing to tax increases. Both sides worry they'll be presented with a last-minute deal they'll have to support or risk sending the country into economic ruin. The Norquist controversy that started the day marked a new stage in Norquist's already colorful career. For the last 25 years, Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, has encouraged Republican candidates to sign a pledge that they won't raise taxes. Some 236 members of the House have signed it. Many people (most of them Democrats) believe that this pledge is all that is blocking a debt limit deal between House Republicans and the White House. No House Republicans dare break the pledge by agreeing to any tax increases, or Norquist will punish them in the next election. Late Wednesday, a Washington Post editorial said that Norquist had essentially offered to let Republicans off the hook: The pledge, the editorial said, does not require signers to oppose the expiration of the Bush tax in 2012. Obama has been trying to get Republicans to agree to allow those tax cuts to expire in exchange for deep cuts in spending programs. Republicans have refused vehemently. Norquist said allowing these tax cuts to lapse ""would not technically violate the pledge."" If Republicans agree to let the cuts expire, the Post suggested, it would make a deal much easier and avert the crisis. Democrats reacted to the editorial only slightly slower than Wendi Deng Murdoch. On Thursday morning White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer highlighted the editorial. House Minority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters it was a major development. Sen. Chuck Schumer issued a press release and spoke about it on the Senate floor. ""This is a development the significance of which should not be underestimated. It is a recognition from Norquist that the House Republicans are increasingly isolated, and have painted themselves into a corner. Norquist is trying to signal to the House GOP that their no-compromise position is untenable, deteriorating, and bad for their party and the country."" Here's a good rule of thumb: When the Washington Post editorial board and the Democratic hierarchy agree on their textual analysis of a Republican stalwart, there's a pretty good chance it might not meet laboratory standards for dispassionate assessment. Still, Boehner at his morning news conference was asked two questions about the Norquist remarks. Boehner said he was not going to allow the Bush tax cuts to expire. What had Norquist actually said? The Post helpfully provided the audio later on Thursday. Norquist was making a narrow point about the language of the pledge. Written 25 years ago, it says that members promise not to vote for a net tax increase. It is silent on supporting legislation to block the expiration of cuts. But just because there is no sign saying you can't shoot your neighbor does not mean that you are free to do so. The expiration of the Bush tax cuts would mean a marginal tax rate increase, which Republicans believe is the most evil of all tax increases. You may remember the vigor with which Republicans fought Obama over letting these tax cuts expire last year. Norquist was a central combatant. Reducing marginal rates is the cause for which Norquist was called into this world. As Norquist said in the Post interview, the expiration of the Bush tax cuts would ""raise taxes from where they are"" and would ""be a very bad thing to do."" When the Post offered a hypothetical situation of a politician like Mitt Romney using the technicality to support the expiration, Norquist said he would ""denounce him as a tax increaser and a bad guy."" This is why all the activity Thursday morning was overheated. It is not realistic to think that a Republican member of Congress--formerly cowed by the Norquist pledge--would use this technicality as an opportunity to leap into newfound bravery. Nor is it realistic to think that he or she would do very well in the face of Norquist's promised denunciations. This kind of strict textual interpretation of the promise may have saved Antonio from losing his pound of flesh, but the laws of politics are a little looser than those of Venice. As Norquist said in the Post interview, ""You may get me to say technically you've done x,y, or z, but it doesn't pass the laugh test with the American people."" Norquist's pledge has power because Republicans who vote in primaries and conservative GOP districts don't want their members to vote for tax increases of whatever flavor. As he put it in an interview with me yesterday: ""The modern Republican Party is a different party than it was 10 years ago, it was a party that has got kinda slapped and said, 'Hey you, hear us: Spend less.' So those Democrats and moderate Republicans who are hoping for the good old days when Republicans would raise taxes for you are very old, because that happened 20-plus years ago and hasn't happened since."" Norquist shapes and uses that power--but he didn't create it, and he can't suddenly reverse course even if that were his intention (which it's not). If Obama is going to work out a deal with Republicans that wrings some savings out of changing the tax code, he's going to have to convince conservative Republicans that they won't get punished. At the moment that still looks about as easy as convincing people that the weather in Washington is lovely this time of year. Become a fan of  John Dickerson  on Facebook."	Debt negotiations: Would Grover Norquist really support a tax increase?
12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/07/big_is_the_new_black.html	"President Obama has tried to guilt, shame, and cajole House Republicans into a more flexible position on raising the debt limit. Lately his public statements have contained new pieces of evidence aimed to show House Republicans how isolated they are. Last week he mentioned the polls: Americans and a majority of Republicans support Obama's view that a final deal must include a mix of spending reductions and revenues from changes in the tax code. Today he took to the White House briefing room to herald a late-breaking bipartisan deficit-reduction agreement among six senators: ""We now have a bipartisan group of senators who agree with that balanced approach."" Tomorrow he may pick people out of the White House visitor's line: Mary Jones of Knoxville was just saying how much she wants us to put politics aside. ... And over here, Girl Scout Troop No. 32 supports a balanced approach! Can the president use the gravitational force of the center to lure Republicans his way? Probably not. But he may benefit from disagreement between Senate Republicans and their more hard-line colleagues in the House, where the only thing worse than raising government revenue is cutting spending too little. Last week the attempt to put together a ""grand bargain"" that included trillions in spending cuts and about a trillion in new revenue looked doomed. Senior Republican aides in the Senate were declaring the White House talks irrelevant. Time had run out, and the only way to avoid an economic catastrophe was a ""failsafe"" deal being put together by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Majority Leader Harry Reid. The proposal would raise the debt limit, but include no spending cuts. There would be a committee of senators to propose reductions Congress could vote on. House Republicans balked. For a brief moment there was hope that some could be bought off by including some spending cuts in the failsafe plan. But as White House and Hill negotiators talked about those cuts they ran into a problem: Nothing would satisfy conservatives. The cuts either wouldn't be substantial enough, or they would be made up of savings on interest, revenue from asset sales, and other measures that wouldn't actually curb the size of government. Plus, some spending reductions would be in areas like agriculture, cuts that Republicans find hardest to swallow. Tuesday, 60 House Republicans delivered a letter to Speaker John Boehner asking that the McConnell plan not even be brought up for a vote. So now that McConnell's face-saving deal looks as hard to get as the big deal, the big deal is back in play (at least for this sliver of the news cycle). All along the president has been saying that since a small deal was just as hard as a big one, why not go for the big one and at least get the credit? Yes, such a deal would require some kind of creative tax solution that would appeal to the president's desire for balance. But it would also allow fiscal hawks to point to a big amount of savings as well as cuts in entitlement spending, which they have long sought. Whether the minds of House conservatives can be changed requires Congress first dispensing with the ""Cut, Cap and Balance Act."" It is the most austere of the budget-reduction measures that would cut discretionary spending, limit future growth, and begin the process of passing a balanced budget amendment. It will fail in the Senate--and only after it does, say House Republican aides, can leaders begin anew the talk about what legislation can actually pass. Recalcitrant members can tell their constituents that they fought for the most severe measures, but when it failed they took the biggest deal they could get. Will that deal suddenly emerge around the new Gang of Six plan in the Senate? Though the president said he supported it, he also said he hadn't studied its details. His spokesman then held a briefing in which he repeatedly said White House aides hadn't had a chance to look at it. But the details aren't important. In fact, for the purposes of the Tuesday afternoon drama, the details are an obstacle. All that's important is that the agreement cuts the deficit using increased tax revenues and spending reductions, which is the demand the president is making of Republicans. There was another reason to stay vague. If the president puts his fingerprints on specifics in public it will sour the chance for negotiators to work out the terms of a deal in private. Though Republicans have been clamoring for the president to release details of his plan for reducing the government in public, all parties know that this vagueness gives everyone maximum flexibility in the negotiating room. Boehner's spokesman pointed out the deal resembled the one Boehner had been working on with Obama before negotiations fell apart with a mix of entitlement reductions and tax reform. Majority Leader Eric Cantor issued a press release saying vague but positive things about it. In a process where proposals have been rejected out of hand, these were positive signs to deal-makers. There are so many tracks now in the debt-limit talks we may need a national conductor. White House and House GOP sources say both sides are still trying to find a grand bargain. McConnell and Reid continue to work on their plan despite Tea Party roars. The Senate's Gang of Six is trying to figure out whether its plan has any actual support, and if so, if its provisions could be put into legislative language. The ""Cut, Cap and Balance"" pantomime continues. Meanwhile we're 14 days away from the Aug. 2 deadline for default. If anyone else has a deal out there, bring it forward. Surely we're going to move to the winnowing stage soon. Become a fan of  John Dickerson  on Facebook."	"Debt negotiations: The ""grand bargain"" between Obama and Republicans is back in play."
13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/07/hard_nuts_to_crack.html	"Presidents like to say that they don't pay too much attention to polls. Today Barack Obama read them out loud. ""Poll after poll, many done by your organizations, show that it's not just Democrats who think we need to take a balanced approach,"" he said at his news conference. ""It's Republicans as well."" The ""balanced approach"" the president was referring to is a mix of spending reductions and tax increases as part of a deal to raise the debt ceiling. The polls are striking. Only 26 percent of Republicans in a recent Gallup poll agree with Republican leaders that an increase in the debt ceiling should be linked only to spending cuts. A Quinnipiac poll shows a similar result. Was the president offering a hard-line negotiating position to pressure Republicans into a larger deal? Or was he foreshadowing the campaign rhetoric he will use if such a deal isn't reached? The answer is both. The president argued that Republicans were out of touch with the voters, an argument the GOP successfully used against the president in the 2010 election. ""The proposal that I was discussing with Speaker Boehner fell squarely in line with what most Republican voters think we should do.  So the question is at what point do folks over there start listening to the people who put them in office?  Now is a good time."" The president outlined three options in his news conference: a big deal--the so-called ""grand bargain"" of spending cuts and revenue increases approaching $4 trillion; a medium deal that would cover the amount the debt limit would need to be raised to keep everyone from having to address the issue again before the next election; and a failsafe plan. The failsafe plan would be built upon the offering earlier in the week by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell that would require the president to ask for an increase in the debt limit three times before the next election. Republicans could vote against the increase, but it wouldn't keep it from happening. Added to the McConnell plan would be a commission, offered by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and modeled after the Pentagon's Base Closure and Realignment Commission, which would designate spending cuts that Congress could only vote up or down. This failsafe plan would be enacted only to avoid ""Armageddon,"" the president said, meaning a possible default Aug. 2, after which the Treasury Department would have to start prioritizing payments and choosing which of the government's obligations not to meet. In advance of such a bleak scenario, the president said he was still pushing for a larger deal, and pointed to the polls to argue that Republicans really should come to their senses. The argument isn't going to work. Not even close. On Friday afternoon, it was hard to pull apart the string of conflicting reports about where negotiations stood, but the clouds were definitely dark. Even the failsafe plan was looking troubled.  Conservative Republicans in the House were saying that the failsafe's option of future spending cuts wasn't enough. They want immediate cuts. Administration officials were working with House leaders on a package of spending cuts to add to the plan that would appease enough Republicans to get 218 votes in the House without losing too many Democrats. Under this gloomy view, the ""balanced approach"" the president was talking about will have gone out the window. That will leave him with the least attractive option--a deal to put this whole issue off till after 2012--but a political issue for the campaign. He can make the case that he was willing to anger his own base by considering a raise in the retirement age for Social Security or means-testing for Medicare benefits, but Republicans were not willing to offend their ideological base. ""I think increasingly the American people are going to say to themselves, you know what, if a party or a politician is constantly taking the position 'my way or the highway,' constantly being locked into ideologically rigid positions, that we're going to remember at the polls."" This is the ""wise man in the middle"" posture we've seen the president take before. It's an appealing position to independent and moderate voters, who are sick of partisanship. It also helps the president push back against the idea that he is a big-spending liberal. And it helps him paint Republicans as so captive to their Tea Party wing (the 26 percent that wants no tax increases) that they are unwilling to entertain one penny of shared sacrifice. Amid all the tick-tock coverage of the daily negotiations and dueling press conferences, it can be hard to appreciate how much both sides have evolved. Exactly three months ago, the White House was pressing for ""a clean vote"" on increasing the debt limit, with no spending cuts attached. Republicans were opposed. On Friday Obama argued that an increase in the debt ceiling should be accompanied by spending cuts. It's the Republican leader of the Senate who has essentially proposed a ""clean vote."" For all its partisanship, this debate has shown how Republicans and Democrats can easily switch sides. Become a fan of  John Dickerson  on Facebook."

14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/07/debtors_prison.html	"Near the end of The Dark Knight, the Joker comes up with a brilliant plan to befuddle Batman and the police. Instead of ordering his henchmen to stand over their hostages, he forces the hostages to stand up and point phony guns at the henchmen. From afar--from, say, a sniper's scope--it looks like the hostages are actually the people to take out. The gambit doesn't work, for complicated and irrelevant reasons that raise serious questions about spying and cell phone security. It's still a useful way of understanding the switcheroo that Republicans are trying to engineer in the debate over the debt limit. So far their ruse is as unsuccessful as the Joker's was. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, is a Tea Party freshman who's started to speak out on a number of constitutional issues. On Wednesday afternoon, after a meeting with fellow Republican senators, Lee told reporters that Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's plan to shift responsibility for the debt limit from Congress to the president was unacceptable. It gave up the GOP's leverage to push through reforms. ""Why is the president willing to push us into a debt-ceiling-induced financial shortfall by virtue of the fact that he's not willing to convince his party to support a balanced-budget amendment?"" asked Lee. ""What is so wrong with that request that the president is willing to withhold Social Security payments to current retirees?"" Reporters blanched. One asked whether he was accusing the president of holding the country hostage. ""Yes!"" said Lee. ""That's exactly what I'm saying. That's absolutely what I'm saying."" What do you need to believe in order to agree with Lee? You need to believe that the Treasury Department is lying about the difficulty of re-jiggering mandatory payments to Social Security recipients, veterans, and everyone else. You also need to believe that the White House relishes a fight that makes Republicans look like zealots ready to risk default for a few days in order to make a point about spending. The first part of that isn't true. The best evidence Republicans have for it is a Goldman Sachs report--and sure, those guys are trustworthy, right?--which theorizes that the Treasury could avoid default if it prioritized different kinds of spending. The same report warns that this would happen amid a ""huge, immediate fiscal retrenchment,"" and less rosy reports remind us that the Treasury would need to stall some 40 percent to 45 percent of 80 million mandatory monthly payments. And the second part of the argument is hard to comprehend. How could President Obama have so badly misread the debt fight and the GOP's leverage eight months ago if he was gearing up for the battle today? Republicans have done well in the debt fight so far. For months they made sure the debate was on their terms: The debt vote was leverage to force Washington to embrace austerity. The McConnell gambit and the ""hostage"" charge--made by Michele Bachmann just a few hours before it was made by Lee--represent a rethink. This is dangerous stuff to debate. It's not good to be indifferent (or at least feign indifference) about a possible downgrade in America's credit rating, and then have Moody's come out and say it's got doubts about America's credit rating. Republicans have a problem: You can't run the McConnell play and the Bachmann/Lee play at once. For weeks, conservatives have used the debt fight to garner support for a ""Cut, Cap, and Balance"" pledge, promising their votes for an increase only if those three verbs were taken seriously and forcefully. They're not concealing their fear that the McConnell punt takes away their leverage. When I asked Tea Party leaders about which plan they preferred, they all sided with Bachmann/Lee against McConnell. ""There's a cost/benefit analysis here,"" said Max Pappas, who runs FreedomWorks' PAC. FreedomWorks responded to the McConnell idea, within minutes, by asking supporters to melt Senate GOP phone lines with strangled cries of, ""No!""; on Thursday, its members will haunt the offices of some Democratic members of Congress to work them over, too. ""If they voted for this, they'd be voting to cede constitutionally granted power from Congress to the executive. I can't see that as something we'd look favorably on,"" Pappas said. ""We don't care who owns what or which party's to blame for what."" Sal Russo, the political guru for the Tea Party Express, saw McConnell's point. ""There is an appeal to putting the blame for a failure to address our skyrocketing national debt and excessive spending on Obama,"" he said. ""But the situation is too critical to not take immediate steps to reign in this fiscal disaster. So we think cuts and spending limits should be addressed now."" ""If Congress passed [McConnell's] proposal into law,"" said Jenny Beth Martin of Tea Party Patriots, the movement's umbrella group, ""they would be abdicating their duty as prescribed in the Constitution. While there may be political advantages to one party or another with the maneuvering, proposals, and backroom deals, we are concerned with what is advantageous to Americans regardless of political party."" The Tea Party actually believes this--and if he were sufficiently devious, any Republican strategist should be able to see the position's merit. All of the debt ceiling compromises discussed so far are a horrible deal for Obama. They give him partial ownership of a plan that cuts both entitlements and any economic growth that was being spurred by government spending. McConnell actually admitted this in an interview with Laura Ingraham. ""They want to blame the economy on us,"" he said, explaining why he wanted to punt. ""The reason that default is no better an idea today than when Newt Gingrich tried it in 1995 is that it destroys your brand and would give the president an opportunity to blame us for the bad economy. Look, he owns the economy. He's been in office nearly three years now. We refuse to let him entice us in to co-ownership of a bad economy."" It was of a piece with what John Boehner's been saying for months: that Republicans, who can and do stop whatever legislation they please, only control ""one-half of one-third of the government."" If you buy that, it's possible that the president really is holding America hostage over the debt ceiling. But why, at this point, would you buy it?"	Debt talks: Republicans back themselves into a corner.
15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/08/the_rick_perry_show.html	"WATERLOO, Iowa--When Rick Perry arrived at the Electric Park Ballroom last night, he already looked like a veteran presidential candidate. His Texas security detail--focused men in dark suits--moved quietly around him. His aides spoke into microphones in their sleeves. Forty or so members of the press swarmed Perry at the door and then shuffled along together while he talked to voters. Weeks ago, the organizers of the Black Hawk County Lincoln Day dinner thought that they would have to rely on an impersonator of the 16th president for entertainment. Instead, the circus came to town. For a night, the dimly lit ballroom was the center of GOP politics. Once Perry announced that he was coming, Rep. Michele Bachmann said she would attend. Sen. Rick Santorum also made a late entry, in order to be near the cameras that he complains don't follow him. This is the new pace of the GOP presidential campaign. Within the last 48 hours, Michele Bachmann has become the front-runner in Iowa, Perry has started his campaign, and Tim Pawlenty has ended his. In the coming weeks, Perry will be in a hurry to make up for lost time. Bachmann will hustle to counter him in Iowa to keep from losing Tea Party support. Mitt Romney, who has been cautious and measured this summer, may feel the pressure to react to Perry if he starts gaining traction. And Perry, the governor of Texas, looks like the kind of candidate who can get traction. He knows how to work a room. He moves his face close to voters, sometimes draping himself over them like a blanket. Though the press mob made it hard for him to move through the narrow spaces between the tables, his team knew how to keep him moving. Security gently cleared the way, guided by whatever incantations his political team whispered into their earpieces. They spotted Chuck Grassley, Iowa's senior senator, and the governor was piloted in that direction. At another point, Perry, who had been diligently working each table, skipped a few to shake the hand of a young African-American man. They clutched while the cameras flashed and whirred. Maybe Perry was genuinely happy to greet this man, Michael Anthony. At the same time, like all good politicians, he knows a good photo op when he sees one. Afterward, I asked Anthony whether he'd ever met Perry. He hadn't. He assumed the affection was for the cameras: ""Come on, I'm the only black man in the room."" Retail politics isn't everything, but in Iowa and New Hampshire, it's a big deal. Grassley said his main piece of advice when Perry called him to talk about running was that he needed to show up and meet voters. When the two met in the crowded ballroom, Perry was anxious to show he'd gotten the message. ""Trust me, I'll be here often,"" he told Grassley. Perry's speech was energetic and well-received. He roamed the stage and punctuated his points with a variety of the gestures in his considerable arsenal. ""Sometimes it takes me a while to get into something,"" he said, after describing the 16 years he'd known his wife before marrying her. ""But let me tell ya: When I'm in, I'm in all the way."" As he worked his way to the punch line he sat as if appearing to go into chair pose. Perry's started with protein-rich Powerbar of biography--growing up in Paint Creek, Texas, a town without a ZIP code, farming cotton with little rain, his achievements in 4-H and the Boy Scouts, flying jets in the Air Force. He didn't take on any of his opponents. It's way too early for that. The lines of distinction were obvious, though. He stressed his record of creating jobs--the central question in the campaign. He promised to cut government spending, and if Congress didn't go along, he would use his veto pen ""until the ink went dry."" Perry's threat to Romney is that he has more relevant executive experience: He has used government to help create jobs. His threat to Bachmann is that he is a better voice for the Tea Party. That's her signature claim, and Perry tried his hand at it. Identifying himself with the movement, he addressed accusations that ""Tea Party types"" are angry. ""We're not angry, we're indignant,"" he said. ""We're indignant at the arrogance and the audacity that this administration is showing about the values that are important to the good people of America."" The speech was bumpy at times. He pledged that when he became president members of the military would once again have someone they respected in the Oval Office. That's a pretty serious charge to make both about the commander in chief and the military, which drills its members to respect the president no matter what. Also, he may want to lose that line about how the wrinkles in his shirt were not his wife's fault--at least by the time he gets to the general election and starts going after those suburban swing-voting women. Bachmann spent less than one-quarter of the time that Perry did with voters, though of course she had just spent weeks campaigning with a personal touch in the runup to the straw poll. She stressed her local roots, having been born in Waterloo: ""I'm not a politician, I'm a real person ... raised by real people."" It was a glancing shot at both Perry and Romney, whose looks and manners appear to come from central casting. It will be a neat piece of jujitsu if a member of Congress can play the outsider against a governor and former governor. Usually, it's the other way around.

""Do you know what the schedule is after this is done?"" ""This"" is an address from Herman Cain, the first in a series of Friday speeches from GOP candidates at the Iowa State Fair. Deregger and Rick Titus, self-employed friends from northern Iowa, had been enjoying it, which everyone present could tell, because they had the biggest voices in a sleepy midmorning crowd. When Cain said his father earned money the old-fashioned way--""he worked for it!""--Titus let loose with a massive ""Yeeeeeee-haw!"" Cain said he knew how Washington worked. ""It doesn't!"" Deregger howled with approval. I wrote down the schedule of the next few speakers. Thaddeus McCotter at 11, Rick Santorum at 11:30, Ron Paul at noon, Newt Gingrich at 2:30, Michele Bachmann at 4. Deregger eyed it with a look that was half-disinterest and half-confusion--""who is Magutter?""--before he saw Ron Paul's name. ""That's who I'm voting for,"" he tells me. ""Cain was saying the right stuff up there, but Paul's my guy."" ""The rest of these guys are just status quo,"" says Titus. ""Paul's the only one who's talking about the bankers and the Fed."" He pulls out a dollar bill and points to the words Federal Reserve Note. ""It's not a note!"" he says. ""Do you see an expiration date on there?"" Titus and Deregger exemplify one of the three breeds of Iowa Republican voters. They're die-hards, with unchangeable opinions about the candidate they landed on months or years ago. They have fears; no one else speaks to them. They'll wait for the caucuses, show up, go home. At this moment in Iowa, the only sure-thing voters are the people voting for Ron Paul, which is one reason Republicans keep predicting that he'll win Saturday's straw poll. (The other reason is that they want it to be news if someone else wins.) The two other breeds are the undecideds and the settlers. There's some overlap between them. Many of the undecideds say that they haven't heard from, or of, all the candidates yet. They have trouble naming them. They double-check with reporters to see who is running. What about the Iowans who are already settling for a candidate? They like one or two of their current choices, but they're not sold on them yet. They want to hear more about Rick Perry, about whom they know almost nothing, or they want some kind of decision from Sarah Palin, about whom they know everything. ""I want to know more about Perry,"" says Frank Dailey, who ponders the question alongside his wife, Linda. Both are wearing shirts with American flag colors and the slogan You Are Not ENTITLED to What I Earn. ""Everything I've heard about his record in Texas is very good."" But what about Perry's decision to jump into the race as the Ames Straw Poll is happening? Isn't that an insult to Iowa voters? ""I think that's something you guys in the media care about,"" he says. Iowans always engage in some fantasizing before they drive themselves over to the caucuses. There were polls well into 2003 showing that Al Gore or Hillary Clinton could win the Democratic nomination. (A lot of good that did her in 2008.) Republicans hated having to choose between McCain, Romney, and Huckabee in 2007, and for a brief, delirious moment, 27 percent of them said they  wanted Fred Thompson to jump into the race and save them. He jumped into the race. He didn't save them. The backers of Mitt Romney and Tim Pawlenty like to remember all that. Their support is soft, sure. But candidates flop all the time. Celebrities take passes at running all the time. This is a problem they can endure; they will eventually start grabbing the votes of those settlers. As the Daileys walk away, Cain is long gone. The barely known McCotter ascends the stage and takes his place behind its immaculately arranged hay bales. A small number of fair-goers get to hear his monotone warnings about how America could follow Europe's lead into collapse. A man named Ronald Van Genderen rested his hands on his folding chair and explained to McCotter that he wanted a candidate who came from the middle class. It sounded like the candidate had made a sale. Nope. ""I want Palin in there,"" says Van Genderen. ""If she ran, she would win."" What about the polling that suggests she couldn't? ""Why?"" he snorts. ""Because people can't corner her. She's too honest. She's too Christian. Her personality is terrific. That's why they don't like her. What did the media do, go after 1,500 pages of her emails? Why did they do that? They're out to get her."" Santorum is next onstage, making the electability argument that Van Genderen didn't buy. ""There was a poll last week that had Barack Obama and Rick Santorum in a dead heat in Pennsylvania,"" he says. ""I was the only conservative elected in 2000 in a state that George W. Bush lost. What does the national media have against a conservative who can win?"" At the moment, the national media isn't paying attention to him because  Sarah Palin has arrived at the state fair. She's far away from the speakers, over at the Hall of Champions, where an array of prize-winning animals is overwhelmed by reporters scurrying to get a look at Palin and toss questions at her. Most of the GOP field is 10 minutes away, and no one cares, because  she's here. ""After she resigned, you said that she was washed-up and done, right?"" Todd Palin tells CNN. ""And you guys are still here."" The media are going where the voters are. The fair-goers who can figure out Palin's location come away literally yelping with delight holding newly signed fair programs. Middle-aged women on scooters hoist their smartphones to snap photos. One young girl, who happened to bring George W. Bush's memoirs to the fair, angles over to get Palin to sign them. Julie Streblow bounds away from the Palin mob with a fresh signature, gushing about the encounter. ""I told her I loved her TV show, and I wanted her in the White House!"" says Streblow. ""Now that I've seen here, I really want her to be president."" ""It really makes a difference when you shake someone's hand,"" suggests her friend Deb Waterman. Palin slowly, slowly moves out of that scrum, into a VIP section of the fair and out of sight. Later, when she and Todd and her security team walk the main street of the fair, the crowd is at least eight people deep. The Palin mob shuffles down the street like a drunken, sluggish beast, microphones and cameras sticking out at random angles as the crowd swells. Right at the other end of the street, Michele Bachmann is arriving--late--for her own speech. Here's somebody who has die-hard support like Ron Paul, who can win the votes of people who will eventually settle for someone who's not Palin. ""Meet me in Ames!"" says Bachmann. ""We're going to have country superstar Randy Travis!"" A woman in a tie-dyed shirt cuts through the crowd, sees the stage, and wants to say something inspiring. ""You go, Sarah!"""	Republicans swoon for Sarah Palin at the Iowa State Fair.

He walks into the headquarters of Vermeer, a manufacturer that employs more people than any other company in this small city, and sees a concrete wall embedded with little knickknacks and propellers and widgets. It looks like a particularly wide, and particularly grim, rock-climbing wall. ""So it looks like you've put some components in the concrete!"" says Romney. ""That's pretty fun!"" It's the ""fossil wall,"" explains his guide, studded with trinkets from the company's products. ""There are employees who can point to that and say, 'I know what that goes to.' "" ""Isn't that something!"" says Romney. He gets to the conference room where 14 local business leaders and about three times that number of reporters are waiting for him. He contemplates the checked shirt and khakis he's put on today. ""I left my sport coat in the car,"" says Romney. ""But I guess you won't mind if I'm underdressed!"" This is a room full of people who are paid to outthink other businesses, and people who are paid to be cynical. There's no reason to believe that Romney forgot the jacket. He is making only three stops on this trip--four if you count his second televised debate appearance Thursday night. He flew down from Chicago in coach, and he'll be shuttling to his events in a regular-sized SUV; there's no bus with a Death Star-sized painting of his face, no stadium sound. His challenge is to look and sound low-key without sounding like he's phoning it in. That means shirtsleeves. The event is coordinated to provide a minimum of news. Romney, at the head of the table, asks the businessmen to tell him ""what we can do in Washington to make the private sector more competitive globally."" ""When I go across the country and I hear from small businesses,"" he says, ""time and again--I hear, 'Gosh, I used to be getting loans from my community bank, and I can't anymore. They're not loaning money.' Time and time again. Then I meet with bankers, and I say, I'm hearing this. Why is that? They say they don't know which regulations are coming down the pike."" He promises to sit back and listen. ""I'm Denny Van Zanten from the Pella Corporation,"" says Denny Van Zanten of the Pella Corporation. ""Denny!"" says Romney. ""You've talked about the uncertainty,"" says Van Zanten. ""What can we do to have some teamwork between the government to get rid of some of that and to create a positive attitude right here in the ol' U.S. of A?"" Romney nods thoughtfully over an hour of short statements like this. After each of the masters of industry and banking speak, he shares a minute or so of wisdom. ""There is the perception--and in my view, the reality--that the administration has been an anti-business administration,"" he says. ""What the administration needs to be doing is working out trade agreements. Now, I'll see if I've got the correct numbers, but I believe that Asian and European countries have added 47 bilateral trade agreements in the last two and a half years. And we've added none."" Why can't the whole caucuses process be so civilized? When Romney wraps, electronics- component manufacturer and winery owner Robert Wersten talks about how clearly superior this guy is for the presidency, and how it might not matter. ""You get to see the inside of the Republican Party in these caucuses,"" he says. ""My wife and I will go, and often there'll be five or six of us, total, who are making arguments and talking. And then there'll be a bunch of ninnies who just make arguments and don't reason with anyone."" In 2007, Mitt Romney introduced himself to Iowans with millions of dollars in TV ads, an overwhelming campaign to win the straw poll, and gimmicks like a 99-county bus tour led by his son Josh. (""We think he's still in the 98th county somewhere,"" jokes Romney's eldest son, Tagg, along for the ride today.) That effort, according to Republicans here, gave Romney a floor of support that you can see in polls--around 20 percent or so, enough to finish in the top three of Iowa with a little work. How much is a little? Romney  is skipping the straw poll this year, to spend money on ""contests that will select some delegates,"" and also to avoid another situation like 2007, where he dumped enough cash to win the informal poll of Republican voters only to watch the media reward the second-place finisher. Let Michele Bachmann own the hype. Let Tim Pawlenty rent his old campaign office, do Mike Allen's ""Playbook"" breakfast, and build a double-digit paid staff. (So far, Romney has three full-time Iowa staffers.) Let Rick Perry come here on Sunday and start from scratch. Romney can be the candidate of the anti-ninnies. Sarah Palin came to Pella and had a block party/pity-fest for a  documentary that ended up flopping. Romney comes here, talks to masters of industry, and scoots. ""The president said if he didn't turn the economy around in three years, he'd be looking at a one-term proposition,"" says Romney after the roundtable. ""Well, it's almost three years. He's looking at a one-term proposition."" On Wednesday the campaign is still  celebrating a Politico feature that described a panicky, resigned White House assuming that Romney will be the Republican nominee. It's not an official celebration; officially, there's outrage that some anonymous Democrat used the word kill--instead of the more appropriate post-Giffords-shooting crush or smother--to describe the anti-Romney plan. There's no attempt to tamp down  speculation over the word ""about a dozen"" Democrats used to describe Romney: weird. There are analysts who think weird is code for Mormon. Another possibility: It could describe a candidate who looks at a wall of art and describes it as ""components,"" who's selling himself as a Moses come to lead the jobless schlub and the panicky, uncertainty-haunted businessman out of the desert. Romney leaves Pella and makes his way an hour up the road to Des Moines. He's the honored guest at a Polk County Republican fundraiser at the home of Nick Van Patten, a wholesaler of home products who flits around the party in a pinstriped suit. As they wait for Romney, the guests (they paid at least $50 for tickets) play bocce ball, eat mini-pulled-pork sandwiches, or ask Fox News reporter Carl Cameron to pose for pictures near his camera setup at the pool. Newt Gingrich, Michele Bachmann, and other candidates have already been to previous county party fundraisers, and these people aren't necessarily sold on Romney yet. ""He's got a big fish hook in him,"" warns Jack Salzeider, a commodities trader who wears one ring made of gold from the Black Hills of South Dakota and one ring that contains a slice of every stone that's mined in Arizona. ""That's Romneycare. I'm still waiting to hear from Rick Perry--he might be the guy."" As the party goes on, Politico will  drop another story about Romney that these voters won't like. In 2004, when he made a pitch to Standard & Poor's that got them to raise Massachusetts's credit rating, tax hikes were part of the offer. Romney only spent four years in elective office, and these are the sorts of problems he has to overcome: He cut deals. But compare that to Romney's problem last time around: He saw an opening to run to the right of John McCain and Rudy Giuliani on social issues, got there, and then discovered that Mike Huckabee had already bought up all the real estate. He was attacked as wishy-washy on Iraq--remember that?--because he wasn't as supportive of the troop surge as McCain was. Now all anyone's worried about is the economy. Romney can handle that. He takes the stage in Nick Van Patten's backyard and promises the businessmen and investors that he's going to listen to them. ""I like you guys!"" says Romney. ""I don't think the president likes you very much!"" This is a joke. ""I'm only kidding about that. But I like you people. I like that you pay taxes. I like that you grow our economy. He's looking ahead. In a brief, 12-minute address, Romney doesn't tell anyone to go vote for him in the straw poll. ""I need a few votes,"" he says. ""I want to get the delegates from Iowa."""	Mitt Romney in Iowa: A low-key campaign to befriend every businessman in the state.
18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/08/we_were_right_all_along.html	"COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa--Michele Bachmann wants Iowa to know that she was right all along. ""I went back to Washington not once, not twice, not three times--I went back to Washington four times to vote 'no' on raising the debt ceiling!"" she says. There are more than 70 people listening to this message. It's hot. She ran a little late. Some of them volunteered to sit to Bachmann's left or right to hold signs behind her, but most are in the shade. They're not reacting or applauding yet. ""What we saw last week is the markets agreed with me,"" says Bachmann. ""The markets saw what happened in Washington when Obama got a $2.4 trillion check. And one thing you learned is you can't fool the markets! The politicians were busy applauding themselves! They were patting each other on the back! They were saying, 'Didn't we do a great job! We just raised the debt ceiling!' How did that make you feel?"" Booooo! There's the reaction. Over the course of 25 minutes, the GOP's co-frontrunner finds space for all of her usual applause lines: There aren't any czars on our campaign bus! ... In a Michele Bachmann administration, there won't be any teleprompters! ... We're going to make sure Barack Obama is a one-term president! The winning argument, the one she keeps returning to, is the saga of Michele and the Debt Limit. She followed her instincts. Iowa Republicans shared those instincts. They were right, and the elitists were wrong. (When aren't they wrong?) They promised that if the debt limit got hiked, rating agencies would go back to sleep. They didn't. Standard & Poor's lowered America's bond rating from AAA to AA+. ""It was lowered for the first time in American history!"" says Bachmann. ""We kept that rating during the Great Depression. We kept it during World War II. We kept it during Vietnam. We kept it after nine-one-one."" (This is how Bachmann pronounces 9/11.) Her would-be supporters, her would-be Ames Straw Poll voters, grimace and nod. They wish they weren't so right about all this. Spending cuts or no, the debt limit ""never should have been raised,"" sighs Anita Cote, who's come to the rally with her husband. A few years back they sold their clothing store and retired, and they had been doing well, but they have friends who aren't thriving. They see the spending coming out of Washington and identify a culprit. ""You'd never run a business that way, and the people didn't want it to be raised."" The second part of that is true. That's part of the happy paradox that Bachmann and her congressional colleagues have created in Iowa. In polls, voters who'd never really been asked the question before said that they didn't want the debt ceiling increased. It was never clear whether they knew what this meant or whether they knew that no existing deficit-reduction plan--not Paul Ryan's, not Rand Paul's--worked without a debt-ceiling hike that allowed America to pay its obligations. They just didn't like the sound of it, which gave Bachmann an advantage as she inveighed against it. Then came the downgrade. In S&P's words, this had something to do with the debt itself, and something to do with fear that ""the majority of Republicans in Congress continue to resist any measure that would raise revenues."" In Bachmann's words, it was all about Obama. The idea that Republican intransigence had anything to do with it was nuts. She describes the speech that the president had given shortly before this event started. ""Essentially,"" she says, ""what the president said is this: The markets reacted because we had a debate in Congress over whether we should raise the debt ceiling. So apparently the markets and the rating agencies decided to punish Congress and all of you because you didn't want the debt ceiling raised. Are you kidding me?"" It's cynical, and it works. This is the second version of the speech I've heard today, and both times I've talked to voters who are basically despondent about the debt downgrade. It's a body blow. Bachmann compounds the negative feeling voters get when they hear ""downgrade"" by evoking the primal fear of China--the communists could take this opportunity to surpass the United States. The voters get even more worried, talking about how much money they've lost in their retirement plans as a result of the turmoil of July. ""I don't even want to look at my 401(k),"" sighed Norman Mills, a retired salesman, when Bachmann gave the speech in the small town of Atlantic, Iowa. ""You can see why S&P did what they did. There's too much uncertainty. There's billions of dollars not going into the market because people are so worried about the regulations that could be coming on."" Many of the people who show up at her rallies Monday say they're still shopping around, and enough of them say they're looking at Rick Perry to make it seem like he could stop her surge by getting into the race. Still: All of these people agree with Bachmann's arguments. After she blisters Barack Obama for spending, then attacks him for ""stealing"" $500 billion from Medicare to pay for health care reform, no one sees a contradiction. They say that money was for people who'd paid into the system; the cuts can come from other programs. The candidate they're having this conversation with has an impressive road show. When she finishes her speech in Council Bluffs, a team of grips starts loading a stage, two tents, an American-flag sign, and a jungle of A/V cables into a truck. One of them tells me his last job was working on Transformers: Dark of the Moon. Two Bachmann aides with iPads strapped to their hands like catcher's mitts mill around the crowd, signing people up to vote for Bachmann in the straw poll. They offer paper tickets, too, glossy things that promise free food and a Randy Travis concert at the Ames Straw Poll. ""I'm going to take you on a date!"" jokes Bachmann. ""I'm paying!"" There's still a little dissent. Ron Romine, a Council Bluffs retiree who works one day a week in a Western clothing store, frowns beneath his black cowboy hat. Obama's quote about Congress inciting the downgrade doesn't seem so crazy to him. ""That's one of the only things that's ever come out of his mouth that I agree with,"" he says. ""That looked bad. What's that expression--if people came down from Mars and saw it, what would they think? Hell, we have to do better than that."" He's leaning toward supporting Bachmann, because he wants a president who can get all sides of a debate to come together."	Michele Bachmann in Iowa: Unrepentant about her vote against raising the debt ceiling.
19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/08/superconfusion.html	"Harry Reid waited until just moments before the debt deal was approved to hand House Republicans a big surprise. ""We need to have a fair approach to this joint committee,"" he said, closing his remarks about the deal. The new ""supercommittee"" would have to demand more from ""billionaires and multimillionaires,"" and it would have to look at tax hikes as a way to avoid the ""trigger"" of automatic cuts. ""We've had too much talk these days of saying 'there will be no revenue.' That's not going to happen. Otherwise, the trigger's going to kick in."" Two minutes before the final vote, and nobody could agree what the key component of the deal actually did. Republicans had wrangled their last ""ayes"" for the plan by promising that the committee would never, ever succeed in raising taxes. They reiterated as much after Reid's speech, with House Majority Leader Eric Cantor flitting from interview to interview, promising that taxes were supercommittee kryptonite. There were ""structural scoring impediments to imposing tax increases,"" explained Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chairman of the House budget committee. Republicans interpret Ryan's word like tablets brought down from Mount Sinai, so that calmed them a bit. It shouldn't have. Ryan is right about the politics--more about that later--but misleading about the standards. There is no real restriction on the supercommittee (and we'll have to stop calling it that after its co-chairs are chosen--or after writers run out of Clark Kent jokes) that stops it from raising taxes. There are already ideas out there, CBO-scored and otherwise, that could--emphasis on could--find their ways into the committee's plan. And whatever makes it into that plan gets a glide path through the House and Senate, with no opportunities for anti-tax Republicans or pledged-to-defend-Medicare Democrats to offer amendments. So what was Ryan talking about? The committee has been ordered to offer a plan that cuts the deficit by $1.5 trillion over 10 years, based on the ""2011 baseline"" and based on ""existing law."" Those terms are worth around $3.5 trillion. Why? They refer to the Bush tax cuts that are now scheduled to expire at the crack of midnight on Jan. 1, 2013. Letting those tax cuts expire and doing nothing else gets you far closer to closing the deficit. The new committee has to assume that, then find an additional $1.5 trillion in savings. But Congress isn't assuming that. Republicans (like Ryan) may write budget plans by assuming the Bush tax cuts will expire, but it's not the policy they prefer. ""They view anything higher than permanent present law as a tax hike,"" explained Ryan Ellis, tax policy director for Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform. ""At the end of the day, that's the standard."" That's true; that's why Democrats got so much false hope on that magical morning when Norquist seemed to be open to letting the rates expire, thus liberating hundreds of Republicans from their anti-tax pledge. Don't get too annoyed with Norquist. Many Democrats, Barack Obama among them, don't simply want the Bush tax cuts to expire. Obama campaigned on keeping the rates for people making less than $250,000. Rep. Kathy Hochul, the Democrat who won this spring's special election in New York, floated the idea of keeping the rates for people making under $500,000. These are all reasons why debt-deal negotiators decided to throw up their hands, create a new committee, and douse it with gamma rays. Congress can't get anything done. Negotiators can't get anything done. Don't even ask if you can push this stuff through the relevant committees. But tax reformers are dizzy optimists. They see a situation where the Bush tax cuts can't be gimmicked any further; they see an opening. As the debt deal was being hammered out, I listened to Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., pitch their tax-reform plan to the Ripon Society, a group of moderate Republicans. They'd just grappled with the bad news that there would be no ""grand bargain"" to make tax reform move faster. Republicans just couldn't get out of the no-tax-hikes-ever foxhole. ""If you look at tax reform in the last three weeks, we were almost at the top of the roller coaster,"" Wyden groused. ""There was a period where tax reform made it into the grand bargain [between] President Obama and Speaker Boehner, then it made it into the majority leaders' plan. The Gang of Six included it in their proposal. So it was almost at the top of the mountain--only after about 72 hours, they said, we're for it, but maybe another time."" Coming soon: another time. If the supercommittee can take on taxes at all, as Democrats want it to, it will have to find something that raises more revenue than the lapsing Bush tax cuts. The Wyden-Coats plan is a start--it raises just as much revenue, although the math gets harder at the end of the decade. It collapses the number of tax brackets from six to three--15, 25, and 35 percent--and lowers the corporate income tax. If people don't like that, they have the Gang of Six framework to go on--not scored, less detailed, but something at least half the Senate likes to talk about. There are limits, but this is what a lot of members want to use the bludgeoning power of the supercommittee for. ""They're going to be restrained on what they can do with tax reform,"" admitted Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., in a short conversation this week. ""The baselines are going to make it very difficult to do. Frankly, the committees are going to be suggesting items to them."" The goal, Conrad explained, is to change the conversation to something everyone wants to do but can't get through the regular process. Get some of it over to the House and Senate. All of a sudden, you're on the rollercoaster again. ""My view has always been that that part of the reform couldn't be done until the end of next year,"" he said. ""This special committee could set the parameters for tax reform--how much needs to be raised, how you're going to do it, what's the strategy for doing it, broadening the base, even reducing rates, safeguarding progressivity so that it isn't adversely effected. The special committee can set all of those parameters."" And it can. Reid was right. That gets us to the reason that Ryan, too, was partly right. Making the numbers for tax reform work is tough but possible. Getting Republicans to agree to it is tougher, and maybe impossible. One reason the Grand Bargain fell apart was that Republican negotiators refused to budge on taxes. The reason the triggers don't include any taxes? A-ha! You guessed it. Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, talks up tax reform as much as Conrad does. But even he's cool to the idea of using it to raise more money. ""Eventually [tax reform is] going to have to go through committee process, with amendments,"" he said. ""I don't think you want tax reform to be viewed as debt reduction. You want it to be viewed as reform."" Remember how we got to this point, and how we set up the fight we're going to have in the fall. Reid punted. So did Mitch McConnell. So did everyone else. Instead of trying to reform taxes and entitlements now, they decided that Congress could only do that if it was threatened with something worse--the triggers. Automatic defense cuts! Automatic cuts to Medicare providers! What could be worse? Well, if you're a House Republican, progressive tax reform might be worse. If you're a Democrat, entitlement reform might be worse. While Reid, Cantor, and everyone else try to spin the negotiations, the thing to watch is whether a Republican who's open to revenue-raising makes it onto the committee. If a Gang of Sixer, or Dan Coats, or Rob Portman makes it on to the committee, then there's a chance that Reid will be right. If not, we know what'll hobble this project, and we already know how it will end."	Can the debt-deal supercommittee raise taxes?
20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/08/blackmail_it_works.html	"It ended with scenes straight from a Nora Ephron movie, or one of those weaker West Wing episodes with Kristin Chenoweth as the way-too-competent consultant. Gabrielle Giffords returned to the House to cast her first vote since surviving a bullet to the brain. The House and Senate passed a debt-limit deal that got the votes of Nancy Pelosi and John Boehner, Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell. The crisis concluded with a Rose Garden speech, as if someone had just won a war. All of that obscured the truth about the debt crisis. The truth: It was completely insane. It was, as Democrats say, largely unprecedented and mostly unnecessary. It was, as Republicans say, fogged up with hype that made the politics and market moves uglier than they needed to be. The inevitable tick-tocks of the deal and the slide shows of winners and losers obscure the fact that Washington just blew two months negotiating a 10-year budget cut right before it was about to knuckle down and ... negotiate the 2012 budget. In the final hours before the votes--269-161 in the House, 74-26 in the Senate--no one sounded completely happy. House Republican leaders appeared the most pleased. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who will have to fight again on the budget in September, crowed that he'd gotten two-thirds of the cuts that he'd wanted over 10 years. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, a constitutional scholar whose single-mindedness turned him into one of the stars of the crisis, predicted that the debt limit would never again be raised without a debate over spending cuts. Democrats were conceding all this. They just didn't like it. ""Democrats will use this on a Republican president,"" sighed Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., right before voting ""no"" on the deal on Monday. ""You can take it to the bank. I remember a moment in the Clinton impeachment when they were interviewing [then-Rep.] Elizabeth Holtzman about the special counsel's office. She said it was never intended to be used the way Ken Starr was using it. Well, that's what happens here. Down the road, I'm sure the Democratic caucus will embrace it. And it'll make for a tone that is angrier and uglier. And then people will say, 'Oh, that wasn't what we intended!' "" Why didn't it ever occur to Democrats to use the debt-limit vote as a negotiating tactic? Partly it's that they really believed what they were saying--they never thought the debt-limit vote should be subject to politics. And if you'd paid attention to the politics of spending and debt before, nothing would have convinced you that a Sergio Leone standoff like this would pay off. At the end of 1995, the first year of Newt Gingrich's Republican revolution, the GOP threatened to vote against a debt-limit hike unless they got policy concessions. Gingrich argued that the Treasury ""has the authority to avoid default."" Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said that he couldn't make that work. Republicans rapidly lost the P.R. battle over the debt limit, especially when Moody's issued a potential downgrade threat. They conceded: The debt limit could be increased, with provisions for a child tax credit and presidential vetoes for budget line items. That was the precedent, but it wasn't revisited for years. In the Bush era, Republicans once deemed the debt-limit hike as ""passed"" in another funding bill. In February 2009, Democrats simply added an $800 billion hike in the debt limit--from $11.3 trillion to $12.1 trillion--to the stimulus bill. There was a consensus: Play with the debt limit and you lose. That was true until July 2011, when Republicans played with the debt limit and won. ""I think we handled it better than in 1995,"" said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., after voting ""aye"" on the deal today. ""The dynamics of the electorate changed. The last election had a lot to do with spending and the economy. I'm not saying things were great in 1995, but the debt wasn't as large. Unemployment wasn't as high."" That in itself didn't guarantee that Republicans would prevail. High unemployment wasn't a symptom of the high deficit, and budget cuts weren't going to be a cure for it. But Republicans had two advantages that they lacked in 1995. They had a media landscape that had tilted in their direction, something that allowed everything from credulous interviews about their ideas to loud amplification of what conservatives wanted. When MoveOn opposed the final version of the deal, it made only a fraction as much noise as the Club for Growth made, or Tea Party Patriots made, with announcements about their stances. When Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., ingenuously drafted a bill to require the Treasury secretary to pay off debt obligations if the government ran dry on funds, he got to roll it out with a Wall Street Journal op-ed and talk it up all over talk radio and cable news. The senator whose ideas were called ""unworkable"" by the Treasury secretary got to rebut that with guest-host spots on CNBC's Squawk Box. About that Treasury secretary. When the Democrats of 1995 wanted to portray the GOP's debt-limit stance as completely insane, they had Robert Rubin backing them up. Forget what you think of Rubin now; at the time, the public trusted him. When the Democrats of 2011 wanted to rebut Republicans, they had the word of Timothy Geithner, which the public didn't put much stock in. According to CNN polling, at any given time, only around one in four Americans have a favorable opinion of Geithner. There was more to the Democrats' strategy than just sending out Geithner as a salesman. They were always fighting uphill, because Americans didn't really want to raise something called a ""debt limit."" (Even in today's postwar CNN poll, a slight majority of voters don't want to raise the ceiling--a tumble down from an older, larger majority, but still.) They had an argument to make about the necessity of tax hikes in the deal. That argument was hobbled because of their initial stance--if they wanted a ""clean"" debt limit, why pivot to a ""balanced"" deal that wasn't clean? On May 31, Republicans brought up a ""clean"" debt-limit increase, just to make a point. It failed by a vote of 318 to 97, with every single Republican putting the hammer down and voting ""no."" The argument didn't start by pointing out the role tax cuts played in nudging us closer to the ceiling, even under President Barack Obama (in the stimulus, in the tax deal). And now it doesn't really matter. Republicans not only got a deal, they got Moody's and other raters to expect one. The raters went from favoring a clean deal to demanding one with deep cuts; they did this, they said, because it seemed like the Republicans were making such a deal possible. * ""I think we are going to have spending cuts with every increase in the debt limit,"" said McCain. It was just what Democrats were saying. Somebody keep an eye out, because this hostage is going to get taken again. Correction,  Aug. 3, 2011: This article originally mischaracterized how the demands of Moody's raters on Washington policymakers changed during the debt debate."

21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/07/dont_worry_it_gets_worse.html	"The first version of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's compromise debt plan died an expected and ignoble death Saturday afternoon. The poor thing never had a chance. Before the Senate even voted on it, and instead of waiting for the bill to be sweetened with the sort of items that Republicans could support, the House GOP teed up a vote and defeated it easily--246 to 173. Members of both parties, resigned to failure, spent the House debate prepping their next sets of talking points. Republicans warned that Reid's plan, which raised the debt limit by $2.4 trillion with just that much in spending cuts, would throttle military spending. Democrats warned that Boehner's plan would ""cut Medicare and Social Security."" And every time they said that, the other side of the chamber echoed with groans and sighs. ""Both the Boehner and Reid plans have nearly identical--identical!--plans to establish joint select committees,"" said Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., the chairman of the rules committee, who spent the week shoving version after version of Boehner's plan through. Democrats revolted at that, heckling and booing Dreier. ""I thank my friends for maintaining order,"" Dreier snapped. If America actually solves this crisis, and the debt limit is increased by some mash-up of the Boehner and Reid plans, that little spat is a preview of the screams to come. Dreier was right: Democrats wanted to create a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, a 12-member, bipartisan body that would recommend new cuts or revenue streams to Congress. But Democrats were right, too: Under their plan, cuts to Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid are less likely than in the Republican plan. If you're enjoying this crisis, as they used to say on late-night TV, stay tuned. An even bigger fight will come when real cuts to the most popular social programs are part of the deal to raise the debt limit. Here's the dividing line. Both the Boehner and Reid plans create a powerful committee. (Whichever aide gave it the catchy, horrifying name of ""Super Congress"" deserves the Marvel No-Prize this month.) Under each plan, the committee gets going in a hurry, conducting its business in public, sending its first recommendations out in October and putting up its recommendations for votes by December. If at least seven members of the committee approve a plan, it gets up-or-down House and Senate votes with no amendments. There's a key difference between the plans. Under the Boehner bill, the debt limit will be raised in a way that will let the government pay bills for around six months. There just has to be a vote on the deficit committee's recommendations before the debt limit is hiked again. Under the Reid bill, there's a $2.4 trillion debt-limit hike right away; the deficit committee's plan will be voted on separately. ""We're saying raise the debt ceiling for 18 months,"" said Rep. Rob Andrews, D-N.J. ""During those 18 months we can have an extended debate over how we cut the deficit. We either will or we won't."" That's just not good enough for Republicans. Look at the last few long-term deficit-reduction plans, they say, and you see how hard it is for Washington to choke them down. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., put out a budget plan that turned Medicare into a voucher--sorry, ""premium support""--plan. Democrats whittled that into a club and won a special election in western New York with it. That plan didn't even touch Social Security. The Bowles-Simpson plan did, and it died quickly, to live on as a spectral presence in Tom Friedman and David Brooks columns. A-ha: What if you tie the entitlement cuts to another debt-limit increase? ""The only way we can get the level of cuts we need is that to cut entitlements, or slow the increase in spending for entitlements,"" explained Rep. Bill Cassidy, R-La. ""There's just not enough time to get an entitlement plan. We have one. It's the Ryan budget. But Democrats wouldn't take it up. So under this plan, the first tranche of the debt limit takes us to February, and then we get to the commission. It's not to mess up the president. It's to get the cuts."" Democrats would love to avoid this. They thought they had. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had called the debt crisis the best chance in ages for entitlement cuts, but it hadn't happened. As far as Democrats knew, if ""grand bargain"" negotiations succeeded, the debt deal would have meant raising the age of Medicare eligibility from 65 to 67. But now the most likely legislative solution to the crisis involves another hostage negotiation in 2012. Even moderate Republicans support it. ""You've got to make sure [the vote on the committee recommendations] happens,"" said Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, in a short hallway conversation. She's one of the only Republicans who hasn't ruled out a vote on the Reid plan, but she wants this trigger. ""In the Reid plan, there are no assurances--there's no specificity of what the cuts are, no guarantee they occur. In the Boehner plan, there is a guarantee. I would have preferred something different, but that's where we are."" Democrats want to stop this. There's one argument against it that they're really comfortable making: Multiple debt-limit votes will create more uncertainty. Who wants to go through this crisis again? The answer: Republicans. ""Going through this experience means we'll probably be better at it the next time,"" said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., dismissing the idea that markets will panic at another multi-stage debt showdown. ""I think my Democratic friends are afraid of that because they're going to lose the first stage and they're going to lose the second."""

22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/07/empowerment_outage.html	"If Rep. Peter King was concerned that his pet issue, Muslim radicalization, was in danger of being overshadowed by the debt crisis, he had a strategy: attack the New York Times.  At Wednesday's Homeland Security Committee hearings on the Somali terrorist group al-Shabaab, King called out the ""vacuous ideologues at the New York Times""--an apparent reference to a Roger Cohen op-ed suggesting in the wake of the Norway attacks that anti-Muslim demagogues, including King, pose a threat of their own. ""Let me make this clear to the New York Times and their acolytes in the politically correct, moral-equivalency media: I will not back down from holding these hearings,"" he said. Of course, getting headlines isn't the same as addressing the issue. If King's goal was to find real solutions to a real problem, his volley at the Times was a distraction. But, given how little of Wednesday's three-hour hearing was devoted to proposals for curbing al-Shabaab recruitment, it's worth asking whether that was really King's goal. As it turns out, it wasn't. Sure, eventually the federal government will need to look at what it can actually do about the problem, King said. But for now, his aims are more modest: raise awareness about the seriousness of the threat, and empower moderate Muslims to speak out against terrorism without fear of stigma. That's right: awareness-raising and empowerment. Maybe King has more in common with the politically correct left than he lets on. So before we dismiss King's hearing as disingenuous, or as an exercise in Islamophobic pandering, let's judge it by King's own standards. Awareness-raising? In this respect, it succeeded. As with King's first radicalization hearing in March, much of the discussion on Wednesday was about the hearings themselves. King and his fellow Republicans were for them, the Democrats on the committee were against them, and the witnesses, for the most part, were pawns in the battle between the two. Unlike in March, however, this hearing addressed a problem both specific and demonstrably real enough that both sides could at least agree it was a problem. By the end, the evidence was clear that the threat was real, and the few Democrats who tried to downplay it came across as having their heads in the sand. Al-Shabaab has in the past four years successfully lured a few dozen Somali-American (and Somali-Canadian--more on that below) young men to leave their homes and fly to Africa to join their murderous insurgency. Most have come from the Minneapolis area, whose Somali population is the nation's largest. One, a 27-year-old named Shirwa Ahmed, became the first known American suicide bomber when he blew himself up in Northern Somalia in 2008. The worry among homeland security analysts is that al-Shabaab--or al-Qaida, with which it shares an ideology and some personnel--will use these recruits' American citizenship to help them launch an attack inside the United States. The number recruited to jihad is small, but large enough in proportion to the insular Somali-American population to be disturbing. And, as at least one witness pointed out, Somali-Americans themselves are among the people most concerned about the problem. Which leads to King's second stated goal: His hearings were supposed to encourage those anxious Muslim-Americans to stand up and voice their concerns. One problem: Wednesday's hearing featured not a single Muslim-American. Yes, there was a Muslim-Canadian testifying that he felt empowered: Ahmed Hussen, a member of Canada's Cross-Cultural Roundtable on Security, spoke intelligently about the cultural and economic challenges that confront Somali refugees in both countries. But if King's hearings are having such salutary effects on Somali-Americans, was a man with ""strong links to the American Somali community"" really the best he could do? King's explanation, when I asked him about it after the hearing, was that conscientious Somali-Americans are still too intimidated to speak out. But if that's true, some of the blame must fall on King himself. At his first hearing in March, he nodded as a Somali-American named Abdirizak Bihi spoke passionately about his concern that mosque leaders weren't sufficiently cooperative with authorities. But as soon as Bihi began to discuss the root causes of discontent among young Somali-Americans--broken families, lack of economic opportunity--King cut him off. King displayed the same distaste for substantive analysis this time around. Luckily, a few of his counterparts on the committee, both Republican and Democrat, appeared interested in actually learning something. Rep. Dan Lungren, a Republican from California, quizzed both Hussen and Tom Smith, police chief of St. Paul, Minn. Smith's department has developed a series of programs to build trust in the local Somali community, including school-study programs, open gyms, and even camping trips for the youngsters. These types of touchy-feely initiatives can't solve the problem entirely, of course. But they're more concrete than King's ""empowerment"" strategy. Then again, such programs cost money--something the government is trying quite hard to conserve these days. So perhaps the hearing will end up being overshadowed by the debt problem after all."

24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/07/the_crash_that_didnt_happen.html	"The world didn't end Sunday. That was good news for everyone who isn't currently leading a rapture-ready cult, and it was especially good news for Republicans in Congress. They'd said for weeks that the July 22 debt-limit deadline floated by the White House was meaningless, and they'd been warned that when Asian markets opened on Sunday night local time, they'd careen out of control. That didn't happen. The initial declines were modest--0.63 percent in Tokyo and Hong Kong, 0.73 percent in Shanghai. When American stock exchanges opened, the declines in the S&P and Dow Jones were similarly modest. The price of gold rose, but not by too much. Republicans exhaled. They emerged from Monday afternoon's crucial caucus meeting, where they were sold on the latest, newest version of a debt deal, with cool heads. ""I was just checking the markets,"" said Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., pointing to his trusty iPad. (It's the first-generation model. He's a conservative.) ""We're down 63 today, which could be a factor of anything. I think it's encouraging that the markets aren't overreacting."" Had the markets tumbled, the GOP might have found itself repeating September 2008, panicking and taking blame when the markets expected TARP to pass, and it failed. ""It is operationally very different than the last debacle,"" said McHenry. At least we can agree that it's a debacle. The House and Senate returned from the weekend in order to be sold on two competing plans, which had been hinted at on Sunday in order to calm investors. The newest Democratic plan came from Harry Reid, who elucidated $2.7 trillion in cuts over 10 years in order to pass a $2.4 trillion debt-limit hike. The newest Republican plan, sold to his caucus by Boehner, would raise the limit by just as much, in two stages, with immediate cuts and an eventual vote on a balanced-budget amendment. Boehner had the harder sell, and the relative calm in the markets was a big reason. At every step of the debt-limit fight, Republicans--especially House Republicans--have doubted the wisdom of the experts. They don't trust Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. They don't trust the bond-rating agencies. They certainly don't trust President Obama. The fact that there wasn't a sell-off over the weekend, and that the cities were not overrun with bikers stealing peoples' gold fillings, was proof that they were right. ""Those of us who were actually paying attention to the issue didn't expect it be apocalyptic,"" said Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C. ""To think that how we're going to vote today is going to affect markets, I think, is absurd. We're not going to default. We're going to pay our debts. Certainly, Mr. Geithner could come out and assure everyone if he wanted to. He could do that tonight. My guess is he probably wants a little instability in the markets, so he can get some leverage in this negotiation."" That was the mindset that House Speaker John Boehner confronted as he sold his plan. And for the most part, he won over the skeptics. Sure, there were exceptions. Conservative activists--backers of the ""Cut, Cap, and Balance"" plan that has as much chance of passing the Senate as a law mandating abortions--released a statement attacking Boehner's plan even before the caucus meeting was over. As they left the meeting room, some members talked to reporters. Some of them gritted their teeth. Rep. Jean Schmidt, R-Ohio, literally waved off interview requests, flicking her wrist. Rep. Rodney Alexander, R-La., responded to one request with a dismissive, low-register mumble. But according to others who were in the room, the plan went over well. Most members held off on supporting the plan until the details would be released, later tonight. The details they did get seemed to max out the GOP's current leverage with the sort of long-term cuts Rep. Paul Ryan's budget had called for. There would be caps on future spending, something a few Democrats in the Senate already supported. The debt-limit increase would be automatic--insulating members somewhat from a tough vote--and would only last through February. The next rounds of cuts were contingent on the creation of a 12-member joint congressional committee (something derisively referred to elsewhere as the ""Super Congress"") that would be charged with coming up with a deficit plan that Congress could only vote up or down, not amend. The Boehner plan would make it easier to cut spending than anything Republicans could have gotten without the pressure of the debt limit. The Reid plan, introduced at the very same time, had spending cuts of about the size that conservatives wanted, and no tax increases. So much for the White House's leverage, and so much for Geithner's threats.  When I told Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., that Sen. Charles Schumer * was selling the plan as something the House Republicans ""can't refuse,"" he scoffed. If the Boehner plan passes the House, Duffy said, ""it's a deal they can't refuse."" (Like other freshmen, he reserved his full support for the plan until he saw its language tonight.) ""Do we have any belief that they can pass anything out of the Senate? If something gets done, it'll be on our side."" Republicans were getting closer and closer to the ""something."" For now, all they needed to do was get behind Boehner. ""We'd be undercutting ourselves not to give him the votes he needs for the negotiations,"" said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla. If they do that and Congress defines the terms of the deal, they get a Democratic president to agree to some package of spending cuts, and some sort of commission that could cut entitlements, right at the start of his re-election campaign. The president seemed to fear what would happen if he walked away from a deal. They didn't. Just look at the markets. Correction,  July 25, 2011: The article originally attributed this quote to Sen. Harry Reid. In fact, it was Sen. Charles Schumer who said the plan was something House Republicans ""can't refuse."" (Return to the corrected sentence.)"

25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/07/these_three_kingmakers.html	"There are plenty of reasons why the Republican Party has dug in so deep, with so many demands, on the debt limit. It's what its new members of Congress want. It's what their presidential candidates, largely following their lead, want. And it's what Jim DeMint wants. DeMint's wishes matter because, besides being the de facto leader of the Tea Party in the Senate, he has established himself as a kingmaker in South Carolina, one of the three early-primary states a Republican presidential candidate needs to win. In New Hampshire, the kingmaker is the businessman and failed statewide candidate Ovide Lamontagne. In Iowa, it's the Iowa FAMiLY Leader's CEO (and failed statewide candidate) Bob Vander Plaats. Of the three, Vander Plaats is the only one trying to hold GOP candidates to a pledge on social issues--and he is having the toughest time getting candidates to follow his lead. For a decade, Vander Plaats has established himself as the Iowa social conservative who has to be dealt with. In his second run for governor, he dropped out of the race only to become his rival's running mate. When that didn't work, he chaired Mike Huckabee's campaign in the state, and basked in the credit when Huckabee won the caucuses. Like DeMint, he created leverage, used it, and got more of it. He invites candidates to FAMiLY Leader forums, and they show up. He can bestow forgiveness or credibility on the candidates who ask for it. Newt Gingrich may take fire for his three marriages, but when he donates to the 2010 campaign to defeat Iowa judges who supported gay unions, or he talks with Vander Plaats, he gets forgiveness. ""Here's the deal,"" Vander Plaats says. ""We're a Christian organization, which means a cornerstone of our faith is forgiveness and redemption. We're very clear that we're not trying to beat up people for their past. We've all fallen short, we can all move forward. And Newt Gingrich is very open about his shortcomings. He's shown a degree of maturity and humility."" Vander Plaats doesn't rule out contact with a presidential campaign unless they rule it out first. (He's utterly dismissive of Gary Johnson and Jon Huntsman: ""They're going to run from the debate,"" he shrugs.) But he's running into trouble as he tries to pin the candidates down. At the start of July he unveiled ""The Marriage Vow: A Declaration of Dependence Upon Marriage and Family."" It was a long, footnoted document giving candidates the chance to defend the sacred institution and get in with Vander Plaats. It backfired. The full version of the vow, which only Michele Bachmann and Rick Santorum signed, included a preamble condemnation of pornography and a line about how ""slavery had a disastrous impact on African-American families, yet sadly a child born into slavery in 1860 was more likely to be raised by his mother and father in a two-parent household"" than a baby born in the Obama era. The rest of the candidates rejected the vow. Bachmann, when asked, rejected the slavery portion of it. The GOP's speaker pro tem in the House started saying what was obvious: Vander Plaats had lost clout. ""I'd say to the candidates that if they have their own statements we very much want to take a look at those,"" he says. ""But we believe, at the crux of this, that this is a time when people are looking for bold leaders. There's no doubt that the pledge is demanding bold leadership. The preamble is pretty much just supporting data that family is in crisis. The slavery portion was being intentionally misinterpreted in the press."" Sure, there were less incendiary ways to write the pledge. But the essential problem is that it was harder for a Republican kingmaker to bring candidates to his position on social issues than it is to get them right on economics. This is Lamontagne's view, as he makes fewer demands on the Republicans who try to get right with him before they run. ""A pledge like that takes them off message,"" he says, referring to the FAMiLY Leader pledge. ""It takes them off what they should be talking about. I'm pleased there doesn't seem to be that sort of pressure in New Hampshire. Most of us look for the total package when we look for a candidate. There's no reason to rely on some pledge, some fringe issue, that will decide your vote."" Yet DeMint has figured out how to take a pledge, back it up with the force of a key primary-state endorsement (or nonendorsement), and redefine what it means to be a faithful Republican. Two months ago, when Republicans came to South Carolina for the first presidential debate, he walked through the spin room delivering an ultimatum: No candidate would get his support unless he or she also supported a balanced budget amendment. Weeks later, he teamed up with conservative groups and endorsed an official ""Cut, Cap, and Balance"" pledge, tying any increase in the debt limit to a two-thirds vote in Congress that would send an amendment to the states. He got every presidential candidate except Jon Huntsman to sign it. Eventually, everyone else caught up to him. The cut-cap-balance bill died in the Senate on Friday. That's OK: No one's really figured out yet the limits that the party will go to on taxes and spending cuts. DeMint's trying to force the issue. He's getting every potential Republican president to say that this is the plan. If they don't say it, they can't play in South Carolina, and they can't win over the base. He creates the standard. Candidates live up to it, or perish. ""I think what the 'Cut, Cap, and Balance' pledge shows is the difference between the accountability of a candidate and the accountability of an incumbent,"" says DeMint. ""It's a cleansing process that goes on when you're campaigning."" It's a new experience for him. In 2007, as a freshman senator, he endorsed Mitt Romney early in the process--citing, among other things, Romney's solution for health care coverage. He's regretted that ever since. ""I've been encouraging everyone not to endorse early,"" he says. ""Once you endorse, the candidates stop listening to you. They pay attention to somebody else."" That's not a problem for DeMint in 2011."	Jim DeMint, Bob Vander Plaats, Ovide Lamontagne: The three most important people in the Republican Party.
26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/07/peas_in_our_time.html	"The House of Representatives was halfway through the debate on the ""Cut, Cap, and Balance Act"" when Democratic contempt finally bubbled over. The microphone went to Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., a former judge whose past and present legal problems are so complicated that he's usually just referred to as ""colorful."" ""Do you genuinely believe this measure is going to become law?"" asked Hastings. ""I genuinely hope it does,"" said Rep. Jason Chaffetz, its sponsor. As he ticked off its benefits--spending caps, freezes, a balanced budget enshrined in the Constitution-- Hastings interrupted him. ""I bet you cash money that it ain't gonna become the law,"" Hastings said. As Chaffetz started to joke about his discomfort with cash bets, a bored Hastings simply left the chamber. Thirteen days before the U.S. Treasury says it will be unable to pay its bills, House Republicans were debating--and debating, and debating--a plan that could never pass the Senate. Meanwhile, senators were talking up an alternative debt plan, one that had been cooked up over six months by three Democrats and three Republicans. To varying degrees, all the senators were worried about the same question: What were they supposed to do about the House? On Tuesday, the two chambers felt impossibly far apart. The events in either house might as well have been happening in different screenplays. The Senate's morning began when Tom Coburn, the conservative who'd left the alternate-budget-drafting Gang of Six, made a triumphant return. He signed back up with the Gang and briefed 50 senators on what they'd come up with. Senators leaving the meeting sounded like pilgrims returning from Lourdes. ""We went from a gang of six to a mob of 60!"" beamed Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W. Va. The president all but endorsed the plan thereafter. It was difficult to find senators who weren't optimistic. What was in the plan? It was hard to say. The Gang would cut $3.7 trillion over the long term by reforming entitlements and slashing discretionary spending. What sort of slashing could we look forward to? That would be left largely up to committees. The Gang would end the alternative minimum tax and flatten the tax code--fewer breaks, lower rates, but with the goal of increasing revenue. Senators loved it. ""This is an achievement of statesmanship,"" Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said. ""We ought to declare victory, get it ready to vote on, and try to form some sort of supermajority critical mass and save the day."" The Gang's plan looked like it bumped up against another Republican plan. For weeks, Republicans in both houses had been coalescing around the ""Cut, Cap, and Balance"" bill. When they put their names on it, they'd pledged not to raise the debt ceiling without those specific cuts and caps, and without the passage of a balanced budget amendment. I asked Sen. Lamar Alexander, who's both in the Republican leadership and a co-sponsor of the ""Cut, Cap and Balance"" bill, how he could support the Gang's plan, too. ""Look, I'm going to support any serious proposal that has a real chance of stopping Washington from spending money we don't have,"" he explained. ""I'm a co-sponsor of the balanced budget amendment. I'm a co-sponsor of Cut, Cap, and Balance. I support the Gang of Six proposal. I'm a co-sponsor of Sen. Bob Corker's spending cap. In the Senate, you need 60 votes to get anything accomplished, and here you have six senators who've worked for six months and come up with a recommendation."" So it was settled--except that it wasn't. In the House, the parade of freshman Republicans continued, sparring with a league of bored Democrats and playing a game of How Many Talking Points Can I Stuff Inside This Sentence? The Democratic winner of that game might have been Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., who opened with this line: ""This is an ideologically extreme measure that will end Medicare as we know it, and will preserve tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans."" On the Republican side, some members realized that they could distinguish themselves if they captured their arguments in the form of colorful charts. The semi-official ""Cut, Cap, Balance"" logo was a pie chart with each of those three words occupying a slice of the pie. Rep. Jack Kingston showed his peers the chart, then flipped it around to reveal a blank white space. ""Here's the president's plan!"" said Kingston. He grabbed a pen, scrawled the word ""speeches,"" and drew a final squiggly flourish underneath it. Not long after that, Rep. Bill Flores, R-Tex., tried to outdo him with a horrifying bizarro version of the CCB logo--all red, with pie pieces describing the Obama plan as ""tax, spend, regulate."" Yet on Tuesday, it looked like Obama would endorse a realistic plan, the Gang's plan, while the GOP's conservatives passed their symbolic plan. It's frustrating for the Tea Party caucus. They've shifted the conversation--a Democratic president is going to have to agree to spending cuts in the year before an election--but again and again, they've found themselves in the position of making bold speeches, getting ignored, and having to vote on something that was agreed upon by a few people in some other room. It happened with the ""repeal"" of health care reform. It happened with the continuing resolution. Every time, there's more bad faith, and a better-organized push in the House, but winning arguments and actually winning aren't the same thing. As Republican senators girded for the deal, they tested out the arguments they'd make to their House colleagues. ""You have to decide who you have confidence in,"" said Wicker. ""I have confidence in Douglas Holtz-Eakin. I have confidence in people who've worked shoulder to shoulder with us for decades, like Larry Kudlow. They say that it's not worth risking [default on] Aug. 3. You have to ask yourself: Have Tom Coburn and Mike Crapo and Saxby Chambliss sold us out?"" What about those Republicans who are pledging not to raise the debt limit at all? ""The people who said they'd vote against raising the debt ceiling took themselves out of the debate."""

There are seven of us sitting around Diaz, listening and nodding.

This  get-together, in a Quaker meeting house in Washington's Dupont Circle, started at 4 p.m. on Saturday and went on for two hours. It was one of about 1,600 * such parties happening around the country last weekend, and one of 10 within a short bike or car ride from my house. ""I came here to D.C. when Nixon was bustin' into the Watergate,"" said Diaz. ""We had Reagan after that. We've had 30 years of Reaganomics and corporate greed. And we're here in part because when Obama ran for president and got elected and all that, we thought were going to see a break. We were going to turn a page. We were going to break these 30 years of Reaganonomics. But we went to sleep. The Tea Party won the elections. We made a bad mistake."" Diaz has asked the question plaguing liberals since February 2009, when the first impromptu, blog-organized protests against the stimulus plan broke out in Seattle and Tampa. What the hell happened to liberal protests? How could the same mall that filled front to back for Barack Obama's inauguration be conquered nine months later by Tea Party activists? Why were members of Congress shouted down at town halls when they talked about health care, when every liberal could Google polls that proved the public option was popular? Liberals can come up with two answers. They can say that their movement sputtered because Obama didn't govern from the left, didn't nail Wall Street, and proved every Republican argument right by conceding it. Or they can blame themselves for electing Obama, buying the commemorative Shepard Fairey ""Yes We Did"" poster, and then sitting back and laughing as the Tea Party out-organized them. I didn't poll the crowd, but I guessed they bought that second story. The Republican comeback was their fault. This is the sense I got before the event began. One hundred thirty-five people had RSVPed online, and about half of them showed up. The crowd skewed older and more skeptical. They've been to a lot of meetings co-organized by MoveOn.org. They've listened to a lot of this'll-fix-everything plans. Jabari Zakiya into the room with a T-shirt and bag sporting the FAIR Tax logo, and to anyone who'll listen, explained how abolishing the income tax (""It's not constitutional"") is the only sure way of eliminating gross corporate power. The meeting started on a slow note. Our leader, Jeff Hops, cautioned that he was reading from a script provided by MoveOn, so if things got overly structured or chart-based, that was why. Then he played an audio message from Van Jones and the other national organizers. ""There's no sound system in the meeting house,"" he said. The assembled approached the speakers of a Toshiba laptop. ""We're all fighters,"" said the disembodied voice of Van Jones. ""People have been fighting back all across the country, against these awful cutbacks, the idea that we should be throwing our public employees and teachers under the bus, the idea that we should be throwing Medicare under the bus. ... Seventy percent of Americans agree that we should be raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans. We should be prioritizing jobs, jobs, jobs."" And so we did. The first order of business was sharing our sob stories. The people in their 20s and 30s talked about all of their underemployed friends. The people in their 60s talked about how the left used to be good at this stuff. Then it was time for the main event: the Contract for the American Dream. This whole effort is a reverse-engineering job on the Tea Party. Yet the contract is something that the right took from the old, pamphleteering left. This version is designed for maximum efficiency--the most popular items selected at the American Dream parties will be sent to MoveOn, which will start cranking out a manifesto. On four sheets of paper, there are 40 line items for a progressive agenda--""create [health] care jobs,"" ""end the huge waste of wars and invest the money in peace-building,"" and so on. We were told to select three priorities. The airing of grievances was over, and we had moved on to talking strategy. There are plenty of progressive dreams on this list, but what did people at the meeting think they could sell? What do they think they should sell? The group honed in on all of the economics items. The most popular item is about tax hikes."	"""Rebuild the Dream"": Can Van Jones help liberals create their own version of the Tea Party?"

Republicans want to spend that time debating a balanced budget amendment. ""Republicans will spend the next two weeks fighting for the one thing that will ensure that Washington gets its house in order,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor quickly confirmed that, announcing that Republicans would return next week to vote on, and pass, the ""Cut, Cap, and Balance"" bill, which locks in a balanced budget amendment in any deal to raise the debt limit. Was that too subtle? No worries. Rep. Jim Jordan, who leads the Republican Study Committee that originated the ""Cut, Cap, and Balance"" plan, proclaimed that the amendment had to pass ""if we are to preserve America's AAA credit rating and grow the economy."" The RSC then sent reporters the 1982 speech in which Ronald Reagan endorsed the amendment, bestowing on it the immaculate touch of Republican politics. So on Tuesday we'll start a new debate over something that had been buried with a one-vote defeat in the Senate 1997, forgotten by 1998, and remembered mostly as one of the old Contract With America items that never made it into law. The Balanced Budget Amendment wasn't even part of the GOP's 2010 Pledge to America. Why is it making a comeback now? Can it even pass? The first question answers the second. Balanced Budget Amendment 1.0 got a vote after years of debating and organizing. Version 2.0 has emerged, quick-and-dirty, as one of the most popular items in the GOP's emergency response to the debt. It polls in the 70s. But the current version is different from the 1990s version--and the difference makes passage in the Senate impossible. You can compare the two versions here. The biggest changes are an iron ceiling on spending and a supermajority requirement for tax hikes, spelled out like this:"	Balanced Budget Amendment: How you can tell it's just a political stunt.
29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/07/take_me_to_your_leader.html	"In the spirit of reducing waste, fraud and abuse in Washington, I suggest a drastic cut in the number of words used by any leader in Washington calling on any other leader in Washington to show leadership. Instead of endless vague generalities, they should just say: Give me what I want. Along with the debate over the debt ceiling, official Washington is also offering Americans a series of lectures on the subject of leadership. In their negotiations, which broke off last weekend, House Speaker John Boehner and President Obama were both showing a version of it. The two men struggled to resolve their differences--giving a little, assuming political risk, acting in good faith. One of the Washington cliches is that in tough deals, everyone has to hold hands and jump. By this standard, the two men were leading. Obama may have held Boehner's hand for longer than a handshake but shorter than a street crossing. And look at the trouble it caused him. For the last few days, Boehner has been at pains to stamp out the idea that he was ever interested in any kind of deal that would raise taxes. That's not exactly so: He was at least notionally in favor of a deal that would raise taxes on some people in exchange for lowering them for other people. Still, in a party where supporting any kind of tax increase is deadly, Boehner has had to reassert his fortitude. (In 1990, when George H.W. Bush agreed to tax increases to get a budget deal, the commitment to shared sacrifice was called ""leadership."" It also killed him with his party.) Boehner's experience points to the difficulties of leading in public: If the details get out before you've come to an agreement with your adversary, you have to jump before you've taken the other guy's hand. At the same time, ""leading in public"" is the only definition of leadership some people will allow. If a president or party leader isn't trussed up in a powder wig and crossing the Delaware, he's not leading. So Republicans are demanding that Obama put forward a specific plan on paper for all to see. Had Boehner done that when he and Obama started noodling a solution, they never would have gotten as far as they did. Obama and his advisers, meanwhile, like the strong, silent type--except when they don't. David Axelrod poked Mitt Romney for not making a flamboyant act of self-destruction by speaking up in the current debate: ""Anyone heard from Mitt Romney lately? Where is he on McConnell plan? On the debt talks? On the impact of a default? Why so quiet?"" Of course, Romney is not an elected official, and will not be required to vote on anything. Yet Romney is not living up to his campaign's usual standard, which is to let no Washington development pass without releasing a campaign video knocking Obama's leadership. To prove just how committed Boehner is against tax cuts, his office issued a press release citing a poll that says Americans want an increase in the debt limit only if it is accompanied by spending reductions and a promise to reduce the deficit. It also cites a poll that says Americans are against across-the-board tax increases. ""Republicans,"" it declares, ""are standing with the American people."" But isn't leadership doing ""what's right,"" no matter what the polls say? After all, that's what George Bush said. It's what Obama said during the debate over health-care reform (about which the polls remain lukewarm). Republicans said then that Obama was fundamentally out of step with the public. His job was to be in step. The problem with this definition of leadership is that it leads to contortions like the one in Boehner's press release. The first poll is by a GOP polling firm. In a recent poll by the generally more respected Gallup organization, only 20 percent of respondents support the GOP position of deficit reduction through spending cuts only. Among Republicans, this position wins only 26 percent support. The second poll is a nearly meaningless one from U.S. News and World Report that asks people whether they would like their taxes raised. In the current debate, that's never been a question on the table. When you ask people about a specific increase that is on the table--such as allowing rates to increase for those who make more than $250,000 a year--the public is wildly for it. It has 72 percent approval, according to a recent New York Times poll. But Boehner is against that, which, by the standard of his own press release, is not standing with the American people and therefore not leadership. Then again, in this instance, maybe Boehner is subscribing to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's view of leadership. McConnell is not anxious to join Boehner and Obama's negotiations. On Tuesday he offered a Plan B that would raise the debt limit without any deal on larger issues like spending or taxes. It offers a potential back door for negotiators who may not be able to reach an agreement before the Aug. 2 deadline for default. Now that's leadership, you might say: McConnell offended his party's most vocal constituents--Tea Party activists opposed to a ""clean"" vote on the debt ceiling alone--in order to get a deal. McConnell is willing to look cravenly political to achieve an end, in this case avoiding default. The only slight problem is that the door may be blocked. Members of the House who support the Tea Party will not countenance the McConnell plan. It may be doomed. Boehner's attempt to show leadership--negotiating with Obama--failed, in part, because his caucus wouldn't go along with him. McConnell's attempt to show leadership--not negotiating with Obama--will likely fail for the same reason. House and Senate leaders are captive to the wishes of their most ardent constituents. Is that ""leading from behind,"" as the Obama team calls it, or is that what Republicans derisively label as ""followership""? If we only had a leader to tell us. Become a fan of  John Dickerson  on Facebook."	"Debt-limit talks: What Obama, Boehner, and McConnell mean when they call for ""leadership."""
