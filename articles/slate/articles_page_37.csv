If you do not consider these truths to be self-evident, then you might be either conspiracy-pumping radio host Alex Jones, or one of the many people in this fascinating country who have become very upset over the military's decision to stage a monthslong training exercise this summer, known as Jade Helm 15, across seven states in the Southwest. The Jade Helm hysteria is a South Park episode come to life, filled with hysterical townspeople hoisting odd signs and yelling cartoonishly. But the furor shouldn't be wholly dismissed as a joke. There is something off-putting about these vast military exercises that will take place way out in the desert, not to mention the secrecy of the military division that is running them--just not in the way the conspiracy theorists think. A primer: In March, the U.S. Army Special Operations Command announced it would hold a two-month-long training exercise to give Special Forces personnel experience operating on ""unfamiliar terrain."" As part of this exercise, USASOC released a map of the Southwestern U.S. with various states, including Texas and Utah, marked as ""hostile"" territory. A reasonable person, looking at this map and knowing the context, would accept it as a document created for this alternate-reality simulation, like a Model United Nations conference with more guns. But many unreasonable people saw this map and concluded that it is how the Obama administration really feels and that the military was on its way to do ... something or other, probably involving gun confiscation, or ISIS, or Walmart, or all of them. The fury over Jade Helm 15 has grown to the point where the governor of Texas has ordered the State Guard to keep tabs on the exercise in order to guarantee Texans' safety and constitutional rights while federal officials have had to repeatedly reiterate that nothing nefarious is afoot. It's easy to mock the Jade Helmers as cranks--jowly, wind-burned conspiracy nuts who get their news from CAPS LOCK email forwards and paranoid banner ads. Like all stereotypes, there is some truth in this one, but it's also more than a little unfair. In the rush to condemn and dismiss these dumb people and score political points off their inarticulate paranoia--one blogger at Daily Kos wonders whether the conspiracy theory is ""the single stupidest thing to come out of Texas in 20 years,"" which is really saying something--some commentators are missing what seems like a fairly obvious point. My colleague Dahlia Lithwick had a very smart piece in Slate on Thursday noting the connections between the Jade Helm uproar and the recent Freddie Gray protests in Maryland, both of which are rooted in ""fears of a militarized police state, anxiety over lawless authorities, worries about privacy and personal property, a yawning gap between haves and have-nots. These grievances are fueled by what we know about police, the military, and the collapse of the line between them."" This collapse is evident to any resident of a major American city. The high-profile police shootings that have dominated America's headlines over the past year--and the often-violent standoffs between protesters and police that have ensued--certainly seem to indicate that America's order-maintenance personnel are better armed and less discreet than ever. ""It's not crazy to complain about militarization,"" wrote Jesse Walker in a good Los Angeles Times op-ed the other day, and the Jade Helmers' fears of creeping governmental authoritarianism are similar to those expressed by people on the left, albeit filtered through a very different lens. It is perfectly valid to become unnerved by a monthslong military training exercise on domestic civilian territory, both in practice and in concept--especially when it is being planned and implemented by a group that is barely even accountable to Congress, let alone the public. The Jade Helm truthers are not the first people to be frustrated by the U.S. Special Operations Command, the Department of Defense division in charge of USASOC and, ultimately, Jade Helm 15. SOCOM oversees America's Special Forces, as well as things like drones, information warfare, and other secretive tactics. The division gets a lot of money every year--it has asked for a $10.547 billion budget in fiscal year 2016--and it doesn't waste too much time bothering to explain exactly how that sum is spent. In 2013, Time reported that the House Appropriations Committee had complained that it was ""unable to conduct meaningful oversight of SOCOM's budget requirements as the current justification does not include the necessary level of detail."" Last year, the Intercept's Ryan Gallagher wrote that ""very little is known about the scope and purpose of [SOCOM operations], given the extreme secrecy that often shrouds them."" The public hysteria over Jade Helm 15, embarrassing though it may be, is nevertheless imposing a measure of accountability on a war games project that nobody else is going to evaluate. Whom does this exercise serve: the American public? Special Forces soldiers training for some current or future mission? Defense contractors peddling new weapons for wars that are increasingly being fought by remote control? SOCOM surely wasn't going to volunteer this information before the Jade Helmers began complaining, and while it still might not, there is at the very least more public attention now being paid to this organization, and that's a good thing. Finally, while this particular conspiracy theory is very stupid, most of the people scoffing at its adherents would likely admit that, under the Obama administration, federal security forces have engaged in plenty of unrighteous activity. You shouldn't trust the Pentagon to respect Americans' civil liberties. The federal government does keep secrets from its citizens, and if it finds the antics of the lunatic fringe tiresome, well, it should try being more transparent and direct in its governance, and perhaps refrain from the sorts of real-life rights violations that lend credence to the more outlandish theories. ""Whatever Jade Helm 15 actually is ..."" was how Chuck Norris began one sentence in a column on Jade Helm at WND.com. But we sort of know what Jade Helm 15 actually is. It's a drawn-out, expensive military training simulation ostensibly designed to train soldiers to fight in wars that this country should not be fighting, supervised by a marginally accountable and lavishly funded Defense Department office that can afford to dick around in the desert for two months while countless other federal programs and agencies struggle to make do with their meager allocations. Isn't that worrisome enough?"	The Jade Helm Conspiracy Theories Are Moronic, but They're Still Right About One Thing
1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/05/negotiating_with_terrorists_let_s_stop_pretending_we_don_t_and_craft_better.html	"On March 1, 1973, a group of gunmen stormed into a reception being held at the Saudi Embassy in Khartoum, Sudan, taking hostage a group of diplomats that included the U.S. ambassador and deputy chief of mission. The militants--from the Palestinian group Black September, which a year earlier had killed nine Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics--demanded the immediate release of a list of prisoners in Germany, Israel, Jordan, and the United States, including Sirhan Sirhan, the convicted assassin of Robert Kennedy. At a press conference the next day, President Nixon was asked if the U.S. government was considering Sirhan's release. ""As far as the United States as a government giving in to blackmail demands, we cannot do so and we will not do so,"" the president said. ""We will do everything that we can to get them released, but we will not pay blackmail."" Several hours later both U.S. diplomats were dead. Though it may not have seemed particularly significant at the time--it's hard to imagine any U.S. president seriously entertaining the notion of releasing Kennedy's assassin--Nixon's comment was the first articulation of what, more than 40 years later, has become a well-known policy: The U.S. won't give in to terrorist demands, even if it means that U.S. citizens will die. But over the years, and particularly since the 9/11 attacks, the stated policy--it's not a codified law--has morphed into something it was never intended to be. Not making concessions to terrorists has become, in loudly proclaimed rhetoric, not negotiating with terrorists, which has become not communicating with terrorists in any context, which has become preventing others, like the family members of American hostages, from negotiating. ""It was not originally no concession, no negotiations,"" Brian Michael Jenkins, a senior adviser at the RAND Corp. and expert on terrorism, tells me. ""There are a variety of ways to persuade someone to release hostages. But over a period of time, it became a mantra."" Last fall, in the wake of several highly publicized ISIS beheadings and the controversial prisoner exchange that secured the release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, President Obama ordered a review of U.S. hostage policy. That policy is once again back in the news thanks to the accidental killing of an American and an Italian al-Qaida prisoner in a U.S. airstrike in January. A review of--and articulation of--how the U.S. can and should deal with hostage situations is long overdue, not least because there appears to be confusion about what exactly our policy is, even among those charged with implementing it. Whatever the review concludes, it should start from the premise that the U.S. policy against paying ransoms was never meant to apply to families, and that it was never meant to preclude talking to hostage takers, which can often prove useful for buying time and gathering information in a dangerous situation. Politicians have long been saying one thing and doing another when it comes to hostage negotiations. It was Ronald Reagan, who, as a candidate, upped the ante by promising that when he became president, ""there will be no negotiation with terrorists of any kind."" But his administration infamously negotiated the sale of weapons to Iran as part of an effort to secure the release of American hostages in Lebanon. George W. Bush also boldly proclaimed, ""No nation can negotiate with terrorists, for there is no way to make peace with those whose only goal is death."" But in 2002 his White House supported arranging a ransom payment to the al-Qaida-affiliated Abu Sayyaf Group in the Philippines in an unsuccessful attempt to secure the release of two American hostages. And outside of hostage negotiations, there's a long tradition of the U.S. maintaining secret backchannels with groups considered terrorists, as well as publicly encouraging negotiation with them. Not negotiating with terrorists has always been a policy guideline--subject to amendment when circumstances demand--rather than the near-biblical commandment you'd think it was from the statements of prominent Republicans. ""U.S. policy has changed. Now we make deals with terrorists,"" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said after the Bergdahl swap. ""It has long been America's unwavering, bipartisan policy not to negotiate with terrorists, especially for the exchange of hostages,"" said former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton. ""By trading to release hostages, we are invariably putting a price on the heads of other Americans,"" said Sen. Marco Rubio. While Republicans have been definitive, if wrong, on U.S. policy, the Obama administration has seemed confused. Then-Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, for instance, argued that the swap of Taliban detainees for Bergdahl did not violate the policy because it had been handled through Qatari mediators. But Hagel's explanation got the logic of the policy backward, seeming to argue that concessions to terrorists are fine so long as the U.S. doesn't directly communicate with them. (The better answer would have been that the U.S., which was then in the process of winding down combat operations in Afghanistan, has a long history of trading hostages with the enemy at the end of wars.) The administration's policy appeared even more incoherent after the beheading of U.S. journalist James Foley at the hands of ISIS in August 2014, after which his parents reported that they had been threatened with prosecution by government officials if they attempted to raise money to pay their son's ransom. Early reports indicate that the review of hostage policy ordered by Obama--being conducted by National Counterterrorism Center, due to release its findings later this spring--will recommend allowing families to pay ransoms to hostage takers. But this would actually just be a restatement of long-standing U.S. policy. Gary Noesner, who for 30 years worked as an FBI hostage negotiator and conducted talks with numerous terrorist groups including the kidnappers of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, says it was not unusual for families or companies to decide to pay ransoms during his tenure, and that the U.S. was not in the habit of trying to prevent this. ""No prosecutor in the country is going to take a family to court for trying to save the life of their son. It's not going to happen,"" he says. In fact, under Obama, the U.S. government has helped families pay ransoms. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power put the family of journalist Peter Theo Curtis in touch with Qatari officials who helped secure his release from al-Qaida affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the FBI had given the family of American aid worker Warren Weinstein advice on paying ransoms before he was killed by a U.S. drone strike in January, as it has done in numerous other cases. This inconsistency is all the more reason why clarification of U.S. best practices and goals is essential. So, then: What should the policy be? Noesner says the U.S. should not be in the business of making substantive concessions to terrorists, but that shouldn't mean the U.S. doesn't talk to the hostage takers. One might ask what the point of negotiating is if you don't plan on granting concessions, but as Noesner points out, the purpose is ""not only to release the victims but to identify the perpetrators and pursue them."" In his memoir, Noesner writes that in the Daniel Pearl case, ""We were never able to sustain a meaningful dialogue with his captors, but the limited contacts we did have assisted FBI investigators in identifying those responsible through their use of an Internet cafe in Pakistan."" It's not clear yet whether the policy review will allow negotiators more room to maneuver, but one thing that is not likely to change is the prohibition on the U.S. government paying ransoms. Al-Qaida affiliates have raked in tens of millions of dollars from European governments, and the ransoms demanded are reportedly escalating. American officials say that paying ransoms would encourage more kidnappings. David S. Cohen, U.S. undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, has claimed, for instance, that al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, the network's North African affiliate, decided to ""target mainly Europeans, not Americans, for kidnapping operations because AQIM believed that some European governments would pay ransoms while the U.S. government would not."" But this is a tougher claim to make after ISIS's beheadings of Americans Foley, Steven Sotloff, and Peter Kassig. ISIS effectively exploits graphic videotaped violence for propaganda and recruitment services, and none of its videos has garnered as much attention as the ones featuring the killing of U.S. citizens. It's hard to imagine ISIS would be dissuaded from kidnapping another American, if it had the opportunity, by the fact that it was less likely to get a ransom. Meanwhile, it's undoubtedly more dangerous to be British or American in ISIS custody--citizens from other countries, including some that were kept along with Americans, have been released for ransoms. ISIS almost certainly got more ""value"" out of the American and British prisoners it killed than the European ones it ransomed. Not paying ransoms is generally a good policy, but it's a policy, not a law, for a reason: It's possible to imagine circumstances under which different tactics could be used. Overall, it's misguided to suggest that negotiating with terrorists cannot be productive. The goal going forward, which I hope will be articulated in the review findings, should be to do everything possible to prevent kidnappings, to punish those who perpetrate them, and to secure the release of hostages in a responsible way that protects U.S. national security. As blustery sloganeering, ""we don't negotiate with terrorists"" does more harm than good."	"Politicians Always Say, ""We Don't Negotiate With Terrorists."" Of Course We Do, and We Should."

One is Hillary Clinton. The other is radical Islam. And it's not enough to target jihadists with military force, as President Obama has. The Republicans say we must go further. We must identify radical Islam as the enemy. Two months ago, campaigning in New Hampshire, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker declared: ""We need a commander-in-chief in this country who stands up once and for all and says our biggest threat is radical Islamic terrorism."" Walker asserted that ""radical Islamic terrorism is like a virus, and if you don't take it out entirely, it's like a virus in your computer that will keep coming back."" A week later, announcing his own candidacy, Sen. Ted Cruz described a president (meaning himself) who would explicitly pledge to ""defeat radical Islamic terrorism."" Last weekend, at South Carolina's Republican state convention, other 2016 hopefuls piled on. Rick Santorum said ISIS ""wants to bring back a version of Islam that was popular in the seventh century."" He proposed: ""Let's bomb them back to the seventh century."" Other contenders, including Jeb Bush, spoke of Christians and Jews under assault. Rick Perry likened the current struggle to the Cold War. He called for ""the same resolve that we [had] to defeat Soviet Communism."" Perry scorned any comparison between Muslim and Christian violence. ""We need a president who's not an apologist for radical Islamist terrorism, suggesting that it's just like the Crusades and the Inquisition,"" he said. Wednesday morning, Mike Huckabee joined the chorus. Our enemies, he explained, are ""rooted in Islamic jihadism. Whether it's al-Qaida, ISIS, they're all leaves from the same tree."" Obama's great failing, said Huckabee, was that ""he will not identify this enemy as Islamic jihadism."" Superficially, the candidates are correct. ISIS, al-Qaida, and their ilk are Islamic. These groups represent a segment of Islam, though certainly not the whole faith. But the GOP's demagogy around this issue--courting Christians and Jews by depicting Islam as a particularly sick or violent religion--reflects and perpetuates ignorance of religious history. Christians and Jews aren't immune to the fanaticism that's convulsing Islam. We've been through it before. That lesson emerged this week from the Faith Angle Forum, a two-day conference on religion and public life. The speakers weren't politicians or Muslims. They were scholars of ISIS or of religious history. So they felt no need to whitewash or exaggerate the connections between Islam and violence. Bernard Haykel, a professor at Princeton, led off the discussion. While drawing distinctions--Salafism is just one branch of Islam, violent jihadists are a minority within Salafism, and ISIS is a peculiar statist faction of killers--Haykel trashed the academic pretense that ISIS isn't Islamic. Its ideology, he noted, is what attracts its followers. Its leaders enforce Islamic laws and present well-informed, albeit warped, interpretations of sacred texts. But Haykel also trashed the idea that terrorism should be fought like Communism. ISIS isn't a serious threat to the West, he argued. Its focus is on fomenting war among Muslims, not between Muslims and Christians. It targets Shia, Sufis, and Arab regimes it views as apostates. Will McCants, a Brookings Institution fellow and former U.S. adviser on terrorism, made the same point. ISIS and other Salafists think their job is to save Islam. They see themselves as reformers. In the United States, reform connotes peaceful, constructive change. Cruz, Huckabee, Perry, Santorum, and Walker all claim to be reformers. But reform also has a bloody history. In this century's Arab upheavals, Haykel hears echoes of the Protestant Reformation. In Martin Luther's time, too, there was a decline of traditional authority, an empowering revolution in information technology, a religious backlash against corruption, and a yearning for primordial clarity of faith, including a direct understanding of sacred texts. The analogy is ominous. It took Christians more than a century of fighting before they conclusively renounced religious war. Jonathan Sacks, Britain's former chief rabbi, extended this analogy in the conference's closing session. He argued that the pattern of religious civil war goes back not just to the Reformation, but to Jewish uprisings of the first and second centuries. The Great Revolt against Rome, the Diaspora Revolt, and the Bar Kokhba rebellion nearly wiped out the Jewish people. Only after decades of bloodshed did Jews surrender the madness of trying to live in or bring on the apocalypse. Sacks sees the three Abrahamic faiths as sibling rivals. Each is vulnerable to a pathological dualism that can erupt in prolonged violence. Judaism had its bloodbath about 1,500 years after its birth. So did Christianity. Now it's Islam's turn. If Sacks is right, religion per se isn't the source of violence, but it can't claim to be wholly unrelated. And none of the three Abrahamic religions should fancy itself immune. From the standpoint of violence, Sacks argues, Judaism and Christianity aren't better than Islam. They're just older. Can Islam's eruption run its course more quickly, and with less bloodshed, than Judaism's or Christianity's? The speakers offered ideas, but they acknowledged that only Muslims can resolve a Muslim civil war. One thing the rest of us can do is resist political appeals to our naive sense of moral superiority. We're all leaves from the same tree. We can't end Islam's civil war by bombing ISIS back to the seventh century. We certainly shouldn't go around defending the Crusades or the Inquisition. ISIS and al-Qaida are Islamic threats. But what that means, in reality, is that they're a far greater threat to Muslims than to anyone else. And the sickness that produced them isn't a Muslim pathology. It's a human one."	ISIS Isn't the New Soviet Threat
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/05/clinton_cash_peter_schweizer_s_new_book_can_t_prove_anything_against_hillary.html	"Clinton Cash, the much-hyped investigation into Hillary and Bill's cozy relationship with their global patrons that hit bookstores on Tuesday, contains no smoking gun. Conservative author Peter Schweizer fails to prove that Hillary Clinton's actions as a U.S. senator and secretary of state were influenced by the massive amount of cash deep-pocketed foreign donors funneled to the Clintons and the foundation that bears their name. What Schweizer suggests is evidence of quid pro quo is instead little more than post hoc ergo propter hoc speculation. As Clinton defenders will rightly tell you, ""the rooster doesn't cause the sun to rise."" But Schweizer's failure is also a pretty damning success. He is unable to indict the Clintons, but while trying to he stumbles onto a more important truth: It is impossible to separate money from power in the highest spheres of influence and politics that the Clintons call home. That the two are inextricably intertwined is often shrugged off as simply unavoidable in modern politics, but Clinton Cash offers a needed illustration of what that truism can mean in the real world. That the Clintons can offer no exonerating evidence in their defense only drives the point home further. Schweizer can't show the Clintons allowed themselves to be influenced by foreign cash, and the Clintons can't definitively prove they weren't, for much the same reason; in a political system where the inputs and outputs are both money and power, proof of guilt or innocence simply can't exist. This chicken-and-egg conundrum is hardly breaking news. The possibility of favor trading or conflicts of interest hangs over almost every decision in Washington. Does a donor write a check to a politician because their interests overlap? Or do their interests align because the donor cuts that check? Those are impossible questions to answer, but we don't need answers to know they are worth asking. And for all its flaws--of which there are many--Clinton Cash is predicated on asking. The Clintons are not responsible for the broken system from which they benefit any more than any other politician who profits from his or her own personal brand. And the zero-sum nature of campaign politics makes looking only at Hillary at this moment in many ways unfair--particularly given Schweizer and like-minded conservatives are more concerned with convicting her in the court of public opinion than having an honest debate about the larger problems illustrated by the Clintons' sprawling network of friends, allies, and benefactors. However, with the weight of Bill and Hillary's combined influence--past, present, and future--on matters of U.S. policy, the Clintons are an appropriate vehicle through which to discuss the conflicts of interest that plague our political system. It's become common for ex-presidents to cash in on the speaking circuit or launch high-profile foundations after leaving office, but Bill was the first to do so while his wife played a direct role in U.S. policy, first as a senator and then as secretary of state. Such conflicts of interest are only compounded by the fact that Bill is the first former president to have a realistic chance of finding himself back in the White House as first gentleman. To take but one of many, many examples from Clinton Cash and the more even-handed independent reporting that it has prompted: Bill accepted millions of dollars in speaking fees from a number of foreign companies and individuals with interests pending before the State Department while Hillary was secretary of state. That is no longer in dispute. That there's nothing to suggest the Clintons promised political favors in exchange doesn't change the reality that no speech is actually worth six-figures all on its own. Even if Hillary were able to separate Bill's earnings--and the promise of his future ones--from her official actions, the foreign entities cutting those checks would still be, at least implicitly, paying for the appearance of access to a former president and current secretary of state. There's a reason, after all, that Bill was able to charge more for speaking engagements when Hillary was leading the State Department then he did immediately after leaving office. That perception of access has real impacts, both in the financial marketplace and the political one, and for the Clintons to refuse to acknowledge that reality is willfully naive at best, and intentionally dishonest at worst. (The couple's less-than-stellar track record when it comes to matters of transparency only makes these questions more urgent.) But you don't need to believe the Clintons are guilty of wrongdoing to know that there is something wrong with the system. In a perfect world we'd hold every politician to account for the conflicts of interest that are unavoidable in our political system. But in the imperfect world we live in we need to start somewhere--and the top is a better place than most. Bill and Hillary Clinton are clearly at the top. They didn't rig the game, but it is evident from Clinton Cash and the reporting that has already followed in its wake that they've come close to perfecting how to play it. They've managed to become incredibly wealthy as a result of both the power that they've wielded in the past and the promise of the power that they may wield in the future. It is fitting, after all, that in defending the Clintons, their allies are choosing to compare Hillary to the sun, and everyone else to mere roosters reduced to crowing at her."	Clinton Cash Can't Prove Anything Against Hillary. Maybe That's the Point.

5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/05/u_s_troops_have_stolen_tens_of_millions_in_iraq_and_afghanistan_center_for.html	"U.S. Army Specialist Stephanie Charboneau sat at the center of a complex trucking network in Forward Operating Base Fenty near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border that distributed daily tens of thousands of gallons of what troops called ""liquid gold"": the refined petroleum that fueled the international coalition's vehicles, planes, and generators. A prominent sign in the base read: ""The Army Won't Go If The Fuel Don't Flow."" But Charboneau, 31, a mother of two from Washington state, felt alienated after a supervisor's harsh rebuke. Her work was a dreary routine of recording fuel deliveries in a computer and escorting trucks past a gate. But it was soon to take a dark turn into high-value crime. She began an affair with a civilian, Jonathan Hightower, who worked for a Pentagon contractor that distributed fuel from Fenty, and one day in March 2010 he told her about ""this thing going on"" at other U.S. military bases around Afghanistan, she recalled in a recent telephone interview. Troops were selling the U.S. military's fuel to Afghan locals on the side, and pocketing the proceeds. When Hightower suggested they start doing the same, Charboneau said, she agreed. In so doing, Charboneau contributed to thefts by U.S. military personnel of at least $15 million worth of fuel since the start of the U.S. war in Afghanistan. And eventually she became one of at least 115 enlisted personnel and military officers convicted since 2005 of committing theft, bribery, and contract-rigging crimes valued at $52 million during their deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq, according to a comprehensive tally of court records by the Center for Public Integrity. Many of these crimes grew out of shortcomings in the military's management of the deployments that experts say are still present: a heavy dependence on cash transactions, a hasty award process for high-value contracts, loose and harried oversight within the ranks, and a regional culture of corruption that proved seductive to the Americans troops transplanted there. Charboneau, whose Facebook posts reveal a bright-eyed woman with a shoulder tattoo and a huge grin, snuggling with pets and celebrating the 2015 New Year with her children in Seattle Seahawks jerseys, now sits in Carswell federal prison in Fort Worth, Texas, serving a seven-year sentence for her crime. Additional crimes by military personnel are still under investigation, and some court records remain partly under seal. The magnitude of additional losses from fraud, waste, and abuse by contractors, civilians, and allied foreign troops in Afghanistan has never been tallied, but officials probing such crimes say the total is in the billions of dollars. And those who investigate and prosecute military wrongdoing say the convictions so far constitute a small portion of the crimes they think were committed by U.S. military personnel in the two countries. Former Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction Stuart Bowen, who served as the principal watchdog for wrongdoing in Iraq from 2004 to 2013, said he suspected ""the fraud ... among U.S. military personnel and contractors was much higher"" than what he and his colleagues were able to prosecute. John F. Sopko, his contemporary counterpart in Afghanistan, said his agency has probably uncovered less than half of the fraud committed by members of the military in Afghanistan. As of February, he said he had 327 active investigations still under way, involving 31 members of the military. ""You don't appreciate how much money is being stolen in Afghanistan until you go over there,"" said Sopko, who says price-fixing and other forms of financial corruption are rampant in Afghanistan. These and other experts, as well as some of those who have pleaded guilty to criminal wrongdoing, point to some recurrent patterns in the corrupt activity, which in turn illustrate the special challenges created when a sizable military force is deployed abroad. Sometimes ill-trained military personnel were forced to handle or oversee large cash transactions, in a region where casual corruption in financial dealings--bribes, kickbacks, and petty theft--was commonplace. Commanding officers, they add, were typically so distracted by urgent war challenges that they could not carefully check for missing fuel or contractor kickbacks. So far, officers account for approximately four-fifths of the value of the fraud committed by military personnel in Iraq, while in Afghanistan, the ratio was flipped, with enlistees accounting for roughly the same portion, according to the Center for Public Integrity's tally. The reasons for the difference are unclear. But Sopko said he expects more officers to be investigated for misconduct in Afghanistan as the U.S. military mission there continues, so the ratio could change. Troops who had little or no prior criminal history, like Charboneau, say the circumstances of their deployments made stealing with impunity look easy, and so they made decisions that to their surprise eventually brought them prison sentences ranging from three months to more than 17 years. Many, like Charboneau, were savvy about the military's way of doing things--her mother, her first husband, and her second husband were service members, according to a statement her lawyer, Dennis Hartley, filed on Jan. 30, 2014, before her sentencing. They say that they knew of other military personnel who also broke the law, but without getting caught. Hightower convinced her to steal fuel from Fenty, Charboneau said, by pointing out that the troops at nearby bases ""aren't getting caught, so you shouldn't have to worry about it."" Retired Army Reserve Maj. Glenn MacDonald, editor-in-chief of the website MilitaryCorruption.com, said the volume and value of fraud committed by troops in Afghanistan and Iraq seem higher to him than what he recalled as a young soldier in Vietnam in the 1960s. ""What you can make out of these [recent] wars is staggering. It's an opportunity for anybody, even a noncommissioned officer, to become very rich overnight,"" MacDonald said. Many have probably been tempted, he said, because they saw others getting away with the theft of thousands or even millions of dollars. Pocketing thousands in cash from illicit fuel sales Military fuel in Iraq and Afghanistan has been a perennial target of theft during the past 14 years of war. In Afghanistan, fuel moved around the country in ""jingle trucks,"" tankers adorned with kaleidoscopic patterns and metal ornaments. At Fenty, for example, jingle trucks bearing fuel arrived every few days from suppliers in Pakistan, all driven by locals under contracts with the base. Officers at Fenty then distributed it to 32 nearby bases, with the largest ones using up to 2 million gallons of fuel a week. To describe the system as loosely controlled might be an understatement: Standard contracts allowed each driver to take seven days to bring the fuel to a destination that might be only a few hours away, according to Army Maj. Jonathan McDougal, who oversaw motor vehicle logistics in northeast Afghanistan in 2010 and 2011 from Bagram Airfield. ""It was like they planned for something to go wrong with every convoy,"" McDougal told the Center for Public Integrity. Charboneau's role in the Fenty fuel theft ring was simple. She ordered trucks to transport more fuel than needed, then filed fake records showing the extra fuel had been delivered to a base. After leaving Fenty in a convoy, the extra trucks diverted their loads to prearranged meeting spots, where buyers offloaded the fuel and paid in cash, with the proceeds divided later among Charboneau and her co-conspirators. The scheme worked--for a while--because the fuel storage amounts and truck delivery amounts matched (although of course the bases' records of delivered fuel did not). This represented, Charboneau said, ""a big gap"" in the fuel oversight system. And the rewards were enticing--about $5,000 in net profit from a single extra truckload. One month after she joined the scheme, according to the government's sentencing memo, filed on Jan. 15, 2014, in U.S. District Court in Colorado, her supervisor, Sgt. Christopher Weaver, jumped in. She described the widening of the conspiracy in instant messages intended for her sister in Colorado, sent using the screen name ""dollface_kc"": Although prosecutor Mark Dubester said in the sentencing memo that Charboneau's use of the term lmao (Internet slang for ""laughing my ass off"") demonstrated that she ""saw humor in the situation,"" Charboneau said she did not. When she returned to Fenty, she said, Weaver pulled her aside and told her that he knew how everything worked, and while he had not made much money off of the scheme so far, it would be wise of her to keep her mouth shut. ""It was ... one of those things that, 'if you tell anybody, you're probably going to be sorry,'"" said Charboneau. ""I was his subordinate. He was in charge."" ""Thereafter, the conspiracy continued with all three involved, and this is when the bulk of the thefts occurred,"" according to the sentencing memo that Dubester submitted. Weaver met with Charboneau and Hightower each morning to decide which trucks would make legitimate deliveries and which trucks were ""going to go get stolen,"" Charboneau said in the interview. If someone had simply asked more questions about the deliveries--such as ""'I need to know where you're sending these 15 trucks. Oh, you don't have a destination for these five?""--it would have been much harder to pull off the scheme, Charboneau said. She, Weaver, and Hightower were able to continue stealing as long as they did, she said, because they were the only three people entrusted with keeping track of where the fuel went when it left the base. Digital monitoring could also have stopped theft at military bases, she said. Scanning the fingerprints of the drivers when they left Fenty and arrived at the destination bases, for instance, would have deterred them from selling it on the side, according to Charboneau. Weaver pleaded guilty to counts of conspiracy and bribery on Oct. 10, 2012, and is now serving a sentence of three years and one month in a federal prison in South Dakota. His former attorney declined to speak on the record about the case. In a letter to Chief U.S. District Judge Marcia Krieger that Weaver filed with an October 2013 sentencing statement, Weaver wrote that he had originally taken the money to hire a lawyer because his ""child's mother was threatening to take my son away from me."" ""Of course, I took more than was needed,"" he added. ""I got greedy once I started."" Hightower also pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the United States and was sentenced on Oct. 28, 2013, to two years and three months in prison. He is serving his term in a federal prison in San Antonio. The thefts alone caused more than $1.5 million in losses to the United States, according to the plea agreement that Charboneau eventually signed on Sept. 5, 2013. Her attorney, Hartley, told the court that her crime had also humiliated her husband, whose own Army unit had learned about it. Charboneau said she is now haunted by how ""I was so proud to be in the military, [and then] doing what I did."" After seven years as a soldier, trained to respect and trust her supervisors completely, she said, it was ""really hard"" to find out that a superior was engaging in theft. Her advice to young troops deploying to Afghanistan today would be to ""keep to themselves, learn the job that they need to learn,"" and if confronted with a proposal similar to the one Hightower laid at her feet, just say no. ""It wasn't worth the forty-some-odd thousand dollars I made to be in prison for seven years, to be away from my ... family,"" she said. Charboneau started serving her sentence in February, after a court-approved delay of five-and-a-half months, so she could briefly take care of her third child, Tate, who was born in July; all three of her children are now being looked after by her mother. In an email to the Center for Public Integrity, Charboneau wrote that she was adjusting all right to prison but missed her kids, especially her newborn. ""[I]'m afraid most days he will forget me,"" she wrote. A tangle of emotions and crime Court filings in more than 100 cases reviewed by the Center for Public Integrity show that many of the military personnel who wound up being convicted had earlier received honors and awards, and were well-regarded by their uniformed colleagues. Charboneau, for instance, won two medals for her service in the Fenty operations office. She received the first just months before she began stealing fuel with Hightower and Weaver. So what makes such military personnel turn to crime? The inspectors general for both war zones said criminal actions were provoked partly by the high volume of cash and resources flowing into the countries. ""The more money you throw into a weak-rule-of-law situation, the more fraud you'll see,"" said Bowen. Todd Conormon, a lawyer who served in Iraq in 2004 and now defends service members accused of wrongdoing, said that for some, the sheer pressure of combat ""has a debilitating effect, and maybe makes it easier ... to rationalize, 'Well, I deserve this.' "" Others grew used to seeing corruption all around them--like the widespread financial impropriety Sopko described--and convinced themselves that a little more wouldn't interfere with the essential goals of the U.S. mission, Conormon said. For some, the urge to steal was wrapped up in other temptations, such as an illicit romance with another service member, according to court documents. An Army captain from Tacoma, Washington, named Cedar Lanmon, who served in Iraq on two deployments from 2004 to 2007, accepted gifts worth tens of thousands of dollars in exchange for helping the Albanian owner of a company called ""Just in Time Contracting"" obtain a $250,000 contract from the U.S. military, according to a complaint filed against him on Nov. 15, 2007, by U.S. Army Criminal Investigative Division Special Agent Derek Lindbom. He wound up getting caught after his estranged wife--referred to by her first initial T in the complaint -- called Lindbom's agency to describe her husband's misdeeds, financial and marital: After Lanmon proposed that his wife join him and the new girlfriend in a ""polygamous marriage,"" according to the document, the couple ""became estranged as husband and wife."" Lanmon served one year in federal prison and was released on Sept. 11, 2009. A Washington state phone number under his name had been disconnected when the Center for Public Integrity tried to reach him. Other fraud schemes in Iraq and Afghanistan occurred with the full knowledge--and sometimes the complicity--of the service member's spouse. U.S. Marine Corps Capt. Eric Schmidt and his wife, Janet, engaged in theft and contract fraud during his deployment as a contracting officer at Camp Fallujah in Iraq in 2008 and 2009. They netted a total of $1.69 million, according to the sentencing memo that Assistant U.S. Attorney Dorothy McLaughlin filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on Feb. 3, 2011. They were an efficient team. Eric Schmidt helped Iraqis pilfer equipment from the base, such as generators and air conditioners, and steered military reconstruction contracts to one local firm in particular, according to the sentencing memo. Janet Schmidt arranged for U.S. companies to supply smaller quantities or substandard versions of the equipment that the chosen Iraqi firm was supposed to be producing, the sentencing memo said. When the products arrived in Iraq, Eric signed a Defense Department form stating that the shipments had been sent by the Iraqi firm. The firm then sent the U.S. government a bill Janet had prepared, and when it was paid, the firm shared the proceeds with the Schmidts. The scheme escaped notice during the year Eric Schmidt was deployed to Iraq, according to Daniel F. Willkens, a former head of investigations for Stuart Bowen. Schmidt even roped in two subordinate Marines to help him with the scheme, according to the sentencing memo. One of them, Staff Sgt. Eric Hamilton, received $124,000 from Schmidt and the Iraqi contractors for painting circles on generators in the military storage yard at Fallujah to show which ones they could take and then unlocking the gate when the contractors came to get them, according to charges filed in the U.S. District Court for South Carolina on July 27, 2011. Hamilton pleaded guilty to the charges on Aug. 10, 2011, according to his plea agreement. Eric and Jane Schmidt were caught by chance. In 2009, five months after Eric Schmidt had returned to the United States and the couple had purchased costly property in California, Schmidt was arrested for assaulting his wife. While state police were inside the home, they noticed he had $10,000 in cash and that the bills were stamped with the imprint of an Iraqi bank. Investigators from Bowen's agency, the Pentagon, and the IRS were eventually able to confirm the money had come from Iraq and pieced together the rest of the story by examining the Schmidts' financial transactions and correspondence. In the last report that Bowen's agency submitted to Congress, in September 2013, the Schmidts' case was described as the ""biggest catch"" of a special data mining team in his agency. In 2011, Eric Schmidt was sentenced to six years in prison while his wife was sentenced to one year of home confinement and two additional years of probation. The couple was ordered to pay the U.S. government $2.1 million in restitution, including income tax. ""Most of our cases were triggered by unexpected tips [revealed by] someone who had their conscience pricked and came forward,"" said Bowen. Because the whistleblowers could be endangered by receiving public credit, they are rarely mentioned in court documents. Sopko confirmed that most of the cases his agency successfully investigates come from tips, when service members call government corruption hotlines or when disgruntled representatives of military services companies come forward to complain that a rival seems to be getting all the prime contract awards. Charboneau's scheme, for instance, was uncovered after Weaver talked about it with a sergeant with whom he was romantically involved, she said. In Afghanistan, Sopko and his investigators typically use sources, undercover techniques, and firsthand testimony. Because recordkeeping in the country has been poor, he said, ""we don't just rely on paper."" The contract fraud model One exception was an elaborate contract-rigging scheme that culminated in the longest prison sentence given to any U.S. service member for fraud in Iraq or Afghanistan. It began, according to court documents, as Army Maj. Eddie Pressley arrived at Camp Arifjan in Kuwait in October 2004 to work as a contracting specialist, ordering supplies for the base. Just before his arrival, he had received an Army Commendation Medal for exceptional service as a military recruiter. His roommate at the base was another Army major, John Cockerham, who reviewed and awarded bids for Defense Department contracts to support the U.S. Army's operations around the Middle East. By the time Pressley arrived, Cockerham had already been at the camp for three months--and had begun awarding contracts for goods such as bottled water in exchange for bribes, according to an indictment filed by a San Antonio grand jury against Cockerham on Aug. 22, 2007. During a trial hearing on Dec. 12, 2009, Cockerham's attorney, Jimmy Parks, said Cockerham agreed to participate in these schemes after a ""lot of cajoling and convincing"" by contractors, who told Cockerham that ""our God requires that we bless you"" for giving them ""a chance to do business."" Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Pletcher responded that the payments had not been blessings, ""just bribes."" By March 2005, Pressley was likewise collecting bribes for awarding contracts and ordering extra goods under those contracts, according to the indictment that an Alabama grand jury filed against him on May 1, 2009. The men arranged for their wives to visit, collect the cash profits, and take the money home or send it to foreign bank accounts. When an Army major and West Point graduate named James Momon arrived in the summer of 2005, Pressley and Cockerham took him for a ride in their jeep and described how their bribery scheme worked, according to descriptions of sealed testimony by Momon that federal prosecutor Peter Sprung and Pressley's attorney, Clyde Riley, gave at February 2011 court hearings in Decatur, Alabama. According to Sprung, Momon said Cockerham and Pressley explained how they got the bribe money from the contractors, and how their wives and relatives helped move the illicit funds out of the country. Court records and published reports by Bowen's agency do not detail how the investigation began, but in late December 2006, federal agents executed a search warrant on Cockerham's San Antonio home and discovered what they said was a highly incriminating ledger. Cockerham had a compulsion to write down ""everything from his dreams to the amounts of money he took,"" according to Willkens. He neatly listed the names of contracting companies that paid him bribes, along with the values of the bribes he had already received and those he expected to receive. Of the $15 million he eventually hoped to receive in bribes, Pletcher told the court in the 2009 hearing, Cockerham had designated 10 percent to be used for building a church. In total, Cockerham, Pressley, and Momon collected at least $14 million in bribes, according to court documents detailing the conduct of which they were convicted. Cockerham ended up receiving 171/2 years in prison, the longest sentence given to any service member convicted of fraud in the two countries. At least seven other troops in Iraq and Kuwait were convicted of participating in the conspiracy. A military-veteran-turned-contractor who investigators say played a pivotal role in the case, George Lee, pleaded guilty in February to paying a bribe to one of the lieutenants and is now in a Philadelphia jail. The conspiracy--and the suicide of an Army officer who killed herself in 2006 after confessing to federal agents that she had accepted at least $225,000 in bribes from Lee--has garnered wide attention. The challenges of bringing a successful case in the middle of war Sopko and others warn that the steady flow of military reconstruction funds into the two countries will not soon subside, with the deployment of 10,000 U.S. forces in Afghanistan recently extended to 2016 and new aid and military personnel starting to return to Iraq. But auditors working for Sopko's agency face increasing restrictions in Afghanistan. Military officials have told Sopko's agency that they would only provide civilian investigators access to areas within a one-hour round trip of an advanced medical facility so that the U.S. government can provide them ""adequate security and rapid emergency medical support,"" according to a report Sopko's agency issued in 2013. As a result, in 2014, Sopko's investigators were only able to access one-fifth of the country. Moreover, because the U.S. embassy in Kabul is shrinking, Sopko has been instructed to cut his staff there by 40 percent, to just 25 positions, by mid-2016. Everyone in Afghanistan, including his on-the-ground investigators, Sopko wrote in his agency's report, will struggle over the next few years ""to continue providing the direct U.S. civilian oversight that is needed in Afghanistan."" Investigators say that even now, some service members whom they strongly suspect of fraud wind up getting away without prosecution because investigators simply cannot muster the evidence to bring them to trial, or because they prefer to go after large cases while letting smaller ones go. In Iraq, recalled Willkens, he and his fellow investigators were sure they had uncovered the culprits behind certain lucrative crimes, but were equally sure they would not be able to prove it because the proceeds were stashed in inaccessible overseas accounts. Bowen and Willkens also complained that stiff penalties were not assessed as often as they wished. ""I suspected that many of these guys that we caught were perfectly happy to go to prison for a few years,"" because they had much more money stashed overseas in places with little banking regulation, such as Cyprus or Jordan, Bowen said. ""Prison was the cost of doing business for them."" Other oversight officials confirmed that the amounts of money the U.S. government receives from service members convicted of fraud is rarely commensurate with their crimes. Restitution or forfeiture are set at whatever levels the judge decides is deserved, within the sentencing guidelines. In bribery schemes, for example, it is ""often difficult to define specifically the loss to the government,"" according to Peter Carr, a U.S. Justice Department spokesman. Part of the challenge, according to Willkens, is that fraud is seen as a white-collar, nonviolent crime. If the service members who stole millions from the U.S. government had taken the same amount during an armed robbery of a bank, he said, they would receive much higher penalties. ""Robbing the government is seen as a victimless crime,"" Willkens added. ""It's not.""

Our younger son leaped out of bed and screamed: ""There's something wrong!"" But there was nothing wrong. It was a false alarm, and the fact that the department had been able to spare three trucks for it was a sign that things had started to quiet down in the city. Curious neighbors stepping onto their porches were left to contemplate a particularly incongruous moment for the Baltimore Idyll. What is the Baltimore Idyll? It is one of the East Coast's best-kept secrets, to which my family and I returned two years ago from Washington. It is the swath of a major city within easy reach of Washington and New York where middle- and barely upper-middle-class professionals can live in a style that their counterparts in those cities could never dream of. They can buy grand 19th-century townhouses or gabled Victorians with wraparound porches for the price of a one-bedroom apartment in Park Slope or Dupont Circle. A short drive from their leafy neighborhoods--the Idyll is based in a large contiguous expanse of the northern section of the city, with pockets in the central, southern, and southeastern--they can enjoy superb theater and a top-tier symphony orchestra, at modest prices. They can get into excellent restaurants without a wait, frequent unimpeachably authentic bars, see first-run films in Art Deco splendor, pick up growlers from breweries in old mills, take runs on wooded streambed paths. They can raise their children with less of the high-achiever stress than one finds in more exclusive locales. These are not gentrifiers--the neighborhoods they live in have, for the most part, been desirable addresses from the start. They are not particularly affluent people who are getting to live the way relatively ordinary people could once live in cities that have now gotten fancy. But there is a catch. The Idyll is so attainable for nonaristocracy because it is located within a deeply troubled city. It requires a relatively healthy local economy for its sustenance. But if Baltimore's economy were stronger, if its poorer neighborhoods were not so racked by violence and despair, and if the notoriety of that violence and despair did not so shadow the city's national reputation, the Baltimore Idyll would not be so affordable for the shabbily genteel--it's as simple as that. The city with one of the most appealing and accessible urban areas in the country is the same city that has some of the country's most devastated neighborhoods, and this is not entirely a coincidence. It is an awkward truth, and many in the Idyll understandably try not to dwell on it too much. But last week, the Idyll was confronted, in the starkest possible terms, with the full picture of its bargain with the city. Not that everyone needed reminding. Reality impinges on the Idyll at every turn, which is, in fact, part of what many of its inhabitants like about it. Police helicopters fly over it at night, heading to the high-crime area in the city's northwest; the Sun, where I once worked as a reporter, duly reports on the previous night's homicides. The Idyll is full of social workers, journalists, public defenders--people whose days are spent in the rest of the city. Volunteers and civic activists abound in the Idyll. And casual brushes with reality happen all the time, too, because as segregated as this majority-black city is, it is in fact not as racially and economically divided as many other major cities (in part because it retains a black middle class and a white working class, though both are dwindling). The most convenient Target is at Mondawmin Mall, at the initial locus of last week's unrest, rather than in the suburbs. Realms collide at Druid Hill Park, the vast, verdant gem in the heart of the city. My son's baseball team, based in the Idyll, was thrashed by an all-black squad from Northeast Baltimore last year and will soon visit a West Side team not far from Freddie Gray's neighborhood. His school orchestra gave its holiday concert in profoundly ungentrified Lexington Market downtown. The Idyll itself is heavily but not entirely white. The kindergarten through eighth-grade public school in the heart of the Idyll is diverse. And despite Baltimore's many private schools, not a few Idyll families send their kids to the city's magnet high schools. Still, there is no getting around the appalling disparities. The life expectancy in Roland Park, in North Baltimore, is 20 years longer than in the city's poorest neighborhoods. Never are the disparities more apparent than on the day of the Baltimore Marathon, when hundreds of hyperfit Idyll residents run for miles through the blighted expanse of East Baltimore while being cheered on by locals in less healthy physical condition. Confronted with these gaps, those in the Idyll can assure themselves that it is still better that they are in the city, disparities and all. And they are right. One of the major differences between Baltimore and, say, Detroit is that the former retains a sizable portion of middle- and upper-middle-class residents paying hefty property taxes to it and still feeling fully invested in the city. I've used that rationalization myself. And I've gone a step further to justify my happy existence in the Idyll since returning to it: becoming an ardent booster for the city, trying to spread word of the good life here, bridling at every slight or drive-by flawed portrayal by members of the Acela Corridor media. Sure, improving public perception of the city and spurring demand for the Idyll might raise the price of existence here, but I didn't care--I had decided the city was pretty wonderful and wanted the world to know. But of course my depiction of the good life was an incomplete one. And the city needs more than just promotion. I have tried to do my small part in actual uplift over the years, but I must do more. We all must: It's what the Idyll owes the city for the immensely favorable terms of the deal we're getting. And if things really do start to get better for the city, for the whole city, so that the Idyll dissolves into a more general prosperity--oh, how we will cheer that loss."	The Awkward Truth About Living the Good Life in Baltimore
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/05/marilyn_mosby_is_charging_six_baltimore_police_officers_with_freddie_gray.html	"On Friday morning, Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby announced the results of Freddie Gray's autopsy. The report is clear. His fatal neck injury--a nearly severed spine--was the result of being handcuffed but not fully secured in the police wagon. Specifically, Gray was bound by his wrists and ankles and left stomach down on the floor of the van as it drove around West Baltimore. At least two officers checked on Gray's status during the drive, but they didn't act when he said he couldn't breathe. Despite his pleas and ""rapidly deteriorating"" condition, he received no medical assistance. When he finally arrived at the station, he was in cardiac arrest. But there's more. According to Mosby, the arrest itself was illegal. Police had no cause for detaining Gray, not even for possession of a weapon; the knife they found in his pocket was not a switchblade and thus was legal under Maryland law. ""No crime had been committed by Mr. Gray,"" said Mosby. In short, Gray was wrongly detained by police and fatally injured under their care. Indeed, the six officers--Officer Caesar Goodson Jr., Officer William Porter, Lt. Brian Rice, Officer Edward Nero, Officer Garrett Miller, and Sgt. Alicia White--knew Gray needed medical help, knew he could die or be seriously injured, and chose not to act, ensuring his fate. His death, said Mosby, was a homicide. It's a definitive rebuke to the Baltimore Police Department, which suggested--in a release to the media--that Gray had killed himself. As such, Mosby's office is charging everyone connected to Gray's death. Goodson will face charges of second-degree depraved heart murder (a ""callous disregard for human life""), involuntary manslaughter, second-degree assault, manslaughter by vehicle, and misconduct in office. Porter will face charges of involuntary manslaughter, second-degree assault, and misconduct in office. Rice will face charges of the same, plus false imprisonment, while Nero and Miller will face charges of second-degree assault, misconduct in office, and false imprisonment. And White will face charges of assault, misconduct, and false imprisonment in addition to manslaughter. They've been suspended from duty, and warrants have been issued for their arrests. On Twitter, the reaction was genuine surprise. And for good reason. It is extraordinarily rare for police to face criminal charges. ""Among the thousands of fatal shootings at the hands of police since 2005,"" notes the Washington Post in a recent look at police violence, ""only 54 officers have been charged."" And in Maryland, with its high rate of ""justifiable homicides"" by law enforcement, police officers were charged with crimes in less than 2 percent of cases where a civilian died. No, Gray's death wasn't a shooting. But these charges challenge the pattern. The choice to charge the officers was a legal one. That said, it's hard to dismiss the optics of Baltimore's leadership. Mosby is black. Police Commissioner Anthony Batts is black. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake is black. Descriptive representation hasn't solved the city's problems, but compared with the leadership of a city like Ferguson, there's a chance these leaders have closer ties to their constituents and a better finger on the pulse of the community. Between the protests and the riots and the general discontent--easily heard in any casual conversation among Baltimoreans over the last week--officials had to have known that no charges would turn a volatile situation dangerous. To be clear, there's no guarantee the charges will stick. The killer of Rekia Boyd--an off-duty Chicago cop who fired into a group of people, believing one had reached for a gun, and killed the unarmed Boyd--was charged with involuntary manslaughter. He was acquitted. But if the problem of police violence is, in part, a problem of accountability, then the charges are important, regardless of what comes next. In so many words, the city of Baltimore has said that these officers were wrong: That Freddie Gray's life mattered, that his death shouldn't have happened, and that wearing a badge doesn't mean you're not responsible.

8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/04/hillary_clinton_s_impressive_criminal_justice_speech_the_democratic_front.html	"There's plenty to quibble with in Hillary Clinton's speech on mass incarceration and criminal justice reform, which she gave on Wednesday at Columbia University. She doesn't make mention of the 1994 crime bill, signed by her husband, which pushed states to build--and fill--more prisons with more offenders. She treats mass incarceration as a function of nonviolent crime, when the truth is more difficult. Half of the people in state prisons are there for violent crimes, and many nonviolent offenders have violent histories. To reduce incarceration, we need to rethink punishment for violent offenders, too. There, Clinton is silent. But the problems and omissions in Clinton's speech shouldn't blind us to the fact that it's a remarkable piece of political rhetoric, both in its own right and for what it says about American politics in 2015. Two days after riots in Baltimore--at a time when most of the presidential field is either silent or contemptuous--Clinton has stepped out front with a forward-looking agenda on bringing people out of prison, a definitive rebuke to the ""law and order"" politics used by her husband throughout his career. Not only did Clinton call for an end to ""the era of mass incarceration,"" but she also connected our prison population to broader patterns of inequality. ""Without the mass incarceration that we currently practice, millions fewer people would be living in poverty,"" she said. ""And it's not just families trying to stay afloat with one parent behind bars. Of the 600,000 prisoners who re-enter society each year, roughly 60 percent face long-term unemployment."" We have to do more than release nonviolent offenders to solve mass incarceration, but this at least shows that Clinton is thinking in broad terms. Reducing the prison population is the beginning of the project. What comes next--reintroducing former inmates into mainstream society and giving them a chance to succeed--is just as important. Likewise, Clinton is clearly giving thought to how we restructure policing and punishment. In the speech, she promises to make sure that ""federal funds for state and local law enforcement are used to bolster best practices, rather than to buy weapons of war that have no place on our streets."" She calls for body cameras on all police--a major goal of the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement--supports better, ""swifter"" probation programs, and stresses help for mental health patients. ""You and I know that the promise of de-institutionalizing those in mental health facilities was supposed to be followed by the creation of community-based treatment centers. Well, we got half of that equation--but not the other half."" On a more prosaic note, Clinton alludes to high-profile cases of police abuse and racial violence, directly identifying with black and Latino families on an issue that is polarizing with white Americans. ""You don't have to look too far from this magnificent hall to find children still living in poverty or trapped in failing schools,"" she says, ""Mothers and fathers who fear for their sons' safety when they go off to school--or just to go buy a pack of Skittles."" What's important about this, beyond public policy, is that it's a sign of where Clinton sees the electorate. A Hillary Clinton who believed she needed working class whites to win is not a Hillary Clinton who would embrace this agenda for police reform, or use this rhetoric. No, this Clinton clearly believes that she needs to reconstitute the Obama coalition to win, and to do that, she'll push forward on key issues for black Americans, Latinos, young women, and other members of the Obama electorate. Put differently, this speech is a political gamble as much as it is a policy commitment. To some, that sounds cynical. And maybe it is. But it also doesn't matter. Political science is clear: Presidential candidates don't make idle promises. When they make a commitment or signal a priority, they try to follow through, and when they don't, the party tries to hold them accountable. Now, Clinton is on the record, and if elected, she'll face the kind of pressure that makes policy happen. On that, it's worth a final point. Four years ago, body cameras weren't a priority for national politicians. Now, the Democrats' presumptive nominee for president--who may win next year--has endorsed them for all police officers. Even if its not a panacea for broad problems of police violence, it's still a victory. Not just because Clinton has made the commitment, but because she's sent a powerful signal to other Democrats (and even some Republicans) to treat police reform as a mainstream issue. Competitors like Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley may try to outflank her, but potential allies, either in Congress or elsewhere, will support her message and her leadership. Suddenly, police reform is a Democratic agenda item, something a Democratic Congress and a Democratic White House may act on. For police reform activists, this is vindication. This is what winning looks like."	What Clinton's Criminal Justice Speech Reveals About Her 2016 Campaign

Catherine Pugh, standing near the smoldering remains of the CVS on North Avenue, and handing voter registration forms to anyone who caught her eye. The street was thick with people--children on a day off from school, adults from the neighborhood, a few street musicians, an incense-waving activist, at least two men with bullhorns, and a gaggle of reporters--and it was a good day for any politician to show her face and shake a few hands. After handing a form to a young man and giving him a pen to fill it out, she turned back to finish her pitch for why this--more than ever--was the time for traditional political action. ""I am a senator, I was a city council member. I know that by being there, it does make a difference, and if you don't vote, it doesn't happen."" Pugh is a politician, and politicians--if they do anything--support the system they serve. But you can forgive the residents of West Baltimore--and East Baltimore, both united by huge blocks of long vacant homes and long boarded businesses--if they're cynical about civic engagement. Since the civil rights movement, but especially since the 1968 riots--sparked by Martin Luther King's assassination after 15 years of nonviolent protest--Baltimore has been a largely black city. This is mostly a function of population decline, stemming from the riots. From 1970 to 2000, the city's population fell by nearly one-third, from 906,000 to 651,000. At the same time, the number of black residents rose. In 1950, just 24 percent of Baltimoreans were black. By 1980, it was 54 percent, and by 2000, it was 65 percent. Now, Baltimore is a city of 620,000, and the large majority--63.7 percent--are black. And unlike Ferguson, where demographic strength lagged political representation, Baltimore's black residents have turned their presence into black mayors, black city councils, and black representatives to Annapolis. Far from a rarity, black leadership in Baltimore is a given that even extends to the police. Throughout the 1980s, the city worked to bring black Americans on to the force and promote them up through the ranks. As writer Stacia Brown notes for the New Republic, ""The city believed the presence of black people in politics and law enforcement could foster greater trust and more open communication between black citizens and their government."" All of this was a vital and admirable contribution to the city's civic life. And yet, the basic position of Baltimore's low-income blacks didn't change. In the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood where Freddie Gray lived before he died in police custody on April 12, one-half the residents are unemployed and one-third of the homes are vacant. Sixty percent of residents have less than a high school diploma, and the violent crime rate is among the highest in Baltimore. You can paint a similar picture for the neighborhoods and housing projects on the east side of the city as well. If you are poor and black in Charm City, your life--or at least your opportunity to have a better life--looks bleak. But then, this is by design. In the early 20th century--as in many American cities--Baltimore civic leaders endorsed broad plans to ""protect white neighborhoods"" from black newcomers. The city was flush with waves of immigration--from abroad as well as the South--and more affluent blacks were leaving the older, poorer neighborhoods to move to predominantly white areas removed from the poverty and joblessness of the crowded slums. In short order, politicians and progressive reformers--motivated by benevolence, politics, and an en vogue scientific racism--endorsed segregation plans and racial covenants meant to cordon blacks--as well as Italian and Eastern European immigrants--on to small parts of land in the inner city. By the 1930s, black Americans had grown to 20 percent of Baltimore's population but were confined to 2 percent of the city's landmass. And there was desperate need for new housing, as both formal and informal segregation kept blacks from expanding neighborhoods or moving into white areas (the same was increasingly less true of European immigrants, who--with upward mobility--could integrate into mainstream society). In the 1940s, local, state, and federal leaders pushed public housing to relieve the crisis. But it was segregated. Blacks would receive new housing in their neighborhoods, and working-class whites--in turn--would receive new homes in their own. Five of six public housing projects--McCulloch, Poe, Gilmor, Somerset, and Douglass--would be placed in the most dense black neighborhoods of East and West Baltimore. And while the war boom would deliver partial prosperity, many of these areas still lacked a stable employment base, even as they continued to grow with rapid influxes of new black residents. In 1950--following complaints from white residents over plans to expand public housing--the mayor and the City Council agreed to limit future building to existing ""slum sites"" where the majority of blacks lived. As they had done for the past four decades, white leaders prepared to limit black migration in the city as much as possible. But there was still a housing problem; blacks were still moving to Baltimore, and there weren't enough units for the new residents. Both dynamics, working together, led to a decade-long project of ""urban renewal,"" as the city used federal funds for ""slum removal"" to make way for new, high rise public projects. Renewal displaced 25,000 Baltimoreans--almost all of them black--and the new high-rises were built with segregation in mind. By the time construction was finished, the new projects had bolstered and entrenched the segregation of the past. The black areas of 1964--and of the 1968 riots--are almost identical to the black areas of 50 years prior. There is much, much more to this story. The key part, however, is the remarkable stability of Baltimore's segregation over time. By and large, the ""Negro slums"" of the 1910s are the depressed projects and vacant blocks of the 2010s. And the same pressures of crime and social dislocation continue to press on the modern-day residents of the inner city. If the goal of early segregationist policies was to concentrate black Baltimoreans in a single location, separated from opportunity, then it worked. More importantly, it's never been unraveled; there's never been a full effort to undo and compensate for the policies of the past. Indeed, the two decades of drugs and crime that marred Baltimore in the 1980s and 1990s helped entrench the harm and worsen the scars of the city's history. Baltimore is stuck, captured by the injustices of the past as well as the countless individual choices of the present. The city's ills--its poverty, its fatherlessness, its police violence--are rooted in these same patterns of segregation and discrimination. This isn't an excuse--Baltimore has had a generation of politicians, white and black, who can renovate tourist areas and implement new police techniques, but who can't provide relief and opportunity to its most impoverished residents--but it is important context. Even at their absolute best, the city's leaders have to contend with the cumulative impact of past disadvantage. White flight means a smaller tax base and fewer resources for improvement; industrial collapse means fewer jobs; crack and violence means a generation of ""missing"" black men, in jail or in the ground; a culture of police violence means constant tension with the policed. The simple fact is that major progress in Baltimore--and other, similar cities--requires major investment and major reform from state and federal government. It requires patience, investment, and a national commitment to ending scourges of generational poverty--not just ameliorating them. But that's incredibly difficult, and it's not clear there's any political will to pursue potential solutions. Or, as President Obama said in his remarks on the Baltimore riots, ""If our society really wanted to solve the problem, we could. It's just it would require everybody saying this is important, this is significant."" On Tuesday morning, small groups of people came from across Baltimore to help clean up the wreckage from the previous night, working through the day to sweep glass, remove debris, and help neighbors harmed by looting. ""At first, I was pissed off,"" explained Crystal, who witnessed the riots from her home in West Baltimore. ""But now I'm proud. I've never seen such unity,"" she said, pointing to groups of people sweeping trash from the sidewalks and hauling bags of litter to nearby dumpsters. She wasn't exaggerating. Even as armored cars and police blocked streets and patrolled the area, there was a real feeling of community at the intersection of North and Pennsylvania Avenues. Some residents, like one young woman who took the day off, gave water and food to volunteers, while others spread word of churches and other open spaces where children and teenagers--school was canceled, a casualty of the riots--could study, talk to adults about the turmoil, and grab a meal. Opinions varied on the riots--""I don't support this, let's get that straight right now... cops were wrong, but this was wrong,"" said Raquel, who works with elementary school students--but there was a general sense that, as another woman explained, ""Baltimore takes care of its own."" It's why, at a community meaning that evening, residents (joined briefly by Martin O'Malley, the former Maryland governor and Baltimore mayor) made plans to deliver food to school children, run errands for the elderly, and try as much as possible to keep a presence on the streets to prevent any bad behavior. This spirit wouldn't last. At dusk, the crowd at the intersection had begun to get restless. By nightfall, face-to face-with armed riot police, people were eager for action. It didn't help that Baltimore was under a curfew, announced on Monday. By 10 p.m., the curfew time, demonstrators and community leaders--including Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and House Rep. Elijah Cummings--had gotten hundreds of people out of the street. But, in addition to media, there were dozens of people left, throwing rocks and bottles at the line of officers. After a tense, half-hour standoff, police would act, using tear gas and rubber bullets to break the crowd and clear the streets. It was much better than it could have been. It was also a disappointment. For the second time in two nights, the intersection was marked with chaos and debris. And while volunteers can continue to clean the streets and repair the damage, the anger remains, fueled by recurring--and almost unending--deprivation."	Baltimore's Failure Is Rooted in Decisions That Were Made 100 Years Ago

At a weekend meeting in Miami Beach, Florida, reports the Washington Post, the former Florida governor told 350 of his top donors that his super PAC, Right to Rise, has raised more money in its first 100 days than ""any other Republican operation in modern history."" And while Bush wouldn't specify the total, senior Republicans believe the super PAC is on track to raise $100 million by May's end, dwarfing first-quarter totals from George W. Bush--who raised $37 million in the first four months of 1999--and Mitt Romney, who raised $23 million in the first quarter of 2007. Jeb Bush's total is astounding. But it also belies an important difference among him, his brother, and even Mitt Romney. In presidential politics, fundraising is as much about signaling strength as it is building resources. Dubya's multimillion-dollar haul did more than fund a campaign: It made him the most dominant candidate in the race, dissuading some Republicans from taking the risk and shutting others--like former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander--out of the competition. Build enough of this party strength, and--like George W. Bush--you can coast to the nomination sans a serious challenge. And even if you can't, you can at least influence the caliber of your opponents. That was the case in 2011, when Romney wasn't so strong as to be unbeatable, but he was strong enough to discourage the strongest Republicans from running in a year when--given an incumbent president--the odds weren't especially in the GOP's favor. Bush has tens of millions of dollars, but he hasn't begun to shut out the competition. Despite his frantic fundraising, three candidates have officially joined the race--Sens. Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Marco Rubio--and another, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, is building strength and support before he makes an announcement. More importantly, both Rubio and Walker are serious alternatives to Bush; they occupy important parts of the Republican establishment and are acceptable to most party factions. They don't have as much money as Bush, but arguably, their odds are just as good. Other than Romney--who briefly floated a third run for the nomination--Bush's fundraising has done little to dissuade anyone from joining the race. Yes, it is too early for anyone to drop out, but if Jeb were as intimidating as his money suggests, others may have stayed away from the contest entirely. As it stands, the opposite is true. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio is flirting with a campaign--speaking to audiences in New Hampshire, touting his Ohio accomplishments, and talking about what he might do as president--as is Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, who played the same coy game with an influential group of Jewish Republicans, including Sheldon Adelson, in Nevada. In fact, if you count everyone who has either declared or expressed interest, the Republican field is 18 deep, not including Bush: Walker, Rubio, Kasich, Snyder, Paul, Cruz, Mike Huckabee, Ben Carson, Rick Santorum, Chris Christie, Rick Perry, Bobby Jindal, Lindsey Graham, Carly Fiorina, Peter King, George Pataki, Jim Gilmore, and John Bolton. And while it may narrow a little when the primaries officially begin, this is roughly what the slate will look like. There are more candidates now then there were when Jeb announced his ""shock and awe"" fundraising offensive at the beginning of the year, which is to say that Bush has neither shocked nor awed his competition. Despite his fame and name recognition, he's not a titan like his brother or a leviathan like the present-day Hillary Clinton, or even a minor member of the political pantheon like Clinton in 2007; instead, he's one hopeful among many. And while he has loads of cash, his chances aren't appreciably better than his competitors'. Indeed, they're probably worse: If Jeb stands out from the pack, it's because he's a Bush. And the Bush name is unpopular. Dismally, terribly unpopular."	Jeb Bush Says He's Breaking Fundraising Records. So Why Doesn't That Scare Anyone?

He was key to the 2012 Democratic National Convention--almost overshadowing President Obama with a forceful defense of liberal governance--and stumped for candidates throughout the 2014 election cycle. Last year, when asked to rate living former presidents, 64 percent of Americans said they had a favorable view of Clinton, compared with 63 percent for the elder George Bush, 53 percent for George W. Bush, and 52 percent for Jimmy Carter. In a Hillary Clinton campaign--not to mention a Hillary Clinton administration--her husband is a tremendous asset, someone who could help make the difference in a close election, or give valuable advice to a first-term president. But there's a cost to flying with Bill Clinton; you also have to carry his baggage. In 2008 this meant his questionable advisers and his remarks about a certain Illinois senator, including several--""This whole thing is the biggest fairy tale I've ever seen"" and ""Jesse Jackson won South Carolina in '84 and '88. Jackson ran a good campaign. And Obama ran a good campaign here.""--that backfired and let Sen. Barack Obama build the lead with black voters that would help him win the nomination. This time, it means the Clinton Foundation. The foundation's official name is the Bill, Hillary, & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. But originally it was the William J. Clinton Foundation, a project of Bill far more than Hillary, who had focused on her national political career. It was his fame, reputation, and powers of persuasion that drove the effort, which has raised and spent hundreds of millions of dollars on charitable activities around the world, from subsidizing HIV/AIDS drugs (and negotiating lower prices) to improving rural health care in developing countries and tackling climate change. But while Clinton and his foundation have done tremendous good, they have also had a questionable relationship with donors and contributors. On Monday, New York Times reporter Amy Chozick wrote that the paper would be pursuing stories drawn from Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich, a forthcoming book from conservative writer Peter Schweizer. And on Thursday the Times published its first take on Schweizer's material: a long report on a Canadian uranium company whose principals gave huge sums to the Clinton Foundation while the State Department evaluated a deal to sell the company to a Russian energy firm. Overall, the foundation took millions of dollars from seven foreign governments while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, breaking a deal with the White House to disentangle the foundation from foreign donors. There's also this, reported by Reuters: ""Hillary Clinton's family's charities are refiling at least five annual tax returns after a Reuters review found errors in how they reported donations from governments, and said they may audit other Clinton Foundation returns in case of other errors."" With that said, there's no evidence of wrongdoing or illegal behavior. Hillary Clinton wasn't involved in the review of the sale--which involved the State Department as well as eight other agencies--and the main donor, Frank Giustra, sold his stake in the business in 2007, long before anyone had any sense of Hillary Clinton's political future. But while there's no smoking gun, it's hard to escape the sense that the Clintons are following their old pattern: walking to the edge of the ethical line, and probably not crossing it. That's even truer given the relationship among the foundation, its funders, and the Clintons' personal wealth. ""Bill Clinton was paid at least $26 million in speaking fees by companies and organizations that are also major donors to the foundation he created after leaving the White House,"" writes the Washington Post in an analysis of public records and foundation data. Specifically, the former president was paid more than $100 million for speeches between 2001 and 2013. And of the 420 organizations that paid Clinton to speak, 67 were also foundation donors that gave at least $10,000, including major financial firms like Goldman Sachs, Barclays Capital, Deutsche Bank, and Citigroup, who have put millions in foundation coffers as well as the Clinton family bank account. To an extent, this is defensible. Not only is it unsurprising that the same people and groups who give big donations to the Clinton Foundation would also pay a large fee to hear the president speak, but it's also in the foundation's interest as a charity to blur the lines; through speaking, Clinton can encourage listeners to make their own donations, and often these speaking events already require big pledges from participants. To a large degree, this is just how the world of the hyper-wealthy works. It's unseemly, and as Jonathan Chait writes for New York magazine, it looks ""greedy."" Hillary Clinton chose to join this world. No, she couldn't completely distance herself from her husband. But as a senator, a presidential candidate, and secretary of state, she had a separate career. She could have kept that separation in her time after the State Department, declining a role at the Clinton Foundation and keeping institutional distance from her husband. (She should have also worked to minimize any appearance of impropriety, but that's a different story). Coming out of the Obama administration, she had built a strong, independent brand that withstood criticism and scandal. By joining with the foundation--and taking on its liabilities as well as its advantages--Clinton has squandered some of that reputation, in exchange for heightened scrutiny and the appearance of bad behavior. Ahead of a second presidential campaign, the best thing Hillary Clinton could have done is keep Bill Clinton at arm's length. He could campaign for her and fundraise for her, but she wouldn't touch his projects or his priorities. With their long partnership--to say nothing of their marriage--this would have been hard. But if Hillary was serious about avoiding the problems and mistakes of her first campaign, it would have been necessary. As it stands, we're looking at a mixed bag. Has Hillary Clinton avoided the bad advisers--and worst advice--of the past? It seems like it. Is she still carrying her husband's baggage? Absolutely.

12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/04/the_fight_for_15_it_s_a_bad_idea_raising_the_minimum_wage_to_15_would_hurt.html	"The ""Fight for 15"" is just getting started. Last week, protesters gathered in cities across the country to demand a $15 hourly minimum wage, and at least some national politicians are heeding their call. Martin O'Malley, the former governor of Maryland who is positioning himself as Hillary Clinton's liberal rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, endorsed a $15 minimum wage, and it's all but certain that other Democrats will soon follow. So might a handful of Republicans looking to demonstrate that they too care about stagnant incomes for low-wage workers. Minimum wage ballot initiatives passed by substantial margins in four Republican-leaning states in November, and GOP Senate candidates Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Dan Sullivan of Alaska came out in favor of state (but not federal) minimum wage hikes. None of this should come as a shock. Public support for a minimum wage hike is overwhelming. One recent survey, sponsored by the National Employment Law Project, found that 63 percent of Americans favor increasing the minimum wage to $15 over the next five years, and that a more modest increase to $12.50 is backed by 75 percent of Americans, including 53 percent of Republicans. Opposing a minimum wage increase could be hazardous to your political health, and my guess is that opponents will prefer to dodge the issue than to engage it head on. Why beat your head against the wall when you can just go with the flow and embrace a very popular idea? I can think of only one good reason: that increasing the minimum wage so dramatically will damage the economic prospects of millions of vulnerable people. My view is that the labor market is changing in ways that make huge minimum wage hikes, like the one backed by the Fight for 15 movement, very dangerous. First, let me stipulate that there is a lively, ongoing debate among serious, thoughtful people about the wisdom of more modest increases in the federal minimum wage. For years, scholars have been drawing on variation in minimum wage levels across states to determine whether minimum wage hikes reduce employment levels. Can we discern the effects of a minimum wage hike by, say, comparing two neighboring counties, one in which the minimum wage increased and the other in which it did not? Can we screen out all of the nonrandom differences between states and cities that might influence their local minimum wage laws? I'm skeptical, but many scholars, like University of Massachusetts-Amherst economist Arindrajit Dube, have tried to do just that. Dube and his collaborators have concluded that modest minimum wage hikes don't appear to reduce employment levels. Other economists, like David Neumark and William Wascher, disagree. But let's say that Dube is right about modest minimum wage hikes. Does that settle the issue? Should we all join the Fight for 15? Not quite. There is a big difference between raising the federal minimum wage from its current $7.25 to $10.10 versus raising it to $15. (If you don't believe me, just ask Thomas Piketty.) By definition, the federal minimum wage applies across the country, despite the fact that average wages and price levels vary considerably from place to place. One scholar who has been particularly thoughtful as to why this matters is Dube himself, who has argued against a one-size-fits-all approach to the minimum wage. In a paper for the Hamilton Project, Dube observed that ""states as dissimilar as Massachusetts and Mississippi have different capacities to absorb a minimum wage of, say, $11.00 per hour, and a single minimum wage has to balance the needs of states at both ends of the spectrum."" What does it mean for different states to have different capacities to absorb a higher minimum wage? Consider the contrast between Massachusetts, a high-cost, high-wage jurisdiction, and Mississippi, a low-cost, low-wage one. In Massachusetts, very few workers would be affected by an increase in the federal minimum wage to $10.10, as the Bay State already has a $9 minimum wage that is set to increase to $11 by 2017. But in Mississippi, as many as 28 percent of workers would be affected. In Massachusetts, wages are higher, and so are prices. Relatively few employers will have to spend substantially more on their workforce under a higher federal minimum wage, and relatively few will have to raise their prices to account for it. In Mississippi, by contrast, many employers will have to raise their wages, and it's a safe bet that virtually all of the cost of this minimum wage hike will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. You might think that, well, this isn't a huge deal if it's rich people who are paying these higher prices. But of course it will often be poor people who pay them, particularly in a poor state like Mississippi. This makes poor consumers worse off in a direct sense, in that they can purchase less with their earnings. And if consumers are at all sensitive to prices, at least some of them will choose to spend less on labor-intensive goods and services now that they are more expensive. That could reduce the number of minimum wage jobs available. That is why Dube recommends that state and local governments set minimum wages that take into account local wages and local price levels. Specifically, he advocates setting a minimum wage at half of the median full-time wage in a given jurisdiction, a standard that would have yielded minimum wages ranging from $12.45 in Massachusetts to $7.97 in Mississippi. Suffice it to say, there is a great deal of distance between $7.97 and $15. It could be that Dube is a right-wing agitator and friend of the plutocracy who can't be trusted. I tend to think he's a sober, cautious scholar who recognizes that raising the minimum wage involves tradeoffs. The truth is that I go further than Dube. One reason is that I'm not sure looking at short-run employment effects is the right way to understand the impact of the minimum wage. When gas prices start to climb, consumers don't respond immediately by replacing their gas-guzzlers with more fuel-efficient vehicles. They drive a bit less, depending on how high prices have gone and how much control they have over their commutes. But it takes them a bit longer to replace the cars they drive. What actually happens is that consumers scrap their gas-guzzlers faster than they would have otherwise, and when they do replace their cars, they replace them with more fuel-efficient models. Could there be a similar lag when it comes to the minimum wage? It could take time for low-wage employers to develop business models that allow them to get away with fewer less-skilled employees, meaning that we don't see the full effect of a hike right away. The economist Isaac Sorkin has made a compelling case that to really understand the impact of minimum wage laws, we need to have a much better understanding of these long-run effects. But even if we completely ignore the possibility that firms will learn to economize on less-skilled labor, $15 an hour is a bridge too far. My deeper concern is that people who in decades past might have had a fighting chance at making their way into the middle class are now finding it hard to get on the bottom rungs of the job ladder. This matters because low-wage employers aren't just employers. They're also institutions that invest in the human capital of their workforces. Some people learn the basics of what it takes to get and to keep a job (the ability to exercise self-control, to be persistent, to show up on time, to get along with others, to speak the language of your workplace reasonably well) from their parents. Formal education also helps, but not everyone flourishes in formal education. Even the most heroic and dedicated public school teachers can only do so much to close the gap between kids from stable, supportive families and kids from fragile ones. Low-wage employers take on the challenge of succeeding where families and schools have failed. They don't do this because they're saints. They take on this challenge when they have no choice--they'd much prefer to hire workers who are already fully qualified to take on demanding jobs than to nurture talent in-house. What happens when they do have a choice? Firms are losing interest in financing the training of their employees. Peter Cappelli, director of Wharton's Center for Human Resources, notes that although ""employers in the postwar era typically selected employees for general abilities at entry-level positions, then trained them over a lifetime to meet the employers' needs,"" things have changed. Though employers don't generally say this outright, the new expectation is that ""job candidates' skills, which are either adequate or not, are supposed to arrive with the applicants."" There are many theories as to why this has happened. One obvious possibility is that firms have grown less willing to train workers in-house as skilled employees have grown more footloose, and they are reluctant to spend time and resources training workers who will eventually wind up at other firms. Where does this leave job candidates who don't arrive readymade, with all the skills they need to climb the corporate ladder thanks to Mom, Dad, and good old Selective U.? It leaves them in a really tough place. Employers will give these employees a shot only if it's not too expensive for them to do so. As the wage floor rises, why wouldn't employers hire more experienced workers or workers with fewer personal challenges, who need less hand-holding in their first months on the job? A higher minimum wage could be good news for people who are willing to work at today's minimum wage. Yet it might also draw in, say, candidates from more affluent backgrounds who will now compete for the same jobs. Then, of course, there is the possibility that employers will hire fewer, better-skilled employees and augment their pricier labor with machines. This doesn't strike me as a good time to decide that jobs paying less than $15 an hour should literally be against the law. There are millions of people--struggling teenagers, less-skilled immigrants, people who've been unemployed for years, ex-offenders who are trying to get on their feet--who need on-the-job experience if they're ever going to be in positions to command higher wages down the road. Let's increase wage subsidies for low-wage workers. Let's expand apprenticeship programs. Let's try all kinds of things, like celebrating employers that successfully upgrade the skills of their low-wage workers and not just the Googles of the world, which hire only the high-skilled and expect to get patted on the back for it. But let's not lock millions of people out of entry-level employment by raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour."	Raising the Minimum Wage to $15 Would Hurt Millions of Vulnerable People
13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/04/bloomberg_poll_on_republican_support_for_israel_over_america_isn_t_anti.html	"Last week, Bloomberg Politics released a survey of American attitudes toward Israel. The poll, according to Bloomberg, found a ""deep partisan split."" Two-thirds of Republicans said they were more sympathetic to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu than to President Obama. When Republicans were asked about U.S.-Israel relations, 30 percent favored this statement: ""Israel is an ally but we should pursue America's interests when we disagree with them."" Sixty-seven percent supported this option instead: ""Israel is an important ally, the only democracy in the region, and we should support it even if our interests diverge."" Some readers of the poll, including me, interpreted it as a sign that many Republicans identify more with Israel than with the United States. Others rejected this interpretation as implicit anti-Semitic McCarthyism. The poll itself has been dismissed as a con job: ""deceptive,"" ""garbage,"" and ""irresponsible."" Critics say the question about Israeli and American interests was rigged and misleading. From the critics' standpoint, it would be convenient if those of us who take the poll seriously were Jew haters, enemies of Israel, or knee-jerk leftists defending an imperial Obama presidency. It would be even more convenient if the poll stood alone. But it doesn't. Surveys by Gallup, the Pew Research Center, and ABC News and the Washington Post have yielded similar results. And the best recent survey on attitudes toward Israel, released four months ago by the Brookings Institution, backs up Bloomberg's poll. It shows that Republicans are closely divided between U.S. and Israeli interests, that many of them are driven by religious devotion, and that they prefer Israeli annexation or indefinite occupation of the territories, with restricted rights for Palestinians, to an integrated democracy. The poll, taken by GfK and designed by Dr. Shibley Telhami of the University of Maryland, asked more than 1,000 Americans how important the Israeli-Palestinian issue was to each of them. Thirty-seven percent of Republicans said it was one of their top five issues. These high-intensity respondents are the people most likely to vote, donate money, or mobilize friends based on this issue. For Republican politicians, they're a prized constituency. That gives them considerable influence within the party. I asked Telhami and his research assistant, Katayoun Kishi, to break down the poll's data not just by party (which they've done in a series of slides for Brookings) but also for this high-intensity segment of polled respondents. The results, shown here in a series of graphs, expose profound differences. Start with the question of Israeli settlements in the territories. The poll asked: ""Do you think it is all right for Israel to build settlements in these territories, or do you think they should not?"" Sixty-three percent of all respondents said Israel shouldn't build settlements; only 34 percent said it was OK. Republicans were more closely divided: 51 percent opposed settlement construction, but 46 percent said it was OK. Among high-intensity Republicans, the consensus was reversed. Sixty-six percent said settlements were OK; only 31 percent disagreed. Defenders of the settlements, led by Netanyahu, argue that Israel's construction in the territories isn't really land seizure, since Israel will trade away other tracts in order to keep the settlements when it recognizes a Palestinian state. But Netanyahu undercut that argument last month by declaring that a Palestinian state would not be established during his term. His pledge defied the plurality of Americans who, according to Telhami's poll, favor a two-state solution. But so what? The pledge secured Netanyahu's re-election in Israel, and it plays well with his American constituency. As the poll demonstrates, a plurality of high-intensity Republicans favors occupation, not statehood. The poll offered respondents four options and asked them which one the United States should support. One option was ""a two-state solution: Israel and a Palestinian state side by side. The Palestinian state would be established on the territories that Israel has occupied since 1967."" Another option was ""a one-state solution: A single democratic state in which both Jews and Arabs are full and equal citizens, covering all of what is now Israel and the Palestinian Territories."" A third option was ""annexation without equal citizenship: Israel would annex the Palestinian territories, but keep a majority-Jewish state in the expanded territories by restricting citizenship rights of Palestinians."" A fourth option was to ""maintain occupation of both the territories Israel has captured in 1967 and the Palestinians inhabiting them indefinitely."" Thirty-nine percent of the overall sample favored a two-state solution. Thirty-four percent preferred a one-state solution. Fourteen percent chose indefinite occupation, and 8 percent chose annexation. Republicans were more evenly divided, but the top preference was still a two-state solution, with 33 percent support. Among high-intensity Republicans, the order of preference went the other way. A two-state solution was the least favored option, with 20 percent support. Twenty-six percent chose a one-state solution. Twenty-three percent preferred annexation, and 27 percent preferred indefinite occupation. That's a 50 percent plurality for occupation or annexation, with explicit restrictions on the rights of Palestinians, rather than for Palestinian autonomy or equal citizenship. When the two-state option is removed, the plurality becomes a clear majority. And that scenario is what's now unfolding. As Israel builds settlements and rules out a Palestinian state in the foreseeable future, the prospect of a two-state solution is fading. For this reason, respondents who initially favored the two-state option were asked which other option they preferred if a two-state solution became impossible. When these people were redistributed to their second choices, the result was a 60 percent majority for a one-state solution. Among high-intensity Republicans, the balance went the other way: 63 percent chose occupation or annexation, while 32 percent chose a one-state solution. Even among Republicans as a whole, a majority--53 percent to 44 percent--preferred occupation or annexation to an integrated democratic state. Critics of the Bloomberg poll say its question about Israeli interests was biased because it mentioned that Israel is a democracy. They think this word tugged respondents toward the pro-Israel answer. Netanyahu makes the same argument, that Americans support Israel because it's democratic. But when Telhami's poll tested the importance of that factor--pointing out that in the absence of a two-state solution, we might have to choose between a Jewish-controlled Israel and a democratic Israel--high-intensity Republicans didn't choose democracy. They chose Judaism. The poll asked this question: ""Which of the following statements is closer to your view if a two-state solution is not an option?"" One option was: ""I favor Israel's democracy more than its Jewishness. I support a single democratic state in which Arabs and Jews are equal."" The other option was: ""I favor the Jewishness of Israel more than its democracy. I support the continuation of Israel's Jewish majority even if it means that Palestinians will not have citizenship and full rights."" Seventy-one percent of respondents chose democracy; 24 percent chose Jewish control. Among Republicans, the gap was narrower, but 60 percent still chose democracy. High-intensity Republicans, however, tilted the other way. They chose Jewish control, 55 percent to 41 percent. This religious commitment doesn't just override regard for democracy and equal rights. For many people, it also overrides American interests. Thirty-one percent of all respondents, 51 percent of Republicans, and 72 percent of high-intensity Republicans said that in mediating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the United States should lean toward Israel. The poll asked them why. It offered three possible reasons. One answer was that ""Israel and the U.S. have shared values."" Another answer was that ""supporting Israel serves the interests of the United States."" The third answer was that ""it's my religious or ethnic duty to support Israel."" Among all respondents who were asked this question, 21 percent said it was their religious or ethnic duty. Among Republicans, the percentage who gave that answer was 27 percent. Among high-intensity Republicans, it was 36 percent. That's substantially more than the 24 percent who cited shared values, and almost as many as the 38 percent who cited shared national interests. This is an uncomfortable subject. To many of us, it feels anti-Semitic to raise questions about religious motives, ethnic duty, Jewish control, or divided loyalty. That's the implicit message in allusions, by some critics of the Bloomberg poll, to ""slurs"" and ""tropes."" But Telhami's survey indicates that religious devotion to Israel isn't primarily a Jewish thing. It's a Christian thing. Among respondents who described themselves as born-again or evangelical Christians, a 38 percent plurality cited religious or ethnic duty, rather than shared national values or interests, as their reason for siding with Israel. Among Jews, religious or ethnic duty was the least cited reason, at 24 percent. What particularly galls conservatives is the dual-loyalty question. They say the statement affirmed by two-thirds of Republicans in the Bloomberg poll--that ""we should support [Israel] even if our interests diverge""--doesn't necessarily put Israeli interests before American interests. That's true. But it leaves open the question: How many Republicans truly care more about Israel than about the United States? If the number isn't 67 percent, what is it? Telhami's poll suggests an answer. He posed the question in a different way, by asking respondents to choose from six perspectives on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. One was: ""I am not concerned about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict."" Another was: ""I am mostly concerned about protecting human rights."" A third was: ""I am mostly concerned about maintaining international law."" The remaining options were ""I am mostly concerned about the consequences for American interests,"" ""I am mostly concerned about the Palestinian interests,"" and ""I am mostly concerned about Israeli interests."" Among all respondents, the top answer was human rights, at 31 percent. Twenty-four percent cited American interests, and 14 percent cited Israeli interests. Among Republicans, American interests came in first, at 29 percent. But it was nearly eclipsed by Israeli interests, at 26 percent. Among high-intensity Republicans, the top answer, by a runaway margin, was Israeli interests. Forty-eight percent said they were ""mostly concerned about Israeli interests."" Only 29 percent said they were ""mostly concerned about the consequences for American interests."" So here's a summary of what the poll conveys. When Republicans are asked to pick from a range of guiding principles, almost as many choose Israeli interests as U.S. interests. Most Republicans, in the absence of a two-state solution, prefer Israeli control of Palestinians, through occupation or annexation, to a single integrated country with equal rights. Thirty-seven percent of Republicans consider Israel one of their top five issues, and most of these people would abandon democracy in order to make sure Israel remains a Jewish-controlled religious state. By a wide margin, this segment of the GOP cares more about Israeli interests than about American interests, human rights, or any other principle. That's not McCarthyism or anti-Semitism. It's reality. And it raises hard questions about what the Republican Party stands for."	The Bloomberg Poll on GOP Support for Israel Isn't Anti-Semitic

15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/05/how_to_fix_baltimore_lower_its_property_taxes.html	"Can Baltimore and cities like it ever become good places to raise children? In the days since Freddie Gray's death, there has been a great deal of discussion of police brutality, and for good reason. Yet there have also been questions about why large swaths of Baltimore are so persistently poor, and why children who grow up in the city's poorest neighborhoods grow up to be poor themselves. The Harvard economists Raj Chetty and Nathaniel Hendren have recently released a study that finds that poor children raised in Baltimore City earn $4,510 less per year as adults than poor children raised in an average U.S. county. Are Baltimore's public schools unusually bad? Or is it that Baltimore's low-income families don't get the help they need from the government, while those living in the suburbs do? Is there something uniquely destructive about the culture that prevails in these communities that fades once families move just a few miles away? I'm sure there's at least something to each of these explanations, but there is another problem that deserves consideration: Baltimore's high property taxes are keeping the city poor. That's right. If you want to make Baltimore more livable for poor children, cutting property taxes could be the best bet. To understand why Baltimore's property taxes might matter, it is first important to understand the mounting evidence that poor children benefit from growing up in non-poor neighborhoods. Chetty, Hendren, and their colleague Lawrence Katz draw on the Moving to Opportunity, or MTO, experiment, an ambitious effort to gauge the effects of neighborhood environment on long-term life outcomes for poor children. The experiment was designed to gauge whether moving families from a high-poverty neighborhood to a low-poverty neighborhood yielded significant gains for children over the long term, and the answer appears to be yes. Children from families that moved to low-poverty neighborhoods earned 31 percent more than those from families in the control group, who remained in their high-poverty neighborhoods. If these findings aren't reason enough to be concerned about the effects of being raised in a high-poverty neighborhood, the NYU sociologist Patrick Sharkey, author of Stuck in Place, has found evidence that these negative effects can be transmitted from one generation to the next. In other words, when we do nothing about the concentration of poverty in a given neighborhood, we're not just damaging the lives of the children who live there today--we're damaging the lives of their children. We can't say definitively why this is the case, but one plausible explanation is that when poor kids interact with kids from better-off families, they're in a much better position to learn about opportunities for advancement and to take advantage of them, and these effects build from generation to generation. So what does all this have to do with property taxes, you ask? If our goal is to reduce the concentration of poverty in the worst-off neighborhoods, and to encourage the kind of class-mixing that might better the lives of poor children, we can either give poor families the resources to move out or convince better-off families to move in. Moving poor families out doesn't require property tax cuts. Convincing better-off families to move in probably does. To pursue the move-out strategy, we could use MTO-style housing vouchers to help children escape to better-off neighborhoods. But of course we can't force families to leave these neighborhoods, to which many residents are strongly attached. To do so would be illiberal in the extreme. Moreover, given the sheer number of families living in high-poverty neighborhoods in Baltimore, there might be some practical limit to this strategy. The MTO experiment tracked roughly 4,600 families in five U.S. cities. It's not at all clear that an MTO-style approach would work if we scaled it up to, say, 40,000 families in one city. Transforming poor neighborhoods into mixed-income ones isn't easy either. Once the process takes hold, however, it can gain strength over time. Because middle-income families tend to have stronger social networks, they're in a better position to fight for improvements in local schools and better policing. The question is how to get this process started. At a bare minimum, cities like Baltimore have to ensure that families (and businesses) that choose to invest in the city will earn a decent return on that investment. In his 2014 book Boom Towns, Stephen J.K. Walters, an economist at Loyola University Maryland, tells the fascinating story of Boston in the first decades of the 20th century, when a charismatic Irish American mayor, James Michael Curley, built a powerful political machine in part by hiking property taxes. High property taxes financed a big expansion in the number of public employees, virtually all of whom were politically loyal to Curley. They also drove out Curley's political enemies, the affluent Boston Brahmins who resented having to pay higher taxes. Because Boston's higher taxes didn't finance better public services--if anything, the quality of public services deteriorated over time--the Brahmins decamped for Boston's suburbs, where the same investment in property would yield much higher after-tax returns. This wasn't the only reason Boston's old-line WASPs were rushing for the exits, to be sure, but Walters argues persuasively that it was a big part of it, and he points to the fact that similar cities that had much lower per capita property tax burdens in that era saw their populations grow, not shrink. You could say that Boston was experiencing ""white flight,"" only Boston's better-off families were fleeing other white people. Eventually, Boston recovered. Since the early 1980s, Boston has seen an extraordinary revival as upwardly mobile families have flocked to buy and restore many of its handsome old houses. Indeed, Boston's biggest problem is arguably that it's become so attractive to affluent families that many low-income families are getting priced out. So what changed? For Walters, it is no coincidence that Boston's property boom followed a statewide cap on property taxes that went into effect in 1982. Homeowners no longer feared that their property taxes would increase without limit, so more and more of them were willing to invest. While Boston lost 30 percent of its residents between 1950 and 1980, it gained 5 percent over the next two decades and the median household income in the city increased 38 percent faster than the national average from 1979 to 2005. The result is a city that is hardly a utopia yet has a far healthier mix of rich and poor than cities like Baltimore. Chetty and Hendren find that poor children raised in Suffolk County, Massachusetts, which is dominated by Boston, earn $840 less than the U.S. average as adults, or $3,670 more than their counterparts in Baltimore. When the Massachusetts property tax cap was being debated, many feared that cities like Boston would be starved of revenue as services collapsed. Instead, a rush of new investment and economic activity led to healthy increases in property tax revenues. I'm not a reflexive supply-sider who believes that tax cuts always pay for themselves. I can definitely see the case for, say, raising federal income taxes on high earners to reduce the deficit or to increase anti-poverty spending. Local property taxes are different, as it is much easier to move from one town to another than it is to move from one country to another. Furthermore, high property taxes have a number of perverse effects. If my property taxes go up and my services improve by a commensurate amount, I'm in good shape. But if my property taxes go up and local services, like policing and public schooling, actually get worse, the value of my home will go down relative to a similar home in a more lightly taxed jurisdiction. By the same token, higher property taxes reduce the after-tax return I get from investing in the upkeep of my home. That's one reason why about a quarter of the homes in Sandtown-Winchester, one of Baltimore's economically depressed neighborhoods, are abandoned. Similar homes just a mile or two away are kept in perfectly good shape in Baltimore County, where property taxes are roughly half as high as they are in the city proper. (Remember that I'm saying property taxes are part of the story. There are many reasons why one neighborhood might be in better shape than another. The point is that high property taxes stack the deck against those who want to make investments in fixed property.) Even more egregious is the effect of property taxes on business investment. The great advantage of cities over smaller communities is that cities are essentially big accumulations of capital. Workers in Boston earn more than similarly educated and motivated workers in rural Massachusetts because they're surrounded by other workers from whom they can learn over time but also because they have access to lots of useful stuff, like office buildings filled with desks and computers and warehouses with forklifts and cranes. If you raise taxes on useful stuff, which is to say capital goods, too high, however, business owners will start spending money on capital goods in other jurisdictions, where they can get a better return. Think about the effect this has on a city like Baltimore, which has large numbers of less skilled workers. If these workers had access to capital goods, they would produce more and they would command higher wages. But because Baltimore's high property taxes discourage capital investment, their productivity levels remain low and so do the wages employers are willing to pay them. In ""How to Make Baltimore a Superstar City,"" a 2010 essay published in the Maryland Journal, Walters and his co-author, Louis Miserendino, offer a plan of action for Baltimore. They call for revising the city's charter to guarantee that property taxes would be cut three years in the future to a level just below that of suburban Baltimore County, and for raising property taxes only with a supermajority popular vote. Since Walters and Miserendino anticipate that property values would immediately rise, and that investors would flock to the city in large numbers, they call for reserving higher-than-inflation increases in tax receipts to a ""lock box"" that would be drawn upon once the property tax cut went into effect, to provide a cushion against any short-term revenue shortfall. Over time, if Walters and Miserendino were right, Baltimore would grow far more attractive to middle-income families and to businesses looking to make significant capital investments. Baltimore's workers would be better off, as they'd have more capital to work with, and its poor families would be less isolated as high-poverty neighborhoods slowly became mixed-income neighborhoods. Keep in mind that Baltimore's city government already uses property tax cuts to attract investment. The problem is that they do so selectively by extending tax breaks to politically connected developers for projects that tend to be built downtown. Walters and Miserendino's approach offers the same favorable tax treatment to all investors, whether they're families looking to buy a home or large-scale developers. Cutting property taxes is far from the only thing Baltimore needs. Higher-quality public services would do a great deal of good--particularly better policing. MTO-like programs that help poor families move to better-off communities in the suburbs or beyond are worth investing in too. Yet if Baltimore is to have a future, it must become a place that attracts rather than repels investment, and lower property taxes are an excellent way to achieve that goal."

Washington, he said in his video announcement, ""has done enough lying and stealing. I'll never rob seniors of what our government has promised them and even forced them to pay for."" He hit this note again in his first campaign speech, with a few shots at his GOP competitors for good measure. ""There are some who propose that to save the safety nets like Medicare and Social Security, we ought to chop off the payments for the people who have faithfully had their paychecks and pockets picked by the politician, promising them that their money would be waiting for them when they were old and sick,"" said Huckabee. ""My friend, you were forced to pay for Social Security and Medicare. For 50 years, the government grabs the money from our paychecks and says it'll be waiting for us when we turn 65. If Congress wants to take away someone's retirement, let them end their own congressional pensions, not your Social Security."" What Huckabee understands--and what makes him a serious presence in the GOP field--is that many Republican voters, even those on the right, aren't opposed to generous government spending on individuals. Disproportionately older or elderly, they're strong supporters of Social Security and Medicare, which they see as earned benefits. Instead, they're opposed to spending on people perceived as undeserving. Texas Gov. Rick Perry discovered this the hard way in the 2012 primary, when he blasted Social Security as a ""Ponzi scheme.""

17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/05/hillary_clinton_s_immigration_gamble_the_democratic_frontrunner_just_went.html	"For the second time in two weeks, Hillary Clinton has surprised progressives. Last week, in the aftermath of rioting in Baltimore, she gave a strong speech on criminal justice reform, endorsing body cameras and police reform, and calling for an end to mass incarceration. On Tuesday, speaking to a group of DREAMers--unauthorized kids brought to the country as children--at a Nevada high school, she gave the same full-throated support to comprehensive immigration reform, going beyond President Obama--and activist expectations--to endorse changes to the immigration detention system, a path to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants, protections for children brought to the country illegally, and an expansion of the president's executive order, meant to keep millions of unauthorized immigrants from deportation and give millions more the right to apply for work permits and other documentation. ""The American people support comprehensive immigration reform not just because it's the right thing to do,"" Clinton said during the roundtable meeting, ""but because it will strengthen families, strengthen our economy, and strengthen our country. That's why we can't wait any longer, we can't wait any longer for a path to full and equal citizenship."" This is a line in the sand. Hillary Clinton is for expansive immigration reform. And the implications--in policy and in politics--are huge. First is the policy. Unlike Obama, who excluded large groups of unauthorized immigrants from his deferred action programs, Clinton wants to ""do everything possible under the law to go even further"" for large groups of people, including ""many parents of DREAMers and others with deep ties and contributions to our communities."" Whether it's possible is unclear; according to Obama's Office of Legal Counsel, it's illegal.* At the same time, such a move might fall within the ""broad discretion"" enjoyed by the executive branch on matters of immigration. Either way, it would mark a substantial change from the status quo. Clinton also wants to reduce the number of vulnerable people in detention facilities, including children, LGBT individuals, and the elderly. ""I'm very worried about detention, and detention facilities for people who are vulnerable and for children that I think we could do a better job if we kept attention to the people who have a record of violent, illegal behavior and that we have a different approach toward people who are not in that category,"" she said. In practice, this means something like a probation system to ensure that immigrants appear at their court dates, and other alternatives to incarceration to protect people from sexual assault--an acute problem for LGBT immigrant detainees--and solitary confinement. Second is the politics as it relates to Democrats. Clinton is already well-positioned with Latino voters. By tacking to the left of the president--and essentially giving immigration activists their core demands--she moves closer to rebuilding the coalition that elected Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. As BuzzFeed declares, the Democratic presidential candidate has ""won over much of the skeptical immigrant activist movement."" It's hard to say how much this means for actual votes, but it's significant. Latinos represent the majority of the net increase in eligible voters between 2012 and 2016. And in swing states like Colorado, Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, and Virginia, Latino voting populations have grown while white ones have declined. A stronger immigration stance doesn't deliver Florida necessarily, but it might make it an easier reach. Which leads us, finally, to how this relates to Republicans. According to the latest poll from NBC News and the Wall Street Journal, she leads both Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio with 66 and 63 percent support among Latinos versus 28 and 32 percent support, respectively. This isn't far from Obama's performance versus McCain in 2008 (67 percent to 31 percent) and Romney in 2012 (71 percent to 27 percent). The difference is that Bush and Rubio have a shot at improving the GOP's position; they support some variation on immigration reform--with a strong emphasis on border security--and reject the more callous language of immigration hardliners. They may not reach George W. Bush's success with Latino voters--polarization makes that difficult--but they can avoid the rock bottom of Romney. As long as Democrats hovered near Obama's position, Bush and Rubio could triangulate, offering a modest but serious alternative to Latinos who were dissatisfied with Democrats but didn't want to sign on to a restrictionist agenda. In moving to Obama's left, however, Hillary has changed the game. ""Make no mistake,"" she said during the roundtable, ""Today not a single Republican candidate, announced or potential, is clearly and consistently supporting a path to citizenship. Not one. When they talk about ""legal status,"" that's code for 'second-class status.' "" Now, there's a stark choice, between an expansive agenda of inclusion from the Democrats, and a more limited, hesitant approach from Republicans. Move in her direction, and the two Republican candidates face an angry conservative base. Try to move to the right, and they risk their appeal to Latino voters. It's a tough spot, and they owe Clinton for the trouble. With all of that said, there is a danger Democrats should consider, too. To secure older, whiter states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania--much less win House seats and retake the Senate--Democrats need to improve with the white working class. Can Hillary appeal to working-class whites and embrace immigration reform, or will she spark a small backlash from whites who feel threatened by increased immigration? Will they see her, and Democrats, as indifferent to their concerns? Or does Hillary retain enough goodwill from her past political lives to improve on Obama's performance? If the answer is yes--if Hillary can tout immigration reform and improve with working-class whites--then we won't just see a second President Clinton, we'll also get insight into the last eight years. If it's not policies that hurt Obama with working-class whites, then maybe it's something a little uglier that caused them to back away from the Democratic Party.

18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/05/conservatives_trying_to_unify_gop_presidential_field_why_it_s_hard_for_republicans.html	"The field of announced Republican candidates has recently doubled to six, with the entry of Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, and Mike Huckabee. When you add the candidates who are almost certain to soon join the race--Jeb Bush, Gov. Scott Walker, Rick Perry, and Gov. Chris Christie--and the others who might, the field will be big enough to fill an airport shuttle van. The stage at the first Fox News debate in early August will have so many people on it, the organizers may need to put everyone on bleachers. The Republican presidential pageant is vastly more diverse than the Democratic coronation. The GOP field includes a female CEO, a black surgeon, two Cuban Americans, a lawyer, and a preacher. This all-but-a-candlestick-maker group is the most robust Republican field in history. But while some Republicans celebrate their diversity and strength, some conservatives see it as a challenge. ""If we continue to split the vote, we'll lose to the establishment candidate,"" says Fran Wendelboe, a former seven-term New Hampshire state representative who now heads an effort to consolidate the conservative vote in the Granite State. Named the 603 Alliance, after the state's area code, the group is committed to picking a Republican candidate who shares its members' views about limited government and who promises to be an executive operating within a strict interpretation of the Constitution. The alliance hopes to bring candidates together in an October caucus where members will agree to gather behind one horse. This has been tried before, Wendelboe admits, but ""this time the numbers are on our side. We've tried it time and again with the moderate candidate. We've sacrificed our principles and we still haven't won."" After going down so many wrong roads, she argues, conservatives will see the wisdom of being tactical and coalescing, not simply following their passion. That is exactly the message Sen. Ted Cruz has been selling for months, criticizing the soggy-bread candidates of recent nominees like Sen. John McCain and Mitt Romney. But this is the same message many conservatives have delivered before. Illinois Sen. Everett Dirksen stood up at the 1952 convention and said the party was on the way to committing suicide if it nominated a moderate again and not a true conservative like Robert Taft. ""We've followed you before and you took us down the road to defeat and don't do this to us,"" he said, unleashing pandemonium in the hall. Social conservatives tried this in 2012, when a week before the South Carolina primary, a group of 100 evangelical leaders gathered at a ranch near Houston to put their shoulders behind one candidate to block Mitt Romney's march to the nomination. They backed Rick Santorum, which helped give him an infusion of cash, but ultimately wasn't enough. The challenge with these efforts is that a lot of voters give more weight to a candidate's electability than to a candidate's ideological compatibility. Ideology can get sticky, too. In New Hampshire, the 603 Alliance isn't taking social issues into account when making its decisions about which candidate to unite behind. But there's a separate effort by social conservatives to find their own one true candidate. In mid-May, National Journal reports, the Council on National Policy will hold meetings to vet candidates. It's not certain that these distinct efforts to pick one candidate will settle on the same one. ""Whoever they will pick will be a conservative. Whoever 603 picks, will be a conservative,"" says Wendelboe. ""If their person and our person are in the top three, that is OK. What matters most is that there not be a dozen candidates people will split their votes over."" Bob Vander Plaats, a social conservative leader in Iowa, says the process of uniting is a delicate one. ""The people are as excited as I've ever seen them in the conservative base,"" he said, ""so I'd hate to short-circuit the process."" Vander Plaats' organization, the Family Leader, will hold a series of events this summer to help its members and other social conservatives ""do a thorough job of vetting candidates on their character and competency and the company they keep--who they are putting around them--on cash--do they have the resources to go the distance--and prayer. We pray that God would lead the one that we would be behind."" While the process is playing out, the challenge is keeping the voters and activists from peeling off to support candidates. ""Hopefully there are enough of us not committed by Thanksgiving to say we can get behind a candidate,"" said Vander Plaats. ""If I break early for Huckabee and someone breaks for Santorum and Jindal, we're going to fail by division."" In the end, the greatest challenge to all the efforts to unite behind one candidate is that leaders are asking people of passion to act tactically. That's not only hard for them to do as a matter of personal constitution, but it's exactly the kind of behavior that you'd expect from people who value pragmatism over principle. In other words, moderates."	Why It's So Hard for Conservatives to Rally Around a Single Candidate

Pro-surveillance legislators, including the Senate majority leader, want Congress to reauthorize the provision in its current form. Pro-privacy legislators on both sides of the aisle want Congress to scale the provision back. Unless legislators can agree on far-reaching reforms, the better course is simply to let Section 215 expire. Congress enacted the Patriot Act in October 2001, just weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks. Few legislators read the proposed law before they voted for it. The bill was hundreds of pages long, and it amended statutes that were notoriously complicated. The intelligence community said it needed new authority, and few legislators thought it was the right time to ask questions. But precisely because so few questions were being asked, legislators insisted that some of the Patriot Act's authorities, including Section 215, have ""sunset"" provisions. The point of including these provisions was to ensure that the law would be re-evaluated once its implications--including its civil liberties implications--were better understood and that surveillance authorities whose limits were unclear from the outset wouldn't become permanent unless the government could make a strong case for their necessity. Even in the climate of panic that prevailed in the weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks, Congress wanted the strong presumption to be that the era of Patriot Act surveillance would one day come to an end. The decision to include sunset provisions turns out to have been a prudent one. The Patriot Act has enabled a truly dramatic expansion of the government's surveillance activities--an expansion far greater than even the law's critics predicted. Relying on authority granted by the Patriot Act, the FBI issued hundreds of thousands of ""national security letters,"" each one a demand for sensitive information and each one accompanied by a ""gag order"" prohibiting the recipient from disclosing the letter's existence. It monitored millions of Americans' Internet activities--tracking, among other things, to whom they sent emails and who sent emails to them. It conducted thousands of secret searches of homes, offices, and other premises in the United States--an astounding 6,471 such searches in 2013 alone--the vast majority of them in cases having nothing to do with terrorism. A now-infamous slide disclosed by Edward Snowden is titled ""Collect It All,"" and this chilling slogan supplies an entirely fair characterization of what the government has been trying to do. The call-records program is just another manifestation of the same mindset. Since 2006, the NSA has been using Section 215 to collect Americans' call records en masse. At the close of business each day, the major telecommunications companies provide the NSA with a record of who called whom, when, and for how long. The resulting database is an account of Americans' most sensitive associations--of calls between husbands and wives, doctors and patients, lawyers and clients. The program is an immense intrusion into the privacy of millions of people, but there is no evidence that it has made us more secure. To the contrary, two official review groups have concluded that the program hasn't been crucial in any terrorism investigation. And the president himself has acknowledged that the government can track the phone calls of suspected terrorists without wholesale collection of innocent Americans' call records. Some government officials have suggested that allowing Section 215 to expire would require the government to abandon not just the call-records program but also other investigative activities whose legitimacy no one would question. But the government has never identified these purportedly legitimate activities, even in general terms, and its vague warnings, made for the most part in not-for-attribution statements to the media, are not sufficient to justify the extension of a surveillance power that has already been so grossly abused. Moreover, many of the legitimate things the government can do with Section 215 can be accomplished in other ways--with grand jury subpoenas or with pen registers, for example. Allowing Section 215 to expire wouldn't force the government to stop doing those things; it would simply force the government to use other legal means where it was previously using Section 215. The more compelling argument against allowing Section 215 to sunset comes from those who believe that Congress should leverage the opportunity presented by the scheduled sunset to enact a broad reform package. But while the proposed bill--the USA Freedom Act--includes worthwhile elements, it doesn't go nearly far enough. (The American Civil Liberties Union neither supports nor opposes it.) It would allow the government to continue storing innocent people's records in vast intelligence databases. It would require the government to be more transparent about its use of some surveillance authorities, but it would allow the FBI to keep secret some of the information the public needs most. And while it would end the bulk collection of call records under Section 215, it would leave the government with the authority to engage in the broad collection of other kinds of sensitive records. We appreciate the work of the legislators who are championing the bill--Sens. Patrick Leahy and Ron Wyden and Reps. John Conyers and Jim Sensenbrenner, in particular, deserve credit for their tireless work in the service of surveillance reform--but they have had to make deep concessions to the intelligence community in order to win its support. We can't help but worry that the vague language in the bill's key provisions will provide a new lease on life to surveillance programs that haven't yet been--and may never be--disclosed to the public. We can't afford to squander the opportunity that the scheduled sunset of Section 215 affords. Thanks to Snowden, Americans now know that the government's surveillance activities are far more extensive than is defensible in a free society. The current debate in Congress reflects a growing bipartisan consensus that reform is urgently needed. Unless Congress can coalesce around much broader reforms than are on the table right now, the best way to begin the reform effort is by letting Section 215 expire. Letting the provision die wouldn't itself accomplish all of the changes that are necessary--not even close. But it would be a first step toward the kind of systemic reform we desperately need, and it would send an important and overdue message that the era of unchecked government surveillance--the era of the Patriot Act--is at long last coming to an end."

But other than race, the two men are incomparable. Cain, a businessman and radio host, was a showman--a personality whose flamboyant defense of the Tea Party fueled a quick rise to conservative stardom and whose attacks on President Obama carried a racial comparison. The media, he said during his campaign, ""Are ... scared that a real black man may run against Barack Obama."" Carson is far from exuberant--he speaks in calm, even tones--and joins the political stage after a long career in medicine and as a motivational speaker. A famed pediatric neurosurgeon, Carson is an icon in the black community. His book Gifted Hands--the story of his rise from inner-city Detroit to the pinnacle of his field--made its way to countless black kids in countless black homes. ""Carson is a great American success story,"" writes Joel Anderson for BuzzFeed, ""a rags-to-riches hero who embodied achievement against long odds. His achievement turned him into an icon of black triumph, a Horatio Alger figure in hospital scrubs."" But while his career was made in hospital wards and inner-city schools, his recent fame comes from his address at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast, where he criticized Obamacare and offered his own alternative for health care reform. From there, he became a conservative celebrity, so famous that by the end of the year, supporters had founded a political action committee to draft Carson into the presidential race. Carson's announcement speech was light on substance, but it's clear he doesn't stray far from the rest of the Republican pack. He's opposed to Obamacare, of course; called for an end to social programs that ""create dependency""; and told supporters, ""It's time to rise up and take government back."" With that said, there is one important difference between Carson's rhetoric and that from the rest of the presidential field: It's in the paranoid style. Throughout his speech, Carson made reference to the assorted conspiracies of the far right. People are afraid to speak up, he said, because the ""IRS might audit them."" The government, he continues, just wants you to ""keep your mouth shut."" Likewise, he says, we can't trust unemployment statistics because, he claimed, ""You can make the unemployment rate anything you want it to be."" If you go beyond his presidential announcement to look at his political rhetoric during the past year, you see a similar touch of the paranoid. In one interview, he warned that anarchy from ""this pathway we are going down"" could lead to the 2016 election being called off, as Obama declares ""martial law."" In another, he accused Obama of using immigration to bring in new voters who will be ""dependent on government."" He's compared America under Obama to Nazi Germany, and in a speech at the 2013 Values Voter Summit, he called Obamacare the ""worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery."" It's this paranoid approach to conservative politics that separates Carson from Herman Cain or Allen West or any of the other black Republicans who have come to fame in the Obama era. Indeed, if Carson has fellow travelers, it's conservative provocateurs like Glenn Beck and right-wing politicians like Michele Bachmann or Sarah Palin. Like Carson, their styles are defined by conspiratorial thinking, and like Carson, they largely appeal to the older, whiter, and most conservative voters of the Republican Party. Can Carson turn this paranoia into votes? Probably. If he makes it to the Iowa primaries, he'll almost certainly find support from a portion of the electorate. But there's no chance that he'll go beyond a modest showing with social conservatives to win a contest or even the nomination. At most, he'll harm a more mainstream Republican, like Sen. Ted Cruz, who needs to win as many voters on the right as possible. And after that? The former hero to black Americans will likely fade from view, as another fringe candidate running another vanity campaign. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."

It's true that he occasionally stumbles upon insights, as he does, for example, in his writing on emerging neuroscience. But he is consistently wrong-headed when he takes on issues relating to poverty. His instinct is always to discuss the problem in terms of virtue and morality; material factors and structural conditions are afterthoughts. Thus his columns on the poor end up being something closer to 800-word rants masquerading as high-minded journalism. It's never enough for him to batter you with erudition; he insists on moralizing as well. On Friday, Brooks published another fatuous piece about poverty. This time, naturally, the subject was Baltimore. Brooks tried to undercut the popular trope that funding poor communities like Baltimore will improve conditions.

22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/04/bernie_sanders_running_for_president_helps_hillary_clinton_the_vermont_senator.html	"When candidates are confronted by ideological opposition from within their own party, they face two options: They can fight it or embrace it. In 1952 Dwight Eisenhower and Robert Taft fought. In 1980 Jimmy Carter and Edward Kennedy fought. In 2014 Republican incumbents fearful of Tea Party challengers co-opted the grassroots movement's message and with a suffocating embrace drained their opponents of a rallying cry. In the first act of the Hillary Clinton v. Bernie Sanders competition, the candidates are following the latter route: It's all snuggle. Sen. Sanders announced that he was running for president Thursday and trained his fire on Republicans. He needs attention and he could have gotten it by showing the clear differences between his views and Clinton's--but he didn't. He says he will fight for the middle class (which is also Clinton's message), but he didn't give voice to the liberals who believe that Clinton's ties to Wall Street and big money will prevent her from ever genuinely fighting for the middle class. (He knows they believe this because voters tell him so on the stump.) She calls herself the ""people's champion."" Sanders could have pointed out that he has been the real tribune of working people, but he didn't do that either. When pressed about donations to the Clinton foundation, Sanders said it concerned him before quickly changing the subject to the Koch brothers and how much worse their influence is in politics. That is what Clinton allies do. If this continues to be the Vermont senator's approach, Sanders will be more of a help to Clinton's presidential chances than he will be to his own. The first bonus that Sanders provides for Clinton, say her supporters, is that he becomes a foil. One of Clinton's Democratic allies in Congress explained that with a country that prefers general election candidates closer to the middle, Sanders will always offer proof that Clinton is not really that far left. He does for Clinton what Howard Dean did for John Kerry in 2004. Clinton can have it both ways though. If Sanders doesn't press the case against Clinton, she can pick and choose which of his policies she can associate herself with in order to maintain support within her own party among liberals (who already overwhelmingly approve of her candidacy). So when Sanders announced his campaign, Clinton just hugged him, writing on Twitter: ""I agree with Bernie. Focus must be on helping America's middle class. GOP would hold them back. I welcome him to the race. -H."" Clinton is able to so easily pick and choose that no one noticed that in her pitch as the ""people's champion"" she is copying almost word for word language that Sanders used before her in his speeches. Here's a riff that Sanders has been using for months: ""It is disgraceful that millionaire hedge fund managers are able to pay lower effective tax rates than truck drivers or nurses because they take advantage of a variety of loopholes that their lobbyists wrote."" And here is what Clinton said in her opening remarks at her first campaign event in Iowa: ""And there's something wrong when hedge fund managers pay lower tax rates than nurses or the truckers that I saw on I-80 as I was driving here over the last two days."" In 2012 Rep. Ron Paul and Mitt Romney had a symbiotic relationship in the Republican campaign. Paul elevated his own profile and gave his voters an outlet, but he never pointed out the yawning gaps between what he claimed to believe so deeply and the positions of the man who was on his way to being the party's inevitable nominee. It's way too early to see if Sanders will play the same role for Clinton, but it has started out that way. Sanders is such a long shot that those who share his views might be OK with the consolation prize of imitation from Clinton. But if her move to the left is simply rhetorical, she can shed that rhetoric in the general election as candidates often do. This would be another reason for Sanders to press his case with more definition. Sanders says he's never run a negative ad and he has asked the campaign press not to cover gossip. Good and good. A campaign of ideas it shall be then. If that's what he actually wants though, his competition isn't the Republican Party. At least not yet. His competition is Hillary Clinton. Right now the party whose nomination he wants thinks she is the safe, electable, competent candidate who believes a more reasonable version of some of the same things he does. It's a very comfortable arrangement."	How Bernie Sanders Running for President Helps Hillary Clinton.
23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/04/bernie_sanders_announces_his_presidential_campaign_the_vermont_socialist.html	"Why is a 73-year-old socialist from Vermont running for president when he surely knows he can't win? Sen. Bernie Sanders has decided to take the plunge into forbidding waters for the same reason earlier socialists campaigned for the office: to protest the current order and promote major reforms his rivals either oppose or support only when doing so juices their standings in the polls. Sanders is going to compete in Democratic primaries so he can debate Hillary Clinton and attract media that would otherwise ignore a passionate, white-haired independent with an uncompromising left-wing agenda. Not that he has much choice: Since the 1950s, the United States hasn't had a third party capable of disseminating its anti-capitalist politics to the public at large. During the first half of the 20th century, however, radicals like Sanders could join the Socialist Party of America, which boasted more than 100,000 members at its height. The SPA ran thousands of candidates for offices both high and low. It even managed to elect a couple of congressmen as well as dozens of mayors in locales as diverse as Milwaukee; Berkeley, California; and the little railroad town of Antlers, Oklahoma. Many of the reforms the party advocated ended up becoming law. Beginning in 1900, Eugene Victor Debs ran five times for president, never gaining more than 6 percent of the popular vote. The charismatic former union leader crisscrossed the nation, stretching out his long arms as if to touch the admiring crowds whom he urged to destroy ""the foul and decaying system"" and erect a ""cooperative commonwealth"" in its place. But Debs' platform also included such ""immediate"" demands as women's suffrage, a progressive income tax, an eight-hour day, a ban on child labor, and a vote for the residents of the District of Columbia that no longer seem radical at all. After Debs' death in 1926, Norman Thomas made six of his own quixotic runs for the White House, becoming the one homegrown socialist whom most Americans could identify. A former Presbyterian minister, Thomas preached the same utopian gospel as Debs had. ""I am not the champion of lost causes, but the champion of causes not yet won,"" he liked to say. But Thomas also stumped for reforms that were a great deal more popular than the abolition of private property. His 1932 platform included a minimum wage, government-funded pensions for the elderly, unemployment compensation, and national health insurance. By the end of the decade, Franklin Roosevelt and the Democratic Congress had enacted each of these proposals, save the last one, which the physicians' lobby condemned as ""socialized medicine."" Although Sanders has no leftist party machinery behind him and is too intelligent to predict a socialist future, he might be able to assume a role in the current campaign similar to that which Debs and Thomas once played. Hillary Clinton has begun to talk, very carefully, about seeking solutions to four decades of economic inequality. The Republicans who aspire to be president mostly blame the problem on broken families and lousy public schools. But Sanders is perpetually on the attack, armed with an unvarnished class-conscious message that, until the emergence of Occupy Wall Street, had long been absent from the public square. ""The true greatness of a country is not measured by the sum of its millionaires and billionaires,"" his senatorial website announces. ""Rather, a great nation is one in which justice, equality and dignity prevail for all."" Count on Sanders to fight for reforms that will discomfort the comfortable. He will demand a minimum wage of $15 an hour, legislation to make it easier to organize unions, a big increase in Social Security payments largely paid for by higher taxes on the wealthy, the aggressive development of renewable energy sources, and an end to the dominion of big money in politics. The senator from Vermont is one of the sponsors of a constitutional amendment that would overturn the Supreme Court's decision in the Citizens United case. He might even call for prosecuting and jailing the people whom he blasted in a marathon 2010 speech as ""the crooks on Wall Street whose actions resulted in the severe recession ... whose illegal, reckless actions have resulted in millions of Americans losing their jobs, their homes, [and] their savings."" Sanders won't spare the Democratic front-runner either. ""On the same day that Hillary Clinton visited three homes of wealthy Manhattan benefactors to raise an estimated $1 million in campaign funds,"" his website announced this week, ""Sen. Sanders gave a Howard University audience a sneak preview of a campaign platform that is squarely aimed at 'the billionaire class.' "" As long as she runs far ahead in the polls, Clinton can avoid responding to such rhetoric. But as the unrequited longing for Sen. Elizabeth Warren demonstrates, many liberal activists thrill to tough, left-wing populist talk and endorse most of the policies Sanders favors. Just as no Republican can win the White House without the enthusiastic support of the Tea Party and the evangelical right, it will be difficult for a Democrat to triumph without the kind of people who may not know much about Sanders but will like much of what he says. They may pressure Clinton to echo it, too. A century ago, Debs told Americans it was ""better to vote for what you want and not get it than to vote for what you don't want and get it."" The raspy-voiced Vermonter, who still speaks in a Brooklyn accent, will base his campaign on that same logic. Bernie Sanders is not going to win. But in losing he may do more to advance his causes than if he had never run at all."	Why a Socialist Running for President Isn't As Ridiculous As You Think

This wasn't 1968, when fires touched huge swaths of the city and thousands left their homes. Instead, in a few areas around the Inner Harbor and East and West Baltimore, scattered groups of looters smashed stores, set fires, and confronted police, with residents watching from stoops or out of windows. At the intersection of North Avenue and Fulton Avenue, a phalanx of police officers watched as a collection of young men smashed two liquor stores and yelled grievances into the night sky. Later, a few remaining young men would set a damaged car on fire, which would burn brightly against the vacant homes and boarded businesses that define the neighborhood landscape. A mile away, police were dealing with damage from the initial confrontation at the Mondawmin Mall, where that afternoon stores were looted and vehicles were set ablaze. Likewise, across town, on Broadway Street, an uncompleted home for seniors burned down. It's unconfirmed whether this was connected to the riots. Still, the fire added to the sense of chaos in the city, which was underscored by another police presence, this time on Monument Street, next to Johns Hopkins hospital. As of midnight, these areas had died down. But it's unclear if the relative quiet will last. The elements that fueled the disturbance--anger over the death of Freddie Gray, silence from authorities, an aggressive police response, and the idle energy of young men--are still present, and Tuesday could bring another spark.

It's also going to make it harder to go on offense. When Clinton announced her campaign, she outlined four big fights she would take on. One of the pillars of her pitch was that she wanted to fix ""our dysfunctional political system and get unaccountable money out of it once and for all, even if that takes a constitutional amendment."" This position has political appeal. Voters think the system is rigged, and they think big money helps those in power keep it rigged. For a populist campaign of the kind Clinton wants to run, it would be helpful to run against Republican operations where the donors are hidden and where mountains of money pour in against her. One of the big questions in politics is just how much big money donations compromise the people who receive them. No matter how noble the cause or how good a speaker you are, when someone writes a check with a string of zeros, there's a chance he wants something in return beyond your good works and inspirational message. That's certainly what Democrats, including Bill Clinton, have suggested about the vast amounts of cash that go to conservative candidates. It just stands to reason. And now Republicans are saying the same thing about Hillary Clinton. One way to answer this question is to have the process be transparent so everyone can all see if huge donations shape policy or increase the attention a politician pays to a particular policy--either publicly or privately. The Clinton team will make the distinction that they were transparent when it came to donations made to the Clinton Foundation. But the Clinton Foundation disclosure is limited, and in some cases it wasn't done at all, according to the New York Times:"	Is Hillary Clinton in Any Position to Denounce the Money Warping Our Politics?

Scott Walker staked a new position in the Republican Party argument over immigration. ""In terms of legal immigration, how we need to approach that going forward is saying--the next president and the next Congress need to make decisions about a legal immigration system that's based on, first and foremost, on protecting American workers and American wages,"" he said, ""It is a fundamentally lost issue by many in elected positions today--is what is this doing for American workers looking for jobs, what is this doing to wages, and we need to have that be at the forefront of our discussion going forward."" In the past, Republicans were merely opposed to illegal immigration. Mitt Romney touted ""self-deportation"" as a solution to unauthorized immigrants, while figures like Iowa Rep. Steve King channeled grassroots intensity to torpedo comprehensive reform and force a new course for Republicans such as Sen. Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, and even Walker, who was for immigration reform before his move to the national stage. Legal immigration, by contrast, was uncontroversial. The same Romney who took a hard line on illegal immigration also promised foreign-born students that he would ""staple a green card"" to their college diplomas, and the same Sen. Ted Cruz who denounces ""amnesty"" at every opportunity has also argued for increasing the cap on H-1B visas--for skilled workers--by 500 percent. In other words, Walker's newfound skepticism of legal immigration is a real departure for the Republican mainstream. If he were a more factional candidate--like Ben Carson or even Sen. Rand Paul--it wouldn't matter. Yes, the margins give you the freedom to say anything, but they also give your opponents the freedom to ignore you. Walker is far from marginal. He's a conservative superstar with major backing and activist enthusiasm. And when he questions our regime of legal immigration, other candidates listen. To that point, think back to the 2012 primary, when Romney foreclosed a challenge from Texas Gov. Rick Perry by challenging him on immigration. After Perry declared that Republicans ""don't have a heart"" if they oppose education subsidies for undocumented children during a September 2011 debate, Romney responded with incredulity over supporting any ""illegals"":"	Why Scott Walker's New Stance Against Legal Immigration Could Shake Up the GOP Presidential Race
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/04/jeb_bush_destroying_campaign_finance_rules_his_tactics_will_be_the_future.html	"In February, the Campaign Legal Center, a group which works on campaign finance reform issues, released a ""white paper"" contending that many of the leading potential presidential candidates were likely breaking federal law by not declaring their candidacy or setting up a ""testing the waters"" committee for a presidential election run. Such a declaration, among other things, limits donors to giving only $2,700 to the (would-be) candidate for the presidential primary season. It was an excellent report, but many shrugged off its findings as just one more way in which the campaign finance system has begun to unravel since the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision. But news this week that Republican (pseudo-non)candidate Jeb Bush intends to outsource much of his campaign to an allied super PAC reveals that Bush's decision to delay declaring his candidacy has allowed him to undermine one of the last rules in campaign finance law. Worse, his approach will be the new model of presidential funding in future elections and greatly increases the threat that large donors will have even greater influence over electoral and policy outcomes than they already have. The idea that Jeb Bush is not ""testing the waters"" for a presidential run is absurd. He is appearing at presidential candidate forums, traveling to early primary and caucus states, and leading the Republican field in fundraising. While Bush isn't alone in delaying his formal campaign announcement and the rules that go with it, he has created unprecedented connections with the ""Right to Rise"" super PAC, whose sole purpose appears to be the election of Bush as president.* The Sunlight Foundation reported that Bush has already headlined 47 events for his super PAC, with five more events this week. And the Associated Press reported that once Bush becomes a candidate, he plans to outsource many of the core functions of his campaign to Right to Rise, including expensive television advertising and direct mail. To understand why this development is so troubling, we need to go back a few years to the emergence of super PACs and the argument for why these groups are allowed to accept unlimited contribution limits to support candidates for office. The Supreme Court has long recognized that the government constitutionally may limit contributions to candidate campaign committees to prevent corruption or even the appearance of it. If you can give a candidate $1 million, the candidate may be too compliant to your wishes, and the public could believe the candidate is being bought. Although you have a First Amendment right to contribute to candidates, the court has allowed limits on the amounts to serve these anti-corruption purposes. Before Citizens United, however, it was not only candidate committees that were limited in the contributions they could receive. Political action committees, or PACs, operating in federal elections to support or oppose candidates for office also could accept no more than a $5,000 contribution from an individual in the election season. They also couldn't take money from corporate or union treasuries. In Citizens United, the Supreme Court held that independent spending by corporations and others could neither corrupt a candidate nor lead to the appearance of corruption. When spending is truly independent, the court declared, the absence of coordination prevented corruption. In litigation and administrative action after Citizens United, federal courts and the Federal Election Commission allowed PACs that did not make contributions to candidates to accept unlimited sums from individuals, corporations, unions, and others. The theory was that if independent spending cannot corrupt, then contributions to fund that independent spending couldn't corrupt either. The theory rests on the idea that the candidate and the super PAC aren't coordinating their strategies. While a candidate can support a super PAC and even ask people to give money to it, the candidate and the PAC cannot agree on campaign strategy, such as what ads to run and where. This in theory makes giving to the super PAC less valuable to the candidate because the super PAC might act at cross-purposes with the candidate's campaign. That theory is thin to begin with--super PACs are valuable because they have already proven adept at following a candidate's lead without formal coordination--but Bush's campaign strategy has completely undermined it. Because Bush claims he is neither a candidate nor even seriously considering a presidential run, the anti-coordination rules don't apply to him.  He can talk about future campaign strategy all he wants and set the Right to Rise robot to work once he declares his candidacy. More importantly, by participating in literally dozens of fundraisers for Right to Rise during a period when donors know he can fully direct what it does, donors know the best way of gaining influence over Bush (and the chances for influence with a future Bush administration) is by giving money to the group--lots of it. In the old days (think the days of the fundraising of Bush's brother, George W. Bush), the main way of gaining influence was by becoming a campaign bundler. Bundlers not only give the maximum few thousand dollars to the candidate's campaign; they also get friends, relatives, and acquaintances to do the same. Now, one doesn't have to become a bundler for the campaign to curry favor: One can simply write a check for $1 million or more to Right to Rise. By signaling that Right to Rise is his campaign arm, Jeb Bush has broken down the wall between his super PAC and his campaign committee in the eyes of donors. Preventing coordination and preserving independence was one of the last walls that were left. The next step will be simply handing $1 million checks to candidates. Right now that's still illegal, but campaign finance opponents will challenge those candidate contribution limits as ineffective since (the Bush campaign will show) super PACs can serve almost the same purpose. Indeed, campaign lawyer Jim Bopp (the brains behind the Citizens United lawsuit) signaled as much this week, arguing that the way to take unaccountable money out of politics is to let individuals give whatever they want directly to candidates. Bush is more than lying about his intentions to become a presidential candidate. He's undermining what little law we have left to stop the super wealthy from having even greater influence over our elections and politics. It's something to consider as Jeb Bush gets his audition before the Koch brothers, who have promised to have their network spend up to $889 million on the upcoming elections. *Correction, April 22, 2015: This article originally misstated that Bush himself created the Right to Rise super PAC.

To that end, Clinton and his allies were enthusiastic supporters of legislation such as the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, and the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996--laws that spoke to the cultural concerns of lower-income whites. Clinton didn't succeed in luring working-class whites back, but he stopped the bleeding, strengthening Democrats in Rust Belt and mid-Atlantic states, where they were crucial. And while this wouldn't save Al Gore in his bid for the presidency, it would keep Democrats competitive in House and Senate races and contribute to their huge wins in the 2006 midterm elections. Now the picture is different. Since Barack Obama's election in 2008, working-class whites--and whites overall--have left the Democratic Party in droves. At the same time, the party has moved to the left, pushed by an Obama-led coalition of young people, minorities, and socially liberal whites. One result is that, under a more liberal Democratic president, those Clinton-era policies have come under sustained assault. Before the Supreme Court struck its key provision, the Defense of Marriage Act was all but abandoned by the Obama administration, part of the rapid march toward broad acceptance of same-sex marriage. Welfare reform is still law, and the crime bill is still on the books, but as with DOMA, a new generation of liberals has challenged the underpinnings of both, with louder calls for state support of families and children and greater skepticism of the criminal justice system. The fact of this new coalition puts Hillary Clinton, who seeks to succeed Obama on her own merits even as she's indelibly tied to the first Clinton presidency, in a difficult place. Her task is to reassemble and re-energize Obama's coalition, while also winning whites who may have left the party during Obama's tenure, and even moving some whites (namely, white women) to the Democratic column. But here's the challenge: To do the former--and build Obama-esque enthusiasm among college students, black Americans, Latinos, and educated whites--Hillary may have to stand against the policies of her husband's administration. We've already seen this in small doses. On Tuesday, during a campaign stop in New Hampshire, Clinton met questions on an international trade deal--the Trans-Pacific Partnership--with skepticism. ""We need to build things, too,"" she said, positioning herself--if slightly--with labor unions who oppose the deal, and echoing an earlier statement from her campaign. ""[Clinton] will be watching closely to see what is being done to crack down on currency manipulation, improve labor rights, protect the environment and health, promote transparency, and open new opportunities for our small businesses to export overseas,"" said an aide. Likewise, Clinton has ""evolved"" on same-sex marriage, endorsing marriage equality in 2013 and--more recently--calling on the Supreme Court to ""come down on the side of same-sex couples being guaranteed that constitutional right."" But these are easy lifts. Bill Clinton campaigned as a pro-labor candidate--even as he oversaw labor's decline--and Hillary Clinton did the same in her 2008 campaign, running as a populist champion for union workers and others outside of the ""wine-track"" Obama coalition. And at this point in American politics, it's the most painless thing in the world for a Democratic politician to support same-sex marriage. To that point, Bill Clinton has repudiated the law, calling it ""discriminatory"" and a ""vestige"" of a less free society. Harder are moves on welfare and crime, which still pack a punch in political life, even as the latter falls in salience, especially compared with the 1990s. On welfare, the upside for mobilization is straightforward. In the last three years, a growing group of liberals--from politicians to bloggers--has called for increasing a range of federal benefits. Some want higher Social Security benefits as a response to a looming retirement crisis. Others want greater federal funds for child care or college education, and others still want the government to strengthen key safety net programs. In terms of priorities, this is a sharp turn from Bill Clinton's administration, where the goal was reducing these programs or finding ways to make them more market-friendly. And if Hillary Clinton were to endorse them--and promise to expand public benefits--she would be making a real break from her husband's presidency. The same is even truer of crime. After years of declining crime rates and action from anti-incarceration activists, there's growing momentum among Democrats and Republicans for criminal justice reform, all aimed at shrinking the prison population after decades of growth. This has become even more acute in the last year, as police shootings in New York, Ohio, and Missouri sparked a national movement for police reform among young black Americans. More than once, Clinton has voiced support for the activists, declaring, ""Yes, black lives matter,"" at an event last December. But she hasn't taken a position on the substantive questions of criminal justice reform, from drug policy to federal sentencing. We don't know how she would respond if asked to answer for Bill Clinton's punitive criminal justice policies, which expanded the war on drugs and contributed to mass incarceration. With that said, a promise to reject those policies--and to move back from the Clinton-era status quo--might appeal to black Americans whose communities have been harmed by mass incarceration. Indeed, it might even be the ingredient that helps Clinton energize black voters and engage a vital part of the Obama coalition. In which case, would she reject that part of her husband's legacy? If Hillary's overarching political task is capturing the Obama coalition while distinguishing herself from him and Bill, the obvious answer to that question is yes, she must. A Hillary Clinton who ran as a political corrective to both presidencies--who refused to pander to social conservatives or bend to Republicans in Congress--might preclude liberal challengers and do well in the general election. But there's a downside. A Hillary Clinton who did that--who touted the liberal line on crime and social spending and other areas--would continue the political story of Obama's presidency; not of shaping the new Democratic coalition, but of ending the old one her husband tried to rebuild."	Why Hillary Clinton Must Turn Her Back on Parts of Her Husband's Political Legacy to Win in 2016

The next reporter who corners you at a diner might pop the question. No, she doesn't want to marry you. But she might ask whether you'd attend a gay wedding. In the last week, that question has been posed to at least five candidates: Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, Govs. Scott Walker and John Kasich, and former Sen. Rick Santorum. In general, their answers have been weak. Here's what they've said, and how you can handle the question better than they did. 1. Don't duck. This is a personal question. If you try to change the subject to law or policy, you'll look like you're trying to hide something. That's what happened to Cruz on Thursday, when conservative talk-show host Hugh Hewitt pressed him:	"How Republican Candidates Should Answer the Question: ""Would You Attend a Gay Wedding?"""
