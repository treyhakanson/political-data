And then he paused, savoring the moment. Every viewer knew that there was more coming (it turned out to be, rather predictably, that the state of our Union is ""strong""), but after listening to the president for an hour, those nine words could have been the subtext of the entire speech. This was a remarkably confident president, almost jaunty in his bearing, and exuding a good nature that seemed to be the result of sheer self-satisfaction. It may not signal anything about the eighth year of his presidency, but it certainly shows that he feels confident about the achievements of the first seven. It all started with a joke. ""I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa,"" President Obama kidded. And then he departed from his prepared remarks. ""I've been there,"" Obama ad-libbed. ""I'll be shaking hands afterwards if you want some tips."" For a president so often accused by his conservative critics of being solipsistic, it was a bold opening; it also set the stage for the cocky tone he held throughout the night. The president's approval ratings may be on the wrong side of 50 percent, and he doesn't seem to care. Obama ticked through a number of economic indicators with the air of a man who was not only fed up with Donald Trump's nonsense, but also disinclined to hear more about falling American standards of living and a hollowed-out manufacturing sector--the very rhetoric that has been the lifeblood of Bernie Sanders' surprisingly hearty campaign. The foreign policy section of the speech displayed a president with even more swagger. After a brief discussion of ISIS (which Obama still annoyingly calls ISIL, with all the stubbornness of an old British imperialist mumbling about Ceylon or Madras), Obama perked up, sounding the most passionate and lively that he ever has about the terrorist group. ""But the American people should know that with or without congressional action,"" he stated, ""ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them. If you doubt America's commitment--or mine--to see that justice is done, ask Osama bin Laden. Ask the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell. When you come after Americans, we go after you."" If the near-Bushian undertones weren't evident enough, Obama continued, even more boldly, ""It may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limit."" It's hard to know the precise source of Obama's confidence, but it's not unfounded: He has led the most domestically significant presidency since at least Ronald Reagan, if not Lyndon Johnson. This past year saw two giant (if still provisional) achievements in foreign policy: a climate deal in Paris and a nuclear deal with Iran. Obama has always seemed to exhibit frustration with a media culture that he considers focused on trivial matters, rather than actual achievements. Tuesday night he seemed to show that he had made a certain amount of peace with his standing in opinion polls precisely because he feels so certain of his standing in the history books. Even so, the best part of the speech was the least jaunty. ""When politicians insult Muslims, whether abroad or our fellow citizens, when a mosque is vandalized, or a kid is called names, that does not make us safer,"" Obama stated with dead seriousness. ""That's not telling it like it is. It's just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals. And it betrays who we are as a country."" Obama was signaling that he knew the rhetoric on race and immigration and Islam is much worse than it was when he took office. It is one area where the president and his administration, despite their best efforts, have not left the country on stronger footing. And in the midst of an otherwise buoyant performance, the president seemed to recognize that, on some issues, it isn't time for an end-zone dance.

1	1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/barack_obama_s_final_state_of_the_union_was_a_plea_for_cooperation.html	"More than anything else, President Obama's final State of the Union address was a plea for cooperation and compromise--an appeal to America's citizenry, not just its public. ""[D]emocracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens,"" said Obama at the conclusion of his address. ""It doesn't work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice, or that our political opponents are unpatriotic."" It also doesn't work, Obama argued, if the system puts limits and barriers on democratic participation. It's why, in the midst of this appeal, he called for nonpartisan redistricting and moves to ""make voting easier, not harder."" But policy wasn't the thrust of the message. This was a rebuke to forces of fear and cynicism--a call for decency and obligation in our politics. ""So, my fellow Americans,"" said Obama, ""whatever you may believe, whether you prefer one party or no party, our collective future depends on your willingness to uphold your obligations as a citizen."" All of this speaks to Obama's particular view of American exceptionalism, where America is shorthand for its people, and their ability--and willingness--to confront America with its ideals and push the nation to achieve them. With this final State of the Union address, Obama is asking Americans to do just that. To live up to the traits that make them exceptional. If you hold to a certain kind of civic nationalism--expansive, pluralistic, progressive--it's hard to find fault with this articulation. But this section of the State of the Union--this call for our better angels as citizens--sits in tension with the rest. Obama has an expansive, positive agenda that grows from his belief that America can't prosper without an active and interventionist government. ""We need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security,"" he said. Obama wants stronger retirement programs, a fierce effort to fight climate change, new investment in science, technology, and infrastructure. He wants universal preschool, paid family leave, and greater access to health care. More than that, however, Obama has a diagnosis of American society that comes with several questions. His agenda is an attempt to answer those questions, and he believes that the country writ large will have to answer those questions: ""[H]ow do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy?; how do we make technology work for us, and not against us -- especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change? [H]ow do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman? [H]ow can we make our politics reflect what's best in us, and not what's worst?"" The problem is that these aren't neutral questions. At each turn, they carry an implicit judgment that stems from particular beliefs and a particular ideology. Each question holds a premise. Which means, if we take disagreement and difference seriously, then we must acknowledge that people disagree about these premises. ""How do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security"" only makes sense if you believe that everyone deserves a fair shot. But not everyone does. Not just by their revealed preferences--what they do--but as a matter of ideology and belief. Not everyone believes America should shy away as the world's ""policeman."" Not everyone sees politics as a place for cooperation. Obama was prosaic in this State of the Union, but he was also cocky. He bragged; about America's economic growth, about its global leadership, about his record as president of the United States. He's proud of his tenure and clearly hopes a future president extends his legacy, or at least tackles his questions. But that's not guaranteed. The leading GOP candidates for president--Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz--bring fundamentally different premises to American society and ask fundamentally different questions. Large and influential parts of the Republican Party hold radically minimalist views of government and want to change the Constitution to achieve them. Because we live in a society of real and irreducible disagreement--and because it's channeled in our politics--there's a real chance that Obama's legacy won't last longer than his administration. Which brings us back to Obama's conclusion. Obama seems to anticipate this kind of objection. ""A better politics doesn't mean we have to agree on everything,"" he said. ""This is a big country, with different regions and attitudes and interests."" He continues: ""Our Founders distributed power between states and branches of government, and expected us to argue, just as they did, over the size and shape of government, over commerce and foreign relations, over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security."" Obama takes this seriously. But does he take it seriously enough? The founders' conflicts, after all, eventually ended in civil war. Democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens, and it doesn't work if we hold each other in deep mutual suspicion. But we should also be clear-eyed about what democracy also means: Consensus is extraordinarily difficult, and at times--like this one--often impossible.

Terry Branstad, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, Ann Coulter, bomb-throwing Democratic Rep. Alan Grayson, Sen. Ted Cruz's former Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe, a smattering of other constitutional law professors, your super liberal mother-in-law, and really anyone else who enjoys a good time all have in common? None of them will forthrightly declare that Canadian-born Sen. Ted Cruz is eligible to serve as president. After Trump renewed speculation that Cruz is constitutionally ineligible to serve as president, others refused to rule out the possibility too. Some of these Cruz birthers, like the outlying constitutional law professor who wrote this Washington Post opinion piece, believe that the consensus understanding of the Constitution's ""natural born citizen"" clause--that it is meant to include U.S. citizens who are born as such, even if born abroad--is incorrect. But others may (may!) be fueling the skepticism because they consider it fun and/or politically savvy to troll Cruz. To wit, an unseemly number of leading Republicans are claiming they don't want to get ""involved"" in the question of whether Cruz, who has a better chance than most of becoming the Republican presidential nominee, would be constitutionally able to serve as president. Cruz tries very hard to act as though he dislikes McConnell, and there's little doubt that McConnell's own dislike of Cruz is genuine. Cruz has anchored his national political career on conservative rejection of McConnell and all he supposedly represents: spineless congressional leadership, the RINO establishment, funding the federal government in a timely manner, etc. So when McConnell was asked whether the Senate would pass a resolution confirming Cruz's eligibility for the nation's top office, as the chamber did on a bipartisan basis for Panama-born Sen. John McCain in 2008, credit McConnell for not laughing out loud. ""I just don't think the Senate ought to get into the middle of this,"" McConnell said Sunday. ""These guys will all slug it out in Iowa and New Hampshire. We'll have a nominee hopefully by sometime in the spring."" Priebus, who is so worried about appearing like he's picking favorites that he'll pretend to be excited about Trump's presence in the race, had a similarly noncommittal response when asked.

3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/nikki_haley_s_state_of_the_union_rebuttal_cannot_succeed.html	"On Tuesday night, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley will be the last Republican with the misfortune to address the nation following a President Obama State of the Union address. The SOTU rebuttal is a famously awful duty because the rebutter is denied the theatrics that make it a worthwhile activity for the president. The rebutter does not get to enjoy an introduction, like a boss, from the House sergeant-at-arms. She is not met with laudatory applause and handshakes from members of Congress, senators, Cabinet members, and Supreme Court justices. The rebutter does not enjoy mandatory ovations at the end of each line. All the rebutter can do is give a shorter statement in an empty room and pray that she has not come across as hilarious in some way that embarrasses the party that's already out of power. This is not easy, because the rebuttal's viewing audience is comprised almost entirely of members of the press, who are forced to watch the stupid rebuttal as part of their jobs, and members of the press are unusually mean-spirited creatures. There will be no official State of the Union in 2017, though whoever is president will get a chance to address a joint session of Congress shortly after his or her inauguration. If Democrats retain the presidency, Republicans can look forward to several more years of fielding fresh figures to serve as the random, saccharine voice that comes on TV after the president, saying ""nuh-uh!"" If Republicans win back the presidency, this will be their last rebuttal for a while. Not to make Gov. Haley nervous or anything, but revisiting some of the memorable rebuttals of the Obama years shows just how unusually difficult a task this is. Bobby Jindal, 2009 Before Bobby Jindal was an ex-governor whose project to ruin his state as an advancement mechanism for his national political ambitions failed calamitously, he was a thirtysomething political prodigy whom party leaders hoped might serve as a counterweight to the Democrats' new star, Barack Obama. Jindal, elected in 2007, was the subject of vice-presidential speculation in 2008 and later granted the opportunity to rebut President Obama's first address to a joint session of Congress in February, 2009. (It wasn't technically a State of the Union, but it was basically the same thing.) Re-reading Jindal's speech now, it's fun to remember that brief moment when Republicans didn't publicly trash President Obama with each drawn breath. Until the health care debate really got moving later in 2009, there was actually fear among party leaders that criticizing the popular, newly installed president would backfire. Jindal's address did criticize Obama's first major legislative victory as president, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, but targeted its criticisms solely at ""Democratic leaders in Congress"" for ""rejecting a [bipartisan] approach"" toward that stimulus package. ""Who among us would ask our children for a loan, so we could spend money we do not have, on things we do not need?"" Jindal said. ""That is precisely what the Democrats in Congress just did."" Jindal included, among the things we do not need, ""$140 million for something called 'volcano monitoring,' "" adding, to winces, ""instead of monitoring volcanoes, what Congress should be monitoring is the eruption of spending in Washington, D.C."" A volcano in Alaska erupted about a month later, offering a useful example of importance of volcano-monitoring monies. But none of this is what Jindal's speech is really remembered for. Jindal introduced himself to the country in a boyish, sing-songy voice that was roundly compared to that of Kenneth the Page from 30 Rock. That line about ""volcano monitoring"" was indicative of its flat humor. It was a flop that became a go-to lesson on the importance of first impressions in national politics. Gov. Bob McDonnell, 2010 After winning election in 2009 in the newly purple state that Democrats had governed for the previous eight years, Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell was the latest rising star expected to save the GOP from its lowly depths. The party solved one of Jindal's main problems--the eerily silent setting of a governor's mansion hallway--by positioning McDonnell before a session of the Virginia House of Delegates. McDonnell gave a speech that no one remembers, which is a sign of a successful State of the Union rebuttal. McDonnell, who was supposed to restore the Obama-era Republican Party from being a petulant, reactionary force to one worthy again of presidential responsibilities, was later convicted of accepting bribes to buy a bunch of stuff. Barring a last-minute rescue from the Supreme Court, he will soon be in jail. But at least he's not Bobby Jindal. Rep. Michele Bachmann, 2011 The delightful gentlewoman from Minnesota chose to deliver her own, unofficial ""Tea Party"" rebuttal to President Obama in 2011. Republican Party leaders were thrilled with that decision, which distracted the viewing public from Rep. Paul's Ryan's boring, old official response. The speech itself consisted of typically jazzed-up Bachmann verbiage. She employed charts to illustrate misleading arguments. (""In October of 2001,"" she said, ""our national unemployment rate was at 5.3 percent. In 2008, it was at 6.6 percent. But just eight months after President Obama promised lower unemployment, that rate spiked to a staggering 10.1 percent."" Sounds good; no further information to add there!) The address is mostly remembered, though, for how Bachmann didn't look directly into the television camera, which Saturday Night Live went on to mock the next week. Sen. Marco Rubio, 2013 This guy had a drink of water. That is the most acutely memorable moment over seven years of rebuttals to President Obama's State of the Union speeches. Rubio continues to joke about it, as he should. But further reporting from Politico years later confirmed that Rubio, a viable contender for the Republican presidential nomination, continues to drink water. Will Gov. Haley drink water Tuesday night? Will she speak in a weird voice? Will she go to jail in the future for something unrelated? Will she not look into the camera? The less memorable she is, the better her own 2016 prospects will be. See more of Slate's State of the Union coverage."

4	4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/obama_is_right_not_to_endorse_hillary_clinton.html	"On Sunday, the Democratic horse race got a little tighter, and a little more tense. According to the latest survey from Marist, NBC News, and the Wall Street Journal, Hillary Clinton leads Bernie Sanders in Iowa. But this isn't news. What's news is that her lead has dropped to just three points over the Vermont senator. In fairness, this is one poll, and in the average of all Iowa surveys, Clinton still leads by more than 10 points. But the median result of the past five polls is a Clinton lead of 9 percentage points, in line with the average and evidence of a tightening race. And this is on top of her large deficit in New Hampshire, where Sanders leads by 4 in the latest poll and just under 5 points in the average. Clinton says she isn't worried. ""[Y]ou know these polls go up, they go down,"" she said on Sunday in an interview with CBS News' Face the Nation. ""I stay pretty focused, as I think we all should, on what we have to do to build on the progress of the Obama administration, but go even further."" But her next sentence, an implicit jab at Sanders' position on guns, belied that confidence. ""And that's why I have outlined a very significant agenda to raise wages and to take on the gun lobby and to be making America safe in every way that I can."" On that score, Clinton has a new ad touting her electability. ""They're backwards, even dangerous,"" warns a narrator over footage of the GOP presidential field, from Sen. Ted Cruz promising to ""carpet bomb"" ISIS ""into oblivion"" to Chris Christie telling a man to ""sit down and shut up."" ""Who's the one candidate who can stop them?"" asks the voice-over, prompting a clip from Clinton's testimony to the House committee on the Benghazi attacks. ""Tested, and tough,"" says the narrator. ""To stop them, stand with her."" It's a strong advertisement. But again, it shows the extent to which the Clinton camp is nervous about Sanders' rise and durability, even as they voice total confidence. And as if to highlight this narrow race, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough relayed a message from the president while speaking on NBC's Meet the Press. ""When can we expect [President Obama] to make his choice public on who he supports in the Democratic primary?"" asked host Chuck Todd. ""Well, we'll do exactly what has been done in the past,"" said McDonough, ruling out an endorsement from the president. McDonough has his history wrong. In the 2000 primary, President Bill Clinton endorsed Al Gore against Sen. Bill Bradley, who--like Sanders--ran a liberal campaign against the party establishment. With that said, there aren't enough examples--sitting Democratic president endorsing a candidate in the party primaries--to say there's a tradition here. It's neither normal nor unusual for Obama to demur. Still, the nature of the thing makes it noteworthy. You can read Obama's decision as a bad omen for Clinton--a vote of no confidence in his old rival. Or, if you adjust your focus from that of Obama's relationship with Clinton to his place as Democratic Party leader, you can see this as the best possible decision for the presidential primary. If there's a danger in the contest between Clinton and Sanders, it's the belief--arguably justified, given the fracases over debate scheduling and voter contact files--that the Democratic National Committee has placed its thumb on the scale for Clinton. An Obama endorsement for Clinton--his first Secretary of State--would make this even worse, fueling anger among some segment of Sanders' supporters. Which, if Clinton won the nomination, would make reconciliation more difficult. And on the other end, an Obama endorsement for Sanders could rekindle the tensions of the 2008 primary, especially among Clinton's strongest and most dedicated supporters. By staying out of primary politics, Obama sidesteps all of this, and he gives an invaluable boost to Clinton should she win. If in June Clinton is the nominee after a tough fight against Sanders, she'll be a stronger candidate with greater legitimacy within the Democratic Party. Indeed, you could almost make the case that since she's favored to win--given her strong position with black and Latino voters, as well as more moderate Democrats--a New Hampshire and Iowa loss might be good for her campaign. It would turn this primary into a fierce contest that could prep the party for an even fiercer general election. And, for the liberal and left-wing activists who back Sanders, it deepens their experience and strengthens their position in the party long-term. Jesse Jackson ran two campaigns for the Democratic nomination, once in 1984 and again in 1988. No, he didn't win. But he presaged the present-day Democratic coalition--of minorities, young people, and educated liberal whites--and paved a future for black politicians with presidential ambitions. What's more, his campaign was a darkroom for a whole generation of Democratic operatives, who would work in other campaigns and seed the lessons of Jackson's effort throughout the Democratic Party. A long, hard-fought campaign could do the same for left-wing liberalism. If Team Sanders sticks to Democratic politics, win or lose, then 20 years from now, America might be looking at its first (democratic) socialist president.

The victory for the Mexican government was particularly sweet, coming six months after El Chapo's escape from prison, a humiliation for Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. Now it appears likely that El Chapo, whose real name is Joaquin Archivaldo Guzman Loera, will be extradited to the United States. And on Saturday evening, Rolling Stone published a long  story by Sean Penn, who somehow managed to interview El Chapo while he was on the run and who revealed that El Chapo wanted to make a movie about his own life. To discuss the latest twists in the ever-crazier El Chapo story, I talked to Alejandro Hope, the security and justice editor at El Daily Post and a former intelligence official in Mexico. We discussed whether El Chapo will ever make it to America, the future of the drug war, and what really drives Mexico's most notorious criminal. The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. Chotiner: Were you surprised El Chapo was captured this soon? Hope: Yes and no. His capture was inevitable. He was facing an array of forces that no man in Mexican history has ever faced. The Mexican government threw everything at the manhunt, and it also had the close cooperation of the United States intelligence community. Having said that, I was somewhat surprised by the speed at which he was captured. We underestimated the amount of resources, and how big of a humiliation his escape was. How will his arrest change the status quo in Mexico? It is an important event on two fronts. He is a symbol of impunity. Bringing him to justice is an important step. But more importantly, we are moving to a different era in Mexican organized crime. We are seeing more diverse and smaller gangs that are far more local. They are into things like extortion, kidnapping, theft, and less involved in international drug markets. El Chapo is one of the remnants of an earlier period of Mexican organized crime. He's definitely not the future. So this marks an important step. But is that step toward more fragmentation good for Mexico? Over the long run, yes. It is easier to battle predatory crime than transactional crime. Predatory means any crime where you have a direct victim: kidnapping, extortion, using violence for resources. Transactional is like drug trafficking. There is no direct victim and both parties in the exchange are committing a crime. That is far more difficult to combat for the rather simple reason that no one will go to the authorities. You need intelligence-heavy law enforcement for that. Kidnapping and extortion are a challenge, but less of a challenge than large-scale drug organizations that can buy chunks of the state. There is a theory out there that having El Chapo run his organization is, on the whole, better for Mexico because he is comparatively less violent than his rivals and allows for more stability. Do you think the Mexican government was sincerely committed to his capture? Yes I do, because the escape was such a blow to the Nieto administration. The president's approval rating reached a nadir. In the Sean Penn article, there are hints that there was some level of cooperation between the military and El Chapo's people. They are not mutually exclusive. You could have high-level people really going after him, and have low-level corruption in the military establishment. One thing that surprised me about the capture was that he was taken alive. I assumed the order would have been given or passed along that having him in prison again could lead to another humiliation, and extraditing him might be politically unpalatable. Did that surprise you? To some extent, but I think there are two reasons why he had to be presented alive. One is that the United States was very involved in this fight, and they wanted El Chapo alive and extradited because he is a massive source of information. And secondly, I don't think it would have been credible to Mexican public opinion if he had been killed. I don't think people would have believed it. So there would have been doubt? Hugely. Even now you have rumors that this wasn't El Chapo. Killing him would have been far worse. Do you think he will be extradited? Yeah. And for the first time the Mexican government is actually strongly signaling that it is its preference. Will there be a political backlash to that? Not really. There are very few voices out there calling for El Chapo to remain in Mexico. Is that because of the ""oh-shit-we-can't-deal-with-this"" factor after the last escape? Completely. It proved that there is no prison in Mexico which can hold him. If he is transferred to a maximum security prison in the United States, I assume he will not be able to keep control over his operations, whereas in Mexico he might have been able to. Yeah. During his 15 months in prison, he had 440 visits. The guy was in close contact with his minions outside. What do you make of that? How do you understand that in terms of the Mexican state? Was the president aware of that, do you think? He's aware now. Was he aware at the time? I'm not sure. The fact was that prison conditions for El Chapo became increasingly relaxed as time went by. There was open corruption, and he had a smart and very aggressive legal strategy fighting for a sort of habeas corpus. So El Chapo used that aggressively and won a number of privileges in the courts, including more visits. What will El Chapo's capture mean for his organization? The Sinaloa cartel probably will not fragment any time soon even if he is extradited. His co-leader, ""El Mayo,"" is still free. He might be able to maintain some level of coherence. And you do have a second-tier leadership that might also prevent a full-blown implosion of the cartel. Over the longer term, once El Mayo dies or retires or is imprisoned--and the guy is 67--you might see a succession battle, which might lead to the end of the Sinaloa cartel as we know it. But we are not probably close to that point. I'm sure this is the first interview you have ever done where someone has asked you about Sean Penn. What did you make of his story? What I found most impressive was how unimpressive El Chapo's answers were. You mean he has been built up as larger-than-life and in fact he is somewhat blah? Yeah. The guy didn't say anything. The answers coming from his mouth could have come from any street dealer. Penn didn't ask the tough questions or get into the mind of El Chapo. What would you have asked him? I would have asked him about some of the relevant episodes in the drug wars over the past 15 years, including why he broke with his longtime partners, the Beltran-Leyva brothers. Why did he choose to wage battle where he did? When did he decide to escape? How does he see the future of his organization? It sounds like you want to understand what drives him. What do you think drives him, besides money? Money and power, but if you look at the interview and the movie project, it is such an imprudent move for a man who is the object of a massive manhunt. It is so out of character that it may lead to some insights into his style. Maybe age and life on the run had finally got to him. And maybe he wanted a way out, and this was a subtle form of signaling. I think he is getting tired of it. How would it be a form of signaling? Explain that. This is speculative, and maybe he was just trying to exercise control and thinking about his legacy, but he might have been signaling the Mexican government that he wanted a deal where he remained in Mexican prison in exchange for information on rival gangs, or perhaps ending his involvement in drug trafficking. In Mexico that has not been used but in Colombia they have done that over the past quarter century. They have given guys a deal of a short sentence to curb some activity. If he goes to an American prison and is not heard from again, what is his legacy? In terms of influence, he is up there with Pablo Escobar. But if he goes to prison in America, he will not have a dramatic exit, as Escobar did. My guess is that if he is sent to an American prison, U.S. authorities will do everything in their power to flip the guy and turn him into an informant. They have done it with other drug lords. And that could alter how he is perceived. Right now part of his persona is that he is all-powerful. But to see him humiliated or turned into an informant might change that perception."

That's the message of his campaign: He's the only senator who stood and fought against amnesty, Obamacare, and Planned Parenthood. His finest hour was the defeat of immigration reform three years ago. Democrats wanted to give illegal immigrants a path to citizenship. Cruz said no. He took on the establishment and won. It's a good story, and the immigration fight tells us a lot about Cruz. But the fight didn't happen the way he says it did. Cruz didn't marshal the opposition or even take a firm stand. He's a lawyer, not a leader. He chose his words exquisitely so that down the road--say, in a future campaign for president--he could position himself on either side of the immigration debate. And he delivered, with angelic piety, speeches that he now claims were lies. Cruz told his version of the story last month at a campaign debate in Las Vegas. The ""battle over amnesty,"" he said, was ""a time for choosing."" In that battle, Cruz stood with Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama to secure the border. Sen. Marco Rubio, Cruz's Republican presidential rival, stood on the other side, colluding with Democrats to push ""a massive amnesty plan."" ""I have never supported legalization,"" Cruz told the debate audience. In fact, he asserted, ""I led the fight against [Rubio's] legalization and amnesty."" I've studied nearly every word Cruz uttered during the immigration showdown. I've put it together in a timeline that runs from January 2013, when Cruz was sworn in, to the end of June 2013, when the Senate passed the bill. The timeline, which you can read here, shreds Cruz's mythical account. But it also paints an unsparing portrait of how Cruz--who has now clawed his way to the front of the Republican presidential pack--thinks and operates. Here's what really happened and who Cruz really is. In January 2013, when Cruz entered the Senate, he held the same view he espouses today. The proper way to deal with the millions of undocumented immigrants in this country, he said, was to ""enforce the laws."" That meant barring them from employment and deporting them. Democrats wanted to offer these people a legal route to stay and earn U.S. citizenship. Cruz opposed that idea. Such a concession, he argued, would reward lawbreakers and punish honest people who were waiting to immigrate legally. In late January, a bipartisan group of eight senators--four Democrats and four Republicans, including Rubio--issued an immigration reform proposal that included a path to citizenship. Cruz could have ruled that provision out, but he didn't. For months, he expressed ""deep concerns"" about it but made no commitment. He cautioned that a path to citizenship would alienate many Republicans. But when reporters asked Cruz the yes-or-no question--""Would you vote against anything that has a path to citizenship?""--he refused to answer. One plausible reason for Cruz's reticence was that he wanted changes in immigration policy. He favored tighter borders, better enforcement, and an easier process for law-abiding applicants. He might be able to get those things in a deal. Furthermore, a path to citizenship was popular. In polls, more than 60 percent of Americans endorsed the idea, depending on how the question was phrased. Even self-identified Republicans supported it. So politics and policy told Cruz to keep his options open. But principle--fairness to legal immigrants and respect for the rule of law--stood in the way. Cruz was in a tough spot. But there was a way out: Undocumented immigrants could be offered something less than citizenship. They could be given a path to ""lawful permanent resident"" status--a green card--that would let them live and work in the United States. They would be allowed to stay but not to vote. Many Republicans liked this idea. It also scored well in polls. When Americans were asked to choose between creating a path to citizenship and creating a path to permanent residency, many preferred the latter. By offering green cards instead of deportation, conservatives could mobilize a national majority against citizenship. Still, Cruz had a problem with the green-card idea. Under the proposed immigration framework, green cards would lead to citizenship. And that, Cruz explained, ""worries me,"" because ""if we pass something that allows those here illegally to achieve citizenship, it means you're a chump for having stayed in your own country and followed the rules."" By late April, Cruz had worked out a solution. By permanently barring undocumented immigrants from citizenship, Congress could punish them and respect the priority of legal immigrants. In that context, as an inferior status, green cards were acceptable. At a Judiciary Committee hearing on April 22, 2013, Cruz urged his colleagues to pass legislation that foreclosed citizenship but would ""ensure that we have workers who are here, out of the shadows, able to work legally."" Two days later, in an interview aired on CBS, he said, ""There probably could be a compromise"" on undocumented immigrants ""if a path to citizenship was taken off the table."" In May, Cruz spelled out his compromise. He offered an amendment that would deny citizenship to anyone who had entered the United States illegally. One stated purpose of the bill, Cruz noted, was ""to provide a legal status for those who are here illegally, to be out of the shadows. This amendment would allow that to happen. But what it would do is remove the pathway to citizenship, so that there are real consequences that respect the rule of law and that treat legal immigrants with the fairness and respect they deserve."" Legal status without citizenship, Cruz argued, was ""reform that a great many people across this country, both Republican and Democrat, would embrace."" On May 21, the Judiciary Committee rejected Cruz's amendment. But he didn't give up. He reintroduced the amendment in the full Senate. In one venue after another--a forum at Princeton University, a speech on the Senate floor, an interview with the Washington Examiner--he made his case that the green-card compromise would grant ""legal status"" while still imposing ""consequences."" Even after the Senate passed the bill without his amendment on June 27, Cruz continued to explain that he had offered to accept green cards, not citizenship, because ""there needs to be some consequence for having broken the law."" That's a short version of what happened in 2013. Cruz moved on to other issues, and the bill never came up for a vote in the House. There's more to the story, and we'll get to that. But let's consider what we can assess so far. Three elements of Cruz's current story about the immigration fight are clearly false. First, it's not true that he embraced a ""time for choosing."" Cruz postponed his immigration decision as long as possible. He refused to answer point-blank questions about whether he could accept a path to citizenship. When he finally came out against it, he did so in the context of offering a path to legal status. Even at the end of May 2013--four months after the immigration reform framework was unveiled, five weeks after the bill's text was finalized, and a week after the Judiciary Committee passed it--Cruz still refused to say whether he would vote for the bill if it included his amendments. Second, it's not true that Cruz ""led the fight"" against amnesty. On April 21, 2013, three months after the path to citizenship was announced, Politico reported that Cruz still hadn't ""yet decided whether to become the face of the opposition."" The article noted that Cruz had ""repeatedly avoided talking to reporters"" about the bill and ""was instead focused on fighting gun control legislation."" A year later, Politico detailed how House members had organized the opposition. The story said Cruz wasn't even one of the most active senators. In November, PolitiFact, a project of the Tampa Bay Times, re-examined the record and ""found no evidence that he [Cruz] should get credit for stopping the bill from reaching a vote in the House. During the summer of 2013, Cruz was one of many voices in the Senate opposed to the bill. It was House Republicans who blocked the bill, and they were already calling for its defeat."" Third, it's not quite true that Cruz fought ""shoulder to shoulder with Jeff Sessions,"" as Cruz puts it. It's certainly not true that their positions were ""identical."" Cruz and Sessions served together on the Judiciary Committee. Both men offered amendments to the bill. Sessions' amendments proposed to restrict access to green cards. Cruz's did not. This is important, because Cruz now claims that his alliance with Sessions proves that he never supported legal status for undocumented immigrants. And that leads us to two more difficult questions. One is: Did Cruz support legalization? An ordinary person, after reading the narrative presented here, would probably say yes. But Cruz and his aides insist that he never explicitly embraced legalization. And they're right. No matter how carefully you study the timeline of Cruz's statements, you'll never catch the Texas senator endorsing--as opposed to conceding--legal status for undocumented immigrants. On May 21, 2013, he told the Judiciary Committee that his amendment would ""allow that to happen."" On May 31, when he was asked whether he would ""grant"" green cards or ""move"" people from illegal to legal status, he replied: ""That would be the effect of the amendment."" On June 11, he attributed legalization, under his amendment, to ""the underlying bill."" Again and again, Cruz chose language that implied an offer of legal status but technically avoided responsibility for it. Today, Cruz touts this record as proof of his innocence. To understand why, you have to watch his interview with Greta Van Susteren on Dec. 18, three days after the Las Vegas debate. Van Susteren reads from a letter issued by Cruz and three other senators on June 4, 2013. The letter faults the Judiciary Committee for rejecting ""an amendment (Cruz 3) that would have allowed immigrants here illegally to obtain legal status--to come out of the shadows and work legally--but not to be eligible for citizenship."" Van Susteren, like any normal person, reads this sentence as a tacit endorsement of legalization. But Cruz points out that allow doesn't necessarily mean support. He insists: ""The letter says Rubio's bill gives them legal status. It doesn't say my amendment gives them legal status."" Cruz thinks this distinction vindicates him. He proudly tells Van Susteren: ""Greta, truth matters. I have never once supported legalization."" But what's striking in the interview, in the letter, and throughout Cruz's statements in 2013 and in 2015 is how carefully he parses words such as supported, legalization, and truth. Cruz doesn't think like a normal person. He thinks like a lawyer. For him, truth isn't a matter of plain meaning. It's a matter of technicalities. That's why nobody can prove Cruz endorsed legalization in 2013. Like a crime scene without fingerprints, Cruz's verbal record is a work of art. On Dec. 15, the Washington Post's Fact Checker, unable to pass judgment on Cruz's account of the 2013 fight, surrendered to his ingenuity, explaining: ""Cruz positioned himself in a way so that he would appear pro-legalization if an immigration overhaul passed--or appear anti-legalization if hard-liner stances became more acceptable."" But Cruz doesn't just deny that he supported legalization. He denies that his amendments were serious at all. He now claims that every measure he proposed in 2013--to tighten border security, streamline legal immigration, and close the path to citizenship--was a ploy to sabotage the bill. To appreciate the audacity of this claim, you have to watch the speeches Cruz delivered three years ago. At a Judiciary Committee hearing on May 21, 2013, Cruz pleaded for ""bipartisan agreement and compromise,"" declaring, ""I don't want immigration reform to fail. I want immigration reform to pass."" On May 29, he assured Washington Examiner reporter Byron York, ""My objective was not to kill immigration reform, but it was to amend the Gang of Eight bill so that it actually solves the problem."" And on May 31 at Princeton, Cruz told his former professor, Robert George: ""I believe if the amendments I introduced were adopted, that the bill would pass. And my effort in introducing them was to find a solution that reflected common ground and that fixed the problem."" Now Cruz says he was faking it the whole time. He says everyone knew he was just trying to sabotage the bill. But that's not true. Many conservatives believed him. York, in his write-up of the May 29, 2013, interview, took Cruz at his word. George, in his public conversation with Cruz, also took the senator seriously. And in a Fox News interview on Dec. 16, just after the Las Vegas debate, Bret Baier made clear that he wasn't in on the joke, either: Baier: It sounded like you wanted the bill to pass.
Cruz: Of course I wanted the bill to pass--my amendment to pass. What my amendment did--
Baier: You said the bill.
Cruz: --is take citizenship off the table. But it doesn't mean--it doesn't mean that I supported the other aspects of the bill, which was a terrible bill. And, Bret, you've been around Washington long enough. You know how to defeat bad legislation, which is what that amendment did ... Van Susteren, in her conversation with Cruz two days later, seemed baffled: Van Susteren: You are now saying that the whole purpose of the amendment back in 2013, that you put on, was a poisoned pill. It was meant and designed to kill the whole bill.
Cruz: And it succeeded. ...
Van Susteren: And your strategy, just so we're clear--your strategy was to put this poisoned-pill amendment--
Cruz: That was actually five amendments that were all designed to defeat this. These people--York, George, Baier, Van Susteren--aren't stupid. They work in the thick of conservative politics. What confounds their ability to understand Cruz isn't ideology or intelligence. It's artifice. Normal people can't sustain a facade of earnestness for months. Normal people don't lecture others about good faith while lying and conspiring. To live a sane life, you have to assume that the people with whom you interact are, to some extent, real. York, George, Baier, and Van Susteren are normal. Cruz is not. If Cruz was faking it in 2013, consider the extent of his deceit. He didn't just put on performances for his colleagues in the committee and on the Senate floor. He requested an interview with a conservative publication, ostensibly to clear the record, and lied to its reporter. He went to his alma mater and feigned sincerity to his mentor in front of an audience of students. And he didn't stop when the Senate passed the bill. In an interview with the Examiner on July 1, 2013, and again in an interview with the Texas Tribune on Aug. 21, 2013, Cruz cited his legalization offer as evidence that he was willing to compromise. Was the whole thing a ruse? Only Cruz knows. But the rest of us can draw a few conclusions. First, Cruz is a spectacular liar. If he wasn't lying about his motives in 2013, he's lying about them now. That's not speculation; it's a distillation of the only two logical possibilities. Cruz's current performance is just as straight-faced as his 2013 performance, which he now dismisses as fraud. If Cruz told the truth to York and George--if his 2013 amendments were for real--then in the past month, he has lied to Baier, Van Susteren, and many other reporters, not to mention the public. Second, Cruz got through the entire immigration fight without leaving any solid evidence that he was faking it. That's remarkable. Last month, FactCheck.org asked Brian Phillips, a Cruz campaign spokesman, whether he could ""point to any instances in which Cruz tipped his hand"" that the 2013 legalization offer ""was not a plan he [Cruz] actually proposed, but was a legislative strategy to make a point."" Phillips said he couldn't. ""We were not trying to let on our legislative strategy,"" Phillips explained. But Cruz's 2013 record is so pristine, so perfectly devoid of nods and winks, that it's impossible to know what his real game was. And that's what sets Cruz apart. Lots of politicians lie. Cruz did something more impressive. He talked and talked and still managed to leave himself both options: to deny in the future that his amendments were sincere, or to claim that they were. Press aides on Cruz's presidential campaign, and at least one person who worked for him in the Senate, say his offer of legalization without citizenship was never serious. But there are two clues they can't explain. One is Cruz's insistence that his amendment adhered to conservative principles. Throughout the 2013 debate, Cruz emphasized that by imposing sufficient ""consequences"" on lawbreakers, his ban on citizenship made green-card legalization acceptable. He was preparing a rationale that could justify a deal. The second clue is that Cruz also prepared himself politically. Maybe it was assumed in Cruz's Senate office that his amendments were fake. Maybe Cruz even said so in private, for what that's worth. But outside the office, Cruz did something that doesn't fit that story. He poll-tested legalization in his own state. On June 19, 2013, Cruz gave a long radio interview to Rush Limbaugh. Today, Cruz claims that this interview turned the tide against the immigration bill. That's false: A week after the interview, the Senate passed the bill, 68 to 32, and--as Cruz repeatedly argued at the time--the bill, as written, was already doomed in the House. But during the call, Cruz said something curious. ""We polled Hispanic voters in Texas,"" he told Limbaugh. ""We asked, 'Do you support a pathway to citizenship or work permits that do not allow citizenship?' And a plurality, 46 percent of Hispanic voters in Texas, supported a work permit without citizenship. And only 35 percent supported a pathway to citizenship."" Cruz brought up the poll to quote the numbers. But what's far more interesting is the structure of the poll question, who asked it, and where. This wasn't a public survey. It was conducted by Cruz's own pollster, a month after the senator's election and just before the start of the immigration debate. So the question was written to be useful to Cruz. And the question didn't pit a path to citizenship against the no-legalization, border-security policy Cruz now claims to have stood for. It pitted a path to citizenship against a different option: ""Give them work permits to allow them to work here legally but do not make them eligible for U.S. citizenship."" Cruz loved the question. Between June 19 and July 1, 2013, he quoted its results at least three times. The point, he argued, was that Hispanics were on his side. But that explanation left three puzzles. One puzzle was: If Cruz wanted to prove that Hispanics were on his side, why did he ask them about work permits instead of border security? Why would Cruz poll-test a policy of letting undocumented immigrants ""work here legally""--and brag about the positive results six months later--if he weren't seriously considering it? The second puzzle was: Why Texas? If the survey were designed to influence other lawmakers, the logical sample would have been voters nationwide. Instead, the question was asked only in Cruz's state. And the third puzzle was the timing. In December 2012, Cruz wasn't facing an election. He was facing a decision about how to handle immigration. For me, these two clues--the poll and the ""consequences"" argument--show that Cruz was serious about legalization. First, he checked out the political benefits and risks in his own state. Then he spent at least two months preparing a public rationale for a deal. But if I'm wrong--if Cruz was never open to work permits or green cards--that's much worse. It would mean that Cruz polled Hispanics to find out whether, by pretending to offer legalization, he could divide and neutralize them. We can't know what Cruz really thought. And we don't need to know. From the record assessed here, we've learned enough about him to decipher his words and predict his behavior. He's a passionate, indefatigable liar. He speaks with the cadence of a preacher but the craft of a lawyer. When the time for choosing comes, he keeps his options open. Don't let his vehemence fool you. Watch every word he says. When you study Cruz this way, through the lens of history, his pretense of clarity dissolves. Last August, he ducked questions about undocumented immigrants, saying ""we can have a conversation"" about that after the border is secured. In November, he issued an immigration plan that said nothing about a path to citizenship or green cards. When reporters asked Cruz whether he would rule out legalization, he changed the subject. Cruz has also revived his rationale for a legalization deal. On Nov. 30, at a campaign stop in Iowa, Kasie Hunt of MSNBC asked Cruz to define amnesty. Cruz answered: ""I consider amnesty to be forgiving the law-breaking of those who come here illegally, and having no consequences, and in particular a path to citizenship."" These specifications--""no consequences,"" ""in particular a path to citizenship""--give Cruz space to accept a path to green cards and deny that it's amnesty. Three times, Hunt asked Cruz the logical follow-up question: ""Is a path to legalization amnesty?"" Cruz turned and walked away. In the Las Vegas debate on Dec. 15, Cruz tried to silence the doubters. ""I have never supported legalization,"" he proclaimed. Rubio, unsatisfied, pressed him: ""Do you rule it out?"" The time for choosing had come, and Cruz was ready. He turned to Rubio, raised an index finger for emphasis, and vowed: ""I have never supported legalization, and I do not intend to support legalization."" I do not intend. There's nothing more Ted Cruz than that. See the definitive timeline of what Ted Cruz said and did during the 2013 immigration debate.

7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/jeb_bush_is_deeply_disliked_by_republican_voters.html	"It is not difficult to see why Jeb Bush is losing this presidential election. He is the wrong man in the wrong cycle. Republican primary voters are rewarding passionate, fiery, outsider, ""anti-establishment"" candidates who paint their visions in broad strokes rather than pesky details. Bush is the very picture of a Republican establishment and his donors the very image of donor-class Republicanism. Though he claims not to be ""an expert on the ways of Washington,"" he is vying to be the third consecutive Republican president named Bush. He is a conservative technocrat animated less by angst and more by, say, education funding models. Anti-immigration sentiment is dominating this primary, and immigration has long been Bush's chief weakness in the primary. He's a bad fit for the 2016 Republican Party, and barring some deus ex machina that switches every current coursing through the Republican primary electorate, he will soon have little rationale for continuing his run. What's more difficult to figure out, though, is why Republican primary voters seem to dislike the guy so much. It's one thing not to support Bush's candidacy or not to respond to his style of politics. It's another to act as though the man personally beat up you and your entire family and then stole your television. And your dog. Gallup is not polling horse-race preferences this year, but it is still measuring candidate favorability. And it finds Bush's favorability so poor that it's published a lengthy post that can best be summed up as OMG you guys, check out how much they dislike Bush! Bush's net favorability rating, according to Gallup's two-week rolling average, for the first time sits in negative territory at -1, with 44 percent viewing him favorably to 45 percent unfavorably. That would be a so-so figure if the sampling included the full spectrum of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. Barack Obama, for example, has been camped out in such a position for years. But this just measures Bush's figures among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. It is the lowest net figure among the nine candidates Gallup measures. Gov. John Kasich, who has run a campaign strategy of loudly telling conservatives to cut the crap, is second-worst with a +5 rating. The other seven candidates' net favorability ratings range between +23 and +45. It's not that Bush's number is staying flat, either. He is trending downward, from +27 in mid-July to this current, lowly state. Let's look at New Hampshire, where Bush and his super PAC have been expending vast amounts of time and money. There is some sign that the onslaught has worked, according to Public Policy Polling's most recent survey, but it's not nearly enough. ""Bush has gone from negative territory last month (38/45) to positive ground (44/42),"" PPP writes. ""It may not sound like much but it's been a long time since we found Bush with an above water favorability anywhere."" The +2 is still well below the net ratings in the state for Bush's rivals in the establishment lane, Sen. Marco Rubio, Gov. Chris Christie, and Kasich. And Bush's campaign and super PAC combined have spent $23 million in New Hampshire on advertisements, mostly devoted to improving Bush's image rather than attacking rivals. Bush has a -24 favorability rating, with 29 percent viewing him favorably and 54 percent viewing him unfavorably, among voters of all stripes. That makes sense. Democrats dislike Bush because he is a Republican and the brother of George W. Bush, whom Democrats view as a very poor president. When I've seen Bush address conservative audiences, he gets the reception you might expect from Republicans who may have appreciated his work in Florida and think the dude himself is alright but aren't excited about his presidential candidacy. He's comfortable fielding questions and answers them well enough, to mostly conservative satisfaction and to polite applause. There's no animus or tomato-chucking. Maybe they just have good manners in public. Is it the immigration thing? Bush and Rubio have roughly the same history and position on immigration, but Republican voters view Rubio very favorably, even if his actual polling numbers haven't correlated to his satisfaction. Is it the establishment ties? Christie is a more moderate candidate who's viewed quite flatteringly by Republican Wall Street donors, but his favorability numbers have turned around dramatically over the last few months. Is it the last-name thing? There may be more to this, since few voters of any kind are especially excited about the coronation of a third Bush. But George W. Bush is remembered fondly enough among Republican voters that there's now chatter about how bringing out the former president might be the best and only way to save Jeb's campaign. Maybe it's unfair that voters despise Bush in a way that seems ... disproportionate to the man himself. But turning his favorability around is the first order of business before the real business of markedly improving poll numbers can be discussed. And it is already Jan. 8."

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/donald_trump_s_insurgent_candidacy_has_been_fueled_by_chinese_driven_job.html	"Who do Republicans have to thank for the rise of Donald Trump? In a very funny way, the answer is the People's Republic of China. No, I don't mean to suggest that Trump is a literal Manchurian candidate, brainwashed by members of a shadowy Communist conspiracy to bring down American democracy from within. But take a look at the regions where Trump's support is strongest, as well as his popularity among white men with a high school or lower education, and you'll see a clear pattern. Trump's America is the America that's been hardest hit by Chinese-driven deindustrialization. Over the past several months, the billionaire real estate developer has electrified Republicans by focusing his presidential campaign almost exclusively on immigration. If there is one thing that GOP primary voters know about Trump, it is that he intends to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and that he will somehow strong-arm Mexico into paying for it. If there's another thing those voters know, it's probably that Trump favors barring Muslims, or at least some Muslims, from entering the U.S. ""until we can figure out what's going on""--the centerpiece of his first TV campaign advertisement. But Trump has also drawn attention to the U.S. trade deficit with China, shaking a metaphorical fist at the Asian superpower since at least 2011. And as of this week, according to a report by Maggie Haberman of the New York Times, Trump is calling for a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports. Though Trump insists that he is ""a free trader,"" he argues that China's trade practices are so egregiously unfair that the U.S. has little choice but to retaliate. The candidate's detractors will no doubt see his China-bashing as another example of Trumpian buffoonery. Most students of U.S.-China trade will tell you that both countries benefit from the flow of goods and services across the Pacific, and that although China is guilty of imposing nontariff barriers, subsidizing its exporters in violation of global trade rules, and failing to respect the intellectual property rights of U.S. entities, the pros for American investors, workers, and consumers massively outweigh the cons. There is a problem with that view, however. Regardless of the effect of Chinese import competition on the U.S. economy as a whole, there is no question that its impact on some regions, and some groups of workers, has been devastating. Everyone understands that free trade will be a boon to some and a burden to others. But it is the job of government to ensure that the ""losers"" from Chinese import competition are given the help they need to adjust to global economic integration. And it seems pretty clear that our government hasn't done this job terribly well. Back in 2013, David Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon Hanson published a stunning paper analyzing the impact of Chinese competition on local labor markets in the U.S. from 1990 to 2007. Regions that bore the brunt of this competition saw higher unemployment, lower labor force participation, and reduced wages. Manufacturers that found themselves competing with Chinese imports shed jobs, and some were forced to shut down altogether. Interestingly, the decline in wages triggered by the surge in Chinese imports was primarily observed outside of the manufacturing sector. As employment levels and wages fell in the hardest-hit regions, average household earnings fell too. Inevitably, families in these regions were forced to rely on unemployment, disability, and in-kind medical benefits, among other transfers. The negative impact on employment was particularly pronounced for noncollege-educated adults. In preliminary work, Autor, Dorn, and Hanson have found that by reducing male employment opportunities, rising Chinese import competition may have contributed to falling marriage rates and a sharp increase in the share of children raised in low-income households. These communities have seen many other problems that the authors don't directly address, from high levels of child maltreatment and drug abuse to sky-high suicide rates. Hopelessness and despair are a familiar fact of life in Trump's America. Does this mean that the U.S. would have been better off had we walled ourselves off from Chinese imports, or had we imposed Trump-style 45 percent tariffs decades ago? I seriously doubt it. Yet it is striking to consider just how indifferent Republican and Democratic elites have been to the devastating effects of deindustrialization. Ryan Avent, drawing on the work of economists Doug Campbell and Ju Hyun Pyun, has observed that between 1990 and 2002, the dollar had an effective appreciation of 49 percent, which in turn led to a spike in relative unit labor costs in the U.S. This spike alone accounts for much of the decline in manufacturing employment. Where were the voices calling on the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to intervene in foreign-exchange markets to protect the interests of America's manufacturing sector? They were presumably drowned out by the voices calling for policies that would protect the interests of the financial services and real estate sectors. Of all the wackadoo ironies of Trump's emergence as tribune of America's white working class, the strangest of all is that as a billionaire real estate developer, Trump made his fortune in the most corrupt, coddled, and cronyist sector in the modern American economy. One of the reasons the consequences of deindustrialization were ignored by policymakers for so long is that they were masked by the housing boom. Rising home prices stimulated development and home renovation, which in turn generated employment for at least some men with high school or lower education--a disproportionately large share of whom were young immigrants and second-generation Americans living in the Sun Belt, not middle-aged whites languishing in the Rust Belt. I have no idea if Donald Trump is going to win the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary or if he'll go on to the win the Republican presidential nomination. What I do know is that when Trump bashes China, he is speaking to the anguish of millions of Americans who've long felt ignored. The failure of other Republicans to recognize that same anguish, and to do something meaningful about it, is a moral stain on the GOP. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."

9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/donald_trump_is_questioning_if_ted_cruz_s_canadian_birth_makes_him_eligible.html	"Sen. Ted Cruz passed Donald Trump in the RealClearPolitics average of Iowa polls on Dec. 12. One would have expected Trump on Dec. 13 to begin questioning whether Cruz's Canadian birth would make him ineligible to be president. Instead, he waited all the way until the first week of January to begin whispering (by which we mean saying constantly at rallies, on television, and on Twitter) about the ""precarity"" of Cruz's situation and the trouble it could bring for the Republican Party if Cruz is its nominee. And now that it's happening at long last, well, it's sort of brilliant. The question of Cruz's ""natural born citizen"" status has been assigned to the catchall category of ""birtherism,"" but it's a much different situation than the birther charges against President Obama that Trump spearheaded years ago. The prevailing birther theory held that President Obama was born in Kenya. As evidence for this theory, the birthers had nothing beyond their own stupidity and prejudice. (Typing that, though, will make it likely that I receive hilarious emails about the questionable pixelation on White House uploads of President Obama's long-form birth certificate. So be it.) In Cruz's situation, everyone agrees about the facts of Cruz's birth. Is Cruz a ""natural born citizen"" who's eligible to serve as president? In short: yes. Cruz was born in Canada and lived there until age 4. As two former solicitors general, Neal Katyal and Paul Clement, wrote in an article for the Harvard Law Review in early 2015, ""All the sources routinely used to interpret the Constitution confirm that the phrase 'natural born Citizen' has a specific meaning: namely, someone who was a U.S. citizen at birth with no need to go through a naturalization proceeding at some later time."" The Congressional Research Service backs up this understanding. And wee baby Ted Cruz was a U.S. citizen at birth. Those born abroad between 1952 and 1986 earned U.S. citizenship at birth if their parents were married and one parent was a U.S. citizen who spent 10 years in the United States with five of those coming after age 14. Cruz's parents were married, and his mother meets the citizenship requirements. The only uncertainty about Cruz's eligibility is that the Supreme Court has never ruled on the meaning of the Constitution's ""natural born citizen"" clause. There is a slim possibility that some Democratic goon--hello, Alan Grayson!--could file suit against Cruz's eligibility, the case could make its way to the Supreme Court, and a majority of justices could, just for kicks, decide that ""natural born citizen"" does not mean U.S. citizen at birth but something else. I personally rate the chances of this happening at negative 10 trillion percent, since the suit's success would rely on a ridiculous legal argument and the conservative Supreme Court disqualifying the Republican Party's presidential nominee. But it's that slight, slight chance that Cruz's eligibility may be imperiled that Trump is sinisterly and shrewdly playing to. He is not running around saying There's no way that Cruz is eligible!, which is usually how he rolls. He is saying that Cruz has a responsibility to the party to clear himself through the courts in the event he wins the nomination. ""How do you run against the Democrat, whoever it may be,"" Trump said on CNN Wednesday, ""and you have this hanging over your head if they bring a lawsuit?"" Trump, bless his heart, is even offering Cruz a remedy through which to prove his eligiblity: Cruz has been laughing this all off in public. It wouldn't be surprising, however, if the Cruz campaign is thinking through this more seriously in private. Trump hasn't put Cruz in a corner just yet but has put him in, shall we say, a spot. Many Republican primary voters, in large part because of Cruz and Trump's rhetoric this campaign, are inclined to pick up on and feel unnerved by even the smallest whiffs of foreignness. Recall that Cruz, after news of his dual citizenship came out, renounced his Canadian citizenship in 2014. Why did he do that? I, for one, would love to have the option of a second citizenship in Canada, especially depending on the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. But Cruz perceived his Canadian citizenship as a political liability, and now Trump is reinserting the words Cruz and Canada into the news cycle. Obviously Republican primary voters aren't thinking straight about electability concerns just yet, considering that Trump and Cruz are running first and second in most polls. But Republicans want the White House badly after eight years of President Obama and the prospect of even one minute of Hillary Clinton. The fear of something, however improbable, happening to the Republican nominee ahead of the general election and ""handing"" the race to Clinton is a nagging one. It's also worth considering how the rest of the political world has met Trump's hypothesizing. Cruz has a lot of enemies: his rivals for the nomination, Republicans in Congress, Democrats in Congress ... pretty much everyone. All of this is well deserved, because Cruz uses every person and institution around him as a prop for his own personal advancement. When Trump started talking about Cruz's birth this week, he was not universally condemned, as he usually is when he says something strange. There's been a surprisingly broad range of actors fanning Trump's statement. Sen. Rand Paul, who believes Cruz is a phony who's stealing his libertarian-leaning votes, first joked in a Fox News Radio interview Thursday, ""I think without question [Cruz] is qualified and would make the cut to be prime minister of Canada."" But then: ""I'm not an expert on the natural-born clause in the Constitution and people have various opinions. ... And we've had some previous cases of it, but I don't think we've ever gone through the court system for the Supreme Court to decide one way or another."" Sen. John ""Panama"" McCain, who hates every atom in Cruz's body, joined in on the trolling too, calling the question of Cruz's eligibility ""legitimate."" Ann Coulter, one of the rare figures who's gone from being a 2012 Romney shill to a 2016 Trump shill, is on a rampage about how Cruz is not a natural born citizen. And don't expect Democrats to get in the way of Republican ""birthers"" devouring themselves, either. Cruz will treat the questions of eligibility as laughable until he can't, and that point may be coming. Maybe he will end up seeking the declaratory judgment that Trump, ever the pal, has counseled him to seek for his own good. But it would be humiliating, and Trump knows that.

10	10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/why_marco_rubio_is_promising_to_hold_a_constitutional_convention_if_elected.html	"Sen. Marco Rubio needs conservatives, or at least, the deep red voters who are currently parked behind his immediate rival, Sen. Ted Cruz. Without them, he's stuck in the middle of the pack, and far behind in states like Iowa, where those conservatives dominate. But Rubio is in a bind. He's running as a conservative who can win, with a campaign aimed at the general election. Which means that he has to temper his rhetoric; he can't indulge the red meat and factionalism of candidates like Cruz without risking his appeal as the most electable Republican in the race. Instead, he has to send quiet signals and speak to more esoteric concerns. And last week, he did as much with a pledge to put ""the weight of the presidency"" behind a constitutional convention. ""One of the things I'm going to do on my first day in office is I will put the prestige and power of the presidency behind a constitutional convention of the states,"" said Rubio at a recent campaign stop in Waterloo, Iowa. ""You know why? Because that is the only way that we are ever going to get term limits on members of Congress or the judiciary and that is the only way we are ever going to get a balanced-budget amendment."" First, some background. Under Article V of the Constitution, two-thirds of states can apply to Congress to convene a constitutional convention. Overall, scholars agree that the states would have to draw boundaries on the scope of the gathering. This process is so difficult that it's never happened. And in general, calls for constitutional conventions have always lived on the fringes of American life, like in the 1960s, when some conservatives called for a convention to overturn liberal Supreme Court decisions. The most mainstream movement for a convention was to draft and pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution in the 1970s and '80s. Thirty-two states supported it--two votes short of the 34 needed to succeed. With that said, calls for a convention have gained a little more traction in the past five years. On the left, a small group of scholars and activists want a new convention to limit the power of money in politics. On the right, a larger and more influential group of activists want a convention to craft new amendments for term limits and a balanced budget amendment. Rubio is speaking to the latter, and they like what they hear. ""Rubio endorses Convention of States,"" tweeted conservative radio host Mark Levin, an advocate for the move. ""Will the other GOP contenders support it as well?"" Likewise on Twitter, Mark Meckler, former Tea Party leader and president of a group advocating for the convention, said Rubio could earn conservative support with this move, calling it a ""game-changer"" for his campaign. Rubio isn't moving this initiative to the center of his campaign, so it won't be a game-changer. But it could help on the margins, and convince a few skeptical conservatives that the Florida senator is on their side. With that said, we should step away from the horse race aspect of this and note the extent to which everything here is a bad idea. A successful constitutional convention requires a level of consensus and judicious thinking that doesn't exist in modern American politics, at least not in great quantities. And this is underscored by the nakedly ideological demands for term limits and balanced budgets. The former robs Congress of experience and expertise, and empower actors--lobbyists and interest groups--who have the time and money to fill the gap. The result isn't more accountability--it's a weaker legislature that can't think beyond the short-term. And a balanced budget amendment is just a recipe for disaster, tying the government's hands in the face of wars and economic crises. As ideas, they are more about sentiment--we want to shrink government--than they are about solving problems. On that score, it's worth noting that this renewed push for both measures comes at a time the United States is becoming younger, browner, and more liberal. For a movement whose electoral health is tied to an aging population of white conservatives, it's increasingly now or never for right-wing ideologues, or at least, moves that block liberals from achieving their goals. The sense that the moment is slipping explains why, on a different bank of the Right, conservative legal scholars are pushing a return to the pre-New Deal Lochner regime. If winning national elections is difficult given your shrinking coalition--and if that coalition is the main constituency for movement conservative ideology--then the next best option is to change the rules of the game. A constitutional convention is one way to reach that goal. The other, should you win the White House, is a well-placed judicial appointment."

11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/middle_east_expert_karim_sadjadpour_on_saudi_arabia_s_relationship_with.html	"Last week, the government of Saudi Arabia executed Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, a Shiite cleric who had protested against the regime. Forty-six other people were also put to death on ""terrorism-related"" charges. The Sunni monarchy that runs Saudi Arabia has a long and poor record of dealing with the country's Shiite minority, but the brazenness of this execution, amidst Sunni-Shiite conflicts in Syria, Bahrain, Iraq, and Yemen, was shocking to both the country's allies and adversaries. Indeed, the country's principle adversary, Iran, encouraged or allowed a number of its citizens to attack the Saudi embassy in Tehran. The Iranian government also does not have a great record on the death penalty or sectarianism: It not only backs Bashar al-Assad's Sunni-massacring dictatorship in Syria but also executes more people than any country on Earth besides China. In response to the embassy attack, Saudi Arabia cut off diplomatic relations with Iran; a couple of Saudi allies have now done the same. For some insights into all of this, and the broader turmoil in the region, I called up Karim Sadjadpour, an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment who is an expert on Iran and the Middle East and who used to be based in Iran with the International Crisis Group. We discussed America's relationship with Saudi Arabia, why ISIS has very few true enemies in the Middle East, and whether the Sunni-Shiite split is fixable. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity. Chotiner: Some analysts have suggested that Saudi Arabia and Iran are in a sense seeking out this crisis because it is helpful for hard-liners in both countries. Do you agree with that analysis? Sadjadpour: I sometimes think we ascribe too much strategic forethought to governments in the Middle East. I don't share the view that Saudi Arabia had a sophisticated regional strategy in executing Sheikh Nimr. They were executing about four dozen Sunni radicals, which was going to alienate some segment of society. So they executed a few prominent Shia at the same time. So there was no broader strategic thinking? It was a pretty big decision. I think when you look at the arenas where Saudi Arabia and Iran are in conflict, whether Syria or Bahrain or Lebanon or Yemen or Iraq, Iran has an upper hand. When you look at it in a broader regional context, the increasing prevalence of sectarianism benefits Saudi Arabia because they have more numbers. Eighty-five percent of the region's Muslims are Sunni. For the Saudis, if sectarian politics outweigh anti-imperialist politics, that is beneficial. But at the same time, we are not talking about a Saudi government run by Wahhabi Kissingers or Brzezinskis. This government does not have a deep bench of strategic thinkers. They are not playing a game of chess. It's interesting that you think Iran is doing better in these conflicts even though the region is overwhelmingly Sunni. Why? Is the Iranian regime smarter or more strategic? We have to look at each situation in its own context. In Iraq, there is a Shia majority. But that certainly isn't the case in Syria, where the Alawites only represent 15 percent or so of the population. But Iran has now almost 40 years of experience building militias in the Middle East, starting with Hezbollah. They have a committed ideology and worldview. They have a very clear goal in Syria, which is the continuation of the Assad regime. The Saudis don't really have a clear alternative worldview, and they have often been compromised by the fact that they are aligned with the United States. It's tough for them to win an ideological battle. It's easier to win a sectarian one. Do you think the Saudi regime is in an especially weak place now, with oil prices so low and with the Iranian nuclear deal? I am not sure they are feeling existential angst at home. Four or five years ago, people had romantic thoughts about the Arab Spring. Now I don't think many Arabs watching television think popular uprisings will be successful. So except for the Shia population in the East, there are no signs that they feel they have to quell a popular uprising. Oil prices are trouble, but they have billions more in reserves than Iran. But in the region it has been a time of humiliation for them. In today's Middle East, everyone feels like they are the oppressed victim. Shiites have long felt repressed. But now Sunnis feel that way. Self-pity is always so helpful in situations like this. And you do have a non-Sunni president dropping barrel bombs on a largely Sunni population in Syria. Absolutely. The Saudi population watches television every night, which shows Sunnis being massacred by an Iranian-supported president. Were you surprised by the Iranian reaction? Given how many embassies Iran has ransacked, I don't think that was uncharacteristic either. When you say ""Iran has ransacked,"" I assume you think this was done at the urging, or with the consent, of the regime. If there were a group of 50 Iranians who got together to protest the government's human rights or labor rights practices, they would be crushed in a matter of minutes. Nonsanctioned protests in Iran are now rare. Policemen in Iran were told not to interfere. Starting with the U.S. Embassy in Iran in the 1970s, and continuing with the Saudi and Kuwaiti embassies in the following decades, there is a precedent. Someone joked that no government hates embassies more. Yeah. Do you think this was part of an internal power struggle between the president and hard-liners? President [Hassan] Rouhani is not in charge of the Revolutionary Guards. He is a protege of former President Rafsanjani, who was long an advocate of better Iran-Saudi relations. So I have no doubt that he did not order or approve this. It is detrimental to the interests of his government, which is trying to open Iran up to business. The hard-liners benefit. Are you optimistic about Iran normalizing relations with the West and America? And are the Saudis rightly worried about this? The Saudis have long had an inferiority complex. The paradox of Iran and Saudi Arabia is that the Saudis have a superiority complex vis-a-vis the Shia and an inferiority complex vis-a-vis the Persians. The Saudis have long felt that America favors Iran and that Obama has less respect for Saudi Arabia. I think there will be normalization between Iran and Europe, but as long as the supreme leader remains in power, I don't think Iran and American will normalize relations. But many gulf rulers think the rapprochement has already taken place, whether it was the U.S. removal of Saddam [Hussein], or the refusal to attack Assad. That is a mainstream conspiracy theory in the gulf. Are you surprised by how quiet the Obama administration has been over the past week? Countries often choose allies based on shared values, whether those values are tolerance or free-market economics. Saudi Arabia is an ally who doesn't share our values. Except about executing people: us, Iran, Saudi Arabia. Yeah, Iran is No. 1 per capita. What, if anything, do you think the United States could be doing to minimize tensions? I just read a piece that said we should abandon Saudi Arabia and commence an alliance with Iran. And yet the Saudi government wants to ally with the United States, and Iran's official slogan remains ""Death to America."" I think Obama and [Secretary of State John] Kerry would love to normalize relations, but it takes two to have an alliance. As for what we can do now: The Obama administration doesn't want to do anything to mess up the nuclear deal. We have long been a bulwark against Iran but have said that other regimes should do some of the work. But now that the Saudis have, in Yemen, it is doing more damage than good. It's a dilemma with no good answers. The United States, and especially John Kerry, has worked tirelessly to get Iran and Saudi Arabia in the room to discuss peace regarding Syria. How has the past week changed the odds of success? Before this week, I would have given the odds of success 4 out of 10. Now I would say it's 3 out of 10 or 2 out of 10. There is an old proverb that states when two elephants fight, the grass suffers. The people who are most going to be hurt are Syrians, Yemenis, Iraqis, Lebanese. They are living through the proxy war. Where does this end? Is sectarian violence just going to get worse? If you look over the past four decades, 40 years ago the most notorious terrorist group was considered to be the PLO. Then Hezbollah made the PLO look moderate, and then came al-Qaida, which made Hezbollah look moderate. And now we have ISIS. The trend lines haven't been in positive directions. Sectarianism wasn't as prominent an issue three decades ago. Journalists who covered the Lebanese civil war would say that they didn't know who was Sunni or Shiite. ... There is a notion that the Saudi-Iran sectarian war is fueling all these conflicts. I think the reality is the opposite. You have these regional conflicts, which have their own dynamics, and are driven by many of the factors that led to the uprisings in Tunisia and elsewhere. Saudi Arabia and Iran are on opposite ends of those conflicts, and exacerbated them. But when there aren't regional conflicts, such as in the 1990s, there was a relatively peaceful modus vivendi between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Iran and Saudi Arabia will always be competitors, but they aren't destined to be sectarian adversaries. One of the main reasons we are allied with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states is anti-terrorism. And yet none of these states seem all that concerned about ISIS. They often seem more concerned about Houthi rebels in Yemen and hate Assad much more than ISIS. The spread of ISIS poses much more of an existential threat to the Gulf states than it does to Iran. Iran is a country that is 90 percent Shia. And ISIS has provided Iran a useful pretext to expand its influence. The dilemma that Saudi Arabia faces is that its citizens watch television images of Sunnis being slaughtered, and it is tough for them to side with Iran. Sure, but you could say the Taliban poses a bigger threat to Pakistan than India does, and yet Pakistan supports the Taliban. Countries aren't always rational. It is often difficult to distinguish between official government funding and private citizens. I have seen no evidence that the Saudi government is actually providing money to ISIS or al-Qaida. But yes, Saudi Arabia hates Iran more than it hates ISIS. The conventional wisdom is that ISIS is a radical Sunni group that is being funded by Sunnis in the gulf and opposed by Iran. But Iran is the arsonist and the fire brigade. Iran's support for Assad and the [Nouri al-]Maliki government in Iraq led to many Sunnis supporting ISIS. It will have to be Sunnis who put out the ISIS fire. So Shia militias won't do it? They pour more gasoline. It's hard to find countries in the Middle East that truly want to see ISIS disappear. Assad probably doesn't--it's his lifeline. And the Gulf states don't. Everyone has bigger enemies."

12	12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/ted_cruz_is_moving_to_donald_trump_s_right_on_immigration.html	"Sen. Ted Cruz has offered a gift to the political media that's constantly trying to goad him and Donald Trump into fighting: He apparently doesn't think that Trump is sufficiently anti-immigration. Cruz, while greeting voters, was captured on video Monday in Iowa explicating an immigration policy difference with Trump. ""Both you and Donald Trump are really strong on immigration, but he supports deporting all the illegal immigrants,"" the questioner says. ""Are you willing to say the same?"" ""Absolutely, yes,"" Cruz says. ""We should enforce the law."" Here, he seems to leave a little space open for the ""self-deportation"" that dominates his immigration plan rather than the more forceful mass deportation that Trump supports. Not that immigration activists regard either as particularly humane. But then, on his own volition, Cruz leapfrogs to Trump's right: ""And in fact, look, there's a difference. He's advocated allowing folks to come back in and become citizens. I oppose that."" He then name-checks Congress's two most cherished anti-immigration conservatives, Rep. Steve King and Sen. Jeff Sessions, as collaborators on his immigration plan. Here's the video, plucked by BuzzFeed: Cruz is mostly correct about Trump's position, if you believe that the latter's off-the-cuff riffing constitutes a policy position. Trump has stated, as Cruz does in the video, that he supports deporting all 11 million undocumented immigrants residing in the United States. But he also has said that he would allow the ""good ones"" to then return after deportation to obtain ""legal status""--not citizenship, as Cruz claims. Like many Trump positions, the policy itself matches the thought process through which it was deliberated almost verbatim: Well we have to get rid of all of them, because illegal immigration is bad, but that doesn't sound very nice at all, so we will let the good ones back in, though not to be citizens. How's that? Cruz, who spent much of 2015 gushing about how ""grateful"" he was for Trump's contribution to the immigration debate, has decided to attack Trump as a supporter of amnesty. This is a few things. First, it's amazing. Trump, who has gone so far as to call for a ban on Muslims' entry into the country, will now be portrayed as insufficiently ""tough"" on immigration. It's also a nice check of how far Cruz, in his effort to keep up with (and now surpass) Trump's rightward lunge on immigration, has moved to the right on this issue in the past year. When Cruz entered the race, he was already far right on immigration. He has since moved further, rejecting even the slimmest possibility that he might consider a plan granting legal status to undocumented immigrants, as well as renouncing his previous support for increasing legal immigration levels for skilled workers. Trump and Cruz both support eliminating birthright citizenship, too, for what it's worth. This is not Rick Perry and Michele Bachmann desperately trading aspersions into the void about the other's secret love for undocumented immigrants. We are talking about the two leading Republican candidates who capture a majority of voters' support between them and have the two clearest paths to the nomination, less than a month before voting begins. The simplest forecast for how the next two months will play out is that these two trade wins in the early states and the dozen or so Southern contests that follow, while Sen. Marco Rubio bides his time and waits for something to happen on more favorable, winner-take-all grounds. ""Waiting for something to happen after losing early states"" has never been a winning strategy, and if a Rubio, Jeb Bush, or Gov. Chris Christie thinks he could at least pluck off a Massachusetts, he should take a look at this. Politico on Tuesday offered its latest update about the ""establishment,"" a term we use loosely to describe Republicans who believe that a Trump or Cruz nomination would mark the party's electoral Armageddon, losing its mind over the probability of a Trump or Cruz nomination. Mitt Romney is making calls! Well-connected operatives are once again mulling a Stop Trump campaign! They have ""offered detailed presentations"" of said campaigns! They are correct to be worried, especially since there's not much more they can do. So let's make them feel even more lowly: It's going to get much worse if Trump and Cruz end up fighting against each other for the largest chunk of the electorate down the stretch. Cruz has indicated that he will jump to Trump's right on immigration, which will likely cause Trump to move to his own right, against any eventual legal status, to maintain his anti-immigration base. From there, the two leading candidates for the nomination will have taken extremely severe positions against immigration reform, though they will bicker about how the other is weak nevertheless. And so the race to the bottom extends for several more months. This is a hackneyed observation, but I'm going to make it again because it tickles me: Imagine telling the RNC in 2013, when its ""autopsy"" of the 2012 election stated that the party must champion comprehensive immigration reform in order to win the presidency, that the nomination would likely come down to Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz, and that it would be fought over immigration and who can take the most rejectionist stance. Cruz, oddly enough, subscribes to the official GOP strategists' theory that the Republican presidential candidate must win 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in order to secure the presidency, compared to the 27 percent Romney earned in 2012. He argues that he can do so because most Hispanic voters don't vote based on immigration reform. That may be true, but the sentiments that such hard-line anti-immigration messages inspire (and are catered to in the first place) turn off many, many Hispanic voters from hearing anything else the GOP may want to say. Perhaps Cruz is relying on his last name to do the trick. It would really be helpful to the Republican Party if a candidate not named Trump or Cruz won New Hampshire. A quick look at the scene there suggests that all the establishment-acceptable candidates are destroying each other. In that case, never mind. Read more of Slate's coverage of the GOP primary."

13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/the_oregon_standoff_with_ammon_bundy_isn_t_evidence_of_a_racial_double_standard.html	"In April 2014, Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy made headlines when he (and his armed allies) stood off against federal law enforcement in a dispute over private grazing and public lands. On Saturday, his son Ammon Bundy did the same. But this time, the standoff is in Oregon, over land that has nothing to do with the younger Bundy. This Bundy--along with an unknown number of armed militiamen--have seized and occupied the headquarters of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge near Burns, Oregon, on behalf of two local ranchers, Dwight and Steven Hammond. In 2012, both Hammonds were convicted of committing arson on public lands after a decade of legal battles over fires started in 2001 and 2006. The federal government owns three-quarters of the land in Harney County, where the Hammonds reside, and its land sits near theirs. The first fire, according to the Hammonds, was a burn meant to remove invasive juniper from public land near their ranch. But federal prosecutors say this was a cover. The real reason, they argued, was to cover up evidence of the illegal slaughter of deer. A second fire in 2006 violated a citywide burn ban, and threatened the lives of volunteer firefighters in the region. In 2010, prosecutors indicted the father and son on federal arson charges, and in 2012, they received a five-year sentence under the federal Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.* In appeal, lawyers for the Hammonds argued that the mandatory minimum for arson under the law was unconstitutional ""cruel and unusual punishment,"" and a trial court agreed, reducing the sentence. Last October, however, an appeals court struck the prior ruling and reimposed the mandatory sentence, with credit for time served. After spending months in prison, the Hammonds had to return to serve the rest of their sentences. Which brings us back to Ammon Bundy. Both Nevada and Oregon are states where the federal government owns and manages huge swaths of land. And in those places, right-wing and anti-government activism is often centered on land-use disputes. Indeed, there's a long history of political conflict over public land. The ""Sagebrush Rebellion"" of the 1970s and 1980s, for example, pitted western ranchers, miners, and other private actors against the Bureau of Land Management over land that was newly marked for conservation and other public use. Ammon Bundy, like his father, comes out of the same milieu that spurred the Sagebrush Rebellion and continues to inspire resistance to federal land control. The Hammonds, then, are a cause celebre for Bundy and his supporters (which include his brother, Ryan), who intend to make a stand even as the Hammond family declines their assistance. ""What we're doing is not rebellious. What we're doing is in accordance with the Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land,"" he said on Saturday. ""We're out here because the people have been abused long enough, their lands and their resources have been taken from them to the point that it is putting them literally into poverty,"" said Bundy to reporters on Sunday. The group has weapons, and as Bundy told CNN, ""If force is used against us, we would defend ourselves."" His goal is to turn this federal land over to local ranchers, loggers, and other interests. Because we live in an age of immediate amplification--and because this involves a Bundy--the Oregon standoff is a national political story. But these issues are hyper-regional (and a little esoteric) and don't lend themselves to quick soundbites and instant reactions. You see this in the measured responses from Sens. Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, who commiserated with the Cliven Bundy ranchers in the past. ""Every one of us has a constitutional right to protest, to speak our minds, but we don't have a constitutional right to use force and violence and to threaten force and violence on others,"" Cruz told reporters on Monday. ""I'm sympathetic to the idea that the large collection of federal lands ought to be turned back to the states and the people, but I think the best way to bring about change is through politics,"" said Paul to the Washington Post. If there's a broad issue to come out of the Oregon standoff, it's around the use of force. As with Cliven Bundy, local and federal law enforcement has taken a wait-and-see approach to Ammon Bundy and his militia supporters. The FBI has called for a ""peaceful resolution"" to the confrontation, and announced its concern for the safety of ""both those inside the refuge as well as the law enforcement officers involved."" To observers on Twitter, this caution was galling, especially after a year of highly visible police violence against unarmed black Americans and political fear-mongering over Muslim refugees to the United States. ""Let's be clear,"" said columnist Cenk Uygur, ""If Muslims had seized a federal building, they'd all be dead by now #whiteprivilege #OregonUnderAttack."" Likewise, thousands of people retweeted an image of an armed militiaman captioned ""150 armed white men take over a federal building and threaten violence if removed--Not a single shot is fired at them"" followed by a photo of Tamir Rice with the caption, ""12-year-old black boy plays with a toy gun--is gunned down in less than two seconds without as much as a warning."" It's easy to see why both tweets struck a chord. But it's also worth noting the extent to which the Rice shooting--and many others--are fundamentally different from that of a standoff between armed fanatics and federal law enforcement. It's not just that these are different organizations--local and city police forces versus the FBI and other federal agencies--and different kinds of confrontations with different procedures, but that there's also a different history involved. Confrontations at Ruby Ridge and in Waco, Texas, ended with scores of dead (white) civilians, and inspired the Oklahoma City bombing--the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil prior to Sept. 11, 2001. Law enforcement has been willing to use lethal violence against armed white protesters and the results were catastrophic. It's no surprise federal agents are cautious; they walk with the hard-learned lessons of the 1990s. Even if the Bundys are paper tigers, no one wants to relive the past. In that, law enforcement officials are correct. In any case, why won't they shoot at armed white fanatics isn't just the wrong question; it's a bad one. Not only does it hold lethal violence as a fair response to the Bundy militia, but it opens a path to legitimizing the same violence against more marginalized groups. As long as the government is an equal opportunity killer, goes the argument, violence is acceptable. But that's perverse. If there's a question to ask on this score, it's not why don't they use violence, it's why aren't they more cautious with unarmed suspects and common criminals? If we're outraged, it shouldn't be because law enforcement isn't rushing to violently confront Bundy and his group. We should be outraged because that restraint isn't extended to all Americans. *Correction, Jan. 6, 2016: This article originally misidentified Dwight and Steven Hammond as brothers.

Various candidates, with the key exception of Donald Trump, are offering a message of serious leadership, a trait either that too many candidates possess for voters to decide among them or one about which few voters care. The message serves as both a lament over the decidedly unserious nature of the 2015 leg and a hope for a better stretch in 2016: Either voters will come around to valuing seriousness as voting nears, or Trump will be the Republican presidential candidate. Trump on Monday released his first television advertisement, which can best be described as an actualization of the hilarious thought experiment, What if the archetypical ""somber-voiced political ad narrator guy"" tried to speak like Donald Trump? It is what it is. The ad will earn exponentially more airtime in free media coverage than the hard-dollar New Hampshire buy allots for, reinforcing Trump's theory that paid media is a waste for a candidacy like his. But it is not the only new message out on Monday. Gather 'round, family, for the Rick Santorum campaign has scrounged together enough loose change to produce a television ad. It goes after Iowa front-runner Sen. Ted Cruz, who is depicted reading stories to his children on the Senate floor. ""Ted Cruz is wonderful at reading children's fairy tales on the Senate floor,"" the narrator begins, even though Green Eggs and Ham is not a fairy tale. ""Rick Santorum spent his time in the Senate a little differently."" The ad mentions how Santorum was on the Armed Services Committee for eight years, wrote a law imposing sanctions on Iran, and other superserious things that Iowa voters won't care about because they like Cruz better. ""If you want to protect America and defeat ISIS, Rick Santorum's your president,"" the ad concludes. ""Because serious times need serious people."" One of Cruz's amply funded super PACs, Keep the Promise 1, released an ad Monday that does to Sen. Marco Rubio what Santorum does to Cruz: Unfairly cherry-picks some footage of the candidate in a lighter moment to prove that he's not serious enough to be America's war president. The ad overlays the usual scary footage of armed foreign people with commensurate scary music and asks, ""What would Marco Rubio's leadership look like?"" It then shows a clip, originally shot for a dumb Web video the Rubio campaign released in October, of Rubio making his fantasy football picks. Vote Ted Cruz: As president, he will not enjoy a single moment of levity. (Rubio, for his part, attacked Cruz in New Hampshire on Monday for not being serious enough to spend infinite amounts of federal money on bomb procurement or to spy on every American all the time.) Jeb Bush will also begin running a new ad in New Hampshire on Tuesday. It, too, shows scary pictures of terrorists, over which our man says, ""serious times require serious leadership""--almost identical to the lame slogan in Santorum's ad. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, like Santorum, is a previous winner of the Iowa caucuses. And Huckabee, like Santorum, is losing pitifully this year as novice candidates like Cruz and Ben Carson suck up Iowa's social conservative vote. ""This has been, of all the election cycles I've been involved in, this has been one of the most bewildering,"" Huckabee, per the Des Moines Register, said at a Sunday event, ""because it's almost as if the more experience, the more preparation one has had for this job, it's almost like it's a detriment than it is an asset."" Huckabee should feel especially offended, since he has experience as both a longtime governor and a conservative entertainment personality who's constantly spouting off attention-grabbing nonsense. But his venting of frustration at the oddness of this cycle harkens back to New York magazine's Jonathan Chait's description of the process in September, after Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker dropped out: ""The Republican presidential race has appeared to take the form of a kind of reverse meritocracy, in which the candidates with real political accomplishments (Walker and, before him, former Texas governor Rick Perry) are driven out, and novices with strong television skills rise to the top."" This remains the dynamic of the race, as Trump, Cruz, and Rubio, who have zero hard political accomplishments between them, sit atop the field. And Rubio is the least likely of those three to win the nomination, largely because he committed the heresy of almost accomplishing something serious and noteworthy. What is ""seriousness""? It doesn't necessarily have to go hand in hand with ""political experience,"" and when political candidates urge voters to select the ""serious"" choice, they always just mean, ""select me."" I would say that ""seriousness"" connotes an understanding of the job of president and a fluency in major policy issues. What we have this cycle is a front-runner who's both politically inexperienced and visibly unversed in major policy issues--something that's hurt Carson, but not Trump. There must be something the non-Trump candidates see while crafting their messages about ""seriousness"" that's not apparent to the naked eye. It's a message that hasn't worked this cycle, but they continue offering it. Maybe they're hoping that once voting begins, voters en masse will think, ""Oh God, am I really going to push a button that says 'Donald Trump' today?"" Or they've just got nothing better to suggest. It's much easier when the electorate cooperates."	What If Republican Voters Don't Value Seriousness Anymore?	['Carson', 'Cruz', 'Rubio', 'Trump']	[]

Never VEEP! Takes down the flag--bad! So Donald Trump's Twitter feed will likely proceed in the next 24 hours once he gets word about the South Carolina governor using her official State of the Union rebuttal to make a surprising political maneuver. Though she did not attack Trump by name, her swipe at the Republican presidential front-runner was clear. The speech--after first establishing for the Red Team that, yes, of course, the current president's record is garbage--pivoted to a vague attempt at humility: Republicans may not be perfect either. ""We need to be honest with each other, and with ourselves: While Democrats in Washington bear much responsibility for the problems facing America today, they do not bear it alone. There is more than enough blame to go around,"" she said. ""We as Republicans need to own that truth. We need to recognize our contributions to the erosion of the public trust in America's leadership. We need to accept that we've played a role in how and why our government is broken."" She then described her childhood as ""the proud daughter of Indian immigrants"" and added that, ""growing up in the rural South, my family didn't look like our neighbors."" ""My story,"" she went on, ""is really not much different from millions of other Americans. Immigrants have been coming to our shores for generations to live the dream that is America. They wanted better for their children than for themselves."" Was there some pressing reason why she felt the need to reinforce the idea that immigrants are, indeed, good?

While the legislative stakes might be low, the political stakes are much higher. Obama's address comes with the first voting of the 2016 election--one that will ultimately make or break his political legacy and the policy direction of the country--just a few weeks away. In what is already a heightened political season, the speech will offer pundits and politicos from both sides of the aisle one more way in which to frame the upcoming nominating- and general-election fights.

17	17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/what_obama_needs_to_say_in_his_state_of_the_union.html	For the past two years, Barack Obama has used the State of the Union to outline an ambitious domestic agenda: infrastructure investment, job training, funding for scientific research, comprehensive immigration reform, clean air regulations, education reform and greater funding for schools, higher wages, paid sick leave, free community college, and equal pay for women. A solid agenda, from the perspective of liberals and Democratic activists. But also a pipe dream. Since 2011--and especially since 2015, when Republicans won Senate control--divided government has meant inertia for Obama's agenda in Congress. Anything Obama wants--and specifically, anything that might advance liberalism--is a dead letter to the conservative Republican majority on Capitol Hill. In a real way, his State of the Union addresses were wish lists for a future when Democrats controlled the federal government, full stop. A presidential wish list, however, is still valuable. It's where the president sets priorities for himself and his party, and it's a helpful guide for other party members--from state politicians to national activists--as they plot a course for policy and political action. But just because it's valuable doesn't mean it's necessary. And this year, for his final State of the Union, President Obama should set the wish list aside. It's not just that his agenda can't succeed in the present environment but that Democrats already know what he wants. At most, another wish list would serve to remind his party, and the country, of past proposals and renew old calls for action. Instead of a wish list of policy, Obama should use the nation's attention on Tuesday to make a pitch--for his legacy. This would be a bit of a departure from the typical final year State of the Union of a two-term president, which--as is the form--tends to tout accomplishments, push new measures, and close with some note about America's greatness. Implicit, often, is a pitch for a like-minded successor. But, for understandable reasons--the State of the Union is not meant to be a partisan exercise--it's left unspoken, even as polarization adds an ideological edge to the entire event. That implicit partisanship is in everything from the customary response by the party out of power, to the punctuated applause of co-partisan lawmakers and the conspicuous silence of political opponents on the other side. Making the partisanship explicit in the speech would just be making subtext text. Moreover, Obama would have good reason for the move. If the 2012 election was a referendum on Obama's first term, then 2016 is shaping up as a generational choice for the American public. Does it want to continue, refine, and expand Obama's liberalism? Or does it want to build a new foundation for future conservatism? The intense polarization of modern electoral politics--where the gap between the most conservative Democrat and most liberal Republican is far wider than any gap within their respective parties--means less continuity when the White House passes hands (at least on domestic policy). The pendulum swings, for real. In the same way that 2008 brought a real reorientation of government across legislative, judicial, and regulatory spheres, a GOP presidency would do the same in 2017, from a long-term conservative majority on the Supreme Court--the kind that might undo decades of liberal rulings--to a largely unified conservative majority that would repeal key parts of the Obama agenda--and change any congressional rules necessary to make it happen--and reshape the government's relationship to ordinary Americans. Which is to say that, if a Democrat isn't elected this year, much of Obama's legacy is lost, either to legislation, executive action, or judicial review. Put differently, nothing Obama proposes will matter unless there's a president in 13 months who shares basic parts of his worldview. Obama shouldn't side-step or talk around this. He should address it, head on. Not only should he tout his administration for what he sees as its successes, but he should tell the American people that--if they liked his tenure--they should look for a like-minded successor. And he doesn't need to endorse either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. He just needs to make clear that his agenda depends on a Democratic president in 2017. This will cause consternation; the president would be breaking a norm. But for Obama, any blow to political decorum is worth the clarity of a partisan State of the Union. The stakes are high, and if Obama believes a GOP president would threaten his legacy--and every indication says he or she  would--then he should say so, to the American people.

18	18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/the_republican_party_may_not_be_big_enough_for_donald_trump_and_paul_ryan.html	"COLUMBIA, South Carolina--I have never covered so much distance in such a short time, traveling from one corner of the Republican big tent to the other. Last Friday, I attended a Donald Trump rally in Rock Hill, South Carolina. More than 6,000 people filled a basketball arena at Winthrop University, right up to those last seats obscured by championship banners. It was a like a revival, but the outbursts from the crowd were not the sounds of new conversions. They were denunciations of the heretics--the weak, the politically correct, the Chinese, those with low poll numbers, Hillary Clinton, and hecklers who had interrupted and were removed like ticks. Saturday, I attended the Jack Kemp Foundation poverty summit in Columbia, 70 miles to the south. It was hosted by House Speaker Paul Ryan and Republican South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott. The crowd filled the neatly arranged ballroom seats and listened patiently as GOP presidential candidates offered their ideas about how conservative principles could help those most in need. The Republican Party hopes to come together after the primary race of 2016. It's going to require some really strong sutures. The noisy part of the party and the governing part of the party are far apart on fundamental issues like trade, national security, budgeting, and immigration. And the loud voices supporting Trump are suspicious and angry about just the kind of compromises, temporizing, and patience that the joining of two halves requires. One way to think about the split is to consider the difference between Trump and Ryan. Trump is the phenomenon of the grassroots, and Ryan is the best hope of the GOP's governing wing. Ryan believes in public service. He has been involved in public affairs essentially his entire adult life. The Kemp forum opened up with Jimmy Kemp, the son of the late congressman, talking about public service as a calling. This year in the GOP presidential race, anyone who has devoted his or her life to public service in politics is at a serious disadvantage. Trump has leveraged the disappointment with the elected class into a huge lead in the polls. Ryan also believes in quiet work to understand a problem. As he said during the afternoon, ""I learned from my mentor Jack Kemp and my other mentor Bob Woodson ... that the only way to really know poverty is to try and walk it through people's footsteps, to learn from people struggling."" The poverty summit was the product of weeks Ryan spent traveling the country after the 2012 election learning more about the issue. He did it quietly. No one knew what he was doing until he'd completed the tour. When he quizzed the candidates, he wanted to know if they'd done this kind of homework. Trump is the opposite. He is proud of his outsized personality and public relations stature--he's not going to go off and toil in anonymity. He eschews the kind of detailed experience-based study Ryan was talking about. He believes he can get up to speed quickly on issues. The conversation at the poverty summit was at times quite detailed. Ben Carson talked easily about literacy rates and the reading programs he'd set up across the country. Several candidates praised the educational improvement tax credit program and talked about its expansion. Ideas for the best tax rates, incentives, and work requirements were discussed. There wasn't much policy at the Trump gathering other than his call and response with the crowd about making the Mexican government pay for the wall he's going to build on the southern border. There was a physical aspect to this hunger in the Trump crowd. Protesters rose and were ejected to the rising roar of the crowd. Some were aggressive and seemed to be asking to create a spectacle. Others were not, such as one woman wearing a hijab who simply stood there but was shouted down and manhandled out of the room. After a few ejections, Trump expressed nostalgia for the way protesters used to be able to be handled--much more roughly. ""I like the old days better,"" he said. That could be a tag line of his campaign as he promises a return to the days before political correctness and elites fouled up the country everyone was promised. Meanwhile, back at the Kemp forum, the closest it got to confrontation was when Arthur Brooks, the president of the American Enterprise Institute, talked about using free enterprise to be ""warriors for the poor."" Progressive poverty experts have plenty of criticisms of Ryan's free-market approach to poverty and those the GOP candidates put forward: They say conservatives' excessive reliance on the states will lead to unequal treatment of the poor; the budget cuts proposed by candidates will devastate programs that are actually helping the poor; and the GOP work requirements are useless if there aren't also policies to help the millions of working poor who have jobs but need the protections of a consistent schedule, paid sick days, and paid family and medical leave. Is the existing welfare system really a trap if food stamp assistance is being shown to improve educational outcomes in the next generation? Those are the kinds of debates that can take place if Ryan is successful in putting poverty on the agenda. Without his efforts, the Republican Party is on track to not discuss these issues at all in the 2016 primary. ""I think it's a mistake that's been made,"" Ryan told me on Face the Nation:"	How Big Can the Republican Tent Be?	['Carson', 'Paul', 'Trump']	[]

He also claims that an amendment he offered, which would have permanently barred these immigrants from citizenship, was designed to kill the bill. Is he telling the truth? Here's a detailed timeline of what Cruz said and did during the debate, with links to videos and other contemporaneous evidence. Jan. 3, 2013: Cruz is sworn in as a U.S. senator from Texas. Jan. 7: In a PBS NewsHour interview, Cruz is asked what should be done with people who are in the United States illegally. He answers, ""We should enforce the laws with respect to those who are here illegally now."" Jan. 28: Eight senators, including Marco Rubio of Florida, issue a ""Bipartisan Framework for Comprehensive Immigration Reform."" The plan vaguely proposes a ""tough but fair path to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants currently living in the United States."" In a short statement, Cruz says, ""I have deep concerns with the proposed path to citizenship."" He argues that ""such a path is both inconsistent with rule of law and profoundly unfair to the millions of legal immigrants who waited"" to enter the country properly. This statement begins a pattern: Cruz offers two arguments against a path to citizenship--fairness and the rule of law--but declines to rule it out, instead expressing ""deep concerns."" Feb. 20: Speaking in Dallas, Cruz says President Obama's focus ""on amnesty, a path to citizenship that skips ahead of the line"" is ""not a position that will achieve bipartisan cooperation."" But the Dallas Morning News reports, ""Cruz did not directly answer whether he supports potential citizenship for illegal immigrants already here."" March 21. In an interview at Cruz's Washington office, Todd Gillman of the Morning News asks Cruz, ""Would you vote against anything that has [a] path to citizenship?"" Cruz replies: ""I have deep, deep concerns about a path to citizenship for those who are here illegally."" Gillman points out, ""But there are Republicans--Marco Rubio, Rand Paul--moving towards, 'OK, we'll take that as part of a package.'"" Cruz declines to take a clearer position, repeating: ""I have deep concerns about any path to citizenship."" March 28: The Pew Research Center publishes a survey, taken March 13-17, 2013, in which Americans are asked to choose between two ways ""to handle immigrants who are now living in the U.S. illegally."" Only 27 percent choose this option: ""They should not be allowed to stay in the country legally."" Seventy-one percent choose the other option: ""There should be a way for those who meet certain requirements to stay in the country legally."" But when the 71 percent are asked whether the legal status should be citizenship or ""permanent residency"" without citizenship, one-third of them--24 percent of the entire sample--choose permanent residency. This confirms that opponents of citizenship can muster a political majority by offering permanent residency, known as a green card, instead. April 1: In a radio interview, Sean Hannity asks Cruz: ""What about those who would [offer] a path to a green card? Would you support that if the border was secured first?"" Cruz answers: ""Well, the problem with the green card is, the green card is a permanent legal residence status, and anyone who has a green card is eligible for citizenship within five years. And so if someone can get a green card, that is a path to citizenship. And it worries me ... [that] if we pass something that allows those here illegally to achieve citizenship, it means you're a chump for having stayed in your own country and followed the rules."" This is the first time Cruz has been asked the green-card question. He objects to the idea because, under current law, a green card can lead to citizenship. But again, he chooses not to say whether he could support it. April 21: In a Politico article, Manu Raju reports that ""Cruz hasn't yet decided whether to become the face of the opposition"" to the immigration bill. According to Raju, ""Last week, Cruz repeatedly avoided talking to reporters about the newly unveiled immigration plan ... saying he was still reviewing it and was instead focused on fighting gun control legislation."" Raju notes that despite Cruz's objections to a path to citizenship, in an exchange with reporters, Cruz ""avoided calling it 'amnesty,' as conservative critics are quick to do."" April 22: In a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Cruz says a path to citizenship ""jeopardizes the likelihood of passing any immigration reform bill."" Instead, he urges the committee to pass a bill that secures the border, facilitates legal immigration, and reforms agriculture ""to ensure that we have workers who are here, out of the shadows, able to work legally."" This appears to be Cruz's first use of the phrase ""out of the shadows""--a well-understood shorthand for changing laws so that undocumented immigrants can reveal themselves without penalty. April 24: In an interview aired on CBS, Jan Crawford asks Cruz, ""What would you do with the 11 million people who are here illegally?"" Cruz tells her, ""I think there probably could be a compromise on that, if a path to citizenship was taken off the table."" In the interview, Cruz doesn't clarify what the compromise would entail. May 7-8: In the Judiciary Committee, senators file amendments to the bill. The bill's staunchest opponent, Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, files two amendments that would sharply restrict access to green cards. Cruz files an amendment that does not address green cards. The Cruz amendment specifically denies ""citizenship"" to anyone who entered the United States illegally. May 9: At a Judiciary Committee hearing, Cruz assures colleagues of his good faith in offering amendments. ""I am hopeful that the majority on this committee will work--as I trust it will--in good faith to improve this bill,"" he says. He concludes: ""I don't want this bill to be voted down, and I hope the stakeholders ... will be interested in amendments to craft a bill that will pass."" May 21: Cruz presents his no-citizenship amendment to the committee. He notes that the stated objective of the bill's proponents is"	The Definitive Timeline of How Ted Cruz Deceived Everyone in the Immigration Debate	['Cruz', 'Crawford', 'Rubio']	[]

Which makes sense. Maine is among the most homogeneous states in the union, and the large bulk of Maine's drug users, drug dealers, and drug addicts are white. But don't tell that to Paul LePage, the state's Republican governor, who sees a different racial culprit for the influx of drugs into Maine. ""These are guys with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty--these types of guys--they come from Connecticut and New York, they come up here, they sell their heroin, they go back home,"" said LePage at a town hall meeting on Wednesday night. It's possible for ""D-Money"" to stand for a hypothetical white drug dealer. But that falls apart when you get to the next part of LePage's statement. ""Incidentally, half the time they impregnate a young, white girl before they leave, which is a real sad thing because then we have another issue we have to deal with down the road."" The governor didn't elaborate on what those other ""issues"" are. As soon as this hit national media on Thursday night, representatives for LePage tried to limit the damage. ""The governor is not making comments about race. Race is irrelevant,"" said Peter Steele, his communications director, in a statement to the press. ""What is relevant is the cost to state taxpayers for welfare and the emotional costs for these kids who are born as a result of involvement with drug traffickers. His heart goes out to these kids because he had a difficult childhood, too. We need to stop the drug traffickers from coming into our state."" On Friday, facing further criticism, LePage held a news conference to discuss and defend his comments. ""I spent an hour and 15 minutes talking to the people in Richmond the other night about some of the problems in Maine,"" LePage said. ""In that whole time, many of you were there, that whole time, I made one slip-up, I made one word of slip-up. I may have made many slip-ups. I was going impromptu, and my brain didn't catch up to my mouth."" He continued: ""If I slipped up and used the wrong word, I apologize to all the Maine women."" And when asked if he would apologize to Maine's black community, LePage said, ""I never said anything about white or black on traffickers."" For the LePage administration, this controversy is par for the course. Elected in 2010 with just under 38 percent of the vote in a five-way contest for the governorship, he won re-election in 2014 despite low approval ratings and a pattern of inflammatory--and sometimes vulgar--rhetoric (helped along by a divided opposition). Indeed, if LePage has a national profile, it's defined by those comments, from his campaign promise that, ""As your governor, you're gonna be seeing a lot of me on the front page saying 'Gov. LePage tells Obama to go to hell,' "" to his attacks on rivals--""Sen. Jackson claims to be for the people, but he's the first one to give it to the people without providing Vaseline."" How, then, has LePage survived--and even thrived--as governor of a famously moderate state? By harnessing the resentment of Maine's rural middle class, which is angry about welfare. When we talk about the decline of the white working class--and in particular, the dramatic spike in alcoholism, addiction, and premature death among young and middle-aged working-class white men--we're talking about states such as Maine, where slow growth and isolation have bred struggling towns where many rely on public assistance. These people--as we've seen in West Virginia and similar parts of Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and other states--don't vote. And to that point, 55 percent of nonvoters are white, 51 percent are men, 54 percent are between 30 and 64 years old, and 46 percent make less than $30,000 a year. They are estranged from the political system. The people who vote are their immediate peers, the teachers, police officers, small business owners, and city employees who hold the closest thing to middle-class jobs in these depressed areas. And they vote for Republicans. Not because they're somehow distracted by social issues, but because--as Alec MacGillis argues for the New York Times--they see assistance going to the ""undeserving benefit-recipients who live nearby."" They are angry that a neighbor collects disability when he can work, or that a young family member uses drugs and food stamps.

I'm Slate Plus editorial director Gabriel Roth, commandeering the newsletter at the end of a busy week for our membership program. Thanks to you, we've sent Seth Stevenson to Daytona Beach to report his dream story: a trip to the Wendelstedt School for Umpires. He'll be keeping members updated on his reporting through next week. And our second Slate Academy series, A Year of Great Books, launched in earnest with the announcement of our first pick: Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy. (I voted for it.) Start with Laura Miller's introduction to the book, then grab a copy, read along with Laura and Will Oremus, and discuss it with your fellow members in our private Facebook group. Speaking of Laura Miller, she filed one of my favorite stories of the week, a lovely, moving meditation on Marie Kondo's The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up and its sequel, finding genuine pathos in what I'd thought was a tedious fad. And speaking of Will Oremus, he filed a deeply researched explanation of Facebook's News Feed, the invisible product that's fast becoming the only place the world gets its information, then turned around a quick analysis of Twitter's next move as if he wasn't tired at all. Then he started reading Tristram Shandy. While you wait for your copy to arrive, here are the stories I most enjoyed in Slate this week. On the politics desk, three of my favorite writers turned in arguments of a kind I always look to Slate for: the It's More Complicated Than You Think piece. Michelle Goldberg's careful personal take on a political controversy helped me understand what Hillary Clinton means to my female peers. Jim Newell's close reading of Donald Trump's recent strike against Ted Cruz demonstrated that Trump is a much subtler operator than he's given credit for. And Fred Kaplan argued that yes, North Korea's recent nuclear test is frightening, but only if you understand a bit about North Korea's history and the regional politics of East Asia. Meanwhile, in the arts section, Ruth Graham pointed out how weird it is that we subject real-life murder cases to the entertainment-oriented dictates of ""spoiler culture."" Slate's critical round tables are always my favorite year-in-review features, and this year's Movie Club is especially good, with Dana Stevens both praising and attacking Pixar, Mark Harris being amusingly grouchy about blockbuster culture, and Dan Kois countering with the surprising greatness of Mad Max: Fury Road. Finally, I enjoyed Shon Arieh-Lerer's review of a critical biography of Groucho Marx, a book the great man ""would have found both deeply validating and kind of annoying."" I'll end this email before you start to find it both deeply validating and kind of annoying but: if you're in or near New York on Jan. 15, come hang out with Mike Pesca, host of The Gist podcast, at a special happy hour for Slate Plus members only. Fun fact about Pesca: He's exactly the same in real life.

23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/ronald_reagan_s_conservative_conversion_as_spokesman_for_general_electric.html	"Excerpted from Ronald Reagan: The American Presidents Series: The 40th President, 1981-1989 by Jacob Weisberg. Out now from Times Books. Ronald Reagan began working for GE in 1954 as a liberal anticommunist and finished in 1962 so far to the right that the company felt it had to drop him as a spokesman. This transformative eight-year period in his life remains underexamined, however, in part because it is poorly documented in comparison with the rest of his career. Nonetheless, it stands as the pivotal stretch when his mature political views and skills emerged. Reagan described working for GE as his ""postgraduate course in political science,"" the time when his conservative ideology was formed. In the early 1950s, Hollywood was threatened by the new television business emerging in New York. One of the obstacles to producing television on the West Coast was a SAG rule that banned actors from having agents who served as producers, which was seen as a conflict of interest. Reagan's agent, Lew Wasserman, wanted to produce television and had set up a separate company, Revue Productions, to do so. But to hire actors, his firm, MCA, needed a waiver from SAG, whose president, Ronald Reagan, was its own client. In 1952 the SAG board voted to give a secret ""blanket waiver"" to Revue Productions, granting it an unlimited right to produce television programs. Only six board members, including Reagan, were in on the discussion, and one of the other five was his wife, Nancy. Making matters look even worse, Reagan did this favor just after Warner Bros. dropped him, at a moment when he was seriously short of funds. He was still paying child support to Jane Wyman and private school fees for their children, Maureen and Michael. He had a new daughter and a new house in Pacific Palisades that needed furnishing, on top of a second mortgage and horses to feed at a 320-acre ranch he had recently bought in the Santa Ynez Mountains. At his low point, Reagan was reduced to emceeing a Las Vegas nightclub act in a straw hat and bow tie, a job he despised. The steady paycheck MCA found for him in 1954 was made possible by the waiver he'd granted to Revue. It was hosting a television program suggested by MCA to General Electric's advertising agency, BBDO, at a starting salary of $125,000 a year. The public aspect to his role was hosting and occasionally acting in half-hour episodes of General Electric Theater, which was broadcast Sunday nights on CBS. This anthology program was devoted to adaptations of novels, plays, and short stories, often featuring top stars such as Jimmy Stewart, Jack Benny, and Judy Garland. Over eight seasons, it became the epitome of midcentury middlebrow entertainment. On any given week, General Electric Theater might feature a crime thriller, a romantic comedy, or a dramatic fable. The program was a rapid success, becoming the third-best-rated show on television in 1956-57, lagging behind only The Ed Sullivan Show and I Love Lucy, both also on CBS. The content was controlled by GE, which wanted to avoid controversy and make sure it didn't clash with its slogan, ""Progress is our most important product."" The Reagan family was enlisted to represent the slogan ""live better electrically"" in their new, modernist ranch house, which was kitted out as a showcase for GE products. It had a retractable roof over the atrium, a heated swimming pool with underwater lights, intercoms in every room, and an elaborate lighting system that could produce a variety of colored effects. There was an electric barbecue, a refrigerated wine cellar, three TVs, three refrigerators, two freezers, two ovens, and a dishwasher with a built-in garbage disposal. The company had to install a three-thousand-pound switch box to handle the electric current. A series of three-minute commercials featured the Reagans telling three-year-old Patti about their ""electrical servants,"" such as the vacuum and waffle iron that ""make Mommy's work easier."" Dad told viewers that ""when you live better electrically, you lead a richer, fuller, more satisfying life."" The endorsement came naturally to Reagan, who regarded scientists as wizards who could solve any problem, from cancer to pollution. His broadcast presence was reinforced by his role as a goodwill ambassador for GE, spending up to 12 weeks a year touring the company's plants around the country. After World War II, GE's president, Ralph Cordiner, had delegated authority over its manifold business, ranging from household appliances to airplane engines, to 120 separate department heads. Having a visible spokesman who toured these decentralized operations would help sell the company's policies in the provinces and reinforce a common culture. Ultimately, Reagan would spend what he estimated to be two full years on the road, visiting all 139 facilities and addressing most of GE's 250,000 employees. On tour, he might deliver as many as 14 speeches a day, starting on a factory floor and finishing as the after-dinner speaker for a local chamber of commerce or Rotary Club branch. For Reagan, it was a dry run for politics. He learned how to interact with a live audience, and not just perform for the camera and microphone. He learned how to test which jokes went over and refine the way he told them. He learned how to preserve his voice and manage his energy during weeks of uninterrupted travel. He learned how to come across not as a distant matinee idol, but as a man of the people. His views were also in transition. Because he had a fear of flying, his contract specified travel by train. These trips were taken in the company of Earl Dunckel, the GE public relations man responsible for the speaking program. Dunckel, who described himself as an archconservative, later recalled long hours debating with Reagan about Truman and the New Deal. The long train rides also gave Reagan the time to read, think, and write. His reading included Witness, by Whittaker Chambers, which he is said to have virtually memorized; F. A. Hayek's The Road to Serfdom; and Economics in One Lesson, a classic of free-market literature by the journalist Henry Hazlitt. A more distant corporate influence was Lemuel Boulware, the company's chief labor negotiator, whose importance at GE was second only to Cordiner's. Boulware was known for a strategy of collective bargaining, under which the company would listen to union demands, do extensive research, and then come back with what he called a ""fair, firm offer."" According to union leaders, it meant ""telling the workers what they are entitled to and then trying to shove it down their throats."" Boulware wanted management to bypass union leadership to speak directly to workers, enlisting them as ""mass communicators for GE."" Though he had no documented interaction with Boulware himself, Reagan was spending many weeks a year in conversation with midlevel executives, plant managers, and workers steeped in Boulware's antiregulatory views. According to Dunckel, Reagan ""didn't want to be at a loss to discuss it, if they wanted to discuss it."" Over time, Reagan's speeches came to match the message from headquarters about the inefficient, irrational, and meddlesome federal government. After a couple of years, Reagan was professing concern about the ""business climate,"" a term Boulware coined, and recounting tales of ""government interference and snafus."" Now that he could no longer shelter his income through the ""temporary corporation"" loophole, high marginal tax rates were a constant preoccupation of his. It was during his years traveling with Dunckel in 1955 and 1956 that Reagan ""came to the realization that he was no longer a Democrat, that the gap had widened too far to be bridged,"" as he put it. In 1957 he returned to his alma mater, Eureka College, as graduation speaker. His speech echoed his Fulton commencement address of five years earlier: Americans were a people on a mission from God. But now his vision was less about chosen-ness than about technological progress and consumerism. Having soaked up Hayek and Hazlitt and Boulware, he warned against freedom being lost from within through ""carelessness and apathy."""

Here are our favorite stories for the week of Jan. 4: ""This Drug Can Reverse Heroin Overdoses--& It's Now Over The Counter"" by Sarah Jacoby, Refinery 29
Though one doctor said that the feeling of taking Naloxone, a drug used to treat heroin overdoses, is ""only slightly better than death,"" this piece makes the case for why the treatment is important. Addicts can make changes in their lives and contribute to society, but only if they're still alive to try. The first-person overdose accounts in this piece will make you wish that every addict had access to it. --Lily Hay Newman, staff writer ""On Being Ugly"" by Fran Hoepfner, Medium
This very odd, very touching personal essay, by a Clickhole editorial assistant, tells a lot of stories at once: of being the only woman invited to a bachelor party; of feeling ugly; of buying shirts. It's offhandedly written, an essay full of throwaway lines that somehow add up to something quite emotional. It's also extremely funny. --Dan Kois, culture editor ""On Spinsters"" by Briallen Hopper, Los Angeles Review of Books
I'm late to this review of Kate Bolick's Spinster, which came out in the Los Angeles Review of Books in July and resurfaced on a Longreads ""Best of 2015"" list in December. But I can't sufficiently recommend this beautifully written piece about the radical power of the ""spinster"" figure, who represents the value of non-normative love and community, sometimes at her own peril. --Nora Caplan-Bricker, contributing writer And from Twitter: --""If you want to know where your tax dollars go and what your government spends, here are the numbers,"" says John Dickerson, linking to a set of infographics prepared by the Congressional Budget Office. --Leon Neyfakh recommends this ""great piece"" about prison programs designed to get people out of long-term solitary confinement. --Melinda Wenner Moyer tweets: ""This excellent piece by Christie Aschwanden explores why claims in nutrition are often spurious."" --He's probably being a little hyperbolic, but Stephen Metcalf really did call this ranking, of ""The Best Rapper Alive, Every Year Since 1979,"" ""the best thing I ever read."""

25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/north_korea_s_nuclear_test_isn_t_as_dangerous_as_kim_jong_un_wants_us_to.html	"North Korea's nuclear test isn't the game changer that the country's dictator Kim Jong-un claims it to be. Contrary to his boasts Tuesday, the device tested was almost certainly not a hydrogen bomb (which can explode with thousands of times the power of an atomic bomb). It puts Kim no closer to his dream of a nuclear-tipped long-range missile. As only the country's fourth nuclear test (and the third remotely successful one), it doesn't alter the region's, much less the world's, military balance one iota. But that doesn't mean the test is nothing to worry about. Given that we're talking about the youngest, most hermetic, best armed, and possibly most megalomaniacal dictator in the world today, it means quite the opposite. Last month, to the skepticism of many, Kim announced that his scientists were ready to test an H-bomb. On Tuesday, or early Wednesday morning in North Korea, after reports of a seismic event resembling either an earthquake or a nuclear explosion, he proclaimed that they had done so. In fact, though, Western officials and physicists say that the blast registered only 5.1 on the Richter scale--the same as North Korea's last nuclear test, in February 2013--and that its explosive yield was probably a little less than the earlier blast's 7 kilotons (the equivalent of 7,000 tons of TNT, about half the power of the Hiroshima bomb at the end of World War II). What disturbs many, though, isn't any facts about the test but rather the political context surrounding it. ""This isn't about us or what we think of as geopolitics,"" says Daniel Sneider, associate director of Stanford University's Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center. ""It's more about North Korea's domestic politics and regional politics."" In recent months, Kim has reached out to China and South Korea, requesting economic assistance and expressing an interest in calmer political relations. He was told that his nuclear activities would be obstacles to progress on both scores. Some see the nuclear test as a message from Kim that harmony will come on his terms only. This stubbornness may seem odd, given that North Korea is one of the most impoverished--and the most isolated--country on earth. China is its only diplomatic ally and the source of nearly all of its aid and trade; many South Koreans, including the country's current conservative president, Park Geun-hye, desire some rapprochement with its northern neighbor. (Park said in 2014 that Korean unification, on the South's terms of course, would prove an economic ""bonanza"" for all.) But the North Korean leader--like his late father and grandfather, Kim Jong-il and Kim Il-sung, the only two previous leaders of the communist state since it was founded in 1948--depends on isolation and oppression for his reign. The question, which concerns many, is how long he can sustain this form of rule--and what actions he's willing to take, at what risk, to do so. Chinese President Xi Jinping is, by all accounts, increasingly annoyed with the young Kim's antics, especially those that involve nuclear weapons. If he wants to crack down on Kim, he has the leverage to do so--and is probably the only world leader who does. The problem (and Kim almost certainly knows this) is that China has other, deeper interests that keep Xi from exerting decisive pressure. If North Korea's regime collapsed (a strong possibility if the Kim dynasty's last heir--the regime's only source of legitimacy--were toppled), two things would likely happen. First, 10 million North Korean refugees would suddenly dash across the border to China's remote northeastern territories, creating a humanitarian crisis that would stretch Beijing's resources. Second, the U.S. Navy and Air Force could move its warships and combat planes away from Northeast Asia (as North Korea would no longer pose a threat to South Korea or Japan) and toward Taiwan and the South China Sea, thus posing a direct threat to Beijing's vital interests. Kim's father and grandfather used their incipient nuclear program as a bargaining chip, and, eventually, the West learned how to bargain. The Agreed Framework, an arms-control treaty negotiated with President Bill Clinton, halted this program for several years. But then three things happened. First, the United States reneged on its side of the deal: In exchange for North Korea's nuclear freeze (with verification by onsite international inspectors), Clinton was supposed to provide two lightweight nuclear reactors (which could only generate electrical power), but Congress didn't authorize the money. Second, President George W. Bush formally tossed out the treaty soon after his inauguration. (Nonetheless, Bush announced that North Korea would cross a ""red line"" if it resumed reprocessing; when the North Koreans did, Bush did nothing.) Finally, the Agreed Framework had one crucial flaw: It froze only North Korea's plutonium reprocessing and said nothing about enriching uranium, the other path to a nuclear bomb. (The Americans who negotiated the Iranian nuclear deal last year learned from the Korea agreement and insisted--successfully--on cutoffs or sharp cutbacks along all feasible paths to a bomb.) When President Obama entered the White House, he tried to restore long-tattered relations with North Korea, but especially after Kim Jong-un came to power in 2012, the prospects dimmed, then vanished. Even longtime advocates of diplomacy with Pyongyang acknowledge that negotiations about almost anything are pointless as long as Kim Jong-un is in power. Hard as it was to do diplomacy with the elder Kims, Western diplomats came to discern patterns, a distinct negotiating style, and figured out ways to play the game. The most nerve-racking thing about the young Kim is that the elders' rules no longer apply. ""He doesn't seem to be following any rulebook,"" says Scott Snyder of the Council on Foreign Relations, whose 1999 book, Negotiating on the Edge, laid out the rules for talking with North Korea. ""My book was relevant up to 2011. With Kim Jong-un, it isn't any more."" Another difference, Snyder says, is that the elder Kims came up with revolutionary cadres, whose counsel they could trust when they came to power. Kim has no such background (he is thought to have attended prep school in Switzerland), and he has killed all of his mentors, except for those who have mysteriously disappeared. In other words, nobody knows Kim's objectives apart from the aggrandizement of power, and it's unclear what he will do, how far he will go, to that end. That's what makes him scary--and brazen acts, such as another nuclear test, scarier than they otherwise would be."

26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/donald_trump_s_attacks_on_bill_clinton_s_extramarital_affairs_reveals_how.html	"Hillary Clinton is running for president, which means Bill Clinton's sex life is relevant again. Donald Trump mentioned it last week, jabbing the candidate and the former president in a tweet marked by his unique syntax. ""If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong!"" On Monday, citing Trump, ABC News reporter Cecilia Vega asked Bill Clinton whether his affairs were ""fair game."" The ex-president was flustered. At the Washington Post, Ruth Marcus warned Team Clinton that Bill's past behavior was a real liability for the campaign, and writing for National Journal, Ron Fournier cites ""senior Democrats"" who ""worry the old allegations will gain new legs."" This worry--and Trump's obvious bet that he can harm Hillary using Bill--might make sense if this were 2004 or even 2008. But in 2016, it's an odd--even bad--bet. Why? Because much of the American electorate is too young to care, and even if it did, political attacks don't work the way they once did. This November, if projections hold true, 31 percent of all eligible voters--68 million people--will be between 18 and 35 years old. This year's youngest voters, in other words, were born at the tail end of Bill Clinton's second term, in 1998. At most, they might remember the 2008 election. Most likely, their earliest political memory is the re-election of Barack Obama. At the other end, the oldest voters in this group might remember Bill Clinton--they were 10 or 11 when he was elected, and teenagers when he won re-election. The most conservative people in this cohort might respond to attacks on Clinton for his infidelity, but they are a minority. Americans who turned 18 when Bill Clinton was president are among the most liberal voters in the electorate. The only group more liberal are voters who turned 18 under George W. Bush. They account for most of the 68 million, and overwhelmingly backed Obama in 2008 and 2012. Will this group care about Bill Clinton's infidelity? Anything is possible. But odds are that they won't, and that Trump's attacks--along with similar jabs from other Republicans--will fall short, for the simple reason that they're too young for it to matter to their political identity. This gets to two broader points about this election. The first is that, for as much as Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush have been criticized as past-their-prime in national politics, it's also true that they're essentially unknown to large numbers of voters. A younger country means both candidates have a chance to introduce and redefine themselves, which Clinton is trying to do, hence interviews with celebrities like Lena Dunham and a forthcoming appearance on the comedy Broad City. The second is that the GOP coalition isn't just whiter than the one backing the Democrats; it's considerably older, too. If the Bill Clinton attacks make any sense, it's only as a tool for mobilizing conservative voters; after all, the typical Republican voter is closer to their 50s than their 30s, and has a clear memory of the Clinton years. This underscores the extent to which there are two separate electorates in American politics that no longer overlap. Republicans talk to one group of Americans, Democrats to another. And in turn, that illustrates one of the fundamentals of contemporary political life: Persuasion is a dead letter. You don't attack to move voters from one side to another--the ""swing voter"" has largely disappeared--you attack to boost your party. Bill Clinton's infidelity might become an issue in this election, but it won't take votes from Hillary. Instead, it will just remind Republicans why they wanted to vote against Democrats in the first place. Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."

27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/oregon_standoff_what_does_ammon_bundy_really_want.html	"The current standoff at a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon is ostensibly a dispute over grazing rights, led by an armed group that as of yet has not identified itself as a militia. But Leonard Zeskind, who has been monitoring extremist groups for many years, views the conflict as part of a larger, longer-term battle between the federal government and organized right-wing militias. Zeskind, who is the president of the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights, is also the author of Blood and Politics: The History of the White Nationalist Movement From the Margins to the Mainstream. I spoke with Zeskind over the phone this week about what the Oregon protesters want, how Donald Trump divides white nationalists, and why Black Lives Matter and other recent anti-racism activism may be inspiring a frightening backlash. The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. Chotiner: You have said that since June 2015 there has been an uptick in militia activity. Zeskind: It's not just a small uptick. IREHR has recorded a massive increase. We are paying closer attention to the growing militia phenomenon. There has been a decided white reactionary response to anti-racist activism by black folks and white folks and brown folks and people of all colors opposed to police violence. They have turned to the militias. When you say you see a rise, what do you mean exactly? How do you measure it? We monitor these formations in all possible ways. People are joining in person. We do not think this is an online phenomenon, even though these groups are definitely online. The militia movement of the 1990s was not an online phenomenon either. On the other hand, the Internet has allowed them to communicate more broadly with each other and attract followers--people who were already inclined. The online activity doesn't cause anyone to be a racist. Let's be very clear about that. Racists go online to find each other. When you look at these groups you are monitoring, is the anti-racism movement something that they admit is a motivating force, or is this your analysis of why they are joining now? Both. On our website we have a story on the shootings in Minneapolis [in which five Black Lives Matter protesters were shot]. Folks came out and shot a bunch of the people who were in the street. This is not news. It didn't happen last week. It has been building for months. How do you view the Oregon protest specifically? The thing we should steer away from is chalking this up to western grazing rights or something like that. This action stands in the line of Waco and other encampments. This is an assertion of political power by the far right. And we should understand it that way. Is there a website or reading material--intellectual traditions--that these people have for inspiration or support? They have think tanks and journals and books. Is there anything particularly notable, or is this more marginal stuff? Well, see, you trick yourself. By declaring that because most of the people you know haven't heard of it, you trick yourself into thinking it is marginal. Do you think this is a mass movement? I am asserting to you that the militia phenomenon should be regarded as a mass movement. It's not a million people. But it has a wide level of support, much wider than a couple of dozen cranks in Oregon. Do you think this movement could get political support? I run a nonprofit institute. I don't pay attention to the political parties per se. But look, since 2009, we have had a growing Tea Party movement. The Tea Party movement has done things like take over the anti-immigrant movement. It has added its support to the gun stuff. Tea Partiers have been showing up at gun rallies and burned their permits, like they were draft cards in 1967. They have demonstrated their opinion that they should have guns regardless of any laws. And some Tea Partiers are joining militias. But do you think their ultimate power is limited without political support? You seem to think they can seriously affect society without political support. That's exactly what I am saying. OK, but what form would that take? Armed standoffs. Gun rallies. I can tell you that they are organizing and planning to do things. Some commentators have noted that the rise of Trump has coincided with white nationalist fervor. Do you think his entry into the race, which was also in June, had something to do with what you are seeing? There are white nationalists who support Trump generally. There are white nationalists who support him on immigration-related issues but oppose him on his friendships with Jews. White nationalists are generally anti-Semitic, and the fact that Trump is not an anti-Semite limits his support among white nationalists. David Duke ""famously"" said he supported Trump. But he didn't say he supported Trump! Go to David Duke's website. It's my home page. Duke said he supported Trump's immigration policy. What has brought about a growth in the white nationalist movement is that they have figured out a new approach, in the age of Obama. Obama disoriented them because so many white people voted for Obama. And the Tea Party initially supplanted them in a certain way. The Tea Party is not all white nationalists. But the rise of anti-racist activities has given the racists a new focus. Look at the battle over Confederate flags. After the shooting in Charleston, there were at least 140 pro-Confederate flag rallies. There are still people that gather in groups and drive around Southern metropolitan areas in convoys with flags. And you will see more of it. There are still battles over memorials. So you seem to be saying it's less Trump than things going on in the culture. And the flag! It got lowered in South Carolina after decades of struggle, and a Republican governor came in there are lowered it. A non-white Republican governor. She got her Legislature to lower it. That was a significant blow. And then the corporations started acting. This doesn't augur well in one sense, because the culture is changing and there is sure to be more anti-racism activism. I hope so. So do I, but it seems like you are saying the backlash will be intense. Yes, but it doesn't mean we should stop being anti-racist. It means we have to increase anti-racism! We should learn how to talk to white people who live in communities where racists have hegemony. Read more of Slate's coverage of the standoff in Oregon."	What Do the Oregon Extremists Really Want?

28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/donald_trump_s_first_political_ad_wants_to_scare_people_into_thinking_he.html	"Donald Trump made his fortune building commercial real estate, but as a candidate he's selling a gated community. The Republican front-runner released his first ad Monday, and its message is that he will keep them out. By them, he means Mexicans and Muslims. The ad is not subtle. It includes images of ISIS fighters, the San Bernardino shooters, and dark figures crossing the border in hordes like an army storming the keep. (For those of you who thought the cinematic quality of the invading army seemed almost too menacing to be true, it turns out you were right. According to Politifact, it wasn't people crossing the Mexican border. The footage in the Trump ad is of people crossing the Moroccan border, who pose no immediate threat to the United States, an ocean away.) The ad is a distillation of the Trump pitch. It's a bouillon cube of Trump, the one message he wants voters to have in their minds when they go into the voting booth. Campaigns are about creating a need that only one candidate can fulfill. In this case Trump is the protector. Polls show that on the issue of terrorism, GOP voters trust Trump above all others. The ad is not about his ability to make great trade deals or increase wages. He's going to keep you safe. And if that wasn't already your concern--terrorism is the top worry for GOP voters--it might very well be after watching the ad. Trump is promising to keep America from being overrun. That also means, according to his first political spot, to ""cut the head off ISIS."" That promise is an evolution from Trump's original passive rumination that it might be OK if the Russians took care of the terrorist group in Syria. Rick Santorum also put out a new ad on Monday. ""We are at war and it is too risky to elect another senator with just a couple years experience while the world is burning,"" says the ad in an obvious dig at Sens. Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Rand Paul. It then goes on to tout the former Pennsylvania senator's experience in the Senate handling national security issues. Santorum's ad seems almost quaint by comparison in its adherence to pre-Trump rules of politics. So far, GOP voters who have responded in polls haven't prized experience. Instead they have rewarded perceived strength and bluntness--campaign rhetoric and behavior that they believe will translate into strength in the Oval Office. Trump has none of the experience that Santorum is talking about. He doesn't even have the experience that any of the senators running have, but so far that has only helped Trump's candidacy. He's running on his success in the private sector, which he argues can be easily transferred to government. It's not just the Trump ad that seeks to create an appetite in the electorate for strength. When it comes to policy debates, the front-runner keeps defining the contest in terms of weakness and strength. On Face the Nation he offered a perfect example of how he frames these issues for Republican primary voters on the issue of immigration:"	Trump's First Political Ad Is Pure Trump	['Paul', 'Trump']	[]
