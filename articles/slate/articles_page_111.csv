The latest incarnation: a bill approved 31-22 by the Arizona House of Representatives on Monday that would require 2012 presidential candidates to offer proof of citizenship in order to qualify for the ballot. The proposal has little chance of becoming law. For that to happen, the state Senate would have to pass it and the governor would have to sign it. But it's still the closest birtherism has come to being codified. Democrats have dutifully condemned the bill. One Phoenix legislator said it's turning Arizona into ""the laughing stock of the nation."" White House spokesman Bill Burton dismissed the measure and others like it on CNN as ""fringe right-wing radio conspiracy theories."" Steve Benen of the Washington Monthly wrote, ""The fact that fringe lunacy is being taken seriously at this level suggests a strain of contemporary Republican thought that's gone stark raving mad."" Even some Republicans are rushing to distance themselves from the bill, particularly senatorial candidate J. D. Hayworth, whom John McCain has tried to tie to the fringiest elements of the Tea Party movement. But shouldn't the real reaction be, This again? Why, more than a year into Obama's presidency, are we still talking about whether he is constitutionally allowed to serve? The birther movement lingers because it means different things to different people. For liberals, questioning Obama's citizenship is tantamount to racism. Anyone who does it hates black people and is simply trying to disguise his prejudice--conscious or not--by implying that Obama is a foreigner. For conservatives, though, demanding to see Obama's birth certificate has become less of a real-world concern--after all, Obama released his Hawaii birth certificate during the 2008 campaign--than a symbolic way for Republican politicians to show that they, too, are worried about America. They don't have to actually believe Obama was born in Kenya to associate with the birthers. The trick has been defining birtherism down. Look at how politicians on the right talk about it--or, more accurately, around it. It's rare that an elected official will call for Obama to produce his birth certificate, a la Orly Taitz. More often, he will simply raise questions--innocent questions!--about Obama's origins. ""What I don't know is why the president can't produce a birth certificate,"" said Rep. Roy Blunt of Missouri when ambushed by a video blogger last July. ""I don't know anybody else that can't produce one. And I think that's a legitimate question."" (When the interviewer pointed out that Obama had indeed produced a birth certificate, Blunt dismissed him.) Other times, they won't endorse the birther argument so much as decline to reject it. As Sarah Palin told a radio host in December: ""I think the public rightfully is still making it an issue. I don't have a problem with that. I don't know if I would have to bother to make it an issue, because I think that members of the electorate still want answers."" (Italics added.) It's not about Palin, see. It's about the people. They want answers. Even Republicans who want to require candidates to produce birth certificates don't sound especially up in arms about Obama. Tommy Stringer, a member of the South Carolina General Assembly who introduced a bill similar to the Arizona measure, told the Washington Independent that the birth certificate the Obama campaign provided ""satisfies"" him, barring evidence that Obama was born elsewhere. So why did he introduce the bill? It's about transparency, he said. It's this kind of do-si-do that allows politicians on the right to associate themselves with the birthers but not necessarily be of them. It's also good politics. A recent New York Times/CBS News poll found that only 58 percent of Americans believe Obama was born in the United States. Entertaining this notion without endorsing it thus works as a conservative dog whistle. It shows that politicians understand the concerns of the far right, even if they don't plan on joining it. The irony of all the birth-certificate proposals--similar bills have been introduced in six states--is that they contain the seeds of the birther movement's destruction. The moment Obama calls their bluff and hands his birth certificate to the Arizona secretary of state, it's over. In theory. That's the beauty of the birther myth, or any conspiracy theory: No amount of evidence can ever completely dispel the questions. When Obama produced his Hawaii birth certificate and the state of Hawaii verified it, it was a fake. When reporters uncovered announcements of Obama's birth in 1961 copies of the Honolulu Advertiser and the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, they had been planted. If the Arizona secretary of state verified Obama's birth certificate, that would be due to the government mind-control chip implanted in his molar. To put all this another way: Birtherism is here to stay. And not because more people are going crazy, but because crazy has been redefined. Birtherism isn't the only example. Consider how conservatives accuse Obama of peddling ""socialism."" Sure, some of them genuinely think that Obama is going to usher in a new Soviet state in which the government owns all means of production. But most right-wingers use it as shorthand for government overreach. So now that's what ""socialism"" means. There is a fairly major difference between birtherism and the socialism charge: Birtherism has been disproved by facts. But they're similar in the way they get tossed around without much connection to their original meaning. Republican politicians like to carry copies of the Constitution in their breast pockets. In 2012, maybe they'll tote around their birth certificates, too. Like  Slate on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	"Why the ""birther"" myth refuses to die."

On Saturday, though, the president said something that may have caused people to wake up and take notice. Obama called the Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell ""cynical and deceptive"" for asserting that financial regulatory reform legislation now under consideration in Congress would lead to future bailouts. President Obama usually keeps it vague. His disagreements are with ""some people"" or those who want to ""defend the status quo."" It's usually clear whom he's talking about, but Obama, like all presidents, generally adds a little soft padding to stay presidential and above it all. That aloofness irritated some of his Democratic allies during the health care fight. They were glad he finally took the fight to Republicans in the end and appeared ready to keep the pressure there. They like that he's doing it again now with McConnell. This is an election year, after all. ""If he'd done this a little earlier on health care, maybe it would have passed sooner,"" said one veteran Democrat involved in the fall campaigns. The president benefits from being specific in this case because he has a story to tell about McConnell. His charge is not merely that the GOP leader is mischaracterizing the financial reform legislation. The president is charging that McConnell is in the pocket of Wall Street bankers. ""It turns out Mitch McConnell thinks differently,"" Obama told Democratic donors after explaining why he supports the legislation. ""I don't know exactly what happened, but he and the chairman of the Senate [electoral] committee went up to Wall Street, had a pow-wow with them, and came away--the next thing we knew they were all opposed to financial-regulatory reform. I don't know the nature of the conversation but I'm hoping that they will do the right thing."" Why respond so directly? No one else could do the job. If this were the debate over health care legislation, the president might be letting Democratic leaders fight it out. But in this case the White House does not want to risk losing the fight to define the legislation. The ""Wall Street bailout"" charge is perhaps the most toxic one in American politics right now. It inspires conservatives, irritates independents, and depresses liberals. In a political campaign where Democrats seek to position themselves as defenders of the common people against insurance companies and Wall Street banks, the characterization could not risk getting muddied. On a policy level, the White House argues that the president used such strong language because McConnell was suggesting taxpayers would foot the bill for future bailouts when the legislation is designed to do the opposite--it would require banks to pay to liquidate failing institutions. Their case was rather thoroughly supported by Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee. ""This fund that's been set up is anything but a bailout,"" he said. ""It's been set up to provide upfront funding by the industry so that when these companies are seized, there's money available to make payroll and to wind it down while the pieces are being sold off."" The pressure seemed to be working. Sen. McConnell on Tuesday seemed to pull back from his previous opposition to the legislation, acknowledging that ""both parties agree on this point: no bailouts."" Senior Republican leadership aides said that McConnell spoke out against reform so strongly because he felt Democrats were not negotiating in good faith. Now that negotiations have restarted, they say, his goal has been achieved.  Democrats characterize this position as a climb-down and recognition that the politics were against him. Obama will add more fodder to this debate Thursday in a speech on Wall Street reform at Cooper Union. Will he be as tough on Wall Street as he has been on McConnell, whom he says is doing its bidding? White House aides say the speech will be to the American people, setting the stakes for the legislation they see with a clarity reminiscent of George W. Bush's position on Iraq. You're either with American families or with Wall Street. If he plays true to type, Obama will take the balanced tone he has tried to apply throughout--decrying the excessive bonuses and risk-taking by banks while championing the need for vibrant financial markets. This has the added advantage of not overly offending the bankers who gave so generously to his campaign and the Democratic Party. But some of his allies say the moment calls for the same sharpness against Wall Street that he used with McConnell. That would help push the legislation and make a statement about what Democrats stand for. As the White House knows, polls show that talking about restraining Wall Street only makes this legislation more popular. If he needs a model, Obama might refer to Woodrow Wilson, another president known for his cerebral approach. In 1910, just before running for governor of New Jersey, Wilson gave a lecture about self-sacrifice which Obama could actually lift word-for-word today:"	How a calm, reasonable president gets exercised about ... financial regulation.

Romney is a politician, and even politicians with more spine than Romney (i.e., nearly all of them) are sometimes forced into awkward postures by the shifting dynamics of electoral politics. But naif that I am, I figured the conservative think tanks that developed these same policies would, if they couldn't bring themselves to claim authorship, at least maintain a discreet silence. I was wrong. ""Obama's Health Reform Isn't Modeled After Heritage Foundation Ideas"" reads the headline of an April 19 op-ed in the Washington Post. The author, Robert Moffit, is director of Heritage's Center for Health Policy Studies. Moffit's piece is a response to President Obama's comment, in a March 30 an interview with Matt Lauer on NBC's Today, that the idea for health-insurance exchanges ""originated from the Heritage Foundation."" Actually, Heritage didn't invent the exchanges idea, but it certainly helped develop it. In his new book  No Apology, Romney writes:"	The conservative Heritage Foundation indignantly denies influencing Obamacare.
3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/04/dying_breed.html	"Do you remember the Responsible Republicans? In the 1980s, small herds of them still roamed freely around Washington. In 1982, they voted for the largest tax increase in history to mitigate the fiscal harm of Ronald Reagan's 1981 tax cut. * In 1983, they converged on Capitol Hill to pass a package of tax increases and benefit cuts recommended by the Greenspan Commission to keep Social Security solvent. In 1986, they followed Wyoming Sen. Alan Simpson to pass bipartisan immigration reform legislation by a large majority. In 1990, several were spotted with President George H.W. Bush (the Responsible one) at Andrews Air Force Base, conspiring to reduce the deficit. After the Andrews summit, however, glimpses of them outside captivity became increasingly rare. With their habitats in the Northeast, Midwest, and Pacific Northwest under threat and their natural predators on the rise, the status of the species moved from ""threatened"" to ""endangered."" Though occasionally spotted on the rocky shoals of Maine's Penobscot Bay and in beach houses up and down the California coast, they now rarely emerge from the wilderness. During the  health care battle, President Obama was unable to find a single Responsible Republican to serve as a mascot. There continue to be rumors of the Double R's return around issues such as immigration, financial reform, and climate change. Yet we have now gone several years without a confirmed sighting. If Responsible Republicans are in fact nearing extinction, I think we can identify the crucial event that signaled their demise. It was a December 1993 memo by conservative strategist and commentator William Kristol. Kristol's advice about how Republicans should respond to Bill Clinton's 1993 health care effort--and a series of follow-up memos he wrote in 1994--pushed the GOP away from cooperation with Democrats on any social and economic legislation. His message marks the pivotal moment when Republicans shifted from fundamentally responsible partners in governing the country to uncompromising, hyperpartisan antagonists on all issues. In his five-page memo, Kristol took aim at Bob Dole and other congressional Republicans who were then working with Democrats to find a compromise around shared goals of universal coverage and cost containment. Kristol called for the GOP to ""adopt an aggressive and uncompromising counterstrategy designed to delegitimize the proposal,"" arguing that a bipartisan deal on health care would be a political victory for Democrats and a defeat for the GOP. ""Unqualified political defeat of the Clinton health care proposal,"" Kristol wrote, ""... would be a monumental setback for the president, and an incontestable piece of evidence that Democratic welfare-state liberalism remains firmly in retreat."" Slowly at first, then all at once, Republicans adopted this zero-sum view of politics. Newt Gingrich, the truculent House minority leader, had risen to power attacking the 1990 budget summit and the more conciliatory Republican leadership that preceded him. Dole soon adopted the rejectionist approach as well, responding to Clinton's 1994 State of the Union address by echoing Kristol's line that there was ""no health care crisis."" Remaining Double Rs such as Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island were left out in the cold by their party, and hopes for a deal died. Kristol's Carthaginian strategy worked politically, or seemed to. Newt Gingrich and Contract With America Republicans swept into power in the 1994 midterm election on the basis of monolithic opposition to Clinton's economic plan and social agenda. But the Gingrich ""revolution"" soon failed. Its ideas were not enacted, Bill Clinton won re-election in 1996, and its leaders fell to a variety of scandals. Congressional Republicans kept their opposition to government at the level of rhetoric only, becoming bigger spenders than ever. But this outcome did not dim the GOP's essential faith in the Kristol approach. Under Obama, the Republican Party has simply tried to replay its script from the Clinton years, opposing everything the president proposes, looking for heretics to burn, and calling the other side extreme--though this time without blocking the president's major initiative. They've been at it again this week, claiming, absurdly, that financial regulations supported by Democrats would amount to a perpetual bank bailout. The politics of Republican implacability are based on what might seem an obvious insight that competition is a zero-sum game. If Democrats pass their plans, they succeed politically and Republicans lose. But while elections are zero-sum, politics as a whole is not. Without some level of bipartisan cooperation, voters become increasingly cynical, the system becomes too paralyzed to address the major issues, and the whole country suffers in consequence. Longer term, it is hard to see the politics of ""no"" as a winning Republican strategy. The rise of hyperpartisanship is not one of those problems for which the left and right are equally to blame. Democrats, who like legislating better than Republican do, and who have seldom had the GOP's ability to march in lockstep, still instinctively prefer to work on a bipartisan basis. They continue to hope, against the odds, that Double Rs will escape extinction and one day provide partners for them again. Perhaps Ted Turner will find a way to breed them on his ranch.

4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/04/year_two.html	"Crying and flapping of hands is to be expected from a 1-year-old. It's only in a child's second year that anyone expects them to start walking and talking. So it is with the Tea Parties. On Thursday morning--the one-year anniversary of the first Tax Day Tea Party in 2009--protesters gathered at a ""Liberty Summit"" held by the group FreedomWorks. Part pep rally, part victory lap, the real purpose, it seemed, was to learn how to do more than just complain. ""You have the power,"" State Delegate Bob Marshall, R-Va., told a packed auditorium at the Ronald Reagan Building, a federal office building in Washington. ""You just have to get organized. ... If you don't organize, you've got enthusiasm, but the congressmen are just gonna roll over you."" The event was basically Activism 101. The panels were organized by theme--""Dismantling ObamaCare,"" ""Economy in the Balance,"" and so on--but the overall goal was to turn words into action, angry hordes into activists. Tea Partiers have proven that they can make noise, get media coverage, and drive liberals bonkers. What they haven't shown is that they can win elections (unless you count this guy). Some Tea Party leaders have taken credit for the recent Republican victories in Virginia, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. But their influence is hard to measure. How many Tea Partiers are there? Do they have a core set of beliefs? What makes someone a Tea Partier vs. a regular old conservative? Does the label even matter? We may not know until we see the exit polls in November. In the meantime, Tea Partiers have a lot to learn about ground-level political organizing. First up: lobbying. Every attendee got a tip sheet on how to lobby a member of Congress. On the sheet: Show up five minutes early. Prepare questions ahead of time. Always be polite. Dick Armey, former Republican majority leader and chairman of FreedomWorks, reiterated this last point in his remarks. ""We are going to be assertive, we are going to be well-mannered, we are going to be good-humored,"" he said. ""But we're going to be insistent, because our cause is too compelling and too just."" After the event, protesters fanned across the Hill to practice. Then there were the nuts and bolts of political organizing. For inspiration, Tea Partiers turned to the 18th century. ""Sam Adams was one of the first practitioners in America of what we call political technology,"" said former Bush-Cheney field operator Chris Stio. He defined the term as ""the ability to organize people who share your beliefs"" and to ""communicate your ideas to the public at large."" In the years before the revolution, Stio said, Adams created ""committees of correspondence"" in Massachusetts to spread his message to other parts of the country. Today's equivalent: social networks. In that realm, though, Tea Partiers have a lot of catching up to do. ""Obama's people, they all open their eyes in the morning after they check their Twitter,"" said Richard Delgaudio, a longtime activist from York, Pa. After a speaker politely called the audience ""seasoned,"" someone yelled out: ""We're old!"" It's now gospel that conservatives have coopted the tactics of the radical left, particularly the writings of community organizer Saul Alinsky. But Tea Party leaders saw it as just the opposite. In the 1990s, said FreedomWorks president Matt Kibbe, ""we were studying the tactics of the left--how they got people to show up on the streets, how they used grassroots pressure to intimidate Congress to do their will."" As it turns out, he said, they used the Boston Tea Party as their model. ""When did we give away our tradition?"" Kibbe asked the crowd. ""Don't you think we should take it back from them?"" Likewise, Daryn Iwicki of the Leadership Institute argued that the Obama campaign modeled its youth outreach on Ronald Reagan's. Speakers also emphasized that Tea Parties have to be about more than saying ""no."" ""I hear the word 'stop' a lot,"" said one man during a Q and A. ""Fundamentally, what--and I'd like for us to put our thinking caps on--what do we propose as a positive thing? We're so busy playing defense. ... I want to see us developing a positive agenda to go after those other people."" Kibbe had a phrase at the ready: ""legislative entrepreneurs."" That is, ""guys that are not only gonna stand on principle, but know what to do with that, know how to drive a positive vision."" Among those he cited: House candidate Allen West and senatorial candidate Marco Rubio, both Florida Republicans. Ultimately, though, Tea Party influence will come down to good-old-fashioned get-out-the-vote efforts. As Stio put it: ""You're the person who calls people during dinner."" You're the one who knocks on doors. You're the one who follows up with a letter, making sure to mention the person's dog in your note."" Whether Tea Partiers will do that--and in enough numbers to make a difference--is anyone's guess. ""The big question is, are they going to ring the doorbells and fill out the voter sheets and write out the donation checks? Or are they going to complain?"" said Delgaudio. ""I admit I don't know.""

5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/04/sarah_palin_is_the_new_al_gore.html	"A portion of Sarah Palin's speaking contract has been discovered. In it she requests that at the podium she get bendable straws for her two water bottles. When she flies, it must be first class (or on a midsize private jet); her cars must be SUVs or ""black town cars,"" and she must be put up in a suite at the kinds of hotels where the packages of nuts in the mini-bar cost more than the average hourly wage. Your reaction to this probably depends on your position on the political spectrum. If you are a liberal, you see it as proof that Palin is no ""hockey mom"" and that her humble persona was a fraud. If you are a conservative, you see it as proof that the free market has decreed that the Palin brand is more valuable than ever. (If you are fond of maxims, you are simply puzzled. Quitters never prosper, we're told, and yet Palin, who left her job with 17 months to go in her first term, has made $12 million since doing so, according to ABC News.) But if you step back and judge Palin by the standards of other celebrities and reality-show hosts, the contract seems pretty benign. She didn't demand white roses  or call for a police escort. * She doesn't ask that all televisions be tuned to Fox, like the man she wanted to succeed as vice president. She does ask that questions at her events be screened--which, given how thoroughly packaged presidential ""town hall"" performances are, should be considered a standard political request. Still, it is by the celebrity, not the political standard, that Palin should be judged. She is a personality--influential, polarizing, and not likely to be president--who talks about political affairs. In other words, she's a lot like Al Gore. To require her to follow the rules that politicians have to follow--to pretend to like pork rinds to show the common touch--seems unfair. This is true even though part of her performance is to pretend she's the person she once was. And it is no more a denial of her past than Gore's present wealth obscures his experiences as a young man on the family farm. There are obvious ways in which the Gore analogy breaks down. But they only add more to the case that Palin is influential but not presidential. Gore has more political and governmental experience and has spent much of his adult life promoting a set of ideas through writing, lecturing, and PowerPoint presentations. In the most recent poll of his popularity (2008), 58 percent of those asked had a favorable view of him. Palin is not popular. She has only a 24 percent favorability rating in the latest CBS poll. Nor has she chosen to promote a set of original ideas: She more refracts and channels them. Palin's unpopularity has been resilient. Her favorability and unfavorability ratings--the latter is 38 percent, about the same as Gore's--have not moved since she left the Alaska governor's office last July. In a Washington Post poll in February, 71 percent of respondents said she was not qualified to be president. In the recent CBS poll of Tea Party supporters, a plurality did not think she was qualified to be president. Finally, if independent voters, who are likely to determine the next election, come to the conclusion that they do not like President Obama, some large portion may do so because they have decided that it's a bad idea to elect people with little governing experience who can excite crowds. Sarah Palin is not going to be their candidate. As a political matter, if Palin is able to overcome these political challenges while speaking her mind as clearly as she does now, people should start lining up the sick and the lame for healings. Defining Palin as a political celebrity is not to say that she lacks connection or influence with the people she speaks for. But drinks before takeoff and high-thread-count sheets do not necessarily affect her relationship with her audience. Oprah Winfrey is very exacting and very wealthy and yet still has a vast following of regular people. She used her popularity to help Barack Obama. No one would think her request for bendable straws out of line. It might be galling to some that Palin makes so much money by talking so much about regular folk. But is she really any different from a musician who makes millions by singing about the working class? If you want to think about how Republicans will govern in the real world or look at the GOP philosophy in practice, there are vibrant examples to examine in New Jersey, Mississippi, California, and Virginia. In these places, conservatives are struggling to put ideas into practice that require real trade-offs and bring real consequences. These places are a better starting point for a legitimate debate about conservative politics and policy. Sarah Palin may be living the American dream, but she is a different person than she once was, and becomes more so with every plush engagement. We'll know she's truly crossed over when those who go through the trash looking for Palin relics don't give them to the news media but try to sell them on eBay.

(Comments may be quoted by name unless you specify otherwise.) Click here to read Slate's writeups on the candidates.  Jennifer  Granholm, 51, the current governor of Michigan, has no experience on the bench--which, as the Detroit News noted, would make her the first nonjudge to reach the court since William Rehnquist and Lewis Powell in 1972. Since she was born in Vancouver, she would also be the first foreign-born justice since Felix Frankfurter, who joined the court in 1939. Granholm does not have an extensive record from which to draw conclusions about her judicial philosophy. After graduating from Harvard Law in 1987, Granholm clerked for 6th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Damon Keith, who is credited with desegregating Pontiac and pushing back against the Nixon administration on wiretapping. (Granholm still considers Keith a mentor.) Granholm served as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Michigan for four years before being elected governor. She was re-elected governor in 2006 but is limited to two terms in office. Notable cases: As a prosecutor, Granholm's most newsworthy case involved the theft of nearly 49,000 copies of the movie  Fantasia. As attorney general, much of her focus was on consumer protection and high-tech crimes like identity theft. As governor, she has been preoccupied by budget fights with the state legislature because of Michigan's massive deficit. Elena  Kagan, 49, is also at the top of most shortlists, and we know she's confirmable because she has already been confirmed as the first female solicitor general of the United States, the only federal official required by statute to be ""learned in the law."" Kagan has a J.D. from Harvard Law School, where she was supervising editor of the law review. While Kagan had never argued a case before the court when chosen as solicitor general--her lack of Supreme Court experience led to a tense confirmation on a 61-31 vote--she did serve as clerk to Thurgood Marshall and as associate counsel to President Bill Clinton. Kagan would become the third Jewish justice on the current court, joining Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer. Her opponents on the right have criticized her for lacking judicial experience, though they might thank themselves for that, since Senate Republicans effectively blocked Kagan's nomination to a U.S. Court of Appeals seat in 1999. While Kagan has no judicial record to scour, she has done enough academic writing to create a significant paper trail. Her specialty is First Amendment and administrative law; she has also done a good deal of thinking about the proper role of the executive branch, most notably in a 2001 law review article that rather presciently addressed the theory of a ""unitary executive"" initiated in some sense by the Clinton Justice Department and especially beloved by Bush lawyers like David Addington. Kagan concluded that ""President Clinton's assertion of directive authority over administration, more than President Reagan's assertion of a general supervisory authority, raises serious constitutional questions."" Kagan is probably most famous for being a careful pragmatist who throws few ideological bombs. The New York Times has described her legal writings as ""dense, hedged and moderate."" She is also known as the woman who healed an ideological fracture that threatened to destroy Harvard Law School by recruiting prominent conservative faculty members and focusing attention on student needs. Conservative opponents have latched onto her opposition to on-campus military recruiting at Harvard because of the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" stance toward gay soldiers. Liberals, for their part, have been disappointed by Kagan's stance on hotly contested terrorism questions, including her support for indefinite detention of prisoners without a trial. Janet  Napolitano, 52, has an extensive background in public and private law, but like Jennifer Granholm and Elena Kagan, Napolitano has never served as a judge. After clerking for a judge on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals after law school, she joined a local Phoenix firm, where she specialized in commercial and appellate work. She quickly made partner, eventually joining Supreme Court scholar John P. Frank in defending Anita Hill at the Clarence Thomas hearings. President Clinton appointed her U.S. attorney for Arizona shortly after taking office, though her confirmation was held up for nearly a year over lingering resentment in the Senate. As the American Prospect notes, Napolitano was quick to build up ""law-and-order credibility"" as a federal prosecutor and later as the state's attorney general. (In 2002, she won the conviction of Salvatore ""Sammy the Bull"" Gravano, the former Gambino family associate who testified against John Gotti.) She is alsoconsidered moderate on immigration and strongly in favor of the death penalty. She was a popular two-term governor. Napolitano represented Anita Hill before the Senate judiciary committee during Thomas' confirmation hearing, an experience she says left her with a strong sense that ""women really didn't have an avenue to be heard at that time."" (Thomas, who would be one of Napolitano's colleagues if she became a justice, was narrowly confirmed.) As U.S. attorney, Napolitano supervised the investigation of Michael Fortier, an accomplice to the Oklahoma City bombers who later testified against them in court. In Ring v. Arizona, Napolitano unsuccessfully defended a state law before the Supreme Court that allowed a judge to determine whether aggravating factors in a case are sufficient to administer the death penalty. (The court ruled 7-2 against Arizona, finding that only a jury could make that decision.) Diane  Wood,59, has been on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit since Bill Clinton tapped her in 1995. She went to the University of Texas for college and law school and clerked on the Supreme Court for Justice Harry Blackmun. After she joined the faculty of the University of Chicago Law School, she became the first woman there to receive a named chair. She is one of the most respected voices on the 7th Circuit--a lawyer's court known for its high standards at oral argument. Judges Frank Easterbrook and Richard Posner, two conservative colleagues with giant intellects, send Wood their draft opinions for review. Notable cases: Last time a vacancy on the Supreme Court came up, the right quickly targeted Wood for her 2001 ruling in NOW v. Scheidler, which allowed a lower-court judge to prevent anti-abortion protesters, nationwide, from blockading clinics. Wood's ruling approved a novel use of RICO, the federal anti-racketeering law. The Supreme Court overturned her in 2003; Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg concurred out of concern about extending the reach of RICO to political protests. In 2002, Wood dissented from a ruling by Easterbrook upholding an Indiana law that raised the cost of an abortion by requiring that a woman make a separate trip to her clinic to give informed consent before the procedure. On First Amendment grounds, in 2004 Wood ruled against a city's ban of a convicted sex offender from its parks, after he admitted to cruising for children there but left without molesting them. And when a condo owner sued to put up a mezuzah on his doorpost, challenging his condo association's rule against placing ""objects of any sort"" in the hallways, Wood dissented from another Easterbrook opinion deeming the rule neutral with respect to religion. ""The condo association might as well hang a sign outside saying 'No Observant Jews Allowed,' "" she wrote. Cass  Sunstein, 55, is a close confidante of Obama's whose resume, up to a point, looks a lot like the president's: Harvard Law School and a professorship at the University of Chicago with a focus on constitutional law. Until recently, when he accepted a job as the head of the White House's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, he had spent most of his career in the academy after clerking for Thurgood Marshall and a short stint at the Office of Legal Counsel in the early '80s. Often described as a polymath, Sunstein is fluent in political science and churns out books. The latest is  Nudge, about the power of gently guiding people toward the choices you want them to make. Though he's willing to be called a liberal, Sunstein is not a stock liberal's dream candidate. He has a strong libertarian streak, though he promotes a theory of ""libertarian paternalism"" that finds some space for encouraging positive behavior. He also advocates judicial restraint, urging the court to limit the scope of its decisions--a ""one case at a time"" approach. He is cautious on domestic wiretapping, suggesting it may be legal under the president's various authorities, and mostly opposes the prosecution of Bush administration officials accused of illegal activity. Sunstein has characterized the current court as being composed of ""two different kinds of conservatives"" and has argued that the court has drifted to the right over the last three decades. He is generally disdainful of ideology-driven jurisprudence. He supported John Roberts' nomination but told Slate in 2007 that he was ""surprised that Roberts has shown no unpredictability at all"" in his unwavering conservatism. If he makes it onto the court, Sunstein is unlikely to be so reliable for the left. Leah  Ward Sears, 54, has a string of firsts to her name--she's the first African-American woman to be a superior court judge in Georgia, the first appointed to the state Supreme Court, and the first to become the chief of that court, after then-Gov. Zell Miller appointed her to fill a vacancy. In 2004, conservatives waged a major campaign to unseat Sears by throwing money at her opponent. She prevailed with 62 percent of the vote. She retired from the bench last year and joined the Atlanta-based firm Schiff Hardin LLP. Sears calls herself ""a moderate with a progressive streak."" She doesn't sound like a lefty when she campaigns for a pet cause: strengthening marriage. ""As a judge I am often frustrated that I must work within a system designed only to pick up the pieces after families have already fallen apart or failed to come together,"" she wrote in a 2006 Washington Post op-ed. Sears, who is divorced herself and has two children, is thoughtful rather than pat on the topic: While she worries about kids who grow up in single-parent families, she said in a 2007 speech that ""as a woman who came of age at the height of the feminist movement, I do not really hold naive notions about the so-called good old days, Ozzie and Harriet and that kind of thing."" Twin fun facts from this 2005 profile: Sears annoyed some of her civil rights allies by inviting her old friend Justice Clarence Thomas to her inauguration, and she named her daughter Brennan, after one of the Supreme Court's liberal lions, former Justice William Brennan. Notable cases: As a state court judge, Sears did not built a long record interpreting federal law. She wrote the 2007 ruling that released Genarlow Wilson from prison, based on the theory that his 10-year sentence, for having sex with a 15-year-old girl when he was 17, was ""grossly disproportionate to his crime."" In 2008, she dissented from a ruling of her court upholding the death sentence of a man who killed an off-duty cop. Seven of the nine witnesses against the defendant had recanted, some of them saying their trial testimony had been coerced. Sears said the court was skirting the ""fundamental question"": whether an innocent man was being put to death. She also opposed, in 2004, the Georgia Supreme Court's decision to allow on the ballot an amendment to the constitution that succeeded in banning same-sex marriage. Kim  McLane Wardlaw, 55, has 16 years of private practice (at the firm O'Melveny & Myers) to back up her 14 years on the bench. She had a business litigation practice with a specialty in intellectual property and media defense. Bill Clinton appointed Wardlaw to the federal district court in California after she volunteered for his presidential campaign in the 1992 election and served on the Clinton-Gore transition team at the Justice Department. In 1998, Clinton elevated her to the 9th Circuit. She sailed through both her confirmations with bipartisan support. (Sen. Dianne Feinstein is one of her backers.) Don't let the blond chignon fool you: Wardlaw is the first Latina to serve on a federal appeals court. She is truly of mixed heritage--in this 2009 interview, she writes, ""My mother was Mexican, Catholic, and Republican, while my father was a Scottish-Irish Presbyterian and a loyal Democrat."" She also says: ""Women can have it all, but not all at the same time. ... The real life consequences of my desire to make partner as a litigator in an international law firm were that I did not marry until I was 30; did not have my first child until I was 35; and found myself at age 41 with a six-month-old infant daughter starting a job as a U.S. District Court Judge."" Notable cases: Wardlaw wrote the 9th Circuit opinion, which the Supreme Court largely concurred with on appeal, which found a violation of the Fourth Amendment in an Arizona school's strip-search of a 13-year-old girl wrongly suspected of hiding prescription-strength ibuprofen in her underwear. Wardlaw wrote that ""a reasonable school official, seeking to protect the students in his charge, does not subject a 13-year-old girl to a traumatic search to 'protect' her from the danger of Advil."" In 2008, Wardlaw wrote the first appellate opinion giving Fourth Amendment protection to e-mail messages, in a case brought by government workers whose bosses wanted to search their e-mail accounts. The Electronic Frontier Foundation called the ruling ""a tremendous victory for your online privacy."" In another case on appeal to the Supreme Court this term, Wardlaw ruled that AT&T must give women who retired from the company credit, in calculating pension benefits, for work time lost decades ago for maternity leave. (The Supreme Court disagreed.) And in a 2004 ruling affirmed by the Supreme Court, Wardlaw strengthened the hand of the Environmental Protection Agency in enforcing the Clean Air Act, in a case about whether the EPA could stop a new pollution-spewing mine over the objections of the state of Alaska. Pam  Karlan, 50, teaches law at Stanford University. As founding director of the school's Supreme Court Litigation Clinic, she has helped represent dozens of defendants in criminal and civil rights matters, all free of charge. An expert on constitutional and election law, Karlan has served as assistant counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. Karlan has authored three leading casebooks on constitutional law (one of which Obama taught from) and is co-author of  Keeping Faith With the Constitution, which offers a progressive theory of jurisprudential interpretation. Karlan confirmed to Politico that she is ""counted among the LGBT crowd."" Karlan, whose legal writing is both trenchant and prolific, has become something of a rock star on the legal-conference circuit. Karlan has no judicial record to probe, but she has an immense collection of writings. She argued at the Supreme Court in defense of the Voting Rights Act and wrote an amicus brief on behalf of legal academics in the 2003 case Lawrence v. Texas, arguing that laws against consensual sodomy were unconstitutional. She has defended criminal defendants in police search cases at the high court and has been a strong advocate for gay marriage. (Disclosure: Karlan is an acquaintance of Dahlia Lithwick's.) Merrick  Garland, 57, has something in common with four of the current Supreme Court justices: Like Roberts, Thomas, Scalia, and Ginsburg, he comes from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which, as the National Law Journal notes, is considered the second-most important court and a breeding ground for Supreme Court justices. After he graduated from Harvard Law School, Garland clerked for Justice William Brennan Jr., worked for Jimmy Carter's Justice Department, spent time in private practice and as a federal prosecutor, and returned to the DoJ under Clinton, where he oversaw the investigation of the Oklahoma City bombings and prosecuted the Unabomber. For this Supreme Court nomination, he bears the obvious liability of being a white male at a time when Obama is facing pressure on many fronts to nominate someone who has at most one of those traits. Garland is usually described as a moderate liberal, engaging on the bench and getting along with conservative colleagues on the D.C. Circuit. He has a background in both antitrust and administrative law as well. Notable cases: In June 2008, Garland wrote the D.C. Circuit Court's decision that Guantanamo detainee Huzaifa Parhat was unfairly classified as an enemy combatant. When Roberts still sat on the D.C. Circuit, he and Garland concurred on an opinion that granted a former D.C. Metro employee the right to sue for disability discrimination. Unlike Roberts, he voted not to rehear a case against a California developer who was challenging the Endangered Species Act over a dispute with the Arroyo toad, and he has generally sided with environmentalists. Kathleen  Sullivan, 54, is the former dean of Stanford Law School, teaches constitutional law there, and has authored the nation's leading constitutional law casebook. She is chair of the National Appellate Practice at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, which recently added her name to its billing. A one-time Marshall scholar, Sullivan's constitutional knowledge is prodigious. Her former law professor Laurence Tribe once called Sullivan ""the most extraordinary student I had ever had."" The National Law Journal has twice named her one of the ""100 Most Influential Lawyers in America"" and has twice named her as one of the ""50 Most Influential Women Lawyers in America."" Last time around, Politico reported that she was a lesbian; she did not comment. Sullivan is a gifted oral advocate and has argued five cases at the Supreme Court, notably several important business cases in recent years, including an appeal representing wineries challenging bans on the direct shipment of wine to consumers living out of state. She was also a member of the legal team that challenged the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law. Sullivan has filed amicus briefs in two seminal gay rights cases at the Supreme Court, Lawrence v. Texas and Bowers v. Hardwick, and authored an amicus brief in a case involving the constitutionality of gay marriage in California. She is also well-known for her pro bono work in high-profile cases involving civil rights and civil liberties. In a brief she co-authored in a landmark case about warrantless NSA wiretapping, she wrote, ""Whatever inherent powers the President might have under Article II, they do not include the power to conduct a warrantless domestic surveillance campaign, of indefinite duration and unlimited scope, where a duly enacted statute expressly prohibits such conduct."" (Disclosure: Sullivan was a professor of Dahlia Lithwick's at law school.) Margaret  McKeown, 58, was the first woman partner at the Seattle law firm Perkins Coie, where her 23-year practice concentrated on antitrust and intellectual property law and her clients included Boeing and Citicorp. Bill Clinton nominated her to the 9th Circuit in 1996. After Republicans refused to bring the nomination to a vote, Clinton had to nominate her again in 1997. In the end, she was confirmed by a wide margin of 80-11. McKeown's nomination ran into trouble, initially, because of her pro-bono legal work for the Washington Association of Churches. In 1994, she helped the mainstream church group work with the ACLU in trying to declare unconstitutional two citizen initiatives, written to deny gay people protection from discrimination based on sexual orientation. McKeown also came under attack from conservatives for signing a resolution urging the American Bar Association to support Roe v. Wade. Notable cases: In 2007, McKeown wrote the 9th Circuit opinion that barred an Islamic charity from showing, with a confidential government document, that the National Security Agency had wiretapped its offices without a warrant. McKeown accepted ""the need to defer to the executive on matters of foreign and national security"" and wrote that judges ""surely cannot legitimately find ourselves second-guessing the executive in this arena."" She rejected, however, the Justice Department's argument that ""the very subject matter"" of the litigation was a state secret--a position the Obama administration has continued to take. In 2007, McKeown pushed the Bush EPA to update its water-pollution guidelines under the Clean Water Act, by recognizing the effect of new technology. The EPA position that it did not have to take new technology into account ""strains credulity to the breaking point,"" McKeown wrote. In the famed challenge to the Pledge of Allegiance that came before the 9th Circuit, McKeown voted for a rehearing of the three-judge panel ruling that under God in the pledge violated the Constitution's separation of church and state. McKeown did not say that she thought the panel had gotten the case wrong but that it presented ""a constitutional question of exceptional importance."" Hillary  Clinton, 62, was active in law for two decades between graduating from Yale Law School in 1973 and moving to Washington as first lady in 1993. After a brief stint working for the House judiciary committee on the impeachment of President Richard Nixon, she moved to Arkansas to reunite with law school flame Bill Clinton, where she taught at the University of Arkansas law school and joined the Rose Law Firm. She became the first female partner there in 1979 and continued to practice during Bill Clinton's tenure as governor. She has remained in Washington for the last 16 years, including eight as the junior senator from New York and now as Obama's secretary of state. Much of Clinton's early work was devoted to advocacy for children, including championing the Children's Defense Fund. She co-founded the Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families. Her first scholarly article, published in the Harvard Educational Review, was titled ""Children Under the Law"" and argued that children should not be categorically treated as incompetent to make legal decisions up until their 18th birthdays. (She elaborated on this topic in future articles, stating that courts should intervene in family cases only in extreme circumstances but that children in such cases should be treated as gradually more independent as they mature.) At the Rose Law Firm, Clinton focused on intellectual property and patent infringement cases. She also worked in business litigation, including work for Wal-Mart and TCBY. (It was also at Rose that she billed 60 hours of work to Madison Guaranty, which later became a subject of intense scrutiny during the Whitewater investigation.) The National Law Journal twice named her one of the 100 most influential American lawyers. If Clinton were to get the nod, her pro-choice record would be scrutinized--along with plenty of other positions she has taken on the campaign trail. Martha  Minow, 55, is a star legal academic at Harvard Law School and a leading expert on family law, a field she entered in 1980 despite being told it would stereotype her. ""She helped bring alive the field,"" former Stanford Law School Dean Kathleen Sullivan (a fellow short-lister) said in a 1997 profile in the Boston Globe. Minow's interest in making sure that kids grow up in stable families, she explained in a 2001 op-ed, led her to become a plaintiff in a suit that challenged the constitutionality of a voter initiative in Massachusetts that tried to ban same-sex marriage. ""Research makes it irrefutable that a definition of family founded solely on an official marriage of a man and a woman is out of touch with how people actually live,"" she wrote. Minow has also been active in human rights, serving on the Independent International Commission on Kosovo, which tried to understand whether the atrocities committed there in the 1990s could have been prevented, and helping to launch a program of the U.N. High Commission for Refugees called Imagine Coexistence, which assessed efforts to reintegrate refugees after violent ethnic conflict and produced a book. Her latest book,  Just Schools, is about how schools can pursue social equality and accommodate students from different racial, ethnic, and religious backgrounds. She talks about those themes here. As a teacher, she takes steps to make sure that all kinds of students speak up in class. ""I am quite conscious to count seconds, usually 25 to 30, between raising a question and finding a volunteer,"" she told the New York Times in 2004. ""Some people who take time to think might have better things to say. Women typically won't shoot up their hands first."" Minow is close to Obama, whom she mentored when he was a law student at Harvard. Her father, former FCC Commissioner Newton Minow, gave Obama his first legal job, hiring him as a Chicago law firm summer associate. She has been a strong backer of the president, but she also speaks with her own voice: In an op-ed in March, she warned the government to make sure it is strictly accountable for stimulus spending. She told Slate last year that she didn't think Obama would necessarily favor moderate judicial picks over strongly liberal ones. Her own motto, from Justice Thurgood Marshall, for whom she clerked, is ""remember they're human beings,"" referring to the people who come before courts. It's akin to Obama's declaration that he is looking for a justice who thinks about ""how our laws affect the daily realities of people's lives."" (Disclosure: Minow also clerked for the late Judge David Bazelon, who was Emily's grandfather.) Teresa Wynn  Roseborough, 51, is chief litigation counsel at MetLife Inc., leading a department of several dozen associates and supervising MetLife's litigation activities worldwide. Her specialties include constitutional law, class actions, telecommunications, and government regulation law, and she has argued before state and federal courts as well as at the Supreme Court. She graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill law school in 1986, where she edited the law review.In addition to her solid footing in the outside-the-beltway business community, Roseborough also has strong D.C. connections. She worked as one of the principal attorneys for the Gore campaign during the 2000 presidential election and has served on the board directors of the American Constitution Society with now-Attorney General Eric Holder. Roseborough served as deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel in the Justice Department from 1994-96 and as a law clerk for Justice John Paul Stevens in 1987. In 2003, she was named by American Lawyer magazine as one of the 45 highest-performing members of the private bar under the age of 45.If President Obama means what he says about wanting Supreme Court justices with dramatically different work experiences and backgrounds, Roseborough's non-Ivy, nonjudicial background might be very compelling. That she is whip-smart and an African-American woman are icing on the cake. David  Tatel, 68, sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, long considered a sort of feeder court for the Supreme Court. Before joining the federal bench, Tatel worked in civil rights, including a stint as director of the National Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. He spearheaded programs to advance the rights of minorities and the poor through housing, voting rights, education, and employment litigation. He also served as director of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare's Office for Civil Rights in the Carter administration. At 68, Tatel is widely believed to be too old to be elevated to the high court, and the fact that he is a white male will hardly be an asset this time around. If tapped for a SCOTUS seat, Tatel would become the first blind justice. Notable cases: Tatel has written several opinions that have gone on to become blockbusters at the Supreme Court, including the important test of the Voting Rights Act that went before the Court last year. Tatel wrote 161 pages for a unanimous panel, upholding Section 5 of the act from a constitutional challenge. (The Supreme Court left the law largely intact.) In 2005, he voted to uphold a lower court's contempt decision against New York Times reporter Judith Miller, finding the grand jury's need for Miller's testimony outweighed the burden of disclosure on newsgathering. He wrote, ""[J]ust as attorney-client communications 'made for the purpose of getting advice for the commission of a fraud or crime' serve no public interest and receive no privilege ... neither should courts protect sources whose leaks harm national security while providing minimal benefit to public debate."" In a landmark environmental case from 2005, Tatel's dissent was vindicated when the Supreme Court found that the EPA had failed to comply with the mandate of the Clean Air Act when it refused to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. In 2003, Tatel also dissented in an important war on terror case when he sided with those seeking, though a FOIA request, the names of post-9/11 detainees and their attorneys. Tatel, dissenting from the majority's opinion denying the request, wrote that the ""court's uncritical deference to the government's vague, poorly explained arguments for withholding [information] as well as its willingness to fill in the factual and logical gaps in the government's case, eviscerates both FOIA itself and the principles of openness in government that FOIA embodies."" (Disclosure: Tatel is an acquaintance of Dahlia Lithwick's.) Lisa  Madigan, 43, is a rising star in Illinois politics, a friend and former colleague of Barack Obama's from the Illinois state Senate, and the current attorney general of the state. The New York Times named her among a roster of down-the-road candidates for the first female president. Consider this for Madigan's column: She successfully argued a case before the Supreme Court, the first attorney general to personally do so in 25 years--while seven months pregnant. The case, Illinois v. Caballes, gave police the authority to use drug-sniffing dogs on the outside of a stopped vehicle without a warrant or reason to suspect possession. As Law.com notes, Madigan has other serious law-and-order bona fides, such as advocating for stricter supervision and registration of sex offenders, stronger methamphetamine laws, and scrutiny of the state's gaming industry. Prior to joining the state senate, Madigan specialized in employment law at a Chicago firm and as attorney general filed an amicus brief in support of the University of Michigan's affirmative action policy in Grutter v. Bollinger. She also challenged former Illinois Gov. George Ryan's commutation of 32 death row inmates on legal grounds--and lost--and came under fire for not aggressively investigating 25 cases relating to a Chicago police commander accused of torture. Like Obama, Madigan has a background in community organizing. She also taught young women in South Africa during apartheid. Harold  Koh, 55, was the dean of Yale Law School until last year, when he stepped down after being tapped to serve as Hillary Clinton's chief legal adviser at the State Department. He is a star human rights litigator who forced the federal courts to grant rights to Haitian refugees held at Guantanamo Bay in the mid-1990s, though the Supreme Court eventually backed the government's policy of returning the refugees to Haiti without asylum hearings. From 1998 to 2001, Koh served as President Bill Clinton's assistant secretary of state for human rights. Before joining the faculty at Yale, in the 1980s Koh practiced law at Covington & Burling and worked in the Reagan Justice Department, in the Office of Legal Counsel. He clerked on the Supreme Court for Justice Harry Blackmun. His family came to the United States in the 1950s, when Koh's father was South Korea's minister to the United States, and chose to stay here after South Korea's 1961 coup. As a pre-eminent scholar of international law, Koh is a leading proponent of the notion that the United States can learn from the laws and judicial precedents of other countries. He has written and spoken about the role of ""transnational jurisprudence""--a body of law that spans different countries and international courts--and has shown that since the founding, the decisions of foreign courts have influenced the development of American law. The far right attacked Koh's views on international law after Obama tapped him for the State Department legal post, even though they largely match the positions taken by a majority of the Supreme Court in cases like Roper v. Simmons, which abolished the death penalty for defendants who commit crimes as juveniles. In a friend-of-the-court brief filed in that case, Koh attached the juvenile death penalty for clashing with American interests. We've weighed in about the Koh bashing on Slate here and here. If appointed, Koh would become the first Asian-American to sit on the Supreme Court. (Disclosure: Emily Bazelon is a fellow at Yale Law School.) Leigh Ingalls  Saufley, 55,is the chief justice of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court and the first woman and youngest member of the court ever to be appointed chief justice. A graduate of the University of Maine-Orono and the University of Maine School of Law, Saufley logged 10 years of service in the state's Attorney General Office. As chief justice, Saufley has spearheaded efforts to bring mental health courts to Maine, giving offenders the option of accepting mental health treatment in lieu of going to jail. She also supported a Maine law that would restrict how much information the public receives about a jury, if a judge deems the information should be kept secret. Notable cases: In 2007, she voted to approve a state statute requiring drivers involved in fatal car crashes to submit to blood tests for alcohol and other drugs, finding the privacy interests of drivers did not outweigh the state's need to determine whether they were using alcohol or other drugs prior to fatal crashes. In 1999, she voted with a unanimous court to dismiss a sexual abuse suit against the Jehovah's Witnesses, because to hold the church responsible would require delving into matters of redemption and forgiveness, ''an inquiry that would require secular investigation of matters that are almost entirely ecclesiastical in nature.'' In 1999, she also authored an opinion finding voucher funding of religious schools unconstitutional. If the president really wants a Supreme Court justice who is female, as an outsider with a dollop of David Souter's New England pragmatism, Saufley is an interesting choice. Myron  Thompson, 63, is a district judge in Alabama. President Carter chose him in 1980 at the age of 33 in an effort to put a black judge on Alabama's federal trial court. Thompson's opinions on voting rights and on who has standing to bring lawsuits are regularly invoked by other courts. He's also the judge who was undaunted by Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore when Moore insisted on displaying a massive granite Ten Commandments monument in the courthouse. Thompson ruled that effort a violation of the constitutionally required separation between church and state. The religious right called for Thompson's impeachment, but the 11th Circuit repeatedly upheld his rulings. Like the stone monument, Moore was finally removed from Alabama's court. Elizabeth  Warren, 60, has spent most of her career in academia but has a flair for public service. Though she's a tenured professor at Harvard, where she specializes in bankruptcy law, she's best known as the chairwoman of the Congressional Oversight Panel. At the COP, she polices the Troubled Assets Relief Program's $700 billion bank bailout with a populist zeal. Time  named Warren one of the 100 most influential people of 2009. Free-market advocates chastise Warren for her ardently pro-consumer politics. (Obama's proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency, Warren's brainchild, particularly rankles the financial-services industry.) Though she has no experience on the bench, Warren's expertise in business law exceeds that of any justice on today's court. ""I'm convinced that no one grasps the true nature of our hard times better than Elizabeth Warren,"" Maxed Out director James Scurlock argued in The Big Money last year. Warren was raised in Oklahoma, the daughter of a janitor and a Sears employee. Unlike the vast majority of Supreme Court justices and potential nominees, she went to college and law school at non-Ivy League universities--the University of Houston and Rutgers Law. After co-authoring  The Two Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke with her daughter in 2003, Warren has appeared several times on Dr. Phil and other national programs. Her experience on Dr. Phil, she has said, nudged her focus from ivory-tower scholarship to more direct forms of public service. An appointment to the high court would jibe with this trajectory. Carter G.  Phillips, 57, keeps a low public profile, but he's among the most accomplished Supreme Court lawyers under consideration. In March, the National Law Journal named Phillips one of the decade's 40 most influential lawyers. Phillips has argued more than 60 cases before the high court. Like Justice Stevens, Phillips earned his law degree from Northwestern University. Early in his career, Phillips clerked for Seventh Circuit appellate judge Robert Sprecher and Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren E. Burger. During his three years as assistant to the solicitor general, Phillips argued nine Supreme Court cases on behalf of the federal government. Today, he's a corporate lawyer and the managing partner at D.C. firm Sidley Austin LLP.Notable Cases: In the Supreme Court case FCC vs. Fox Television Stations, et al., Phillips defended broadcasters' right to air the ""F- and S-words"" during live telecasts. Phillips argued that Americans have become more tolerant the F-word, especially when used fleetingly, and don't exclusively associate it with sexual obscenity. The high court decided 5-4 against the broadcasters last April. Phillips also wrote a widely cited friend-of-the-court brief in favor of affirmative action, siding with the University of Michigan law school in the 2003 Supreme Court case Grutter v. Bollinger. The university won that case 5-4. Sidney  Thomas, 56, is a relatively unknown federal judge out of Montana whose name has surfaced as a possible long-shot Obama nominee. He earned his bachelors from Montana State University and his law degree from the University of Montana before going into private practice at a firm in Billings, which could satisfy critics who want to see a more geographically and educationally diverse court. He taught law at Rocky Mountain College for over a decade until he was nominated by Bill Clinton to his current seat on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in 1995. He was confirmed without controversy in 1996 and has served there ever since. The 9th Circuit is typically considered liberal, but Thomas' peers say Thomas doesn't fit the stereotype. His former law partner Bernard ""Bud"" Longo, a conservative Republican, said that he ""wouldn't class Sid Thomas with the Ninth Circuit,"" adding that he doesn't think Thomas is ""as rabid as that bunch."" There's not much in his record that stands out, with the exception of the 2006 civil rights case Nadarajah v. Gonzales. Ahi Nadarajah was part of an ethnic minority in Sri Lanka and repeatedly tortured before seeking asylum in the U.S. Upon arrival, he was imprisoned and detained for four years. Thomas ruled that government cannot authorize indefinite detention and that Nadarajah's imprisonment was illegal. Become a fan of  Slate on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/04/bobs_big_oy.html	"Politicians get into trouble when they try to play historian. Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia learned this lesson anew since declaring April to be Confederate History Month. A day after declaring that slavery wasn't significant to Virginia's Civil War history, he sounded the retreat. When he first defended his position, he said that slavery was not worth including because there were other causes for the war that were the ""most significant"" for the history of Virginia. A day later, when he reversed his position, he released a statement longer than the original proclamation testifying to the central role slavery played in the conflict. This might be seen by some as a climb-down in the face of political correctness. But it was simply common sense. McDonnell's original declaration failed by the very standards of history it cited. It argued for the observation of Confederate History Month because historical context demanded it but elided the historical context of that rather enormous thing called slavery. As a member of the party with an elephant as its mascot, the governor was not able to get a pass for ignoring the one in the room. McDonnell compounded his problem by explaining the declaration's lack of a slavery reference on the grounds that ""there were any number of aspects to that conflict between the states,"" he said. ""Obviously, it involved slavery. It involved other issues. But I focused on the ones I thought were most significant for Virginia."" This was historically nuts, politically curious, and logically inconsistent with McDonnell's own standards for other such proclamations. Look, for example, at the governor's proclamation celebrating Black History Month. It celebrates lots of people who had nothing to do with Virginia, such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Jackie Robinson. It also suggests an attitude toward historical complexity that is absent from the Confederate proclamation. ""It is important to learn from the many lessons of history's failures, successes, disappointments and triumphs as we continue to pursue our Founding Fathers' visions of liberty, justice and equality for all."" But it was McDonnell's previous view of history that was so hard to defend. The governor said slavery wasn't ""significant for Virginia."" There were 500,000 slaves in Virginia at the time of the Civil War. The Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, quoted in McDonnell's proclamation, seemed to have thought slavery was a pretty important part of the war. Richmond was the capital of the Confederacy and houses the largest museum devoted to celebrating the Confederacy. This year, to celebrate the sesquicentennial of the American Civil War, the Museum of the Confederacy will host a special lecture series devoted to the topic of slavery. This is why in 1998, former Gov. Jim Gilmore--like McDonnell and former Gov. George Allen, a Republican--amended the proclamation that Allen had first issued the year before. Gilmore added that slavery was ""a practice that deprived African-Americans of their God-given inalienable rights, which degraded the human spirit,"" and ""is abhorred and condemned by Virginians."" Finally, McDonnell built his proclamation on the idea that ""history should not be forgotten."" What he meant, he went on to say, was that the Confederacy should be assessed in its entirety--""in the context of the time in which it took place but also in the context of the time in which we live."" Good point. History is messy. But that's just exactly why you have to include history. The Confederacy was led by thoroughgoing racists who wanted to keep blacks subjugated for all time because of the color of their skin. Yet its greatest general was Robert E. Lee, who argued slavery was evil. (He just thought it was an evil that Providence should lessen over time, not one that should be abruptly swept away by abolitionists--whom he also labeled ""evil."") Also, if you're going to glorify context, don't you also have to then observe the larger war and include the Union Army of Virginia or the hundreds of thousands of Union casualties in Virginia? These differences among Confederates are worth studying, if for no other reason than to explore whether they are really differences. Such study may even tell us something about our current leaders: What is the difference, one might ask, between those who launch a war out of ideological zealotry and those who support that same war not for ideological reasons but because they genuinely believe it will protect their country? Speaking of ideology: By reversing his position McDonnell brings himself back into line with conservatives who are the ones usually arguing for universal truths. That's why George W. Bush, in his speech on slavery at Goree Island in Senegal in 2002, pointed out that placing slavery in historical context does not change the fact that slavery is a sin. ""We can fairly judge the past by the standards of President John Adams, who called slavery 'an evil of colossal magnitude,' "" Bush said. ""We can discern eternal standards in the deeds of William Wilberforce and John Quincy Adams, and Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Abraham Lincoln. These men and women, black and white, burned with a zeal for freedom, and they left behind a different and better nation."" As a political move, it was hard to fathom the initial overreach. This issue has become a switch that governors throw when they come into office. Democrats turn it off--McDonnell's two Democratic predecessors did not issue a proclamation honoring Confederate History Month--and Republicans turn it on. But the real puzzler was why McDonnell went the extra step to take out a previous Republican governor's nod to slavery. One easy answer was that McDonnell was trying to please conservatives, such as the Sons of Confederate Veterans, who requested the proclamation. But he wasn't weak with his conservative base. Conservatives already like him pretty well, given that he removed from workplace-discrimination law any claim based on sexual orientation and he promises to fight federal health care legislation. What he endangered was his image as a post-ideological ""future face of the Republican Party."" McDonnell is the one conservatives point to as an example of someone who can govern without becoming polarizing. He flirted with becoming the opposite case: the latest proof of a party trying too hard to appease its base. During last year's campaign, McDonnell's opponents tried to paint him has a closet troglodyte who would turn back the clock once he got into office. Exhibit A was his graduate thesis, in which he said working women and feminists were ""detrimental"" to the family. He weathered that storm by arguing that he wrote it 21 years ago and offering no hint of those unreconstructed views. After having a brief civil war with himself over the last day, he has once again come to reconstruction. Become a fan of  Slate on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	Virginia Gov.

A line to pass through the metal detector. A line to enter the South Lawn. A line for the bathroom. Even a line to escape. The White House Easter Egg Roll on Monday was a revealing look at the Obama administration's love of social engineering--and a chilling glimpse of what fate may befall the American people if they fail to rise up against it. The theme of the celebration was, predictably, fitness--an agenda couched in the friendly-seeming slogan, ""Ready, Set, Go!"" Kids were encouraged to participate in a variety of sports, including football, basketball, and hula-hoops. The purported reason was to get them in good physical shape. The real reason: to wear down their resistance, through physical exhaustion, to indoctrination. That indoctrination began before visitors even reached the entrance. While standing in line, attendees were forced to listen to a musical group called DJ Willy Wow! and Little Beat the No. 1 Chinchilla. Their message seemed harmless at first: ""There's a party going on/ on the White House lawn."" But soon they were endorsing political apathy, as the duo encouraged children to ""Put your hands in the air/ and wave them like you just don't care."" Once inside, families were presented with a variety of social control experiments. Foremost was the egg roll itself. Children lined up and, on ""go,"" proceeded to push their respective hard-boiled eggs across a small lawn. Not only does the practice of rolling eggs have no utility in the real world--a metaphor for the administration's useless ""job creation""--children were also encouraged to cheat. One parent literally held her daughter's arms like a marionette and scooped the egg forward across the finish line. Kids were also subjected to the gospel of local, organic food. Whole Foods passed out bags of fresh fruit, presumably to teach kids that they can expect free handouts in life. Across the way, kids learned to ""Eggspress"" themselves by creating plastic medallions with their names on them--a glorification of the empty consumerism of hip-hop culture. Local restaurants set up ""demo stations"" to show families how to make healthy snacks. However, they were not allowed to serve the food. ""We can't give free samples or the Secret Service will tackle us,"" said a man at the serving station for Moto, a high-end Chicago restaurant. ""They're not too fun."" Fun was apparently detained at the White House gate. At the Easter egg hunt, kids searched through hay for hard-boiled eggs, rather than eggs filled with candy, i.e., the kind of eggs a child would actually want to hunt for. At the egg-dyeing station, kids used child-safe egg tongs rather than the usual octagonal wire. It might poke an eye out! I hoped at the very least to crack open my egg and have a taste. Not so fast. ""Enjoy the beauty of your decorated eggs but please do not eat them,"" said a sign. ""They are not edible."" The musical performances were part of the messaging, as well. The television entertainment group Yo Gabba Gabba taught children to follow orders by instructing them to ""hop, hop, hop"" because it's ""fun, fun, fun."" The audience dutifully obeyed. They followed up with ""Party in My Tummy,"" an ode to cannibalism. The cast of  Glee! later performed a celebration of sexual desperation (""Somebody To Love""), a gay love ballad sung by two men (""Somewhere Over the Rainbow""), and the utopian anthem ""Don't Stop Believin' ."" Once the children had been sufficiently fatigued, plied with food, and artistically brainwashed, everyone gathered by the White House balcony to greet the first family. ""Can we go into Barack Obama's house?"" one child asked his father. ""No,"" his father replied, ""we have to stay out here."" The correct response, of course, is that it's not Obama's house, it's the American people's house. First to emerge was the Easter Bunny--a piece of choreography designed to fill the children's heads with positive associations, which then transferred directly to the next pseudo-deity to emerge: Barack Obama. ""Happy Easter, everybody,"" he said, failing to mention Jesus. Michelle Obama followed up with a pagan prayer: ""Let's say thank you to Mother Nature!"" She then proceeded to praise the benefits of fitness, organic food, and generic Canadian import Justin Bieber. The last elicited screams. Even the dissemination of the White House's famous souvenir wooden eggs was an exercise in government control. In order to keep the 30,000 guests moving through smoothly, these souvenirs were awarded only to those who left with their group at the designated time--an obvious behavioral ""nudge"" dreamed up by Cass Sunstein. And of course, there was rationing: ""Limit one egg per child,"" the program stated. ""No exceptions."" Become a fan of  Slateon Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/03/finreg_101.html	"Passing health care reform makes any legislative task look easy. But it's still unclear what financial regulatory reform--or FinReg, as it's known inside the Beltway--will look like, whether it will have any teeth, and when it will pass. The answers at this moment seem to be, respectively: complicated, no, and soon. This is all eerily familiar. The House has already passed its bill and is waiting for the full Senate to act. Senate Republicans are likely to extract concessions that House Democrats do not like. Powerful business lobbies are mobilizing their forces. Here, then, is a short history and quick summary of some of the major debates. When the House passed its version of the bill in December, it did so with 223 Democrats and zero Republicans. Senate Democrats don't have the luxury of partisanship. With only 59 votes, they'll need at least one Republican defector to overcome an inevitable filibuster. (Because the bill doesn't directly affect the budget, the reconciliation route isn't an option.) The task of finding that vote falls to Sen. Chris Dodd, chairman of the banking committee. It's so far proved difficult. Talks with Sen. Richard Shelby, his GOP committee counterpart, collapsed. When Dodd and Sen. Bob Corker failed to reach an agreement, Dodd decided to go it alone and bring his own bill to the full Senate. Although the bill offered by Dodd's House counterpart, Barney Frank, is in many ways tougher, the Dodd bill is probably a better road map for what the final policy will look like. But it's likely to be further tweaked--i.e., watered down--before it has enough votes to pass the Senate. Here are the most important components and how they're likely to change. The Consumer Financial Protection Agency. If there's a place for Republicans to plant their flag, it's here. The CFPA would regulate all kinds of credit, from mortgages to credit cards to payday loans, with an eye toward keeping lenders from exploiting consumers. Dodd originally pushed for an independent agency--the idea being that autonomy from other federal agencies would allow the CFPA to be more consumer-friendly--but scrapped that idea after Shelby objected that it would be too powerful. The latest version of the bill would house the CFPA within the Federal Reserve. But it would maintain some measure of independence by having its own budget and a presidential appointee at the helm. Expect Republicans to chip away further at its independence before the bill passes. Resolution authority. That's a fancy way of saying, ""When and how can regulators intervene if they think a firm is going under?"" The White House wants regulators--in many cases, the Fed--to deal with failing nonbank entities much like the FDIC currently deals with failing banks: The FDIC has broad leeway to intervene before a bank is even bankrupt. It can force the bank to change management and raise capital. If necessary, it can seize the bank. The Fed would have the same freedom to intervene with failing hedge funds and insurance providers, if Democrats have their way. Republicans would rather a firm be near-death before allowing regulators to intervene. The GOP is likely to win this one, as the Dodd bill already incorporates many of its changes. ""Too big to fail"" provisions. The crucial fix is an insurance policy for the largest financial institutions, which would have to pay dues into a $50 billion fund. That fund would then be used to bail them out if they start to sink. One downside to the policy is that it identifies which banks are ""too big to fail""--they're the ones contributing to the ""too big to fail"" fund--and would therefore be safer for investors. But supporters figure it's worth the tradeoff. Republicans also argue that this amounts to a bailout fund for banks--even though, as the last crisis proved, the alternative would be a taxpayer-funded bailout. Other provisions that would limit the size of banks have been all but scrapped. The ""Volcker rule,"" which would require banks to keep investment funds separate from commercial deposits, remains, but Dodd seems skeptical that it will survive. Simplified regulation. There are currently several agencies that can regulate banks: the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision. Dodd's bill would cut out the last of these. It would also limit the scope of the Fed to the largest banks and would put the FDIC in charge of smaller banks across the country. Early warning system. A nine-member board chaired by the treasury secretary would be in charge of sounding the alarm if a firm was about to go under. The politics of whistle-blowing would be extremely complex--how does the board decide whether to act, potentially destroying a major corporation, or to hold back, potentially destroying the entire economy? Still, it's better than nothing. Other issues. Democrats want to require that banks trade derivatives and other complex financial instruments through clearing houses. They're pushing for shareholder approval for executive compensation packages. They would also require that the originators of mortgage credit keep some of the risk, rather than selling all of it off. Republicans are resisting all of these measures. None of this means anything, of course, without an administration to enforce it. As Paul Krugman puts it, ""No system will work once President Palin gets to appoint the Secretary of the Treasury and the chairman of the Fed."" That's one reason Democrats are selling FinReg as now or never. (Another reason is November.) Of course, agencies do have the ability to act without congressional approval. They could raise capital and liquidity requirements for banks, for example. The reason they haven't yet is that it could make the credit crunch even worse, says Brookings Institution scholar Douglas Elliott. But if Dodd's bill falters in the Senate, renegade regulation may be the administration's only option. Become a fan of  Slate and the  Explainer on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/03/democrats_for_child_molestation.html	"Perhaps in recognition of Lent, Senate Republicans responded to the passage of health care reform this week by saying 147 Hail Marys. That is, they offered up 147 amendments designed to kill the reconciliation bill--or, at least, to cast it back into the fiery legislative bowels from whence it came. Vote-a-rama--the period before a bill's passage in which senators can offer up an unlimited number of amendments--serves two purposes. One is to eat up time. The two parties had 20 hours starting Wednesday to debate the amendments, and Republicans wanted to milk every last minute. The other purpose is to force the party in power to cast embarrassing votes. This health care reform bill already passed the House, so Senate Democrats were determined to vote down any amendment that would require another House vote. (It turns out that, for boring parliamentary reasons, the House has to vote again, anyway.) Republicans therefore wanted to make the ""poison pill"" amendments as hard to vote against as possible. If you can't beat them, the thinking goes, humiliate them. Hence the series of Republican amendments that, on the one hand, encapsulated the GOP opposition--David Vitter of Louisiana proposed a full repeal, for instance--but, on the other hand, were more Democratic than the Democrats. Vitter also proposed increasing women's access to breast-cancer screenings. Democrats voted it down. Utah's Orrin Hatch offered an amendment that would ""protect America's wounded warriors."" The heartless Democrats voted against it. Other amendments simply forced the Democrats to take ridiculous stances. When Tom Coburn of Oklahoma proposed prohibiting coverage of Viagra for child molesters--an issue sure to pop up in future campaign ads--Democrats voted against it. Republicans did show some restraint, however, by declining to offer an amendment banning kitten executions. The question is: Do these amendments actually do any damage? For the most part, no. There's a long history of forcing opposing parties to take embarrassing votes in order to pass important legislation, and some of them occasionally make it into 30-second attack ads. But it's usually the main bill, rather than the gimmicky stuff around the edges, that is remembered. ""This health care bill is like an aircraft carrier,"" says Randy Strahan, a political science professor at Emory University. ""These kinds of amendments are not going to stop it."" Plus, Democrats have given themselves procedural cover by voting to ""table"" the amendments, which is technically different from voting against them. Democrats can also avoid paying the price for awkward votes by introducing separate legislation to make their stances clear. For example, Republicans floated the idea of adding a public option amendment in order to force Democrats to vote against it. After some Democrats proposed a separate bill supporting a public option, Republicans dropped the idea. Sometimes, ""poison pill"" amendments do succeed at derailing legislation--but only when they actually make it into the bill. Jeff Sessions of Alabama amended a 2009 hate crimes bill to include the death penalty in the case of hate crimes, effectively killing the bill. In 2007, Jim DeMint of South Carolina derailed an immigration bill by voting in favor of a guest-worker program he had previously opposed. ""If it hurts the bill, I'm for it,"" DeMint told the Washington Post. Republicans in 2009 effectively killed a D.C. voting rights bill by introducing an amendment that would repeal many of the city's gun control laws. They can also haunt senators in ways those senators don't expect. When John Kerry said he voted for a $87 billion package to fund troops in Iraq before he voted against it, he didn't explain the context. The first vote was for a bill that would have chipped away at the Bush tax cuts. The second vote was for the Iraq funding alone. In other words, the reason he voted for it in the first place was, apparently, a poison pill. Occasionally, poison pills backfire. In 1964, conservative Southern politicians introduced an amendment to the Civil Rights Act that would ban sex-based discrimination in the workplace. The purpose was to kill the bill. Instead, it passed, gender bias and all. The modern-day equivalent would be Republicans adding an amendment creating a single-payer, government-run health care system--only to have Democrats vote for it. Become a fan of  Slate on Facebook.

11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/03/wtf_did_biden_just_say.html	"Joe Biden has proved that even after a year of debate over health care reform, not everything had been said. At a White House signing ceremony for the legislation, the vice president turned to the president and said, as he embraced Obama, ""This is a big fucking deal."" The remark was intended to be private but was picked up by the microphone at the podium. Let us now resolve that among the unenumerated duties of the vice president is to occasionally uncork an expletive in public. This is not Biden's first time. At a ceremony announcing funding for his beloved Amtrak, he was greeted by a former colleague as ""Mr. Vice President."" He replied, ""Give me a fucking break."" Biden's  predecessor famously used the same epithet in an exchange with a senator. *  And Vice President George H.W. Bush, when asked how he did against Geraldine Ferraro in the vice-presidential debates in 1984, said, ""We tried to kick a little ass."" Biden's remark may have been inappropriate for polite company, but it was apt. It summed up precisely the nature, scope and impact of the legislation better than any of the 627 words he had just spoken. He lavished such praise on the president, Obama was forced to stare at the floor just as my fabulous and accomplished children do when I tell everyone how fabulous and accomplished they are. It is easy to lament Biden's remark as yet another sign of our coarser modern age. But America has a long and honorable tradition of top elected officials using salty language. Teddy Roosevelt, FDR, Truman, JFK, LBJ, Nixon, Bush and Clinton all used rough language. Jimmy Carter did, too. (Though his best moment may have come when he didn't mean to: Speaking in Poland, he said ""I want to know the Polish people,"" which was translated into Polish as, ""I want to have carnal knowledge of the Polish people."") It is true that our first president was against it: Gen. George Washington issued ""General Orders on Profanity"" to his troops in 1776. Ronald Reagan appears to be the modern president who kept it cleanest. He didn't even write out swear words in his diary. (""I'll hail it as a great bipartisan solution,"" he wrote of his tax cutting plan. ""H--l! It's more than I thought we could get."") But he did sometimes resort to them in private conversation. We are more aware of this phenomenon now because there are more microphones (as opposed to private White House taping systems), and when something is picked up it rockets around the Web and the world. Even the reaction to the expletives is digital now. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs acknowledged Biden's remarks on Twitter: ""And yes Mr. Vice President, you're right."" People of a more sensitive nature might disapprove of this language, but it is a fact of politics. At times, it is necessary. There are instances in private conversation when the expletive is simply the most efficient way to convey meaning. It was in this mode that former President George W. Bush conveyed his blunt feelings about the relationship between Syria and Hezbollah. Ben Bradlee, in his introduction to his book  Conversations With Kennedy, captured the distinction precisely: ""This record is sprinkled with what some will consider vulgarity. They may be shocked. Others, like Kennedy and like myself, whose vocabularies were formed in the crucible of life in the World War II Navy in the Pacific Ocean, will understand instinctively. There is nothing inherently vulgar in the legendary soldier's description of a broken-down Jeep. ""The fucking fucker's fucked. Surely there is no more succinct, or even graceful, four-word description of that particular state of affairs."" This is the category that Vice President Biden's locution today occupies. It is also in this vein that White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel mostly operates, as chronicled expertly by Noam Scheiber of the New Republic (though the volume of Emanuel's production does raise questions about the nature of the contest he seems to be competing in and what kind of prize he's up for). There is a distinction, however, between the use of vulgar terms and vulgarity. The latter goes too far--in grossing everyone out, or in unveiling the insecurities of the user, or in simply being too mean. Its greatest practitioners were LBJ and Nixon. LBJ, for example, was vulgar on the question of Macy's window displays, Gerald Ford and gum chewing, tent etiquette and keepsakes obtained from subservient lawmakers. His salty language came directly at someone else's expense. (President Obama might come under this category because he called Kanye West a ""jackass,"" but he can make the argument that he was simply stating a verifiable fact.) Cheney falls more in the LBJ camp than Biden. When on the Senate floor he told Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy to go have intercourse with himself. Later, Cheney explained the experience had been a kind of purgative: ""I expressed myself rather forcefully and felt better off after I had done it."" Nixon is perhaps the greatest prizewinner in both categories. As a presidential candidate in 1960, he made an issue of Harry Truman's use of bad words like ""hell"" and ""son-of-a-bitch"" that now hardly get a blink. ""I'm very proud that President Eisenhower restored dignity and decency and, frankly, good language to the conduct of the presidency of the United States,"" he said. (This may have been because Truman used bad words to talk about Nixon, whom he disliked intensely.) Behind closed doors however, he seemed to uncork a new one with every turn of his reel-to-reel tape recorder. It makes sense when you think about it. He did start out as a vice president. Correction,  March 23, 2010: The article originally included mention of a profanity, aimed at a New York Times reporter, that the article incorrectly attributed to Dick Cheney. In fact, it was candidate Bush, not his running mate Cheney, who uttered the remark. (Return to the corrected sentence.) Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook.

12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/03/all_in.html	"President Obama has just completed the most arduous act of community organizing of his career. Two hundred and nineteen of his neighbors down the street joined together in the House of Representatives to pass historic health care legislation. Speaker Nancy Pelosi made it happen, but Obama worked harder and more intensely than he has on any other issue of his presidency. He made 92 direct pitches to Democratic members of the House, according to a White House tally. Last week he gave three speeches, culminating in an appeal to fellow Democrats more personal and philosophical than any he's given since taking office. This week the legislation goes to the Senate, where it will be difficult for Republicans to derail the bill (though they might be able to delay it). ""We rose above the weight of our politics. ... We are still a people capable of doing big things,"" said the president. ""I know this wasn't an easy vote for a lot of people but it was the right vote."" No matter what happens next, Obama's sucessful effort to reshape the country's social safety net is a turning point in his presidency. This is his project. Unlike the bailout of the auto companies or the stimulus package, health care reform was not a response to an emergency. Whether the Obama presidency is a diptych, triptych, or something even more complex, the first hinge will mark the time before health care and the time after health care. Obama didn't just work harder to clear this hurdle. He worked deeper, making his final pitch to provide insurance to 32 million people on moral grounds in a more focused way than he has in the last year of debate. Twice this past week he went to the presidential library for moral ballast. On Friday he quoted Teddy Roosevelt: ""Aggressively fighting for the right is the noblest sport the world affords."" On Saturday he built his speech to House Democrats around a quote from Lincoln that touched on the same sentiment--doing the right thing despite the odds.""I am not bound to win, but I'm bound to be true. I'm not bound to succeed, but I'm bound to live up to what light I have."" Presidents like to compare themselves to their successful predecessors. It adds to the nobility of their cause and allows them to bask in their reflected glory. But it was clear that when Obama spoke to House Democrats, he was not just reaching for rhetorical tricks. He spoke in personal terms and at length about their collective moral obligation. He talked about the impulse that moved them all to get into politics and that made them become Democrats. ""Something inspired you to get involved, and something inspired you to be a Democrat instead of running as a Republican,"" he said. ""Because somewhere deep in your heart you said to yourself, 'I believe in an America in which we don't just look out for ourselves, that we don't just tell people you're on your own.' "" The push to pass this bill has not only pushed him to use all of the tools of his office--speeches to the public, town halls with members of Congress, addresses to joint sessions of Congress, Q&A sessions shown over the Internet, Air Force One trips for undecided lawmakers, hours of one-on-one cajoling--but it has also pushed him rhetorically. It's one thing to say Republicans aren't participating in the health care process. The argument Obama made Saturday went further. As Obama framed it, only Democrats care about those less fortunate. The president continued his personal pitch, empathizing with lawmakers who had sacrificed so much for their office but often felt empty for the sacrifice. Tallying up all the promises lawmakers have made during their careers, Obama offered this one redeeming act to counter the feelings of emptiness: ""Every single one of you have made that promise not just to your constituents but to yourself.  And this is the time to make true on that promise."" The speech contained an important link all great presidents know how to make. It tied the case for fundamental change to enduring truths. This kind of language is to be expected at the end of a tough effort to convince lawmakers, especially after so many arguments have already been made. It also spoke to the enormous risks. (There would have been no need for a St. Crispen's Day speech if the French were the ones with the shabby, small army.) By asking his fellow Democrats to do something hard, Obama was really asking some of them to lose their jobs. He said he thought voting for the bill would turn out to be a political benefit for Democrats. He has to say that, but he's got to know it's a stretch. Health care legislation as the public understands it is unpopular. Voters do not view Obama's handling of the health care issue favorably. His overall disapproval rating is higher than his approval rating for the first time in his presidency. It will be difficult to change this dynamic before November, especially since Obama's powers of persuasion over the last year have been ineffective in changing public opinion on several issues. Given that grim landscape, Obama and congressional Democrats are making the purest test of whether voters want what they say they do--politicians who follow their conviction no matter what the consequences. That was a key promise of Obama's campaign, though so too was a new era of bipartisanship that is nowhere in evidence. Obama will have to finesse that as he takes to the campaign trail to campaign for all those undecided lawmakers he talked to this week. One strong point in his favor is now that health care has passed, he will be able to campaign in his strongest moral voice should he choose to--the voice that worked so well for him in 2008. One of the disasters of a loss on health care would have been that it would have relegated him to complaining about Republicans. That's not his best channel. He's much better--and voters like it much more--when he speaks of hope and uplift. When the Democrats hit 216 votes in the House, they chanted, ""Yes we can!,"" Obama's campaign slogan. Now Democrats and the White House have to hope that, having shown they can do something, the country will change its mind and decide that Congress should do it.

Republicans mostly kept their heads down. But a few Democrats dallied--partly to gloat, partly to pre-empt the electoral doomsayers. ""I feel more than gratified,"" said Rep. John Lewis. ""I feel like we're on the side of the angels."" Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., described Sunday's vote as just the first step in a Democratic surge. ""If we pass this and regulatory reform, this notion that liberals have to stay home in November becomes much less plausible."" Republicans focused their frustration on Rep. Bart Stupak, whose switch from ""no"" to ""yes"" after President Obama promised to sign an executive order prohibiting federal money from being spent on abortions pushed the Democrats over the 216-vote threshold. ""Stupak has to explain why he's no longer pro-life,"" said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., as he exited the chamber. At one point during Stupak's floor speech, someone shouted, ""Babykiller."" Rep. Dave Obey, D-Wis., who was presiding as speaker at the time, said he saw who shouted it but preferred not to snitch. ""Members have a right to make an idiot of themselves once without being identified,"" he said. Lewis, who reportedly had racial epithets shouted at him by anti-reform protesters over the weekend, declined to focus on the anger over health care reform: ""When historians pick up their pens to write the history of this period, they'll say a major party forgot about politics and did the right thing."" 11:12 p.m.--Everyone knew the votes were there. And they were: The Senate health care bill passed the House on Sunday night, 219-212. The final speeches by party leaders were therefore less about swaying votes one way or another than putting a final stamp on the legislation. Republicans chided their Democratic colleagues for flouting the will of the American people. ""Some say we're making history,"" said Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind. ""I think we're breaking history."" Democrats invoked history, too. ""This is the Civil Rights Act of the 21st Century,"" said Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi compared the vote to the historic passage of Medicare and Medicaid. House Minority Whip Eric Cantor criticized the Democrats' failure to achieve bipartisanship: ""The only bipartisanship has been in opposition,"" he said. He also claimed the bill would drive up the cost of health care, use federal funds to pay for abortions, and pile debt onto future generations. (The CBO says the bill will reduce the deficit by more than $1 trilllion over two decades.) Pelosi thanked President Obama and Edward Kennedy in her speech. She predicted that reform would ""unleash an entrepreneurial spirit"" in America. (Republicans laughed.) She got philosophical about what brought Democrats to this vote, riffing on an earlier line from Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga.: ""We may not have chosen the time, but the time has chosen us."" Minority Leader John Boehner used his time to deride the process that led to the bill's passage. ""Can you say it was done out in the open?"" he asked. His rhetorical device at times backfired. ""Do you really believe that if you like your health care plan, you can keep it?"" ""Yes!"" shouted Democrats. Boehner fired back, ""You can't!"" ""Yes we can!"" yelled Democrats. When the vote tally reached 216, a cheer went up stage right. Democrats hugged and kissed. Republicans stood with crossed arms. It didn't take long for Democrats to settle on their victory chant: ""Yes we can!"" AP Video: The House vote to pass health care reform. 6:48 p.m.--Finally, a vote on health care. The ""rule for debate"" has now passed the House, 224-206. That doesn't necessarily mean the health care bill itself will pass by that margin, but it's a sign that 224 Democrats don't mind moving the process forward. Twenty-eight Democrats voted against it. Now begins two hours of debate: one for Democrats, one for Republicans. 6:10 p.m.--The historic passage of health care reform may be an exciting moment, but Congress seems determined to make the process as unexciting as possible. Hence the various ""suspension"" bills being brought to the floor in the middle of the health care debate. The purported reason for suspension bills is to consider important issues facing the American people, such as naming post offices. The real reason is to give the Democrats time to whip votes and plot out strategy, while at the same time making sure members don't leave the building. A sampling of the bills Congress is pausing everything to consider: H.R. 4840--To designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1979 Cleveland Avenue in Columbus, Ohio, as the ""Clarence D. Lumpkin Post Office.""  H.Res. 1174--Supporting the goals and ideals of National Women's History Month.  H.Res. 1075--Commending the members of the Agri-business Development Teams of the National Guard for their efforts, together with personnel of the Department of Agriculture and the United States Agency for International Development, to modernize agriculture practices and increase food production in war-torn countries.  H.Res. 1099--Recognizing the 65th anniversary of the Battle of Iwo Jima. H.Res. 925--Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the meritorious service performed by aviators in the United States Armed Forces who were shot down over, or otherwise forced to land in, hostile territory yet evaded enemy capture or were captured but subsequently escaped. H.Res. 900--Supporting the goals and ideals of a Cold War Veterans Recognition Day to honor the sacrifices and contributions made by members of the Armed Forces during the Cold War and encouraging the people of the United States to participate in local and national activities honoring the sacrifices and contributions of those individuals. H.Res. 1119--Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that all people in the United States should participate in a moment of silence to reflect upon the service and sacrifice of members of the United States Armed Forces both at home and abroad As a result, it's past 6 p.m. and Congress is only now voting to approve the rules for debate--a vote that was originally scheduled to occur around 2 p.m. At this rate, Steny Hoyer may have to TiVo The Pacific. 5:16 p.m.--If you believe everything you read, Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., spent the first half of Sunday frantically changing his position on health care. MSNBC says he's a yes! The Hill says he's a no! CNN says yes! Nancy Pelosi says she's not sure! That suspense quickly dissipated at 4 p.m. today, when Stupak announced that he would be voting for the bill and that his coalition of anti-abortion Democrats would likely push Nancy Pelosi over the 216-vote threshold necessary to pass the bill. ""We are well past 216,"" he told reporters at a press conference. The final straw: A promise by President Obama to sign an executive order prohibiting federal funds from being spent on abortion in the health care exchanges. The crowd outside, however, wasn't buying it. Ben Grace of Culpeper, Va., took issue with the notion that Obama can control federal funds by executive order. ""If he can sign an executive order knocking down that law, why can't he do that for any law he wants?"" Other protesters acknowledged that the bill would pass but argued that the consequences will be severe. ""I think it could get really ugly,"" said Leslie Howard-Redwik of Knox, Ind. ""Like, in a National Guard sense."" Grace pointed out that his home state of Virginia has promised to sue the federal government, claiming it can't force people to buy health insurance. Another thing that bothers Grace: The prospect of the federal government accessing his health records. ""If my doctor divulges this, I'll sue his pants off,"" he says. When news of Stupak's switch reached the protesters, a new chant erupted: ""We want Stupak!"" 4:25 p.m. WASHINGTON--Chaos reigns at the Capitol. It's just hard to say whether it's crazier outside the building or inside. As House Democrats began the final slog toward voting on health care reform--an 11-step process that began at noon Sunday--protesters gathered on the Capitol's south lawn, waving signs and chanting, ""Kill the bill!"" and ""Naaaaancy!"" Republican members of Congress periodically emerged and waved from the balcony, to cheers. Rep. Steve King, R-N.Y., dangled a ""Don't Tread on Me"" flag, while another Republican held up a giant ""No!"" sign. Some Democrats braved the hordes, as well: Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., ventured out and got booed. Earlier, Nancy Pelosi linked arms with the Democratic leadership and Rep. John Lewis and walked across the Capitol plaza while protesters called her ""a disgrace to your office."" The scene inside the Capitol wasn't much saner. Soon after members of Congress first started filing into the chamber, a protester leapt up and started shouting, ""Kill the bill! The people said no!"" As security ushered him out, at least a dozen Republicans cheered from the floor. Later, Rules Committee Chairwoman Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., got into a shouting match with Rep. David Drier, D-Calif., over who held the floor, while the speaker, Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill., repeatedly slammed his gavel. The legislative process seemed almost designed to maximize the insanity. First, the House has to vote on the ""rule"" that determined how the rest of the votes would proceed. (As of 4:30, they were still debating the rule.) After that, debate begins on the Senate health care bill, followed by a vote, followed by debate on the reconciliation bill, followed by a vote. All told, we're looking at about 12 hours of yelling, chanting, and grandstanding--both on the floor and off. Check back here for more. Become a fan of  Slate on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/03/fear_of_votearama.html	"The process for passing health care reform can at times sound like one of those e-mails from a generous foreign banker. I am pleased to be consulting you on behalf of the Nigerian Trust and Mercantile Exchange to request your assistance deeming the Senate health care bill as passed. For the moment, the public focus is on the House's ""self-executing rule,"" an effort by House Democrats to get around voting on the unpopular Senate health care bill. Under that back-bend, members would vote on a 100-page House bill of popular fixes to the roughly 2,000-page Senate bill. Passage of this smaller bill would automatically ""deem"" that the larger Senate bill had passed. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she is leaning toward this approach because no one would have to actually vote on a bill he or she doesn't like (one of the impediments she faces as she tries to line up the 216 votes she needs to pass health care legislation). But House Democrats aren't going through all this just out of cowardice. Part of what is requiring them to be so creative is the unpredictability of the coming reconciliation process in the Senate. Under the Democrats' current plan, Senate reconciliation is the last stage in the health care reform drama. But to get to that stage, House Democrats must cast votes based on the hope that the Senate follows through. They're understandably nervous this might not happen. The Senate reconciliation process is unpredictable and confusing. It sounds straightforward enough: The Senate will have 20 hours of debate, followed by consecutive votes on amendments. The mischief comes in two ways: from challenges to the content of the bill and from the political implications of the amendments. Reconciliation limits debate  and allows passage of a bill by a simple majority. Under its rules, all items in the bill being considered must pass a series of tests to prove that they are related to the budget. If Republicans challenge a provision on these grounds, the Senate parliamentarian must rule whether it passes the tests. Because the central reconciliation rules were written by Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd, the puns get fowl quickly. Meetings to determine what can stay in or out of a bill are known as ""Byrd baths,"" and items that fall out are known as ""Byrd droppings."" If the Senate parliamentarian says a provision does not qualify to be part of a reconciliation bill, it is taken out of the bill. (His rulings can only be overturned by 60 votes, which the Democrats don't have.) If the bill is changed, it is diverted from its path to the president's desk--because once altered, the bill must return to the House for a vote. Democrats want to avoid this outcome because it will require Nancy Pelosi to find 216 votes all over again. Even if she can find the votes, the delay means more time spent bickering and not talking about jobs and the economy, the issues Democrats--and voters--really want to talk about. The next chance for procedural mayhem comes during ""vote-a-rama"" (not like the PBS kids series, though potentially just as childish). This is the period after debate during which the Senate votes on amendments. There's little or no debate on the individual amendments--just straight voting with no break through the day and night. All senators must be present for the votes. This could be a stamina test more like the Jimmy Stewart version of a filibuster in  Mr. Smith Goes to Washington than the process that now has that name. Amendments during vote-a-rama can include anything--they needn't be related to budget issues--and the person who submits them can ask that they be read. Bob Dole once attached the United States Code, which includes all U.S. statutes, to one amendment. (Dole ultimately relented after he got what he wanted.) Before they drop from exhaustion, Republicans will seek to make Democrats take one brutal vote after another. They will introduce amendments designed to look popular but which, if they pass, will alter the bill, requiring that it go back to the House, causing delay and possible derailment. To avoid this, Democrats will have to defeat every Republican amendment, momentarily embracing the title of the Party of No. Republicans are working to craft amendments targeted for maximum political impact--amendments to help small business by exempting them from tax increases or bolstering Medicare. When Democrats vote no, Republicans will try to use it as an issue in the fall election. If Democrats hold firm, Republicans will seek to use the vote-a-rama to keep driving home their argument that Democrats are trying to force the health care bill on the American people. This sounds like a silly charade, and it is. But House Democrats are sufficiently worried their Senate colleagues may buckle under the pressure of having to take so many unpopular no votes that they're trying to build themselves a political way out. If the Senate fails to pass the reconciliation bill, only its original bill will have become law, which means House Democrats will be stuck having to defend its unpopular special deals for states like Nebraska and Florida. The self-executing rule seeks to limit their political exposure because House lawmakers can then say they never actually voted for the Senate bill. Their goal is the same as the person writing those e-mails from Nigerian bankers: Design a process so that even if everything goes wrong, you won't get caught.

15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/04/the_bush_restoration_project.html	"Jeffrey Scott Shapiro talks about George W. Bush the way Buddhists talk about the Dalai Lama. ""He stands for truth, compassion and freedom,"" he says. ""Bush instinctively sees the global picture that every living person has the right to be free."" It's hardly surprising, then, that Shapiro founded Honor Freedom, an organization devoted to restoring Bush's reputation. And Shapiro may actually succeed--especially since Bush, too, will be working on the same project, if not the same organization. On its Web site, Honor Freedom proclaims its three-part mission: ""UNITE BUSH SUPPORTERS by building a national network"" of supporters; ""CORRECT THE HISTORICAL RECORD by dispelling fallacies about President Bush""; and ""TEACH AMERICA the truth about the Bush foreign policy doctrine"" (all capitalization in original). Through a nationwide public education program consisting of op-eds, media appearances, and free public seminars, the nonprofit group intends to teach Americans that George W. Bush was actually a great president and an even better man. Honor Freedom is independent of the George W. Bush Presidential Center, which consists of the official Bush library and foundation. It has no ties to Bush, and a spokeswoman at the foundation says she's never heard of Shapiro's group. Presidential libraries and related foundations may serve to burnish their namesakes' reputations, but they are ""not as crass or overt as this,"" says H.W. Brands, who has written biographies of Andrew Jackson, Teddy Roosevelt and FDR. Shapiro, for his part, has written that ""relying on a passive institute such as a presidential library and waiting for people to learn the truth on their own will not be sufficient in this unique case."" Having launched his project in January on  Strategy Room, Fox News' online show, Shapiro has yet to focus on fundraising. But he has organizers in eight states--and a representative in Australia!--and has recruited Andrew Breitbart as communications director and Bush's former deputy assistant Brad Blakeman as ""chief adviser."" To listen to Shapiro is to travel back in time to 2003, when present-day critics like David Frum were calling Bush ""The Right Man."" Even now, Shapiro's defense of the Bush administration's record in Iraq is pretty much unqualified. Bush's critics ""are selfish people who don't see the value of national liberation,"" he says. ""They are isolationists who don't care that the U.S. freed a people enslaved by fear."" To charges that Bush is unintelligent, he says: ""Bush is clearly very smart. And you don't need to be a genius to be president--you need good leadership skills and good instincts."" To the rap that his economic record is woeful, Shapiro says that Bush was a foreign-policy president. ""He dealt with the first major attack on the continental United States since 1812 and responded brilliantly. He was a great leader."" Not all conservatives are eager to return to the partisan battles of the aughts, however. ""Clearly how independents voted in 2006 and 2008 was in reaction to Bush,"" says Republican pollster Glen Bolger. ""2010 and 2012 is about the future for Republicans. They're not going to want to look back."" But Shapiro downplays past elections and polls, which put Bush's end-of-term approval rating at a record-low 22 percent. In his travels, he says, he finds that the president is very popular. ""People all over the country love him."" Shapiro also claims the support of Bush, though the former president is not involved in Honor Freedom.  Shapiro recently stayed for a week at the home of Bush's nephew, Pierce, who introduced the two. * ""You're doing good work,"" Shapiro says the former president told him.  Shapiro says he regularly exchanges e-mail with Karl Rove, and Blakeman says he's had conversations with other former members of Bush's staff who are excited about Honor Freedom. Shapiro's views of the media were shaped by experience. After covering the JonBenet Ramsey case for the Globe tabloid as a reporter, he voluntarily reported his editors to the FBI for criminal violations and testified against them in a grand jury as a key witness. Shapiro says his coverage of the Ramsey case and the Chandra Levy case led him to resent the media's abuse of the First Amendment, which ""probably led to my feelings about the media lies told about President Bush."" After leaving the media, Shapiro went to law school and worked for Sen. John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election--and then worked as a prosecutor for the District of Columbia. * And though Shapiro's cause may seem unlikely, it's possible--even likely--that Bush's popularity will at least partially recover. ""The surest likelihood that a president's reputation will rise after he is out of office is low approval ratings when he leaves office,"" says Brands.  Jimmy Carter left office in 1981 * viewed as a failure, but he is thought by the public to be the best living ex-president, according to a recent Rasmussen poll. One of Bush's role models, Harry Truman, was so unpopular in 1952 that he left office rather than run for reelection. Now he is often considered among the five best U.S. presidents. Even so, it will be a long road. The Bush restoration, if it comes, may not occur in Bush's lifetime--or Shapiro's. There was zero net job creation in the first decade of the 2000s, for the first time in nearly a century. The economy is still fragile, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are far from over. ""No recent president has had the problems Bush has had,"" says Jean Edward Smith, who has written books on Ulysses S. Grant, George H. W. Bush, and FDR. ""They haven't had so much to explain away."" Their methods vary, but the foremost goal and truest vocation of every ex-president is to defend his presidency. Bush is no different. Along with former President Clinton, he led the U.S. response to the earthquake in Haiti. He appeared at a ""Conference on Cyber Dissidents"" this week hosted by his presidential center. And he is thickening his wallet giving speeches to friendly audiences. Bush may have a harder time than any president since Carter in getting back in the good graces of the public.

16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/04/posterity.html	"Among the many criticisms of Twitter, the most common by far is that no one cares what you ate for breakfast. In fact, quite a few people care. ""I actually think it's very useful,"" says Paul Freedman, a professor at Yale University who studies the history of food. For him, a 140-character ode to your KFC Double Down--along with the worshipful photo you took before devouring it--could be a priceless historical document. ""Historians are interested in ordinary life,"" Freedman says. ""And Twitter is an incredible resource for ordinary life."" Hence the decision by the Library of Congress last week to store the complete archives of Twitter. Starting six months from now, every last tweet--currently produced at a rate of 50 million a day--will be saved on an LoC hard drive and will presumably be accessible to historians for ... well, forever. Digital archiving isn't anything new. A nonprofit digital library called the Internet Archive started collecting snapshots of the World Wide Web in 1996. University libraries regularly scan their research collections to make them accessible on the Web. Google Books is currently scanning the books of at least 20 major research libraries. But the decision to archive Twitter takes digital preservation to a new level of detail. In the past, all archives, even digital ones, had to be selective. The Internet Archive doesn't preserve every last byte of the Web--only the seemingly important parts. The Twitter archive, by contrast, will be mind-numbingly complete. Everything from reactions to the uprising in Iran to Robert Gibbs' first tweet to your roommate's two-sentence analysis of Hot Tub Time Machine will be saved for posterity. Which is, from a historian's perspective, historic. Now that we've started logging all the stray thoughts hurled into cyberspace, the prospect of recording every last word ever published--to paraphrase archivist Brewster Kahle, we're ""one-upping the Greeks""--doesn't seem especially crazy. The question is, does the preservation of digital content, from tweets to Facebook updates to blog comments, make the job of historians easier or harder? The answer is: both. On the one hand, there's more useful information for historians to sift. On the other, there's more useless information. And without the benefit of hindsight, it's impossible to tell which is which. It's like what John Wanamaker supposedly said about advertising: He knew half of it was wasted, he just didn't know which half. The trick will be organization. Hashtags--the # symbols people use to create discussion threads, such as #ashtag for the Iceland volcano cloud and #snowpocalypse for the February snowstorm that swept Washington, D.C.--are a start. But many tweeters don't bother to tag their posts. Historians will probably be able to search by keyword. But that can lead them astray, too. How do you know if someone is complaining about the windows in their house or the Windows on their computer? Data-mining has become sophisticated enough to make these distinctions based on context. Sometimes that means looking at other keywords surrounding a keyword. (If the word ""laptop"" appears near ""Windows,"" for example, the author is probably talking about software.) It could also mean looking at metadata--when the tweet was sent, where it was sent from, whom the person is following and vice versa. Twitter has no plans to share public metadata with the LoC, but a spokesman says it would be ""open to discussing this with them."" Whether historians can make sense of this data depends on the tools they have to sort through it. ""This is what historians have always done: they create order out of chaos,"" says Martha Anderson, the director of the LOC's National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program. ""It's kind of like saying, 'Are newspapers useful for historians?'"" says Elaine Tyler May, a history professor at the University of Minnesota and president of the Organization of American Historians. * ""We know that they are, but you have to know what you're looking for."" Save it all, says history professor Dan Cohen. You never know what people will do with it. Cohen heads up the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. After 9/11, the center created an archive that included tens of thousands of personal stories from that day. When researchers later looked at the server logs to see who had visited, they found some visitors were linguists studying teen slang. Someone else browsed the archive while researching cell phone usage, since many of the stories involved cell phones. ""That's the power of a large scale open archive,"" Cohen says. Movements in historiography are usually influenced by politics. In the 1960s and '70s, for example, bottom-up social history rather than the ""great men"" approach to scholarship became popular in academia. But technology can also breed new kinds of history. Go back to the food example. Culinary historians who study the 1950s have limited source materials. ""You can read cookbooks, you can read restaurant reviews, you can read write-ups in the New Yorker,"" says Nicolaas Mink, a lecturer on food history at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point. ""But you don't get a sense of how that food is actually being prepared or being received by ultimate consumer."" Twitter is a font of amateur food criticism--exactly what a historian interested in broad social attitudes toward food would be looking for. Or take the history of adolescents. The source material for studying how and what kids think has always been limited to school papers, letters from parents and teachers, the occasional diary. Again, mostly ""top-down"" history. There's little real-world data about how kids interact with each other. Blogs, tweets, and Facebook updates offer glimpses into the lives of children on a scale that no randomized study could re-create. Twitter as historical document would also allow scholars to trace phenomena in real time. Historians have long tried to reconstruct how word of AIDS spread in New York in the early 1980s. But it's hard to document who knew what when. ""A lot of those conversations are lost except for people like me who might remember the time 30 years ago,"" says David Mindich, a journalism professor at Saint Michael's College. Twitter preserves those cultural moments. Google has already created a program called Replay that maps Twitter topics over time. There are limits to what Twitter can tell us. Part of the problem is selection bias. Tweets are designed for public consumption. As Mindich put it: ""If you're looking at what someone ate for breakfast, you're also looking at what someone wants everyone to think they ate for breakfast."" Or consider Facebook photos. If a sociologist conducted a study of college student behavior based on pictures tagged on Facebook, he would assume 98 percent of a student's time was spent clutching red Solo cups. Data collected from Twitter could also suffer from unreliability. ""It will be the job of historians to verify,"" says Elaine Tyler May. Of course, selection bias is always an issue. The letters preserved in someone's archive are the letters lovingly set aside for preservation. Perhaps the slapdash quality of tweets makes them more reliable as historical documents. No one broadcasts the mouth feel of the KFC Double Down with a mind to posterity--at least they didn't until the LoC announced its plan. One could argue that a lot less calculation goes into a tweet than into, say, the collected letters of William Jefferson Clinton. That said, Twitter historiography will be relatively cut-and-dry, since it's all public. The real challenge will be figuring out what happens to private digital missives, like the contents of someone's Gmail account. Google's current policy is to transfer a dead person's account to relatives if they provide the right paperwork. But what happens 100, 200, 500 years from now, when the public interest in opening someone's e-mail account outweighs the private interest in keeping it secret? ""It's a matter of time,"" says Martha Anderson of the LoC. ""But I feel like if anyone looked at my Gmail account, they'd think this is a boring woman who just shops all the time."" Which, for future historians studying consumption patterns in early 21st-century America, could be downright fascinating.Correction,  April 21, 2010: This article originally identified May as a professor at the University of Wisconsin.

17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/04/hegemoron.html	"Sarah Palin thinks Barack Obama is a wimp. She's been going around to Tea Party rallies, invoking the spirit of revolutionary Boston and castigating Obama for failing to exalt American power and punish our adversaries. She seems blissfully unaware that the imperial arrogance she's preaching isn't how the American founders behaved. It's how the British behaved, and why they lost. Palin represents everything the original Tea Party was against. Two months ago, the modern Tea Party held its national convention in Tennessee. There, Palin ridiculed Obama for ""reaching out to hostile regimes, writing personal letters to dangerous dictators and apologizing for America."" ""We need a strong national defense,"" she demanded. ""We must spend less time courting our adversaries."" Last week, at a tax-day rally in Boston, she resumed her attack. Tea Party activists ""will never apologize for being American,"" she snarked. Our military power is ""a force for good throughout this world, and that is nothing to apologize for."" She even implied a divine right to fossil fuel. ""God knows we have the resources,"" she told the crowd. ""He created them for our use right here in America."" On Friday, she lit into Obama for saying that America is a superpower ""whether we like it or not."" On her Facebook page, she asked, ""Mr. President,is a strong America a problem?"" She accused Obama of being ""more comfortable with an American military that isn't quite so dominant,"" and she faulted him for trying ""to apologize for America when he travels overseas."" On Saturday, she told reporters, ""I would hope that our leaders in Washington, D.C., understand we like to be a dominant superpower. I don't understand a world view where we have to question whether we like it or not that America is powerful."" What exactly are the apologies and misgivings for which Palin holds Obama in such contempt? One is his speech in Cairo last year, in which he conceded that ""Iraq was a war of choice that provoked strong differences in my country and around the world."" In the speech, Obama said that ""events in Iraq have reminded America of the need to use diplomacy and build international consensus."" He quoted Thomas Jefferson: ""I hope that our wisdom will grow with our power, and teach us that the less we use our power the greater it will be."" The other target of Palin's criticism is Obama's press conference at last week's Nuclear Security Summit, in which he argued that ""so many of the challenges that we face internationally can't be solved by one nation alone."" He cited Russia's help in reducing nuclear weapons stockpiles, and he noted that the United States couldn't bring peace to the Middle East without Israeli and Palestinian cooperation. Nevertheless, Obama said that the United States must work to resolve such conflicts, ""because whether we like it or not, we remain a dominant military superpower, and when conflicts break out, one way or another we get pulled into them. And that ends up costing us significantly in terms of both blood and treasure."" So when Obama said ""like it or not,"" he was expressing misgivings about costly faraway wars, not about power. But that isn't what makes Palin's argument so stupid. What makes it stupid is that it's how Britain botched the Boston Tea Party and squandered its empire. On Dec. 16, 1773, colonial dissidents famously protested British taxation without representation by dumping shiploads of tea into Boston Harbor. According to John C. Miller's  Origins of the American Revolution, British hawks responded exactly as Palin now recommends: by focusing on ego, power, and dominance. They called the Tea Party a ""wanton and unprovoked insult"" and proposed ""to blow the town of Boston about the ears of its inhabitants."" King George III declared, ""We must master them or totally leave them to themselves and treat them as Alien."" The British hawks, like Palin, saw self-restraint as wimpy and dangerous. If Britain retreated from the tax policies that had provoked the Tea Party, they warned, the colonists would take this as ""Proofs of our Weakness, Disunion and Timidity."" Miller writes, ""Few Englishmen believed that the mother country could retain its sovereignty if it retreated in the face of such outrage: it was now said upon every side that the colonists must be chastised into submission."" Palin thinks American power is above apology because it's ""a force for good throughout this world."" But Britain saw itself the same way. In their own eyes, Miller explains, Englishmen,"	Sarah Palin's ignorant imperialism.

So goes the life of a shortlister for a Supreme Court vacancy in this age of no-holds-barred 24/7 news/blogs/tattletales. We can't help thinking back, with some nostalgia, to those gentler 1980s days when David Souter's unmarried status caused him no such public grief--even after he was nominated and up for confirmation. We join the blogger who wrongly outed Kagan in hoping that since the White House has now spoken, everyone will simply shut up, as they should have in the first place, unless they have some evidence to back up their gossip. Who is and isn't a lesbian got some play last year, when a group of women were on the shortlist for the Supreme Court seat eventually filled by Justice Sonia Sotomayor. One potential nominee, Stanford professor Pamela Karlan, confirmed that she was gay. The other potential nominees, and Kagan, said nothing at all about the matter. Presumably she thought it was all nobody's business and has held out the hope that the press would respect her privacy. Not this time. First Marc Ambinder made the speculation semi-respectable by couching it in terms of a ""baffling whisper campaign"" by other people: both gay rights folks and conservatives. Then CBSNews.com posted a piece by blogger Ben Domenech--who blogged for the Washington Post briefly in 2006, until he got pelted with plagiarism charges--who announced that Kagan was ""openly gay."" To this he soon added an even more inflammatory ""correction"": ""I have to correct my text here to say that Kagan is apparently still closeted--odd, because her female partner is rather well known in Harvard circles."" The White House said, off the record, that Domenech's claim was false and railed at CBS for its poor journalistic standards. Domenech apologized. CBSNews.com removed the offending post (a bad Web practice--better to leave the record of embarrassment intact and write a big mea culpa at the top, rather than trying to pretend it never happened). More on the whole mess from Howard Kurtz here. Why was Kagan's sexuality blogging fodder to begin with? While he may have done it with the best of ironic intentions, Ambinder described her as ""a woman who has short hair, favors pant suits, hasn't married, and doesn't seem to be in a relationship."" Wow. Anita Dunn, who is working with the White House on the vacancy, says this is about ""applying old stereotypes to single women with successful careers."" We have to agree. Name a 49-year-old women with three kids and a hope in hell of making it to the court. There's a reason there are few mommies on that short list. (Judge Diane Wood, who has been divorced and has kids, is an exception.) Kagan also gets called ""gay friendly"" because as dean of Harvard Law School, she was a spirited backer of the lawsuit brought by several law schools challenging the Solomon Amendment, Congress' effort to stop the schools from treating military recruiters differently from other prospective employers. (Some schools did not allow the military to interview students on campus because of the inequity of ""don't ask, don't tell."") Kagan was one of 40 law professors who signed onto a court brief in the case, making a slightly different argument. Eight other universities filed briefs along with 56 Columbia University law professors and 44 Yale law professors. Are they all of them now disqualified from court service as well? Kagan spoke out at the time, saying ""The military policy that we at the law school are overlooking is terribly wrong, terribly wrong in depriving gay men and lesbians of the opportunity to serve their country."" Kagan said what many law professors at Harvard--almost all of them, according to her--felt. It doesn't mean she has prejudged whether there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. It means she thought denying gay students the opportunity to serve was unfair. The suggestion that this tips Kagan's hand on other gay rights cases that will come before the court is tantamount to suggesting that Ruth Bader Ginsburg should have been disqualified because, as a lawyer working on landmark sex discrimination cases in the 1970s, she had prejudged all ""gender"" issues. The White House response to the Kagan flap has some of the hallmarks of a post-racial, post-affirmative-action, post-labels president. Like Obama's new executive order requiring same-sex couples to be allowed hospital visitation, it's couched in the language of equality, not specialness. As James Joyner points out, that order applies to more than just gay partners. It makes it easier for all kinds of unmarried people to see their loved ones when they're sick. Writes Joyner: ""it sounds like Obama is ordering a very broad right of hospital visitors to designate whomever they wish be allowed to visit and carry out medical decisions. This will have a disparate impact on homosexuals, of course, but it bypasses the 'special rights' argument that opponents of gay rights typically cite."" There's just permission for your own near and dear to visit. In, out, gay straight, nobody gets outed, but everyone gets visitation. At the same time, the White House may have disserved the cause by making such a fuss about the CBS piece. The real answer needn't be the insistence that Kagan is straight. It should be that it matters not one little bit. Period. The White House may be hoping that Kagan's sexual preference is a nonissue for most Americans, especially at the moment when anti-gay-rights groups change their message from ""we don't want gay-friendly nominees"" to ""gay nominees are all sinful,"" as Focus on the Family has just done. Whether or not the strategy works politically, the White House's announcement that Kagan isn't gay should end the matter, unless and until someone come up with some real proof to the contrary. The unfounded insistence that Kagan is a lesbian isn't about lies or hypocrisy (shades of, oh, Larry Craig and John Edwards) or even journalistic ethics. It's about making things up. There's simply no evidence that Kagan's pretending to be anything she's not. The underlying lesson may be that the confirmation wars are so completely toxic that we have come to assume every nominee reflexively lies about everything, up to and including his or her sexuality.

20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/04/thin_reid.html	"Speaking at a rally in Las Vegas on Saturday, Sen. Harry Reid promised to pass immigration reform in 2010. ""There are no excuses. This is something America needs,"" Reid said. ""We're going to do immigration reform just like we did health care reform."" If by that he means with long delays, confusing starts and stops, obsessions over provisions that never make it into the bill, and despair followed by sudden resurrection and historic passage, then he could be right. It's just hard to imagine all that happening this year, let alone before election season. The biggest problem is the calendar. Right after stepping off the campaign trail, Reid said that the Senate will not be tackling immigration reform during this work period, which extends through the end of May. Instead, they'll be tackling jobs bills, food-safety legislation, financial regulatory reform, and a bill that would address campaign finance and the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision. That leaves June and July for the Supreme Court nomination, an energy bill (which seems to keep slipping down the list), and whatever priorities they didn't manage to address in the spring. Congress takes August off, and after that the members will be campaigning. All this is not to say Reid can't squeeze in immigration reform. But for that to happen, everything would have to go according to plan--which, if health care reform was any indication, is unlikely. Also, Reid's promise Saturday was eerily similar to one he made last year. Then there's the matter of votes. Reid says he has 56 votes for a bill, the exact contours of which remain unclear. He needs four more. But there are enough Democrats firmly against reform that the remaining four would have to be mostly or all Republicans, according to a Daily Kos analysis. You'd think that would be simple, given that 12 Republicans--including Lindsay Graham, Judd Gregg, John Kyl, John McCain, and Olympia Snowe--voted in favor of immigration reform in 2007. But just because they supported it then doesn't mean they support it now. That was a different bill under a Republican president. For example, Obama's version probably wouldn't include a temporary guest worker program favored by Republicans. (Labor unions have always opposed the idea.) It may also include a biometric identification card to help employers verify that their employees are legal immigrants, which freaks out civil liberties advocates on the left and small-government conservatives on the right, despite efforts to pitch it as just a high-tech Social Security card. Lastly, there's the politics. Sure, passing a bill would help Reid, whose state is a quarter Hispanic. And the Latino vote has been a ""key demographic"" for both parties for so long that it can probably retire the title. But Democrats less reliant on Latino turnout would be criticized for putting the economy in danger during a recession. Some economists, including Robert Reich, argue that immigration reform would actually help the economy and reduce the deficit by bringing more young people into the taxpaying fold. Others argue it would boost GDP in the long run. But that's a tough sell to voters focused on holding down jobs now. Harry Reid can do whatever he wants, of course. He's the majority leader. And what he wants may simply be to show he made a good-faith effort, after which everybody can go home. It's like his recent pledge to revive the public option even though it had no chance of passing. He got points for trying--or appearing to try. Likewise with immigration reform. Whether or not a bill reaches the Senate floor, Reid wins. Actual reform is just a bonus. Become a fan of  Slate on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/04/pick_your_battle.html	"When a Supreme Court justice retires, the administration always says it will replace him or her with the best person for the job. Who's ""best,"" of course, depends on a lot more than raw talent. There's also race, ideology, religion, and the nominee's command of Perry Mason trivia. Sometimes, though, what matters most is how hard the administration feels like fighting. This being an election year, the difficulty of pushing a nominee through the Senate confirmation hearings--a soul-deadening process at best, party-destroying at worst--may be a bigger factor than usual. Here, then, is a reverse-engineered look at the kinds of fights Obama may have to choose from--and, in each case, some nominees he might pick to get there. The Free Pass. Sometimes, the opposition barely puts up a fight. Think Justice John Roberts, who won 78 votes (not including then-Sen. Obama's) in the Senate in 2005: Sterling credentials, affable demeanor, and hard to pin down with ""how would you rule if ..."" questions. The most likely candidate for such a love fest is Merrick Garland, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Garland is considered the most moderate of the names being floated--he's got a centrist record on the D.C. court and is reportedly close with Roberts, his former colleague there--and thus the one with the best shot of being confirmed. He obviously wouldn't be a Republican president's first choice, but senators in the GOP figure that under a Democratic administration, he's the best they're going to get. The Fake Fight. This is when the opposition knows it can't win--and may not even really want to--but needs to put on a show so as not to look completely spineless. This round's likely pick: Solicitor General and former Harvard Law School dean Elena Kagan. Kagan is liberal, but won over conservatives during her tenure at Harvard by hiring Bush administration lawyers John Manning and Jack Goldsmith and reaching out to conservative student groups. Kagan also has the advantage of not being a judge and therefore having no paper trail of controversial decisions. On the other hand, her lack of courtroom experience became an issue during her nomination hearing for solicitor general in March 2009. She was confirmed, with 31 Republicans voting against her. If she passed then, of course, she would probably pass now. The Substantive Fight. It can be hard to differentiate this category from the previous one. But in general, under this scenario there is real push-back--enough to hurt the party and the nominee but not enough to derail the nomination entirely. Diane Wood, currently a judge on the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, would face strong opposition, largely for her decisions in controversial abortion cases. If Obama picked a gay nominee, like Stanford law professors Kathleen Sullivan or Pamela Karlan, the debate would inevitably swing toward gay marriage. Neither scenario is ideal for Obama, who would probably rather avoid an election-year summer clogged with hot-button social issues. Hillary Clinton's name has been floated as well, particularly because senators (and former senators) supposedly encounter less opposition among their own kind. Still, given her pseudo-scandals of the '90s and role as a politicizing force, Republicans may find it hard to turn away from a fight against Clinton. The Battle Royale. A president will occasionally nominate someone so divisive that the opposition decides to stake its reputation on blocking him. This hasn't happened since the twin debacles of the Robert Bork hearings in 1987 and the confrontational Clarence Thomas hearings in 1991. But liberal groups are urging Obama to nominate a true liberal to counter the court's rightward trend. Harold Koh, the State Department lawyer who was confirmed last summer after a long delay, would flare conservative nostrils with his stance on gay rights, while Chicago law professor and current regulatory czar Cass Sunstein has taken numerous out-there stances in his academic work. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano would get shredded for her comment that ""the system worked"" in the wake of the underwear bomber case. Meanwhile, the politics of great legal minds like Bryan A. Stevenson or Elizabeth Warren are probably too progressive to avoid all-out war. The Wild Card. Some candidates are so unconventional that it's impossible to say how their nominations would play--which could be a strategy in and of itself. Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm  would be criticized for her role in the bailouts, but she has a governing background that no other justice does. Interior Secretary and former Colorado Attorney General and Sen. Ken Salazar would have many allies in the Senate, but who knows what people think of him as a legal mind. What about Eric Holder? Or Bill Clinton? Or Cory Booker?

22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/04/death_from_above.html	"Whether this video is evidence of a war crime committed by U.S. troops in Iraq or not, one argument seems beyond dispute: ""It seems like they are playing video games with people's lives,""said Julian Assange, whose site WikiLeaks released the footage taken from a U.S. Apache helicopter as it sprayed gunfire on a group of men, including two Reuters employees, in Baghdad in 2007. It was my first thought, too. The video, shot in black and white from a helicopter circling above a Baghdad neighborhood, will be familiar to anyone who has played the game Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare or its sequel, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. The first game features a level called ""Death From Above,"" in which the player assumes the role of a gunner on an AC-130 gunship as it circles a small village. Winning means shooting at tiny silhouettes as they flee from a church. The sequel allows the player to circle a compound in an AH-64 Apache helicopter--much like in the WikiLeaks video--and mow down enemies for 100 points each. Blaming video games for real-world violence is old hat. Yes, research has linked video games to increased levels of aggression in children, but none has definitely proved that they cause it. To be fair, Assange's point is more subtle than that. He's not saying American gunners mistakenly shoot innocent men because they grew up playing video games. He's suggesting they do so because the killing itself feels like a game. But even this is too simplistic. Modern warfare is becoming more like a video game, most obviously by increasing the distance between soldiers and their targets. But at the same time, warfare video games are becoming more realistic--and not just in the blood-and-guts way. Many of them force players to follow the rules of engagement and make difficult judgment calls about when to shoot--and when not to. (Whether the troops in the video violated the rules of engagement is still unclear.) Some games are even designed to prevent incidents like the 2007 tragedy from happening. The best-known game to deal with real-world battlefield scenarios is America's Army, a popular multiplayer first-person shooter introduced by the U.S. Army in 2002 and the gold standard in ""militainment."" The game started as a recruitment tool, but the Army has since used it in group training as well. (It's also available to the public for download.) The goal isn't to destroy the enemy. It's to work together to complete a mission, such as securing an IED cache. More important than your kill count is a statistic the game calls ""Honor."" Players build up honor by accumulating experience, skill, and, above all, by following the rules of engagement, or ROE. Shoot a civilian, and your honor goes down. Same if you shoot a fellow player. (You also wake up behind bars in Fort Leavenworth.) You can also hurt your honor by damaging local infrastructure or using disproportionate force against the enemy. Helping an injured friend, meanwhile, boosts your honor. The game has even updated its rules since 2002 to fit the latest ROE. If that sounds simplistic, other games simulate dilemmas soldiers are likely to face. Gator Six is a video collection of 260 different military scenarios, such as deciding whether to leave a broken-down ammo truck by the side of the road and dealing with your local interpreter. The game Full Spectrum Warrior, in which the player leads a squad through the fictional war-torn nation of Zekistan, is as much about leadership and problem-solving as killing. A smoke grenade can be more useful than a bullet. The leader doesn't even carry a gun. In a recent article in Foreign Policy, P.W. Singer describes a new kind of game designed to help soldiers preview upcoming missions in Iraq: ""Kids come out and warn of a mine, and then the player has to figure out whether to believe them. A woman screams that the Americans killed her husband, and he has to decide how to respond."" Then there's a whole set of games that have nothing to do with shooting. Army 360 exposes players to cultural situations, like talking to local Afghans or distinguishing between hostile gunfire and a wedding ceremony. Saving Sergeant Pabletti teaches soldiers about sexual harassment. Virtual Iraq helps veterans cope with post-traumatic stress disorder. UrbanSim teaches troops how to navigate the more humdrum aspects of counterinsurgency, such as meeting with tribal elders and creating economic opportunity. Some commercial games have taken cues from their more ethically sensitive counterparts. While Call of Duty doesn't aim for realism, players are punished for friendly fire or shooting civilians. (Then again, there's a level in Modern Warfare 2 in which you're supposed to kill civilians.) In the gunship level described earlier, you're ordered not to fire on the church--only on the baddies streaming out of it. These are minor aspects of the game. And rightly so: If a game wants to be considered ""fun,"" it probably doesn't want to confront players with moral questions at every step. Too much realism and your game will look like this. But nods to the rules of engagement do help avoid charges that war games are nothing but bloodthirsty shoot-'em-ups. While improvements in technology make video-game violence ever more realistic--and desensitizing--they also make the games more complex, and therefore more useful as tools for training soldiers. They'll never be perfect, of course: The most difficult ethical dilemmas are too complex to render in 3-D, and the speed and confusion of war is impossible to reproduce on screen. But the best games can help soldiers anticipate real-world conditions. Video games are hardly to blame for the 2007 tragedy in Baghdad. But they could help to prevent the next one.

23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/03/republican_whips.html	"Say what you will about the RNC. Let he who has never visited a high-end West Hollywood lesbian bondage-themed nightclub cast the first stone. OK, so that's probably a lot of you. But the latest scandal to dog the Republican National Committee--a $1,946 tab at the Los Angeles club Voyeur in February, first reported Monday by the Daily Caller--is tame by Washington standards and far from the electoral fodder some Democrats are making it out to be. Even under the worst-case scenario for Republicans, all they lose is a party chairman widely viewed as a failure. That said, the details make for juicy copy. A young Republican donor group called the Young Eagles organized a fundraiser at the Beverly Hills Hilton on Jan. 31. After the event, a group that included RNC staffers decamped to Voyeur. When the credit card of Young Eagles director Allison Meyers was declined, a California donor named Erik Brown offered his and later asked to be reimbursed by the RNC. The Daily Caller spotted the reimbursement in the committee's monthly FEC report. Meyers was fired from the RNC on Monday. Voyeur was described in a recent Los Angeles Times write-up as ""reminiscent of the masked orgy scene"" in  Eyes Wide Shut, complete with ""impromptu bondage and S&M 'scenes' being played out on an elevated platform by scantily clad performers throughout the night."" A reviewer for the Web site Yelp described watching ""two girls simulating oral sex in a glass case."" The scandal also plays into the narrative that RNC Chairman Michael Steele has no idea what he's doing. Steele has faded into the background in recent months after a series of embarrassing statements, including using the phrases ""honest Injun"" and ""flipping the bird."" In an interview with GQ, he said abortion was an ""individual choice."" And his promise to give the GOP an ""off the hook,"" ""hip-hop"" makeover--not to mention a series of photos of Steele following through on that promise--has been widely mocked. That said, the bondage flap doesn't have the makings of a lasting scandal--so far, at least. For one thing, it appears that Steele didn't attend the event and didn't know about the reimbursement. Others might have known: The Daily Caller reported Tuesday that two top RNC officials may have had to approve the reimbursements for the nightclub, in which case consent would run far up the chain of command. And Steele is, of course, responsible for what happens under his watch. But he's far enough from the center of the storm that he can plausibly plead ignorance. Second, the ""sex club"" angle is overstated. Voyeur appears to be less of a strip club (let alone sex club) than a risque celebrity hangout. The dancers are ""scantily clad"" but there's no nudity. Granted, it's not the ideal choice for an RNC after-party (or a DNC after-party, for that matter). But it's hard to imagine anyone between 21 and 45--the age range of the Young Eagles--being deeply offended by the spectacles on display. Finally, the response to the scandal has been little more than partisan hay-making. The Democratic National Committee has blasted out dozens of delighted e-mails calling attention to the story. But it's hard to find anyone--save a few Republican donors--who are genuinely upset about it. Even Tea Party leaders who love to complain about spendthrift Republicans don't feel especially energized: ""A week from now, this will be forgotten,"" says Judson Phillips, who organized the Nashville Tea Party Convention in February. ""I think we're more concerned with larger issues,"" says Lu Busse, a conservative Colorado activist who has been critical of Republicans. The consequences for the RNC and for Steele are likely to be limited. Steele's performance as chairman has long irked the GOP establishment. But Steele has made it clear he's not resigning, and it would take a two-thirds vote by RNC members to oust him. Easier to just challenge him when his term is up in January--something GOP stalwarts were probably planning to do already. A good point of reference is the scandal that brought down Republican U.S. senatorial candidate Jack Ryan in 2004. Unlike the RNC scandal, that one actually involved a sex club. Unlike Steele, Ryan actually went to the club. Unlike the RNC staffers who partied at Voyeur, Ryan actually engaged in skeevy behavior while there. (His wife said he encouraged her to perform sex acts.) And, unlike anyone so far involved in the current scandal, Ryan was actually running for office. Consider, too, all the bona fide sex scandals that have failed to get officials removed from office. A 1990 GQ profile of Sen. Edward Kennedy described him sexually assaulting a waitress and having sex with a congressional lobbyist on the floor of a private room at a D.C. restaurant. David Vitter remains a U.S. senator after his number showed up on the phone list of the ""D.C. Madam."" Sen. Larry Craig served out his term after getting caught soliciting sex in a Minneapolis airport bathroom. The only way bondage-gate becomes a real scandal is if it turns out the RNC tried to cover up details. So far, it's fired the staffer responsible and promised donors it won't happen again. But a drip-drip of new information would turn the story from ""RNC pays embarrassing nightclub tab"" to ""RNC lies about it."" The latter is much worse. So short of video evidence that Steele himself was gyrating in a glass case, this scandal has no legs. Become a fan of  Slate on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/03/obama_gives_up.html	"President Obama's allies have occasionally been irritated that he won't do away with all his bipartisan talk and treat his opponents as they deserve to be treated. These allies/critics must be happy with his speech today in Iowa City, the same place he unveiled his health care proposal in December 2007 and where today he mocked his opponents with the thoroughgoing enjoyment he displayed during the campaign. ""Leaders of the Republican Party, they called the passage of this bill 'Armageddon.' "" Obama told the audience, to laughter. "" 'End of freedom as we know it.' So after I signed the bill, I looked around to see if there [were] any asteroids falling or some cracks opening up in the Earth. It turned out it was a nice day. Birds were chirping. Folks were strolling down the Mall. People still have their doctors."" I half expected Obama to pull out a version of the campaign line he used to flash when he was feeling particularly loose. ""Don't be hoodwinked,"" he used to say of McCain's or Hillary Clinton's claims. ""Don't be bamboozled, don't fall for the okey-doke."" Since taking office, Obama has dashed between two postures. When he has made overtly partisan shots, he has pretty quickly returned to his posture as the post-partisan bridge builder. He traveled to Massachusetts in mid-January to beat up on Scott Brown on the eve of the special Senate election, for example, but weeks later, in the State of the Union, he said he would ""not give up on changing the tone of our politics."" Now, in the last week leading up to the health care vote and in the days since the bill's passage, Obama has stopped bothering with the bipartisanship. He's been forceful, relaxed, and just the kind of fellow Democrats hope can save their fortunes in November. Conservatives might find this celebration after health care passage unseemly. They might think it's unbecoming of a president of all the people. But Ronald Reagan was even better than Obama at tweaking his opponents like this. This is a fine presidential tradition--even down to the detail of daring your opponents to run on repealing your reforms, as Obama did Thursday and Reagan did in 1982 (though, of course, Reagan didn't make such a big deal about ending partisanship). Still, the president is smart enough to know that making fun of your opponents by treating them like imbeciles will energize them. There's nothing like an end-zone dance to fire up the other team. But either he's having too much fun or he knows that his side needs to celebrate a little. And he probably also realizes that, given the state of bipartisanship these days, there's not much to lose. More evidence of the president's decision to drop the bipartisan pretense comes from two speeches he gave about health care reform--one in September to a joint session of Congress and one last weekend to House Democrats. In September, appealing to lawmakers' sense of compassion, Obama said:"	Obama Gives Up: The era of bipartisanship is over, at least until November.

Neugebauer, and may have a different view than the White House about the executive order the president will sign tomorrow relating to abortion and the new health care bill. I interviewed Stupak for CBS's program  Washington Unplugged. He praised the health care bill and the compromise that ultimately secured his vote. ""Some people say this piece of paper isn't worth it, but I would remind them that in 2007, when George W. Bush signed the executive order to prevent stem-cell research, these groups that are criticizing it, they applauded it, they welcomed it; and now President Obama's going to sign an executive order once again protecting life and somehow it's not worth the paper it's written on. You can't have it both ways."" Stupak said the last several months of intense pressure from interest groups, fellow lawmakers, and the media have not been fun, and he sounded thoroughly disillusioned with the anti-abortion groups that went from being his allies to his new enemies: ""I really have to wonder, these groups who now say this wasn't good enough. Were they really interested in protecting life or were they just trying to politicize the life issue to defeat health care? I'm really disappointed in some of these groups that I've worked with for a long time."" When I asked Stupak about the scope of the executive order the president will sign Wednesday, related to abortion, he seemed to have a different understanding about its reach than the administration. The executive order and the underlying legislation base the abortion restrictions on the Hyde Amendment, which denies the use of certain federal funds for abortions. The amendment must be reauthorized each year--and has been for the last 36 years. It's unlikely it will not be renewed each year. But according to the administration sources to whom I talked, if it does not get renewed, the provisions on abortion in the health care legislation no longer hold. Stupak offered what appeared to be a different reading when I spoke to him:"	Rep. Bart Stupak, at the heart of health care and abortion.
26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/03/get_well_soon.html	"Fourteen months have passed since President Obama signed the $787 billion stimulus package, and economists still can't agree to what extent it helped the economy recover. Same with the Wall Street bailout, signed by President Bush 17 months ago. Even the New Deal, passed more than 70 years ago, is still being debated. Health care reform won't be any different. Yes, there are some direct ways to measure how well reform is achieving its goals five, 10, 20 years from now. But anyone who expects a satisfying answer may be disappointed. What measurements can we look at? First, it's worth enumerating what, exactly, the goals of health care reform were, as articulated by Obama and the Democrats. One was to protect families from financial instability and possible bankruptcy due to medical bills. Obama also argued that reform would make Americans healthier and save lives. Finally, reform was supposed to help rein in the country's spiraling health care costs and keep the nation from sinking deeper into debt--although you could argue that this was really more of a selling point than an original goal of reform. The first goal--simply increasing enrollment--will be almost impossible not to achieve, and we'll know it when we see it. Enrollment numbers in private insurance and Medicaid should go up, since subsidies will make plans more affordable and Americans who don't sign up for insurance will have to pay a fine. Meanwhile, more Americans will probably report that they have a source of care other than an emergency room. If these numbers don't rise, there is a problem. (By this measurement, health care reform in Massachusetts has been a rousing success, with 97 percent of residents insured.) Gauging whether reform is bringing down costs is not so straightforward. The amount families spend on medical care, premiums, and the quality of their care are all measured by the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. If health care reform is to be judged a success, those numbers should, on average, go down. That said, more individuals and families will be enrolled, so they may go to the doctor more often. Plus, premiums may go up for some groups, like the young and healthy, even while they go down for the sick. So while the data is there, it may not be crystal-clear. Even harder to measure is the number of Americans who go bankrupt because of medical bills. The most commonly cited study, conducted by researchers from Harvard University and Ohio University, estimates that medical problems contributed to at least 46 percent of all bankruptcies in 2001 and to 62 percent of bankruptcies in 2007--a nearly 50 percent increase over six years. But conservatives have criticized its methodology and sample size. Liberal health care economist Uwe Reinhardt of Princeton University says the data on medical bankruptcies is vague. The solution, he says, is to conduct a major survey now measuring the stress of medical bills on American families and compare that data to new numbers after 2014, when the individual mandate kicks in. If the number of bankruptcies goes down, Obama can claim a victory. And good luck measuring health care reform's effect on the economy. The Congressional Budget Office projects that reform will reduce the deficit by $143 billion over the first 10 years and $1.3 trillion in the second decade. But the CBO emphasizes its uncertainty. Moreover, we may know 20 years from now how much we spend on health care. But it will be difficult to say for sure whether we would have spent more or less had reform never passed. The problem with these numbers, as with any real-world economic measurement, is that there's no control. Medical bankruptcies may eventually go down, but they might have gone down anyway, thanks to a rebounding economy. Americans might get healthier, but education and anti-obesity efforts might have made them healthier anyway. Despite the Obama administration's penchant for citing ""jobs created or saved,"" no such measurement exists. The control problem is even more egregious when it comes to gauging whether health care reform will have made Americans healthier. As Megan McArdle argues over at the Atlantic, if liberals claim that health care reform will save tens of thousands of lives every year, then we should see the mortality rate decline by that much. Fair enough. But the notion that health care economists can look at the mortality rate 10 years from now and ascribe a certain number of lives saved to health care reform--as opposed to advancements in science, economic improvement, or the weather--is dubious. Even at this late date, economists are still trying to figure out whether Medicare saves lives. Plus, there will always be economists, such as the Cato Institute's Michael Cannon, who argue that we could save more lives per dollar with smaller, targeted programs--like treating hypertension in low-income neighborhoods--than by requiring everyone to buy insurance. Health care reform may be a decisive political victory for Democrats. It could even become as popular as Medicare, which soared in the polls once implemented, despite the fear-mongering that surrounded it. But that's different from saying it will be a quantifiable policy success. ""We won't lack data,"" says Karen Davenport of the Center for American Progress. ""But we might have some disagreements.""

27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/03/vintage_bill_clinton.html	"The relationship between President Obama and former President Bill Clinton gained some amusing new contours last night. Clinton stood in for Obama at the Gridiron Club's annual dinner. He was in his best form, folksy, earnest and making a good amount of fun of himself--his vanity, his advanced age, and his legacy. Perhaps his best line came when he outlined the prospects for health care reform. ""It may not happen in my lifetime, or Dick Cheney's, but hopefully by Easter,"" he said referring to their respective heart troubles. The evening marked the 125th anniversary of the organization of Washington journalists, of which I am a member, in which the men wear white tie and tails and club members perform skits poking fun at the sitting president and other politicians. Clinton joked that the evening was taking place on the anniversary of Douglas MacArthur's ""I shall return"" speech. The theme of the jokes from both the current and former presidents was Clinton's desire to get back into the presidency. ""I've been wanting to stand in for President Obama for a long time,"" Clinton pretended to confide. Obama spoke to the dinner via videotape, appearing on an enormous video screen that was wheeled into the ballroom at the last minute. He said when he called Clinton to stand in for him, the former president said, ""Let me clear my schedule for the next three years."" The good-natured repartee was a sign that the hatchet had been buried since the bruising primaries, but it was also a reminder of how tense it got at times. Remember that Obama called out Clinton for ""triangulation and poll-driven politics"" that built power for Clinton but not his party, a point Obama elaborated on in one debate. This is what led Obama to famously pick Reagan over Clinton when talking about leaders who had genuinely transformed the country. Obama's relationship with Hillary Clinton seems to be thriving, but you can imagine that the relationship between the 42nd and 44th president is full of rich and complex material. Clinton joked that Obama was too busy to attend because he was ""polishing his Nobel Peace Prize."" Clinton said Obama asked: ""You've got one of these yet?"" When Clinton said no, he said Obama went on to remind him that Al Gore and Jimmy Carter had them. (Gore, Clinton said, wears his Peace Prize around his neck). The Nobel humor played on the widely reported stories reporting that Clinton was irritated Obama won the award before he did. That wasn't the only sore spot Clinton touched. Clinton joked that the club members shouldn't be worried about Obama missing the dinner last year and this year because Jesse Jackson missed them in 1984 and 1988. It was a reference to a similar remark Clinton made about the insignificance of Obama's victory in the South Carolina Democratic primary. Several Democratic leaders and pundits said Clinton used the analogy to highlight Obama's race. (When the audience laughed, Clinton said he hoped they were laughing at themselves--he has widely railed against the press's interpretation of his remarks). Some other Clinton zingers: noting that he speaking on the first night of spring, ""otherwise known to Al Gore as proof of global warming."" Speaking of the sitting vice president, who also did not attend the dinner, he said, ""Vice President Biden, God bless his mouth."" Speaking of Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, whose combative and profane ways have been the subject of so much scrutiny lately, the former president said, ""I found Rahm. I created him. I made him what he is today. I am so sorry."" It is customary for the sitting president to attend, but Obama was scheduled to be in the Far East. When he delayed the trip, he didn't insist on attending the dinner. Not that he was dying to, but politically it wouldn't have looked great with the health care legislation still unresolved. Obama would be criticized either for looking overconfident or, if the bill ultimately failed, for looking unserious. To show his serious side, former President Clinton ended his remarks by talking about the earthquake in Haiti. He asked journalists not to forget the tragedy there and to hold relief organizations accountable. He also praised Obama for his efforts on health care reform. To demonstrate just how difficult the task was, Clinton quoted a long passage from Machiavelli's The Prince. ""There is nothing more difficult to carry out, nor more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to handle, than to initiate a new order of things. For the reformer has enemies in all those who profit by the old order, and only lukewarm defenders in all those who would profit by the new order."" Clinton arrived nearly an hour late to the dinner, maintaining a reputation for lateness that has followed him after his presidency. He ended the evening in Clinton fashion, too--chatting and taking pictures with the waiters who cleared the tables after the famous people had left the room.

28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2010/03/romancing_the_cbo.html	"The Congressional Budget Office released its assessment of the House fixes to the Senate health care reform bill Thursday. Over the next 10 years, the package would cost $940 billion and reduce the federal deficit by $130 billion. Over the second decade, it would reduce the deficit by $1.2 trillion. Asterisk. It's not that those numbers are wrong. It's that they rely on assumptions that don't always square with reality. Any time the CBO scores a piece of legislation, it measures the bill's cost based on current law--in other words, it assumes that the status quo is going to hold, even if everyone knows it won't. Members of Congress can therefore tweak a bill to make it look more favorable in the short-term than it really is in the long run. Here are some of the most common tricks to make your bill look good and how the health care bill does or doesn't use them: Tax now, pay later. You might call this the oldest trick in the book. It dates back at least to 1935, when Congress passed Social Security. In 1937, the tax kicked in, but benefits didn't get paid out until 1940, thus guaranteeing that the program would be solvent. Of course, the delay made sense policywise, since Social Security needed a pot of money before it could start paying out benefits. But since then, Congress has used the strategy of speeding up revenue and delaying costs to make all kinds of legislation look more affordable than it really is. Some say that because most of the health-insurance reforms wouldn't kick in until 2014--nearly four years after the first taxes begin--it's not sustainable. According to the CBO report, however, long-term sustainability isn't a problem. Delay the pain. One of the best policy ideas in the health care bill, according to most economists, is the tax on so-called ""Cadillac"" health care plans. It's also one of the most controversial, particularly among unions. Perhaps that's why the tax doesn't kick in until 2018, when Barack Obama is no longer president and the 111th Congress is a distant memory. The problem is, there's no guarantee it will ever kick in. Congress could simply overturn it in 2018. And opponents now have eight years to rally against it. One of the best revenue streams for health care reform is thus not only delayed but also uncertain. ""To some it does seem, if not ludicrous, very iffy,"" says Isabel Sawhill of the Brookings Institution. Count on fixes. In 1997, Congress planned to lower the amount of money doctors are paid by Medicare as part of the Balanced Budget Act. Instead, they've passed an annual ""doc fix"" to make sure that doctors' reimbursements don't go down. Some Democrats want to make that fix permanent. But until that happens, the CBO is forced to assume that current law--i.e., lower reimbursement rates--will continue and therefore assumes the country is saving more money than it really is. The Alternative Minimum Tax is similar: Originally, the tax was intended to expand every year to include more families, thus bringing in more revenue. But Congress instead passes an annual ""patch"" to protect those families, thereby blocking the revenue stream. Pretend that costs will ""sunset."" The Bush tax cuts passed in 2001 were originally intended to ""sunset"" in 2010, at which point tax rates would revert to previous levels. But now that it's 2010, no one wants to be accused of raising taxes. Obama has therefore promised to extend the cuts for everyone except families making more than $250,000. Yet budget projections have always assumed that the tax cuts would end after 2010, making future deficits seem less egregious. The health care legislation contains few if any truly misleading accounting gimmicks. Everything is above-board--at least for those who care to look. And because Obama asked for a 20-year projection rather than the usual 10-year window, critics have a harder time claiming the bill would only work for a decade. But the bill has still been tweaked to maximize its CBO score. The question now is whether reality will cooperate.Become a fan of  Slate on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."
