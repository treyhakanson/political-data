It's usually taken for granted that major-party candidates will agree to the Commission on Presidential Debates' schedule, but there's no law requiring it, and Trump has never seen a political norm he hasn't considered razing and building something gaudy over. And over the past couple of weeks, he's laid the groundwork for not participating in the debates by suggesting that they are, in some nebulous way, a trap he can't agree to until he's carefully combed through the conditions. Don't be fooled. He's going to do them. Well, at least he'll do one of them, and see how much he likes it. What he first needs is some face-saving adjustment to the schedule, the debate rules, the debate hall, or whatever. It doesn't matter what it is, and it doesn't even have to be an alteration that's tactically advantageous. The whole point of his debate moaning is just to act as another dominance play to demonstrate his ability to wield leverage in negotiating a deal. Trump feels that various facets of the primary and general election are ""rigged,"" or at least he finds political profit in saying so. And so he has--or had, for at least one news cycle--arrived at the lamentable conclusion that this autumn's scheduled debate is among the rigged election components. Late last month, he tweeted that ""Hillary & the Dems"" were behind this particular rigging. Maybe the Commission on Presidential Debates would have done better if it had found available autumn nights that weren't Sundays or Mondays, so alluring will be the prospect of watching, for example, the Atlanta Falcons do battle with the New Orleans Saints. But the CPD is a split panel made of both Democrats and Republicans, and it released the schedule last September. There was plenty of time to get gripes in prior to that, and if Hillary & the Dems were trying to rig it now, they'd be a year too late. (In a side-lie, Trump claimed that he ""got a letter from the N.F.L. saying, 'This is ridiculous.' "" The N.F.L. sent no letter to Donald Trump.) The Clinton campaign has been attempting to goad Trump into making a definitive commitment to the debates as-is. In a statement on Monday saying Clinton would accept the commission's invitation, campaign chair John Podesta noted how it's ""concerning that the Trump campaign is already engaged in shenanigans around these debates. It is not clear if he is trying to avoid debates, or merely toying with the press to create more drama."" Podesta added that ""the only issue now is whether Donald Trump is going to show up to the debate at the date, times, places and formats set by the commission last year through a bipartisan process."" Trump told Time on Tuesday that he would ""absolutely do three debates"" and that he ""wants to debate very badly."" But first, he said, ""I have to see the conditions."" It's an amateur move from the supposed greatest negotiator in history to first say, on the record, ""I will absolutely do three debates,"" before saying that he needs to see the conditions before agreeing to anything. If he were to skip now--and he will go back and forth about what he's thinking publicly several times before this is over--he would look like he's broken a commitment. Not that anyone, even his supporters, expects his word to carry much weight. Either way, these ""shenanigans"" should be moot by the first scheduled debate on Sept. 26. Unless Trump pulls off some extraordinary reversal in the polls over the next 47 days, he will need to participate in that debate, because he will be losing the presidential race. When he skipped the final primary debate before the Iowa caucuses earlier this year, he chalked it up to a sarcastic press release Fox News had issued. More realistically, though, he was looking at the slim polling lead he was carrying into Iowa and was trying to run out the clock. (As it turned out, the polls in Iowa were off, and the superior, organized Cruz campaign took the state.) All he wants now is some concession from the CPD so he can say he won a concession from the CPD. He alludes to this in his Time interview. ""I renegotiated the debates in the primaries, remember?"" he recalled fondly. ""They were making a fortune on them and they had us in for three and a half hours and I said that's ridiculous."" It was three hours moved down to two, and it's not clear that Trump was the motivating force behind the change--or just CNBC recognizing that this length was ridiculous. But this is the sort of marginal logistical item he may try to barter over, for the sole purpose of saying that he was able to negotiate a better deal. And if he can't negotiate one of his masterful deals, he has a ready-made excuse for a poor performance when he participates anyway: It was rigged all along, just like the whole election is.

In the case of one very famous Republican, however, the outreach has been going on for much longer. For years, Clinton has spoken warmly and admiringly of Henry Kissinger, a man whose record around the world displayed a special disregard for human rights, the rule of law, and basic decency. On Monday, an article in Politico detailed the Clinton campaign's attempt to woo GOP foreign policy ""elders,"" including Condoleezza Rice, James Baker, and Kissinger. Later in the day, the New York Times reported that 50 Republican former national security officials had signed a letter essentially saying Donald Trump was unfit to be commander-in-chief. Kissinger, Baker, Colin Powell, and others were not on this list, sparking speculation about whether an even higher profile repudiation of Trump is in the offing. There's nothing wrong with the Clinton campaign making its case to Republicans wary of their party's nominee; the continued defections from the party establishment are a damning blow for Trump. When it comes to Kissinger, however, Clinton should know better. Yet rather than distance herself, Clinton has wooed him with unrestrained enthusiasm. She has often spoken of his wisdom and the value of his ""insight"" and ""expertise."" She reviewed one in the seemingly endless supply of his books with fulsome words of praise. (A taste: ""Kissinger is a friend, and I relied on his counsel when I served as secretary of state. He checked in with me regularly, sharing astute observations about foreign leaders and sending me written reports on his travels."") She defended him in a debate with Bernie Sanders during which the latter attacked Kissinger's record on foreign policy. She has even chosen to spend holidays with him. Team Clinton likes to talk of a special bond among the men and women who have held the position of secretary of state. But Kissinger's record as secretary of state makes any association with him morally suspect. Donald Trump may pose a unique threat to American democracy, but he hardly has a monopoly on contempt for democratic norms. And few American officeholders have been as cavalier about violating those principles as Kissinger. The Nixon administration's illegal bombing of Cambodia stands as one of the most callous decisions any American administration has made. It led to the predictable destabilization of that country and later, to genocide. A disregard for democracy and preference for military rule were hallmarks of the Nixon-Kissinger foreign policy, whether in Chile (where Kissinger showed a decided preference for Augusto Pinochet's dictatorial rule) or Greece (where a military junta was also seen as preferable to democracy). In the case of South Asia, Nixon and Kissinger (then national security adviser) kept up their staunch support for a Pakistani military dictatorship responsible for the slaughter of tens (if not hundreds) of thousands in what is now Bangladesh. (It's often hard to uncover exactly how many people were killed because of Nixon-Kissinger policies.) Donald Trump's compliments to Vladimir Putin are nothing compared to the respect Kissinger showed to one strongman after another, from Argentina to Iran to Zaire. And let's not forget Kissinger's role in the 1968 election. By leaking information he learned about peace negotiations, Kissinger, then an academic, abetted Nixon's scheme to inform the South Vietnamese that they would get a better deal from his administration, should he come into power. Upon hearing this news, the South Vietnamese government refused to send negotiators to peace talks in Paris, despite the Johnson administration's suspension of bombing raids. The result was embarrassing to the Johnson administration, whose vice president, Hubert Humphrey, went on to lose a close election to Nixon several days later. (Naturally, with Nixon and Kissinger in power, the war went on for several more pointless and bloody years.) Kissinger's post-governmental career has hardly been more respectable. Over the years, he has spoken approvingly of repressive regimes around the globe. Of the Tiananmen Square massacre, Kissinger commented:"	Hillary Clinton's Troubling Soft Spot for Henry Kissinger	['Sanders', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'Nixon']	[]

It doesn't matter that so many state ballot deadlines have already passed. The only one that really matters for him comes on Aug. 15, when he needs to turn in 1,000 signatures to be listed as an independent presidential candidate on Utah's ballot. Look at the resume: a decade in the CIA, MBA from Wharton, Goldman Sachs gig, policy work on the Hill. Now that we've listed the unimportant parts, let's get to the meat of the matter. McMullin was born in Provo, Utah. He is a Mormon and holds an undergraduate degree from Brigham Young. McMullin knows what's up here, and he ""plans to aggressively contest"" Utah, according to BuzzFeed's story breaking the news of his candidacy. McMullin's first campaign logo depicts the letter ""M"" with one star over it. It's an apt symbol for a candidate whose success will be measured by his ability to win one state. The ""Utah strategy"" is one that Never Trump Republicans have been toying with since well before McMullin came into the picture. It was one justification for the seemingly endless efforts to recruit Mitt Romney into the race, and it's a state in which Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson is working hard as well (often in spite of himself.) McMullin's ties to Utah make him a much more competitive fit for the state than, say, Tennessee's David French would have been; if he has enough money behind him, it's not out of the question that he might jump into contention in the state. This is where the Utah strategy's underpants-gnome problem asserts itself, though: How does a strong Utah performance, or even an outright Utah win, help Never Trumpers arrive at a January 2017 inauguration that swears in neither Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump? Let's take Trump's clearest (still longshot) path to the presidency: holding Mitt Romney's 2012 map and flipping Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. That gives Trump 273 electoral votes to Clinton's 265--if Utah holds for Trump. In this scenario, McMullin can play two roles, assuming his Utah efforts are serious. The first is to swing the election to Hillary Clinton. We don't know how many people supporting Clinton might switch to McMullin, but chances are that in a state as red as Utah, most persuadable voters would be anti-Trump conservatives or reluctant, hold-your-nose Trump supporters. The effect, then, would be to split the state's natural Republican majority and throw the state to Clinton by plurality, giving her 271 electoral votes and the presidency. The second possibility for McMullin would be an outright win of the state. This is more of a test because ... it's really hard for independent or third-party presidential candidates to win states! None has done it since George Wallace took the Deep South in 1968, and he didn't take enough states to alter the outcome of the election. But just for kicks, and because 2016 is weird, let's say McMullin is able to take a roughly 40 percent plurality in Utah and pull off the victory, leaving Trump with 267 electoral votes to Clinton's 265. That would probably end in a Donald Trump presidency. Utah-strategy proponents think that if they can get the election to the House of Representatives, they might be able to twist enough arms to throw the election to the independent candidate. Never Trumpers think that any shot to deny Trump the presidency is better than no shot at all. Reasonable enough. But still no shot at all. Imagine you are a Republican member of Congress and Donald Trump has just won 267 electoral votes, two more than Hillary Clinton. He would have won 273 electoral votes, but for this 40-year-old ex-spook from Utah. How are you going to tell your Republican constituents, many of whom quite fancy Trump, that you cast your lot with anyone but Trump in the House of Representatives? Even though the votes would be counted by state, with each state getting one vote, it would take about five seconds of intrepid reporting to determine whom each individual member supported. The same base-driven pressures that prevented the RNC or Republican delegates from blocking Trump's nomination at the convention, or that are forcing people like John McCain, Kelly Ayotte, and Paul Ryan to back Trump's candidacy at arm's length, are the same that would carry Trump through the House of Representatives. That's especially the case if the third option is a young, unknown figure like McMullin, and not a Mitt Romney. It's unlikely that McMullin gets to play this role anyway. If Trump has carried Ohio, Florida, and Pennsylvania in the first place, he's probably done well enough nationally to win his plurality in Utah--and also to carry some combination of Iowa, Nevada, and New Hampshire to render Utah's six electoral votes moot. But if there's going to be a role, it doesn't end in Evan McMullin being sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. It ends in either gifting Hillary Clinton the presidency or in Republican House members personally signing off on Trump's win. Like a lot of Never Trump conservative activity, the Utah strategy gets too cutesy with the fine print and dismisses the mass political pressures most of the party is facing.

3	3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/how_trump_s_toughness_makes_him_a_sucker_for_putin.html	"Donald Trump talks tough. ""We're going to win on trade,"" he told a crowd in Windham, New Hampshire, on Saturday night. ""We're going to win with the military. We're going to kick the ass of ISIS."" But Trump has a soft spot. He speaks reverently of Russia's strongman president, Vladimir Putin. He defends Putin's seizure of Crimea, a Ukrainian territory. He refuses to criticize Russia's alleged role in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee. Last month, Trump's representatives apparently softened Republican platform language that would have called for military assistance to Ukraine. Why does Trump suck up to Russia? In part, it's because Putin flatters Trump, and Trump is openly smitten by the flattery. In part, it's because Trump has pro-Russian advisers. Trump might also be influenced by his financial ties to Russia, which Slate's Franklin Foer has documented. But those explanations still leave a puzzle: How does a man who preaches vigilance and ""American First"" become another country's tool? What makes Trump kick one ass but kiss another? The answer lies in a peculiar mix of ideas and dispositions: Trump's nationalism, his authoritarianism, his disregard for the laws of war, and his belief that foreign policy can be conducted like a business. But the factor that unites them all is the complexity of international relations. You're never dealing with just one country. If you aim your vigilance in one direction, you can be fleeced or used from the other direction. That's what has happened to Trump. In case after case, he has vowed to stand up to leaders, countries, and nonstate actors that happen, by coincidence or design, to be Russia's adversaries. In his speeches, Trump describes a litany of enemies: Iranian mullahs, Syrian refugees, Mexican rapists, Chinese trade negotiators. None of these putative threats is fundamentally allied with Russia. And Trump isn't wrong that in the struggle against Islamic jihadism, Russia's interests often overlap with ours. At rallies in recent days, Trump has recited a list of terrorists and terror suspects from Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan, countries that have given Russia fits. Trump is quite open in his overtures to Putin. ""Wouldn't it be nice if we actually did get along with Russia?"" Trump asked an audience in North Carolina on July 25. ""Wouldn't it be nice if Russia and us and a couple of others went out and knocked the hell out of ISIS?"" Fighting ISIS was too expensive for Russia or for us alone, Trump argued. Why not split the cost? It's ""no different than a business,"" he said. President Obama doesn't see war this way. Obama's problem, in Trump's view, is that he won't stand for the way Russia and its Syrian proxies fight, because they endanger and kill civilians. Trump has no such compunctions. He's for torture, targeting the families of terrorists, and loosening the rules of engagement. He also says we should seize Iraq's oil because ""to the victor belong the spoils."" Trump's military ethics are no different from Putin's. Teaming up with Russia makes sense. The same business logic explains Trump's withdrawal of America's commitment to defend Europe. Traditionally, American presidents have treated Russia as a threat because of its aggression around the world, but particularly in Europe. Putin's seizure of Crimea in 2014 and his ongoing proxy war in Ukraine provide fresh evidence of this threat. But Trump doesn't choose to confront Russia. He chooses to confront the countries Russia might invade, by insisting that they pay us more to protect them. At several recent campaign rallies, Trump has delivered a clear message: If NATO members don't meet his financial demands, the United States, on his watch, would not defend those countries in the event of a Russian invasion, regardless of treaty commitments. ""I want the countries that we're protecting to pay up,"" Trump told a crowd in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Aug. 1. ""And if they don't, I'm sorry, folks."" Two days later, speaking in Jacksonville, Florida, Trump noted that reporters had asked him, ""What happens if one of these countries ... gets attacked by Russia? Are you saying you're not going to protect them?"" His response, he proudly told the audience, was: ""Well, let me ask you: Have they paid?"" For Trump, it's all about money. Many of the countries we defend, he points out, are wealthy. His list starts with Germany, Japan, South Korea, and Saudi Arabia. ""If Japan is attacked, we have to go in there with our full force and might,"" he complained in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on Friday. If the Japanese don't pony up, he warned, they might have to ""take over this monster [North Korea] and figure it out. We're very far away. It's very expensive."" Many of the countries we defend don't have Japan's wealth. So Trump offers a different argument for not coming to their aid: They're unimportant. How does Trump measure geostrategic importance? The same way he measures everything else: by ratings. ""We're protecting countries that most of the people in this room have never even heard of,"" he jeered at a rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania, on July 27. ""Give me a break."" NATO's founding purpose is to send a clear message that if any member is attacked, others stand ready to defend it by force. Trump rejects that policy, preferring unpredictability to deterrence. In a Fox News interview with Trump on July 30, Brian Kilmeade pointed out that Russia had invaded two neighboring countries, Georgia and Ukraine, and had buzzed American ships. If Russia were to escalate its military incursions, Kilmeade asked, ""Would you answer with force?"" In his reply, Trump chose not to warn Russia, even vaguely, that it would pay a price. ""I'm not going to tell you,"" he told Kilmeade. ""You've got to keep it a little bit secret."" Trump doesn't just flash a green light to Russia. He directly undermines NATO and advances Russia's ambitions by encouraging Europe to break up. Putin views the dissolution of the Soviet Union as a catastrophe. To even things out, the Russian president has been promoting nationalism in Europe, with the goal of fracturing the European Union and NATO. In this effort, Trump has become Putin's ally, celebrating Britain's exit from the EU and urging other European countries to follow suit. British voters ditched the EU because ""they've had enough,"" Trump told a crowd in Ashburn, Virginia, on Tuesday. Having left, he argued, ""They're better off. And you watch: Other countries in the European Union will follow. ... You watch what happens to Angela Merkel."" Trump went on: ""People now tell me they're going to leave Germany."" In speech after speech, he adds: ""France is no longer France."" Alongside this portrait of Europe in decline, Trump depicts an ascendant Russia. He says Hillary Clinton is a fool to mess with Putin's might. ""She has terrible relationships with Putin,"" Trump told the audience in Virginia. ""This is a nuclear country we're talking about. Russia, strong nuclear country. And so are we, but their stuff is newer. Their stuff is newer ... [and] they have a lot more."" Clinton ""wants to play the role of the tough guy against Putin and Russia,"" Trump scoffed. Instead, he argued, ""She should be tough on trade,"" particularly ""our trade deficits with China."" Trump points out that Russia and China are collaborating on some things, including oil sales and naval exercises. For this, he blames Obama. ""We forced [Russia], through stupidity, into an alliance with China,"" Trump charged in Columbus, Ohio, on Aug. 1. ""We were driving them both crazy. ... Obama forced them together, 'cause he didn't get along with either."" That's what you get when you stand up to Putin, says Trump. Putin holds the cards, and we had better stop giving him trouble. Given a choice between America's president and Russia's, Trump prefers Russia's. ""He's a better leader than Obama,"" Trump says. Even when interviewers point out that Putin, unlike Obama, arranges the murders of his domestic opponents, including journalists, Trump still says Putin is better. That's because Trump, like Putin, believes in ""law and order"" without irksome constitutional constraints. And that's why Trump, in the face of intelligence assessments that Russian agents hacked the Democratic National Committee, celebrates the hack and refuses to criticize Russia for it. Trump says he was joking when he proposed, at a press conference on July 27, ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing."" But that doesn't explain why, when reporters invited Trump to ""call on Putin to stay out of this election,"" Trump shot back: ""I'm not going to tell Putin what to do. Why should I tell Putin what to do?"" Trump said he agreed with Putin that American incompetence, not Russian espionage, was to blame for the hack. The real story, Trump argued, was the content of the leaked emails, not ""Russia or China or whoever it is that's doing the hacking."" This is the final ingredient in Trump's bromance with Putin: For Trump, sucking up to Putin is a way of standing up to Obama and Clinton. The Republican nominee's antipathy toward the Democratic president and the former Democratic secretary of state is so great that when Russia commits espionage against them, Trump sides with Russia. To Trump, this isn't a show of disloyalty or gullibility. It's a show of firmness against America's real enemy: Clinton. On Saturday, speaking in New Hampshire, Trump called her a ""monster"" who would cause ""the destruction of our country from within."" That's how, in the name of a muscular America, you become a Russian tool. You despise America's president. You admire strength and disdain constitutional limits on it. You glorify nationalism at the expense of alliances. You treat foreign policy as a business, choosing partners based on profit, not on shared values. And all the while, as you aim your scrutiny and threats at the enemies of a single foreign power, you tell yourself and the public that you're a hawk. You're not a hawk. You're a pigeon.

Ostensibly about cutting taxes and slashing regulation--the cornerstones of Trump's economic agenda, no matter how many times he is referred to as a populist--the speech mostly served as an attack on Hillary Clinton's economic policies. Its relatively straightforward and un-Trumpian delivery (he didn't even resort to calls for violence during numerous interruptions by protesters) was meant to mark the start of a new phase in the candidate's stumbling campaign. Instead, it merely highlighted the artifice and effort required to make Trump sound like a normal human being for an hour. Painting a picture of economic decline and doom--lost jobs, declining wages, inequality--has been a mainstay of nominees' speeches for decades. But this one was particular Trumpian. He talked about crime and immigration policies hurting opportunity in Detroit; he referenced government money being sent to refugees when it could have been dispatched to hardworking Americans; he spoke darkly of foreign actors seeking to weaken America. And despite the fact that the speech was carefully scripted, several of his flourishes remained. ""Big increase,"" Trump said about Clinton's tax plan. ""One of the biggest ever."" Indeed, the attack on Clinton was the only sustained theme of the speech, something normal for a campaign event but out of place in a talk billed as a major policy address. Trump is simply incapable of offering a positive vision of his own: He can only offer himself up as the negative space of the people he and his supporters hate--mostly Clinton, but also her husband and President Barack Obama. He discussed Clinton's belief in ""radical regulation"" and even brought up her use of the term ""short circuit"" to imply that she is mentally unbalanced. (Psychiatrists have a word for this.) The details of Trump's policy proposals, or at least the ones that were offered, were predictable but not worth examining with a magnifying glass. (He offered specific tax brackets that were different than ones he had previously offered. Asking why is probably futile.) His attack on regulation--and his pledge to put a temporary moratorium on new Cabinet-agency regulations--was no doubt a sign that Trump has been paying attention to his new team of right-wing economic advisers. (When he lightly touched on things like a child care deduction, he did so with no energy and very little detail.) This was a speech, then, that was meant for Republican bigwigs as much as for passionate Trump voters, but mixed in with a typically libertarian agenda were the familiar themes of bad trade deals and seething foreigners. As Trump's advisers have enunciated over the past several days, the goal of Monday's speech was to reverse Trump's slide in the polls and give nervous Republicans a sense that Trump can be reined in and directed to focus on Hillary Clinton--and a positive economic agenda. It's not worth wondering whether Trump will go off the reservation again soon, because of course he will. But it continues to amaze that the guy can appear relatively sane only during those rare moments when his campaign has planned a big speech and prepared the media for days. (The last one was about foreign policy, and Trump gave it in the same relatively relaxed way.) He's like an actor who puts everything into a night onstage and then hibernates for the next month. Except, as this campaign has revealed with frightening clarity, Trump doesn't hibernate after a performance. No, he lets his dark id reign. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/don_t_be_fooled_by_clinton_trump_polling_bounces.html	"You sort of know there is a convention bounce that you should sort of ignore, but why? What's actually in a polling bump? The recent Republican National Convention featured conflict and controversy and one very dark acceptance speech--enlivened by some D-list celebrities (welcome back Chachi!)--but it was still enough to give nominee Donald Trump a big, if temporary, boost in many polls. This swing, which occurs predictably in election after election, is typically attributed to the persuasive power of the convention, with displays of party unity persuading partisans to vote for their candidate and cross-party appeals coaxing over independents and voters of the other party. Recent research, however, suggests that swings in the polls can often be attributed not to changes in voter intention but in changing patterns of survey nonresponse: What seems like a big change in public opinion turns out to be little more than changes in the inclinations of Democrats and Republicans to respond to polls. We learned this from a study we performed during the 2012 election campaign using surveys conducted on the Microsoft Xbox. This was a highly nonrepresentative sample--much younger and more male than the voting population--but we were able to use statistical methods to create a daily voter intention poll that proved extremely accurate. The advantages of the survey were 1) people were allowed to respond multiple times, on different days, and thus we were able to track changes in individuals' attitudes, and 2) the sample was large enough, over 15,000 per day on average, that we could get day-by-day estimates of voter intention. Our Xbox study showed that very few respondents were changing their vote preferences--less than 2 percent during the final month of the campaign--and that most, fully two-thirds, of the apparent swings in the polls (for example, a big surge for Mitt Romney after the first debate) were explainable by swings in the percentages of Democrats and Republicans responding to the poll. This nonresponse is very loosely correlated with likeliness to vote but mainly reflects passing inclinations to participate in polling. When there was good news for Mitt Romney, more Republicans opted to respond to the poll; when Obama was riding high, Democrats were more likely to respond. The result was that large and systematic changes in nonresponse had the effect of amplifying small changes in actual voter intention. We can apply these insights to the 2016 convention bounces. For example, Reuters/Ipsos showed a swing from a 15-point Clinton lead on July 14 to a 2-point Trump lead on July 27. Who was responding in these polls? The pre-convention survey saw 53 percent Democrats, 38 percent Republican, and the rest independent or supporters of other parties. The post-convention respondents looked much different, at 46 percent Democrat, 43 percent Republican. The 17-point swing in the horse-race gap came with a 12-point swing in party identification. Party identification is very stable, and there is no reason to expect any real swings during that period; thus, it seems that about two-thirds of the Clinton-Trump swing in the polls comes from changes in response rates. Looking more broadly, we examined all five polling companies that had polls posted on Huffington Post's Pollster in July before the Republican convention and between the Republican convention and Democratic National Convention. Two of these polls showed large convention bounces, one medium, two negligible. We then looked at the change in proportion of support for Republican Donald Trump (versus Democrat Hillary Clinton) from before to after the Republican convention and compared it with the change in proportion of Republicans who took the poll (versus Democrats) from before to after the Republican convention. The correlation between reported swing in candidate preference and swing in party identification in the sample is 85 percent. That is, most of the movement is attributable to nonresponse by Democrats, rather than to any shift in support for Trump. Again, not only is party identification a very stable variable, but most of these polls ask party identification at the end of the poll, far away from voter intention, to avoid any contamination by how the respondents answer voter intention. And here is another graph, prepared by political scientist Alan Abramowitz, that shows the relationship between party identification (percentage of respondents who identify as Democrats, minus percent Republicans) and vote margin (Clinton minus Trump) in the Reuters/Ipsos poll over 10 recent days of polling--July 23 to August 1. Variation in party ID explains 90 percent of the variation in Clinton vote margin. Looking at individual polls in more detail, it appears that Trump gained among Republicans, but not among Democrats or Independents. Consider the CNN poll, which had wild swings from Clinton up 7 before the RNC to Trump up 3 after the RNC to Clinton up 9 after the DNC. We see that Clinton moved from 88 percent to 87 percent to 95 percent support from Democrats, while Trump moved from 87 percent to 89 percent to 89 percent support from Republicans. The part of Trump's post-RNC bounce that was not driven by more Republicans answering the poll came from a small consolidation of support from Republicans. They were not supporting Clinton before; they were stating ""no opinion"" or ""neither"" as their choice. Similarly, the part of Clinton's post-DNC bounce that was not driven by more Democrats answering the poll came from a sizable consolidation of support from Democrats. Her ""no opinion"" or ""neither"" went from 6 percent to 5 percent to 1 percent over the three polls. It is not a surprise when self-reported partisans come around to their party's candidate, nor are we claiming the conventions had no impact on attitudes. But in both cases the real swing was much less dramatic than would appear based on the bouncing polls. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Trump's Up 3! Clinton's Up 9!

Though Republican Senate candidates in competitive races are running well ahead of Trump for now, it is easy to see how his erratic behavior might start dragging them down. In the weeks since Trump formally secured the Republican presidential nomination, he has drawn almost as much attention for taking potshots at Republicans who've reluctantly endorsed him in the name of party unity as he has for attacking the woman he's dubbed ""Crooked Hillary."" It is hardly surprising that senior Republicans are panicking. Here's what's most interesting to me about Trump's shambolic campaign: By saying whatever pops into his head, regardless of what previous Republican candidates have been saying for years, Trump is greasing the wheels for other Republicans to abandon positions that are not terribly popular. This is not something Trump is doing intentionally, as far as I can tell. He appears to be largely indifferent to the fate of other Republican candidates. It just so happens that Trump's lack of discipline is giving other Republicans the opportunity to discard baggage that's been weighing them down for years. Earlier this week, for example, Trump declared that he favored an infrastructure program ""at least double"" the size of the one Hillary Clinton has proposed. Why double? Why not triple? What about a program a bajillion times larger? Trump's infrastructure musings were not the product of careful consideration. He has not closely analyzed America's infrastructure needs and developed a comprehensive and sustainable strategy for meeting them. What he has done is demonstrate to Republican politicians that deficit spending is acceptable, provided it's used for something that sounds appealing, such as bridges and roads. There are all kinds of reasons why just choosing a number at random and deciding we're going to spend it on infrastructure is a terrible idea. My own view is that public infrastructure spending in the U.S. tends to be extremely wasteful and that we ought to implement serious reforms before we even consider making new investments. But that's beside the point. For better or for worse, Trump is undermining the Republican taboo against deficit spending. Never do you hear him call for a balanced budget amendment, a not-very-good idea that conservatives have been talking up for decades. Does this mean that Republicans who've embraced Trump's infrastructure ramblings were hypocrites for attacking President Obama's fiscal stimulus? Absolutely, if you believe opposition to the stimulus was primarily about deficit spending. But opposition to the stimulus also had a lot to do with who benefited from that outlay. If you'll recall, the stimulus did a number of things, from helping state and local governments meet their payrolls to financing infrastructure projects to increasing transfers to low-income households and the unemployed. It's easy to imagine favoring some kinds of deficit spending and opposing others. To be blunt, Trump could be telegraphing that he has no problem with deficit spending on roads and bridges, because it will mean jobs for the kind of people he happens to like, but he does have a problem with deficit spending on, say, SNAP benefits for poor immigrant-headed households, because he doesn't like them. Who the hell knows? All we can safely say is that Trump has moved Republicans away from the fairly rigid anti-deficit stance they've maintained for most of the Obama years. Chances are Republicans would have abandoned this stance regardless once there was another Republican in the White House, but Trump seems to have sped up the process just a little bit. Something similar can be said of Trump's repudiation of the Iraq war. At the beginning of this year's presidential race, most of the Republican candidates couldn't bring themselves to acknowledge that the invasion was a catastrophic strategic blunder. As a general rule, they wanted to move on to other, more congenial questions, such as whether the Obama administration had been wise in its handling of the withdrawal of U.S. combat forces from Iraq. Part of this reluctance to condemn the invasion no doubt flowed from the fact that most Republicans supported it and that it would be more than a little awkward to declare that they'd all been mistaken. Trump had no such compunctions. As the nominee, he's condemned Clinton for supporting the Iraq war, a bizarre role reversal that few other Republicans could have pulled off. Does Trump have a credible case that his judgment on Iraq was superior to Clinton's? Not even close. But his position on Iraq has allowed other Republicans to free themselves of George W. Bush's Iraq legacy. More broadly, Trump's inflammatory rhetoric is undermining the GOP's status as the party of the rich. The Clinton campaign has successfully wooed a number of wealthy Republican donors to the Democratic side, including Meg Whitman, the former CEO of eBay, and Seth Klarman, billionaire founder of the Baupost Group. Many other wealthy conservatives are choosing to sit this election out rather than support Trump. Drawing on data from the Center for Responsive Politics, John Carney and Anupreeta Das of the Wall Street Journal recently reported that people working in the financial services industry have donated $41.4 million to Clinton and pro-Clinton groups and $109,004 to Trump and to pro-Trump groups. One assumes that Trump's haul from hedge funders and private equity investors will increase in the months to come, as his campaign has only started soliciting contributions in the past few weeks. In July alone, Trump and the Republican National Committee managed to raise $82 million, at least some of which surely came from Wall Street. But unlike Mitt Romney in 2012, it looks increasingly likely that Trump will raise more from small donations than from large ones. What does this all mean? For one thing, it means Trump is under no obligation to defend Wall Street's interests over the coming months. Whether Trump wins or loses in November, he will have demonstrated that there is a path to the winning the GOP presidential nomination that owes nothing to the wealthiest members of the party's donor base. Trump will probably lose, but if he loses by a more or less respectable margin, ambitious Republicans will surely be tempted to recreate his coalition, working under the assumption that a candidate who was less of a lunatic might have secured a victory. If I were a senior Republican, I'd be panicking too. Donald Trump isn't just making their lives more difficult. He is actively destroying the Wall Street-friendly GOP they know and love.

7	7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/why_mormons_don_t_like_donald_trump.html	"""I love the Mormons,"" Donald Trump told a crowd of a thousand supporters at a Salt Lake City rally the weekend before the Utah Republican caucuses in March. According to Trump, the feeling is mutual. ""I have many friends that live in Salt Lake,"" Trump said. ""I've had many Mormons work for me."" Trump is counting on his supposed legions of Mormon friends to help him secure the heavily Mormon states of Utah and Arizona, both of which he needs to carry in November to have any chance of winning the White House. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or LDS, is the most reliably Republican religious group in the country. Despite Trump's claims of massive Mormon support, however, many Mormons have not looked fondly on his candidacy. In fact, most of Trump's Mormon friends must have stayed home on caucus night in Utah. He finished third (14 percent) to Ted Cruz (69.2 percent) and John Kasich (16.8 percent). Things haven't looked much better since. A poll from earlier in the summer showed Clinton and Trump tied at 35 percent. The Clinton campaign is confident enough that the state is up for grabs that it's sending Bill Clinton to campaign there later this month. Utah hasn't voted Democratic since 1964. In 2012, Mitt Romney carried it by 48 points. Romney, the most famous Mormon in the world, is also the most famous Never Trumper, which surely hasn't helped the candidate's cause. Yet Mormon wariness towards Trump goes beyond the GOP's 2012 presidential nominee. In early July, at a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill intended to build party unity, Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona--another prominent Latter-day Saint whose Mormon pioneer ancestors helped settle northern Arizona--confronted Trump about his attacks against Mexicans and against Gonzalo Curiel, the Mexican American judge overseeing the Trump University lawsuit. The Mormon distaste for Trump also goes beyond establishment Republicans like Romney and Flake. In late June, Tea Party-backed Sen. Mike Lee of Utah responded angrily to a conservative radio host who chastised him for failing to toe the party line and endorse Trump. To explain his refusal to back the nominee, Lee pointed to Trump's ""religiously intolerant"" statements, which have made him ""widely unpopular in my state, in part because my state consists of people who are members of a religious minority church."" Citing one of the darkest days of the Mormons' long history of enduring state-sponsored religious persecution, Lee continued, the Mormons are ""a people who were ordered exterminated by the governor of Missouri in 1838. And statements like ... [banning Muslims from the U.S.] make them nervous."" In Cleveland, at the Republican National Convention, Lee was a vocal opponent of GOP leaders working to put down anti-Trump dissent. Lee and other Republicans anxious about the Trump nomination tried to secure a rules package that would have unbound delegates from state primary and caucus results and allowed them to ""vote their conscience."" In May, the man Mike Lee unseated in the Senate through a primary challenge, Bob Bennett, spent his last breaths bemoaning Trump's bigoted stance on Islam and hoping to repair the breach. Days before he died, from his bed in the George Washington University Hospital, Bennett, who had been left partially paralyzed by a stroke, asked his son, ""Are there any Muslims in the hospital? I'd love to go up to every single one of them to thank them for being in this country and to apologize to them on behalf of the Republican Party for Donald Trump."" From the outset of his unlikely candidacy, there was speculation that Trump, the thrice-married, former pro-choice Democrat, would have trouble winning over religious conservatives. But as more (white) Protestant leaders and laypeople have moved toward Trump during and after the primaries, Mormons haven't budged. Trump hopes that the members of his evangelical advisory board and his pick of the self-described ""evangelical Catholic"" Mike Pence as his running mate will bring evangelical and Mormon ""values voters"" into his coalition. Many Mormon voters share the same pro-life, anti-gay marriage beliefs as other religious Republicans (a fact that Romney tried to exploit in 2012 by presenting himself as a ""culture warrior""). Yet the values of the evangelicals backing Trump don't exactly align with what Utah's Republican Gov. Gary Herbert--another Mormon who has publicly opposed Trump--has described as ""Utah values."" By ""Utah values,"" Herbert means Mormon values. Mormons make up 60 percent of the state's population and dominate Utah's political and cultural landscape. These Mormon values include more than just objecting to Trump's baleful and juvenile personal style, ""the bullying, the greed, the showing off, the misogyny, the absurd third grade theatrics,"" as Mitt Romney famously summarized it during his anti-Trump speech at the University of Utah in March. As Romney suggested in the same speech, Utah values also conflict with a campaign that is based almost exclusively on creating ""scapegoats of Muslims and Mexican immigrants""--all in the hopes of stoking white Americans' economic and racial anxieties. The Mormons know something about being scapegoats. The church and its members haven't forgotten that the Mormon past was in large measure defined by state-sponsored persecution and even violence. But the Mormons' reluctance to embrace Trump is also connected to the Mormon present. Mormonism is an increasingly global religious movement that is experiencing some of its largest growth in Latin America, especially Mexico. Let's start with the Mormon past. The fact that the Mormons became so thoroughly connected with the Republican Party may today seem inevitable. But that is not the case. The Republican Party was founded not only as an anti-slavery party but also as an anti-Mormon party. On their first presidential platform in 1856, the Republicans vowed to fight the spread of the ""twin relics of barbarism--Polygamy and Slavery."" Throughout much of the rest of the 19th century, Republicans in Congress and in the White House led efforts to pass and enforce anti-polygamy laws. As a result, many polygamous Mormon men were imprisoned. Others fled to polygamous strongholds in Mexico (including Mitt Romney's own great-grandfather, Miles Park Romney). In 1890, the LDS church announced the ""Manifesto,"" which officially ended polygamy and allowed Utah to become a state in 1896. Church leaders instructed their membership to join one of the two national parties. Some prominent Mormons urged Utahans to join the Democrats. Unlike the Republicans, the Democrats hadn't made it their mission to destroy polygamy, the signature cultural and theological practice of the Mormon faith. However, church apostle and future church president Joseph F. Smith, the nephew of Mormonism's founder Joseph Smith Jr., published a widely circulated treatise arguing that ""the people of Utah should be Republicans."" It's true that the party had been the Mormons' chief antagonists in the recent past. But Smith explained that the Mormons shared with Republicans a belief in hierarchal institutional authority. The Constitution--which the Mormons believe is inspired by God--established a hierarchy of responsibilities and powers, with the federal government at the top and state and local governments at lower rungs. Smith argued that it was the federal government's responsibility to guarantee citizens' rights--including the right to religious liberty--and to intercede in state and local affairs when those governments fail to protect those rights. Today, GOP ideals are much more defined by local control and fostering personal liberty by shrinking the federal government. But in the 1890s, with the memory of the Civil War still fresh in the national memory, the Republicans remained committed to federal sovereignty over the kind of states' rights ideals that had left the Mormons vulnerable to mistreatment.

Joseph F. Smith urged Utahans to recall the experiences of the first generation of Mormons, like those of his uncle and namesake. In the 1840s, Joseph Smith Jr. appealed to the federal government to protect his faithful from what the Mormons understood as unconstitutional abuses. In the run-up to the 1844 presidential election, Joseph Smith Jr. petitioned likely presidential candidates Henry Clay, James K. Polk, and John C. Calhoun. But the politicians refused to use the powers of the federal government to protect the Mormons. Such authority, they argued, was reserved for the states. As a result, Joseph Smith Jr. decided to run for president himself. He hoped that his growing national stature would insulate his community from further attacks by local anti-Mormons. The strategy failed. In June 1844, Smith along with his brother Hyrum was assassinated by an anti-Mormon mob. The assassins were acquitted in what many scholars have described as a sham trial.

Fifty years later, as Mormons vied for political acceptability, Joseph F. Smith reminded his people that the Democrats' states rights principles had failed to protect the first generation of leading Mormons. Now that the Mormons had placed themselves on the right side of the Republicans by officially ending polygamy, the Republican ideology of hierarchical constitutionalism was best suited to protect them and other religious minorities who, without the assurance of federal intervention when necessary, would always remain vulnerable to unconstitutional abuses by local and state officials (not to mention vigilantes) who viewed them and their faith as suspect. In the 20th century, it was the GOP's evolution away from the party of Lincoln and toward the party of religion and family values that wedded the Mormons so thoroughly to the Republicans. During the same period, Mormonism also evolved from a pariah faith to become an American religion synonymous with social conservatism, family, and piety. And yet, the impulse to side with political parties that defend ""religious liberty"" in a more inclusive sense than many evangelicals have done so recently remains a key part of the Mormon political identity. That helps explain the reluctance among Republican Mormons to embrace their party's current nominee for president. In Trump's anti-Muslim rhetoric, Mormons hear echoes of the anti-Mormon violence of the past. In the wake of the shootings in San Bernardino, California, last December, Trump proposed his now infamous ban on Muslim immigration to the U.S. The LDS church made an unprecedented entree into presidential politics to denounce the ban. While the church declared that it remained ""neutral in regard to party politics and election campaigns ... [the church] is not neutral in relation to religious freedom."" To demonstrate its long-standing commitment to American pluralism, the church included in its statement an 1843 city ordinance from Nauvoo, Illinois, the largest Mormon community founded by Joseph Smith Jr. before his assassination, which precipitated the Mormon exodus to Utah. The ordinance read in part, ""all religious sects and denominations"" including ""Mohammedans [Muslims]"" ""shall have free toleration, and equal privileges in this city."" Days after the church published its denouncement, Utah GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz (who converted to Mormonism while attending Brigham Young University) brought a similar message to a Salt Lake City-area mosque. Chaffetz told a group of 50 Utah Muslims that Trump's call to ban Muslims is un-American, immoral, and does not represent ""who we are as a people."" The Mormons' past has helped them empathize with the predicament of Muslim Americans; Mormon empathy for Mexicans is more a product of the church's present. With close to 1,400,000 church members, Mexico is second only to the U.S. as the nation with the largest Mormon population. Today, more than half of the church's 15 million members live outside the U.S., with the largest growth in Central and South America and Africa. It is also likely that there are today more nonwhite Mormons than white ones. The church's increasing internationalism tends to make American Mormons, many of who have served church missions in Spanish-speaking countries and Spanish-speaking areas in the U.S., wary of the kind of strident attacks against immigrants that have rallied other Republican voters to Trump's corner. The Public Religion Research Institute found that compared with 36 percent of Republicans in general, 45 percent of Mormons say that ""immigrants strengthen American society."" At the Atlantic, Jack Jenkins has noted that a large majority of Utah Mormons backs efforts to provide undocumented, law-abiding citizens a pathway to citizenship. So does the LDS church and the State of Utah. In 2010, the Mormon-dominated Utah state legislature initiated ""the Utah Compact,"" which called on immigration law enforcement to use their discretion to focus on routing out criminal activity among immigrant communities while taking care not to separate families unnecessarily through deportation. ""We must adopt a humane approach [to immigration],"" the compact reads, ""reflecting [Utah's] unique culture, history and spirit of inclusion."" In 2014, Dieter F. Uchtdorf, himself a German immigrant convert to Mormonism, and a member of the LDS church's First Presidency, met with President Obama and other faith leaders at the White House to discuss common-sense immigration reform. During the meeting, Uchtdorf offered the Utah Compact, which the LDS church officially backed, as a potential model for federal immigration policies. It's important not to overstate the Mormon embrace of Muslims or immigrants. Let's remember that most Utah Republicans' first choice for president was Ted Cruz, who is no champion of religious pluralism or immigration reform. Following the terror attacks in Brussels earlier this year, Cruz called on police to ""patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized."" Late in the primary race, Cruz also began to parrot Trump on immigration. ""We should deport [12 million undocumented immigrants]. We should build a wall, we should triple the Border Patrol,"" he told Bill O'Reilly in February. The next month, Cruz won almost 70 percent of Utah's GOP caucus votes. The day after the caucus, in the Washington Post, Emory University's Benjamin Hertzberg cautioned political observers not to read the Mormons' rejection of Trump as a sign that they can ""provide ballast to a GOP otherwise careering out of control."" Instead, what Herzberg saw in the Utah vote was ""the fearful calculus of a minority religious group that has legitimate concerns about the likely implications of the GOP's increasingly punitive policies toward the religiously different--but does not have the courage to embrace their particularity and leave the party entirely."" By voting for the ""marginally more respectable Cruz,"" the Mormons, who since the late 1890s have desperately sought acceptance within the conservative American mainstream, have ""stay[ed] in the closet."" But if the Mormons' chief concern was to protect their hard-fought political and cultural acceptance in the Republican Party, we might expect a majority of Mormons to have resigned themselves to the results of the primary process and to join Trump's movement. They haven't. So if not Trump, for whom are Mormon Republicans going to vote in November? For many Utahans, Hillary Clinton is (almost) as unpalatable as Trump. Emily W. Jensen, a popular blogger who also covers Mormon social media for the LDS church-owned Deseret News, explained to me that in the eyes of most Mormon Republicans, Clinton is ""amoral ... someone who accepts abortions and gay marriage and seemingly flaunts the justice system for her own gain."" With the choice between Trump and Clinton, Jensen says that many Republican Mormons ""are praying for a miracle""--often the miracle that Mitt Romney runs as a third-party candidate. Mormons on the political left--and they do exist--have started to call on their Republican Mormon brethren to pray for something--or someone--else. On the popular Mormon blog By Common Consent, Russell Fox, a political science professor at Friends University (and an avid Bernie Sanders supporter), posted an open letter to the ""Mormon Voters of the American West."" In it, Fox invoked the Mormon ""White Horse Prophecy,"" an almost certainly apocryphal statement attributed to Joseph Smith Jr. The prophecy foresees that one day, the United States will find itself on the brink of collapse, with the Constitution ""hang[ing] like a thread,"" only to be saved ""by the efforts of the White Horse."" Fox explained that for years Mormons have been misinterpreting the prophecy. The White Horse is ""not a reference to a [would-be] LDS President of the United States""--not a Romney, not a John Huntsman, or an Orrin Hatch. Instead, Fox suggested, the White Horse is ""the Mormon people."" Fox wrote that the ascension of Trump, who as president ""would apparently be comfortable with trashing the 1st, 4th, 5th, and 14th amendments,"" just might depend on winning the Western states, notably Utah and Arizona. If somehow Trump captures the Rust Belt and Upper South, it would fall to the ""Mormons and the newly enfranchised Hispanic population, which American Mormons are already more willing to work with than the rest of the Republican mainstream"" to ride in on the White Horse and stop Trump."

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/gop_leaders_plan_an_intervention_for_donald_trump.html	"Here's something funny: Republicans are going to try to change Donald Trump. Again. They are going to try to discipline him. This is what they're going to do, in some way or another, because they think they can still do it. It is August 2016, and there are three months until Election Day. They're going to give it what we'd like to think is one last go, but almost certainly is not. NBC News reported Wednesday morning that a ""candidate intervention"" is in the works. ""Republican National Committee head Reince Priebus, former Republican New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich,"" Chuck Todd and Hallie Jackson write, ""are among the Trump endorsers hoping to talk the real estate mogul into a dramatic reset of his campaign in the coming days."" (Chris Christie is reportedly not participating because he's still mad, for whatever reason, that he wasn't selected as aide-de-camp on this doomed mission.) This ""group of GOP heavyweights,"" they write with exceeding generosity, is also trying to rope Trump's kids into the talking-to. It comes after a roughly 48-hour period in which Trump screwed up in a dozen or so different ways--most egregiously, to top GOP minds, by refusing to back House Speaker Paul Ryan in his primary against some nut. The Trump campaign through official channels is denying that anything whatsoever is wrong, and Crooked Hillary will soon be toast. Gingrich says there's no plan for a ""formal intervention"" while vice presidential nominee Mike Pence says he's ""never heard anything about a meeting of that kind."" Priebus was reportedly so ""apoplectic"" Tuesday night, following Trump's comments on Ryan, that he made several sternly worded phone calls to Trump's staff. If you push Reince Priebus far enough, he may even go so far as to write a sternly worded letter. The imagery of the ""formal"" intervention is a little misleading. It's not going to be five or 10 principals sitting in a room, furrowing their brows and telling Trump in soft voices to stop being mean. It's going to be dozens of principals having small meetings and phone conversations among themselves, or making selective leaks to the press, trying to pass some sort of message to Trump himself that his behavior this week has been unacceptable. Trump can change, temporarily, when his back is against the wall. After his disastrous performance in the Wisconsin primary, he kept his mouth shut for a week and returned to form in the ensuing Northeastern primaries. When Trump was waging his campaign against Judge Gonzalo Curiel, murmurs began anew that GOP brass might withdraw its support en masse or consider nominating another candidate at the convention if Trump didn't zip it. So when Trump spoke in prime time following the June 7 primaries, he stuck to the 'prompter and read a snoozer, incident free. Priebus was pleased, Trump managed to go a few weeks without egregiously insulting everyone in his party and the United States of America. Attention turned to other controversies--shootings, the controversial cessation of Hillary Clinton's FBI probe--and he made the safe, party-unifying selection of Mike Pence as his running mate. He was nominated. Did Trump take his nomination to mean that he was unconstrained? The morning after his acceptance speech, he was at a press conference delivering an encore of his just-askin'-questions routine regarding Ted Cruz's father and the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Since the Democratic convention he has repeatedly criticized the parents of a slain soldier, because he is constitutionally incapable of not taking the bait. Tuesday's summoning of the Washington Post for an interview in which to exert dominance over Paul Ryan and John McCain wasn't controversial among elected Republicans because Ryan and McCain were desperately in need of his help. It was controversial because it showed that, given a choice between pursuing petty personal agendas and the sort of dull transactional politics that leaders rely on to build team trust, Trump will always pursue his reality-show grudges. They'll probably get the message to Trump, temporarily. Some threats about withdrawing party support en masse--in terms of both endorsements and money--may get tossed around. They'll show Trump some numbers about what his attacks on the Khans are doing to his standing in the polls. His children will plead with him. He'll read from the 'prompter for a week or so, offering the intraparty critics some sophisticated-seeming set piece like, say, an economic policy speech before the Detroit Economic Club. And after all that, Trump will do something, or likely a series of things, that we can't know right now but that will be worse than anything we've seen yet. He gets restless during his cool-down periods. This is just who Trump is. Everyone knows this, except for folks such as Priebus and Ryan who, rather than let Donald be Donald, on his own dime, and with his own set of validators, still think they can shake Trump out of it with any lasting effect. They're in denial. They're responding to their party's trauma by compulsively forgiving their candidate his many trespasses. Are we sure it's Trump who needs the intervention here?

9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/jacob_weisberg_s_classic_new_republic_profile_of_trump_adviser_roger_stone.html	"I wrote the story about Roger Stone reprinted below in 1985, when I was a college student, taking a year off to work as a reporter-researcher at the New Republic. This was Reagan-era Washington, where the old ideal of public service had given way to the service business of exploiting political connections for profit. What made Stone stand out in that tawdry scene was his utter shamelessness. He bragged about being a 19-year-old bit player in the Watergate scandal and about his friendship with Roy Cohn, Joe McCarthy's notorious henchman. Along with his partners, among them Trump adviser Paul Manafort, he engaged in campaign tactics no one else would admit to and took lobbying clients no one else would represent, including murderous foreign dictators. It became clear to me when I was reporting the story that Stone was less power player than con artist. He cultivated a reputation for being a bad boy, playing dirty tricks and crossing ethical lines. In practice, so far as I could tell, he was mostly shaking down his clients, who paid him a lot of money based on the largely false impression that he had real influence. He was a bluffer, implying he advised people he didn't, and a leaker, ratting out his allies in pursuit of his own agenda. After my story came out, Stone claimed it was good for his business. I don't think it was. After Jack Kemp dropped out of the 1988 presidential race, his only nationally known client was Arlen Specter, the late Pennsylvania senator. He would emerge every so often at the center of some bizarre gambit or scandal, advising Al Sharpton on a presidential run, leaving abusive voicemails for Eliot Spitzer's father, proposing to run for governor of Florida on a platform of legalizing marijuana, or publishing preposterous conspiracy books charging LBJ with masterminding John F. Kennedy's assassination. Showing off his Nixon tattoo and giving interviews in Miami sex clubs, he was the definition of a marginal political figure. Another seemingly marginal political figure has brought him back to prominence. Stone has had a long relationship with Donald Trump going back to their mutual friendship with Roy Cohn in the 1980s. For many years, Stone was a lobbyist for Trump's casino business. He was also the perennial leader of the ""Draft Trump"" campaign--the person who encouraged Trump's birther obsession and finally got Trump to run this year. In August 2015, Stone either quit or was fired from Trump's campaign. Nonetheless, he remains a Trump surrogate and dirt-dealer, most recently smearing Khizr Khan as a terrorist and predicting a ""bloodbath"" if the Democrats try to ""steal"" the election. Thirty years ago, I called him the state-of-the-art political sleazeball. And I've got to hand it to him--in the years since, no one has come close to taking that title away from him. * * * This story was originally published in the New Republic on Dec. 9, 1985. ""Roger Stone is back working in New Jersey and that could be bad news for state Democrats."" So begins a typical behind-the-scenes piece in the Trenton Times about the supposed enfant terrible of Northeastern political strategy. It seems the political consultant and lobbyist Roger Stone, who engineered Gov. Thomas Kean's 1981 campaign, has a plan for ""the creation of a permanent Republican majority for New Jersey."" Stone told the credulous reporter not only that he would install a Republican majority in the state Legislature in 1985 but that he would replace Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg with Kean in 1988 and elect Rep. Jim Courter governor in 1989. The Trenton Times in not alone in falling for Stone's self-generated image as a kingmaker. Ronald Reagan, Jack Kemp, and Richard Nixon all think he has the ability to drive nails into the coffin of the Democratic Party. Rupert Murdoch, Fortune 500 CEOs, and Caribbean heads of state pay Stone to lobby these men. He's part of a new breed of Washington influence-peddlers who help politicians get elected and then visit them on behalf of private interests. It is hard to say how Stone (age 32, salary $450,000) became the best in the business. But in looking at what he does, one discovers the art of political gold mining. If you're well-connected, and not too ideological or scrupulous, today's Washington is a boomtown. Stone's specialty within the powerhouse consulting firm of Black, Manafort, Stone, and Atwater is making Republican candidates appeal to traditionally Democratic voter groups: blacks, Jews, Hispanics, and especially blue-collar Catholics. ""If you can move them into the Republican coalition, you will have victory in the Northeast,"" he says. Because Stone, who managed the Northeast for Reagan in 1980 and 1984, is seen as having wooed these voters away from the Democrats, candidates for Congress and governorships are lining up outside his firm's lavish Alexandria, Virginia, office to pay him upward of $100,000 to work on their campaigns. ""He has tried to appeal outside the usual class of Republican voters,"" says Kemp, whom Stone is advising about the 1988 election. ""He knows the Republican Party has to drop its country club mentality."" It is often ironically noted that the foremost Republican authority on blue-collar voters has a taste for $700 double-breasted suits and Mercedes sports cars. But Stone is rarely attacked for his assertion that there is a science of winning blue-collar votes. When you ask him how he lured white ethnics to the Republican side, he says he appeals to them as individuals rather than as a group. When you ask for specifics, he says he emphasizes ""incentive economics and traditional values,"" as if Republicans would never think to campaign on those issues without his expensive counsel. Stone's partner Lee Atwater recently told the Washington Post that he studies the National Enquirer every week, since it's the literary staple of America's swing voter. All this ""expertise"" amounts essentially to a respectable veneer for what Stone and his firm really offer: connections, hype, and hardball negative campaigning. Stone is widely credited with making the difference in Thomas Kean's narrow victory in the 1981 New Jersey governor's race. This was achieved by portraying the liberal Republican contender as a conservative supply-sider. Stone convinced Kean to campaign on the promise of a tax cut; once elected, Kean raised taxes. He also convinced prominent friends like Kemp to do television spots for Kean, assuring him victory in the Republican primary. ""I don't advocate candidates' changing their positions--just trimming their sails,"" Stone says. ""I do have principles."" Stone's connections to the bigwigs of the Republican Party (or the illusion thereof) account in part for his tremendous popularity with wealthy unknowns. ""Roger lent me credibility,"" a Republican pol named Richard Bernstein, who lost a race for New York City comptroller, told the New York Times in 1982. It's a promotion racket--for $100,000, Stone tells small-fry candidates, you too can be taken seriously. But office-seekers like Bernstein hire Stone based on the impression that he handles the political future of everyone from Jack Kemp to Jeane Kirkpatrick. Asked about his oft-noted relationship to Kirkpatrick, Stone said, ""We talk politics--I take her at her word that she doesn't want to run for the Senate or for president,"" indicating with a wave of the hand that he advises her on her political future. Kirkpatrick told a different story. She remembered that someone named Roger Stone called her once. She said she didn't wish to sound rude, but they ""have no relationship whatsoever."" If the impressive names Roger Stone likes to drop don't convince you to spend your money at Black, Manafort, Stone, and Atwater, his reputation for ""hardball politics"" will. Stone's failed effort to elect Jeffrey Bell to the Senate in 1982 included wide distribution of photos of Bell's primary opponent, Millicent Fenwick, chatting with Bella Abzug and attacks on her supposed left-wing views, which are actually no more liberal than Gov. Kean's. The scurrilous congressional campaign Stone organized for Tommy Evans stigmatized Delaware incumbent Thomas Carper as a wife-beater. Often, as with the Evans-Carper race, the low blows backfire. But Stone rarely mentions the many second-place finishers he has backed--from Lew Lehrman to Prescott Bush--when he brags about his track record. He doesn't like to be associated with losers, even while he's working for them. In 1984 Stone backed Mary Mochary, who challenged New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley. ""Roger was characteristically bad-mouthing his client, saying she wasn't up to it,"" a fellow consultant recalls. ""He was being paid to say she would do well and already he was working to dissociate himself from her in Washington."" Stone's close relationships to Washington reporters are legendary. He supplies them with off-the-record stories and good quotes on background. In exchange, they print the dirt he plants about his enemies and hype his new clients and valuable services. ""He is an expert at dropping stuff unfavorable to his opponents,"" says a political writer who has used and been used by Stone for years. ""And he is very accurate. You don't last long at that game if you leak bullshit."" Several correspondents confirmed that Stone is one of the best sources in Washington for ""inside dirt."" On the Bitburg controversy, for example, Stone is said to have indicated which White House staffers insisted on proceeding with the controversial visit. None of these reporters wanted to risk losing a shovelful in the future by speaking for attribution. * * * Stone apparently has been at this business since early childhood. He says he became a Republican at age 12, after a neighbor in Norwalk, Connecticut, gave him a copy of Barry Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative. Stone was devastated by Goldwater's defeat but remained fully devoted to the party, rising through the ranks of youth groups like Teenage Republicans, College Republicans, Young Republicans, and the Young Americans for Freedom. As a 19-year-old student at George Washington University, Stone was the youngest Watergate dirty trickster. On orders from Committee for the Re-Election of the President  boss Bart Porter, Stone hired Michael McMinoway--known as ""Sedan Chair II""--to infiltrate George McGovern's campaign and report back. Using the pseudonym ""Jason Rainier,"" Stone made contributions to Pete McCloskey's campaign in New Hampshire in the name of supposed left-wing groups like Young Socialist Alliance. He then sent the receipts along with an anonymous letter to the Manchester Union-Leader. He also recommended that CREEP hire a fellow student named Theodore Brill, who was subsequently paid $150 a week to spy on ""radical groups."" Stone says that the ideas for this ""kid stuff""--none of which was actually illegal at the time--emanated from Charles Colson and that if he had refused to do it, CREEP would have fired him and gotten someone else. Stone's Watergate involvement made headlines again last year during the Edwin Meese confirmation hearings, when a note saying ""Roger Stone bagman for paid informant in McGovern campaign, kept his mouth shut so they can't touch him"" disappeared from Meese's 1980 campaign files. In 1974 Sen. Robert Dole fired Stone, who was working in his office, after Jack Anderson wrote a column detailing Stone's Watergate involvement. Unwilling or unable to work for elected officials, Stone worked on campaigns. In 1975, frustrated by how difficult it was for Republican candidates to raise money, Stone founded the National Conservative Political Action Committee with a friend from high school, Terry Dolan, and a future partner, Charlie Black. In 1977 he left NCPAC to become president of the Young Republicans. The next year Stone got his first taste of political consulting working for pollster Arthur Finkelstein (who actually does advise Jeane Kirkpatrick). Reagan's 1980 campaign director, John Sears, hired Stone for the campaign in 1979. Reagan fired Sears and Charlie Black on the day of the New Hampshire primary in February 1980. Stone stayed on for the rest of the campaign and joined Black's new consulting/lobbying form after the election. It was then, according to Dolan, that Stone moved closer to the political center, becoming more flexible on controversial social issues. ""You've got to be less ideological or it costs you money in that business,"" Dolan says. But Stone's moderation has cost him points with the far right. Paul Weyrich calls him a ""yuppie libertarian"" and claims he is responsible for Kemp's shunning of the religious right. Stone does not consider his Watergate involvement an especially touchy topic. According to his friend David Keene, a former strategist who is now a lobbyist/lawyer, ""Roger likes the aura of having done something bad in his past. You get the feeling that he's sorry it was so minor. He likes to say, 'Watch me, I'm a tough guy.' "" Stone cannot be said to shun disgraced Watergate figures. He currently serves as his friend Richard Nixon's ""informal liaison"" to the rest of the world. The much-publicized press dinners Nixon held at his New Jersey home last year were Stone's idea. He was also responsible for getting the 1984 Reagan campaign to talk to Nixon about strategy. Stone says he turns to Nixon for ""sage political advice."" He argues that Nixon retains ""a unique understanding of the electoral structure."" Peter Goldman and Tony Fuller's The Quest for the Presidency 1984 and Jack Germond and Jules Witcover's Wake Us When It's Over both relate the dramatic story of Stone, his partner Lee Atwater, and Reagan campaign manager (now rival consultant/lobbyist) Ed Rollins visiting Nixon in a South Carolina motel room. Nixon supposedly devised for the Reagan camp the so-called Ohio strategy. Both campaign books give space and respect to Stone's explanation of how this strategy--which amounted to spending a lot of money in Ohio because it has 25 electoral votes--was essential to Reagan's victory in an election where he carried 49 states. The authors seem so delighted to be getting the inside story that they don't notice they're being conned. * * * Black, Manafort, Stone, and Peter Kelly (a separate firm, since Atwater sticks exclusively to campaign consulting) have parlayed their success at consulting into a profitable lobbying business. Giver their connections, companies like Kaman Aerospace, Salomon Brothers, Johnson & Johnson, Rupert Murdoch's News Group, the Tobacco Institute, and the governments of Bermuda, St. Lucia, the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas, and Barbados are anxious to employ them as lobbyists. According to disclosure reports filed with Congress, Kaman pays the firm $100,000 a year to push its new naval helicopter. Salomon Brothers was paying the firm $6,000 a month for work on ""no specific legislation [that] is presently pending."" The investment banking firm is now paying these professed Republican ideologues $20,000 a month to fight Reagan's proposal to reform the law on tax-exempt bonds. Also according to the reports, the Footwear Industries of America trade organization pays the firm $50,000 a year to fight for import quotas on shoes. The financially beleaguered Chicago Regional Transportation Authority pays the firm nearly $40,000 a year for, to quote the answer to questions on the disclosure report: ""1. indefinite; 2. mass transit matters generally; 3. none."" The RTA says that $40,000 isn't much to pay for ""keeping the lines of communication open"" with Urban Mass Transportation Administration chief Ralph Stanley. Why are corporate fat cats, impoverished local agencies, and foreign governments turning in droves to Black, Manafort, Stone, and Kelly? ""My personal access to governors, senators, and congressmen is of value to a client,"" Stone says. He has no qualms about selling his ""access""--what used to be known pejoratively as influence-peddling. ""I've helped members of Congress get elected and next term asked them to look at an issue--I don't think there's anything wrong with that. It's not illegal."" Perhaps Stone learned this defense from fellow CREEP-ster Maurice Stans, who argued that his conduct was perfectly acceptable since it didn't violate the law. Stone adds that the question of a conflict rarely arises for him since most of his time is devoted to campaign consulting. But, he adds, his partner Charlie Black often lobbies Dole, whom he once worked for. ""It's no conflict."" A week after Stone made these remarks, Newsweek published a story on ""One-Stop Influence Shops,"" which said it was BMS&K policy for a partner who had worked on an elected official's campaign not to lobby that individual in office. When I asked Stone about the contradiction, he said he couldn't remember the conflict ever arising--although the rule prohibiting it was merely an ""internal decision on a minor point."" He repeated that the problem doesn't crop up, since his only two clients are the Bermuda government and Rupert Murdoch's News Group Inc. He says that Black ""handles the Hill contacts"" for Murdoch and that Bermuda isn't interested in domestic politics. (Perhaps the Bermuda government considers foreign aid a purely external affair.) Whichever of them actually handles it, neither Black nor Stone has filed the legally required congressional lobbying report for work on Murdoch's behalf. The firm has, however, registered at the Justice Department as a foreign agent for the News Group. When I called Stone to ask about the contradiction in the Newsweek story, he had a few questions for me. ""I track your steps everywhere,"" he said. ""Why have you been asking people if I had a falling out with Jack Kemp?"" I told Stone that I had heard a rumor to that effect. His friend David Keene mentioned that Kemp had become upset because Stone was ""repeating stories."" Another source confirmed on background that Stone was in the habit of gossiping about Kemp's personal life and that it ""got him in trouble with Kemp."" According to Keene, ""Jack said something to him and Roger has gotten a bit more cautious."" * * * Thereafter, few people I called could be restrained from describing the remarkable symbiosis between Jack and Roger before I even asked about it. Kemp's press secretary, John Buckley, called Stone ""Kemp's principal political adviser"" and spoke of ""Jack's high regard for Stone's intellect and instincts."" He said Stone was at Kemp's Super Bowl party. Shortly thereafter, Kemp himself called to say that Stone was a friend and that they spoke regularly about where he should be campaigning to keep his options open for 1988. It is impossible to prove that Stone and Kemp ever had a falling out, since they both deny it. It also doesn't really matter. What is interesting is how anxious Stone became over what hardly amounts to an allegation--although he seemed unconcerned that my piece would describe in detail his involvement in Watergate. Kemp is Stone's ""only game in town,"" according to one rival consultant. But the general perception that Stone, and his partner Charlie Black, are close to Kemp brings more wealthy candidates, corporations, and crowned heads to the firm. If word got out that Stone had a falling out with one of the Republican front-runners for 1988, it could prove terribly damaging to a business built on the fragile foundations of connections and access. Roger Stone's success at selling his connections is another symptom of what's happened to Washington under Reagan. Republicans are inherently no less devoted to their principles than anyone else. But an unprecedented number of Reagan's top aides, including Lyn Nofziger, Michael Deaver, Stone's partner Lee Atwater, and most recently Ed Rollins, have abandoned helping Reagan make conservative ideas reality in order to sell their connections to the highest bidders--whether in service of those ideals or not. ""I spent a lot of years doing things for love,"" Rollins told Thomas Edsall of the Washington Post. ""Now I'm going to do things for money. ... I think I can make between three-quarters and a million dollars."" All feel that after suffering on $75,000 for a few years, they have ""earned"" the right to bring home six or seven figures. * * * It seems silly to accuse these former public servants of selling out their ideals to greed when they advertise the same themselves. Negative publicity about abuse of privilege selling ""access"" only attracts business by proving that their connections are real enough for someone to deplore them. Ken Auletta wrote in his collection Hard Feelings that he was surprised when Stone's friend Roy Cohn was not offended by a devastating profile he published in Esquire several years ago. Cohn thought it a hatchet job, but was not overly upset since the piece reinforced his reputation as a ruthless advocate for his clients. Likewise, Stone doesn't chafe at allegations of dirty tricks, since they demonstrate that he plays hardball politics. Consultant/lobbyists believe, like Nietzsche, that whatever doesn't kill them makes them stronger. Most political strategists hope to win elections so they can join the government and implement their ideas. After Reagan was elected, Stone turned down the high-powered deputyship Rollins offered him. ""I would never take a job in government,"" he says. ""I'm interested in politics."" He claims to do his part for conservative ideals by helping to elect Republican candidates. Why then did he work for Ed Koch in his 1981 re-election bid? ""Koch ran in the Republican primary."" Stone added that he would never work for Koch as a Democrat. ""You can't work both sides of the street,"" he says. If those are his political principles, no one can fairly accuse Roger Stone of having betrayed them. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

10	10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/fivethirtyeight_vs_the_upshot_who_should_you_trust_to_forecast_the_2016.html	"What are the chances that Donald Trump will be the next president of the United States? If you've been following Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight, you've seen those chances steadily increase over the last few weeks, with Trump rising from a 23-percent longshot in the site's ""polls-only forecast"" to a 50-50 bet to win the presidency. As I write this on Aug. 2, in the aftermath of a sizable post-convention bounce for Hillary Clinton, the Republican nominee's chances have dropped back down to 34 percent. The New York Times' the Upshot has been a bit more consistent in its prognostications; its current estimate that Trump has a 26-percent shot to reach the White House is about on par with its recent projections. Though both sites aggregate polls to arrive at their predictions, their outcomes differ because they use different methods to assess those polls. Which election forecaster is right for you? If you want to keep a close eye on the latest trends, go with Nate Silver and FiveThirtyEight. If you'd prefer to avoid any sudden jolts, go with the Times. Silver does an excellent job spelling out the methodology for his polls-only forecast. (I'm focusing on the polls-only forecast as opposed to FiveThirtyEight's ""now-cast"" and ""polls-plus"" forecasts because it offers the closest parallel to the Upshot's methodology.) First, the FiveThirtyEight team collects a broad array of national and state polls. The polls are then weighted based on FiveThirtyEight pollster rankings, their sample sizes, and their recency before they are averaged in each state. In Nevada, for instance, the polling average currently shows Clinton beating Trump by just a tenth of a percentage point, 42.7 percent to 42.6 percent. Those numbers are adjusted based on both historical and current data to account for the effects of a bunch of different factors, including the presence of third-party candidates, biased polling, and national and state polling trends. The latter adjustment is particularly important when there are long gaps between polls and is helpful for reconciling poll results that seem like outliers. ""That's the part that says, well, we know that if Wisconsin is plus-6 for Clinton then Minnesota probably can't be pro-Trump even though there was a poll that came out there that had Trump ahead,"" Silver explains. After all those adjustments, the adjusted average shows Trump beating Clinton just slightly in Nevada: 44.2 percent to 43.3 percent. ""If there were 10 polls every day in every state, then you wouldn't have to do anything fancy,"" Silver says of the polling trend adjustments. ""But the point is that it's kind of naive to assume that if the national polls, say, have broken and moved 5 points toward Trump, that that hasn't happened in Ohio, in Pennsylvania, and Florida whether or not we have polls there."" The next part of Silver's method essentially constructs the context for the election, splitting undecided voters between the candidates and projecting the national popular vote using both national and state polls. FiveThirtyEight then uses statistical regressions that calibrate current poll results with those from the previous two elections, geography, and demographic variables such as race and religion. Those regressions are then used to simulate the election more than 20,000 times each day, and those simulations in turn produce both the probabilities of each candidates winning individual states and winning the election overall. The result: As of right now, FiveThirtyEight says Clinton has a 59.5-percent chance of winning Nevada to Trump's 40.5 percent. That's the case even though the two candidates were roughly even in the polling average and Trump actually beat Clinton in the adjusted polling average. Just two days ago, FiveThirtyEight gave Trump a 54.4-percent chance of winning Nevada. The odds have now shifted dramatically despite the fact that there's been no recent polling in Nevada. That's because Silver and co. use national polling trends to adjust their individual state models. Thanks to those national trends, Clinton's chances of winning the general election have risen to 66 percent compared to just 51 percent two days ago. The Upshot explains its methodology in less detail, though Josh Katz's write-up of the presidential prediction model does go over the general principles. Unlike FiveThirtyEight, the Upshot does not weight its polls based on pollster reliability, focusing exclusively on sample sizes and recency. The Upshot's regressions are also simpler than FiveThirtyEight's, relying more on past election data than the demographic information and regional groupings that Silver incorporates. The model is also designed to be ""slow to move."" Here's Katz's explanation:"	Who Should You Trust to Forecast the Presidential Election, FiveThirtyEight or the Upshot?	['Clinton', 'Trump']	[]
11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/cindy_sheehan_on_how_the_democrats_are_using_khizr_and_ghazala_khan.html	"One after another, reporters and pundits, hacks and flacks all began circulating George W. Bush's response from more than a decade ago to the protest of a dead soldier's parent. It was a lesson in manners for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who had just attacked Khizr and Ghazala Khan, themselves the parents of a dead soldier, for having denounced the candidate as an unpatriotic bigot at the Democratic National Convention. ""Compare Trump to Bush addressing Cindy Sheehan,"" tweeted a Daily Beast editor, echoing dozens of others. Cindy Sheehan's son was killed in the same war that later took the life of the Khans' son, and like them, Sheehan in 2005 was both a living rebuke to the Republican Party's vision and an asset to the Democrats in their mission to take back the House. A California soccer mom turned anti-war activist, Sheehan had set up camp outside of Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, where she'd planned to stay until Bush had granted her a meeting. ""This is America,"" Bush said at the time. ""She has a right to her position."" Now that, people said, side-eyeing Trump, is how you handle a critic. Civilly, dispassionately, respectfully. You can hear the Sorkin soundtrack swelling. Unless you're Cindy Sheehan. ""People started saying Bush was kind to me when I was protesting--that's incredible,"" Sheehan said softly over the phone. ""I was thoroughly bashed and attacked."" It's not an exaggeration to call Sheehan the face of the anti-war movement during the Bush years. Her son, Casey, was an Army specialist in the First Cavalry Division and, like Humayun Khan, he died in action. His mother's initial mourning hardened into a tireless public campaign to end the war, the apex of which was her weeks-long demonstration outside of Bush's ranch. The media eventually christened it ""Camp Casey."" Sheehan never got her meeting with the commander-in-chief. ""Bush said I was entitled to my opinion, which is really patriarchal in the first place,"" she said. ""But the idea that the administration treated me well is, you know, that's not what happened."" It's true, as the people tipping their hats to Bush have pointed out, that the president himself did not attack Sheehan the way Trump has gone after the Khans. But he didn't have to. He let his underlings do it. ""Cindy Sheehan is a clown,"" said Bush's senior adviser and dirty trickster Karl Rove, whose management of the media ecosystem was unparalleled. The Washington Post reported at the time that Sheehan was a frequent topic of conversation between the president and his advisers. And somehow, some way, Rove's sentiment trickled down into every pore of the conservative press. Bill O'Reilly called Sheehan ""dumb enough"" to get ""in bed"" with the radical left. Glenn Beck called Sheehan a ""tragedy pimp"" who was ""prostituting her son's death."" Rush Limbaugh said she was somehow lying about having lost her son. ""They were not only attacking me but digging into my background for anything that might undermine my character and undermine my message,"" Sheehan said. The hits rolled on. Paul Wolfowitz's favorite travel and party companion, Christopher Hitchens, accused Sheehan in these pages of ""echoing the Bin-Ladenist line"" and called her opinions ""wacko."" Others still called her a bad mother for not buying a tombstone quickly enough for her dead son. Michelle Malkin twisted the knife after Sheehan and her husband filed for divorce in 2005. Sheehan said she was too busy campaigning to care about the smears. ""I just buried my oldest son,"" she told me. ""And they're calling me names online. That isn't going to hurt me, or stop me."" But one thing did get to her: ""The scene I still see, and it's really amazing to me, is the right-wing started to lie that I didn't raise Casey. That I left his father and the family when he was 3 or 5 or 7--there are different stories--and that I didn't even care about him, and after he died I was using his death for political fame. And then they started saying if I didn't support what my son died for, I was a bad mother. I have four kids. To talk to me that way ..."" She trailed off. ""You can see Karl Rove's dirty claw prints all over that one."" Unlike Trump, Bush did it the right way. His team assassinated the character of his bereaved critic through the normal, respectable political channels. Meanwhile the man of the moment enjoyed plausible deniability and the praise of future journalists. Sheehan sees the Khans' story through the prism of her own sour experience in the public square. The villains aren't all on one side of the aisle. ""I think the Khans' grief is being used by a party that is treacherous,"" she said. ""I have all the sympathy in the world for them. Not only sympathy, but empathy."" She's not just talking about the loss of her son but also her onetime alliance with the Democratic Party. After ""Camp Casey,"" Sheehan was a key figure in the Democrats' efforts to reclaim power in Congress, which were predicated on riding, if not co-opting altogether, the moral energy of the anti-war movement. The strategy by the 2006 midterms was to rail against the now-unpopular war and regain a majority in the House. Sheehan met with members of Congress. She campaigned relentlessly. ""Every Democrat I met with in 2005 said, 'If you help us win the House, we'll help you end the war,' "" she recalled. Only one of those two things came true. ""Back when I was working with them after my son was killed, I was still a Democrat,"" Sheehan said. ""I still had some kind of illusion that they really cared about these issues the same way I did, but they really only cared about power."" The party did reclaim Congress, though, and before long Nancy Pelosi presided over a new bill that continued to fund the war to the tune of $95 billion. ""I felt really betrayed,"" Sheehan said. ""But since then I've realized they didn't betray me. It was my fault for thinking they would do anything else. If you pick up a rattlesnake, don't be surprised if it bites you."" She sounded unsurprised by the state of the party in 2016, shaken by a primary challenge from a (relatively) dovish, social-democratic coalition led by Sen. Bernie Sanders. Sheehan sighed at the idea of people at the DNC chanting ""no more war"" at the ex-director of the CIA and getting drowned out by a distinctly Trumpish chant of ""U-S-A! U-S-A!"" ""What Trump says is rhetorically belligerent,"" she said. ""But what Clinton and the Democrats actually did, it killed people. Why was the Khans' son in Iraq? Why was my son in Iraq?"" (Khizr Khan has made the same point, albeit a little more gently: ""As a Muslim American I feel that these policies are not in the interest of the United States of America. ... We have created a chaos."") ""That's where the debate should be,"" Sheehan went on. ""If you support Hillary, I don't really care, but you need to know what you're supporting."" She met Hillary in 2005, after Hollywood producer and Clinton backer Steve Bing arranged an introduction. ""I was with my sister and another Gold Star mother,"" Sheehan recalled. ""We poured our hearts out to Hillary about how the war has destroyed our lives, the lives of the people of Iraq, and that she had a strong voice and we'd appreciate if she spoke out and worked to end the wars."" Sheehan said Clinton didn't offer any comments; she just listened. Sheehan later picked up the Village Voice and learned Clinton had met with a different group of Gold Star mothers who'd apparently urged the senator to ""complete the mission."" Clinton said she still considered removing Saddam ""a good goal"" and rejected Sheehan's calls for withdrawal. ""Nobody has a greater right to make that criticism,"" Clinton said. ""But I happen to think that fighting for freedom is a noble cause."" These days Sheehan isn't doing much organizing. She is housebound in Vacaville, California, taking care of her sister Dede, who is sick with cancer. From a distance, she sees Donald Trump upending the political landscape, causing liberals to praise George W. Bush and conservatives to consider voting for their nemesis, Hillary Clinton. And Cindy Sheehan, loathed by the Republicans and abandoned by the Democrats, doesn't seem the least bit shocked. ""All these liberals are going, 'Oh, look, even conservatives may vote for Hillary!' "" she said with a laugh. ""And I'm like, yeah--why aren't you ashamed?"" Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Will the Democrats Fail the Khan Family the Way They Failed Cindy Sheehan?

12	12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/gop_denunciations_of_trump_are_soft_and_mealy_mouthed.html	"It's not hard to find Republicans to speak out against Donald Trump. On Sunday, Paul Ryan condemned the Republican presidential nominee for his attacks on Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the parents of Humayun Khan, a Muslim American Army captain who was killed in 2004 while serving in Iraq. Khizr Khan spoke at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, praising his son's valor and condemning Trump for his statements against Muslims, as well as his proposed ban on Muslim entry into the United States. Trump lashed out in anger, accusing Khizr of silencing his wife, which drew him into a battle of words with both the Khans and other families of fallen soldiers. Sensing a need to distance themselves from Trump's rhetoric, Republican leaders such as Ryan moved quickly. ""America's greatness is built on the principles of liberty and preserved by the men and women who wear the uniform to defend it,"" said the House speaker in a statement. ""Many Muslim Americans have served valiantly in our military and made the ultimate sacrifice,"" he continued. ""Capt. Khan was one such brave example. His sacrifice--and that of Khizr and Ghazala Khan--should always be honored. Period."" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had a similar response. ""All Americans should value the patriotic service of the patriots who volunteer to selflessly defend us in the armed services. And as I have long made clear, I agree with the Khans and families across the country that a travel ban on all members of a religion is simply contrary to American values,"" he wrote, restating his opposition to Trump's Muslim ban. On Monday, Sen. John McCain entered the fray with an even stronger statement. ""Arizona is watching. It is time for Donald Trump to set the example for our country and the future of the Republican Party,"" wrote McCain. ""While our party has bestowed upon him the nomination, it is not accompanied by unfettered license to defame those who are the best among us."" These are strong words from McCain, a former prisoner of war who won the Republican Party's nomination in the 2008 presidential election. But you don't have to look too carefully to see that something is missing from both this statement and those from Ryan and McConnell. There's no bite. These statements have strong language, no doubt. But neither Ryan nor McConnell nor McCain is prepared to withdraw his endorsement or add any conditions to his support. The GOP's nominee, their nominee, is railing against the parents of a dead soldier, and still they refuse to budge. To a degree, this is understandable. Trump is not the only candidate on the Republican ticket this fall. There are hundreds of down-ballot races and dozens of candidates who stand a real chance of winning. But their successes depend on strong and ample turnout from Republican voters--turnout that may not happen if congressional leaders abandon the party's nominee for president. So, in the name of preserving a GOP majority in Congress--and maybe even of electing a president who will sign off on tax cuts and other conservative legislation--key Republicans are sticking with the Trump ticket, even as their nominee weakens their party's national standing. Even Marco Rubio, who blasted Trump as unfit to handle the nuclear codes, is on board. As of this week, he's campaigning for Trump. ""We have to make sure that Donald wins this election,"" he said. At best, these half-measures are a failure of political imagination, as dedicated partisans struggle to reconcile their commitment to the Republican Party as an institution with their obvious disgust with a nominee who rejects their ideals in favor of raw, bigoted appeals to an angry and embittered group of Americans. At worst, they are acts of cowardice. Either way, the lackluster responses from Ryan, McConnell, and McCain and the outright submission of Rubio act as a confession of sorts. In their mind's eye, the Republican Party is a vehicle for ideological conservatism, a tribune of limited government and traditional values. Trump has shown the extent to which this is not true. He has demonstrated that Republican voters will forgive any kind of ideological deviance as long as it's paired with explicit prejudice toward assorted others, from Hispanic immigrants to Muslims to black protesters. Republican leaders will challenge Trump's statements and hope that he ""pivots"" to a more sober-minded approach. But they won't undermine him in ways that hurt; they won't rebuke him in the kind of language they used to attack Democrats and ideological opponents. They won't deny the truth of what Trump has shown about their party. Instead, GOP leaders--Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, and others--have opted to reconcile themselves to that truth. Under Trump, the Republican Party is the party of ethno-nationalist rage, and its most prominent voices are OK with it. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

John McCain on Monday released a lengthy statement rejecting Donald Trump's pushback against gold star parents Khizr and Ghazala Khan, who have spoken forcefully against Trump since Khizr gave one of the most powerful speeches of last week's Democratic National Convention. Various prominent Republican officeholders--like House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Trump's own running mate Mike Pence--have issued terse statements commending the Khans, but McCain's letter went long. ""I cannot emphasize enough how deeply I disagree with Mr. Trump's statement,"" he wrote. ""I hope Americans understand that the remarks do not represent the views of our Republican Party, its officers, or candidates."" Once he got that necessary grunt work out of the way, McCain moved to more florid ground. He wrote of his family's own well-known multigenerational connection to the military, and then retold the story of Capt. Humayun Khan's death in Iraq. ""His name will live forever in American memory,"" the letter determined, ""as an example of true American greatness."" McCain also wrote that he personally ""claim[s] no moral superiority over Donald Trump. I have a long and well-known public and private record for which I will have to answer at the Final Judgment, and I repose my hope in the promise of mercy and the moderation of age."" He was simply ""[challenging] the nominee to set the example for what our country can and should represent."" What McCain's letter did not do, as many observers were quick to point out, was renege on his prior support for Trump's candidacy. Near the end of the letter, the 2008 Republican standard-bearer urged his 2016 equivalent--with a tinge of threat--to cut the crap. ""It is time for Donald Trump to set the example for our country and the future of the Republican Party,"" he wrote. ""While our Party has bestowed upon him the nomination, it is not accompanied by unfettered license to defame those who are the best among us."" So far, Trump has accused Khizr Khan of suppressing his grieving wife from speaking because of some unknown Muslim code, said Khan had ""no right"" to criticize Trump, and went after Khan on Twitter. What sort of action, exactly, does Trump need to take for McCain to withdraw his blessing? Does Trump need to straight-up punch the Khans in the face? Does Trump need to punch McCain himself in the face? It's unlikely that McCain will ever drop his endorsement. If he does do it, though, it would almost certainly come after Aug. 30--the date of Arizona's Republican Senate primary. There are reasons beyond the completely cynical and personally craven for McCain to support Trump. As Republicans, they agree more than they disagree. As a Republican legislator, McCain would like to have a Republican partner in the White House. McCain would also not like conservatives to lose their Supreme Court majority, and McCain wants to respect the will of Republican primary voters. But perhaps more urgently, McCain would not like to lose own re-election this year. As I wrote in July, McCain faces both an underdog challenger, former state Sen. Kelli Ward, in that primary later this month and a well-funded Democratic challenger, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, as a potential opponent in November's general election. Border-state Arizona Republicans are a Trumpy lot, and McCain needs to appease conservatives in the primary and then ride them to victory in the fall. November remains the bigger challenge for McCain, but one development this weekend just made the primary less comfortable. Alex Meluskey, a businessman who was running in the primary and drawing a healthy chunk of the anti-McCain vote away from Ward, suspended his campaign on Sunday. The timing of this is perfect for McCain's rival, coming just a few days before early voting begins. Meluskey had been diluting the opposition to McCain, and some conspiratorially minded conservatives--like, for example, Ward herself--thought that Meluskey might have been on the take from the McCain camp. If he was, the payments must have stopped. ""Today Alex Meluskey has honored his pledge to Arizona Republicans 'to clear the way for the defeat of John McCain,' "" Ward said in a statement Sunday. ""I thank him for his selfless and courageous decision ..."" There is still another primary challenger in the race, Clair van Steenwyk, a regular protest candidate who may snag a few percentage points for himself. But the Arizona Republican Senate primary just got a lot closer to the head-to-head race that Ward wants with McCain. It would still be a shock if she ""retires John McCain,"" as she aspires to do. She would have a much better chance if McCain, right now, made a big show of rescinding from Trump his cautious endorsement. And that's the main reason why it's not happening. That's not going to stop Ward from trying to use this letter against McCain. ""The Khan controversy is a cynical political stunt cooked up by the Clinton Establishment, and, sadly, John McCain has fallen right into it,"" Ward said in a statement Monday. ""McCain's statement today makes clear that he really wants Hillary Clinton in the White House, and his tepid 'support' for Trump is only disingenuous pandering."" The statement went on to ""sympathize"" with the Khans for the loss of their son, an ""American hero,"" before switching back to Trumpian red meat:"	Why John McCain Still Supports Donald Trump Despite His Wild Attacks on a Military Family	['Paul', 'Clinton', 'Trump', 'McCain']	[]

In his prime-time address to the nation, Donald Trump painted a vivid portrait of an America in the grip of a terrifying crime wave, a nation in which violence routinely spills across a lawless border and where working- and middle-class families have been immiserated by the self-dealing machinations of a sinister globalist elite. According to Trump, the nation is on the precipice of disaster, and only a dramatic change of course, under his steady hand, can save us. Barack Obama's speech, in contrast, was a patriotic paean to America's promise. Throughout the convention, Hillary Clinton's partisans broke out in lusty cheers of ""USA! USA!"" Why have the Democrats embraced Ronald Reagan's vision of the United States as a ""shining city on a hill"" while the Republicans abandoned it? How is it possible that the politicians and activists assembled at the Republican and Democratic conventions are describing the same universe, let alone the same country? The answer is simple: In a very real sense, they're not. The fact that so many smart, thoughtful Republicans are so baffled by this role reversal is, to my mind, the reason Donald Trump emerged as the GOP presidential nominee in the first place. Successful politicians don't choose political narratives at random. They understand that voters' beliefs about the state of the nation are inevitably shaped by their life experiences and the ideological and cultural lenses through which they interpret them. That was as true in the 1980s as it is today. Consider a blue-collar worker who moved from a devastated Rust Belt town to a bustling Sun Belt suburb in 1984, just as the local economy was starting to boom. To this young woman, the idea that it was ""Morning in America"" felt exactly right. She had chosen to leave her past behind, and all the union bosses and tax-and-spend liberal politicians that came with it. Reagan's individualistic ethos resonated with her experience, and it made her feel like the author of her own life. But what of the blue-collar worker who remained in that same Rust Belt town and who lived through the nightmare of deindustrialization? What if this other woman saw friends lose their jobs and their homes, and what if she herself had to turn to food stamps to keep her family afloat? It's easy to imagine her scoffing at Reagan's rhetoric and feeling drawn to darker rhetoric. Democrats in the Reagan era didn't sound downbeat and nostalgic because they hated America, regardless of what their Republican critics might have claimed. They came across as pessimistic because they wanted to craft messages that resonated with their voters, many of whom felt their world was crumbling around them. What Donald Trump intuitively understands, and what all too many Republicans do not, is that for much of the GOP rank-and-file, 2016 is not 1984. Instead, the 21st century has felt like a disaster. From this vantage point, celebrating the status quo just seems perverse. Back in February, Johns Hopkins University sociologist Andrew Cherlin put forward a theory about why working-class whites are dying at higher rates than their black and Latino counterparts. Cherlin's hypothesis: Working-class whites feel worse off than their parents while working-class blacks and Latinos feel better off. If you're a white man in your mid-30s without a college degree, there's a decent chance your father enjoyed steady blue-collar employment and a stable family life when he was your age, and you do not. Native-born black men, in contrast, might compare their circumstances favorably with those of their own fathers, who often faced intense racial discrimination. Similarly, Latino immigrants of modest means generally believe themselves to be better off than they would have been in their native countries. That's no small thing. In this sense, at least, upwardly mobile working-class blacks and Latinos have more in common with upwardly mobile college-educated whites than they do with working-class whites. And in this sense, at least, the fact that the Democratic Party is now an alliance of college-educated whites and working-class minority voters makes a certain kind of sense. Like it or not, Reaganite optimism is not a particularly good fit for today's GOP. The sooner Trump's Republican rivals come to understand that, the better. Read more of Slate's election coverage."

While the campaign is insisting that Trump was merely referring to the spirited engagement of gun rights advocates, many have argued that, regardless of Trump's intent, the remark could be heard by some of his supporters as an invitation to commit acts of political violence. This is correct. But then, Trump makes dangerous, reckless comments all the time. The more revelatory, less familiar thing about his outburst on Tuesday is that it represents the rare instance in which he accidentally let slip the disdain he feels for much of his fan base.

16	16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/paul_ryan_s_clownish_challenger_paul_nehlen_is_about_to_lose_big.html	"Update, Aug. 10: Paul Ryan indeed vanquished his GOP rival with ease, winning at least 80 percent of the vote.

Donald Trump was able to win the Republican presidential nomination with relative ease. It's a different story for those down-ballot insurgents trying to emulate him. On Tuesday, in Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District, Rep. Paul Ryan's very Trumpy primary challenger, a man--and I do mean man--named Paul Nehlen, is expected to flame out in his bid against the speaker. He was a clown candidate who said dumb things and made howlingly awful commercials, and his loss today will be a comforting reminder that Trumpism has not yet gone local. Talk of a Ryan primary challenge began in December, when the new speaker of the House opted to fund the government. Like many of the omnibus spending packages ex-Speaker John Boehner would rush through during the holidays, this multitrillion-dollar behemoth included items to placate both Democrats and Republicans: a ""compromise bill,"" to use the dated parlance. The reason Ryan negotiated the spending bill was because he needed Democratic votes to pass and a Democratic president to sign it. For shame. And thus was born a RINO. ""The hunt is on to find a suitable conservative candidate who can beat Mr. Ryan,"" the Washington Times reported on Christmas Eve. ""The Ryan campaign team in Wisconsin has shrugged off the threats, treating them as mere talk in the absence of a viable candidate to mount a challenge in the district."" Some months later, rumor began to swirl of a challenger. Wisconsin Tea Party groups proclaimed that they had landed on some sort of businessman. It turned out to be Nehlen, an executive at a water filtration company and former Ryan supporter and donor, who now felt ""betrayed"" by Ryan's support of immigration reform and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. What does one do first when one wants to unseat the highest-ranking Republican politician in the country? One makes some terrible web videos. In ""Truth Resurrection,"" released May 4, our protagonist, sans sleeves to show off his killer tats, rides a motorcycle around the state and laments the loss of manufacturing jobs. He arrives outside an office of sorts. His arm candy--wife, maybe? She is not introduced--dismounts the bike and walks away, but Nehlen has a few things to say. ""I'm a businessman. I build things, create jobs,"" he says, still atop his hog. ""Jobs allow people to pay their mortgage, put food on their table, put their kids through college."" At this point, he takes his key out of the ignition, gets off the bike, and begins walking to the office door. ""TPP is a job killer,"" he says nonchalantly, back to the camera to show off the skull and crossbones on his shirt. ""It's gonna kill American manufacturing."" He walks inside, where suddenly he is wearing a business suit and goggles on a shop floor. A tough guy, Nehlen takes off his goggles and challenges Ryan to a debate. In the June spot ""Exposing Paul Ryan's Drug Problem,"" Nehlen wades through a shallow part of the Rio Grande River carrying a tub on which the word ""DRUGS"" has been spelled out in tape. He is wearing long pants and a long-sleeve, white button-down shirt. He is breathing heavily. ""Cheap Mexican heroin is killing Americans in record numbers, and it's gotta stop,"" he says. ""Paul Ryan had 18 years to fix this. He's failed."" The bin of DRUGS is shown floating on the water all by itself. Pan back to Nehlen's face: ""I want to keep the cartels from killing our kids."" Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District is a border district. It borders Illinois, though, not Mexico. Nevertheless, Nehlen spent some time walking the Mexican border in May with an editor from Breitbart. As with the candidacy of Donald Trump, Breitbart has served as Nehlen's staunchest media shill. But Nehlen's had other support from the conservative media circuit. Conservative writers Michelle Malkin and Ann Coulter have campaigned for him. Sarah Palin, too, dedicated herself to ""Cantoring"" Ryan ever since early May, when Ryan first refused to endorse Trump before caving a few weeks later. It was that stalled endorsement--""I'm not there right now,"" Ryan said--that Trump had a little trouble getting over, even if Ryan did eventually join the team. Trump, on Aug. 2, at first refused to endorse Ryan's bid ahead of his primary, mischievously telling the Washington Post that he was ""not quite there yet."" This came a couple of days after Trump gave Nehlen a shoutout on Twitter. The Ryan snub brought a whole new level of attention to Nehlen in the closing stretch of his campaign. That meant his usual mouthing-off on local radio shows picked up more attention than it might have otherwise. Consider this lovely sentiment expressed on Aug. 1:"	Paul Ryan's Clownish Challenger Is About to Lose Big	['Paul', 'Trump']	[]

Bush's White House, contemplates her impending vote for Hillary Clinton, she says she's ""stunned."" ""If you told me a year ago that I'd be voting for her, I'd say there's no way,"" Schiff tells me. ""But I feel that I have to. She'll do the job. She's eminently qualified."" There are a number of Republicans so horrified by Donald Trump that they're supporting Clinton, the GOP's longtime nemesis. According to Politico, more GOP defectors are set to go public this week, and the Clinton campaign will soon roll out an official Republicans for Clinton organization to mobilize them. Crucial to this mini-movement are Republican women. In this election, much has been said about the surge of blue-collar men towards Donald Trump. At least as significant, however, has been the rush of white-collar women away from him. According to a new Monmouth University poll, college-educated white women prefer Clinton to Trump by 30 percentage points, 57 percent to 27 percent. (In 2012, Mitt Romney won this demographic by 6 percentage points, 52 percent to 46 percent.) ""I think much of that is Republican women voters who simply can't vote for someone so vile towards women as Donald Trump,"" says Meghan Milloy, an employee at a right-leaning think tank who also serves as chairwoman of the group Republican Women for Hillary. In the past week, four high-profile Republican women have come out in favor of Clinton: longtime Jeb Bush adviser Sally Bradshaw, former Chris Christie aide Maria Comella, Hewlett Packard executive Meg Whitman, and former George W. Bush aide Lezlee Westine. None of these women, by themselves, is likely to sway many votes: But they represent a broader distaff repudiation of Trump, who continues to lead with men. ""Most Republican women will vote for Trump, because I think most Republicans will vote for Trump,"" says Katie Packer, Mitt Romney's 2012 deputy campaign manager. ""Partisan Republican women tend to act more like partisans than they do like women. But I don't think he will win Republican women with the numbers that Bush, McCain, and Romney did, and that's where these elections are won and lost: on the margins."" Packer says there are several categories of anti-Trump Republican women. Some, she says, ""are just giving up on the Republican Party and are saying look, I've tried, and now they've gone and nominated this guy, I give up. I'm going to go be a Democrat."" Others will vote for Clinton because they think Trump is dangerous--but will return to the GOP after this election. Finally, she says, there are people like her, who can't see themselves voting for either Trump or Clinton. ""I can't support Trump, but that doesn't mean I like Hillary any better,"" Packer says, ""and I want to stick around to try and help rebuild the party. We still hold hope for the party. There's very broad disgust with Trump, and people are deciding how to handle it in different ways."" How these disgusted women handle it will help determine what the GOP of the future looks like. When women decide to cast a vote for Clinton, they might develop a degree of loyalty to her. ""Once you make the decision that you're going to be for somebody, you look for reasons to reinforce that,"" Packer says. Milloy sees views about Clinton changing among the women she knows: ""I talk to a lot of folks that admit they can't vote for Donald Trump, came over to Hillary, and once they really got to know Hillary as a candidate and as a person, and looked into what she actually stands for, what her policies have been, her work on women's and children's issues, I think that they have gotten a better opinion of her."" This is far from universal among Clinton-voting Republican women. ""I'm unenthusiastic about Clinton,"" says Kori Schake, a senior adviser to John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign who now works as a research fellow at the Hoover Institution. ""I don't think she was a terrific secretary of state. I think what she did with her emails was illegal and unethical."" Nevertheless, Clinton has the advantage of not being Trump, whom Schake considers a ""genuine danger."" Schake is one of the 50 senior Republican national security officials who published a letter on Monday saying that a Trump presidency would ""put at risk our country's national security and well-being."" Until June, she thought she could be anti-Trump without being pro-Clinton and had planned to write in the name of one of her nephews for president. That changed when Schake saw how voters in the U.K. defied pollsters' predictions and elected to leave the EU. ""When I saw that the polls could be off by that much,"" she says, ""I genuinely worried that the polls could be off by a lot in this election, and we could all end up with Trump as president because we had indulged the luxury of not voting for Clinton."" Some Republican women who've decided to vote for Clinton find solace in all the things that disgust her left-wing critics. Rina Shah Bharara was elected as a Republican convention delegate in Washington, D.C., but was stripped of her credentials in May after she said on Fox News that she might vote for Clinton over Trump. During her fight to remain a delegate, she says, she signed an affidavit affirming her intention to vote for a Republican in November. She intends to honor that affidavit in a strict sense, but wants Clinton to win--and says she may campaign for her. ""I think she's closer to Republicans than most Republicans think,"" Bharara says. ""I think her party has gone to the left without her. She's not looking to go out there as a renegade, like, let me just totally shake things up. I think she errs on the side of caution."" The more Bharara watches Trump, the more attractive Clinton seems. ""If there are any more weeks like this past one,"" she says, ""I may end up at somebody's door wearing a Hillary shirt."" If Trump loses the election, one question will be whether the party can win back the women who are bailing on it. Several have been appalled by the way the Republican Party leadership has fallen in line behind a candidate whom they consider outrageously misogynist. ""I don't even know where to start with the disappointment,"" says Tiffany Barfield, who worked first for Laura Bush and then in George W. Bush's Department of Health and Human Services. ""How can you stand behind someone who defies everything that you stand for?"" In 2013, the Republican Party released a report about its 2012 failure; it was called the ""Growth & Opportunity Project"" but colloquially known as the ""Republican Autopsy."" (Sally Bradshaw was one of its authors.) Women, it said, ""represent more than half the voting population in the country, and our inability to win their votes is losing us elections."" Republicans, said the report, ""need to make a better effort at listening to female voters, directing their policy proposals at what they learn from women, and communicating that they understand what a woman who is balancing many responsibilities is going through."" Trump has not made good on this strategy, such as it is. After November, some say, it will be time for another reckoning. ""He has said some pretty horrific things about women, and most of our party leadership has embraced him and accepted him,"" Packer says. ""They're going to have to answer for that. There's going to have to be a denunciation of this guy."" Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

18	18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/why_aren_t_republican_leaders_dumping_trump.html	"This article appears in slightly different form in the Financial Times. Traditionally, the presidential campaign experiences a lull between the summer conventions and the Labor Day holiday at the beginning of September. Traditionally, political parties do not nominate someone as unstable and desperate for attention as Donald Trump. Rather than suffer a moment's repose, the Republican nominee has spent the past week testing the proposition that his own party will continue to support him no matter how outrageous and offensive his behavior. For Republicans who no longer have to face voters, Trump has made the decision to opt out an easy one. Both former Bush presidents have declined to endorse him or appear at their party's convention. Powerful criticism of Trump from Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, has helped to put Utah in play for the Democrats for the first time in half a century. Another recent defector is Richard Hanna, a Republican congressman from upstate New York who said last week that he would vote for Hillary Clinton--and who is not running for re-election. Conservative foreign policy eminences, intellectuals, and journalists have been breaking ranks even more volubly. The columnist George Will declared in June that he was quitting the Republican Party, prompting the predictable Twitter assault from Trump. Other leading voices on the right--including Charles Krauthammer, William Kristol, Max Boot, David Brooks, Robert Kagan, and David Frum--have declared positions ranging from could-never-vote-for-Trump to will-vote-for-Clinton. For candidates and party officials, however, calculation has pre-empted principle. Most do not think they have the luxury of conscience when it comes to breaking with Trump. Part of this is simple fear. Trump, a petulant and vindictive man, requires little provocation to unleash a storm of personal invective, along with his volunteer militia of digital trolls, at anyone who dares to challenge him. The larger factor is political realism. Republican Senate and House of Representatives candidates know that regardless of how strongly they may object to him, their fortunes are largely tied to their party's nominee. This is the predicament in which Paul Ryan finds himself. The speaker of the House says he hasn't written Trump a ""blank check."" That, however, is precisely what he did when he endorsed him, with exquisitely bad timing, just as Trump was going into bigoted paroxysms about the unfairness of a ""Mexican judge"" ruling in a lawsuit filed against him. A moving public plea to Ryan from Khizr Khan, the father of the Muslim American Army captain killed in Iraq in 2004, prompted no change of heart. Neither did Trump's extraordinary attack on Khan and his wife, nor even Trump's ostentatious delay in endorsing Ryan for re-election. There appears to be no limit to Trump's overdraft protection from party leaders. While morally untenable, their position makes sense from the perspective of preserving the Republican congressional majority. The past two decades have seen a trend away from ticket-splitting--voting for one party's presidential candidate and the other party's candidates for House and Senate races. This pattern suggests that if Trump goes down to a crushing defeat in November, Republican Senate candidates are likely to fall with him in key races in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio, Florida and New Hampshire. Efforts by down-ballot candidates to separate themselves from their party's nominee could easily make matters worse, alienating the base of Trump supporters without bringing meaningful gains among Democrats or swing voters. This leaves survival-minded Republican politicians in a pretzel-like posture. No one has faced a more yogic contortion than John McCain, the Arizona senator and 2008 Republican nominee. Trump appalled everyone last summer with his ghastly comment that McCain, a former prisoner of war who was tortured by the North Vietnamese, was not a genuine war hero because he had been captured. Last week, McCain issued a written statement saying he felt ""morally bound to speak"" in response to Trump's comments about the Khan family. As with Ryan, Trump pointedly postponed endorsing McCain in his upcoming primary race. For all that, McCain has not revoked his own endorsement of Trump. At some point the dam may burst, either because the level of cognitive dissonance required becomes intolerable, or because politicians perceive their interests to be served by formally breaking with Trump. This was the bet Ted Cruz made at the Republican convention, when he was booed for refusing to endorse Trump, telling party members to vote with their consciences. The Texas senator is gambling that standing against Trump will make him look principled and prophetic in 2020. A wider Republican abandonment of Trump, if it comes, will be about self-preservation. Last week, Mike Coffman, who represents a Colorado swing district with a large Latino population, aired an anti-Trump commercial in English and Spanish. The ad is titled ""Country First,"" echoing the charge that those surrendering to Trump are putting party ahead of country. It is a moral stand--as well as a candidate's desperate effort to save himself. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Why Aren't Republican Leaders Dumping Trump?

19	19	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/donald_trump_s_shrinking_electoral_map.html	Hillary Clinton's campaign and the main super PAC supporting it are pulling some ads out of Virginia and Colorado. Not forever: The super PAC, Priorities USA, says it will be back on the air at the end of the month, and the Clinton campaign says that at this moment it is still running a handful of Virginia ads. But consider the states where the Clinton campaign, at least, will continue running state-specific ads without interruption: Ohio, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire, and North Carolina. Apparently it considers Virginia and Colorado safer than all of them at this point. The withdrawals are shocking because these are not traditional blue states. Barack Obama converted them in 2008 and held onto them in 2012. It takes the mind some time to adjust first to the changing of the colors and then, after multiple elections, their deepening. But the numbers seem to check out. Clinton has always polled strongly in Virginia, and there haven't been any new public polls since the Democratic convention or her selection of Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine as her running mate--or, for that matter, since the beginning of Trump's ongoing nightmare week. Colorado, meanwhile, hasn't looked competitive for a while. Take these two states and their 22 electoral votes off the table and Trump's available paths narrow from a few to ... two. Let's start with the 2012 map as a baseline. Trump could flip Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania to get to 273. He could win Florida and Ohio, lose Pennsylvania, and then win Nevada, Iowa, and New Hampshire to get to 269--i.e., an Electoral College tie and a vote in the House of Representatives. There's still time for other states to enter competition: Maybe Michigan or Wisconsin starts feeling the red itch. And then there's always the path in which Trump wins every state, beautifully, by a landslide, look at these crowds, and it would be terrific, just terrific. Here's the problem with the first two scenarios. His chances of winning either Pennsylvania or New Hampshire seem next to none. It is strange how deeply observers have been entertaining the idea of Pennsylvania as a true toss-up state, as though the punditocracy is 100-percent composed of alarmist Ed Rendell clones. Some weird numbers have come out of the state, but it all averages out to a mid-high single-digit Clinton lead. As does New Hampshire. Trump has so few Electoral College paths--i.e., he's losing the election--because he is an unqualified, ungrounded, and omnidirectionally offensive presidential candidate. If you look at the narrowing of his map and the still-scant post-convention state polls, you can see early signs of how and to whom that's playing out. The arguments about how Trump could reshape the map have always centered on him rallying to his side white working-class voters, especially men, in overwhelming numbers. That's not happening. What he is doing, though, is turning off college-educated suburbanites. And that's why the narrow map you see is what it is. Consider Pennsylvania, which, according to legend, is always decided in the suburbs of Philadelphia. Well, about that: As MSNBC's Steve Kornacki noted on Thursday, Obama won the southeast counties of Pennsylvania by 9 percentage points in 2012, and he won the state itself by about 5 percentage points. The latest Franklin & Marshall poll of the state released Thursday showed Clinton up 11 points on Trump in a two-way race and 13 in a four-way race. She was leading in the southeast counties by 40 points, 60 to 20. Obama won Allegheny County--i.e., the Pittsburgh metropolitan area in Western Pennsylvania--by 14 percentage points in 2012. Thursday's poll had Clinton up by 19. It's not because Clinton's support had jumped, either; it was actually, at 52 percent, 4 percentage points lower than Obama's 56 percent. But while Romney earned 42 percent in Allegheny in 2012, Trump was sitting at 33 percent. That means you've got Republican-leaners in the Pittsburgh area not sold on Trump. It's not just the college-educated, suburban swing voters in Pennsylvania who decide these elections anymore. It's the folks in growing metropolitan regions around Denver; Northern Virginia; Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina; and Atlanta. These are people with whom Republicans at the very least need to improve on from the Obama years instead of scaring them away even further. We're talking 45-year-old suburban married women who are ready to vote against a third consecutive Democratic presidential term but can't bring themselves to do it, because the Republican candidate thinks it would be sorta cool to play with nuclear weapons and watch them go BOOM. Trump thinks he can stake his claim on the more demographically consistent states with higher numbers of voters without college degrees--Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire--but you don't need to be a yuppie to also fear a nuclear winter. And if your hatred of Hillary Clinton surpasses whatever global apocalyptic fears Trump has reintroduced to the day-to-day political discussion, bless him, then you were probably already a Republican. There weren't enough of them for Romney in 2012, and there look to be fewer for Trump in 2016. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign.

21	21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/why_is_donald_trump_so_obsessed_with_tv_ratings.html	"In January 2015, Donald Trump stood in front of an audience at the Television Critics Association winter press tour and told the assembled reporters that The Apprentice was TV's No. 1 show. Though that had once been true, the franchise had long since fallen into disrepair, and Trump's assertion met with, in the Hollywood Reporter's phrase, ""muffled laughs."" According to Dan Fienberg, who was there at the time on behalf of HitFix, reporters began to press Trump.* He clarified that The Apprentice was just the highest-rated show on Mondays. That wasn't true, either, as Fienberg pointed out to Trump. ""What if I told you,"" Fienberg recalls asking, ""you're losing to Mike and Molly every week?"" Trump was flustered for a moment, then he shrugged. ""That's just what I had heard,"" he said, per the Hollywood Reporter. Remember this exchange: I assure you Trump does. It contains what I'd propose is the secret of his campaign. If my theory is correct, it is as significant a moment in the cosmology of Trump's bid for president as his filleting at the hands of President Obama at the infamous White House Correspondents' dinner in 2011. Trump cares about ratings a lot. He cares about ratings because the value of a thing, in his mind, is entirely a function of its ordinal positioning. He's always talking numbers, one way or another. During one recent campaign stop, he counted up every reference that Hillary Clinton made to him in her Democratic National Convention address--22 in all. He also routinely talks polling data--mostly when the numbers are in his favor, but sometimes even when they're not. But no single metric matters more to him than television ratings--so much so that even polls are secondary for him. In an age of time-shifting and binge-watching, Trump's fixation on ratings might seem old fashioned, and it is. But it's also key to understanding how he thinks. Trump's fascination with Nielsen numbers is regularly evident on Twitter, where he's posted dozens of messages both celebrating his own ability to pull in audiences and criticizing others who lack the same allure. ""I'll bet Jimmy Fallon gets great ratings tonight!"" he boasted in 2013, prior to a late-night appearance. Similarly, in 2015, he sneered, ""I have been a guest on The View many times when it was [a] successful show. Now the show is dying for lack of ratings,"" at once convinced that he had attracted audiences and reluctant to attach himself to a program no one was watching. Similarly, when he dropped out of a primary debate, he prophesized that it would be a disaster for Fox's viewership. And though this proclivity predates his present campaign, it's long served as a political metric for him, as it did when he mocked President Obama's second inauguration for its ""record low ratings."" (Nielsen explained at the time that there was nothing unusual about the size of Obama's TV audience, but Trump has never let a facts get in the way of his love for convenient figures.) Twitter is an apt platform for Trump's numerical interests, not least of all because the site's like and retweet counters offer easily accessible metrics. What's better than bragging about boosting John Dickerson's Face the Nation audience? Presumably, knowing that 1,300 of your fans shared that news with their followers. Still, he exhibits similar tendencies offline as well, as he did at a New Hampshire rally in 2015 when he seemed to attribute the first GOP primary debate's 24 million viewers to his refusal to be politically correct. That claim was telling, indicative of Trump's conviction that people tuned in for him and him alone, even if they didn't know what he'd be saying. Since then, he's repeatedly shown that he thinks viewership numbers are a--perhaps even the--key marker of victory. After the conventions concluded, he thanked his supporters on Twitter, writing that ""Nielson [sic] Media Research final numbers"" indicated almost 4.5 million more people had tuned in for his speech than for Clinton's. (The difference was actually a less-significant 1.2 million viewers in Trump's favor.) Though subsequent polling would suggest that speech--and all the pomp surrounding it--had been disastrous for his campaign, edging out Clinton in this one domain was enough for him to take a victory lap. As he does elsewhere, Trump conflates ratings with reviews, and spectacle with the substance of the thing, effectively confusing cause and effect in the process. The latest example of Trump's mad pursuit of viewers arrives by way of his concern about general-election debate scheduling. On Twitter, Trump observed that two of the three debates had been scheduled against NFL games. That the sequence had been set by a bipartisan panel long before the NFL established its own calendar didn't stop him from suggesting foul play: Alluding to the DNC's alleged manipulation of primary scheduling, he concluded, ""same as last time w/ Bernie,"" before going on to lie about having received a note of complaint from the NFL. Silly as the whole affair was, Trump's surrogates quickly jumped on board, internalizing both the form and content of his complaint, with Newt Gingrich memorably proposing that the whole thing was ""rigged to help hide Hillary from the voters."" Fabricated as it is, this supposed crisis brings together a handful of Trump's pet preoccupations. Notably, it links his fixation on football masculinity--best embodied by his disastrous attempt to own a professional team of his own--to his proclivity for conspiracy theory. Above all else, though, it exemplifies his belief that what matters most is the number of eyeballs you can glue to a screen. Convinced that football will distract audience members who would otherwise happily watch him bloviate, Trump fears he'll somehow lose prestige. It's this anxious conviction that Gingrich--ordinarily an independent thinker, whatever his other faults--appears to have internalized, turning him into a ventriloquist's dummy puppeted by Trump's pursuit of numerical supremacy. Fittingly, Trump seems to have developed his fixation on ratings while working on The Apprentice, a connection he acknowledged while keynoting a 2014 National Press Club luncheon. ""I learned a lot about ratings through The Apprentice. Your television audience disappears in the spring,"" he said to the diners, proposing that an event was only worth doing if you could get enough people to tune in. Fienberg confirms this insight, telling me, ""He was No. 1 on TV for a brief period, and that's something he likes to point to."" In other words, The Apprentice was good for Trump because it offered him definitive, but temporary, evidence that he was the best. Ultimately, though, The Apprentice is revealing in other ways as well, not least because it suggests Trump was more concerned with the perception of high ratings than the fact of a large audience. Business Insider reports that, in mid-2015, Trump sent the publication PDFs of ratings data with handwritten annotations, trying to disprove assertions that his show's audience had shrunk. Sensing a weakness, Mark Cuban has taken to needling Trump by pointing out that, ratings-wise, his own show Shark Tank shellacked The Apprentice. Cuban was hardly the first to find this weak spot, though. Reflecting back on his Television Critics Association showdown, Fienberg told me, Trump was insistent in his denial of reality. ""He couldn't get around the idea that this was a moderate success by limited expectations,"" he said, attributing Trump's confusion to his inability to reconcile the present status of his series with the fact that it really had been temporarily at the top of the heap earlier in its run. Trump's ongoing insistence, against all evidence to the contrary that his show was No. 1, prompted laughter, Fienberg suggested, ""because he was holding to a myth that was being deconstructed in front of him."" Given that Trump, as BuzzFeed News' McKay Coppins has memorably shown, sometimes seems to be driven by resentment alone, the chuckles of that audience must have sat poorly with him. Examples of Trump's thin skin abound, including a snide note that Trump sent to Coppins shortly before the Republican National Convention, responding to a critical article from two years prior. For Coppins, however, the most important incident is surely the 2011 White House Correspondents' dinner. Coppins writes that Trump--in attendance as a guest of the Washington Post--""just sat there, stone-faced, stunned, simmering"" while the president hammered him ""with one punchline after another."" His humiliation that night fed the great furnace of resentment in the cellar of his being, leading inexorably--at least in this version of the Trump candidacy--to his first real run at the presidency. But think back to the bemusement of those television critics. Obama had refused to take Trump seriously, calling him a fool in front of a national audience. That must have been a slap in the face, but it also elevated Trump by marking him as a man worthy of the president's attention. The critics, on the other hand, were laughing at Trump's claim to be the best, demolishing the phony empiricism of the fantasy that sits at the foundations of his self-image. How else could he respond? They laughed at his ratings, so he went looking for a new way of getting ratings, the best ratings. From this perspective, Trump's campaign looks like something other than a pursuit of power: It looks like an attempt to show up a gang of bemused reporters and prove that Trump still has the biggest show on television. Worse still? He may be right. Correction, Aug. 5, 2016: An earlier version misstated HitFix as HitFlix. (Return.) Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/would_donald_trump_really_consider_dropping_out.html	"The past 24 hours or so have been a big adventure for Donald Trump. In a disastrous and distracted Washington Post interview, he declined to endorse Paul Ryan, who is facing a primary. He condemned John McCain, also facing a primary, for not doing a ""good job for the vets."" He downplayed sexual harassment in the workplace. He mocked and removed a mother and her crying baby from a rally. He suggested, again, that the election might be ""rigged."" He accused Khizr Khan, father of a fallen soldier, of being ""bothered"" by his plan to keep ""radical Islamic terrorists"" out of the country. At least one person close to his campaign said that the staff was ""suicidal."" There's more! President Obama condemned him as ""unfit to serve"" and pressed Republican leaders to abandon their party's White House nominee. Two high-profile Republicans, Rep. Richard Hanna and former California gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman, announced their support for Clinton. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus is reportedly ""apoplectic"" over Trump's snub of Ryan, and a group of Trump advisers are planning an ""intervention"" over his recent behavior. This isn't the worst 24 hours for a modern presidential candidate--that distinction goes to the day Thomas Eagleton told reporters he had been treated for ""nervous exhaustion,"" sparking a furor that ended after George McGovern forced him off the presidential ticket--but it's close enough that senior Republican officials are exploring their options should Trump drop out and leave the race for president. (The short answer is that the 168 members of RNC board would have until early September to pick a new nominee.) It's not unimaginable that Trump would flounce from the election. He's an impulsive, immature man, consumed with narcissism and obsessed with ""winning"" as a measure of basic human worth. The worst thing you could be, in the world of Donald Trump, is a ""loser."" And right now, he looks like one. According to FiveThirtyEight's ""polls-only"" forecast of the election, Trump has a 31.6-percent chance of winning in November. At the Princeton Election Consortium, Sam Wang puts Trump's odds at 20 percent. And in the Huffington Post average of all polls, he trails by almost 6 points, 41.1 percent to Clinton's 46.9 percent. Some of this reflects the Democratic National Convention, which gave Clinton a substantial boost in the polls. Still, the underlying trend is real: Clinton is ahead. Even worse for Trump is the fact that, in just a few months, he'll have to face Clinton in debates, one on one. He won't have the luxury of a crowded stage and a raucous audience. He won't be able to mug for the camera and get by with insults and bluster. Primary season is over, and his successful approach there--soak up all the attention, prevent voters from so much as learning the names of his opponents--won't fly anymore. He'll have to know his stuff. But he won't. He's Trump. And if he's anything like he's been in interviews and on the stump, he'll likely bomb the debates, failing in a way we've never seen before, much less imagined. Given the choice between potential national humiliation and dropping out of the race, wouldn't he leave? No way. If life is a dominance game and losing is verboten--and for Trump, both things are true--then the only thing worse than national humiliation at a debate or on Election Day itself is dropping out. Dozens of men have lost presidential elections. Some have even lost them in landslides. But Trump would be the first nominee to quit the presidential race. A world-historical loser who couldn't follow through to the end. Next to that, a rebuke at the polls is nothing. And keep this in mind: Hyperpolarization in the electorate gives Trump a floor in the national popular vote. Add structural advantages for the challenging party, and there's a decent chance that Trump comes close to Mitt Romney's performance in 2012, which would put him above John McCain's in 2008. A decisive loss but not an extraordinary one. Remember, too, that a losing campaign can still draw crowds and make a splash. Tens of thousands of people will still cram gyms and fields and stadiums to see Trump, even if he's losing. He'll still have the praise and adoration of millions of people; he'll still lead the Republican Party and command allegiance from most of its officeholders; he'll still have his brand. Trump can still feel like a winner, even as he careens toward defeat. Indeed, Trump wouldn't be the first presidential candidate who mistook the size of his crowds for the scope of his standing. Trump is enough of an egomaniac that he wants to minimize the sting of defeat. It's why he has questioned the schedule of the debates--in a failed attempt to alter them to his favor--and it's why he continues to warn his supporters of a ""rigged"" election. But the same narcissism that leads him to run roughshod over political norms is what will keep him from dropping out of the race. It's one thing to lose an election. It's something else to be the biggest loser who ever graced American politics. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Would Donald Trump Really Consider Dropping Out?

23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/_10_vile_things_donald_trump_has_said_since_the_gop_convention.html	"Shortly before the Republican National Convention, House Speaker Paul Ryan said he had spoken with Donald Trump several times about improving his ""temperament"" and sounding more ""inclusive."" In particular, Ryan said he had cautioned Trump about his attack on the ethnic heritage of a Mexican-American judge. NPR's Steve Inskeep asked Ryan whether he had seen any subsequent changes in Trump's behavior. Ryan answered: ""I believe he's going to endeavor, to try."" Nearly two weeks after the convention ended, it's clear that Trump is unreformed. It's not just his beef with the parents of a slain soldier: Trump has spurned the Constitution, ridiculed morality, and dished out ethnic, religious, and sexual slurs. As these outbursts have continued, Ryan has spoken out just once, ignoring the rest of Trump's offenses. He and other Republican leaders continue to support Trump. Here's what Trump has said and done since the convention while the GOP leadership, for the most part, has looked the other way. 1. Smearing a dead soldier's Muslim mother. During the Iraq war, U.S. Army Capt. Humayun Khan, a Muslim, sacrificed his life to save his fellow American soldiers. This past Thursday, Khan's father, Khizr Khan, spoke at the Democratic National Convention and pointed out that under Trump's proposed Muslim ban, Humayun Khan would not have been allowed into the United States. On Friday, Trump was asked to respond in an interview with ABC News. Trump immediately changed the subject to Khan's mother, Ghazala Khan, who had stood beside her husband during the DNC speech, wearing a hijab. ""She had nothing to say,"" Trump pointed out. ""She probably--maybe she wasn't allowed to have anything to say."" Trump was wrong: As Ghazala Khan explained in interviews and a Washington Post op-ed, she hadn't spoken at the convention because it's emotionally difficult for her to talk about her son's death. Trump simply assumed, based on her faith and appearance, that she was being oppressed. Presented with a Muslim man who had given his life for America, Trump focused not on the soldier's uniform but on his mother's hijab. And rather than praise Humayun Khan for thwarting a bomber, Trump shifted to a cultural critique of Muslims, the same critique Trump has been peddling since mid-June. This episode makes it clear that Trump's animus against Islam transcends the issue of terrorism. 2. Resisting religious nondiscrimination. After Trump proposed his Muslim ban in December, some Republicans warned him that discrimination on the basis of faith was un-American. They advised him to apply his immigration restrictions to countries rather than a religion. Trump is trying to comply with that advice legally, but he has signaled that he hates it and that he doesn't understand why Muslims can't be excluded as a class. In a July 24 interview on Meet the Press, Trump mocked his critics: ""People were so upset when I used the word 'Muslim.' Ooooh, you can't use the word 'Muslim.' "" He went on: ""Our Constitution is great. But it doesn't necessarily give us the right to commit suicide."" Trump has since repeated that criticism of the Constitution at campaign rallies. On July 28, Fox News' Brian Kilmeade asked Trump whether he had ""clarified"" that his ban wouldn't cover all Muslims. Trump replied noncommittally: ""We're going to territories. We'll see."" In an interview on Monday, Sean Hannity pointed out that nearly all Syrian refugees recently admitted to the United States were Muslims. He asked Trump whether this meant that U.S. officials were discriminating against Christians. Trump answered:"	"There Is No Trump ""Pivot.""

25	25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/trump_s_rigged_comments_are_corrosive_and_dangerous.html	"We have a tradition in the United States. When you lose an election, you take the L, and you move on. It's what John Adams did after he lost to Thomas Jefferson in the 1800 election, marking the first ever peaceful transfer of power after a bitterly contested democratic election. It's what Samuel Tilden and Al Gore did after their respective elections, in 1876 and 2000, when they won the national popular vote but lost the tally in the Electoral College. And it's what Richard Nixon did after losing the 1960 election in an incredibly close race with John F. Kennedy, despite evidence of fraud in Illinois and suspicions of it in Texas. We have a great track record on this count, with one exception in our 228-year history of presidential elections. (It didn't work out.) And we owe that track record to a set of shared norms about our political institutions. In the modern era, those norms are straightforward. We all agree in the principle of one person, one vote. We all agree that, in each state's Electoral College, electors go to the winner of the popular vote. And for the most part, we all agree that the major parties are legitimate groupings of citizens and interests, with a legitimate claim on power should their candidates win an election. That hedge--""for the most part""--is intentional. For the most part, we do agree that the winners are legitimate. For as much as Republicans worked to stymie Barack Obama's presidency through unprecedented obstruction, they never sought to delegitimize the election results or argue that his wins didn't count. At the same time, Republican lawmakers throughout the country--and especially in the South--have engaged in a project of voter suppression, animated by the barely veiled idea that some voters are more legitimate than others. They cry ""fraud""--ignoring all evidence to the contrary--and suggest stolen elections. It's corrosive and dangerous, not the least because these voter laws target black and Latino citizens in a clear echo of Jim Crow. ""Fraud"" is part of the backdrop of Republican politics on the state and local level, but conspiracy theorists aside, it hasn't bubbled up into national politics. Republican leaders opposed Obama (and Bill Clinton before him) and even challenged his authority as president. But they didn't attack the election itself, or suggest the results were illegitimate. Enter Donald Trump. Trump has no use for norms. He violates them at will, from relatively trivial transgressions such as his personal attacks on other presidential candidates (""Little Marco,"" ""low-energy"" Jeb), to the worrying ones such as his habit of spreading conspiracy theories (e.g., the charge that Ted Cruz's father helped assassinate John F. Kennedy), to the serious ones such as his calls for religious tests, his tolerance of white supremacists, and his exploitation (and occasional use) of explicit racism. Trump's contempt for norms has only gotten worse in the past few days, as he reacts to the Democratic National Convention--and his subsequent collapse in the polls--with rage and anger. And on Monday, he crossed one of the brightest lines in American politics, the one that deals directly with our tradition of peaceful transfer of power. ""I'm afraid the election is going to be rigged, I have to be honest,"" he said to a crowd in Columbus, Ohio. He followed up on this in an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity. ""I'm telling you, November 8th, we'd better be careful because that election is going to be rigged. And I hope the Republicans are watching closely, or it's going to be taken away from us."" This was in line with comments from Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to Trump. In a recent interview with Breitbart's Milo Yiannopoulos, Stone said that Trump should start talking ""constantly"" about the chance of voter fraud and a rigged election. ""He needs to say for example, today would be a perfect example: 'I am leading in Florida. The polls all show it. If I lose Florida, we will know that there's voter fraud.' "" Stone continued in this vein. "" 'If there's voter fraud, this election will be illegitimate, the election of the winner will be illegitimate, we will have a constitutional crisis, widespread civil disobedience, and the government will no longer be the government.' "" From here, Stone's language gets ominous. ""If you can't have an honest election, nothing else counts,"" he said. ""The government will be shut down if they attempt to steal this and swear Hillary in. No, we will not stand for it. We will not stand for it,"" Stone said, promising a ""bloodbath"" of ""civil disobedience."" You could say that there's nothing new here, that earlier Republicans have brought similar rhetoric to the table, and thus that this--if there's a difference at all--is one of degree and not of kind. In the aftermath of 1960, allies of Nixon alleged fraud. And again, in the wake of Obama's 2012 victory, Alex Jones and other conspiratorial figures obsessed over the idea that the election was stolen. But this elides fine details. For instance, neither Nixon's allies nor Alex Jones was a candidate for the presidency of the United States. This world we're in, in which a major party campaign maligns the election as rigged well before the fact and promises a proverbial ""bloodbath"" in the event of defeat, is a new one. It's possible that this is just impulsive nonsense from unscrupulous men with no bearing on the election. But I wouldn't dismiss it. Presidential nominees matter. What they say matters. Trump is a major party leader in an age of rigid partisanship. Not only has this bound reluctant lawmakers to his campaign, but it's given him a definite floor for votes in the general election. If he loses, it won't be a landslide. It might even be close. Which makes this language dangerous. A Donald Trump who accuses the Democratic campaign of fraud--who says Hillary stole the election from him--is one who has allies and enablers within his party. It's one who has an audience with millions of voters, primed to believe in an epidemic of fraud and stolen elections, where ""fraud"" often means black and Latino voting. What happens if Trump loses the election, and he claims fraud? What happens when hundreds of thousands of his most loyal followers--fed on a diet of anger and rage--convince themselves that the race was stolen from their tribune? The simple truth of American politics--and of democratic life at large--is that our institutions are only as strong as the norms around them. Those norms are the superstructure of democracy; they help us navigate conflict and mediate change. When they're violated, either by unaccountable elites or by reckless politicians, we suffer. And right now, one of those elites is undermining them for the sake of his own ego, stoking fear and distrust just so he can lose the election without losing face.

26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/obama_just_put_trump_backing_republicans_in_a_tough_spot.html	"On Tuesday, President Barack Obama took square aim at any Republicans who refused to renounce Donald Trump's candidacy in the face of his ever-mounting boorishness and incompetence, citing Trump's attacks on Gold Star parents Khizr and Ghazala Khan and his views on Russia. ""The question they have to ask themselves,"" President Obama said at a press conference, ""is: If you are repeatedly having to say in very strong terms that what he has said is unacceptable, why are you still endorsing him?"" Obama specifically name-checked the speaker of the House, the Senate majority leader, and erstwhile rival Arizona Sen. John McCain. These are not the only Republicans who have recently chastised Trump for his treatment of the Khans without withdrawing their support for the nominee. The super top-secret insider political reason that Obama said this is probably ... that it's something he believes and felt like saying? He is not the first commentator to take note of that missing final step in these Republicans' statements rejecting Trump's treatment of the Khans. ""There has to come a point,"" Obama continued, ""at which you say somebody who makes those kinds of statements doesn't have the judgment, the temperament, the understanding to occupy the most powerful position in the world."" Or there doesn't. Obama may or may not have been playing politics with his comments, but his comments will play politics all on their own. What he has done--and this is a sad thing, by the way--will even further discourage those already-squeezed GOP leaders or politicians up for re-election from reneging on their backing of Trump. If they do so now, it will look like they're taking instructions from the malicious Obama. If they stand firm, likelier than ever now that Obama has spoken up, they will continue to have the albatross of Donald Trump and his second-by-second nonsense hang around their necks. Obama may or may not have meant to torture them this way, but that's the most likely effect. Not all elected Republicans who have endorsed Donald Trump are doing so out of cowardice. Some, like Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, appear to genuinely like the dude. Others simply want a Republican partner in the White House--and Republicans in control of federal departments and agencies, where the real day-to-day moves to advance Republican goals can be made by more professional types. Others seem to have fully submitted to political pressure, and this pressure is of different sorts. The Republican National Committee has no agency here; its explicit duty is to help elect Republicans to higher office. Party leaders like Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan are too important within the GOP not to support its presidential nominee. Every other elected member of Congress is free to follow his or her own political and moral reasoning, but so far, no Republican in national office who's up for re-election has endorsed Hillary Clinton. Illinois' Mark Kirk, the most endangered senator in the country, has withdrawn his support for Trump, but that's as far as he's gone. With the Khan attacks pushing him over the top, New York Rep. Richard Hanna endorsed Clinton on Tuesday morning. But Hanna is retiring after this term. It would be shocking to see a Republican up for re-election jump not just halfway, to neutrality, but all the way to an endorsement of Clinton. Even if you're in a tight race and want to maintain swing voters, you still have to turn out your own Republican voters. And a sizable portion of Republican voters made clear in the spring that they like Trump. But as Obama pointed out, the constant routine of distancing without renouncing has got to be tiring--for both candidates and, especially, their communications staffs--and the option of untethering completely must get more tempting by the day. ""This isn't a situation where you have an episodic gaffe,"" Obama said. ""This is daily."" (We'd say that in these past 48 hours, it's been more of a minute-to-minute thing, but never mind.) ""There has to be a point at which you say, 'This is not somebody I can support for president of the United States, even if he purports to be a member of my party,' "" Obama continued. ""The fact that that has not yet happened makes some of these denunciations ring hollow."" And the fact that Obama said it helps ensure the pattern of these hollow denunciations, to the dismay of both Obama and the candidates issuing them, will continue apace through Election Day. Maybe there is some new bottom Trump will hit that spurs candidates like McCain--or Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, or New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, or Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey--into a total separation. Certain politicians may, for example, see Trump's refusal to return the political favor to them as the gravest moral offense there is. To paraphrase Donald Trump, though, the bottom just got 10 feet lower following Obama's endorsement of potential un-endorsements. Maybe if Republicans had spent the last seven years treating Obama as a reasonable person with whom they disagreed on certain issues, Obama could say something reasonable and they wouldn't feel politically pressured into doing whatever the opposite is. And maybe Donald Trump wouldn't be the Republican presidential nominee in the first place. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."

27	27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/08/would_democrats_accept_a_wackadoo_nominee.html	On the eve of the election, Slate's revisiting our best stories from the campaign. How did we get here? Read on. Republicans have faced an excruciating choice in 2016: Get behind their own party's mortifying nominee or cede the White House to a deeply despised rival. It's an easy call from the left side of the fence. Democrats are baffled when seemingly sane conservatives like Paul Ryan and John McCain promise to vote for the GOP's loony new standard-bearer. We tut-tut. We roll our eyes. We s our gdhs. But confronted with the same dilemma, I wonder how the left would respond. If a dopey populist surge somehow contrived to foist a wackadoo lefty nominee on the American electorate, how many of my fellow Democrats would feel obliged, for the sheer safety of the nation, to vote for an especially hated but well-qualified right-wing opponent? And how many would swallow hard and climb on board with the wackadoo? Or, as Ross Douthat put it Monday morning: Neither party has a monopoly on shortsighted, tribal behavior. It's not difficult to envision Democrats supporting an absurd candidate out of inane partisanship or in hopes (even gossamer hopes) of a precious November win. Do you doubt me? Let's posit a Donald Trump of the left: a radical celebrity, with no prior political experience, who tosses his hat into the Democratic ring. Could be Kanye West, or Ben from Ben and Jerry's. But for the sake of this exercise, let's say it's Sean Penn. Join me in a thought experiment that imagines Spicoli as Democratic nominee. It's a sunny Cesar Chavez Day at the beginning of our pretend election cycle. Mr. Penn has ventured far inland from Malibu, California, trailed by a teeming press pack, and is now standing with grave symbolic intent amid a field of budding artichokes. He kneels to pluck one from the earth, holds it aloft, and declares, in that raspy SoCal drawl, that his candidacy for the Democratic Party's nomination will be dedicated to the migrants. To the pickers. To la raza. To the unions, the underprivileged, the 99 percent. Penn's glamorous actress paramour stands beaming by his side as the cameras click. Penn's campaign launch meets with amused chuckles within the Democratic Party establishment. He's a sideshow. A man whose most recent accomplishment is a voice role in The Angry Birds Movie. A man who's attacked the media--with actual fists! A man who expressed heartfelt fondness for Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez and empathy for Mexican drug kingpin El Chapo. Penn brings star power to the process, but no one thinks he'll get anywhere. So the Democratic National Committee holds its tongue. It quickly becomes clear that a certain Bernie-ish swath of primary voters can't get enough of Penn. He rants about social justice issues with a raw ferocity that packaged liberal politicians never quite muster. He rips into right-wing enemies with salty language and palpable anger. He's a loose cannon on Twitter and seems nigh incorruptible. He commands the stage at large rallies, where folks come out just to see a Hollywood celeb. Over the summer and into the fall, he soars in the polls. Still, no one takes any of that seriously. It's Sean Penn, after all. The debates begin. Penn's performance exposes policy ignorance, an unwillingness to do his homework, and a general dimness swirled with arrogance. But there he is, always at the center of the stage, always getting the most attention, fighting with the moderators. To his supporters, he can do no wrong. They point to his humanitarian work after Hurricane Katrina and the Haiti earthquake. They argue that the pseudo-journalistic trips he took to Pakistan and Iran constitute foreign policy experience. And then the bomb drops: Penn wins Iowa. He's on his way. Stop here, my Democrat friends, and ask yourself how you'd react. Would you willingly cede the White House to, say, Ted Cruz if it meant keeping Sean Penn away from the levers of power? Or would you consider voting for Cruz just to stop Penn? I've been posing this very question to my own friends, of late. Most scoff, arguing it's a faulty analogy. Their initial objections break down like this:	If the Democrats Nominated a Left-Wing Trump, Liberals Would Totally Vote for Him	['Trump', 'Paul', 'Ross', 'Cruz', 'McCain']	[]
28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/07/sexual_assault_case_involving_refugees_in_idaho_in_the_age_of_donald_trump.html	"On the eve of the election, Slate's revisiting our best stories from the campaign. How did we get here? Read on. Last month, rumors began to ricochet around the city of Twin Falls, Idaho, that three Syrian refugees had raped a 5-year-old girl. Some in town said that the attackers, all juveniles themselves, held the girl at knifepoint. It was said that they urinated on her naked body and that one of the boys' fathers high-fived his son when he learned what he had done. At a City Council meeting on June 13, several residents of Twin Falls, population 44,125, questioned officials about the alleged crime; a man named Terrence Edwards linked it to the terrorist massacres in Orlando, Florida, and San Bernardino, California. He accused the police of perpetrating a cover-up. ""ISIS is here,"" he said. ""The Muslim Brotherhood is here. There's been violations already occurred by Muslims here."" The members of the City Council didn't know what to make of all this. At that point, the only coverage of the alleged rape had been a brief mention on local TV news of a police investigation into a  ""reported sexual assault around the Fawnbrook apartments,"" and the lurid rumors hadn't yet reached them. The council's failure to provide answers inflamed things. ""This was a pretty violent attack,"" Davis Odell told me later. Odell is a 29-year-old who started the Facebook group Justice for Our Children to demand a political response to the alleged assault. ""Where were the details? Why weren't they given?"" As she saw it, Twin Falls was protecting the reputation of refugees, even at the expense of the public's safety. ""The city has an agenda,"" she said. Soon the story of the alleged rape spread beyond Twin Falls. One resident provided an anonymous report to a right-wing website called BehindMyBack.org. The anti-Muslim blog Creeping Sharia picked up the report, and by June 20, it had migrated to Infowars.com, a conspiracy site favored by Donald Trump. The Drudge Report trumpeted the Infowars story with the headline ""Syrian Refugees Rape Little Girl at Knifepoint in Idaho."" The story circulating online was wrong in all its particulars. On June 20, Twin Falls county prosecutor Grant Loebs told the local newspaper, ""There were no Syrians involved, there was no knife involved, there was no gang rape."" He blamed anti-refugee groups for circulating misinformation. ""There is a small group of people in Twin Falls County whose life goal is to eliminate refugees, and thus far they have not been constrained by the truth,"" Loebs said. Yet as wild as the rumors were, they'd grown from a kernel of truth. There had been an incident involving three boys, ages 7, 10, and 14, and a mentally disabled 5-year-old girl; Loebs described it to me as a ""very serious felony."" On June 2, an 89-year-old neighbor discovered the children in the laundry room at the Fawnbrook Apartments, a low-income housing complex. The youngest boy is from Iraq while the older ones, brothers, are from an Eritrean family that passed through Sudanese refugee camps. (Most news reports have identified the older boys as Sudanese.) Only the youngest boy, Loebs said, is alleged to have touched the girl, though investigators suspect the 10-year-old might have as well; the elder boys reportedly made a video. Because everyone involved in the case is a minor, the records were sealed. Nevertheless, on the evening of June 20, Twin Falls Police Chief Craig Kingsbury appeared at the weekly City Council meeting to update the anxious public as best he could. He announced that police had arrested the two older boys the previous Friday and that they were being held in juvenile detention. (Loebs later told me that the 7-year-old was also charged with a felony but wasn't taken into custody because of his age.) Kingsbury laid out how the investigation had been conducted, elaborating the police department's procedures for questioning children in sexual abuse cases and explaining why it took weeks to charge the boys. At news of the arrests, the citizens who'd packed the meeting burst into applause. But many of them weren't mollified. Newspapers all over Idaho, as well as media outlets nationwide, had reported on the debunking of the Syrian gang-rape story, but some in Twin Falls saw the focus on the mistaken details--the ethnicity of the perpetrators, the presence of a knife--as a way to sweep a true story of Islamic violence under the rug. Julie Ruf, head of the local chapter of ACT for America--the country's largest grassroots anti-Muslim organization--took the microphone during the part of the City Council meeting set aside for public comment. ""The media swung very left on this, claiming that everything was inaccurate and that we were liars and we had no facts, that it never happened,"" she said to the assembly. ""And that needs to be addressed."" In addition to criticizing the coverage of the case, speaker after speaker stood up to denounce Islam and warn that terror had come to Twin Falls. A white-haired woman named Vicky Davis said, ""The nation of Islam has declared global jihad on us. And Obama, this administration, is bringing them in as fast as he possibly can. And why do you think he's doing that? Do you think it's out of the goodness of his heart? It isn't! There is a war on the American people! And you people are allowing the importation of these people, these people who have declared war on us."" * * * Liyah Babayan, 32, watched the escalating uproar around the sexual assault case with alarm. The owner of a consignment boutique, Ooh La La, and a member of the Twin Falls school board, she is one of the town's more well-known refugees. After escaping an anti-Armenian pogram in Baku, Azerbaijan, her family was resettled in Twin Falls in 1992. She is Christian--in fact, her family fled attacks by Azeri Muslims--but she has been frightened by the growing anti-Muslim sentiment in town. With her dark hair and olive skin, she's experienced hostility from locals who, she believes, see her as generically Middle Eastern. ""When the story broke out, I knew it was going to be this huge, huge flame,"" she told me. ""I became scared thinking there's going to be public justice, violence, protest. This is exactly what they've been waiting for. Like, We need them to do one thing. We need one of them to commit a crime."" With its cheap housing and 3.7 percent unemployment rate, Idaho is one of the five states that absorb the highest number of refugees per capita, with about 1,000 arriving every year. Most of the refugees are settled in the capital, Boise, but about 300 annually are sent to Twin Falls, located in an agricultural region known as the Magic Valley. There, the CSI Refugee Center, a nonprofit run out of the College of Southern Idaho, helps the newcomers restart their lives. Many in town are enormously proud of how their city has welcomed outsiders from around the world. ""This is a precious thing in our community,"" said Deborah Silver, an accountant and Democratic candidate for state Senate. ""We are a haven. Our community is a haven for people who have seen the unimaginable, people who have witnessed things that, thank God, I will never see."" The first wave of refugees arrived in Twin Falls in the 1980s from Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, as well as Eastern Europe. They were followed in the 1990s by people fleeing the war in Bosnia. In recent years, a growing number have come from the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa as well as Asia. According to data from the CSI Refugee Center, over the past five years, 187 refugees have come to Twin Falls from Iraq, 72 from Afghanistan, 143 from Sudan, and 144 from Eritrea. The largest single group, 233 people, came from Bhutan. ""The resettlement program really responds to crises around the world, and so populations change as time goes on,"" said Jan Reeves, director of the Idaho Office for Refugees. At first glance, it might seem like an odd idea to bring traumatized foreigners to a remote, conservative American farming town. Babayan remembers how baffled she was to find herself in Twin Falls as a child. ""It was night when we arrived,"" she said. ""The next morning when we woke up and walked outside of our apartment complex, there was just silence, no walking traffic, no car traffic. I felt like, 'This can't be America. Where are we?' "" But Zeze Rwasama, the director of the CSI Refugee Center and a Congolese refugee himself, believes smaller towns have advantages for refugees. ""The integration process happens faster than in big cities,"" he said. ""In small towns like this, everyone knows everyone. People are approachable."" Perhaps more importantly, Idaho's tight job market and sparse population means there's a high demand for refugee labor. ""To get a job is really easy and fast,"" said Rwasama. ""And most of those jobs are routine types of jobs; whether you speak English or not, you'll be able to get them. And the pay is not bad."" Many of the positions, in dairies and food processing plants, pay close to $10 an hour, he said, which goes far in a place where two-bedroom apartments can be had for $500 or $600 a month. The yogurt giant Chobani has its largest plant in Twin Falls, and refugees make up about a third of the workforce. Refugee advocates insist that the vast majority of Twin Falls citizens support the newcomers. But the spring of 2015 saw an outbreak of anti-refugee rhetoric and activism in town. It began that April, when a story in the local newspaper announced that the city would soon see an influx of Syrian refugees. Immediately, right-wing groups--some from outside of Twin Falls--began organizing to keep them out. In May, activists showed up at the College of Southern Idaho board of trustees meeting: some asking to shut the refugee program down, others demanding local control over which refugees came to town. Hearing about this contretemps, Ron James, a recently retired high school English teacher and supporter of the refugee program, went to the next meeting, which was held in June. There, he was shocked to see a group of men in matching black shirts from the militia group known as III% of Idaho. One after another, James said, he watched opponents of the refugee center accuse it of engaging in human trafficking and bringing diseases into Twin Falls. ""I took it very personally,"" he recalled. ""Many of the refugees move on to bigger and better things, but at the same time a large number stay here, too, and over 30 years, they've become part of our community. I know them. They're my students--some of my very best students. It's like, how dare you talk about these people like this? These are our neighbors."" In the months to come, there was a constant hum of anti-refugee activity in Twin Falls. A group called the Committee to End the CSI Refugee Center made repeated (and repeatedly failed) attempts to put an initiative on the county ballot calling for the termination of the refugee program. In August the American Freedom Party, a California-based white nationalist organization, blanketed Idaho with robocalls urging listeners to voice their outrage over the arrival of Muslim refugees, saying that the ""nonwhite invasion of their state and all white areas constitutes white genocide."" In July, local activists brought Shahram Hadian, an Iranian American pastor and ex-Muslim who travels around the country preaching about the dangers of Islam, to speak to two local churches. He returned for another lecture in September. In October, III% of Idaho organized a demonstration against the refugee program in Twin Falls; the Idaho State Journal reported that nearly 200 protesters, flanked ""by gun-toting men in flak jackets,"" marched to the College of Southern Idaho. On Nov. 1, the militia organized about 100 people to protest against the refugee program on the steps of the state capitol in Boise. The Southern Poverty Law Center quoted a III% spokesman shouting into a bullhorn: ""Now, refugees coming from Islamic hotbeds of terrorism, don't you think that poses a threat to Idaho communities?"" The crowd shouted back, ""YEAH!"" * * * This mounting demonization of refugees in Twin Falls has coincided, of course, with the rise of Donald Trump, who has called for a ban on Muslim immigration and has said that Syrian refugees are ""probably"" part of ISIS. People in town regularly repeat Trump's oft-disproven claim that there's no vetting process in place for refugees from the Middle East. ""We can take in some of the refugees, just not all of them,"" said Eric Odell, 35, the husband of Davis Odell, founder of the Justice for Our Children Facebook group. ""They're not vetting them, so some of them don't care about our laws,"" he said. ""They don't want to conform to our laws. They want to live Sharia law. And those are the ones we don't want here, where they believe rape is acceptable, and a woman's place is underneath their feet."" The Odells take pains to differentiate themselves from some of their more intolerant neighbors. Eric told me he ""can't stand"" ACT for America, describing the group as ""pure racists."" Davis used to work at the Chobani factory--she left after a viral illness incapacitated her for months--and knows many refugees who she considers wonderful people. Recently, she said, she and Eric joined Iraqi friends for Ramadan dinner. All the same, they believe that the influx of Muslim refugees into Twin Falls puts them in danger. ""Terrorists are already here hiding among them,"" Eric said of the town's refugees. ""Eventually something bad is going to happen."" The anxiety in town is so high, according to Davis, that some in Twin Falls were scared to demonstrate in solidarity with the alleged Fawnbrook victim, fearing it would make them targets. ""A lot of people are afraid of backlash from the migrant population coming after us for standing up for this one little girl,"" Davis said. Trump speaks to their sense that they are being besieged by outsiders, and to their resentment that they can't speak up without being called bigots. ""Trump is making progress in Idaho because he's saying what everybody's thinking,"" Davis said. ""Is he going about it the right way? He could be a little more tactful, but he's not a politician. He is somebody who understands. The refugee movement here, yeah, it's a problem."" For refugees in Twin Falls, it's frightening that more people now feel empowered to say that publicly. ""What was happening here happened before Trump got hyped up,"" Babayan said. But, she added, ""when Trump came in, it definitely gave more clout, a legitimacy, to those emotions."" Suddenly, she said, people opposed to refugees thought, ""There's a presidential candidate who sees it like us, and he's saying the things that we're feeling. And then you see the videos of the rallies. You've got a leader saying, 'Get those people out.' That energy spills out into the community, where the community says, 'Get 'em out!' "" Babayan has felt the growing anti-refugee animus in her daily life. People have left her angry voicemails; in one, a woman complained about how much it cost her to have her ""throbbing"" tooth extracted while her tax dollars paid for refugees' medical bills. Babayan's car was keyed; she's had nasty notes left on her windshield. In June 2015, she says, a woman who had been selling clothes at her boutique abruptly pulled all her merchandise, saying, ""I want to do business with Americans."" Later in the summer, she says, a woman who had overheard her speaking to her son in Russian walked into Ooh La La and said, ""If you want to live here, you need to live by the rules here. You need to speak the language of this country."" The woman threatened to deface the store's front window and told Babayan she would have her deported. (Babayan showed me the notice of trespassing she filed with the police to have the woman banned from the property.) In November, three men marched in to Ooh La La, one of them saying to Babayan's sales clerk, ""We're just looking to see if you have an American flag displayed in here."" * * * Even after it was revealed that the story of knife-wielding Syrians wasn't true, attention to the alleged attack in Twin Falls kept increasing. On June 22, the right-wing writer Michelle Malkin published a syndicated column titled ""Horror and Hush-Up in Twin Falls, Idaho."" ""Something wicked happened in Idaho's rural Magic Valley,"" Malkin wrote. ""The evil has been compounded by politicians, media and special interest groups doing their damnedest to suppress the story and quell a righteous citizen rebellion."" (Loebs told me that Malkin never contacted him to check any of the facts in her piece; if she had, he would have told her two of the boys were already in custody by the time it was published.) Donald Trump Jr. tweeted out Malkin's column, asking, ""Where's the outrage for this 5 year old girl???"" Two days later, Wendy Olson, United States attorney for the district of Idaho, attempted to ease the febrile speculation about the Twin Falls case only to end up fanning it. Her office issued a statement that read in part, ""The spread of false information or inflammatory or threatening statements about the perpetrators or the crime itself reduces public safety and may violate federal law."" This was constitutionally dubious. As Eugene Volokh pointed out in the Washington Post: ""There is no First Amendment exception for 'inflammatory' statements; and even false statements about matters of public concern, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held, are an inevitable part of free debate."" Olson's warning redoubled suspicion on the right that an official cover-up was under way. A Breitbart headline screamed: ""Idaho Refugee Rape: Obama Justice Official Threatens Americans Who Criticize Migrant Programs."" Amid the national uproar, Olson issued a follow-up statement to try to clarify her intent: ""The statement was not intended to and does not threaten to arrest or prosecute anyone for First Amendment protected speech."" It was too late. The narrative of a politically correct whitewash was further entrenched. The template for this narrative came from Europe, where in several cases authorities have been accused of hiding information about sexual assaults by Muslim migrants so as not to stoke jingoist reaction. In Cologne, Germany, police investigating mass sexual assaults on New Year's Eve--many by Muslim men--were reportedly told to keep the word rape out of their initial report. Earlier this year in Sweden, an investigation was launched into charges that police had covered up sexual assaults at a Stockholm music festival. ""[S]ome officials said the police force was concerned that assault reports could have boosted the far right,"" Reuters reported. For the anti-refugee right, Twin Falls demonstrated that this pattern had come to America. On July 5, the right-wing site WorldNetDaily ran a story about another reported rash of sexual assaults at a music festival in Sweden. ""Activists in Twin Falls, Idaho, have warned that the beginnings of migrant sexual assaults have been unlocked in their community due to the liberal refugee policy supported by President Obama and the GOP-dominated Congress,"" it said. WorldNetDaily and other right-wing sites continue to publish frequent updates on the Twin Falls case. Pamela Geller, co-founder of the group Stop Islamization of America, made plans to speak in Twin Falls, only to cancel her event shortly after it was announced due to ""security concerns."" Members of the City Council, as well as the city manager, have been deluged with furious emails. The local Times-News quotes one that police forwarded to the FBI: ""Have you any idea how many Americans are hoping and wishing your daughter, wife, mother, sister, aunt, or niece gets gang raped by those (expletive) piece of (expletive) sand (expletive) you're so (expletive) enamoured with."" According to the Times-News, the Twin Falls' mayor's wife, as well as two faculty members at the College of Southern Idaho, received voicemails accusing them of bringing ""humanity's lowest common denominator, essentially human garbage, from Africa and the Middle East, into the Twin Falls area."" The caller referred to Jo Cox, the British MP murdered in June by a man who shouted, ""Britain first!"" * * * For ""Lori"" (not her real name), the mother of the allegedly victimized 5-year-old girl, the narrative about Muslim predation makes sense of what has happened to her family. A stay-at-home mom who also has a son with autism, Lori told me via text that she has serious physical and psychological difficulties, including autoimmune hepatitis and debilitating anxiety. Over the course of the five days I spent in Twin Falls, she agreed to meet with me several times, but each time either canceled or temporarily stopped responding to messages. At the same time, she occasionally texted me unprompted and suggested I friend her on Facebook. Since June 2, her feed had been full of stories from conservative sites about Muslim violence. Said one of her texts: ""In the USA you have to follow our laws and obviously him raping my daughter in their country is OK."" (I have corrected her spelling and punctuation.) Lori told me that Julie Ruf, the ACT for America activist, is a close friend. She asked me to help publicize a GoFundMe account that Ruf created to raise money so that Lori's family could leave Fawnbrook. The families of the alleged offenders were served with eviction notices shortly after the older boys were arrested, but while the Eritreans had left, the Iraqi boy and his family had remained. ""I have to get out of here I don't feel safe living here anymore,"" Lori texted me. Fawnbrook is a collection of pale-yellow two-story apartment buildings in the thick of Twin Falls' centerless sprawl, surrounded by fields but a short walk to both Costco and Target. On the Saturday that I visited, a handful of members of the Liberty Defense Team--a ""survivalist-slash-prepping group,"" in the words of founder Robert Miller--had come to walk through the grounds in a show of support for Lori's family. Earlier, 20 or so members of the group had rallied on the Perrine Bridge, which spans the spectacular Snake River Canyon on the edge of town. They held giant American flags and hand-lettered signs: ""Where Is America"" and ""What if It Was Your Daughter: What Then!?"" Perhaps surprisingly, Miller disdains the provocative tactics of III% of Idaho, telling me, ""They try to make the news, we don't."" At Fawnbrook, his group was deliberately low-key. There were few residents outside when the Liberty Defense Team arrived, and no confrontations. Members of the Liberty Defense Team pointed out an apartment where, they believed, the 7-year-old Iraqi boy and his family lived. A woman wearing a black hijab was bustling around the open door. When I said I was going to try to speak to her, one of the Liberty Defense Team men warned me to be careful. ""Salaam alaikum,"" I said to her, and she beckoned me inside. Unfortunately, that pretty much exhausted my Arabic, and she didn't speak English. (I hadn't been expecting to speak with her and hadn't brought an interpreter.) She called a little boy over to translate. I don't know if he was the alleged offender or not; regardless, I wasn't going to try and question a child about what happened in the laundry room. Instead, I asked where they were from. Baghdad, the woman said. Then I asked whether they were moving. Clinging to his mother's side, the boy said they were, as soon as the new house is ready. Imad Eujayl, a Sudanese plant geneticist who serves as spokesman for the local Islamic Center, knows both the Iraqi and the Eritrean families. The Iraqi boy's mother is a widow, he told me, and has five other children. The Eritrean boys have since been released into their family's custody, but Eujayl said that the family is struggling since the eviction from Fawnbrook. Without a reference from their previous landlord, they couldn't rent a new apartment, and with the court case ongoing, they had to stay in town. They were living in another family's basement. All the boys are being represented by public defenders, but the public defenders' office won't release their lawyers' names. According to Loebs, they technically face a maximum penalty of confinement in juvenile detention until age 21, though he adds that with ""minors this young that is almost unheard of."" Lori texted me the address of the 89-year-old who had discovered her daughter with the boys. She lives directly behind the Iraqi family. I knocked on her door. The woman, who asked that her name not be used, said she'd initially noticed the older boy outside the laundry room, using his phone to take pictures of something inside. At first, she said, she thought he'd never seen a washing machine before, but when she went inside, she found children without their clothes on. ""All I saw was little bare bottoms, and the little girl so scared she didn't know what was going on,"" the woman told me. ""And she's still scared."" She said the girl was crying and the room stank of urine. ""It was the saddest thing I ever saw,"" she said. The woman said she took the boys outside and made them stay put while she called the police. Initially, according to what Police Chief Craig Kingsbury said at the June 20 City Council meeting, the call that came in was for something ""a lot less serious than a sexual assault or lewd and lascivious conduct."" But then Lori discovered what had happened and called the police herself, requesting medical aid. At that point, medical personnel and detectives were dispatched. Lori's daughter was taken to the hospital and the police seized the boy's phone, which contained a video of the laundry room encounter. The case will likely turn on what's on the video. According to Lori, while they waited for the police to arrive, the boy who recorded it handed his phone over to her fiance, who watched the recording. Her fiance, she said, told her it showed oral sex as well as their daughter being urinated on. I asked her if she knew why the boy had been willing to show this recording to his alleged victim's parent. ""Maybe it's what they do in their country, I don't know,"" she responded. ""But I do know that the kids in that country can and are used as sex slaves."" Loebs, however, told me that the girl's father only saw a ""tiny bit"" of the recording. The prosecutor was indignant at all the misrepresentations still swirling around about the case. ""I'm a lifelong conservative Republican, and the behavior of the right-wing alternative press on this is atrocious,"" he said. ""All of this makes this so much more difficult for this child to recover from this."" * * * July 11 marked the fourth City Council meeting since the Fawnbrook story broke, and once again the case dominated the proceedings. The first speaker was Lance Earl, a Second Amendment activist and local newspaper columnist, who argued that the federal government has no constitutional authority to settle immigrants in Idaho. ""I would like to know why you have not opposed this federal abuse here in Twin Falls,"" he said to the council. Earl was incensed that local police had invited the FBI to investigate threats made against Twin Falls officials, arguing that the involvement of federal law enforcement violates the Constitution. Turning to Kingsbury, seated in the back of the room, he shouted, ""What part of the Constitution allows the federal government to be involved in policing activity inside the states?"" Why, Earl wanted to know, hadn't the City Council demanded Kingsbury's resignation? ""If he is going to violate the Constitution of the United States, he is an empty uniform, and he should not be here,"" he said. The City Council tried to impose a five-minute limit on speakers, but when Earl's time had finished, the next speaker ceded his time so Earl could continue. The city's lawyer was brought in to consult on whether this was allowed; it was ruled that it was not. Nevertheless, Earl spoke for another minute. ""If you people would go back to constitutional principles, the people that would be coming here would be the cream of the crop. They would be coming here to work, and to integrate, and to be American citizens."" The man who'd tried to cede his time then took the microphone and demanded the resignations of every City Council member. Next up was ACT for America's Ruf. She said she was bringing Brigitte Gabriel, ACT for America's founder, to Twin Falls on Aug. 4 and would save front-row seats for everyone on the council. Gabriel is one of the country's most influential anti-Muslim activists; her group claims 280,000 members. She's warned that ""tens of thousands of Islamic militants now reside in America, operating in sleeper cells, attending our colleges and universities, even infiltrating our government."" Ruf argued that the council members have a civic duty to hear her speak. ""Out of respect to the community, I'm asking you to attend the meetings of the people we bring into this community,"" she said. ""And that way at least we know that you're actually trying. You're trying to understand these bizarre people that come from a totally different position than you do."" Then Shane Brown, a tall, broad-shouldered bald man with a goatee, stood up. He said he was born and raised in the Magic Valley, and began talking about his guns. ""I have a shotgun and a rifle, and I buy shells every couple of years because that's all I need to get my limit, fill my tag,"" he said. Recently, though, outsiders have threatened some of his friends in the community. ""And for the first time in my life, I considered and I went and I bought a pistol for protection. There is a group of people that have come into our community, and have infiltrated our community, and have changed it from what I have been born and raised in. These people have brought fear, and anger, and ignorance.""

First she praised her daughter, son-in-law, and grandkids. Then her husband, the rest of her family, and her friends and supporters. Then President Obama, Michelle Obama, and Vice President Joe Biden. Clinton lauded her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine, and the man who had battled her for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders. She praised them all and thanked them for their service. She talked about the American founders and the motto--""out of many, one""--that united them. She called on everyone to work together to improve the country. Donald Trump's speech to the Republican convention was quite different. It took him less than five seconds to begin talking about himself. He went on to tell the audience that ""I am your voice"" and ""I have made billions of dollars in business making deals. Now I'm going to make our country rich again."" Trump insisted that the political system was rigged. ""I alone can fix it,"" he said. This contrast--Trump's ""I"" against Clinton's ""we""--is the fundamental choice in the 2016 election. Until Clinton spoke, I had dismissed her convention theme, ""Stronger Together,"" as a cliche. I don't anymore. It fits the candidates and the moment. Trump wants the election to be a contest between two people. He's the charismatic figure, the entertainer, the brash CEO. Clinton rejects that framework. She's not running against him for the same job. She's challenging his view of what the job is. Her vision of the job--humbler, less autocratic, more collaborative--is better. It's more effective. It's more American. Clinton's approach is a better fit for the challenges of our time. At home, we're divided. Many people are angry about police shootings of black men. Others are alarmed about black men shooting police. There's widespread unrest over wage stagnation. Politicians are blaming immigration. Latinos feel targeted. Trump's answer is a wall, deportations, and a president who imposes ""law and order."" Clinton's answer is a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and rebuilding trust between police and minorities. Her answer is better. It gets people working together toward common goals. It's also a better fit in foreign affairs. Trump, in his address, called for ""Americanism, not globalism."" He wants to renegotiate relationships, suspending commitments to our allies unless we get a better deal. Clinton believes that a strong web of trusting relationships, even if they're favorable to our partners, serves us better than a series of hard bargains. ""We are stronger when we work with our allies,"" Clinton argued. ""I'm proud to stand by our allies in NATO against any threat they face, including Russia."" The ""we"" approach suits Clinton's personality. It reflects what she learned from her mother's childhood--that ""no one gets through life alone""--and the philosophy of good works Clinton was taught in church. It echoes the message of her book, It Takes a Village, and her collaborations with Republicans on legislation to promote adoption and health insurance. Clinton wants global progress toward controlling climate change. No leader can do that alone. The ""I"" approach, conversely, captures what's wrong with Trump. He's a natural antagonist, picking fights with Sen. John McCain, Gov. John Kasich, Megyn Kelly, and others who don't please him. He uses race, ethnicity, and religion to smear people who get in his way. In Atlantic City, New Jersey, Trump ditched investors and contractors to whom he owed money. ""Donald Trump has a passion,"" Kaine observed in his speech to the Democratic convention on Wednesday. ""It's himself."" Nearly three months after the GOP declared him its presumptive nominee, Trump is still bragging about how badly he beat his Republican opponents. A primary that began with a unity pledge dissolved into a convention that most of Trump's rivals refused to attend. The runner-up spoke but refused to endorse the nominee. Meanwhile, a Democratic convention that began with bitterness in the Sanders camp advanced toward unity, thanks in part to Clinton's sympathy and grace. ""We wrote it together,"" Clinton said of the party platform. ""Now let's go out there and make it happen together."" There's a feminine edge in Clinton's emphasis on collaboration. But there's also a muscular reward. The United States is stronger when we listen to one another and work together. ""Donald Trump says--and this is a quote--'I know more about ISIS than the generals do,' "" Clinton said. ""No, Donald, you don't."" She explained that presidents make better military decisions when they take strategic advice. Often, they can leverage more power through economic and diplomatic cooperation than through the unilateral use of force. ""We put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a shot,"" she pointed out. The ""I"" approach looks tough, but it makes the president weak. It fractures the country and our alliances, inviting aggression by Vladimir Putin and other wolves. Trump's ego, Clinton observed, doesn't make him strong. It makes him one of the ""little men, the ones moved by fear and pride."" She concluded: ""A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons."" Trump sees the ""we"" approach as timid and liberal. But Clinton, like Obama, hears echoes of the anti-government message of Ronald Reagan. ""Our founders fought a revolution and wrote a Constitution so America would never be a nation where one person had all the power,"" Clinton warned. Obama, in his speech to the convention, issued a similar rebuke: ""Our power doesn't come from some self-declared savior promising that he alone can restore order as long as we do things his way. We don't look to be ruled."" Framed this way, the election isn't a choice between Trump and Clinton. It's a choice between authoritarianism and self-government, between a man and a team. Clinton can't match Trump's ego, and she doesn't have to. She just has to offer a better alternative. The alternative is a different conception of the presidency, one that's less imperial but gets more done. It's less about the president and more about us. The choice isn't left versus right, or him versus her. It's Trump versus America. Read more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign."
