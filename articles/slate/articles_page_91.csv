It has a slogan that can be seen from the lower end of the stratosphere: ""Faith, Jobs, and Freedom."" The ""faith"" part is sort of new. It comes first for a reason. At the first Wednesday stop, in Council Bluffs, the bus pulls up to the Bayliss Park Hall and parks next to a municipal lamppost decorated with Christmas trimmings. Perry exits the bus with Lt. Dan Moran, a Marine who survived an IED attack in Iraq but sustained third-degree burns. The governor of Texas finds his place in a room of around 85 curious people--a few are from Omaha, a short drive down the road--and gives a 13-minute stump speech. He holds out his arms to ""draw the line between Washington and Wall Street."" He brandishes a postcard to show how simple his flat tax would be and a Sharpie to prove how rarin' and ready he is to start vetoing bills. He doesn't have a prop for his next point. ""This president's had a war on our values,"" says Perry. ""He stopped funding for those Catholic charities simply because they wouldn't perform abortions. Their values are important to them, but this president said, I'm gonna stop the funding to you. His justice department is trying to impact long-standing law that basically says whether or not a church can hire or fire someone because of their values. I mean, think about that. That's an assault on values. That's an assault on religion. And Americans are not going to accept an assault on their values anymore."" Perry passes the microphone to Moran, who has a scar on the back of his head and discolored skin from the operations that saved him. He points to an American flag. ""That flag means something,"" says Moran. ""Our values--they're not just words. We live 'em every day."" Moran says that Rick Perry should be commander-in-chief, because Perry believes that America is exceptional. ""I'll be here,"" the Marine says. ""Even though I can't regulate my body temperature much anymore, if I've got to knock on every door in the union to tell people how important it is to elect Rick Perry president, then I will."" There are audible sniffles and chokes in the room. Perry's video director, Lucas Baiano (the man who made Tim Pawlenty's mind-exploding campaign ads), aims his HD lens at a man in a cowboy hat who's wiping away tears. This campaign stop will help Perry, who has probably benefited from rock-bottom expectations, and who has stabilized at high single digits in the Iowa polls. The voters in Council Bluffs say that they're tired of the media trying to pick a candidate for them. ""How come I turn on TV and I only hear about two candidates?"" asks Denny Smothers, a contractor in Council Bluffs who's wearing a holiday-appropriate green sweater. ""Newt and Mitt, Newt and Mitt. I don't trust them, but I trust Perry."" Perry briefly led Iowa polls before verbal flubs and attacks on his immigration and vaccination policies caused voters to stampede toward other candidates. First Cain, then Gingrich. So, what could Perry offer conservatives that those guys couldn't? Military service, that's one thing. Total religious fidelity--even better. The candidate who soft-launched his presidential campaign with a daylong prayer festival has started praying full time. One week earlier, Perry had debuted a TV ad showing him walking through green fields in a canvas jacket, bemoaning the loss of ""values."" ""You don't need to be in the pew every Sunday to know there's something wrong in this country,"" says Perry in the ad, ""when gays can serve openly in the military but our kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school."" The ad was high-octane parody fuel, a magnet for ""dislikes"" on YouTube. Social conservatives are used to liberals making fun of their beliefs, though. Since the ad ran, voters have been telling pollsters they're warming to the ""oops"" guy. In Council Bluffs, voters tell me they connected with the ""war on values"" message. ""When you can't say 'Merry Christmas' to each other,"" says Fred Miller, who works with the farm bureau in the city, ""that's un-American. Obamacare, that's another example. We don't want to pay for abortions."" How far can Perry get with this? Not far enough to scare rival Republican strategists, not yet. Perry, they say, is just now pushing this message, less than a month before the vote. He's trying to peel off voters who might have ruled him out before--people who are now ready to vote for Rick Santorum or Michele Bachmann, or who are searching for a reason to back Gingrich. But Iowa social conservatives have been fighting a ""war on values"" for years, and Perry wasn't involved with it. Santorum and Gingrich both helped with a 2010 campaign to boot Iowa Supreme Court justices who approved gay marriage. Perry didn't. The ""values"" push looks a little like an exam blue book filled out by a kid who first cracked open the textbook the night before. Why does Perry appear to be cramming? For one thing, he seems bored. He will talk values to any voter he meets, but he doesn't turn on the charm. After Council Bluffs he buses to Harlan, Iowa, taking a guided tour of the center of town, a ring of sleepy small businesses. He comes alive a little when he meets a man who's going to community college. ""You can go to one of those schools and come out making more money than if you go for four years and study philosophy or something,"" jokes Perry. But he doesn't smile much, and he resorts to talking points when a handyman named Bill Rollins says how much he likes his ""values"" ad. ""I can't anymore, you know, change my values, than change how I'm the son of two tenant farmers,"" says Perry. ""It's who I am. It's what I believe. We were talking at the debate, last ... whenever that was. They were asking me about, you know ... do you respect your vows. I said, yeah, very much so."" Rollins likes Perry well enough. Other veterans of the meet-and-greet make sure that I know the governor's handshake is iron-tight. Local pastor Dick Sciranko and his wife Sandra meet him in a clothing shop and like him right away. ""I was watching the American Family Association's show,"" says Sandra. ""They said they knew somebody who said God had called him to run. And I said, if God called him, even if they say in the media he's not a good debater, it don't bother me."" I mention that the loathsome mainstream media said the same thing about George W. Bush.

""Bush didn't put himself forward like Perry does,"" says Dick.

Perry closes out the day in Denison, a short drive up the road. On the way, I hear a radio version of the ""values"" ad with an awkward change. It omits the line ""when gays can serve openly in the military but our kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school,"" separating Perry's dialogue with an audible cut. When Perry speaks at Cronk's restaurant, he uses the same ""war on values"" lines but moves on quickly. It's up to Moran to drive the nail in. ""He's been faithful to his family,"" says Perry's hero surrogate. ""He's been faithful to his country.""

Perry wraps up and shakes hands, and his campaign team mops up with the voters who are still milling around, seeing how willing they'll be to caucus on January. One of the voters, Monte Lapel, hands me an email forward he got the other day, which claims that President Obama held a Muslim day of prayer on Sept. 25, 2009. He printed it out in full color, using the back of a prescription medication info sheet, and scrawled notes on it. ""Can you get this to the right people?"" he asks. ""Can you get this to Gov. Perry. I want to know if it's true. You can put anything on the Internet, right?"""	Does Rick Perry's Faith-and-Values Message Give Him a Chance in Iowa?

I just spent most of a day with these creatures, learning their language of applause and mutual congratulation. By the end, I was shocked: They were on to something. One year ago, when the group No Labels announced itself with an all-day congratulation-fest in New York, Politico's Ben Smith asked whether it was basically a Democratic front group. The only Republicans onstage, he wrote, ""had recently lost primary races."" Its too-cute logo, a Noah's Ark of animals to compete with the donkey and the elephant, was ripped off from an independent designer. Its slogan--""Not Left. Not Right. Forward""-- was ripped off from MSNBC, said Rush Limbaugh. In 2011, political reporters knew No Labels as the guys who sent out ""action"" emails with no actual policy demands. This was odd. While FreedomWorks or MoveOn would call for a phone-melting campaign to pass a bill or block a nominee, No Labels cried only for people to get along. A July 14 email asked supporters to ""call your representative and urge them to continue their work in Washington to find a bipartisan solution."" An Oct. 5 blast about the supercommittee called for politicians to ""put their labels aside and work together for the good of the country."" Repeat, repeat, every few days. But this was before Dec. 13, and the smoothly choreographed launch of an actual No Labels plan. ""Make Congress Work!"" (the exclamation point is theirs) is a list of 12 ideas, crowdsourced over a couple of months and debuted by a panel that included two actual elected Republicans, Rep. Tom Petri of Wisconsin and Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada. There are a few nonclunkers among those 12 ideas. Presidential appointments: Give them up-or-down votes within 90 days. Filibusters: If people are going to do it, make them stand up and empty their lungs out, Jimmy Stewart-style. Both good ideas, both responses to actual legislative crises, both sort of picked up and then fumbled when Democrats had a larger Senate majority. Former Sen. Evan Bayh was milling around, posing for photos and chatting with No Label-ers (this term of art is also theirs). ""We almost got this package of filibuster reforms passed before I left,"" he said, not sounding particularly annoyed that he was now left to reform the body from the outside. ""One of the more senior members of our caucus stood up and said, 'Wait a minute, one day we're going to be in the minority. We're going to want a way to stop them [Republicans] some day.' And I thought to myself, well, if we stop them when we have the majority, and they stop us when they have the majority, we stop each other and the country never moves forward."" Up to now, there had been two knocks on No Labels. The first was Limbaugh's: These guys were Democrats with new clip art. The second, made most recently by writer Mark Schmitt, is that No Labels is a vehicle for ""centrist"" lobbyists to pretend they're not getting what they want. But there's good reason to believe that the Label-istas are being sincere. That's because the big thing they're fighting against--the filibuster--is the tool that makes centrists so powerful. Without it, the House's generous health care bill, with the public option, becomes law. With the filibuster in place, Ben Nelson needs to be bought off with a special Nebraska Medicaid exemption, and Joe Lieberman can demand that a Medicare buy-in be taken out. Hold that up against the work of the other big centrist group, Americans Elect. The knock on No Labels has been that it's amorphous. Americans Elect had an agenda. It would shovel money (don't ask who's donating) over to signature-gatherers, who would get ballot lines in 50 states, which would be hot and ready for a buzzy third-party ticket that would be selected during some kind of online convention. The Americans Elect mission is perfectly engineered to get free media. It's also gooey and pointless. Leave aside all of the reasons why third parties don't win. The big problem is that they have nothing whatsoever to do with the problems that centrists have with Washington. Their problem is that Congress can't do anything, that the incentives for last-minute brinkmanship are always high, and that anyone can stop a bill. In the Americans Elect dream scenario, when a Jon Huntsman/Joe Lieberman ticket takes the White House to demand entitlement cuts and tax hikes, what's to prevent Congress from blocking nominees or throttling legislation? Easy answer: Nothing prevents that. There's dross and silliness in the ""Make Congress Work!"" agenda, too. Joe Lieberman made it to the launch right after a Christian Science Monitor breakfast, where he'd called Americans Elect ""intriguing."" The idea Lieberman floated--prime minister's question time-style rap sessions with the president--had once been broached by John McCain. ""It would give us opportunities to say things we don't say,"" said Lieberman, ""like heya, heya or harrumph harrumph."" Rep. Bruce Braley of Iowa proudly announced that he grew up ""in a No Labels household,"" where he apparently learned to lay on pathos very thick. ""This whole No Labels conference should be dedicated to my friend Gabby Giffords,"" he said. ""If you had been there when she came back to the House, you'd have seen how partisanship melted away, replaced by friendship."" The big idea that came out of the Giffords shooting, the one that made it onto the No Labels 12? Making members of Congress sit next to each other on the House floor. When Braley said that, I remembered the last time I'd been in the room No Labels had booked for the launch--the caucus room of the Cannon House Office Building. It was June 8, when a funfetti combo of right-wing groups launched Cut, Cap, Balance--a pledge to support a debt-limit hike only if it came with spending cuts, a spending cap, and a version of the Balanced Budget Amendment that demanded a supermajority for tax increases. They lost, but only after delaying a compromise on the debt and after getting most GOP presidential candidates to agree to their conditions. That was the antithesis of what No Labels was trying to do. One of the 12 agenda items was a pledge never to sign pledges. But the groups behind Cut, Cap, Balance understood that power doesn't flow out of a presidential campaign. It flows out of boring procedural decisions. Much of the time, activists realize that this stuff is boring, and they try to make bigger splashes with things, like online presidential conventions, that the news cycle can handle. So if 2012 is going to be a year of noisy centrists, it's good to see them sweating the dull, important stuff."	"Is ""No Labels"" the First Centrist Group Ever To Have Good Ideas?"

The inevitable PowerPoint presentation gave the impression of a gathering army and plenty of options. Slides showed that there had been 1 million conversations with voters, 90,000 meetings, and that 45 percent of donors were new ones who had not given in 2008. A screen full of maps showed the five different ways Obama could win the election*, either through a ""Western path"" where he won states such as Colorado, Nevada, and New Mexico, or a ""Florida path."" The collective message was that the Obama team has built something big enough to withstand the deluge of bad data and historical trends that are working against the president: the high unemployment rate, an average approval rating that is seven points below the key benchmark of 50 percent, and a vast majority of voters who think the country is going in the wrong direction. A USA Today/Gallup analysis of swing states that came out this morning showed Republicans are more enthusiastic than Democrats. The president's swing-state poll numbers are worse than they are among the general public. Both Romney and Gingrich lead Obama in those states. President Obama's strategists, of course, had their own numbers showing that Obama was doing better in those states. They quibbled with the USA Today/Gallup findings, prompting one reporter to joke that Susan Page of USA Today, who sat typing on her laptop, should get 30 seconds to respond. The second task of the presentation was to convince us that the Republican nominating fight has become extremely ugly. There has been a lot of talk about which GOP candidate the White House would rather run against. In this briefing, Obama's aides took shots at both Gingrich and Romney, though David Axelrod's characterization of the former speaker was the most colorful. ""Just remember the higher a monkey climbs on a pole,"" Axelrod said, quoting an expression a Chicago Alderman taught him, ""the more you can see his butt. So, you know, the speaker is very high on the pole right now and we'll see how people like the view."" Ultimately the Republican nominee doesn't matter, said the president's men, because the GOP nomination is an ever more extreme contest controlled by the far reaches of the Tea Party. ""They're mortgaging themselves for the general by tacking as far as they are,"" said Axelrod, pointing to hard-line stances against illegal immigrants that will hurt with Hispanic voters and the competition to support a Paul Ryan budget plan that fundamentally changes the nature of Medicare. Candidates have always appealed to their party bases in primaries and successfully courted more ideologically moderate voters in the general, but this time, the Obama team insists, the swing is irrevocable--no going back. They seem to believe that if they can de-legitimize the nominating contest, the winner will gain nothing from victory. They say that the message that the president will carry to victory is the one he outlined last week in Kansas. In it Obama argued for a shared effort to restore national greatness based on the idea that everyone should have a fair shot at the American dream. But this sounds familiar, doesn't it? That's because we've seen this play over and over again from the president. This year alone we were introduced to the new Obama in his September jobs speech, in his April rebuttal to Paul Ryan, and in his January State of the Union address. In December 2010, the president said America faced a ""Sputnik moment."" Last week the president used Teddy Roosevelt as his historical touchstone, and offered the same high stakes, saying American faced ""a make or break moment."" The Obama team pointed out that this is not a new message. Axelrod mentioned Obama's early working history helping those displaced after steel mills shut down, and speeches the president had given in 2004 and 2005, as well as during the 2008 campaign. But this also makes the current promises sound familiar. After each of these speeches, the claim was made that the president had finally taken the field to fight, that his standing would improve because he had thrown off the attempt to make bipartisan deals. ""We were in a position of legislative compromise by necessity. That phase is behind us,"" said Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer in September. The briefing suggested a pretty rough campaign. When Axelrod was asked whether there were any vestiges of hope left over from the 2008 campaign, he said that the focus on fairness was in the same vein: ""It is a hopeful vision of the future of broad prosperity."" But it's hard to see how voters are going to see any hope at all. Polls show that people already have the lowest opinion of government they've ever had. They've heard these promises from President Obama before. Are they going to be more receptive to his message that he can change Washington and make it effective for them when he hasn't been able to for four years? It's all the other guys' fault, the president's team will argue. Perhaps, but the other guys are not going to change even if he's re-elected. Not so, says Axelrod. An Obama re-election will liberate Republicans by showing them the folly of standing with the Tea Party. Once Obama has set them free, they will join with him to tackle the real problems of America. That seems like a stretch, especially if the Obama team is effective in so diminishing the Republican opponent that Republicans can write off the loss as simply the result of a bad nominee, not a fatal flaw in their party's message.

3	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/12/newt_gingrich_is_america_s_greatest_attack_politician_.html	"For a candidate who talks about being nice to his opponents, Newt Gingrich sure knows how to make them suffer. Today, when Mitt Romney suggested Gingrich return the $1.6 million he was paid by Freddie Mac, the former speaker shot back that Romney should return the money he earned ""from bankrupting companies and laying off employees"" as a venture capitalist. When asked about Michele Bachmann's critique of his immigration position, former college professor Gingrich compared her to a dumb student . ""Occasionally I'd have a student who couldn't figure out where things were, or what things were, or what the right date was. When that happens, you feel sorry that they're so factually challenged."" To be fair, these aren't attacks. They're counterattacks, but Gingrich offers them with such ease, speed, and force, it's as if his earlier pledge of restraint was just a way to rope-a-dope his rivals into thinking he wouldn't retaliate. Gingrich's opponents seem sure that attacking him is a smart and necessary strategy, since he's at least 15 points ahead in three of the four first primary contests. But the cumulative effect of these attacks may not be to weaken him but to provide a stage for his fighting side. And showing his eagerness to mix it up may well help him in a year when Republicans are fixated on defeating the incumbent. In Saturday's debate in Iowa, Gingrich's opponents explained why they were in the best position to run against Barack Obama. But while the other candidates talked about being able to take it to Obama, Gingrich showed how he would do it by parrying the attacks. When Romney called Gingrich a career politician, Gingrich shot back that Romney would have been one too if he'd been good enough to beat Ted Kennedy for his Senate seat. Gingrich varies the nature and style of his counterstrikes. He can affect mock astonishment: ""I'm a little surprised that that Gov. Romney's idea of an effective attack is to suggest that breaking your word to raise taxes is a good idea. So you might ask Gov. Romney: Will he agree that you should break your word to raise taxes?"" He can strike back surreptitiously as he did by offering himself as an anonymous source for a Union Leader story, enabling him to hit a Mitt Romney surrogate without appearing to do so. And he can wave away an opponent with the back of his hand. Asked about a Bachmann's snipe against him regarding the individual mandate, he dismissed her by referring to her assertion earlier in the campaign that the Revolutionary War started in Concord, N.H., not Concord, Mass.. ""Have you been in Concord?"" he asked. ""Go to Concord sometime and I'll talk to you later about Mrs. Bachmann."" (Don't fret Mrs. Bachmann, he thinks we're dummies too.) Once the knife is in, Gingrich knows how to twist it. When he suggested Romney return the money he made at Bain, Gingrich bet $10 Romney wouldn't do it, a reference to the $10,000 bet Romney offered to Rick Perry. Gingrich, in fact, is the MacGyver of attack politics, perhaps the most effective and resourceful attacking politician of the modern era. He includes an attack strategy in nearly every policy proposal. When he announced his plan to allow private Social Security accounts, he said he would sell it by using clips from Obama interviews in which the president suggested people might not get their Social Security checks. He taunts the president into debating him. ""He can even use a teleprompter."" Even when he talks about bipartisanship, he does it with an edge of combat. He says to increase energy exploration, Republicans should embrace the Webb-Warner bill, not because cooperation with two Democratic senators is a moral good, but because if Republicans support a Democratic bill, it will force Democrats into voting for policy Republicans want or look cravenly political. On the very day Gingrich was walloping Romney and Bachmann he was proclaiming his virtue in an email to supporters: ""We will not let this campaign devolve into personal attacks, because the American people deserve a debate worthy of the office of President of the United States."" Gingrich often ranks at the bottom of the field when Republican voters are asked who they like--he was sixth in the recent Des Moines Register poll--so no wonder he's so loudly embracing Reagan's 11th commandment: ""Thou shall not speak ill of any fellow Republican."" He's just added the Gingrich codicil: ""... unless they speak ill of you first."""	Newt Gingrich Is America's Greatest Attack Politician
4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/12/how_to_attack_newt_romney_s_urgent_new_effort_to_hit_gingrich_where_it_hurts.html	"Mitt Romney is running for president as a turnaround artist, but before he can turn around the economy he'll have to do something about his campaign. Newt Gingrich has built a huge lead over Romney in various state polls, attracting nearly double the support. Romney had been largely ignoring Gingrich, but now his attack machine is coming on line to define Gingrich as an egomaniac whose fevered brain will hurt conservative causes. (Slate's Jacob Weisberg made a not-dissimilar case.) Romney surrogates including former New Hampshire governor John Sununu and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie opened the attack on Wednesday, while a new Romney ad draws an implicit contrast between Romney's and Gingrich's personal lives. Press releases highlighting the differences between the two candidates on Medicare filled up Thursday morning inboxes. Talking points were issued to allies on Capitol Hill, and the Romney Super PAC started $3.1 million worth of advertisements in Iowa, some of which are likely to attack Gingrich.

You might imagine the Romney attack machine to be smooth black metal with sinister green lights, but when it booted up this week, it was more like a jalopy, starting with a belch and a cloud of black smoke.

Governor Sununu attacked Gingrich over his behavior during the 1990 budget deal in a way that was so helpful to Gingrich it is hard to remember that Sununu is working for Romney. President George H.W. Bush's 1990 budget deal is a signature failure for movement conservatives because Bush agreed to raise taxes. In the tale Sununu told, an agreement was reached and Gingrich, hearing that it included an increase in taxes, said he couldn't support it. He walked out of the White House instead of attending the press event heralding the deal. To some, this might suggest that Gingrich was impetuous and erratic. To conservatives, who are extremely fond of politicians who stick to their principles these days, this looks like a brave stand. It is an episode that shows an insider like Gingrich can claim he was an outsider, fighting for conservative principles against an accommodationist Republican administration. By Thursday morning the Romney machine was working more smoothly. Target: Gingrich's lack of support for House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan's budget and Medicare plan. Gingrich had called the plan ""right-wing social engineering,"" which at the time caused Ryan to say: ""With friends like that, who needs enemies?"" In a conference call with reporters, Sununu characterized the Gingrich's Ryan criticism as ""the most self-serving, anti-conservative thing one can imagine happening."" Senator Jim Talent of Missouri, who was also on the call, argued Gingrich would be a gift to Democrats, allowing them to change the subject from Obama's record. ""If Speaker Gingrich is the candidate, the election is going to be about the Republican nominee, which is exactly what the Democrats want."" Democrats have already used Gingrich once before to define a Republican presidential candidate. In 1996, Bill Clinton tied Bob Dole to Gingrich and campaigned against them as a pair. In 2012, Republican voters will have to decide which candidate makes the better target for Democrats. Gingrich is notorious for his distracting comments and fits of pique, but he also knows how to fight back. Romney's reversals are legendary, and he's not very good at talking his way out of them. The Sununu-Talent pitch was premised on the idea that Gingrich is a threat to conservatism. I asked Talent, who served with Gingrich in the House during the mid-'90s, whether the budget would have been balanced or welfare reformed without the Speaker's leadership.  Talent, who repeatedly said he regretted saying negative things about Gingrich, proceeded to give Gingrich no credit at all. House Republicans did accomplish a lot, but Gingrich's erratic behavior had imperiled future progress. ""You were in a situation where you would get up in the morning, and you would have the to check the newspaper, the clippings, that was before the Internet, to see what the Speaker had said that day that you were going to have to clean up after in your own district."" I asked Talent how Romney's career demonstrated conservative principles. He mentioned Romney's record as governor in Massachusetts in which he limited spending, cut regulations, and turned improved the economy. So here we have another key question for Republican voters to weigh: greater achievement and greater headache with Gingrich--since he truly did make possible the Republican House in the '90s, and the major accomplishments of that Congress--or modest achievement with Romney but less angst and calamity. The other front in the Romney attack was the home front. On Wednesday, the Romney campaign released an ad in Iowa that amounted to a family photo album. It heralded Romney's 42-year marriage over a montage of photographs of Mitt as father. Great ads achieve multiple objectives. This ad helps Romney rebut the charge that he has no core. He's been faithful to his wife for 42 years and his church for longer. It also makes an unspoken contrast to Gingrich, whose commitment to marriage is measured in frequency not longevity. In case anyone was confused, the blunt-speaking New Jersey governor Chris Christie traveled to Iowa and broke the code. Speaking for Romney at a Des Moines event, Christie was asked by an undecided Republican voter to name one thing that distinguished Romney from his opponents.  Christie said he'd watched Romney interact with his children, adding, ""This is a guy who is a father and a husband and loves his wife and his kids. ... When you look at candidates say, 'Is this the kind of person who's always going to make me proud in the Oval Office and never have to worry will embarrass America? That I'll never have to worry will do something that will just make me ashamed?' [Romney] just won't."" Perhaps Romney should be grateful to Gingrich. A time will come when Romney himself will need to stand up and assert with strength what he believes in a way that gives voters the idea that he's willing to fight and scrap for his beliefs--and that he has beliefs strong enough to inspire those actions. That would reveal to them something they haven't seen so far. This collective assault on Gingrich showed a sense of urgency from the hypercautious Romney, a sense of urgency he will need to demonstrate again if he wants to win the presidency."

""We've seen a dramatic transformation in this country,"" said Santorum, ""with Jews all across this country now understanding that the values of the Republican Party are in concert with theirs."" Santorum gave the credit to the RJC. They took it. When 360-odd conference attendees arrived for this day of speeches and briefings, they got info packets reminding them of how the 25-year-old RJC bought ads in Anthony Weiner's old district, successfully convincing Jewish voters to cast an anti-Democrat, anti-Obama vote. They ran into old friends like Frank Gaffney, Daniel Pipes, and I. Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby. They got offered red, white, and blue buttons with the slogan ""Obama ... OY VEY!"" When they put them on, they became targets for teams of reporters hoping to figure out whether Republicans will win the Jewish vote. Short answer: no. Even in the polls that give Republicans hope (like a summer Gallup survey), Barack Obama retains solid majority support from Jews. Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, dropped through the RJC's hermetic seal to assure reporters that this event was a sham. ""Every election, they say that this is going to be the year Republicans win over Jews,"" he said. ""It never happens. What you're seeing here is a very vocal minority."" Some attendees even acknowledged that. ""I think the RJC has a good strategy,"" said Dean Armandroff, who isn't Jewish but who'd come to check out the scene. ""They target the conservative Jews who might vote Republican. Maybe that's only 25 percent, but if Republicans get that, it's a big deal."" So on the surface, Republican presidential candidates were celebrating and predicting a breakthrough year with Jewish voters. One inch below the surface, they were making pitches to the voters and donors they could actually win. The plan, for every candidate, was nearly identical. Find the sharpest adjectives to stab into Barack Obama. Promise the moon to the government of Israel. Agree that Iran was an ""existential threat,"" and explain--or, actually, just sort of muse about--the struggle it would take to defeat them. Santorum got to speak first, and he set the bar in the stratosphere. It was fitting that Republicans were meeting on December 7, he said, because the Obama administration had made all the mistakes that Americans nearly made in the run-up to World War II. They'd engaged in ""appeasement""--a reference to the Munich Agreement that other candidates would repeat all day. ""The United States--I didn't say Israel!--the United States will stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, period,"" Santorum said. With a quick rhetorical twist, he was committing the United States to the first strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. ""The principle virtue of the revolutionary republic of Iran is martyrdom. This is what they hope for, because it will deliver them to their 72 virgins. Mutually assured destruction is not a deterrent to Iran. It is an inducement to Iran."" How should we go about shutting down Iran's nuclear quest? ""We need to say clearly that we will be doing covert activity."" Santorum, perhaps the last Republican candidate who hasn't gotten the requisite anyone-but-Romney poll surge, got long and loud applause. A little bit later, at a luncheon keynoted by Gov. Chris Christie, RJC Chairman David Flaum basically endorsed the Santorum doctrines. ""Your views are so widely held here,"" he said, ""in our hearts and in our minds."" But this wasn't Santorum's crowd. This was a room of wealthy donors who want to win the presidency. They had a candidate: the former governor of Massachusetts, the guy who's raised the most money and has poll leads in swing states when he's pitted against Barack Obama. ""A lot of people here like Newt, too,"" said Ari Fleischer, the former Bush spokesman and current RJC adviser, ""but they're conscious of the other factors that come along with Newt."" Romney had to follow Jon Huntsman, which wasn't hard. The former ambassador to China noted that he had moved up to ""third or fourth in New Hampshire."" As evidence of his bona fides, he said that he considered ""the Israeli ambassador to China one of my very best friends."" It was up to Romney, then, to whack Obama. ""He's publicly proposed that Israel adopt indefensible borders,"" said Romney. (A good and undying trick here: What Obama actually proposed was a two-state solution with territory swapped to make the landmasses equal to the pre-1967 map but with more defensible borders.) ""I will travel to Israel on my first foreign trip. I will reaffirm as a vital national interest Israel's existence as a Jewish state. I want the world to know that the bonds between Israel and the United States are unshakable. I want every country in the region that harbors aggressive designs against Israel to understand that their ambition is futile and that pursuing it will cost them dearly."" This was vague, but it got over. Romney didn't even pick the low-hanging fruit, and go after Ambassador to Belgium Howard Gutman for remarks he made about the roots of anti-Semitism and Muslim anger toward Israel. He may have been chastened by the fact that Gutman's original quote was misreported--something that didn't faze the other candidates. Nobody, actually, seemed bothered by the vagueness, or by how Santorum had gone further than Romney. ""I worked on a lot of stuff with Rick,"" said Norm Coleman, the former senator from Minnesota who now runs the American Action Forum. ""He's talking specifically about projects he worked on. The president can look at things from 30,000 feet."" Newt Gingrich, up next, blended the high and low concepts. ""Frankly,"" he said, ""the ambassador to Belgium should be fired."" It was one in a series of gimmicks. ""On my first day in office, the American embassy [in Israel] would be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem."" This was a pure pander, a wedge issue almost out of nowhere, but it got applause that lifted half the audience off their seats. Gingrich is simply better than Romney at spooning out political viscera. Rick Perry is not as good at this. He spoke to a crowd just slightly diminished from the excitement over Gingrich. He swung at the great ambassador controversy: Our man in Belgium, said Perry, ""blames anti-Semitism among Muslims on Israel's failure to accommodate the Palestinians."" From there, Perry came off as a naif. He isn't. He's been fascinated by Israel for 20 years, since ""I first visited the Holy Land."" But a crowd half concerned with electability and half concerned with smacking Obama didn't need a guided tour of Israel's greatest hits. ""I have been to the Western Wall,"" said Perry, ""that most sacred of symbols where Jewish pilgrims gather to pray today, and that has withstood the assaults on the Jewish people since the times of the early Romans. I walked in the footsteps of the heroes of Masada, a fortress of defiance symbolizing their loyalty to freedom more than life itself."" No danger there of pulling the faithful, electability-conscious voters away from Romney. Perry just added to a consensus. And so did Michele Bachmann, who in senescence was given the last speaking slot of the day. (Ron Paul was explicitly denied a slot; he nursed his wounds by announcing five new campaign offices in later primary states.) Bachmann was hit with the same curse as everyone who has to close out a jamboree: Everything had been said. Somebody else had promised to move the embassy. Somebody else had referred to the ""indefensible borders."" All Bachmann could do was add to the pro-Israel suggestion box. ""I have already secured from a donor to pay for the ambassador's home to be moved to Jerusalem,"" she said. ""So we're good to go! The boxes will be out back."""

Occupy D.C. had been waiting for this one--$1,400 worth of wood, four large sections that would make a sort of church on the grassy, less-occupied south side of the square. The architect, an Occupier named Paul (no last name, thanks), designed it on weekends, and then helped 30 or so protesters raise it. Some nails, some hammers, two hours of work, and presto, Occupy D.C. had a barn, all ready to be covered with plastic and to start hosting ""general assembly"" meetings when the weather got cold. It was a beautiful dream, and it died in a day. The barn would be taken apart and trashed after 31 Occupiers were arrested for refusing to leave it. The last holdout, a protester named David--yes, as in ""and Goliath""--held off the cops as long as he could but was eventually taken to jail after relieving himself on the high-quality roof beams. Paul watched from the penned-off area that gradually filled up with Occupiers, shouting messages of solidarity until police took control of the barn and started scrapping it. ""The police put it in the dump,"" he groaned on Monday. ""They threw it away. It's just so typical. They don't reuse. They don't think. They just have their orders. They don't care about those trees. We put it up in two hours, and we could have taken it down in one hour, saved all of that wood."" It was never going to be easy for a camping-based protest movement to make it through a winter. Cold weather stopped Napoleon, so why wouldn't it stop a bunch of Occupiers? It's possible to occupy a state capitol for a few weeks and get a steady stream of supporters willing to take turns camping. That was what happened 11 months ago in Wisconsin, for a pro-labor movement that quickly moved from protest to politics. But who can stand to stay outside, in tents, for months at a time? Who's going to keep parks occupied for the long haul? The answer: performance artists, and people for whom a few hours of jail and $100 fines are totally worth it if they help promote the cause. These people took command of the barn situation right away. On Saturday morning, around 10:45 a.m., police showed up in the park and asked protesters to take it down. ""We had an impromptu GA [general assembly] and we couldn't come to a consensus,"" remembered Sam Jewler, a member of Occupy D.C.'s media committee. ""There were people who wanted it to come down, people who wanted to sustain it. So we basically decided to have everyone do what they wanted to do, have autonomous action.""* Around 11:30 a.m., police formed a line around the barn and warned that anyone who stayed inside would be subject to arrest. The holdouts, including David and the lion-maned Adrian Parsons--a man who had previously made news for circumcising himself, live, at an art installation--did what came naturally. They occupied. Fifteen people attempted to join in, right as police were closing off the barn area with tape (and later fences). They were arrested. A standoff began, with the barn Occupiers deciding to ""fight"" instead of break down the structure. For the next nine hours, there were two questions in the Occupy-verse. Would police break down the whole camp, thanks to these barn people? And what was going to happen to the folks in the barn? Rumors spread wildly as police cordoned off half the park with tape, creating a zone that only they, their horses, and their vehicles could access. The rest of the Occupiers, joined occasionally by tourists, stood along the fences and police tape, in front of the statue of Gen. James McPherson. ""For the first time,"" shouted Parsons, legs locked onto the roof beams, ""I'm as tall as General McPherson! You all look beautiful."" There was nothing else to talk about. Around 5 p.m., police sent a building inspector into the structure, and one of the holdouts ""mike checked"" the crowd to inform us of a negotiation that might ""keep this here legally."" I wandered over to the Occupy D.C. information tent, where a few veteran campers bemoaned the attention. ""You know what's happening?"" asked Tracy Wall, a middle-aged Occupier who was staying away from the commotion. ""The 1 percent is leading us down the valley. And we're not stopping it. The rest of the 98 percent is going, We're powerless to stop what they're doing."" Wall had just referred to the far edge of the Occupy movement as its own 1 percent. ""I like these people,"" Wall said to me, ""but it makes me crazy. Now, I've got to go back to my tent--I cornered a rat."" Back at the structure, the 16 holdouts claimed that police were rigging the game. Big orange ""danger"" stickers were slapped on the wooden walls. Police tape encircled the structure; one protester ripped off a strip of it, to use as a headband. The holdouts told the crowd that police were negotiating ""in bad faith,"" and they broadcast the name of the officer they were dealing with, Lt. Robert LaChance. The Occupiers' legal observer, Ann Wilcox, told me she was surprised at the ""bad faith"" talk--""I've worked with him for years."" But the tone was set. There was no interest in violence, not even as the Occupiers inside the barn were put under arrest, leaving only the five people who'd climbed on the roof beams. A stocky man jogged around the park asking if anyone else wanted to cross the police barricade with him. ""Come on,"" he sighed. ""Nobody?"" No, nobody. Instead, the supporters in the free zone ""mike checked"" the First Amendment and the police code of honor. ""This is for you!"" they shouted at the officers in front of the barn. The officers stayed expressionless behind shielded helmets. As it grew darker, they got the tools they needed to remove the protesters--a cherry picker, an armored car, a giant inflatable cushion in case anyone wanted to jump off. ""This is ridiculous,"" said a supporter named Asantewaa Nkruma-Ture, who gawked at the showdown from on top a park bench. ""There are dilapidated houses where people have wanted building inspectors to come for years. They keep calling, no one comes. This house goes up, and they're here the same day!"" The standoff was ending. It was just taking a while to end. The fact that the holdouts were performers with nothing to lose was going to keep it dragging. One Occupier taunted police, jumping down to the armored car, shaking his booty, and scrambling back out of reach. VIDEO HERE It couldn't last. The booty-shaker eventually gave in and jumped on the air mattress, which on Twitter had become known as the ""First Amendment moon bounce."" The others slowly followed. It ended with David and his stream of urine. Admittedly, a thing like that can overwhelm the message of a big protest. So what was the message? By refusing to remove a quick-build barn in the middle of a D.C. park, what had the Occupiers proved? ""It brought a lot of attention to the movement,"" said Paul, the distraught architect. ""It was symbolic of what happens in a country where they're kicking people out of homes, putting people in jail, when they should be arresting the people kicking them out."" *Correction Dec. 6, 2011: This article originally misquoted Sam Jewler. He referred to ""autonomous action,"" not ""anonymous action."""	Occupy D.C. Raises a Barn, Cops Tear it Down
7	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/11/newt_gingrich_is_the_only_candidate_who_knows_how_he_would_govern_america.html	"When a presidential candidate makes a promise, it's always useful to ask: How are you going to pull that off? There usually isn't an answer. Health care will be repealed, the budget balanced, and 15-minute brownies made in 10. Newt Gingrich is the only candidate who talks about how he would actually enact some of the promises he makes and the changes he would bring to the office of the presidency. Whether you agree with him or not, this is a useful and laudable thing. Candidates should be able to show that they have some concept of how to engage the massively complex organization they hope to take hold of. This would tell us something about them, and force those of us casting votes to be more realistic about what presidents can accomplish. Gingrich, for his part, has shown that he is occasionally willing to be a realist even when it gets him in trouble with his own party. On the issue of illegal immigration he has made the obvious point that the government does not have the resources to round up 11 million illegal immigrants, and, perhaps more important, from a moral standpoint it is unlikely Americans would support deporting model citizens who have lived in their communities for 25 years. In May, Gingrich criticized Rep. Paul Ryan's budget plan as ""right-wing social engineering"" that was too aggressive to win the support of the public. ""If you're dealing with something as big as Medicare and you can't have a conversation with the country where the country thinks what you're doing is the right thing, you better slow down,"" he said in the first Republican presidential debate. The gap between the promise and the plan for making it happen is widest in the campaigns of Herman Cain and Ron Paul. Cain sounds like he's thought about the process of leading when he talks about identifying the right problem and working on it, but his 9-9-9 plan would redesign the tax code essentially on the strength of his personality. All other complexities of governing would be decided by smart advisers. Paul offers even more radical change than Cain with essentially the same promise--that he'll just make it happen. Unlike Cain, Paul can actually point to his campaign's organizational successes in support of his argument. If only the world were as easy to organize as a GOP straw poll. When Gingrich brags about the profound change he's going to bring as president, he joins a long line of boring politicians promising bold change. But where he differs from the others is that he shows that in small and large ways that he's thought through just what big change requires. He doesn't ask his audiences to vote for him but rather to ""stand with me."" ""If you vote for me you're going to vote and go home and think Newt will fix it,"" he says. Change, he argues, comes only through an entirely new kind of citizenship where people become actively involved in their government again. In his new Contract With America, the third item is a training program for executive branch employees. ""You can't just appoint smart people. You have to have a team and operate as a team, and any corporation would have a training program to acculturate people."" Every president faces the problem of groupthink. Candidates sometimes promise they'll seek outside counsel. Gingrich proposes a networked ""feedback mechanism"" where supporters ""can go online and say that say, 'That didn't work,' or a mechanism for you to say, 'Try this' if you find something smarter or if the world changes and there's a new problem, the sooner we talk to each other the better."" Last week when Gingrich unveiled his Social Security plan for allowing younger workers to invest in the stock market, he offered a strategy for getting it passed. ""I wouldn't make it my program,"" he said, explaining why he would succeed where George W. Bush failed. ""You can't come out of an election that is bitterly divided and put your name on a program and think any Democrat is going to vote for it. And I'm not going to go around the country trying to sell it. I'd get hundreds of thousands of young people through social media to decide it's their program."" (In some narrow minds this would be called ""leading from behind."") There are some challenges to all of this nifty thinking about the structures to convey change. It could all be hokum. Gingrich sometimes sounds like that childhood friend who launched a thousand plays, soapbox derbies, and fort-building projects but never completed any of them. Or, he might not get the other kids to play along. People may not want to be engaged citizens all the time. They've got busy lives to lead. Training of administrative aides might wind up being as useless as lots of corporate training sessions. But Gingrich does have his successes, chief among them the 1994 Republican victory that made him speaker. As speaker, he helped balance the budget and reform welfare. But there was also a cost. Gingrich burned out his colleagues. Today he says he pushed too much. Back then, he called them cannibals. The other challenge for Gingrich is that his flurry of new proposals and notions bound off in so many directions that they may overwhelm even the fine-tuned Gingrich executive office of the presidency. You can strengthen the hull of your ship and get a really good navigation system, but if you go over Niagara Falls, it's not going to matter."	Gingrich Is the Only Candidate Who Talks About How He Would Govern the Country
8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/11/barney_frank_retires_why_the_democrats_will_miss_his_voice_.html	"Politicians like to use retirement speeches to criticize the systems that have so disappointed them. Rep. Barney Frank embraced that tradition on Monday with his copyrighted mix of derision and bluntness. ""People on the left and people on the right live in parallel universes,"" he mused. ""No longer do people get their information from a common media source, and then diverge in how they interpret it. The left is on MSNBC and on the blogs. The right is on Fox and on talk radio. And what happens is, people know different facts. These are echo chambers. People hear agreement with themselves."" The point he was trying to make: Voters needed to share some of the blame for how lousy their government had become. They hustled moderates out of office, and they demanded crazy things of people like Frank. Still: sad denunciations of our polarized media? Really? Didn't Evan Bayh cover that when he retired? It was strange to hear Frank tooting from that bugle. Polarized media and political debate has generally been better for Republicans than it's been for Democrats. One exception was Barney Frank. No liberal politician--none who had to face voters every two years--was so at home in the culture wars. Frank's policy legacy, as his friends said all day Monday, will rest on two pieces of legislation that voters either loathe, misunderstand, or loathingly misunderstand. He headed the House Financial Services committee for four years. He helped craft the Troubled Asset Relief Program (there were grousers who said the first version of it failed the House because Frank didn't demand enough controls), and he won the agonizing battle for post-collapse Wall Street reform. The first bill was the animus for the greatest conservative voter rebellion in 30 years. The second, according to nervous Democrats, is in serious danger from Republicans who pledge to undo it if they romp in 2012. One reason for the angst is that Frank is--sorry again, was--so good at explaining what he was trying to do. Any critic or journalist who challenged Frank would soon learn that he was stupid, that he wasn't listening, or that he had foolishly failed to consider one of a thousand or so other facts that Frank had memorized. While Frank was making his Monday announcement, reporters were swapping stories of the times Frank had first shut them down for being imbeciles. Mine was in January, when I tried to follow up something Frank had said about the impossibility of gun control even after the assassination attempt on Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. ""Don't argue with me,"" he said. ""I'm telling you what they say, and you're going to give me a logical argument for it?"" If I'd written Frank an angry letter, I might have gotten the response he once sent to a crank in his district: ""I'm surprised to find absence of explicit anti-Semitism this time. Was a page missing?"" This was how Frank talked. Other liberals may have been comfortable having friendly tiffs like this. But Frank was atypically comfortable getting into these sorts of spats over cultural issues. The culture wars were designed by conservatives so that conservatives would always win. Frank simply didn't care if most Americans agreed with the conservative position on religion, gay rights, abortion, or drug laws. In 1984, when he was in his second term and presiding over early morning speeches, Frank got irritated when Rep. Marjorie Holt, R-Md., pined for America to rediscover its identity as a ""Christian nation."" ""If this is a Christian nation,"" said Frank, ""how come some poor Jew has to get up at 5:30 in the morning to preside over the House of Representatives?"" Even after Holt retracted the comment--really, the kind of comment made 100 times a day on campaign trails--Frank dug in. ""I've never met a Judeo-Christian,"" he snarked. ""What do they look like? What kind of card do you send them in December?"" A reporter asked him to explain himself further. ""I have no objection to Christians being more Christian,"" he said. ""I object to them making America more Christian."" There's no upside to talking like this, at least in national politics. Frank turned this around. He talked about morality the way that conservatives talked about it. He was obviously right; the other side was full of hypocrites and morons. In the 1996 debate over the Defense of Marriage Act, which came without much warning, Frank mocked Republicans for fearing that some marriage-destroying power could jump from host to host like a virus. ""How does the fact that I love another man and live in a committed relationship with him threaten your marriage?"" asked Frank in floor debate. ""Are your relations with your spouses of such fragility that the fact I have a committed, loving relationship with another man jeopardizes them?"" The other side was always wrong, always misinformed, probably nuts. In 2009 and 2010, when other Democrats were enfeebled by unexpected Tea Party attacks, Frank would shut down anyone who challenged him in public. In 2009 a Harvard Law student named Joel Pollak asked Frank if he deserved some blame for the financial crisis, and Frank derided him for indulging a ""right-wing attack."" Pollak would go on to run for Congress himself in Illinois, and lose, but he didn't claim to have out-debated Frank. ""What separates Barney Frank from other left-wing ideologues is that his posture of intellectual superiority rises to the level of genuine conviction,"" said Pollak in an email. (He's now the editor of Andrew Breitbart's ""Big"" blogs.) ""In a pinch, he can batter his opponents with encyclopedic details about historical events and legislative minutiae. He's an 'intellectual bully,' though there's often no insight in his insults, just evasion and question-begging."" There's a lot of that in political debate, though. What's lacking are liberals who are good at it. ""His humor works because he seems naturally funny and off the cuff,"" said Sam Seder, a former Air America host and roving TV pundit who booked Frank when he could. ""I think his entire appeal as a guest comes from his not seeming to try too hard."" It doesn't sound hard, but it is. You can now choose your own media, your own political news, and your own facts. Nobody's going to break into your silo unless he's loud, and he can explain why you're so stupid."	How Barney Frank Won--Or At Least Didn't Always Lose--the Culture Wars
9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/11/pontiac_mich_can_a_technocrat_succeed_where_democracy_failed_.html	"PONTIAC, Mich.--To get to city hall, you drive up I-75, past the empty Silverdome where the Detroit Lions used to play, and into a nondescript concrete municipal building. The city clerk was laid off a few days ago, but the door to her office hangs open. The mayor, Leon Jukowski, gives me a brief tour of the desks where people no longer work. Cubicles sit empty, little tchotkes and calendars left behind when their owners were laid off. ""At one time we had 800, 900 city employees,"" says Jukowski. ""We have 150 now. And we have the same services that we always had."" The unemployment rate in Pontiac is pegged at 25 percent. In 2009, as GM restructured under a government bailout, it shuttered its plant in Pontiac and ceased production on the line of cars named after the city, calling it a ""damaged brand."" So what happens to the people that the city lays off? ""Some of them go on unemployment,"" says Jukowski. ""Some of them, like the police, keep their jobs because they merge with the county. Most of them are out on the street. In a city of 59,000, the issue of city jobs going away isn't the major break[ing point]. It doesn't help. But we're a town that used to have an automotive industry. We had more money coming in than we knew what to do with, so we didn't really have to be real serious about city government. People began to view city government as a job creator; a jobs bank, if you will. We tended to look at development projects, city government, everything as an opportunity to put local people to work, instead of as an opportunity to create infrastructure, provide services."" The short tour ends at the office of Jukowski's boss. Jukowski, elected in 2009, does not run the city of Pontiac. That is the job of the ""emergency manager,"" a state-appointed technocrat who has the power to do basically anything he needs to if it'll set the city right. Under this system, the City Council isn't paid. Jukowski is paid as a consultant--$30,000 a year for a job that used to pay six figures--answering to Emergency Manager Louis Schimmel. He was a fellow at the Mackinac Center, Michigan's free-market think tank; the mayor is a Democrat. Jukowski is fine with this. ""I ran,"" he says, ""because I just got sick and tired of watching the city go sideways."" If you don't feel like sugar-coating it, the emergency manager--Pontiac is one of three Michigan cities currently run by one--is an admission that democracy occasionally doesn't work. Michigan introduced an emergency ""financial"" manager law in 1990, as a way to straitjacket cities that were failing. Schimmel made his reputation running turnarounds in the small, benighted cities limning Detroit. He succeeded, largely, but he was frustrated by limits. ""When I was running Hamtramck, for example, the unions could drag me out for years,"" says Schimmel. ""They'd say, 'We don't have to settle with you.' And they didn't. They could delay and delay--they could schedule meetings then cancel them as they were about to start. They could take me to arbitration. I had to spend a lot of time dealing with union contracts."" That changed this year. Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, and a GOP legislature passed Public Act Four, which changed the ""emergency financial manager"" to an ""emergency manager,"" giving him a slew of new powers. He can ""terminate 1 or more terms and conditions of an existing collective bargaining agreement."" He can ""make, approve, or disapprove any appropriation, contract, expenditure, or loan, the creation of any new position."" The changes track closely the recommendations of a report on reforming the ""emergency managers"" law, published by Mackinac in January 2011, co-authored by one Louis Schimmel. Schimmel arrived in October, estimated the budget deficit at $12.5 million, released his plan, and announced his targets--pensions, public services. ""The City,"" he wrote in the plan, ""has engaged in activities and made promises that the City did not have the ability to properly manage or financially support."" So the police department was given over to Oakland County. Schimmel just ignored the community-activist protests over that one. If everything pans out, the fire department will be paired up with that of neighboring Waterford's, flattening out the costs. The law department was shuttered. The shrinking number of public employees are going to get smaller benefits. Pontiac was ready for this, sort of. It had been run by the old sort of emergency czar since 2009. There was Fred Leeb, who didn't have expansive powers, then a roving turnaround experiment named Michael Stampfler. Leeb says he was on the right track and was doing better in Pontiac than the new guys are doing. ""The new emergency manager's trying to portray Pontiac as this god-forsaken city that's hopeless,"" says Leeb. ""You can't cut your way to success, and you can't tax people to death when they don't have means."" Schimmel laughs at the sour grapes. ""I hear that critique: What are you doing about community development? My answer is this is not an attractive town to come to because it's a financial disaster. If you want to develop here, at least now you're not coming into a town that's a chaotic mess."" I took that debate to some locals on the city's main street. It's busier since the city realized it was losing money by trying to collect parking fees and ripped out the parking meters. ""The last guy wanted to run everything himself, and you couldn't get a meeting with him,"" says Maureen Young, co-owner of Bo's Smokehouse, referring to Stampfler. ""Lou's local--he's from Pontiac--and he gets it."" The way they tell it, working with an emergency manager who has no limits on power is a dream. ""The last bunch we elected didn't do anything,"" says Young. ""Personally, I like city managers. They're educated not so much in city politics as in government."" Kyle Westberg, who co-owns a construction company, recalls how the first meeting between Schimmel and the downtown business association went. ""We met with him and brought up some of our concepts of economic development,"" says Westberg. ""He stopped us, and said, 'Right-sizing the city, that's how we bring back business.' Well, that's not what we want to do. But we brought up the Strand, an old theater that's almost been rehabbed, and the idea of sharing it with the county. He said, 'Done.' It was that simple."" There are critics, including much of the City Council, local activists, and nationally known progressives like Michael Moore. A government that cuts at one manager's discretion, with no voter accountability until his plan is implemented, is ""a power grab to disenfranchise voters,"" if you ask one of the attorneys on the other side. The stakes are high, because the Schimmel/Pontiac model is poised to be copied in larger cities. Last week, political leaders in Flint declined to challenge the state's decision to assign an emergency manager. This week, Snyder said he'd decide shortly whether to open an inquiry into Detroit, which may run out of money in six months. The Motor City could be taken over by an autocratic wonk. The critics could end up stopping these takeovers. Act Four has galvanized Michigan progressives and unions, and a movement to repeal the act by initiative claims that it has enough signatures to start the process. If they do, the law could be paused until voters decide on it. It's all so predictable, says Jukowski. ""You're not going to have the political class coming up and saying, 'Oh thank you for removing my authority over our police department,' "" he says. "" 'Thank you for making it impossible for me to place my relatives in positions in city hall.' There's this dichotomy of a political class saying, 'You know, this is horrible, this is a travesty, this is the worst thing that could ever happen, they're violating our right to vote, etc.' But the man on the street is saying, 'You know what?

At the CNN national security debate on Tuesday, the former speaker said that he would not be in favor of kicking out illegal immigrant families that had been in the country for a long time. ""The party that says it's the party of the family is going to adopt an immigration policy which destroys families that have been here a quarter century?"" he said. ""I'm prepared to take the heat for saying, 'Let's be humane in enforcing the law.' "" Michele Bachmann said Gingrich was offering amnesty. Mitt Romney said Gingrich was offering a ""magnet"" that would encourage more illegal immigration. A similar moment almost exactly two months ago started Rick Perry's downfall. He said those who didn't agree with his in-state tuition program for the children of undocumented workers were ""heartless."" In 2008 it was John McCain's support for something conservatives called amnesty that almost killed his campaign. Whether Gingrich is thrown over the side for his views on immigration will tell us where we are in the Republican nominating race. If he is jettisoned--for this and not the many other reasons--it will mean that conservatives are still looking for the (nonexistent) perfect candidate: One slip up and you're gone, because we've got a hangar full of gleaming models to choose from. If Gingrich does weather this moment, it will mean that the Republican presidential campaign is moving to that inevitable stage at which voters recognize that all candidates are flawed but some are less flawed than others, or have attributes that outweigh their flaws. After the debate, Gingrich stuck to his position on immigration, the broader shape of which is based on a ""red card"" program put forward by the Krieble Foundation. ""Millions will go home,"" he said after the debate, ""but there will be millions who will be staying."" He said no one should kid themselves about the unworkability of deporting 11 million people. He also made his case on the grounds of simple human kindness. This, almost exactly, was Ronald Reagan's position. In a 1984 debate with Walter Mondale, the Republican icon said: ""I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and lived here, even though sometime back they may have entered illegally."" Will this hurt the Republican co-front-runner? Maybe not. There aren't any other candidates left in that closet of Romney alternatives. Voters can't flee to somewhere else. Unlike Perry, who allowed his ""heartless"" remark to define him, Gingrich is already well-defined as a conservative warrior of long standing. He has other qualities and attributes people know about to help Febreze a momentary rotten egg. On the other hand, this might remind people why Gingrich might not be a safe bet: He has a lot of ideas, and when he thinks he's right, there's no persuading him. This is where Gingrich's imperial tone--which served him well earlier in the debate when he was exhorting his comrades to ""break out of the current mindless bureaucracy of this city"" and return to ""core issues""--might work against him. Overall, Gingrich hit the GOP sweet spot just as he has in other debates. He had punchy, detailed answers on everything from Social Security reform to the Patriot Act. ""I don't want a law that says after we lose a major American city, we're sure going to come and find you. I want a law that says, 'You try to take out an American city, we're going to stop you,'"" he said, to great applause. Romney, meanwhile, had a perfectly fine night. He was competent and avoided hurting himself or letting any other candidate hurt him. He returned frequently to his anti-Obama talking points and the necessity of American strength. He clashed with Jon Huntsman over the pace of withdrawal in Afghanistan, becoming a little more heated than the moment required (which hinted either at personal animus between the two or a bad pre-show burrito). And when Ron Paul said Congress would never cut the defense budget, Romney rolled his eyes up into his hairline, rattling off a host of weapons systems that were on the chopping block. In answer after answer he had figures and details at the ready, at one point citing the need to reach out to the Alawites in Syria. In one odd moment during the immigration debate, Romney seemed to be criticizing Gingrich's plan to allow longtime but undocumented families with ties to the community to stay in the country. Pressed by moderator Wolf Blizer (""Blitz,"" as Herman Cain called him), Romney said, ""I'm not going to start drawing lines here about who gets to stay and who gets to go."" But that seemed to be exactly what he was doing in his critique of Gingrich moments before. Bachmann argued for continuing aid to Pakistan, saying the country was ""too nuclear too fail,"" (a line she cribbed from a quote in Jeffrey Goldberg and Marc Ambinder's great Atlantic piece on the country). She faced off with Perry, as she did in the last debate, calling his Pakistan policy ""hugely naive."" Bachmann, a member of the House Select Intelligence Committee, has done better in the last two debates on the specifics of foreign policy than she has on domestic issues in the previous debates. By contrast, Cain and Perry were so tentative on most answers it almost seemed as if they were Googling the questions as they were being asked. The debate probably didn't change the shape of the Republican race too much, though it will take a while to measure the fallout from Gingrich's remarks on immigration. Throughout his rise in the polls, Gingrich, who fancies himself a bit of a futurist, has predicted that a moment might come when he says something that dooms his campaign. We'll know in a week or so whether he called it this time."	"Who's More ""Pro-Family"": Newt Gingrich or Michele Bachmann?"
11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/11/supercommittee_and_bush_tax_cuts_a_10_year_old_blunder_doomed_deficit_reduction.html	"The death of the supercommittee was announced, in classic Washington fashion, by two lung-emptying interviews on Meet the Press. Sen. Jon Kyl, the debacle's senior Republican, bemoaned Democrats for being ""unable to cut even $1 in spending without saying it has to be accompanied by tax increases."" Meanwhile, the thwarted Republican heroes of the committee had proposed a plan under which ""the wealthiest Americans would pay more taxes than they do now."" It was left to Sen. John Kerry, the committee Democrat who'd staked the most on a deal, to put Kyl's words through the shredder. By saying people would pay more taxes than they do now, Kyl was only affirming that Republicans wanted to make the Bush tax cuts permanent, then start tinkering. The tax cut deal of 2010 only extended the Bush rates to January 2013. Republicans wanted to rewrite the deal, extend the rates forever, and add an estimated $2 trillion to the debt in exchange for a smaller number of revenue-raisers and loophole-busters. The ""most significant block to our doing something right now, tomorrow,"" said Kerry, ""is their insistence, insistence, insistence on the Grover Norquist pledge and extending the Bush tax cuts. Now, we are not a tax-cutting committee. We're a deficit-reduction committee."" By failing, the supercommittee will still have reduced the deficit. (It leaves the current tax code, including the expiration of the Bush tax cuts, in place, and it will result in automatic spending cuts unless Congress decides it won't.) But it could have done more. The Bush tax cuts cut the top marginal tax rate by 4.6 percentage points and the other rates by 3 points. They were passed 10 years ago, were all set to expire 11 months ago, were extended by a glum President Obama, and--this is probably the important part--made it impossible to shrink the deficit or fix the tax code. By extension, they prevented Democrats from giving in and reforming entitlements. That's not the pathetic part. The pathetic part is that all of this was predictable when the tax cuts were passed 10 years ago. There were plans that would have prevented us from getting locked in to tax rates too low to fund a country heading into an entitlement crunch. The plans were rejected. They were sold as a stimulus, as a solution to a unique problem--high surpluses--that soon evaporated. Ten years later, the supercommittee was trapped by a tax policy that stopped making sense within a year of being passed. This story begins in January 2001, at the beginning of George W. Bush's presidency. He'd promised to enact a $1.3 trillion tax cut. (The number had increased during the campaign.) He took office with wan Republican majorities in favor of tax cuts--with conditions. His treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, and his inherited Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, had conditions, too. On Jan. 5, 2001, the two men met and agreed on a way to cut taxes without risking huge deficits. They would back them, but suggest ""triggers"" that canceled them out if the surpluses melted way. ""A good enough idea,"" said O'Neill, ""if it can be sold."" It wasn't sold. For starters, the Bush administration didn't want the triggers. Republicans running the House and Senate budget committees didn't want them, either. The coup de grace was Greenspan's Jan. 25 testimony on the tax plan. When Greenspan gave the remarks to Sen. Kent Conrad, the ranking member of the committee, the Democrat warned him that he'd ""unleash the deficit dogs,"" and ""all those who want more tax cuts will see this as confirmation that they're right."" Former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin gave him the same advice. Greenspan gave his testimony. The ""trigger"" stuff made it in there, albeit in murky Greenspanese. He floated a ""phased in"" tax plan that ""would limit surplus-reducing actions if specified targets for the budget surplus and federal debt were not satisfied."" He had to: ""What if, for example, the forces driving the surge in tax revenues in recent years begin to dissipate or reverse in ways that we do not now foresee?"" Almost nobody noticed. The headline was the Maestro of the Markets backing tax cuts, not any of the nuance. ""It turned out that Conrad and Rubin were right,"" Greenspan wrote in his memoirs. ""The tax-cut testimony proved to be politically explosive."" When I brought up this comedy of errors to Conrad, he remembered--without much joy--that Greenspan told him he ""wished he'd followed my advice."" ""I supported a trigger, because it was better than the tax cuts with no trigger,"" said Conrad. ""It was rejected by those who insisted on the whole enchilada."" Had the triggers been put in place, the events of 2001 would have started taking the tax cuts apart. Instead, the tax cuts went into effect just as the government spent more money on emergencies. In 2002, the deficit returned at $159 billion. Bush OMB director Mitch Daniels told the nation to relax; ""the unexpected surge in revenues toward the end of the last decade was temporary, and that revenues are returning to historic levels for reasons unrelated to legislated change."" In 2003, the deficit grew to $374 billion. That was the year that the Iraq war began, and it was the year that Republicans, back in control of the entire Congress, passed a new tax cut package that accelerated the changes of 2001. Democrats seemed to have an out. Sure, the Bush rates were incompatible with the costs of war and the welfare state. They would also expire on Jan. 1, 2011, a timeline that reflected the limits of long-term budgeting and made the tax cuts look less costly. They wouldn't bind a hypothetical future Congress. They'd just bet on the tax cuts being hard to undo. ""The idea,"" said former Majority Leader Dick Armey--now chairman of the Tea Party group FreedomWorks--""was to get the best we could for the longest we could."" But some Democrats realized that the tax cuts would be hard to kill. ""If you look at most expiring tax cuts, they get renewed,"" said John Spratt, formerly the top House Democrat on budget issues, who was defeated in 2010. ""I knew if the taxes would expire, someone would eventually say it would hammer the economy, regardless of the condition of the economy. If it was good, it would weaken us. If it was bad, it would exacerbate the problem."" The 2010 tax extension fight went as Spratt and the rest of them expected. The supercommittee fight was a little more surprising to Democrats. Kerry wasn't the only one distraught that Republicans wanted to move the goalposts, yet again, to make the Bush tax rates permanent or make them the basis of tax reform. Hadn't the last decade proved that it wouldn't work? Didn't S&P say specifically that its downgrade decision had a lot to do with fear that obstinate Republicans would refuse to let the Bush tax cuts expire? Sure it did. Yet Republicans had kept the Bush tax cuts alive and unmolested through two wars and an expiration date through sheer stubbornness. They've made a series of winning bets. One: They'll have political clout to revive the tax cuts when the time comes. Two: There'll be no move away from their mantra that ""we have a spending problem, not a revenue problem."" Three: Having got the best possible tax deal in 2001, they can wait to reform the system when they control all the levers of power. ""There's a low tax, tax reform committee ready, kind of biding their time,"" theorized Dick Armey. ""There's a high confidence that we will have a conservative majority of the majority in the House, a conservative majority in the Senate, and a conservative in the White House. And then we'll have people with whom we can work."""	Why Did the Supercommittee Fail? Blame George W. Bush.

13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/11/can_gingrich_last_as_the_republicans_latest_non_romney_candidate_.html	"Being the non-Mitt Romney candidate in the Republican field is like being the No. 3 leader of al-Qaida: You don't keep the job for long. Newt Gingrich's rise starts a Doomsday clock, which counts down the minutes from the time a campaign begins to rise until it collapses. This unscientific number is based on the flameout rate of Romney's opponents. According to the RealClearPolitics poll averages, it took two months from when Michele Bachmann started her rise to when she started to fall. That was about the same amount of time it took for Herman Cain (though his zoom back to earth is still ongoing and presumably could reverse). For Rick Perry, it took three months for the turnaround. Gingrich's climb started two months ago, which means he's already passed the expiration date of two of his rivals. His ascent has been slower, but he has a month to go before setting a record for longevity. The first challenge to Gingrich's health came in a Bloomberg report that Freddie Mac paid him $1.5 million over eight years, including a monthly retainer of $25,000 to $30,000 for three years. Gingrich says he provided strategic advice and acted as a historian. He says he told Freddie Mac its lending guidelines were ""insane,"" but, like debate moderators, they didn't listen. If Freddie Mac paid anyone other than Gingrich that much for so little, the former speaker would use it as proof of Freddie Mac's stupidity. Instead, the relationship offers a window into Gingrich's wilderness years, after he resigned from Congress but still had valuable establishment credentials and Washington experience. He is now running at the top of the nominating race of a party where those two qualities were once thought disqualifying. Sources familiar with Gingrich's contract with Freddie Mac, as well as press accounts over the years, paint a different picture of Gingrich's involvement. He was hired, they say, to make the case for the Freddie Mac business model just as conservatives were criticizing it. This isn't lobbying in the sense that Gingrich asked anyone to support a specific bill. But it is common practice in Washington for enterprises like Freddie Mac (and Fannie Mae, which hired Gingrich's former chief of staff) to keep people from Capitol Hill or the White House around, even on a monthly retainer: You never know when they might come in handy. Gingrich's title of historian seems to be a self-appointed and recent one. Later in the day Gingrich explained to radio host Laura Ingraham that even if he didn't do the button-holing himself, he helped Freddie Mac's efforts. ""I may have offered advice on what they could do ... if I were you I would go do this ... these are the guys you ought to go talk to, and these are the things you could talk about."" The association is problematic because Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which have long been unpopular among conservatives, have become a central target of anti-government anger after the housing crisis. The challenge for Gingrich goes beyond demonstrating that he was not a lobbyist. He has to show he was not a part of a cozy system in which a malevolent force uses the power of a former speaker to protect its special-interest status. Michele Bachmann was the first of Gingrich's rivals to hit this theme: ""While he was taking that money, I was fighting against Fannie and Freddie."" (Bachmann was, however, taking campaign donations.) In a brief press conference Wednesday, Gingrich explained that the episode shows why he should be president. ""It reminds people that I know a great deal about Washington and if you want to change Washington, we just tried four years of amateur ignorance and it didn't work very well, so having somebody who knows Washington might be a really good thing."" It was about time that someone defended the benefits of political experience, if for no other reason than to reset the balance. There has been a little too much unqualified praise for complete ignorance of Washington. But if the GOP buys the Gingrich line it will be quite a change: Gingrich, with his Washington experience and insider know-how, will replace Herman Cain, whose success was founded on the idea that he had neither of those qualities. The question for voters is whether Gingrich's experience is what they want. His record as a leader in Washington is about to get a thorough airing. He achieved a lot but he also broke some furniture and created a lot of enemies, many of them in his own party. If the Republican contest comes down to a battle between Gingrich's management experience in Washington and Romney's management experience in business, it may be a hard sell for Gingrich. On the other hand, maybe Gingrich can argue that he is both an experienced Washington hand and an outsider who challenges the ways of Washington. It's an argument uniquely suited to a former speaker who was run out of town."	Why Newt Gingrich May Be the Most Unlikely Non-Romney Candidate Yet

Fundamentally stupid, frankly. It might be the biggest abomination since Chamberlain's appeasement. That's the way the former speaker sees most things. Talk of tax increases is ""maniacally stupid,"" he said in Iowa today, where he also called the deficit supercommittee ""one of the dumbest things"" he's ever seen in Washington. In the (10 and counting) Republican presidential debates, Gingrich has routinely treated the moderators the way Oliver was treated when he asked for a second bowl of mush. This is all in character for a man who built his career in part by dismantling opponents of both parties. He didn't just do battle with Democrats--he dethroned their leader, Jim Wright. Among his own party, Gingrich also criticized those lawmakers he considered too accommodating of the other side, such as then-House Minority Leader Bob Michel. When he was speaker, Gingrich's treatment of his fellow Republicans led to a failed coup attempt. But as a presidential candidate, Gingrich has been sweet as pie to his rivals. In Saturday's debate he was given a chance to attack Mitt Romney and he refused. He was given a second chance and he didn't take it, calling Romney ""a friend who is a great business manager."" He not only has resisted attacking his opponents on the debate stage, he has praised almost all of them. In the Las Vegas debate, denouncing Herman Cain's 9-9-9 plan seemed to be the ante for participation. But Gingrich stood up for him. No candidate spans the rheostat more than Gingrich, who can go from sweet to sour in seconds. As the Gingrich candidacy gains traction in the polls, the key questions are going to be about temperament, discipline, and character. Those are important with any candidate--but with Gingrich they are especially so: They are the failings that led to his undoing in the 1990s. (He resigned as speaker, and from the House, in 1999.) We're all about to relive the '90s, and Gingrich's current temperament will be a counter to unflattering stories of tyrannical behavior from his past. As he has come up in the polls, Gingrich has rehabilitated his image. In April, according to the Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, Gingrich's favorable/unfavorable rating among Republicans was 46 percent  to 11 percent. By June it was 28 percent to 33 percent. He was in Sarah Palin territory. But unlike the former Alaska governor, Gingrich has been able to reverse the trend. 61 percent of Republicans have a favorable impression of Gingrich in the new CNN/ORC poll--the highest of any GOP candidate. The 21st-century Gingrich doesn't let his opponents off the hook entirely, or course. He just does it off camera. It was a previous knock on Romney that moderators at the last debate were trying to get him to own up to. ""Governor Romney is a good manager and if what you want to do is manage Washington,"" said Gingrich, ""I think he would be a pretty good manager candidate. But if what you want to do is fundamentally, profoundly change Washington, I think that is a different job."" If Gingrich's surge proves durable, his story will surpass Richard Nixon's as the most improbable political comeback in modern American politics. Gingrich left his speakership under an ethics cloud,  spitting that his colleagues were ""cannibals."" Unlike Nixon, who rehabilitated himself in the wilderness, Gingrich refreshed everyone's bad feelings at the start of his presidential campaign. He criticized Rep. Paul Ryan's budget plan. GOP insiders called for him to leave the race to keep from damaging the GOP brand. A voter in Iowa confronted him and sounded just like Gingrich himself, asking: ""Why don't you get out of the [race] before you make a bigger fool of yourself?"" Today Gingrich admitted that at the start he ""blew it."" Even when he was in the basement in the polls he has maintained that he would rise again. For a man with an ample sense of self, this might encourage him to return to playing Eye of the Tiger as he enters a room. Gingrich has benefited from a crumbling Republican field. One Republican strategist in South Carolina explained that Gingrich always had fans, but after his campaign's catastrophic start they didn't think he'd go the distance. Now that other candidates have faltered and given people a reason to keep shopping, there's a bit of a bandwagon as longtime fans come back to him. Being at the back of the pack allows candidates to be a little looser. Gingrich was almost sparkly in a recent interview with Piers Morgan, joshing with the host and luxuriating in his love of animals. But now Gingrich will face the pressures of being a front-runner, which means reliving that period during the 1990s when his disapproval rating was in the high 70s. He will face a lot of questions about his temperament and discipline, most of which he'll undoubtedly think are stupid. Whether he says so will tell us something about his temperament this time around."	"Why Newt Gingrich Is So Full of Scorn for Everyone Except His Rivals for the Republican Presidential Nomination

On Wednesday, Mitt Romney punched back hard at Newt Gingrich, telling the New York Times that the former speaker was ""zany,""  and the Washington Post that Gingrich was an ""extremely unreliable"" conservative. Gingrich responded by remaining on the high road, touting the speech he gave here at the University of Iowa about his proposed Brain Science Initiative. He promised that, as president, he would launch an all-out federal effort to encourage research, train neuroscientists, and speed solutions through the bureaucracy. He claims the initiative would improve health and lower federal health care costs, which would shrink the budget. With three weeks before the first votes are cast in the Iowa caucus, the two GOP front-runners are following very different strategies. Slaps at Gingrich aside, Romney continues to play traditional and safe. Gingrich is taking risks: His campaign recalls FDR's plan for a presidency of ""bold, persistent experimentation.""  It is undeniably in that spirit that a candidate who needs to win Iowa was, instead of touring 99 counties by bus, giving a speech on the nontraditional topic of brain science in a liberal part of the state. These opposing strategies preview of what their presidencies would be like. The question for Republican voters is whether the Romney's caution is what has made him inconsistent on issues. He strives to be in the safe and popular place. That is an electoral liability (at least in the Republican primary) and might lead to meandering leadership. As for Gingrich, the question is whether the mad professor can keep his experiments from blowing up and destroying the whole laboratory. Romney's Wednesday attack on Gingrich was familiar and straightforward. He criticized Gingrich's work for Freddie Mac, his spending at Tiffany's, his temperament, and his lack of stability. Romney is criticizing Gingrich's reliability and stability, which is not so distant from the flip-flopping charge that plagues Romney himself. Gingrich seemed almost in repose as he brushed off the Romney attacks.  ""I think a brain science initiative is a way to help other human beings,"" he said responding to a question about Romney's charges. ""I'll let him decide if it's zany. ... I'm going to focus on positive ideas and positive solutions. I'm taking the gamble that the American people care about actually solving our country's problems, not just politicians beating each other up."" Romney's chief critique is that Gingrich could explode at any minute. So it is wise for Gingrich to respond with flamboyant displays of equanimity and earnest problem solving. He also started airing an ad called ""We Deserve Solutions."" Romney is not the only opponent trying to puncture Gingrich. Ron Paul and Rick Perry are airing anti-Newt advertisements, as is Romney's super PAC.  The National Review penned a reverse endorsement, singling Gingrich out as the one GOP candidate Republicans must avoid. To nominate Gingrich would blow the golden opportunity to replace a weakened president, they wrote. A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll supported their case. Important blocs of general election voters actively dislike him. Women have a 38 percent negative view; only 20 percent view him positively. Forty percent of independents view Gingrich negatively, compared with only 16 percent who view him positively. Suburban residents have a 40/25 negative impression. Gingrich said that those numbers would turn around once general election voters saw him focused on solutions that help people, such improving brain science. Maybe, but as with the caucus and primaries, the power of his ideas won't be enough. Sometimes the structural realities are just too much to overcome, no matter how big you think. That's the problem he faces in Iowa, where his staff is still scrambling to put together an organization. Gingrich is hoping the nontraditional approach will not only save him in the primary but in the general election. For a candidate once left for dead who stuck with his strategy and rose again, it might be a brilliant approach. Or, it might just be zany."

A middle-aged woman, who'd been chanting along with the usual stuff--""Whose ports? Our ports!"" and ""What's the direction? Insurrection!"" --started in on a version of the labor movement's unofficial anthem. It's supposed to go like this: Solidarity forever
The union makes us strong The new version went like this: Solidarity forever
Occupation makes us strong Occupiers would like to think that the ""us"" is the same from song to song. That's not really clear. The Occupy the Ports protests temporarily shut down some commerce from San Diego to Oakland to Seattle, shaming facilities owned by SSA Marine, which is owned by Goldman Sachs. ""The 1 percent are depriving port truck drivers and other workers of decent pay,"" said Occupy Long Beach in a statement, ""even while the port of LA/LB is the largest in the U.S. and a huge engine of profits for the 1 percent."" Unionized workers got some unexpected days off. They didn't get paid for them. ""I don't quite understand why they did it,"" said Sean Farley, president of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 34 in Oakland. ""They want to impact the '1 percent,' which I get. They need to identify the '1 percent.' Who is it? I heard the name of Goldman Sachs got bandied around. OK. Deal with Goldman Sachs. I don't think one day at the port of Oakland or Tacoma or Seattle changes the facts that bother you about that company."" The left's year of occupation started in Wisconsin and Ohio in February, when protesters rallied, drummed, and slept in state houses to shame legislators out of passing bills that ended collective bargaining for public employees. It's continued with tent cities in green spaces of New York, Washington, Detroit, and other burgs. But these aren't the same movements. The labor fights in the Midwest were, well, labor fights. The AFL-CIO, AFSCME, SEIU and other unions ran campaigns to beat the reform bills, then to recall legislators who voted for them, and then to overturn the bills with ballot measures. They actually won that last fight in Ohio. The goals were specific--save union rights!--but the ""occupying"" protests were sort of random, touch-and-go. The Occupy movement, and Occupy the Ports specifically, inverts the equation. The protests (or ""actions,"" as they're usually called) are specific, newsy, and announced in press releases and livestreamed by people walking with laptops. As West Coast protesters were occupying ports, their comrades in New York were wearing squid costumes to protest Goldman Sachs HQ. The actions are specific. The goals, as Occupiers get so tired of hearing, are murkier. ""Wall Street has tendrils in every aspect of the economy,"" explained Michael Novick, a spokesman for the Los Angeles/Long Beach protest. (His day job is with the committee planning a ""general strike"" for May 1, 2012.) ""The ports do represent a globalized economy, but the whole economy is distorted. If you look at those ports, you can see the exploitation of workers all over the country, and you can see the need to rebuild the country on principles of human need, fair trade. It's not just about the ports. It represents the larger totality."" All of that means irritating some of the people they're trying to save. In Wisconsin and Ohio, the role of the unions--the public faces of the protests--fundamentally changed how the campaigns looked. The International Association of Firefighters ran a TV ad in which four members of the union, all military veterans, spoke out against Ohio's anti-bargaining legislation. Unions and radicals were marching arm in arm, fighting the Republicans together, saving public employees from the guillotine. The last few Occupy actions haven't looked like that. The movement's villains are the members of the ""1 percent."" The people they end up publicly shaming are the police officers who shut them down. If the hero of Ohio was firefighter/vet John Szymkowiak, the villain of the Occupy protests on campuses was Lt. John Pike of the UC Davis police, a public employee who solemnly pepper-sprayed students, injuring them and escalating the conflict. What was the point of that? What's the point of occupying ports? A good person to ask is Stephen Lerner, who runs the Private Equity Project at the Service Employees International Union, and who's terrifically optimistic about what Occupy hell-raising can pull off. In an essay for New Labor Forum, Lerner explained that the movement could do what labor couldn't. ""[U]nions are just big enough--and just connected enough to the political and economic power structure--to be constrained from leading the kinds of activities that are needed,"" he wrote. The goal they couldn't achieve: ""turn[ing] the tables so workers and regular people feel more secure, hopeful, and powerful--and so the elite feels less sure of its control over the country's politics and the economy."" Lerner doesn't worry about Occupiers distracting from what labor was trying to do. Sure, they were inconveniencing people. But the longshoremen, having negotiated collective bargaining rights, aren't actually allowed to strike. Look at Occupier projects like the anti-foreclosure Occupy Our Homes, and look at the ways they actually buck up public employees. ""In Atlanta, they have been defending the home of a police officer,"" said Lerner. ""As workers are engaged in the fights with their employers, and various laws limit what the unions can do, it may be that there's a role for Occupy--just as people seized factories in the '30s--to be the front line of people challenging the system."" That's the hope, anyway. In the run-up to these protests, the Teamsters put together a letter from a group of drivers who'd be temporarily sidelined by the port protests. ""Today's demonstrations will impact us,"" they wrote. ""We would rather stick together and transform our industry from within."" But as long as Occupiers were bringing the media in, they'd use it. ""There are no restrooms for drivers,"" they wrote. ""We keep empty bottles in our cabs. Plastic bags too. We feel like dogs. An Oakland driver was recently banned from the terminal because he was spied relieving himself behind a container."" The longshoremen had cut good deals with their industry. Public employees had cut good deals, too. At first, maybe it was enough to try and save what they had. Occupiers are closing out 2011 by demanding more. They may drag the rest of the left with them."

Members of the audience lean in and whisper: ""Huh?"" As speaker of the House, Gingrich was notorious (ask the Romney campaign!) for pulling ideas out of the ether. During his post-congressional wilderness years, he's written an average of a book every nine months. We can quote the man himself: He is a ""cultural teacher, with a political campaign to change a government."" A mere voter or reporter hears him mention a random concept, and gets flummoxed. Be flummoxed no more! Below is a work-in-progress guide to the names and phrases Gingrich whips out to score extra points with conservatives. Previous Slate word watches--Bushisms, Palinisms--tracked candidates' malapropisms. This is different. This will track and demystify the terms Gingrich tosses out to demonstrate his brain size. If Gingrich keeps coining them, I'll keep updating this page. If you need a Newtism explained, email david.weigel@slate.com and I'll get on it. Saul Alinsky
""Obama believes in a Saul Alinsky radicalism which the press corps was never willing to look at,"" Gingrich said at a South Carolina stop last month. In this case, the media means ""outlets other than Fox News,"" as Glenn Beck conducted a multiyear Alinsky seminar on the cable outlet. The original community organizer, Alinsky--who died in 1972--helped build the organizations that trained the young Barack Obama and wrote the handbook Rules for Radicals. Gingrich and other conservatives see the entire Obama philosophy in those rules. ""Freeze the target, polarize it, and destroy it,"" said Alinsky--why, that's what Obama tries to do with Republicans! Tying Obama to Alinsky also ties him to the barn-builders and human-chain-makers of Occupy Wall Street. It also explains basically all government waste. Newt's message: I know, as the Republican base knows, that everything Barack Obama does is designed to turn America into a Warsaw Pact country. EMP
At the Nov. 23 debate, Gingrich named three national security threats that the government wasn't ready for: cyber warfare, weapons of mass destruction, and ""an electromagnetic pulse attack which would literally destroy the country's capacity to function."" He was talking about the potential detonation of a nuclear weapon above a city, so that instead of obliterating property, its shockwave would shred all electronic equipment within the blast radius. And he's been discussing this for years. In 2009, he spoke at a conference put on by EMPACT America, a group that pressures Congress to protect against the threat. The same year, his frequent co-author William R. Forstchen wrote a novel about an America left reeling from an EMP attack. Gingrich provided the foreword. Newt's message: I am a futurist, not a bed-wetter--and I think more about national security than the other guys do. Lean Six Sigma
""If we were serious,"" said Gingrich in the Nov. 23 debate, ""we would apply Strong America Now's model of Lean Six Sigma. We would save $500 billion a year by having an efficient effective federal government."" He's been saying this for months, ever since he encountered Strong America Now--a ""grassroots"" group created by Lean Six Sigma designer Michael George--and signed its pledge, promising to implement the business-efficiency program. Lean Six Sigma's tenets include a reorganization of federal employees, with 1 percent of them becoming ""white belts"" and 3 percent becoming ""green belts."" Newt's message: I can save more money in one year than those stupid debt plans would have saved, just by making people wear belts. The Chile/Galveston Plan
Gingrich's social security plan, as he reminded a debate audience on Nov. 23, is ""based on Chile and based on Galveston, Texas."" Under Pinochet, Chile offered its citizens a choice: pay into a social security system with a payroll tax, or put that tax money into a private investment account. Under more benevolent rule, Galveston did the same thing. Herman Cain loved ""the Chilean model,"" too, and during the 2005 social security fight (which ended with no reform at all), libertarian and conservatives kept citing it as proof that privatization would work. Newt's message: I'm going to privatize social security, and it will cost nothing. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787
When he's in front of religious audiences, as at the Thanksgiving Family Forum on Nov. 27, Gingrich likes to mention the act that organized the ""northwest territory"" (the modern Midwest), prohibited slavery, and established local governance. How is it relevant to Republican politics? He explained in his 2010 book To Save America. ""The founding fathers overwhelmingly agreed that religion was crucial in sustaining the culture of responsibility needed to keep the country free,"" wrote Gingrich. He then quoted the ordinance: ""Religion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged."" ""Note the order,"" wrote Gingrich. ""First comes religion. Then comes morality. Knowledge is the last goal."" Newt's message: I may have been divorced twice, but don't worry about me separating church and state. Confused by Newt Gingrich's arcane references? Send your queries to david.weigel@slate.com."

The Ohio Democrat didn't clash with bankers over TARP oversight, like Elizabeth Warren had. She, as Republican ad-makers are now telling Massachusetts voters, is a Harvard professor who loves Occupy Wall Street. Cordray is a five-time Jeopardy! champion and a former state attorney general. Easy sell. So Cordray went through the nomination junket. Democrats put him up for a vote. Shortly after 10:30 a.m. today, he was filibustered by all but one Republican. President Obama, who's watched a number of nominations fall before Mitch McConnell's buzzsaw, tromped down to the White House briefing room to share his outrage. ""My hope and expectation,"" said Obama, ""is that Republicans who blocked this nomination come to their senses."" With that indignation out of the way, he fielded a question about whether he'd appoint Cordray in a recess. ""We're gonna look at all our options,"" he said. He might have to. ""Part of what's happened over on Capitol Hill is they will hold up nominations to make points. I've got assistant secretaries to the Treasury who are being held up for no reason just to see if they can use that to reverse some law that's already been passed."" That's true. Republicans blocked Cordray because, having lost the fight over whether the CFPB should exist, they want to prevent it from functioning. Filibuster is a fine, accurate word for this, but a better word might be nullification. And this GOP attempt at nullification will probably work. Republicans will talk about this strategy to anyone who listens. They talked about it in the run-up to the vote. ""We really are not arguing about Mr. Cordray,"" Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, told PBS News on Dec. 7. ""I think he does have qualifications, if we could get this structure set, so that there would be an accountability in this agency, which there is not."" That day, I asked Sen. Richard Lugar if the CFPB would be hampered by a Cordray filibuster. ""I don't see that as a problem,"" he said. ""I think the creation of this particular organization in this form was a legislative disaster. It's not a question of the merits of the nominee. It's a question of accountability."" This is what Republicans were saying about the CFPB in 2010. They didn't like that it was set up as part of the Federal Reserve, and they didn't like that its chairman would be given a five-year term, which meant he didn't serve at the pleasure of the current president. They lost; the CFPB was born. Republicans responded to the birth of the CFPB exactly how Hiroo Onada responded to the end of World War II--by pretending they hadn't really lost. After today's vote, multiple Republicans--Sen. Jon Cornyn and Sen. Roy Blunt, to name two--announced that they'd defeated an ""unaccountable czar."" Conservative columnist Michelle Malkin labeled Cordray a ""super-czar."" A ""czar,"" according to the legislation that House Republicans have introduced to ban such positions, is somebody ""inappropriately appointed to such position (on other than an interim basis), without the advice and consent of the Senate."" When GOP leaders applied that name to Cordray, they shifted the goalposts. Now, a ""czar"" is simply somebody who does a job that Republicans don't want to exist. The irony is that the urge to nullify troublesome government posts is turning more people into ""czars."" The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is supposed to be led by a Senate-confirmed appointee. In 2011, this leader was Dr. Donald Berwick, a man who once said that the future of health care would ""of course"" involve rationing. Senate Republicans pledged to filibuster him. He got a recess appointment, served out a partial term, then left. Republicans (led here by Sen. Jon Kyl) argued that the administration was afraid of a ""debate"" about rationing, as if Republicans weren't going to filibuster Berwick when that hypothetical debate was over. The Independent Payment Advisory Board, the Fed-like organism that would ration care, hasn't been staffed yet--Republicans have said they won't confirm people to serve on it. I asked Lugar how IPAB would be affected if no one was confirmed to it. ""There's always the possibility of filling these jobs during a recess,"" he shrugged. But perhaps Lugar doesn't even need to worry about that possibility. Since the end of May, the Republican-run House has effectively ended recess appointments. How? By simply refusing to go into recess. This isn't a new idea. When Democrats took the House and Senate in 2006, they declined to pass adjournment resolutions during breaks. Keeping Congress in ""pro forma sessions"" turns out to be easy--you send a member from Virginia or Maryland in to bang the gavel every third day, and voila, no recess. Republicans aren't saying anything on the record yet about how they'll handle the end of the year, when there's typically a short recess to mark the interregnum between sessions. (There's a chance that the payroll tax fight could drag on longer than they planned.) We do know what they're allowed to do. The House could refuse to adjourn until the moment before the next session begins. On Jan. 3, at 11:59 a.m., it could end the first session of the 112th Congress; at noon, the second session would begin. No time for a recess. No way for Obama to appoint someone to the CFPB or anything else. Are there ways for the administration or Senate Democrats to get around this? There are theories, and the political scientist Jonathan Bernstein has been collecting the best ones. ThinkProgress judicial blogger Ian Millhiser has called for Obama to use ""the Teddy Roosevelt precedent"" and copy what the original progressive did in 1903, when a half-day recess turned into an orgy of 160 appointments. What would prevent the White House from hitting ""print"" on the news that it had appointed Richard Cordray a few seconds after 11:59 a.m.? McConnell spokesman Don Stewart dismissed that idea. In the ""modern era,"" he pointed out, no president has made an appointment during a recess lasting less than 10 days. The strong hint: If Obama tries to pull that move, he'll be breaking all acceptable precedents. He'll be using a nuclear option, staging a constitutional crisis. The Republicans? Why, they're only nullifying the jobs that shouldn't exist in the first place. And as far as the GOP is concerned, it's easy to win a stare-down if the other guy always blinks."	"Republicans Aren't Filibustering Obama's Consumer Protection Nominee. They're ""Nullifying"" the Job Itself."
20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/12/gingrich_vs_romney_why_newt_is_surging_in_iowa_.html	"DES MOINES--Conservatives prize constancy above all else, but if Republicans are really faced with a choice between Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney, this will be a nomination defined by reversals. Nominating Gingrich will require conservatives to embrace a sweeping ideological reversal. Nominating Romney will require Republicans to embrace a candidate who is defined by personal reversals. If Mitt Romney is the nominee, conservatives will have to reverse themselves on the idea of constancy itself. His flips are numerous and on videotape. Gingrich would need persuade two of the most powerful forces in modern Republican politics to reverse themselves. Social conservatives and Tea Party activists would appear to have insurmountable objections to Gingrich. Social conservative leaders have long argued that presidents must have a sterling private history. Gingrich has the most checkered personal past in the Republican field, with two divorces and an admitted adulterous affair. Tea Party activists, meanwhile, largely blame establishment politicians in both parties for government bloat and a system that rewards the well-connected and influential. Gingrich was in Congress for 20 years and afterward joined the non-elected establishment, making millions working for Freddie Mac and other private companies seeking influence and advice in Washington. Gingrich appears to be well on his way to winning over social conservatives and Tea Party supporters in Iowa. Gingrich is the front-runner and leads Romney by between 8 and 9 points in the most recent Des Moines Register poll and the NBC/Marist poll.  

Social conservatives have played a key role in the state, voting Pat Robertson to second in the 1988 caucuses and giving Mike Huckabee the win in 2008. The polls show evangelical voters backing Gingrich, who regularly and freely admits his past sins. (Thirty-one percent of evangelical voters support him in the Marist poll; Romney, the next closest competitor gets 14 percent.) Mitt Romney was the one who was supposed to be helped by the fact that social conservatives were going to be less focused on family values issues in this election. Right now Gingrich appears to be benefitting. Gingrich also doesn't seem to be hurt by his Washington credentials. Before Herman Cain ended his candidacy, his campaign called voters who had previously told volunteers they planned to vote for Cain. twenty-five percent of the committed dropped off, according to former Cain Iowa Chairman Steve Grubbs. 83 percent of those departing Cain voters--who had backed the candidate who based his campaign on a lack of Washington experience--said they were supporting Gingrich. He is leading in the Iowa polls and in other states because voters want to be inspired by a conservative message. Mitt Romney doesn't do that. When voters were asked by the Des Moines Register which candidate is most like Ronald Reagan, Gingrich was at 25 percent, 14 points ahead of Romney. He also bested Romney by double-digit margins on questions of experience, knowledge, and which candidate is likely to bring about change. Romney, who has never been a Washington politician, has run a risk-free, establishment campaign. Gingrich, the consummate insider, comes across as the bomb-throwing radical. Gingrich represents a much more serious challenge to Romney than Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, or Rick Perry ever did. When other candidates challenged Romney, his advisers could say that he still held the two trump cards. He was the candidate voters thought could handle economic issues--their No. 1 concern--and he was the candidate they considered most likely to beat Barack Obama. Not so much anymore. When asked which candidate can better turn around the economy, Gingrich wins 22 percent of the support and Romney 20 percent. The electability question is less clear, but still not a clean win for Romney. In the Des Moines Register poll, when people were asked which candidate was more electable, Romney got 38 percent to Gingrich's weak 22 percent.  But in the Marist poll, 38 percent of those whose key concern was beating President Obama picked Gingrich, compared with 25 percent who supported Romney. (UPDATE: The latest Washington Post poll in Iowa shows Gingrich beating Romney on the question of which candidate can beat president Obama and which one they trust to handle the problems facing the economy.) Gingrich is the candidate voters think could better handle a crisis in the Oval Office, though Romney is the one they think is more presidential. Voters also find Romney more likable. For the moment, though, these are not the qualities they're motivated by. Gingrich's strong showing in Iowa doesn't necessarily mean voters have given up on their principles. It may mean that they don't know about his past. In the Marist Poll, 59 percent said it would be unacceptable for a nominee to have ""earned millions of dollars advising Freddie Mac."" It's now up to Mitt Romney--or a Super Pac working on his behalf--to make sure voters get a thorough education. He'd better hurry up. The caucuses are 29 days away, but longtime Iowa hands say the window of change is shorter than that. After Dec. 20, Iowa voters start paying attention to their families and the end-of-year football games--particularly the Hawkeyes vs. Sooners game. That gives Romney about two and a half weeks."	Iowa Conservatives Ought To Loath Gingrich. Why Are They Flocking to Him?
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/12/newt_gingrich_and_evangelicals_they_could_never_support_him_right_wrong_.html	"The last time Pastor Robert Jeffress elbowed into the presidential race, he was warning a crowd of ""values voters"" about the dangers of nominating a Mormon. Jeffress, who leads the First Baptist Church in Dallas, wanted them to pick Rick Perry instead: He was an evangelical Christian who ""sang the doxology,"" married his childhood sweetheart, and stayed faithful (as far as anyone knows) for 29 years. Easy choice. But Republicans may not get to choose between Perry and Mitt Romney. The current front-runner in Iowa is Newt Gingrich--thrice married, an admitted adulterer, a late convert to Catholicism. He's pulling voters from the other ""anti-Romney"" of choice, Herman Cain, because women keep tumbling out of Cain's closet clutching sexual harassment settlements and phone records of (allegedly!) decade-long affairs. ""I think there's now an evangelical tri-lemma,"" says Jeffress, who still backs Perry but doesn't have illusions about his current electoral oomph. ""Do you vote for a Mormon who's had one wife, a Catholic who's had three wives, or an Evangelical who may have had an entire harem?"" This is a problem. The leadership of the evangelical right, as loose as it is, has the most influence over a Republican nomination in Iowa, in the caucuses. With a month to go, the candidate who said the right things and built the right-sized lead over Romney is Gingrich. Evangelical kingmakers, whom Newt has courted for years, are discussing how to forgive him. The actual voters who'll pick the candidate aren't quite so sure. We know this because evangelical leaders have been checking. On Monday night, after Gingrich and other Republicans bared all to a forum put on by the Iowa FAMiLY Leader (the group keeps the ""I"" lowercase to indicate submission to God), radio host Steve Deace shepherded a focus group of six men and five women. They liked Gingrich. They worried about his personal life. Ten of the 11 were so worried that they wondered why the FAMiLY Leader included him in the first place. At Deace's website, Jen Green explained that the doubters worried about ""the affairs and the seeming lack of public repentance for them,"" and felt that Gingrich hadn't ""done enough to restore their faith in him."" They were accidentally disagreeing with Bob Vander Plaats, chief executive of the FAMiLY Leader. ""There's been a sincere life change for Newt Gingrich,"" he says. ""Now, if Newt would have had a Road to Des Moines conversion this year, it might be hard to take him seriously. But since four or five years ago, he's shown a very transparent grace and maturity. He's been married to Callista for over a decade. He's healed his relationship with his children."" What happened with Newt four or five years ago? Knowing this is important to understanding how he's calmed the various Vander Plaatses of the plains. In March 2007, Gingrich called in to James Dobson's radio show to atone for his sins. The timing was perfect. Gingrich didn't end up running for president that year. After 2008, Dobson retreated from the active political role he'd taken in the Bush years. ""It's a very painful topic and I confess that directly to you,"" said Gingrich to Dobson. ""There were times when I was praying and when I felt I was doing things that were wrong. But I was still doing them."" He had fallen short of his ""own standards."" He had moved on. ""I'm not trying to be a leader in the sense of rising above my fellow Americans,"" he said, ""but I am trying to serve, particularly as a teacher and as a developer of solutions."" In the years after that, Gingrich wrote two books about ""Rediscovering God in America,"" and produced two films with that title. He grew deeply involved in the conservative battle to unseat Iowa judges who legalized gay marriage. Gingrich's network funneled $350,000 into an $850,000 campaign, and the campaign won. This is why Iowa's evangelical leaders anticipate that they will need to explain the new Newt to voters and to a doubting media. ""I am very sensitive to looking hypocritical,"" says Deace, the radio host who moderated that awkward focus group. ""I think Christians have exhausted a lot of political capital this way. We have allowed Republicans to violate moral standards that we don't accept from Democrats. My encouragement to other Christians is this: First protect the integrity of your Christian witness, then put your political activism second to that. If you do that, you're not trapped by hypocrisy."" What does that mean for Gingrich? Deace quoted the Prophet Isaiah for advice. From Isaiah 1:18: ""Come now, and let us reason together, says the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool."" That's doubling as advice for Iowa evangelicals. Reason together. You like Newt anyway. In the scheme of things, his misdeeds aren't so bad. ""Take the Apostle Paul, for example,"" says Vander Plaats. ""He wasn't just bad before his conversion. He called himself the worst of the worst. He tried to thwart the gospel. He tried to abolish Christianity."" It's true: Compared to Paul, Newt's offenses don't seem that bad. The father of the church reminisced about watching Christians die, consenting to their deaths. This has all been discussed at the higher levels of evangelical politics; it's largely been litigated. If you read between the lines of evangelical leaders' statements, they're incredibly forgiving toward Newt. Look at the open letter that Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Convention, wrote this week. ""A high percentage of Evangelical men are willing to cut you some slack over your turbulent marital history,"" he wrote. ""The bad news is that Evangelical women are far less willing to forgive and let bygones be bygones."" How could Gingrich possibly recover? Pretty easily, according to Land. ""Mr. Speaker, I urge you to pick a pro-family venue and give a speech (not an interview) addressing your marital history once and for all. It should be clear that this speech will be 'it' and will not be repeated, only referenced."" That's it. The tone is not just forgiving--it's hopeful that the evangelical hoi polloi can forgive, too. It's scornful of a media that evangelicals expect to hassle Gingrich and his supporters for hypocrisy. The media didn't decide whether Paul had redeemed himself. Evangelical leaders won't let the media tell them whether they can redeem the new Republican front-runner."	Evangelicals Could Never Get Behind Newt Gingrich, Right? Wrong.

Sure, the 12-member team of rivals never came up with a deficit-shrinking plan. Its existence cheapened the prefix ""super"" more than anything since Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. But when the Gang of 12 died, the six Republicans who killed it formed a new pact: They would tell the history of the superfailure and the debt crisis the way it should be remembered. Oh, that embarrassing slapstick collapse? It was the other side's fault. Democrats absorbed the collapse and moved right along. After issuing a statement and giving a punchy press conference, respectively, Sens. Patty Murray and John Kerry basically stopped talking about it. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, co-chairman of the committee, signed off on the statement immediately before the Wall Street Journal published his woe-is-us op-ed. ""Republicans were willing to agree to additional tax revenue,"" he wrote, ""but only in the context of fundamental pro-growth tax reform."" Alas. ""The Democrats said no. They were unwilling to agree to anything less than $1 trillion in tax hikes--and unwilling to offer any structural reforms to put our health-care entitlements on a permanently sustainable basis."" Three days later, Hensarling combined his powers with his five Republican cohorts; all six of them published an op-ed (this time in the Washington Post) blaming failure on the Democrats' wanting ""$1 trillion in tax hikes."" This week, as they returned from the holidays, the two committee Republicans who'd gotten the most ink tag-teamed the podiums of the think tanks that sponsored the last GOP presidential debate. Sen. Rob Portman, a freshman and Bush administration veteran who'd called on Republicans to ""pull back from our purity test,"" headed to the American Enterprise Institute. Sen. Pat Toomey, a freshman who'd offered the GOP's most substantive superdeal, went to the Heritage Foundation. The speeches took place 24 hours apart--just the right amount of time to gin up deja vu. Portman on Monday: ""The economic policies that this administration has followed, and what this Congress did in the first two years of the Obama administration, has made the problems even more urgent, because they have accelerated the potential for an economic and fiscal trainwreck."" Toomey on Tuesday: ""What happened that brought about the massive budget deficits and the mounting debt that caused this committee to come into being, was, fundamentally, a spending spree. Remember, it's been this sequence of stimulus bills, and bailouts, and government takeovers--a huge surge in discretionary spending."" Portman again: ""Some would say that the answer is raising tax rates, that our current rates can never generate the revenue needed to govern this big and complex country. I would remind us that several years ago, only four years ago, in 2007, we had almost a balanced budget with the same tax code we had today, and the same tax rates."" Toomey again: ""As recently as 2007, the very tax rates we have today, this code, generated revenue that was about the historical average, 18 percent of GDP. And with revenue at 18 percent of GDP, we had a deficit that was almost trivial in size."" What we're supposed to hear, and hear, and hear, is that Democrats didn't care as much about reducing the deficit as the GOP did, that they were obsessed with hiking taxes, and that they wanted the whole shebang to fail to prove a point. The reason Republicans keep saying this, as Jonathan Chait explains, is that it looks to most people like they triggered the supercollapse because they wouldn't deal on taxes. Sen. Tom Coburn's mega-compromise, the nucleus of a ""Gang of Six"" deal that would raise some taxes while cutting spending, got nowhere. The ""grand bargain"" that Speaker John Boehner flirted with in the summer, the one that could have averted the debt crisis, couldn't pass a Republican Congress. A Gallup poll about the failure had voters blaming the GOP by a 3-to-2 margin (all voters) or a 2-to-1 margin (independents). These heroic, random Americans who answered calls from pollsters have a point. The Republicans actually admit it when they argue that Democrats wouldn't deal with them. Saying that the other party wanted ""$1 trillion in new taxes"" is saying that you wouldn't compromise on taxes. Defending the 2007 tax rates--sure enough, at the height of an unrepeatable economic bubble, they were enough to fund the government--is winking at the way Republicans demanded a permanent extension of the Bush tax cuts in order to deal. But Republicans need to convince the country, or at least the pundit class, that a deal was possible before Democrats brought a hunk of kryptonite to the meetings. They're still figuring out how to say it. Chris Christie got pretty close, taking full advantage of his role as a blunt talker whose rants are more often YouTubed than fact-checked. He blamed both parties for the failure, then blamed the president for not knocking heads together the way--well, the way Chris Christie would. ""What the hell are we paying you for?"" asked Christie. Inconveniently enough, the White House had hinted at what it wanted in a deal, and the summer negotiation meltdown convinced Republicans that they didn't want the president to meddle in the supercommittee. The Portman/Toomey tag-team might be helping, too. Dana Milbank, whose July interview with a sensible-sounding Portman helped create the impression that he'd deal, came back from the AEI speech with a heart full of hope. Portman was a ""genuine grown-up,"" and a good vice presidential nominee. Over at National Review, Jim Geraghty was floating Toomey as a vice presidential nominee. Neither guy has the overpowering charisma you typically want from a running mate. But if they convince people that a debt deal could have been saved if it wasn't for those dastardly Democrats, they'll show hall-of-fame political chops."

With 36 days to go before the first votes are cast in Iowa, Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich stand atop the field--familiar, formidable, and flawed. Romney has a history of shifting positions and supported the individual health care mandate. Gingrich has some of those same flaws plus a complicated personal history. The question for voters choosing between the two: Which candidate's troubles are too big? The GOP race for the perfect is finally over. It should have been over when Chris Christie bowed out, but Republican voters continued to cycle through candidates with the glass slipper in hand. With the clock ticking down, it's time to get the shoehorn and stop looking for Cinderella. New Hampshire's Union Leader made this point explicitly when it endorsed Gingrich Sunday. ""Republican primary voters too often make the mistake of preferring an unattainable ideal to the best candidate who is actually running,"" wrote publisher Joseph McQuaid. On Monday, Gingrich used the same talking point. ""I don't claim to be the perfect candidate,"" he told a radio host in Charleston, S.C. ""I just claim to be a lot more conservative than Mitt Romney and a lot more electable than anybody else."" Responding to a question about Romney's shifting positions on the issues, Gingrich said that as president, ""I wouldn't lie to American people. I wouldn't switch my positions for political reasons.... It's wrong to go around and adopt radically different positions based on your need of any one election, because then people have to ask themselves, 'What will you tell me next time?' "" Romney's campaign has been based on the very claim that Gingrich is now trying to use to defeat him: Forgive him his flaws because he is the candidate with the best chance to beat President Obama in the general election. So far the Romney response to Gingrich has been largely the same one his campaign has offered other candidates: Let them fall on their own. ""He contains multitudes,"" said one aide, quoting Whitman but meaning Go use Google. Gingrich has a history of being strategically flexible on issues from climate change to an individual mandate. Other Romney supporters are less opaque. A veteran Republican working to elect him was more blunt, arguing that there is no way that conservatives--and particularly social conservatives, who have considered themselves morally superior to Democrats for so many years--are going to put at the top of their ticket a thrice-married admitted adulterer. The battle of the blemishes was tested in a recent Bloomberg poll in Iowa, with inconclusive results. In Romney's favor: When Republican voters were asked to name characteristics that would disqualify a candidate, only 33 percent said they would oppose someone who changed positions on abortion. In Gingrich's favor: Only 48 percent said they would not vote for a candidate that had been married three times and had extramarital affairs. Bad news for both candidates: The finding that 58 percent said they would not back someone who supported requiring individuals to buy health insurance (proof of the old adage that a mandate is worse than a married date). As Gingrich was putting pressure on Romney, the Democratic National Committee piled on. In a widely played ad, it attacks Romney's flip-flops. There is almost no downside to the ad, which cost next to nothing. If Democrats can weaken Romney so he limps to victory, that makes him an easier opponent for Obama. If they help weaken Romney so he loses the primary and Gingrich wins, even better. As Rep. Barney Frank put it in his retirement press conference Monday, ""I don't think I have lived a good enough life to be rewarded with Newt Gingrich being the Republican presidential nominee."""	Gingrich or Romney: Now Republicans Will Finally Have to Decide Who Annoys Them Less

We recognize, however, that some families are like the actual supercommittee--and the day may end with one faction pouting to Chris Matthews in the guest room after a political debate. In that case, the better prayer is always Loudon Wainwright's Thanksgiving one: ""If I argue with a loved one, Lord, please make me the winner."" In that spirit, we present Slate's annual guide to this year's political arguments, so that you might be lightly armed for small skirmishes. If your family embarks on an argument not found in the list below, there is one catchall defense against your blowhard uncle. ""What proof do you have?"" you might ask. Often you will find that towering opinions are based on nothing more than a gut feeling. You can then point out to your uncle that if he wants to make pronouncements on the strong messages he's receiving from his stomach, the best way to do so is to thank the host. Who Killed the Supercommittee? Republicans: The GOP never wanted to budge on taxes, particularly the Bush tax cuts, which were designed to expire a year ago. Just look at the GOP presidential candidates: They wouldn't even consider a deal that had $10 in spending reductions for every $1 of increased revenue. Republicans offered a ""compromise"" of $300 billion in revenue increases through loophole closures, but that was a shell game, locking in permanently lower rates for the most well-off  and resulting in a net increase in the deficit. You don't get points for giving up after-dinner chocolates when you order the brownie fudge sundae. Even if you argue that the long-term problem is spending, the more urgent problem is the growing budget deficit. Everyone has to chip in. Democrats were willing to agree to $500 billion in Medicare savings, which ain't nothing. You can't attack the deficit problem with spending cuts alone unless you shred the contract between the government and its people. And as Ezra Klein notes, the party that gave more ground in negotiations was the Democrats. Democrats: You don't raise taxes in a recession. The wealthy, whose taxes you want to raise by tinkering with the Bush tax cuts, are the ones who invest. Since most small-business people pay taxes only on their personal returns, the added burden will hurt them most of all. Still, Republicans offered a good-faith compromise, which even Sen. Dick Durbin praised, that would have raised revenue through loophole closures. Democrats wouldn't take yes for an answer. The entitlement reforms they offered were too small. The president set a trap. He used the committee to get the debt limit increase, then refused to get involved in the committee's work. He wanted it to fail so that he could blame Republicans in the campaign. Nonpartisan Deficit Hawk: Don't apportion blame. Celebrate. The supercommittee failed in its mission of making bad policy. This is no tragedy. Usually politicians succeed in making bad policy. In this case, the $1.2 trillion in cuts are more likely to happen than by any other deficit reduction gimmickry, and the pain is going to come from all parts of the budget. The Bush tax cuts, which were always designed to expire, will do so. Spending restraint has been enforced. The military will be crippled? Don't bet on it. When it comes to protecting itself, no institution in Washington is more cunning than the Defense Department. In the 13 months before these cuts kick in, it'll find a way to offset them. Does Occupy Wall Street Matter? No: Lootings and assaults? Even Jon Stewart said it was out of control. Newt was right: Take a bath and then get a job. Perhaps the movement might have raised awareness of the growing divide between the haves and the have-nots, but the misbehavior of the lesser elements and the lack of a clear message will make Occupy Wall Street a forgotten moment in history. It is not a Tea Party  of the left. Tea Partiers rallied peacefully, politely, and they didn't cost the taxpayers anything. Their message was simple and clear: less debt, less spending. They changed the shape of a party and the subject of our national conversation. President Obama became obsessed with the deficit and went against his own party in the debt limit deal because of Tea Party pressure. He didn't do much in reaction to the OWS protesters. Yes: Since the protests, the number of news accounts talking about income inequality has skyrocketed. The pepper-spraying of an 84-year-old woman created more sympathy for the movement than isolated cases of violence. Besides, it's not as if Tea Party culture, which allowed racists to feel comfortable slurring the president, is open and welcoming. In the end, the numbers are on our side. The 1 percent might control the lawyers and the media, but the 99 percent understand the movement--because we're talking about problems they see every day in their own lives. Is Obama a Leader? No (conservative version): New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg had it right: ""It's the chief executive's job to bring people together and to provide leadership in difficult situations. I don't see that happening."" And it didn't begin with his failure to push the supercommittee. He ducked the findings of his own deficit commission. He turned his health care plan over to Congress, creating a patchwork mess. In the 2008 campaign, he said he would change the tone in Washington, but except for a few bipartisan cocktail parties, he never really took any chances to make rhetoric of 2008 a reality. On foreign policy, just remember one phrase: ""Leading from behind."" What does that even mean? No (liberal version): From the start, Obama caved in negotiations with Republicans. The stimulus was too small. He should have used reconciliation in Congress to pass the public option or to get real energy legislation. When he negotiated the deal to extend the Bush tax cuts, he should have extracted a promise from Republicans not to turn the debt ceiling into a fight. The passionate Obama of the 2008 campaign has disappeared. You never know where this president stands, and when he does stand firm it's usually temporary. Yes (administration version): GM is alive and Bin Laden is dead. The ""leading from behind"" you disparage produced regime change in Libya while limiting U.S. commitment of lives and money. Oh, and Anwar al-Awlaki is dead, too. You can disagree with the direction of Obama's leadership, but near-universal health care, financial regulation, a second stimulus (extracted during the negotiations to extend the Bush tax cuts), repeal of the ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy, and the withdrawal of troops from Iraq are all significant accomplishments. Liberal critiques of the president ignore the choices he faced and the constraints on his power. Conservative attacks on his leadership are really just disagreements on the issues. Who Is Responsible for the Bad Economy? Obama (conservative version): The president inherited a bad economy and made it worse. The stimulus didn't work, despite the administration's predictions that unemployment would now be at 8 percent. The Congressional Budget Office says the debt it created will be a drag on the economy. As the president said, the shovel-ready projects didn't exist. As Vice President Joe Biden said, the election should be a referendum on the president's stewardship of the economy. Excessive regulations, growth in government, and uncertainty created by Obama's health care plan and the Dodd-Frank financial reform law have put business in a crouch. A Gallup poll says small business owners cite government regulations as their most pressing problem. Obama (liberal version): Obama came into office with a mandate and a crisis. He could have lived up to those FDR magazine covers and pushed for a stimulus big enough to affect the $2 trillion output gap. Instead, he settled for a plan that (as even some of his advisers said at the time) was too small. He has wasted too much time and political capital on commissions and task forces about the deficit, when he should be focusing on No. 1 economic issue of the moment: jobs. House Republicans: Obama's policies, passed with no help from the Republicans in Congress, reversed a recession, avoided a Depression, and created 2 million private-sector jobs over 17 months. The Congressional Budget Office just said his stimulus plan created 3.3 million jobs and saved the country from going into a depression. These efforts may have had even more of an impact were it not for the Arab Spring, the tsunami in Japan, and financial instability in Europe. In the wake of these shocks, House Republicans haven't lifted a finger to support even the infrastructure spending they once did. As for the economy being weighed down by overregulation: Obama's White House has imposed fewer regulations than his predecessor had at this same point in his tenure. Will Obama Win Re-Election? No: The math makes an Obama loss inevitable. No president since World War II has won re-election with unemployment at greater than 8 percent. It's at 9 percent now and no one thinks it will be drastically lower a year from now. Presidents in the modern era who have an approval rating under 50 percent lose. Obama's approval rating is 44 percent. Short of curing cancer or fighting off the Romulans, there is nothing he can do to move his numbers up fast enough. Some 73 percent of the country thinks America is on the wrong track, while only 20 percent see it as headed in the right direction. That's as high as it has been during Obama's tenure. Obama's team wants to make this election a choice between two visions of government. But re-election campaigns are referendums on the president's performance. The independents who helped elect the president in 2008 have soured on him. They now disapprove of his performance in office by a 2-to-1 ratio. In the 12 battleground states that will determine the election, the unemployment rate is higher than the national average. In these battleground states Republicans are also twice as enthusiastic as Democrats. All Republicans have to do is nominate someone who is not considered scary and Barack Obama is a one-term president. Yes: The election will be a choice because Obama will have so much campaign cash he'll be able to make it one. The Republican brand is unpopular, and its candidates are flawed. The president benefits, as Ron Brownstein argues, from demographic changes that increase the number of young, minority, and college-educated voters. As for the polls, even in this terrible economy the president is still pretty much even with the best Republican challenger. Once he knows his opponent and is able to draw distinctions, he'll take the lead. And if the opponent is Mitt Romney, who does better than any other Republican candidate in head-to-head polls against Obama, then Obama can argue that his challenger has no core. And one of Republicans' favorite issues against Obama, his health care law, will be blunted with Romney as the nominee: The former Massachusetts governor may not want to admit it, but Romney's plan served as a model for Obama's. Will Romney Be the Republican Nominee? Yes: Republicans want to beat Obama. Romney consistently polls as the candidate who has the best shot. He has the cleanest message and resume for addressing the economy, the issue voters care most about. He has been almost flawless in the debates and voters can see him as a commander in chief. Republicans have been reluctant to embrace him, but that always happens as voters look for the perfect candidate. Once they realize that every candidate has flaws, they settle on the one who can actually be president, not the one who makes the most entertaining talk show host or bomb thrower. Conservatives will  split the non-Romney vote in Iowa, he'll win New Hampshire and then put the race to bed in Florida. No: Romney has been running for six years and Republican voters just won't eat the dog food. He's only tied in Iowa, and while he leads in New Hampshire, it's literally his back yard (he has a house there). Meanwhile, Newt Gingrich, tied with him in Iowa, leads in South Carolina and he has the momentum in the race. Romney does well when voters are asked who is the most electable, but Republicans aren't voting on that alone. With a vulnerable president Republicans don't have to ""settle."" According to a recent CBS News poll, 58 percent said they believe it's more important to have a nominee who agrees with them on the issues than one who can beat Obama. That's what 2010 proved to conservatives: They can win on ideology. They don't have to pick the most electable candidate. Is America Headed Down the Tubes? Yes: America has fallen and it can't get up. The Great Recession isn't just a dip: The U.S. economy has changed for good. The rise of China and India means millions of new workers are competing with American workers, threatening the middle class that created the social bonds of previous generations. Our reliance on borrowed money and foreign sources of energy limits our freedom. We have fallen from first to ninth place in the proportion of young people with college degrees. When it comes to high school graduation rates, we're ranked 18th out of 24 industrialized nations. In global competitiveness, the United States has been in decline for the last three years, dropping from first to fifth. We have had crisis moments in the past, but we rose to the challenge. Our current political system, however, is incapable of addressing any problems, easy or hard. It's not just the supercommittee's failure to come up with a plan to reduce the debt. Even on issues where there was once agreement, such as the need to fund things such as roads, dams and bridges, there is now just gridlock. Pass the wine. No: You're not going to get an argument from me about political crisis. Our government is a dysfunctional mess. At the same time, these moments of unprecedented peril are a part of our national character. As James Fallows argues, America is always in decline, and is always about to bounce back. Has the last decade been any worse than the 1960s and early 1970s, which saw political assassinations, an oil crisis, inflation, an unpopular war, and the resignation of a president? In its most recent report in 2010, the National Science Board still ranked the United States as the world leader in science and technological development. America now accounts for a third of the world's research-and-development spending. The average American worker is 10 to 11 times more productive than the average Chinese worker. Despite our problems, we still attract the world's talent to our universities and our culture."	Slate's Annual Guide to Your Thanksgiving Dinner-Table Arguments
25	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/11/gingrich_vs_romney_one_s_too_safe_the_other_s_too_dangerous_.html	"NASHUA, N.H.--If Mitt Romney is weak broth, Newt Gingrich is a bouillon cube.  Watching the two Republican presidential front-runners in New Hampshire over two days has been a study in contrasts. Romney is a known conservative ingredient suitable in a main dish. Gingrich is a powerful dose of partisan flavor to be used sparingly. Gingrich is having his moment now because he offers punchy answers and ready solutions to seemingly insoluble problems. If he endures an examination of his personal baggage, his record on the issues, and his private-sector career, it will be in part because he is the ""Republican Ideas Man."" But when you listen to those ideas--the scope of the change he is proposing, and the punch with which he delivers his pitch--you get the sense that that voters may not be interested in the Gingrich past because they're too scared of the Gingrich future. As Romney finished a four-day campaign swing through the state where he has dominated the polls, he touted his recent spending reduction plan and offered his carefully honed lines. President Obama ""said if he was unable to get this economy turned around, he would be looking at a one-term proposition,"" Romney said. ""Well, I'm here to collect."" Romney is the safe and steady candidate, and he joked about that when handing out sandwiches at a local diner."" This is Mitt Romney ""raw and unleashed,"" he said, referring to a Saturday Night Live skit that made fun of his boring personality. (It's true: There are reports he returned a VCR tape in the late 1980s without rewinding.) Listening to Gingrich is a more rock-'em-sock-'em experience. He's a whirring dispensary of ideas and insults. He's going to eliminate White House czars on his first day in office. The supercommittee ""is the single dumbest legislative idea"" he's ever heard of. Government retraining will be available for lawyers who lose their jobs because of tort reform. The delay in building a border fence is ""utterly stupid."" It's easy to see why Gingrich is appealing to Republican voters. They don't need to imagine the stupidity in Washington that Gingrich lampoons. His ideas sound thoughtful. He is good with a political attack or jibe, which is appealing to voters trying to find the magic trick to beating an incumbent. So when Gingrich boasts that he is the best candidate because he can beat President Obama in debates, he adds that Obama won't possibly say no to his suggested three-hour Lincoln-Douglas-style debate because an Ivy Leaguer would never admit to being ""afraid to be on the same platform with a guy who taught at West Georgia College."" Gingrich is competing on Romney's turf with that claim about debates. Polls regularly show that voters believe Romney is one who can beat Obama. His business background gives him a good pitch on the economy. Gingrich is trying to leverage his impressive performances in the debates into an argument for why he can go the distance. Like many of Gingrich's theories, it sounds good--but general election debates will have a different audience. Gingrich won't be pitching to conservatives looking for a fighting champion. He'll be talking to independent and undecided voters. Do they really want Gingrich's message of big change, brusquely delivered? In scope and personality Gingrich asks a lot. He's talking about profound change. (His boldness is a regular theme of his talks.) But people are already bounced around by change. Do voters really want a constant flow of it from the professor? Even if the strategy is to make government more efficient and get it out of your life, the main takeaway of the Gingrich idea flurry is that everything is going to get thrown upside down. Gingrich delivers his ideas with punch. He lays waste to his enemies. But what's the broad audience for a constant diet of stupid this and stupid that? He often talks like a bully. The targets are worthy enough--the media, bureaucrats, lawyers, those who don't agree with him. But even Nixon talked about ""the lift of a driving dream."" The overwhelming feeling conveyed at a Gingrich event is that if voters will only help cut the Lilliputian ropes, his genius will be free to roam the land. Political analysts talk about the living room test: Do you want this candidate in your living room every night? Gingrich might be a little hard to take over the TV dinner for four to eight years."	Gingrich vs. Romney: One's Too Safe, the Other's Too Dangerous.

That's what Republican presidential candidates have told us for more than a year. Radical Islam, they've argued, is on the verge of taking over our country through Sharia law. But this weekend, at an Iowa forum sparsely covered by the press, the candidates made clear that they don't mind theocracy--in fact, they'd like to impose it--as long as it's Christian. You can find video of Saturday's ""Thanksgiving Family Forum"" on the Web sites of two organizations that sponsored it: CitizenLink and the Family Leader. Here are highlights of the candidates' remarks. 1. Religious Americans must fight back against nonbelievers. To quote Herman Cain: What we are seeing is a wider gap between people of faith and people of nonfaith. ... Those of us that are people of faith and strong faith have allowed the nonfaith element to intimidate us into not fighting back. I believe we've been too passive. We have maybe pushed back, but as people of faith, we have not fought back. 2. The religious values we must fight for are Judeo-Christian. Rick Perry warned: Somebody's values are going to decide what the Congress votes on or what the president of the United States is going to deal with. And the question is: Whose values? And let me tell you, it needs to be our values--values and virtues that this country was based upon in Judeo-Christian founding fathers. 3. Our laws and our national identity are Judeo-Christian. Michele Bachmann explained: American exceptionalism is grounded on the Judeo-Christian ethic, which is really based upon the 10 Commandments. The 10 Commandments were the foundation for our law. That's what Blackstone said--the English jurist--and our founders looked to Blackstone for the foundation of our law. That's our law. 4. No religion but Christianity will suffice. Perry declared, ""In every person's heart, in every person's soul, there is a hole that can only be filled by the Lord Jesus Christ."" 5. God created our government. Bachmann told the audience: I have a biblical worldview. And I think, going back to the Declaration of Independence, the fact that it's God who created us--if He created us, He created government. And the government is on His shoulders, as the book of Isaiah says. 6. U.S. law should follow God's law. As Rick Santorum put it: Unlike Islam, where the higher law and the civil law are the same, in our case, we have civil laws. But our civil laws have to comport with the higher law. ... As long as abortion is legal--at least according to the Supreme Court--legal in this country, we will never have rest, because that law does not comport with God's law. 7. Anything that's immoral by religious standards should be outlawed. Santorum again: God gave us rights, but He also gave us laws upon which to exercise those rights, and that's what you ought to do. And, by the way, the law should comport--the laws of this country should comport with that moral vision. Why? Because the law is a teacher. If something is illegal in this country because it is immoral and it is wrong and it is harmful to society, saying that it is illegal and putting a law in place teaches. It's not just--laws cannot be neutral. There is no neutral, Ron. There is only moral and immoral. And the law has to reflect what is right and good and just for our society. 8. The federal government should impose this morality on the states. Santorum once more: The idea that the only things that the states are prevented from doing are only things specifically established in the Constitution is wrong. Our country is based on a moral enterprise. Gay marriage is wrong. As Abraham Lincoln said, the states do not have the right to do wrong. ... As a president, I will get involved, because the states do not have the right to undermine the basic, fundamental values that hold this country together. 9. Congress should erase the judiciary's power to review moral laws. Newt Gingrich suggested: I am intrigued with something which Robby George at Princeton has come up with, which is an interpretation of the 14th Amendment, in which it says that Congress shall define personhood. That's very clearly in the 14th Amendment. And part of what I would like to explore is whether or not you could get the Congress to pass a law which simply says: Personhood begins at conception. And therefore--and you could, in the same law, block the court and just say, 'This will not be subject to review,' which we have precedent for. You would therefore not have to have a constitutional amendment, because the Congress would have exercised its authority under the 14th Amendment to define life, and to therefore undo all of Roe vs. Wade, for the entire country, in one legislative action. Gingrich said the same strategy could secure the Defense of Marriage Act, which bars federal recognition of same-sex marriages and protects the right of states to disregard same-sex marriages performed in other states. In his words, ""You could repass DOMA and make it not appealable to the court, period."" 10. Courts that get in the way should be abolished. Gingrich again: The simplest first step which I would take is to propose--and I hope this will be a significant part of the campaign next year--I have proposed to abolish the court of Judge Biery in San Antonio, who on June 1 issued an order that said, not only could students not pray at their graduation, they couldn't use the word benediction, the could not say the word prayer, they could not say the word God, they could not ask people to stand for a moment of silence, they couldn't use the word invocation, and if he broke any of those, he would put their superintendent in jail. I regard that as such a ruthless anti-American statement that he should not be on the court, and I would move to literally abolish his court, so that he could go back to private practice, as a signal to the courts. Biery's order was an overreach. In fact, it was overturned two days later by an appeals court. But he's only the first target of the anti-judicial purge. The next words after Gingrich's threat came from Santorum, who said: ""I agree with a lot of what has just been said here. I would go farther--one step farther, Newt. I would abolish the entire Ninth Circuit."" 11. The purge of judges should be based on public opinion. Gingrich once more: Part of the purpose of singling out Judge Biery and eliminating his job is to communicate the standard that the two elected branches have the power and the authority to educate the judiciary when it deviates too far from the American people. And I think you would probably take that approach. 12. Freedom means obeying morality. Santorum concluded, ""Our founders understood liberty is not what you want to do, but what you ought to do. That's what liberty really is about."" There was one voice of dissent among the candidates. Ron Paul, the libertarian congressman from Texas, argued that people should be allowed to make bad decisions, that freedom of choice in religious matters should extend to atheists, and that powers not reserved to the federal government should be left to the states. But in a field of candidates bent on legislating Christian morality and purging uncooperative judges, Paul stood alone. Protecting America is too important to let the Constitution get in the way.

27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/11/why_tea_party_conservatives_will_never_be_satisfied_with_the_supercommittee_.html	"At 2 p.m. Thursday, as New York's finest were prepping plastic handcuffs and orange netting around the park once occupied by Occupy Wall Street, the Tea Party was fighting its own battle with the Man. More than 100 Tea Partiers had traveled to the Russell Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill to witness the results of a supercommittee-style Tea Party Debt Commission. They entered the building. They walked to the hearing room. They found their seats. Then they got kicked out. Security snatched placards off the podium. Sen. Mike Lee, the Utah freshman emceeing the show, tried to save it: That didn't work, so Lee stood in the center of the room and announced an exodus to a conservative college's auditorium, a few blocks away. ""I will explain why when we get there,"" said Lee. ""What we have to discuss is sufficiently important that we need not have any threat of interference by any Senate staff member!"" The crowd broke into cheers, temporarily putting down smartphones and cameras to clap their hands. They marched from the room, down the stairs that really seem too large for humans, and onto the sidewalk. Lee explained that FreedomWorks, the Tea Party group that came up with this commission, had referred to the event as a ""hearing,"" and the Senate Rules Committee had objected to it, thus the sudden and unexpected purge. I pointed out to Lee that this was happening as the Tea Party's bizarro cousin, just a short Acela ride away, was getting shut down by cops. ""The difference,"" said Lee, ""is that we're peaceably assembling."" There were other differences. The Occupy Wall Street struggle in New York folded not-so-neatly into a long-planned Day of Action by progressive groups. In 300-odd cities, progressives positioned themselves next to bridges they wanted more funding for, or businesses they wanted to shame. They got media coverage--lots of it. They got arrested. They had to put up with a lot more static than the Tea Partiers. Why, the reporters covering the debt stunt weren't even arrested. One more difference: The Tea Party Debt Commission was getting its way. The whole point of their project was providing a contrast, some goalpost-moving numbers, to the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction--the so-called supercommittee. That body only exists because the Tea Party demanded concessions for a debt-limit increase. There were six days to go before the committee has to report, and here was the Tea Party, demanding even more, acquiescing even less. They just didn't think they were winning. On the walk between buildings, North Carolina Tea Party activist Scott Broaddus--a Republican precinct chairman--worried that the supercommittee was going to do too little. ""We need to do something big to avert a real crisis,"" he said. ""We're heading down the road to Greece. You get to a point, and there's going to be civil unrest."" Greece wasn't the only nightmare scenario that came up. David Kirkham, a Utah Tea Party activist who served as one of the 12 commissioners--the same number as the real supercommittee!--told the crowd of a 1995 trip he'd taken to Poland, when he watched factory workers laid off en masse. ""That's the end of the road of socialism,"" he warned. ""That's the end of the road of TARP, of bailouts."" That was the worry behind the Tea Party's debt-limit crusade. It's different from the actual political risks that the supercommittee has to deal with--actually, it's even a little different than the discussion of how to eliminate the debt. When Standard & Poor's downgraded America's credit rating, it did so because the country's ""policymaking and political institutions"" scared it silly. ""Our revised base case scenario,"" it wrote, ""now assumes that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, due to expire by the end of 2012, remain in place. We have changed our assumption on this because the majority of Republicans in Congress continue to resist any measure that would raise revenues."" This was pretty clear: If you were focused on the debt, you had to give up some ground on taxes. If all of the Bush tax cuts were made permanent, $4 trillion would be slopped on to the debt. Play around, and you risk another downgrade. Supercommittee Republicans and the Tea Party have basically the same response to this: We should keep the Bush tax rates, they say. We should use the opportunity/crisis/partisan hatchet-fight to cut even more. Do any less, and you're not being honest about the problem. They have a point. Still, I asked Lee if it was important just to support what the actual supercommittee came up with. ""Look,"" he said, ""we face a credit downgrade if we don't dramatically, systemically, structurally change the way we spend. So it's not clear that even doing the minimum of what the legislation requires would solve any problems."" The Tea Party's solution: Do the maximum. The commission's draft budget makes the Bush tax cuts permanent. It allows workers born after 1981 to opt one-half of their payroll taxes out of Social Security, which would cost ""about $500 billion"" in revenue. It goes on to find $9.7 trillion in overall savings, by dramatically scaling back the post-1933 welfare state. Anyone who wants to opt out of Medicare can do so. Medicaid becomes a block grant program; so do food stamps. The Affordable Care Act is repealed. Physician payment rates are kept at 2011 levels. That was just the entitlement care portion of the budget, though it got some of the biggest cheers at the relocated hearing. (The biggest cheers probably went to the abolition of executive branch ""czars,"" even though that reform wouldn't save any money.) More savings were found in the discretionary side, as long-loathed programs were blasted out of existence. The budget ends all farm subsidies, the ethanol tax credit, ""foreign aid to countries that don't support us,"" earmarks, the Departments of Education and Energy (except for nuclear research, which would remained funded, just at the Department of Defense), HUD, most of the EPA, the Small Business Administration, the Bureau of Reclamation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and AmeriCorps. Amtrak and the TSA would be privatized. By 2015, the amount of soldiers deployed overseas would be cut back to 45,000. This is several orders of magnitude bigger than supercommittee Republicans are talking about. Sen. Pat Toomey has proposed ending the crisis with a plan that would increase revenue by $300 billion while lowering the top tax bracket from 35 percent to 28 percent. That, for Republicans, would be a concession. Conservatives, bolstered by the Tea Party, are saying they won't accept it. The elected officials who finally found the new ""hearing"" location were pleased with the Tea Party commission's efforts. ""I think $9 trillion is a good start,"" said Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky. ""I certainly would consider sponsoring this bill in the House of Representatives,"" said Rep. Paul Broun of Georgia. (He'd once floated the idea of lowering the debt limit.) ""Y'all just came up with $9 trillion of cuts. Was it all that hard? We need a couple more!"" The meeting wrapped. There were no arrests."

28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/11/occupy_wall_street_why_protesters_just_don_t_want_to_leave_.html	"By mid-morning, the campers of Occupy D.C. were some of the last people not caught up on the events in New York City. At about 1 a.m., New York police had begun dismantling the Occupy Wall Street camp in Zuccotti Park. At 8 a.m., images from the protests were on every cable news network. At about 9:30 a.m., when I got to the McPherson Square in downtown Washington, most Occupiers were still in the tents that cover three-quarters of the green space. The news was just beginning to trickle in. ""Do you know the latest from New York?"" asked Alan Ball, who'd come to Washington after leaving his English as a Second Language teaching gig in Tampa. ""We're piecing it together. I'm hearing most of it from reporters."" In New York there was a pitched battle, reporters being physically dragged away from the story, confirmed then debunked then confirmed reports. In D.C. there's a camp. There's some new angst about a possible night raid; there are contingency plans to survive it and come back. There's a reading library built with packing crates, so it can be moved quickly. There's a medic tent and plenty of free food. ""I think I've actually gained weight since I got here,"" said a protester with anime-character red hair who will only give her first name, Melinda. The protesters have few small problems. What they have is one big problem. Even if the cops don't crack down, and the city lets them stay--and that's where things were at on Tuesday--then what's to gain from continuing the occupation? Why stay in the parks? That's the discussion that the Occupy intelligentsia (no, I'm not inventing that phrase) is having right now. On Monday night, right before the New York raid, a new ""tactical briefing"" went up at AdBusters. The Canadian consumerism-smashing magazine, whose editors had dreamed up the Occupation way back in February, raised two possibilities for the movement's future. ""STRATEGY #1: We summon our strength, grit our teeth and hang in there through winter,"" wrote the magazine's Culture Jammers. ""STRATEGY #2: We declare ""victory"" and throw a party ... a festival ... a potlatch ... a jubilee ... a grand gesture to celebrate, commemorate, rejoice in how far we've come, the comrades we've made, the glorious days ahead."" Choose Door No. 2, and most of the movement goes to the ""high ground."" It sounded like a good idea to Will Bunch, a columnist at the Philadelphia Daily News who just published the first e-book about the Occupy movement, a history of the Oct. 1 march from Manhattan to Brooklyn, when 700 protesters were arrested. ""I think the large-scale occupation was necessary to keep the focus on inequality,"" said Bunch. ""But the flaws are starting to outweigh the strengths. Now, it should be direct action against banks, etc., and maybe even nuturing a few of their own to run in 2012 elections."" I got the same take from Rich Yeselson, a labor organizer who'd been optimistic about the protests when they started. ""It should not be a priority to take back the park, or any other public spaces in cities around the country,"" Yeselson said. ""If the movement can't exist without occupation, then it wasn't really a movement in the first place. It was merely an episode with some significant rhetorical and political impact."" Sure, there's a lot to recommend the declare-victory-and-go-home strategy. If you're looking at Occupy as a political cause, like the Tea Party, then the last few weeks of stories about ugliness inside the camps and videos of police shutting them down are risky. Just look at the poll from October in which ""the 99 percent"" played better than ""Occupy Wall Street."" A majoritarian message can be muddied and erased if it's tied to something that the average American recoils at. This hasn't really changed since Richard Nixon riffed on the ""Silent Majority."" It's what Democrats counted on as they trashed the Tea Party, too. So there you go: You've got polls and experts saying the camps can come down now. Just try and tell that to the Occupiers. ""I'm going back,"" said Jesse Le Greca, who'd become one of the movement's most visible members after a video of him debating a Fox News reporter went viral. ""I feel it is important to claim a space, but if we are not allowed to use the First Amendment at Zuccotti we will certainly find another visible location. The First Amendment is not up for negotiation, even if mayors like [Mike] Bloomberg or [Oakland's Jean] Quan decide to treat their respective police forces as if they were their own personal praetorian guards."" Thousands of people who want to resist the state and the capitalist system aren't going to stop doing it because the system pushes back. It's an encouragement. That was the tone at Occupy D.C. Nobody I talked to wanted to hear about the crazy ""stop occupying"" theory. ""Even if they do try and push us out,"" said Prince Dagom-bey, who sported a Moorish headwrap, ""we're gonna put ourselves back. That's our tactic. We want to maintain what we held."" But why maintain it? The best explanation came from Alan Ball. ""It's a symbol to show we have the right to be here,"" said Ball. ""It's the people's land. Also, for political reasons, it's a slap in the face of the people in power to be here. We're not above the law here, but we don't agree with a lot of the laws here. Trespassing. All the little things--you can't put your bike on that fence."" He pointed to a fence that guarded the statue of the Civil War general who leant his name to the park. ""We're not lawless, but there are no laws. That's our goal, to create a new form of society, a new form of community, where we don't need external laws to tell us how to live."" No quick political strategy there. To some protesters, the camps have becomes ends unto themselves. The presence of homeless people in the park was a feature, not a bug. ""We're learning a lot from the homeless about how to get weatherized,"" said Ball. Another Occupier, Melinda, showed me tents that had gone up on pallets, to keep them from absorbing the chill of the earth. The camps would stay up, even if Zuccotti was permanently unoccupied. ""If they shut that down, it really doesn't matter,"" said Melinda. ""That was the inspiration for all of this, and this is going to keep going."" It was going strong for the rest of Tuesday. The Zuccotti story had sent at least a dozen reporters--that's just the ones I counted--back to McPherson Square for fresh quotes. The camp, not the demands, were the story. At 5 p.m., the Occupiers gathered for a ""general assembly"" to get briefed on what happened and plan a new action: a march to the D.C. offices of the real estate company that owns Zuccotti, continuing on to the headquarters of the United States Conference of Mayors (to protest Bloomberg), ending at the White House, to get the president (not in the country right now) to take a stand. As the night approached, the Occupiers used the so-called ""People's Microphone"" to announce that in Washington, at least, their occupation of public space had official government support. ""Mic check!"" Mic check! ""The D.C. Council has just stated!"" The D.C. Council has just stated! ""That our occupation at McPherson Square!"" That our occupation at McPherson Square! ""Is in no danger, as far as they see it!"" Is in no danger, as far as they see it!"	OWS Protesters Know It Makes Sense to End The Occupation, But They Just Don't Want To

Inside, there are 12-foot ceilings, soapstone hearths, hardwood pocket doors, paintings, chandeliers, and a trail of food and drink leading into a fully stocked kitchen. This is the house that Big Government built, and on Sunday, Mr. Big himself, Andrew Breitbart, was standing on the front stoop with a glass of wine. He was one of the hosts of a 60 Minutes watch party. The show was going to run a story based on a book by one of Breitbart's editors. That man is conservative scholar and sometime Palin speechwriter Peter Schweizer, who met reporters and fans inside the house. Schweizer's book Throw Them All Out is released on Tuesday, and the publicity campaign started right here. ""I've been teasing the left on Twitter,"" said Breitbart. ""I said, I'm calling for a prominent person in Congress to step down. They're all thinking it's going to be a Democrat--oh, of course. No, it's going to be [House Finance Chairman] Spencer Bachus."" Breitbart described a scene in the 2008 financial meltdown in which Bachus stepped out of an apocalyptic meeting, picked up his phone, and put his money into funds that would rake in more if the markets tanked. He thus provides an answer to the question What happens when members of Congress don't have to worry about insider-trading laws? Stuff like this is what happens. ""It's not illegal,"" said Breitbart, ""but that's because they create the laws."" ""They have more inside information than the companies do,"" said Steve Bannon, the director of the Sarah Palin documentary The Undefeated and the main tenant of the Big house. ""What did Anthony Weiner do that was illegal?"" asked Breitbart. ""That wasn't it. What he did was unethical. These people serve at our discretion."" The Anthony Weiner saga was pivotal for the conservative media, and for Breitbart's place in it. The former congressman botched a direct message on Twitter, accidentally broadcasting an image of straining underwear to all his followers. It was deleted. He lied and said he was hacked. Media gatekeepers, among them Howard Kurtz, might have left it there. Breitbart and his Big sites flooded the zone, gathered more errant pics of Weiner in full-on social network flirtation mode. Cut to November: Weiner's a former congressman, and Breitbart's got a pied-a-terre a few blocks from the Capitol. Its first test: The Schweizer push. Schweizer is editor of Big Peace, one of the lesser-known members of the Brietbart blog family that focuses on national security. Throw Them All Out is about ""honest graft,"" the ""government rich,"" and ""crony capitalism,"" themes that have appeared in Sarah Palin's speeches since Schweizer started helping her out. Schweizer and a team of researchers from the Hoover Institution have compared lists of Obama bundlers to lists of companies that got green-energy grants, the timing of the financial crisis around the days when members of Congress dumped stock, earmarks that ended up helping former members build their fortunes. The ""Bigs"" are trying something new with this story, adding to and reporting a scoop about congressional abuse of power, amplifying news that breaks on 60 Minutes and network news. Is this a break from the usual Big Government/Big Journalism method? That's a question for Joel Pollak, a former Republican candidate for Congress, the editor of the Big blogs since September. (Breitbart is the sites' publisher.) He made the rounds at the house party, passing on little hints of what the site will do next, why it's all-in on the Schweizer stories. ""It's bipartisan but conservative,"" explained Pollak. ""The argument is: If government controlled fewer things, this would happen less often. There'd be fewer opportunities for these people to profit at government's expense. I think this book can start a debate on those terms. Look, it doesn't shy away from attacking Republicans. If anything, it kind of taps into some of the fervor that should be motivating Occupy Wall Street. This is corruption at the highest level."" Before 60 Minutes started, Breitbart gave a couple of reporters a tour of the house. The spacious guest room at the front has a massive, well-lit painting of the 16th president, so it's naturally become the ""Lincoln bedroom."" The walls in the living room are painted with a pretty Mediterranean scene; they blend nicely with a photo of a soldier deployed in Iraq, posing in one of Saddam Hussein's vacant thrones. (It's Steve Bannon's daughter.) Past the kitchen is a carriage house that Breitbart plans to use. ""This is where I'm going to do my tweeting,"" he said. When the show started, so did Breitbart's MacBook Air. There's footage of 60 Minutes reporter Steve Kroft grilling Nancy Pelosi at a press conference. The Kroft story didn't hit on everything Breitbart, Schweizer, and the rest of the Big editors plan to use. It did enough. ""Damning, damning!"" laughed Breitbart when footage of a frustrated Nancy Pelosi came onscreen. Kroft went into the Bachus story, detailing some of the options the congressman traded during the 2008 meltdown. In the carriage house, Breitbart moved his computer so that reporters could see his latest tweet. Step down, Rep. Spencer Bachus (R-Al)! You are a disgrace. MORE DETAILS COMING AT @BIGGOVT Breitbart kept the computer open, tweeting and retweeting, trying to build a critical mass of followers who agree with him. It has worked before. Back in the main house, Schweizer was politely accepting kudos, as low-key as Breitbart isn't. 60 Minutes ""did a good job,"" he said. ""I wish that they'd gone into more detail on the Bachus stuff, but they only had so much time."" He later left for New York, where he was on the Monday morning shows on CBS, ABC, and NBC. The rest of Breitbart's team stuck around the house, phones and MacBooks open, working the story."	Watching 60 Minutes With Andrew Breitbart and Roommates at His New House
