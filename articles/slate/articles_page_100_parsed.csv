Nextgov.com reported that federal workers might lose access to their BlackBerries. On Capitol Hill, staffers worried this might apply to them as well. The loss of connectivity ""could be a legislative forcing event,"" said one Hill veteran--many staffers use the devices for their personal lives as well as work. There is another reason there will not be a government shutdown, of course: Neither Democrats nor Republicans want it. Though their reasons for avoiding a day without funds are different, it is likely that--at least for the short term--both sides will come to some kind of agreement. The White House wants Senate Democrats to make a deal. It cannot have a government shutdown while the economic recovery is still so fragile. Though the actual impact of a short shutdown would not be dire, it would increase uncertainty in the business community, say administration aides, sending the signal that in the bigger budget fights to come, no one in Washington can be trusted to do the right thing. Such unpredictability may cause businesses to hold on to their profits and hold off on investing or hiring new workers. Administration officials talk about avoiding a shutdown with the finality they used during the Bush tax cut debate. Back then, they said the president could not allow taxes to go up for everyone. That was always the leverage Republicans had over the president. The tone is the same here: Obama cannot allow the government to shut down. Why? The country is in a cutting mood. The president would like to make the case that his cuts are smarter than the ones Republicans are offering. As he has said, he offers a scalpel approach, not a meat-axe. But he has yet to make the case at length, in detail, or with sufficient frequency. And right now, as one veteran Democratic strategist involved in 2012 races put it, ""the country is in a meat-axe mood."" In 1995-96, during the last shutdown, the economy was good. Now people are hurting. They trust the government less. They think it could use a trimming. When the debate is about spending, Democrats lose,"" said another Democratic strategist trying to explain why Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid will have to move more toward the House GOP position than his opening bid. Reid had suggested a short-term measure that would fund the government at existing levels while the parties worked out the longer-term agreement. The White House wants this resolved for another reason: The president doesn't want to engage in a full-on debate about priorities where every specific cut is argued over. He wants to stay ""at 30,000 feet,"" as one adviser put it, not getting drawn into every line item. (Look how a single comment about unions drew him into the Wisconsin fracas.) He wants to keep pushing on the ""Win the Future"" campaign to show moderate and independent voters that these fiscal fights serve a larger purpose. If he starts the fight now, it's not on the terms he wants. Republicans, meanwhile, don't want a shutdown because they can't risk having their first big public act be that they shut down the government.  Footage of Newt Gingrich will flood the airwaves. Gingrich, who writes in the Washington Post that House Republicans should not fear shutting down the government, is right that the shutdown wasn't as big a political nightmare as is commonly believed. Voters sided with President Bill Clinton by a 2-to-1 margin, but only 8 percent of those voters thought the shutdown had much to do with their lives. Congressional approval actually went up in the Gallup poll in 1995 and 1996. Clinton's approval was no higher than it was before the shutdowns. Republicans picked up seats in the Senate in 1996 and lost only a few seats in the House. One person who did not fare well during the shutdown, however, was Gingrich. His disapproval number in polls was always higher than his approval number, but during the shutdown his disapproval number almost reached 70 percent. GOP leadership aides are also worried that the narrative of the shutdown stories will be that House Speaker John Boehner is too beholden to the ""Tea Party crazies."" That diminishes Boehner's stature and suggests the House is out of control. What about those Tea Party freshman? ""They understand that if [Democratic Senator] Chuck Schumer is rooting for a shutdown it's not good for them,"" says a GOP leadership aide. So what will happen? A slight advantage goes to Republicans. ""Without presidential help,"" says a senior Senate Democratic aide, ""we don't have the tactical ability to fight this out."" Reid's staffers have been negotiating with Boehner's office for the last few weeks, and while relations have been cordial, House Republicans are not moving off their request for cuts. House GOP appropriators released a two-week continuing resolution Friday afternoon. It will call for $4 billion in cuts. That's a pro-rated share of the $60 billion in cuts House Republicans called for in their bill to fund government operations for the remainder of the fiscal year. But the pain won't be pro-rated: The programs to be cut are ones Obama has already said he wants cut, say House GOP aides, along with some earmark funds. House Republicans believe that the more reasonable they make this new short-term measure, the more Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell will be able to get some Democrats to vote for it. Twenty-three of them are up for re-election in 2012, many in tight races in states where they need to appeal to moderates and independents who, according to polls, care more about deficit reduction. Reid will have to see what his Democratic colleagues say when they come back to Washington after their weeklong recess. The House will vote on the shortened funding measure Tuesday, which gives the Senate several days to take a vote. Republicans make it sound like their two-week fix will give everyone enough time to discuss the larger bill with the nearly $60 billion in reductions for this year. It's not that simple, say Democrats. Two weeks is an awfully short time. One White House official said they want to avoid having to agree to a series of two-week extensions that essentially add up to $60 billion in the end. If Republicans have all this leverage, why not take a harder line? Why stop at $4 billion in cuts in this temporary two-week funding measure? Because they don't want to push their luck. They want to stick Reid with blame for shutting down the government if he can't get his caucus behind this smaller continuing resolution. The more aggressive they are with their demands, the more they might get blamed if it fails. It turns out Hill staffers probably don't have to worry about losing their BlackBerries. Congress is considered ""essential"" in a government shutdown (though, try telling that to the Tea Party). That means they are allowed to keep working and thumbing away on their digital devices. The initial fears about losing connectivity were overblown, which may go for the fears of a shutdown at the end of next week, too. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook.

That's how it started. That's why the AFL-CIO, SEIU, AFT, and every other union with a bus is at the capitol. But many of the protesters think it's about something more insidious. On the walk into the capitol today, I saw these six signs in the space of 10 minutes:	Wisconsin protests: How did everyone in Madison become obsessed with the Koch brothers?	[]	[]
2	2	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/02/extended_stay.html	"MADISON, Wis.--It became clear early Tuesday that the state Assembly would probably meet all night. The lower house's Democrats did not flee the state, as their colleagues in the upper house did. (For their trouble, the senators spent part of the day avoiding Illinois Tea Party members who'd tracked them to an Extended Stay hotel.) They opted instead to engage in a de facto filibuster of the Budget Repair Act. A list of 100 potential amendments expanded to a rumored 200 or so amendments. Republicans didn't hide their irritation. ""We're going to be here probably for a couple of days if we have 200 amendments,"" said Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald. ""But let me know. Somebody give me the one that solves the budget crisis, because I'll move that one up to the front. We'll get it done and we won't have to do the rest of the amendments."" At another point, Fitzgerald dismissed the Democrats' stack of amendments by saying, ""They're trying to stall."" Of course they were. Democratic staff explained the strategy: Talk endlessly, debating whatever could be brought to the floor. Stay as long as stamina allows. If fatigue wins out, let it, start withdrawing the remaining amendments, and let the vote go ahead, so the bill can languish in limbo while the absent senators traverse the Land of Lincoln. There's a lot about this impasse that no one has seen before in Wisconsin. The Republicans had participated in a quasi-filibuster before, and Democrats had suffered through it. But this was different: Inside the Capitol, within hearing distance of the assembly floor, hundreds of screaming, drumming protesters were howling in support of the Democrats. At times, crowds formed on the Capitol lawn right outside the assembly chamber. Still, it hardly compared to the stuff Democrats were hurling at Republicans inside the room. The session opened on a cordial note, with a bipartisan bill to salute Capitol police. As they did last week, Democrats wore Florida-orange-colored shirts with the slogan ""Fighting for Working Families."" The session then careened into a half-hour-long debate over whether Republicans had illegitimately brought forward a vote on Friday. Rep. Peter Barca, the Democrats' effervescent floor leader, issued a threat: He'd drawn up a measure for the removal of the speaker pro tem. ""If there's one more violation of these rules,"" said Barca, ""we'll be debating it and we'll be voting on it! We will not stand for that kind of behavior."" He spotted two members smiling. ""You can laugh back there, gentlemen. You can laugh at these rule violations. Maybe I should come to your district and meet with your editorial board."" Rep. Kevin Peterson, one of the smilers, got up to respond. ""Stop stalling with tactics on the floor,"" he sighed. ""As soon as you come and do your jobs, then we can have time to debate in the districts."" ""Thank you very much,"" said Barca, quietly. ""I appreciate that. Because first of all it shows how ignorant of the law you are!"" That last part was delivered with a full-throated shout, as if Barca had become trapped down a well and needed help from a passing helicopter. ""It's illegal! Are you really that cavalier?"" Barca and two other Democrats unloaded on Republicans. One of those Democrats, Rep. Andy Jorgensen, turned red as he accused two Republicans of fist-bumping during the Friday vote. ""This isn't a comedy club!"" he said. ""This isn't open mic night!"" It was a bizarre debate, one that Republicans weren't particularly interested in. ""We could stop the theatrics!"" said Rep. Dale Kooyenga, a young-looking freshman member of the GOP caucus. ""We could stop these back and forths, and these little games that politicians play, and we could say, 'No more! The consequences are too high!' "" So that debate ended, and the long parade of Democratic speeches began--complete with theatrics. In the seven hours of debate, they did not even make a dent in their amendments. They spent much of their time debating whether the budget repair bill could be referred to the labor committee, which would slow it down considerably. The point, sort of, was that they wanted more time to debate the bill in public. The real point was to draw the debate out. They could make soaring, 20-minute-plus speeches about the history of the labor movement; Republicans had to sit awkwardly, respectfully, tediously at their desks as protesters yelled through concrete at them. ""You hear that and you know you hear it,"" said Rep. Tamara Grigsby, a Democrat. ""I'm just waiting for them to take a break."" She paused. They kept screaming. ""OK, maybe they won't take a break. They've done everything they can do to make sure their voices are heard in this building. And what do you do instead? You put your head down. You look at your computer, you play solitaire, and you pretend that they're not there!"" This wasn't entirely fair. The Republicans had just as little to say to the protesters as they did a week ago. Beyond their appeals to generations of social change, beyond Rep. Cory Mason's history of the ""labor peace,"" Democrats were arguing with a different set of facts.  They point to an official state estimate of the budget gap at $137 million, all of which the Democrats claim could be erased if tax cuts were scaled back. * The Republican argument, expressed by Fitzgerald in one of the day's few Republican speeches, is the same as it is in every Republican-run state: The state's been living beyond its means, public workers have been living too large, and they can't ever be allowed to grow so fat again. The Fitzgerald twist was that this was not a debate about abstractions. ""I'm hearing from people I haven't heard from in 20 years,"" he said. ""You know how difficult it is to look those people in the eye and say, 'Yeah, you're gonna have to do it?' "" But Democrats could match Fitzgerald pity-for-pity. Rep. Mark Radcliffe used his time on the floor to share stories about the bravery of World War II survivors and the ways he saves money in his office. ""People tell me, 'It's so cold in there,' "" he said. ""I keep the lights off! I'm frugal! Every time I open my electric bill, I can see how much I saved by keeping my lights off."" The debate dragged on long after Gov. Scott Walker had finished his address to the state. (Rep. Dan Richards joked that it should have been dubbed ""the king's speech."") More people saw that than will see anything that was happening in the State Assembly. If they checked in, they would see Democrats trying to hold out on a massive battle--the rescue of the bargaining and organizing rules that make unions a political force in the state--by appearing to have the same willingness to make cuts as Republicans. They just claim that the union reforms, having come out of the blue, have no place in the debate. As the session dragged on, they sought new ways to make the point. Rep. Mark Pocan repeatedly waved his wallet at Speaker Pro Tem Bill Kramer. He bet him all the money inside that he couldn't find an example of Walker, during the 2010 campaign, pledging to end collective bargaining for public-sector unions. Kramer claimed to have found one. ""August 29, 2010,"" he said. ""Walker supports a bill that would take away the rights of unions to negotiate health care benefits. ... I hope you're loaded."" ""So far? Errrrrrrr!"" said Pocan, imitating the sound of a game-show buzzer. ""You just proved my point. I wish I bet you what you had in your wallet because you probably have more than me.""

If they don't have sticks attached to their protest signs, they can bring them inside, where they typically tape those signs to the walls, to stay up until the tape gives out. These photos were taken on Monday afternoon in and around the capitol. One strong theme: angst and anger about the influence of Charles and David Koch, the billionaire donors to conservative causes. Another: concern over the Tea Party, which staged a rally in Madison on Sunday. Not a theme, but a trend now part of every protest: the quick adoption of pop-culture memes and references. Finally, this being a liberal college town in Wisconsin, no protest would be complete without at least one tribute to Robert ""Fighting Bob"" LaFollette.

4	4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/02/radical_politics.html	"When Faisal Gill Googles his name, the first page of results tells the world he's linked to terrorists. The Northern Virginiastan blog (""monitoring how Islam is subverting public institutions in Northern Virginia and the greater DC metro area"") lists the many ""concerns about Faisal Gill."" Robert Spencer's Jihad Watch reprints an article from 2004 by the Center for Security Policy's Frank Gaffney which calls Gill an ""associate of groups sympathetic to radical Islamists."" There is a problem: Most of what you read about Faisal Gill is not true. In 2004, as policy director at the Department of Homeland Security's Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection division, Gill was investigated by the department's inspector general over the charge that he'd hidden his relationship to the American Muslim Council and the Islamic Institute. He hadn't actually hidden it. But six years after he was cleared, he can't shake the story. ""It's on the Internet,"" Gill says. ""It makes me look like I've done something wrong. I get involved in politics,"" he says--he lost by only 499 votes in his 2007 campaign for a seat in Virginia's House of Delegates--""it comes up again."" He points out that he has a letter from the inspector general, dated 2005, announcing that he ""found no evidence to suggest you falsified or intentionally omitted"" information in his DHS documents. ""You think that'd be enough,"" says Gill. Gill has largely left politics, but his story's relevant again because of the latest skirmish in an intra-conservative feud that started shortly after 9/11. At this month's Conservative Political Action Conference, David Horowitz used his time at the podium to announce that there had been an infiltration--American Conservative Union board members Suhail Khan and Grover Norquist had ""carried water"" for terrorists. Khan's father, Mahboob, had ""held a fund-raiser for Ayman al-Zawahiri"" at his mosque in 1995. ""The Muslim Brotherhood has been wildly successful in its plan to become part of America's civil culture and to infiltrate the institutions of America's civil government,"" said Horowitz, ""including the White House and both political parties, and the conservative movement as well. ... Sponsored by his longtime patron Grover Norquist, who has been a pillar of the conservative movement, Suhail Khan was given a White House appointment in the Bush administration and facilitated [convicted terrorist Abdul Rahman] Alamoudi's access to the president. Suhail then became an undersecretary of Transportation, where he received a top security clearance."" There were a lot of problems with that speech (""I was an assistant to the secretary for policy and he made me an undersecretary,"" Khan says), but it was the first some conservatives had heard of all this. Horowitz, it turned out, was speaking because Frank Gaffney hadn't been allowed to speak. Gaffney had been saying stuff like this about Khan and Norquist since 2003, starting with a lengthy article that ran in Horowitz's magazine. In 2004, he was saying similar things about Faisal Gill. Are Gaffney and Horowitz completely wrong? No. But they've built a hell of a case on a small amount of information. Nobody now disputes that Abdul Rahman Alamoudi, a naturalized American citizen who was born in Yemen, was a supporter of terrorism. He founded the American Muslim Council in 1990, and donated to or served on the boards of other Islamic-American organizations, mining connections to Democrats and conservatives. One day he'd speak at a rally and praise Hamas and Hezbollah; another day he'd schmooze with politicians. He got away with it until he was arrested for a scheme to take money from Libya to assassinate Saudis, and he's now serving time in federal prison. ""When I first met Alamoudi, we were in the offices of [Norquist's] Americans for Tax Reform, along with John Sununu and his father,"" remembers Gill. It was 2001. ""I'm not going to lie, the guy was a huge figure, a huge Muslim figure, but I don't think he'd know me if he saw me."" That's one of the problems. The answer would be the same if Gill (and Khan) were intimately aware of what Alamoudi was up to, or if they were duped. The evidence suggests that he was duped, and Khan was at least partly duped. As David Frum explains in a series of articles detailing the Gaffney-Khan-everybody-else feud, the Bush White House did use Khan to bring influential Muslims to the White House, but it bottled its outreach strategy. It had to--the charges and associations were toxic. Gill's situation illustrates just how toxic they were. In early 2004, a few months after Alamoudi was arrested, Gill was informed by his bosses at the Department of Homeland Security that his name had come up in the investigation. Indeed, he'd worked communications for the American Muslim Council for a while; he'd been quoted by reporters as a spokesman; he'd put his work for the AMC, then being investigated for terror ties, on his public financial disclosure form, as well as his work for the Islamic Institute, another group with Alamoudi connections. He was told to leave work for a week. He came back and took a polygraph. He passed; he went back to work. That didn't end anything. In June, Gill was informed that Mary Jacoby was writing a story for Salon about the investigation. He planned to talk, he says, but was dissuaded by DHS, who also refused to make his security clearance public. On June 22, Jacoby reported that he was ""briefly removed from his job in March when the Federal Bureau of Investigation discovered he had failed to disclose his association with [Abdul Rahman] Alamoudi,"" and that ""the omission of the information on his 'Standard Form 86' national security questionnaire is a potential felony violation."" True, he'd gotten a security clearance and hadn't mentioned the AMC job on that paperwork. The rest of his paperwork confirmed that he worked there. This didn't stop the inspector general, Clark Kent Ervin, from opening an investigation into his case, supported by Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz. (Ervin wrote in an e-mail to me that he didn't remember much about this.) Gaffney was relieved. ""I hope that the concerns that the Gill affair represents,"" he said, ""will compel a far more comprehensive review of the Bush administration's relations with groups associated in various ways and degrees to Islamist organizations and activities."" It did and it didn't. Gaffney's criticism of radical influence and Muslim Brotherhood links in the United States is consistent; when there are new convictions of radicals trying to influence American politics, the critique expands. Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., whose Homeland Security committee is about to hold hearings on the influence of radical Islam, has a critique that resembles Gaffney's. That's worrisome to the people who keep getting accused of infiltrating the federal government on behalf of the Muslim Brotherhood. ""First I was part of the 'Wahabi Lobby,' "" says Suhail Khan, sarcastically. ""I was influencing government policy on behalf of the Saudis. That was one of the lines of attack. Then I was associated with Alamoudi. Now the latest is that I'm associated with the Muslim Brotherhood."" The association, once made, is impossible to escape. It captures radicals, but it can just as easily capture people who didn't know who they were meeting with. ""I was shocked when Alamoudi was arrested,"" says Gill. ""If you're going to hold yourself out as a Muslim leader you have an obligation not to do what he did. It tars and feathers people who have any associations with you, even tangentially. Obviously.""

5	5	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/02/united_we_flee.html	"Wisconsin State Sen. Mark Miller talked to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel on Thursday, dishing about how his fellow Democrats would stop Republican Gov. Scott Walker's ""budget repair plan."" There was only one thing he wouldn't talk about: where he was calling from. He and 13 other Democratic state senators had fled the scene for pastures unknown, denying Republicans a vote on the bill by denying them quorum. ""We're not all in one place,"" he said. ""We are prepared to do what is necessary to make sure that this bill gets the consideration it needs."" Later, Wisconsin reporters confirmed that some missing senators were in Rockford, Ill., and that others were in undisclosed locations. Some even claimed that state troopers, who stand to lose a little under the bill--which would dramatically scale back the powers of public-sector unions--were refusing to go after them. So can legislators stop a bill by refusing to show up? They might, but they're not actually allowed to. According to Article IV, Section 7 of Wisconsin's constitution, the legislature ""may compel the attendance of absent members in such manner and under such penalties as each house may provide."" What that meant on Thursday, according to the legislature's Sergeant at Arms office, was literally searching around the Capitol looking for the missing senators. (Sixteen years ago, this had to be done when then-Sen. Joe Wineke tried to skip a vote on a sales tax increase to pay for a stadium.) Senate Rule 84 defines what has to be done: ""The chief clerk shall immediately call the roll of the members, and note the absentees, whose names shall be read, and entered upon the journal in such manner as to show who are absent with leave and who are absent without leave. The chief clerk shall furnish the sergeant at arms with a list of those who are absent without leave, and the sergeant at arms shall forthwith proceed to find and bring in such absentees."" That empowers the state to ask law enforcement to find missing senators. What if the senators beat a retreat, literally? If they can't be found, or if--as apparently happened Thursday--some of them have crossed state lines? The Senate's options are extremely limited. ""As long as they're out of the state, the sergeant at arms is unable to get them,"" explains Dennis Dresang, professor emeritus of public affairs and political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""There's not much the governor could do. You might say he could declare a state of emergency, but there's not an emergency here."" Walker more or less acknowledged that in a Thursday afternoon press conference. ""We have faith,"" he said, ""after they do their stunt for a day or two--it's more about theatrics than anything else--that they realize they were elected to do a job."" No one else can do that job until and unless the senators return. Because there's no quorum in the Senate, there won't be any emergency legislation dealing with the Flight of the Democrats. ""The Republicans kind of missed their opportunity to change the 3/5 rule,"" says Dresang. ""They didn't change these rules, so they're kind of stuck."" An impasse like this hasn't happened in Wisconsin before, but it did happen in Texas eight years ago. In 2003, after Republicans took control of the legislature there, they attempted to pass a new redistricting plan that would weaken Democrats. Most of Texas's Democratic caucus fled the state for Ardmore, Okla., and only returned when they were promised that the vote was off. When redistricting came up again in a special session, 11 of the 12 Democrats in the Texas Senate fled to Albuquerque to stop the vote. How did Texas Republicans end the crisis? None of the Democrats were ever ""caught."" Sen. John Whitmire broke with his Democratic colleagues and returned home, for two stated reasons. One: He worried about all the other legislation stopped by the impasse. ""At some point in time,"" he explained, ""remaining in New Mexico is counterproductive."" Two: Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst had, in order to bring up redistricting, suspended the rule that required a two-thirds majority for passage, and Whitmire worried that the protest would end with the rule being permanently ended. (This didn't happen.) So the Wisconsin impasse could end with a compromise. Before today, some Republicans had talked about softening the ""budget repair law"" to attract Democratic support, perhaps by cutting benefits but not changing collective bargaining rights or by sunsetting some provisions of the bill. That would be the simplest way to end the whole mess. But that doesn't mean it's likely. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."	Wisconsin standoff: Gov.

6	6	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/02/forcing_the_issue.html	"The man in charge of taking back the House for Democrats is talking about rape. When the Republicans took Congress, says Rep. Steve Israel, a New York Democrat, they didn't focus on creating jobs. ""They focused on redefining rape."" He's referring to the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, the first of several bills Republicans introduced to chip away at the unpopular bits of ""Obamacare,"" and it had Democratic support. But eight days after Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., introduced the bill in January, Nick Baumann of Mother Jones reported that the legislation limited the conditions under which women could get federal funding for abortions. ""Rape"" no longer counted; what counted was ""forcible rape."" That started the biggest backlash in the short, otherwise happy life of the new Republican House. The Daily Show ran jokes about the ""rape loophole."" Instead of a popular bill, Smith had handed the GOP a toxic mess. And Israel intends to keep using it against them. He's talking about this a day after the DCCC sent out a fundraising message pegged to the ""forcible rape"" mess, subject line ""Outrageous."" ""We need to bring out 9 million independent voters,"" Israel explains. ""If you do a geographic analysis of them, they live in about 37 fairly suburban, moderate districts across the country. Those 9 million independent voters, in those 37 [districts], elected Republicans because Republicans said that they would, on Day One, focus on revitalizing jobs. And what did they do on Day One? They redefined rape. That is not what those independent voters expected from the new Republican majority."" This is the kind of bluster you can engage in after your opponent has dunked on himself. It will undoubtedly continue until at least Nov. 6, 2012. Abortion rights activists, whose relevance had been waning during elections fought over the war in Iraq and the Great Recession, have found a toehold in politics again. The strategy has three parts. 1) Wait for the pro-life movement, now at an apex of political power, to do something stupid.2) Pounce on the stupid thing that it just did.3) Repeat.The ""forcible rape"" episode is just the first act in this drama. When Rep. Joe Pitts, R-Pa., introduced the Protect Life Act, pro-choice activists homed in on a provision that seemed to let hospitals get away with refusing to provide abortions to women with medical emergencies. When South Dakota state Rep. Phil Jensen introduced legislation in that state--just that state!-- to broaden the definition of ""justifiable homicide"" to protect someone ""resisting any attempt"" to kill an unborn child, there was more backlash and more national news. The strategy isn't all that different from the one budget scolds use to attack spending bills, picking out the least defensible pieces and using them as battering rams until the other side gives in. ""I  think the anti's [the anti-abortion rights side] took a really big bite out of the apple,"" says Elizabeth Shipp, the political director of NARAL. * ""They said, 'We can go all the way, and do the worst crap we can think of.' When Chris Smith included that 'forcible' language in the bill, he knew what he was doing. He got caught."" But nothing really gets introduced in Congress without offending some interest group or another. Pro-choice activists have had an unusually good month of finding offenses and blowing them up to Daily Show size. They've done this during the same month that a conservative coalition called Expose Planned Parenthood has been releasing undercover videos of the organization's offices, claiming evidence of crime and corruption, aimed at denying federal funds for family planning. What are the stakes? The Republican House was always likely to pass anti-abortion legislation; pro-choice activists concede that it's still going to do so. The question is whether the legislation could roll through the Senate. There were reasons to be fearful. In 2009, Sen. Ben Nelson got 45 votes for an amendment to the health care bill that would have done what Smith's bill does. There is, theoretically, a Senate majority for pro-life bills. But there might not be if they become toxic, or if they're portrayed as part of a national bum-rush toward some Anti-Abortionist's Bill of Rights. The pro-choice members of the House, who hadn't feared much since 2007, met right before Rep. Joe Pitts' hearing on his legislation. It was when Pitts became chairman of the subcommittee on health that they figured out what they'd be dealing with. That's most of the plan. The rest of the plan, as Israel explains, is making life difficult for some of the pro-life Republicans who were swept into Congress last year. The theory is that voters sort of elected them by accident. And they are numerous. At this year's March for Life, an annual rally against legal abortion, 17 newly elected members of Congress spoke, stretching the speechifying part of the event about an hour longer than scheduled. The new members include lots of people who took over suburban districts that had been trending more liberal. The Republicans who won, in most cases, didn't run on abortion. They got pro-life support--the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List endorsed 14 Republican congressional candidates who took over Democratic seats. But Democrats remain convinced that the new class was never smoked out. Take Rep. Ann Marie Buerkle, R-N.Y., one of the Democrats' favorite examples. She started in politics as a spokeswoman for Operation Rescue in the 1980s. She didn't hide this fact, but when she began running, she said she'd ""be really careful not to make this a referendum on abortion."" Her opponent, incumbent Rep. Dan Maffei, tried to make abortion an issue. He lost. And when Buerkle got to Congress she immediately became a prominent pro-life advocate. Pro-choice activists can explain all of this, or try to. ""When somebody's out of a job and looking for one party to fix that, he tends to vote with his pocketbook,"" says NARAL's Shipp. ""It was probably more difficult for us to get through the noise last year."" It is tough for abortion rights activists to get through the noise. That's what the Planned Parenthood stings were all about: a way to win turf on an issue both sides had been entrenched on since the age of Betamax. Also effective for doing this: Making the man on the street worry that Congress is about to redefine rape. Correction, Feb. 17, 2011: This article originally misspelled Elizabeth Shipp's last name.

They emerged, and they contained far more red (the color of debt) than blue (the color of George W. Bush's budgets). They represented the spending projections over the next 10 years as presented in Barack Obama's Fiscal Year 2012 budget, projections that slowed their rate of increase but stayed high. ""It would be better doing nothing than it would be to pass this budget,"" said Ryan. He motioned toward his charts, and cameras started clicking. ""You can see that we have a tidal wave of debt,"" said Ryan, pointing to a chart titled ""Tidal Wave of Debt."" ""The president's budget, as you can see right here, doubles the debt within five years of taking office and triples in 10 years."" This is true. The Obama budget--which Ryan described as ""debt on arrival"" in the Republican House--scales down the ambitious spending of the last two fiscal years. It cuts the deficit as a percentage of GDP from 10.9 percent to 7 percent, then to roughly 3 percent by the start of the next decade. Over 10 years, it cuts 1 percent of spending. It never balances the budget. It doesn't tackle entitlements. ""Anybody who knows anything about me knows we have to tackle entitlements or they're going to tackle us,"" said Ryan. And then entitlements tackled him. Question after question came about whether Republicans would block the tidal wave by cutting entitlements. They, after all, are what make up most of the wave. ""I know everybody wants to get into 'what is our budget going to do, and how does it work,' "" said Ryan. ""We don't even have a baseline yet."" Another reporter rephrased the question. ""How many times are you going to keep asking me this?"" he said. ""I'm not going to commit to what's going to be in our budget, because we haven't written our budget."" Today, he said, was about the president's budget. Sure, Ryan was dodging the question. Today, he was allowed to dodge the question. There is a role for a Republican budget chairman who must write up the response to the president's numbers. In 1995, when John Kasich played the role, he criticized the budget that Democrats came up with, promised cuts, and delivered $1 trillion of them. They included a 20 percent cut to discretionary spending, cuts to Medicare and Social Security, and cutting up Medicaid funding into block grants. Some of these are things that Republicans--and Ryan--still support. Today was not the time for him to talk about them. But practically every other Republican did talk about them, however abstractly. ""The president missed an opportunity to lead today,"" said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor when asked about entitlement reform today, ""to try and address the biggest fiscal challenge we have. And so we are going to lead and include that in our budget ... it is important to note who is leading and who is not.""* The definition of ""leading,"" as of right now, does not include ""being specific about what to do."" What do Republicans want on entitlements? They will tell us later. Ryan avoided being nailed down on cuts by pointing out that the GOP would ask for the CBO to score the White House's budget, then start work on its own. This, again, is something we've seen before. In 1995, Republicans took a dare and introduced steeper cuts than anything Democrats said they could possibly support. Democrats made them pay, portraying the Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security reforms as daggers aimed right at the most vulnerable, most keen-to-vote-in-every-election Americans. Democrats are putting on their 1995 Re-Enactment outfits and girding for war. Obama's budget does not cut Social Security, and it promises, toothlessly, ""bipartisan talks on strengthening Social Security in the long term."" In the short term, it increases funding for Social Security administration from $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion. Total outlays for the program increase from $804 billion in 2011 to $817 billion in 2012. This has almost no relationship to what the president has been saying about entitlements; it soothes some of the progressives who'd been convinced that he would pre-empt Republicans, wink at the Deficit Commission's proposals, and talk about cuts. Oh, yes: What about the deficit commission? It had proposed new taxes and entitlement cuts; Ryan criticized Obama's budget for wimping out on the ""significant"" suggestions of the commission. I asked, as a way of teasing out his thoughts on entitlements, which of the deficit commission's bitter-tasting proposals he would have liked to have seen in the budget. ""Things that save money!"" he said. ""None of them are in here--[it's] $350 billion above nondiscretionary spending, none of the entitlement reforms that were proposed, none of the tax reforms that were proposed, none of the discretionary spending caps that were proposed."" There was at least one deficit commission proposal in the budget, though--there was a suggestion that Congress start eliminating corporate tax loopholes while lowering the overall rate. This is far less problematic for Democrats than any debate on entitlements. It's attractive to Republicans, too. ""People could have talked about a lot of stuff today,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who's convinced that tax reform is the one thing both parties might agree on if they try it. ""They could have talked about defense issues or entitlements. But a lot of that stuff vanished into generalities. The tax-reform discussion is a lot easier to get traction with than the stuff Republicans were ducking today."" But this was just one day of generalities. This is what Republicans were expected to say. One awkward day of spin doesn't erase this fact: The Democrats have set up a fight on entitlements and Republicans haven't said no to it. Also in Slate, John Dickerson suspects a  better, secret budget deal may be in the works. Fred Kaplan lays out even more potential  cuts to the Pentagon budget. Timothy Noah explains why the  GOP favors such inconsequential discretionary cuts.

8	8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/02/two_pauls_are_better_than_one.html	"Rand Paul has finished his speech to CPAC and is avoiding the crowds for a couple of minutes. Outside of a small media suite, where he's taking questions, there are foreign TV cameras, college kids wearing stickers from Ron Paul's Campaign for Liberty, and men holding folders of glossy photos that they want signed. They are kept at bay by security officers who, they will learn, are guarding Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld. Paul tells reporters what he thinks about House Republicans proposing deeper budget cuts than they were proposing a week ago. ""Good!"" he says. ""Maybe I'm having some impact up here!"" CNN asks Paul what he thought when Donald Trump, who had made a surprise appearance at the conference, said his father Ron Paul couldn't win the presidency. ""I think his chances are less than my father's,"" he says. He slips out of the room, heads to a car, and answers a question about his proposal to cut basically all foreign aid. Does the turmoil in Egypt suggest that foreign aid doesn't work? ""I read an article in the Wall Street Journal,"" says Paul, ""which I thought was pretty good, about how we turn on a dime from being best friends with people to saying they're autocrats who're not allowing freedom of speech. That may well be true, but it seemed like a little bit of a contradiction. We're all for Mubarak, and a day later we're not."" He is close to the car now, finishing the thought, and he's interrupted. ""Senator Paul, can you sign my baseball?"" ""I can't right now,"" says Paul. ""But I've been waiting here!"" ""He doesn't play baseball,"" says Paul's press secretary. ""Why would he sign a baseball?"" ""It's what I collect,"" says the fan. He says his name is Adam. Paul signs his baseball. Four years ago, Rand Paul was helping out his father on a presidential campaign that was not taken very seriously. This was fair, in horse-race terms. Ron Paul seemed like the sort of candidate who runs, makes a statement, introduces an issue, and fades away. The issues were abolishing the Federal Reserve, ending both wars in Central Asia, abolishing the entitlement state, and ending the war on drugs. No Republican candidate adopted any of these issues. Paul's supporters, younger and rowdier and more akin to quoting Murray Rothbard than other Republicans, were grudgingly accepted. Fast forward to CPAC 2011. The economic portions of Ron Paul's agenda are no longer controversial. Rand Paul is a U.S. senator who can command media attention and confused sports fans. ""It's not just that Rand is a senator,"" says William Thompson, a Georgia activist attending with Ron Paul's Campaign for Liberty--the group he set up after shutting down his 2008 presidential bid. ""He's one of the senators everyone knows. If you ask somebody who doesn't follow politics to name a politician, they might name him."" This is incredible for the CPAC supporters of Paul and Paul who've been coming for years. In 2008, Paul didn't have a booth in the exhibition hall; his fans occupied the one that Mitt Romney abandoned after dropping out of the race. In 2011, they have paid for booths that occupy most of a long row of the hall. They offer copies of Young American Revolution magazine, the official publication of Ron Paul's youth group, and bumper stickers that decry ""George W. Obama"" alongside ones that say ""We Used To Hunt Communists. Now We Elect Them."" Paul and Paul's fans are perhaps the only people in American politics right now who are head over heels in love with their politicians. President Obama's supporters used to have enthusiasm like this, but it's tempered. He's had to disappoint them by governing the country. The Pauls' adherents can't be disappointed. They got this far, didn't they? And they are unavoidable at CPAC, aren't they? According to Ron Paul's camp, his organization spent about $100,000 on discounted tickets (students could attend for $15 through Campaign for Liberty) and booths. More than 1,000 people here are Paul supporters. This annoys CPAC organizers, for two reasons. First: Paul's supporters have all the lungs and confidence of fourth-century Christians overwhelming the pagans. They boo loudly and interrupt the ""war criminals"" and ""neocons"" that the rest of the crowd spent the last decade venerating. ""I led the walkout of Rumsfeld!"" claims Ian Saggese, a student at the University of Scranton who got a $15 ticket. (He is wearing a Ron Paul 2012 button.) ""I was the first one to shout, 'RON PAUL!' "" He describes his politics: ""I'm more of a market anarchist than a libertarian, but I know that's not going to happen."" The other annoyance for CPAC brass: The crush of Paul supporters has rendered useless the event's straw poll, once a pretty good barometer to find out who conservatives backed for president. Last year, the first year that Paul's forces really shelled out for CPAC, he won the poll with a 31 percent plurality, nine points ahead of the second-place Mitt Romney. Reporters have already discounted an expected Paul victory tomorrow. Ron Paul might run for president in 2012. (During his big speech here, an adviser explained to me that his odd reference to a theoretical 10 percent tax rate was ""something we've talked about for the platform."") But Rand's celebrity might be even more important to the redefinition of the GOP that's very clearly under way. And his ideas, like his father's, come out of a movement that gives conservatives an intellectual explanation for the endless financial crisis. The crisis was caused by unsound money. The first step to ending the crisis will be a brutal course change and deep benefit cuts. ""I think we need to default on our debt with China,"" says Calum Pasuqua, talking about the Pauls' ideas with a few new friends. ""It's going to be painful, but it's going to happen one way or another."" The many events hosted by the Campaign for Liberty reinforce this. They're reinforcing theories that have leapt from Pauls' obsessions into frequent Fox News topics. But that's the intro-level stuff. This is the hard stuff. Early on Thursday, an overflowing room is given over to Tom Woods, a paleoconservative scholar who helped Ron Paul write his books and who'd subsequently seen his own books become best-sellers. ""I want to talk about the impossible fiscal situation of the government,"" says Woods. ""It can't be fixed. It is going to have to renege on its promises. But as long as we're facing massive cuts that have to come, one way or another, let's go back, then, and re-evaluate all these claims about government we got when we were in the sixth grade."" He starts to lay out a thought experiment: What if we look at the government as obviously destructive instead of obviously supportive? ""This,"" he says, ""makes the coming fiscal collapse an opportunity to be embraced."" At another event later in the evening, Woods takes a stage with both Pauls and Jack Hunter, a radio host who helped write Rand's upcoming book (working title: The Tea Party Comes to Washington.). Some of the crowd has been warmed up by an animated film, The American Dream, all about the dangers and abuses of central banking. (A staffer warns me that it's ""pretty fringe."") Members of the crowd are more interested in a rare chat among four of their heroes. ""We're part of that very vocal minority that says, we want better,"" says Rand Paul. ""Maybe it's in 2012 we get to decide who the nominee is."" Several members of the audience stand up with signs that say ""Ron Paul 2012--Take a Stand."" Hunter asks Ron Paul if he's surprised at how resilient his supporters are. ""It's been more than I ever could have anticipated,"" he says. ""I used to think, maybe I'd serve in Congress, then I'd leave, and no one would remember I was ever there."" Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

9	9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/02/gop_pbs_npr_doa.html	The new chairman of the House appropriations committee, Harold Rogers, R-Ky., has proposed zeroing out the budget for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds public television and radio. This is far from the most troublesome of the GOP's proposed budget cuts (among other things, the plan also calls for zeroing out Americorps and family-planning funds, and it slashes the Environmental Protection Agency's budget), but it's getting big headlines because everybody has a television and a radio and nobody wants to see Scott Simon's children go hungry. In singling out CPB, Rogers and other House Republicans are initiating a familiar Washington ritual: the nine stages of not eliminating government broadcast funds. Stage 1. Scream and yell about an unacceptably liberal gesture by NPR or PBS. In this case that was the baseless firing of Juan Williams. In years past, it was PBS giving aid and comfort to Bill Moyers, Frontline, and Stanley Karnow. Stage 2. Threaten to eliminate the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which collects and distributes federal funds to public broadcasters. (See Gingrich, Newt, 1995.) Stage 3.   Introduce legislation to eliminate CPB. (See Crane, Phil, 1997.) Stage 4. Discover CPB's annual appropriation looms pretty small (currently $445 million) in a federal government whose annual spending is in the trillions. Stage 5. Discover that CPB, in a time-tested Washington trick, gives most of its money to local stations, which in turn give money to the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio. This (legal) money-laundering scheme makes congressional districts around the country consciously dependent on and loyal to CPB. Stage 6. Discover that NPR and PBS have developed a deep interest not merely in your conservative political views but in your entire Weltanschauung and put you on the air all the time. Stage 7. Discover that most public broadcasting officials, no matter what their politics, would rather die than be identified publicly with liberalism and will strangle overtly left-leaning content long before you hear about it. (See Allen, Woody, squelched Nixon parody, 1972.) Stage 8. Discover that despite their terror of anything that might be labeled left-wing propaganda, public broadcasters will, after remarkably little bullying, gladly broadcast more right-wing propaganda than even Grover Norquist can tolerate.

11	11	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/02/exceptionally_articulate.html	"President Obama does not treat all conspiracy theories alike. He dismisses those who question where he was born, but he's unsettled by those who question whether he is born again. At the National Prayer Breakfast last week, he said his Christian faith has sustained him through his presidency--""all the more so,"" he said, ""when Michelle and I hear our faith questioned."" Americans like their presidents to share their values, and religion is often a proxy for that connection. There has been at least some confusion about what Obama believes; in a recent poll, half of Americans said Obama holds religious values different from their own. Those who see the difference tend to view him unfavorably. Of the three prayer-breakfast speeches the president has given since coming to office, this was his most personal talk on faith. As Time's Michael Scherer pointed out, in 2009, Obama used the first-person pronoun I 15 times in his prayer-breakfast remarks. He used the first-person pronoun 10 times in 2010. Last week, he used it 44 times. It was hard not to see the political balancing act: He was trying to give the religious charge just enough credence to smash it to pieces. It is a strategy Obama will need to perfect as the 2012 election approaches as he faces a similar charge--""he just doesn't believe in it""--on such issues as ""American exceptionalism"" and capitalism itself. All of these issues represent inroads to a broader toxic argument against Obama that Hillary Clinton's chief strategist, Mark Penn, articulated in a strategy memo four years ago: ""I cannot imagine America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally American in his thinking and in his values."" Penn proposed targeting Obama's ""lack of American roots"" by wrapping Clinton almost literally in the flag. ""Let's explicitly own 'American' in our programs, the speeches and the values. He doesn't. Make this a new American Century, the American Strategic Energy fund"" What Penn wanted to do--without ever getting caught doing so--was raise the question in voter's minds: Is he one of us? At its most corrosive, this set of issues promotes the idea that the president isn't simply supporting the ""wrong"" policies but has the ""wrong"" beliefs. But Penn failed (spectacularly), so how potent is this mix now? It's big enough that the president had to address the religion element in his prayer breakfast. Sen. John McCain also addressed these issues when trying to make peace with Obama by defending him against the toughest conservative charge: ""He is a patriot sincerely intent on using his time in office to advance our country's cause. I reject accusations that his policies and beliefs make him unworthy to lead America or opposed to its founding ideals."" The size of the exposure may also be determined by which GOP candidates try to feed it. Is that what Mitt Romney was trying to do when he changed the subtitle of his book from No Apology: The Case for American Greatness to No Apology: Believe in America? It sounds right out of Penn's playbook. Romney's critique of the president is not just that Obama does not share American values but that Obama is intent on smothering them. Then again, as Romney allies say, maybe he is just trying to increase book sales. When Newt Gingrich suggests the president ""doesn't seem to have the kind of personality that allows normal Americans to get the rhythm of who he is,"" he is hitting on this theme. In his recent book he does it with a sledgehammer by suggesting Obama and the ""secular-socialist machine"" pose as great a threat to America as Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union. He has since moderated that charge but not its essential thrust. Even if he's not comparing the president to those two regimes, he's saying that he is so non-American that a person must stretch to find an analogy among the people who committed the greatest acts of human depravity. On Monday, the president addressed the Chamber of Commerce in the latest of a series of steps aimed at rebutting the idea that he does not believe in American commerce. It is the easiest of these values charges to rebut because the president has some control over policies that might help or hurt business. Opponents are likely to see Obama's prayer-breakfast speech or the American boosterism of his State of the Union address as insincere: He's just talking about these issues now because he's got an election coming. Such charges may have some power, especially if voters don't want to investigate them. But on the two big charges--that Obama doesn't believe in God, and doesn't believe in America--it's hard to make the case that the president has just discovered his faith or his voice in praising the American spirit. Obama is a Christian--as he likes to put it, he has ""a personal relationship with Jesus Christ."" You don't have to hunt for proof. His embrace of Christ is a key point in his 1995 autobiography. He has spoken throughout his career about his faith. In 2004, he gave an extensive interview on the topic. In 2006, he scolded his own party for shutting out religion and scolded himself for not always boasting about the Christian roots of his values. A Politico story written in the first year of his presidency said he referred more to Jesus than George W. Bush did. (In the face of this, those who still want to judge Obama an unbeliever should go read their Matthew.) It is also possible to find the same antecedents for the president's State of the Union address. When Obama spoke about America's history and the unique ability of Americans to shape their destiny, many saw it as an attempt to answer the charge that he did not believe in ""American exceptionalism."" That was certainly part of the pitch, but he didn't have to go to the library to hunt up the passages. Before Obama was facing the charge that he was not a believer in this brand of American bootstrapping, he was singing the identical song as a candidate. To Obama's strongest critics, his view of ""American exceptionalism"" will not be sufficient. But they're not the audience for Obama's suasion. The voters who may need convincing are the ones in the middle of the electorate, the ones who believed he shared their values even when Sarah Palin said he was ""palling around with terrorists."" It's the message the president gave in his interview with Fox's Bill O'Reilly. ""I'm the same guy."" Become a fan of  Slate and  John Dickerson on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

12	12	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/02/what_we_talk_about_when_we_talk_about_the_deficit.html	"Politicians in Washington like to talk about talking about the budget deficit. They acknowledge it. They emphasize the importance of talking about it. They suggest they have strong feelings about it. But when it comes to details, they get vague. Not since Bill Clinton's second term has there been a topic people talk about so much without wanting to be specific. On Wednesday, senior White House officials offered an example of this phenomenon. They held a briefing for reporters about the president's new energy initiative. Part of  his ""Win the Future"" campaign, there were the requisite new slogans. The ""Better Building Initiative"" sets goals for improvements in energy efficiency. ""Race to Green"" offers grants to state and local governments that make it easier to retrofit buildings to install energy-saving technology. But when asked how much it would all cost, there were no numbers. The Wall Street Journal's Laura Meckler asked why, since the president's budget--which will be released in two weeks--has been completed. The senior administration officials should know exactly how much the initiatives cost. After all, they are senior. There were three possible answers to her question: a) We are spending a lot and don't want criticism of how much we're spending to overshadow coverage of the president's exciting new initiative; b) We're spending very little and don't want the headline on the president's exciting new initiative to be ""Big Whoop""; or c) We really don't know because we're making this up. Meckler got d) No answer at all: ""There's a lot of information in the budget. It will be out in due course. There'll be plenty of details about these proposals and lots of other proposals when the budget actually comes out."" It was a phone briefing, but I imagined lots of waving of senior hands as this was being said. This is typical, and just one of the ways to stay unspecific about how to reduce the deficit that this year is estimated to be $1.5 trillion. Here are some other ways, ranked in rough order from most embarrassing to most courageous: Diet Tomorrow: Suggest new programs but don't say how you'll pay for them. Blue Ribbon Duck: Call for a commission to study the deficit, or entitlement spending, or whatever it is about the budget you don't want to talk about. Blue Ribbon Dodge: Call for a commission and when it offers suggestions, ignore them. (This is the president's present posture toward his deficit commission.) Spinach Some Day: Declare that pruning entitlements is necessary but suggest no way to do so. The Big Empty: Call for a balanced budget amendment or a spending cap, with no specifics about how to implement either. Fear: Say that any spending reductions beyond those you like will shut down the government. Lafferable: Declaring that the budget must be shrunk by spending cuts alone. Fish Story: Boast about tiny cuts that address only a fraction of the problem. YoungAdult: Support a tough deficit commission report even though you don't like some provisions. Sens. Dick Durbin and Tom Coburn did this. There is one man who likes to get specific about spending cuts. Rep. Paul Ryan, the House budget chairman, is the Kenneth Starr of budgets: When he gets specific about the deficit, even his allies wince. He's got a deficit reduction plan that few of his Republican colleagues will sign on to. The cuts are too big and the changes to programs like Medicare and Social Security are too politically potent. Democrats won't sign on because he doesn't account for lost revenue from tax cuts. (See above under Lafferable.) On Thursday, Ryan introduced a smaller version that he says is just the start of a programmatic attack on federal spending. He proposed a $74 billion discretionary reduction for this spending year, the largest single year cut in decades. It included a $16 billion cut in defense spending that Majority Leader Eric Cantor had been telegraphing for weeks. Ryan has company in his specificity. There are several bipartisan groups of lawmakers. My colleague David Weigel writes about Sens. Claire McCaskill and Bob Corker. Sens. Mark Warner and Saxby Chambliss are also trying to work out budget deficit proposals. There are even hints that the White House is trying to work out a quiet deal on entitlements with Republicans like the secret one they hatched with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on continuing the Bush tax cuts. In two weeks the president will offer his own budget, making the conversation more specific. Gauzy deficit talk will continue, of course. But it may turn out to be a lot like the deficit itself: In a few months, we might see a net reduction. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter."

13	13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/02/tea_party_democrats.html	"Since being re-elected to the Senate and re-elected as majority leader, Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., has made a couple of things clear. There will be no cuts to Social Security. A ban on earmarks, or even a moratorium, would ""take away power from the legislative branch,"" and it would be the ""wrong thing to do."" He has not been able to convince his fellow Democrats. President Obama's State of the Union speech included a pledge to veto any legislation that ""comes to my desk with earmarks inside,"" and some soft language about entitlements that, nonetheless, feinted at Social Security reform. These comments got less attention last week than Obama's ballast about a ""Sputnik moment"" or ways to ""win the future."" Unlike the buzzwords, these comments stuck. Last week, members of the Senate's Tea Party Caucus pointed to the State of the Union to argue, in the words of Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., that the president had been ""co-opted"" by the Tea Party. On Tuesday, Democrats finished the job. First, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., introduced a package of spending cuts more draconian than anything Reid, or Democrats, had agreed to. The ""Commitment to American Prosperity Act,"" co-sponsored by eight Republicans, would mandate that spending be driven down from 24.7 percent to 20.6 percent of GDP by 2021. To do so, it would authorize the Office of Management and Budget to ""make evenly distributed, simultaneous cuts throughout the federal budget."" Social Security, said McCaskill, would be ""on the table,"" ready for the kind of means testing that Democrats had rejected for decades. This was literally the opposite of what Reid had promised. ""Do I want Social Security to be there for my kids and my grandkids?"" said McCaskill in a press conference launching the bill, which is co-sponsored by Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. ""Absolutely. Will I fight like a tiger to make sure that we protect Social Security? I absolutely will. But should we be buying prescription drugs for Warren Buffett with federal tax dollars? Well, that's just nuts! I mean, seriously! Can we afford to be writing checks for multimillionaires' prescription drugs in this country? That's just silly.""* Reid spoke to reporters about two hours after McCaskill proposed this. ""I have said many times,"" he said, ""that I will do everything that I can in throwing my legislative body in front of any efforts to weaken Social Security. Social Security has not contributed one penny to the debt, and as I've said before, people should leave Social Security alone."" This was a good rebuttal, sort of. But just as Reid was saying this, the Senate Appropriations Committee announced that it would do the unthinkable and agree to a two-year ban on earmarks, the senatorial carve-outs of spending bills that had been, for decades, the reason for getting on these committees in the first place. ""I continue to support the constitutional right of members of Congress to direct investments to their states and districts under the fiscally responsible and transparent earmarking process that we have established,"" said appropriations Chairman Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, echoing Reid. Alas: ""Given the reality before us, it makes no sense to accept earmark requests that have no chance of being enacted into law."" Let's remember the context for all of this. Every week, or every day, some political observer looks at the Tea Party or the conservative movement and sees the stirring of a Republican civil war. Over the weekend, the New York Times sorted the tea leaves in Indiana, Maine, and Utah and reported that the movement was figuring out which Republicans to target and how to target them in 2012. That's a sideshow. The conventional wisdom back in November was that conservative activists had gone too far and cost their party enough seats to keep the Senate in Harry Reid's hands. (To be fair, the conventional wisdom transmitted from editorial pages and into the minds of Republicans like Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala.) Sure, a few Tea Party candidates blew it. They're settling; they're completely defining the agenda of the Democratic Senate. McCaskill's ""CAP Act"" is a prime example of how this works. Two weeks ago, the ultra-conservative Republican Study Committee released an ambitious plan to cut $2.5 trillion from the budget in 10 years, by forcing spending back down to the level it was in 2006. Democrats rejoiced; here was the GOP agreeing to the kind of ugly, job-killing cuts they'd previously decided not to get specific about. Then came the McCaskill-Corker proposal. The progressive-leaning Center on Budget Priorities scored the bill with the horror of a too-young tween reading an early Stephen King novel. ""Limiting spending to an historical average of some kind has been a longstanding goal of very conservative organizations such as the Heritage Foundation,"" wrote CBP's Paul Van de Water. ""Historical spending levels are not a realistic or appropriate goal for the future."" In another analysis, CBP's James Horney assessed that the CAP Act could slash $4.5 trillion from the budget, $2 trillion more than the RSC plan that Democrats had blanched at. Plenty of legislation gets introduced in the Senate and goes nowhere. The CAP Act might join those ghostly ranks. But it's co-sponsored by McCaskill, and that means something. Elected in a 2006 squeaker, she is on the ballot next year and polls within single digits of Republican challengers. She endorsed Barack Obama for president in January 2008, when he was the candidate of reasonable moderates, the sort of people who would later start No Labels. She voted for every Democratic priority of 2009 and 2010, despite occasionally voicing objections like this. Still, she's aligned herself with budget cuts and entitlement panic over the arguments of Harry Reid. Does this mean that Democrats will roll over when House Republicans hand over their budget? Not necessarily. They do enjoy campaigning against Budget Chairman Paul Ryan's long-term cuts. They know how to demagogue anything that goes after popular programs. There have to be limits, though. Some Tea Party leaders are convinced that Democrats are catering to them. Some Democrats are fulfilling demands, even if only in word, that those leaders have been making for years. Later this year, Senate Democrats will get the House's budget and try to restore funding for the president's priorities. Unless everyone forgets the way they've been talking about spending, that's going to be tricky. For a bunch of people who are allegedly fighting among themselves, Tea Partiers have become quite good at determining what Congress can get away with. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter.

14	14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/01/health_care_ruling_wtf.html	"President Obama has been on tour to promote his investment agenda with photo-ops (light fixtures!) and new slogans (""Startup America""). But last year's health care legislation is getting in his way. A federal district court judge declared the law unconstitutional on Monday, and Senate Republicans are pushing for a repeal vote. How do you win the future when you're stuck in the past? White House aides tried to dispatch the ruling with two arguments: First, this was just one of many rulings, and not all of them have been unfavorable. Second, the judge's weak ruling was politically motivated. The latter charge was based on what senior White House officials called his ""unconventional"" reasoning that relied as much on Tea Party propaganda as it did legal precedent. ""This much more politicized rhetoric takes up more space than you'd expect,"" said a senior White House official, which ""points to the weaknesses"" in the argument. The Justice Department will appeal the ruling and implementation of the law will continue. Next? This is a pretty standard response--nothing to see here--but it comes at a time when the White House is trying afresh to not let unplanned events knock it off its intended path. ""We were too prosaic,"" David Axelrod told Maureen Dowd as he reflected on the last two years. ""We all got sort of dragged down, you know; we were a triage unit. I think all of us have been guilty of neglecting that really important part of the presidency, where you're operating in the world of ideals and values and vision."" It's an open question whether the new approach Axelrod and other White House aides offer is even possible in the modern age. The in-box presidency has changed. Distractions are a constant. The twists and turns of health care in 2011 may offer the first challenge to this attempt at streamlining. The president says he doesn't want to relitigate the past, but he knows the health care issue must be managed, and in his State of the Union address he told Republicans he was open to tweaking the bill. It all sounds very prosaic. The issue might consume more of the president's time than he'd like because there are vulnerable Democrats in the Senate for whom the health care issue could be an ongoing source of heartburn. Within minutes after the ruling was announced, the National Republican Senatorial Committee issued press releases targeted at vulnerable Democrats Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Bill Nelson of Florida, who supported the constitutionality of the law. (Possible 2012 candidates were also trying to grab the moment. Mike Huckabee sent out an appeal with the subject line: ""Help Me Pressure the Senate to Repeal Obamacare."") On the day of the ruling, Sen. Jim DeMint, the South Carolina Republican, announced that all 47 Republican senators had signed on to his bill to repeal the health care law. Could he get any Democrats to sign on with him? Twenty-three Democrats face re-election in 2012. Five of those races are rated toss-ups which means control of the Senate is in play. One from that group, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, has said he would have voted against the bill. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, thinks the political environment might win him a few votes, perhaps on health care repeal. ""How many of the 23 Democrats who are up in '12 are going to start voting with us?"" he asked last week in an interview with Politico's Mike Allen. ""And maybe my number is not 47. Maybe it's 51. Or maybe it's 60. How many of the Democrats in the Senate who are up in '12 are still comfortable with all of the ways they voted in the previous Congress and may want to go in a different direction this Congress?"" McConnell might be delusional about the number of Democrats he can pressure into coming his way. Even if he does win a few converts, he isn't going to win a repeal fight. If the Senate does pass a repeal, the president will veto it. Then McConnell would have to find 67 votes. McConnell also knows, of course, that it's not strictly necessary to repeal the law to use it against vulnerable Democrats. To avoid the use of health care as a constant irritant against his fellow Democrats, the president might have to get working a little faster on those fixes he talked about in the State of the Union. By showing flexibility to tinker, Obama would help himself and vulnerable Democrats show that they are not blind to the law's flaws while allowing them to argue that there's much in the law worth saving. Tweak and keep rather than repeal and replace. If the president were to actively engage in making this case, it would distract from his ""new investment in the future"" message and ruin the White House's new plan not to get dragged into tactical fights. But it would also secure Democratic allies he'll need for other fights, such as on budget cuts and investments. To make his vision of the future a reality, Obama may have to spend some of the present dealing with his past. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter."

There are 10 of them, and they were among the first people to start camping out in the Capitol building. ""We were all lying down in the sleeping bags,"" says CJ Terrell, an unofficial spokesman for the cuddlers, ""and somebody said, 'They've got a cuddle puddle going on.' And we liked it."" ""We didn't know each other before this happened,"" says Tom Bird, like Terrell a University of Wisconsin grad student. ""Most of us met between 10 and two days ago,"" says Terrell. He and Bird became Facebook friends only this week. You can walk the halls 100 times and not lose your sense of wonder and amazement at the occupation of Wisconsin's state Capitol. It's hard to admit this without it sounding like an endorsement of the pro-labor, anti-Republican stance of the protesters. It's not. It's just that things like thisdon't ever happen in state capitols. Sure, there have been temporary sit-ins at state houses. There were scattered one-day sit-ins to protest the Iraq war. The graybeard liberals of Madison--this city does not lack for them--remember sit-ins to build pressure for a nuclear weapons ban, and against the Vietnam War. But those aren't the same thing as a 10-day sit-in of a public building, fueled by donations from thankful liberals in other states, peopled by union workers and college students who have built a little commune on marble. They film themselves and upload the videos to YouTube, and they are constantly in front of cameras gathering footage for news or for exposes by the conservative MacIver Institute. How'd it happen? Because it's legal to sleep in the Capitol if hearings are going on and because the minority Democrats started hearings last week. Since Monday, police have tightened up access to the Capitol. Instead of every door to the building being open, only two are. All four wings had unrestricted access; two do now. Starting on Saturday, Senate offices--some of which had been used to house protesters for sleeping or strategizing--will be closed to anyone who's not a senator. Thus the little village protesters have built will be disrupted, perhaps even disbanded. It's got to happen sometime. Before it does, I decided to spend a night with the micro-commune. My night happened to coincide with the night that Republicans pushed the Budget Repair Bill through the Assembly, and the striking thing was how little changed after that happened. 6:28 p.m.: Gov. Scott Walker's press conference ends with no real news. The hallway outside his office is lined with letters collected by MoveOn.org from Wisconsinites, pleading with Walker to cave. A sign says the group has 10,000 or so letters. Down the stairwell, on the second-floor atrium, a crowd has parted for a nine-piece funk fusion group called VO5, which is performing an original song tentatively called ""Wisconsin (Cheddar Revolution)."" Bandleader Andrew Rohn is still thinking about where to put the parentheses. It's an old song he has repurposed with new protest-specific lyrics. You think you'll beat us, we're gonna lay down and die?Screw us and we multiply! 6:55 p.m.: Parts of the second floor have been closed off, but protesters have complete control of the area around Office 116N. On the left: A table for medical supplies, crowded with aspirin, band-aids, feminine hygiene products, and so on. There are no photos allowed, and volunteers are told to give a ""press release,"" hand-written on notebook paper, to anyone who asks questions; it just confirms that the supplies are dropped off by Samaritans who ask what's needed. On the right: Two tables of foodstuffs, with supplies that dwindle and change quickly. At the moment, they include a Tupperware container of chocolate chip cookies, a tub of peanut butter that a volunteer describes as ""various peanut butters working together in solidarity for the cause of deliciousness,"" regular bread and gluten-free bread, tart candies, and piles of bagels. The food is paid for by donations; volunteers buy it and serve it, as well as remind people to use the hand sanitizer nearby liberally. In the center: a ""family area."" It's a safe space with no cameras allowed, where children frolic, play with communal toys, or rest on yoga mats. I'm bonked in the head painlessly by a ball tossed by a child being watched by Trina Clemente. ""I'm a student right now,"" she says, ""because there are no jobs."" 7:23 p.m.: Ryan Henry, a construction worker from Baltimore, stands in a first-floor hallway singing original songs with a kind of Bob Dylan or Fred Neil lilt. Tea Party on the Capitol lawnAnd Sarah Palin, singing alongLaughing all the way to the Pentagon The song is drowned out at times by the sound of a whistle being blown by Drake Singleton, who's drawing attention to his silk-screened T-shirts commemorating the sit-in. 7:44 p.m.: Dane Spudnik, who works at the Willy Street co-op in town, is manning the anarchist lending library set up next to a stairwell. He doesn't mind if people make off with the ""Capitalism is Doomed"" posters or ""Organizing in the Workplace"" guides, but he wants to make sure ""nobody sees this copy of  The Shock Doctrine and says, oh, I can sell that for $5."" 8:27 p.m.: The ""War Room"" of the Teaching Assistants Association is tucked away on the third floor. The walls are lined with donated coffee, take-out containers, cereal, and charts--lots and lots of charts, to sign up for cleaning duties or to pick up a bright-green vest and act as a marshal. The room itself is about to be closed down on Saturday, a casualty of the Senate's tightened security. ""That's been our Situation Room,"" says one graduate student, Ben Stein, a little glumly. ""We organized everything from there and I don't think we could have put together any of this without that room. Now that we have, I think we can keep it going, but--that was a nice room!"" Rep. Tammy Baldwin, who represents Madison, is in the Sit Room talking to some students. Other students are grading papers or calling people in for shifts. ""I asked them what they needed,"" says Baldwin, ""and they said they needed air mattresses."" She points to the inflatable mattresses she just delivered, which will be deployed within hours. 8:43 p.m.: The TAA offers to let me do a round of trash clean-up. After a moment's hesitation, my journalistic instinct takes over: Collecting trash would give me exclusive access to a whole new part of the commune. I grab plastic gloves and a bag, and start downstairs. My ethical qualms vanish when Diane Blum, a secretary at a nearby school, demands to carry the trash bag. So: The trash pickup, which has kept the Capitol remarkably clean, has two components. The usual Capitol custodians do clean-up on regular hours; the TAA does regular runs around the building, putting their trash bags next to trash cans, per an agreement with the custodial staff. There has been very little damage to the building. Once protesters were warned that taping signs everywhere might damage the property, they switched to blue electrical tape. Once protesters realized that some people were writing unkind things on the Scott-brand toilet paper containers in bathrooms, signs went up warning against this. The scribbling stopped. 9:14 p.m.: Protesters who'll sleep in the Capitol are starting to settle in. The protesters who can't are heading out. George Boulamatis, a corrections officer in Racine, has to leave for a 10:30-6:30 shift, but he listens to an ad hoc string band play folk songs before he goes. 9:50 p.m.: The debate in the Assembly is dragging on. Republicans sit as still and look as alert as they can. Rep. Dave Cullen is on the floor, and he sounds like a tape slowed down on the reel as he hammers Scott Walker over his conversation with a phony ""David Koch."" ""That's one of our quietest members on the floor right now,"" says Rep. Chris Danou. ""We can keep going for a long time. One of my fellow representatives was telling me he has three hours of labor history to talk about."" A lot of Democratic members are talking about the Kochs; when they do, they often get boisterous cheers from the second floor of the Capitol, where the proceedings are audible. 10:31 p.m.: League of Conservation Voters organizer Matt Dannenberg was listening to the speakers playing the Assembly debate. He's one of the first people to notice that Republicans have made an end-run around the Democratic filibuster and are about to force a vote. ""Get people over here!"" he says, swinging his arm toward the Assembly. ""This is not democracy! This is not democracy! Come on, we need more people!"" Protesters jump off of their mats and bedrolls and run toward the police tape blocking them from the Assembly. A heavyset trumpet player is allowed to the very front of the crowd; screams and chants get intermingled with smooth jazz. A Democratic staffer emerges from the chamber and waves his arms in a ""raise the roof""-type gesture. 11:20 p.m.: The protesters calm down a bit. One sign around the Capitol says, explicitly, ""The Assembly Will Pass The Bill, We Need to Focus on the Senate."" So there's a sense of resignation at a vote that was always going to go against them. Kristina Nielsen, a UW student wearing her mother's AFT shirt, knits a solidarity bracelet and talks about staying even after the bill passes. ""We've been here 10 days and I'm starting to get used to the marble floor,"" she says. ""It actually helps that we're more exhausted."" What about the constant noise? ""It's fine. It's like living in a dorm."" 1:01 a.m.: The Assembly debate dragged on for hours after Republicans started to force the vote--by now, it's been going on for more than 60 hours, and Republicans are fed up. ""Everything that's being said has been said three or four times already,"" said Speaker Pro Tem Bill Kramer. ""Until seven minutes ago, no one was listening. Except me."" Minutes later, Kramer gavels in a quick vote. Democrats explode, furious not just at the result but at the fact that the vote lasted less than 15 seconds. They start to file out of the chamber, and one by one they go to a railing and wave to the hundreds of people crammed onto the floor below. Rep. Leon Young tosses his orange T-shirt into the crowd; a protester grabs it as if Eddie Van Halen has tossed a guitar pick. ""This is a travesty!"" says Rep. Bill Hulsey, who'd yelled, ""Shame"" at Republicans louder than almost anyone. ""What do I want to do next? I don't even want to say."" He joins his colleagues in a caucus meeting. 1:20 a.m.: In the first-floor atrium, Rep. Cory Mason joins the Cuddle Puddle, who have a megaphone at the ready, and thanks the protesters. ""I've never been so glad that we have two chambers,"" he says. In the other chamber, of course, striking Senate Democrats are not present for a vote, so the bill is stuck. The megaphone is passed to Damon Terrell, CJ's brother. He's wearing a cut-off shirt that displays a fresh tattoo, a fist in the shape of Wisconsin with ""SOLIDARITY"" written alongside. ""For the first time in my life,"" he says, ""I know I am doing what I was born to do."" Reporters try to talk to Terrell, but he gives them a little information before holding up. ""I really want to be in the moment now,"" he says. He returns to the circle for hugs. 2:14 a.m.: Every night there's a rumor that the Capitol will be cleared. It's not being cleared tonight. Some protesters are sitting up straight; some seem to have slept through the apocalypse. ""How can you sleep?"" says Mary McDonald, a representative of AFT Healthcare in Washington. ""It's so dramatic! It's so upsetting! How can these people possibly work together now, you know? There have been so many double-crosses."" 7:45 a.m.: The doors to the Capitol are about to open again, and before they do I take a quick survey of the feeding/sleeping areas. Some of the sleepers, roused, are doing TV interviews through heavy eyelids. The food has been replenished, with stacks of bagels and cream cheese in the breakfast nook. (There's no fresh coffee just yet.) There are rumors, as there are every day, that the Capitol will be closed to protesters, but there's a massive rally planned for Saturday. Tom Bird, the first of the Cuddle Puddle to wake up, stops me and speaks happily about the sleep he managed to get, after Democratic staffers left and handed him and other protesters the cold remainders of their Ian's Pizza. ""I had to sleep,"" he says, ""because this is going to be a big weekend."" Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

16	16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/02/all_in_the_family.html	"Mike Huckabee starts his new book A Simple Government by talking about the family. Its health is not just a moral requirement for a stable society, he writes, but an economic one. He says there is a $300 billion ""Dad deficit"" because fathers do not care for their children. Two-thirds of the children who live in poverty wouldn't be in poverty, he writes, if their parents were married. The message from the Republican Party lately has mostly been about reducing spending and cutting the budget. Huckabee wants that conversation expanded. ""I wanted to stake out a position and say: 'Please don't tell me that social conservatism is irrelevant. It is connected to economic conservatism.' "" With such a focus on the family, he was upset at the president's decision on Wednesday not to defend the Defense of Marriage Act in court. He sees the decision as a shift to a broader support for gay marriage (which Obama still does not support). ""He himself didn't take this position when he ran for president,"" Huckabee told me in an interview. ""I think if he had, he wouldn't be president. ... I don't think the president sits down and says. 'Hmm, let's destroy the family.' I mean, I don't think that. I think he thinks he's either got to do this for political reasons or maybe he really believes it--I don't know. But I do know there is a definite economic impact of the breakup of families in this country,"" he says. ""One decision isn't going to destroy the family, the family's pretty strong. It may destroy him, may destroy his credibility, may destroy his campaign and candidacy and ultimately his term in office."" In polls of possible Republican presidential candidates, Huckabee is tied for the lead. In a recent Gallup poll his standing has been improving. But unlike Mitt Romney or Tim Pawlenty, who are neck deep in the presidential swim but just won't admit it, Huckabee appears at times to be on dry land clutching his towel. ""Someone said, 'He acts like he doesn't want to run,' "" he said. ""I would put it this way: I don't want to lose."" On the one hand Huckabee has embarked on a 41-city tour to sell his book. Such a tour is a prerequisite for any presidential campaign. He also sounds like a candidate when he says things like this: ""Social conservatives are economic conservatives. Not all economic conservatives would call themselves social conservatives. Those of us who can deliver the whole package are the most conservative because we don't limit it to the very rigid economic issues."" Later he boasts about governors as the only kinds of politicians with complete experience. And lest that be interpreted as a boost for one of the other governors running, Huckabee says he doesn't yet see anyone in the race who sufficiently fits the bill. On the other hand, he frets about the costs of running for office. He's been through it before, he says, and he knows how brutal it is. He wants to know before he starts that he can win, and that there is a market for his ideas. He doesn't just want nods of assent. He wants money. ""If I run, I walk away from a pretty good income, so I don't want to walk away any sooner than I have to,"" he says. ""I don't have a lot of reserve built up. Most of my life has been in public service. ... One thing I committed to myself, my wife, and to God is if I'm going to do this, I'm hopefully going to be in a position that I'm not going to be completely destitute by the end of it. I have no idea what to do if I get sick or retire or have a disability."" Even the jokes he makes hint at his financial concerns. Asked if he's ever talked to the Koch brothers, who have long funded conservative causes, he says no--but ""if they want to call and help set up a fundraising network, I'd like that."" Later, as he flips easily through his iPhone 4, he jokes that he could turn his affection for Apple products into an ad campaign that might fund his run. ""Once you go Mac you never go back,"" he says, as if trying out for the role. For someone so concerned about money, as Politico's Jonathan Martin has pointed out, Huckabee has not done the early work necessary to build a fundraising network. (That would limit his personal income because it would mean he'd have to step down from his job at Fox News.) His plan seems to be simple: If you publish it, they will come. ""I want to see if these ideas resonate with people. If you don't have ideas that resonate with people that you're going to ask to give money to your campaign, and vote for you, maybe it's not your time."" This ""listening to the people"" theme brings him back to the deficiencies of the current occupant of the White House. The president's decision on DOMA was the latest in what Huckabee sees as a refusal to listen to voters. ""What does the president believe he knows that the citizens of these states don't?"" he asked, referring to the 33 states in which voters have voted not to support same sex marriage. It's a common Republican complaint about the president's hubris. Later, Huckabee praised fellow Arkansan Bill Clinton for listening to the people and the opposition. Huckabee wasn't completely anti-Obama. He made a full defense of Michelle Obama's anti-obesity campaign. ""I think her approach is the right one. She is not advocating that the government take over our dinner plates. She's been criticized unfairly by fellow conservatives out of a reflex rather than thoughtful expression."" The program, he says, ""is exactly what Republicans say they believe. You put a focus on personal responsibility, you encourage people to make good choices, and you encourage them for doing so."" Huckabee is a defender of the first lady's campaign in part because he pushed his own anti-obesity campaign as governor. He famously lost 100 pounds before his last run. He's a little less trim than he was during the 2008 primaries--perhaps another sign that his body language is leaning against a run.Watch John Dickerson's interview with Mike Huckabee.

17	17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/02/lets_make_a_secret_deal.html	"The only way President Obama and congressional Republicans may get a budget deal is if they make it look like it will never happen. The president said as much last week. ""Both sides will have to do some posturing and speak to constituencies and rally the troops,"" he said. But he also expressed faith ""that there will be a reasonable and responsible and toned-down conversation."" The difference between the two kinds of communications is the difference between what's said in the negotiating room and what's said in front of the microphones. Bash them in public, work with them in private: That's the operating principle, but as both the president and House Speaker John Boehner have demonstrated, narrowcasting to your base is difficult in the hypernews environment where your words can get away from you. The best illustration of the two-track conversation came last year during the negotiations over extending the Bush-era tax cuts. On Dec. 4, 2010, Vice President Joe Biden gave the White House radio address while the president was visiting the troops in Afghanistan. He criticized Republicans for their push to deny benefits to the unemployed and raise taxes on the middle class. He suggested it was un-American and not in keeping with the spirit of the holiday season. The GOP wasn't actually pushing to raise taxes on the middle class, of course. Biden was distorting their position to pressure them. The GOP was doing the same thing to the president. The rhetoric wasn't toxic, but neither did it suggest that a deal was near. Two days later, a deal would be announced. Biden was one of its authors. He'd been involved in secret negotiating for weeks with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Throughout the process, say White House aides, Boehner and McConnell acted in good faith. In public, though, the White House was portraying them as heartless. Bash-and-deal is a pretty good model for budget negotiations, says the president. He was also encouraged to operate this way by Jack Lew, his OMB director, who was in the Clinton White House during the last government shutdown. Lew's advice was that the minute you start putting grand and specific deficit ideas on the table in public, you immediately foreclose options you might need to embrace in a final deal. The downside of carrying on two conversations is that the things you say for public consumption might disrupt your private work. In a seemingly bipartisan effort to prove this point, the president and speaker simultaneously lost control of efforts to deliver messages to specific constituencies in recent days. The president tried to deliver a calibrated statement about the budget fight in Wisconsin. In times of austerity, he said, everyone had to sacrifice, including the public sector unions, but Gov. Scott Walker's efforts looked like overreach that disproportionately targeted unions. A Democratic president must support the union cause, but he tried to respond ""in stride,"" as one White House official put it, which is to say that he didn't run out of his way to comment on the issue, nor would he do so again. He certainly was not going to make good on his promise during the campaign: ""If American workers are being denied their right to organize when I'm in the White House, I will put on a comfortable pair of shoes and I will walk on that picket line with you as president of the United States."" The White House didn't want to say more for two reasons. As with the protests in the Middle East, it's better for Obama's long-term interests if the revolt in Wisconsin is seen as a thoroughly grassroots uprising. More important, speaking out also breaks the new White House rules about discipline. The goal is to have the president stay focused on his message about improving American competitiveness--avoiding each fracas over a budget line item or other news of the day. The attempt to send a discreet message failed. Republicans pounced on Obama's meddling. Boehner said the president was trying to ""demagogue"" the Wisconsin governor. Boehner knows something about losing message control. For weeks Democrats have predicted Republicans would be inflexible in their budget demands and shut down the government. The hope has been to cow them into compromise by reminding voters of the shutdown in 1995, which, it is widely believed, marked the start of Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich's downfall. Boehner and GOP leaders have been clear that's not what they want. Yet with two weeks to go before funding for the government runs out, Boehner said he would not support a bill to extend government funding that did not have spending cuts in it. It seemed like a threat to shut down government operations unless he got what he wanted. The week was supposed to end on a high note. Boehner had broken with past practice and allowed lawmakers of both parties to participate in a free-flowing legislative process. The result had been GOP-sponsored cuts of $60 billion, in partial fulfillment of one of their campaign promises. That message was clouded, however, with renewed talk of a government shutdown. That emboldened Democrats--and it emboldened Republican freshmen in the House, who are anxious to take every measure necessary to keep shrinking the size of government. But Boehner and GOP leaders don't want to shut down the government and thus risk seeming reckless. (Unlike the governor of Wisconsin, they don't have majorities throughout the government, which makes brinksmanship easier.) To cool down the troops, GOP leaders held a meeting late last week with most of the 87 freshmen members. ""We are not about shutting down the government,"" said Majority Leader Eric Cantor. That's a message they want heard inside the room and out. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter."	Government shutdown?

18	18	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/02/the_cheddar_revolution.html	"MADISON, Wisc.--The drums are everywhere, and they are very loud. In the well of the state capitol, which has been occupied by pro-union protestors for a week, drummers beat rhythms in between the speeches delivered by whoever queues up for the megaphone. These speeches are occasionally drowned out by louder drums, played by younger and noisier protesters who are marching in circles. The drummers need something else to do. A young man wearing a Green Bay Packers helmet takes the megaphone and hands them an assignment: Go bother the governor. ""I'm going to go up to Scott Walker's office,"" he says. ""A lot of people have gone up to the hallway outside of Scott Walker's office a few times, and they've brought their small kids, or perhaps they're small themselves. If you have 1,000 people in a small hallway it's not a safe environment. I want all the biggest, burliest union men to join me and I want us to be the front flank of people who march up to his office."" He mostly gets his wish. Hundreds of protesters surge slowly toward the room where Walker is addressing the media about his union-crimping ""budget repair bill,"" the legislation that started this mess. They were supposed to start at a bust of legendary progressive Republican Senator Robert LaFollette--there are now flowers and a sign reading ""What would Bob do?"" on the bust--but the crowd gets much closer to the room than anyone expected it to. The drums come out. One is a massive leather drum, like a prop from some docudrama about Genghis Khan. One drummer beats a red bucket so hard that the wooden spoon he was using splits in two. He shrugs and hits the bucket with the bigger half of the ex-spoon. There are louder noises than the ones coming from the drums. Organizers are leading chants of ""We are Wisconsin"" and ""Tell the truth,"" which sound louder as the space gets more crowded. Every once in a while they hush the crowd--this is done by asking and by getting members of the crowd to make peace signs with their hands--and order a new, louder action. They tell people to stomp their feet and shake the floors. ""Do it until you can't stand up!"" They do it, joined by the blowing of a green vuvuzela, stamped with a sticker from the Madison Teachers Association. No one is questioned, much less arrested. In Madison, the protesters are allowed to do almost anything. The police are watchful and bemused; during the foot-stomping, for example, Sgt. Brian Aubrey, who has been here for four days with capitol police, holds up his iPhone and takes a short video, then goes back to watching the crowd. This occupation of the capitol is totally legal. During the legislative session, anyone can enter the building, from morning to midnight, without going through a security gate. In addition, police unions in Madison and Dane County oppose the governor's bill and back the protest, even though they are exempted from the legislation's ban on collective bargaining. ""Why do we deserve collective bargaining rights if no one else gets them?"" asks Steve Heimsness, treasurer of the Madison Professional Police Officers Association, right after marching into the capitol with a ""Cops for Labor"" sign. ""Also, if the collective bargaining rights are taken away from the other workers, it'll happen to us. Guaranteed. I'm sure of it."" So there's no hurry to clean up the hundreds of small signs taped to the walls--several of them remind the crowd that ""This is a PEACEFUL protest""--or the larger ones that have been taped there for days. They cover letters spelling out ""We Are Wisconsin,"" visible from most parts of the building, and the massive banner on the second floor asking Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert to come to Madison because ""we came to your rally."" No one is telling the people who are sitting on sleeping bags, where they intend to spend the night, to go home. Sheryl Labash, who drove to Madison from Detroit on Thursday, has carved out a little section of a hallway on the second floor, where she reads the Socialist Worker online as she charges her BlackBerry. Not far away, another protester is taking the time to nap, happily earplugged against the din of hundreds of screaming comrades. The drum lines and the out-of-state sleepovers are a relatively new part of the protest. They were probably inevitable. One reason why Madison is a tricky place to start a Republican crackdown on union power is that it's home to a sprawling university and all manner of left-wing organizations, magnets for Midwest liberal activism. The Grassroots Leadership College, based here, is using the occasion to hold Nonviolent Demonstration Trainings around the clock, sharing tips like ""Don't make sudden moves around the police"" and ""Write the ACLU's phone number on your body"" (for when you're arrested and your phone is taken). Ian's Pizza, a restaurant close to the Capitol, has been delivering an endless supply of free food paid for by donors from around the world; the leftover boxes are immediately turned into makeshift protest signs. There's free coffee and water, and on some days free bratwurst, all from local shops. The hardiest protesters, the ones who have been on strike--a teacher's strike ends tomorrow--say they feel they are doing something worthwhile. Alyson Pohlman, who works for the university, walks in and out of the capitol building with one of the 12 signs she's made over seven days of protests. If the budget repair bill passes, she calculates that she'll make 14 percent less than she used to. But this concerns her less than the cause she is supporting, which she describes as ensuring that ""the voice of the people"" remains strong enough to speak out against corporate America. A lot of the protesters talk like this. They don't want to lose bargaining rights, but they couch that worry in a broader, more existential fear: What if they're losing their country? It is almost impossible not to hear echoes of Tea Party protesters. (There are some common slogans: I spotted one ""Mad as Hell"" and one ""Can You Hear Us Now?"" sign.) The Tea Party worries about George Soros and ACORN; the Cheddar Revolutionaries worry about libertarian billionaires Charles and David Koch, and an overall Republican strategy to ""defund the left."" They cite New Yorker and New York Times reports to make this case, and they're scared. There are countless signs attacking the Kochs, or Walker as a ""Koch tool,"" or listing which products to boycott in order to hit the Kochs' pocketbooks. And there are detailed charts explaining that if unions are neutered politically, the biggest campaign donors in America will be ""right-wing."" Mark Jansen, who drove to the protests from Indiana, walks the capitol with a yellow umbrella that came free with some Eggo waffles, and is now festooned with anti-Koch, anti-Citizens United slogans. ""Walker's a pink, naked purse dog for the Kochs!"" he says. Late in the evening, long after Walker's presser has ended, the drummers are still in the capitol. Other protesters are settling in for sleep. The rumor of the moment is that the state will find a way to expel them from the building. This rumor has cropped up from time to time, and it survives because there is a readiness, if not willingness, to expect the worst. ""This is Normandy,"" says Brian Austin, one of the protesting Madison police officers, heading home for the night. ""If we lose this, everything changes.""

First, the party tried to win a supermajority vote on extending the Patriot Act. Had they won, extension would have moved ahead with no amendments. But they fell short by seven votes, with a coalition of eight new GOP freshmen (some with Tea Party ties), some old libertarian bulls (like Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas), and a majority of Democrats voting against them. They got the votes for the Patriot Act on Monday, and they passed it. That led right into their next struggle--trimming spending with a series of more than 400 amendments. Because the new Republican leadership committed to an open rule, they had to let all of these amendments --most of them doomed efforts to save spending, proposed by Democrats--come to the floor for votes. None of this is really setting back the GOP's agenda. (Patriot Act reform wasn't even on the minds of most Tea Party freshmen, most of whom backed extension.) The House is on track to cut from $77 billion to $100 billion compared to the White House's original requests. For that reason, the Meter rises to 41. What Is the Don't-Tread-on-Meter?It will track the progress (or lack thereof) of the Republican House of Representatives, and the Republican conference in the Senate, in fulfilling the promises they made to Tea Party activists.

21	21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/02/why_are_we_doing_this_again.html	"Before President Obama's news conference Tuesday, he met with his predecessor George H.W. Bush. They could have traded war stories about budget fights. Obama was about to talk about the one he was starting. The 41st president could have talked about the fights that finished him politically. Or he could have offered a warning based on a question he received at a town hall debate during the 1992 campaign. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Ross Perot had been squabbling about how to reduce the deficit and debt. A woman stood up and asked how the debt affected each of them. Bush famously flubbed the question, seeming a few fairways away from regular Americans in his response. But the question was as revealing as Bush's out-of-touch answer. The woman didn't understand how the debt affected the lives of Americans and why she should care. Politicians haven't gotten better at delivering this message to people. Why do we have to reduce the deficit? And do we have to do it quickly? How will a smaller deficit improve the life of the average citizen? It's an assumption of the current debate that these questions have already been answered. Politicians have jumped ahead to stage two of the debate: the competition over who can do more deficit-reducing. But both parties should go back to square one: Here's why we need to do it in the first place. The party that wins the political battle will be the one that makes this case most clearly to the public, because if people buy the diagnosis they'll be more likely to buy the prescription. The policy proposal that wins the day will be the one that most clearly ties deficit reduction to the health of the economy, the issue people really care about. Agreement among politicians in Washington that cutting the deficit is important approaches 100 percent. What they fight about is how much and when. Out in the country the view is more muddled. People understand that it's bad for government to owe so much but how urgent of an issue is it for them? There doesn't seem to be a visceral feeling that cutting the deficit will affect the thing people care about most: jobs. In a recent CBS poll, 47 percent of respondents said they believed that reducing the deficit would improve the economy. 13 percent said it wouldn't or wouldn't make a difference. 38 percent weren't sure enough to give an answer. Even for those who think reducing the deficit will improve their ability to get a job or keep one, it's not clear they think it is the most important thing that can be done. When voters are asked what they most want Washington politicians to focus on, shrinking the deficit was not in the top five. They say ""jobs"" or ""the economy."" President Obama tried to connect deficit reduction to the everyday lives of Americans in his state of the union address. The world has changed, he argued. For people to live the American dream, they have to adapt to the changing economy. To help, he is offering a plan that includes investments in infrastructure, education, energy efficiency, and deficit reduction. He didn't exactly establish why deficit reduction would help people adapt to a changing economy, but by including it in the larger pitch he at least put it in a jobs-related framework. In today's news conference, that cluster of concepts was mostly shortened to the ever-more regrettable slogan, ""Win the future."" The deficit to jobs link was not made. The White House commissioned a ""White House White Board"" video to explain the president's budget with Jack Lew, the administration's budget chief, playing professor. There was no discussion of why the cuts he was talking about need to be made. It was essentially spin in the guise of instruction, offering graphs to show that Obama is tackling this problem that everyone says is so important. Lew also wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times. ""We cannot win the future, expand the economy and spur job creation if we are saddled with increasingly growing deficits,"" he said. Great. Why? Perhaps in the end this uncertainty among the electorate helps the president, whose deficit-reduction goals are more modest than those of Republicans in Congress. People may be for deficit reduction without being as gung-ho as the GOP is. They'll naturally embrace Obama's milder approach. Republicans are making the opposite bet. Even if people don't understand the connection between jobs and the deficit they want to see leadership, which to Republicans means big spending cuts. Tuesday afternoon they doubled down on this theory, announcing that the GOP budget will include the entitlement reform the president has been so shy about. To get the public behind all of this, Republicans are going to have to do a better job at explaining why these big cuts are necessary, and necessary at the pace the GOP is prescribing. John Boehner keeps asserting that deficits are causing business uncertainty, which keeps them from hiring or investing, but his explanation stops there. When pressed, he submits a letter from economists saying that the deficit must be reduced. At Obama's news conference, the president faced several questions about why he wasn't presenting a plan for managing entitlements. His answer was that conditions need to be right to tackle the big budget issues and that this won't happen unless Republicans are on board with the idea from the start. ""If you look at the history of how these deals get done, typically it's not because there's an Obama plan out there; it's because Democrats and Republicans are both committed to tackling this issue in a serious way."" This response offered more support to the idea that the only real work that's going to get done on the budget will be through some largely secret process. That's how he worked out a deal on extending the Bush tax cuts last year. In his news conference today Obama referred to that closed-door process about five times as a template for tackling the budget deficit. ""I will probably not give you a play-by-play of every negotiation that takes place,"" he said later, about the kind of grand deal he was envisioning. He expects that, as with the tax deal last year, negotiations will proceed on two tracks, a private one and a cartoon one for public consumption. ""I expect that both sides will have to do some posturing and speak to constituencies and rally the troops but that there will be a reasonable and responsible and toned down conversation."" (On cue, after the press conference in which Obama said both parties needed to come together, the president threatened to veto the House GOP continuing resolution.) One key to pulling off a secret negotiation is enduring the weeks of abuse that will come from those who charge that he isn't leading on this tough issue. Republicans are already doing so. Pundits are too. It's true, to a point. While Obama may not be making an enormous public push on entitlements at the moment, he can hardly be scored as a leadership weakling when it comes to taking action to reduce long term entitlement costs. That was one of the driving motivations behind health care reform, an issue he championed for months and one that contributed to big electoral losses by his party. ""If we don't do something soon to rein in health care costs,"" Medicare and Medicaid ""will consume all of the federal budget,"" the president said in a typical remark from the beginning of his health care push in June 2009. He was criticized for focusing too closely on the green eyeshade aspects of health care reform, of talking too much about the deficit-reducing benefits of ""bending the cost curve."" Critics said he needed to spend more time discussing the elements of the bill that would help regular people. Once again Obama faces the problem of explaining to people how all of these numbers flying by them and all the jargon about discretionary this and sustainable that matter to their lives. At least this time, Republicans are in the same bind. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter."

22	22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/02/assume_a_budget_summit.html	"President Obama delivered his budget today. The opposing party denounced it immediately. This is the tradition. Imagine if it applied to other Washington rituals: When House Speaker John Boehner paused after taking the gavel from former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrats could yell, ""Resign!"" After Obama finished his inaugural address on the steps of the Capitol, congressional leaders could have headed inside to start impeachment proceedings. In this budget tradition, after the denunciation comes the wrangling. Party leaders took shots at each other in conference calls and press conferences, trying to shape the budget process that will play out over the next few months. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said the Republican budget was ""slash and burn."" Though Obama had proposed steep cuts in discretionary spending that his liberal allies rejected, Republican Majority Leader Eric Cantor said the president had failed to lead. But this familiar theater was more irritating than usual this year. Both the president and GOP leaders had promised that they would start talking about the choices required to keep the budget deficit from growing out of control. If we restructure entitlements and streamline the tax code now, the argument went, we won't have to make emergency drastic moves in the future. We were supposed to have the adult conversation in 2011 (year of the owl in the Chinese budget calendar). Instead, we have year of the duck. The dreary public conversation so far has been about a small, 15 percent portion of the budget. (On this budget chart  hit the ""isolate discretionary spending"" What's left is small terrain of today's budget fight.) But what if this isn't the predictable race to the puny that we've come to expect? What if the president and GOP leaders are being adults behind the scenes (or at least trying to be)? It would be the smartest way to get anything done. It would keep the entitlement conversation from getting hijacked, and it would build on the model for interaction that helped bring about the agreement last year with Republicans on extending the Bush tax cuts. In that battle, the president put Joe Biden in a room with Mitch McConnell to work out a deal. There was also a public process--meetings of a gang of noble senators and White House officials--but the real work was being done in private. Once the details had been arranged, the president presented the deal publicly and worked hard to push it the final short stretch until it became law. McConnell has been encouraging secret talks on a serious deficit plan. ""If we're going to do anything serious about entitlements, we're not going to negotiate it in public,"" McConnell told Politico's Mike Allen in a recent interview. ""I don't necessarily conclude from the absence of any real discussion of entitlement reform that the president is not interested."" McConnell and the president had a private lunch recently that never made it on to Obama's official schedule. A GOP leadership aide says they are hopeful this route will produce some fruit. White House officials brush off the idea in a way that doesn't reveal much of their thinking. There are obvious differences between the tax-cut deal and an agreement on the big deficit issues. Last year both sides agreed to give each other what they wanted: Republicans got the upper-income tax cuts and Democrats got spending to help the unemployed and low-income workers. Instead of splitting the baby, they decided to have twins. This time, though, both sides will have to decide on how to apportion out the pain of a smaller budget. The degree of difficulty makes secret negotiations even more a requirement. Lawmakers have to be able to offer ideas in good faith without having interest groups and pundits react with outrage at each little peep. If the president isn't working something behind the scenes, he is falling short of the kind of leadership he promised. As it stands, his future-oriented agenda asks us to win the future by investing in programs like wireless Internet, high-speed rail and education. These things won't pay off for a while. In the meantime, he's calling on cuts that will hurt immediately. But a focus on the future makes no sense without a focus on the future problems of the deficit. No one will win the future if we don't spend some time in the present addressing the deficit. Republicans are falling short, too. They boast about the past election being an affirmation of their message that government has grown too large. They boast about how they were unified against a popular president and followed their small-government principles. But now they want Obama to lead when it comes to tackling entitlements? This is not a new failing of courage. When George Bush tried to reform Social Security, Republicans shrank from him. Rep. Paul Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, has a plan for taking on the budget, but Republicans have been just as reluctant to sign on to his prescription. If secret negotiations aren't in the plan or already under way, we're all sunk. There isn't much time before the 2012 presidential race makes deal-making impossible. In the last three weeks, a senior ambassador of a U.S. ally, McConnell, and a senior White House official have all mentioned six to eight months as the time frame before presidential politics interfere with doing anything bold on domestic or foreign issues. With that kind of time pressure, someone must be working on a behind-the-scenes deal. If not, the predictable spat that played out today was an even bigger waste of time than usual. Also in Slate, Fred Kaplan lays out even more potential cuts to the Pentagon budget. Timothy Noah explains why the GOP favors such inconsequential discretionary cuts.

23	23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/02/was_obama_too_indecisive_on_egypt.html	"After it was announced that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was stepping down, at about 11 a.m. on Friday, the White House announced that President Obama would speak at 1:30 p.m. Then word came that the statement would be delayed and the time was TBD, which was fitting. Throughout the 18 days of protest in Egypt, U.S. policy constantly felt like it was to be determined. At first supportive of Mubarak, U.S. policy slowly moved to appear supportive of his ouster, stopping in the middle to appear to contradict itself. It looked sloppy. But diplomacy is always going to look sloppy when events are moving this quickly. The president can't move at Internet speed. By the time government officials had accurate information about what was actually happening in Cairo, the situation had changed. (The announcement was delayed Friday to make sure everyone had a clear picture.) On the other hand, there were some moments when the White House did itself no favors. CIA director Leon Panetta speculated Thursday that Mubarak would step down that night. He was wrong. There was no advantage in giving an opinion. The administration has also been criticized for not siding loudly enough with the protestors. America proclaims itself as a great promoter of freedom and democracy. Former Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel used to boast that the president's speech in Cairo two years ago calling for political transformation was the most important foreign policy speech in 20 years. Yet when the time came for forceful words to help protesters in the streets of Cairo, Obama seemed to lose his voice. Professor Jennifer Windsor of Georgetown University, who was formerly the executive director of Freedom House, argues that the administration failed long before this crisis, removing funding for groups that promote civil society in Egypt. Former administration adviser David Axelrod said the president had been quietly confronting Mubarak about reform for two years. Did he when the two talked on Jan. 18 after the change in government in Tunisia? Or did the president reassure Mubarak about the stability of U.S. support for his rule, as one administration official suggested? We won't know whether the president and his team missed a decisive moment until the history books are written and we learn what they were juggling. What we do know now is that top administration officials started each day together, and ended them with 1 a.m. conference calls. And they were dealing with a rapidly changing situation about which information was unreliable, involving a 30-year ally in the most dangerous region in the world. That increases the degree of difficulty a bit. The administration was also concerned that the United States not be seen as meddling in an organic movement. President George H.W. Bush faced a similar situation when the Berlin Wall fell. As he notes in his book, he was criticized for not speaking out. Democratic Congressional leaders said he was not doing enough to promote freedom and democracy. He resisted for days before finally saying, ""We will not exacerbate the problem by having the president of the United States posturing on the Berlin Wall."" If the United States had overplayed its hand, say administration officials, it would have allowed Mubarak and his allies to claim outside forces were meddling (he did claim that; it didn't work). It also would have suggested the United States had more power to shape events than it did. Most important, it would have detracted from the power and appeal of the protests: They were organic and peaceful and growing even without official commentary from the United States. In the end, this wasn't about America, and the more that is made clear, administration officials hope, the more it will help the movement for freedom in the Middle East. In addition, it will put responsibility for success in Egypt not on the United States, but on the Egyptians. Whether by design or dithering, U.S. policy makers didn't get in the way of events in Cairo. That strategy appears to have been successful. That may mean that in a world where developments can move so quickly, TBD is the new SOP. Become a fan of  Slate  and  John Dickerson  on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter."

24	24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/02/the_24hour_libertarian_revolt.html	"We were not supposed to be talking about the USA Patriot Act today. The 10-month extension of some of the act's provisions was supposed to be uncontroversial. Hours before Tuesday's vote, at his weekly briefing, Majority Leader Eric Cantor was asked, ""What changes will you try to make to the Patriot Act this year given that the extension will probably pass?"" Not long after that, Politico ran a pro-forma preview story: ""House to Pass PATRIOT Act Extension."" And then the House didn't pass the Patriot Act extension. It got close--seven more votes and there would have been the two-thirds majority necessary to suspend the rules and pass the extension, a common move used to protect popular bills from being ground down with amendments. One year earlier, in a Democratic House, a similar batch of extensions had sailed through on a 315-97 vote. Very quickly, a theory emerged to explain all this: It was, according to NBC News, ""Tea Party defiance."" The theory is a little flawed. The House of Representatives contains 87 Republican freshmen, many of them proud wavers of the Gadsden flag. Only eight freshmen voted against the rule. (A ninth newly elected Republican, Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick, voted no, but he's just returned to Congress after a four-year hiatus.) There were more Democrats--36--who switched their votes from last year to this year. So before the saga ends, with a majority vote tomorrow and a final vote on the bill Monday, let's review what we know. First: There might not be many hard-line libertarians in the new majority, but there are more of them than there have been at any time since 9/11. One ""no"" vote came from Rep. Bobby Schilling, R-Ill. The Democrat he beat in 2010 had infamously told a camera-wielding Tea Party activist that he didn't ""worry about the Constitution"" when it came to delivering health care. (The video of this quote is nudging toward 500,000 views.) Schilling wanted to let people know that this was not the way he thought about the Constitution. ""No one should be surprised by my vote,"" said Schilling. ""During my campaign I stated that we need increased national security but not without a thorough and complete look at the Patriot Act and its scope. I kept my promise to the people of the 17th District and voted 'no' against a bill that was rushed to the floor with limited debate. I will continue to support a strong national defense that does not infringe upon the rights of Americans."" Another ""no"" came from Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich. He's received less national attention than other Tea Party candidates. That's partly because he was a member of the state legislature before he became a member of Congress, slightly diminishing his government-outsider status. But he was one of the candidates endorsed by Ron Paul's Campaign for Liberty. He promised to do things like this if he made it to Congress. ""The business records provision allows the government to order the production of 'any tangible things'--e-mails, phone logs, and even library records,"" said Amash, who will probably vote against final passage. ""Worse still, the company turning over the records to the government is forbidden from telling the records' owner of the order.  Likewise, the act's roving wiretap provision goes far beyond a similar provision in criminal law.  It may allow the government continuously to monitor pay phones or public computers, even when a suspect is not using the devices.  The breadth of the provisions raises serious Fourth Amendment concerns in my mind, and I cannot support them as currently written."" There is a libertarian caucus on civil liberties issues inside the GOP. It is not large enough to stop bills on simple majority votes. But it's real. Since the middle of the aughts, there have been about a dozen Republican members of the House, and a couple of senators, willing to vote down Patriot Act extensions and other bills they view as civil liberties threats; in the Senate, they've just gained Rand Paul. There's another part of the Republican equation, though. There were 78 freshmen who voted ""aye."" They chose to extend, for 10 months, provisions of the Patriot Act that allow roving wiretaps, allow FISA courts to obtain any ""tangible thing"" needed in an investigation, and allow monitoring of noncitizens in the United States--the ""lone wolf"" provision. So it's pointless to muse about a possible left-libertarian alliance on civil liberties without a hard look at that 78-9 split. In a long, thoughtful musing about the vote, Salon's Glenn Greenwald conceded that the ""nature of [the conservative] movement means that last night's vote is far more of an isolated aberration than anything likely to change the bipartisan dynamic in a positive way."" Put another way: When most of the Tea Party class of 2010 got a chance to weaken the Patriot Act, it passed, and it cited the reasons that Bush-era Republicans always gave for these kinds of laws. ""These provisions maintain the flexibility that our intelligence community needs to monitor terror suspects and protect our country against international terrorism,"" said Rep. Michele Bachmann in a statement, released before the vote and before attending a ""Tea Party Town Hall"" afterward. ""As a mother of five and a foster mother to 23 children, I voted for these authorities so that our laws keep pace with the evolving threats posed by terrorists."" There's more proof, if you need it, that reports of the Tea Party's ""rebellion"" are exaggerated. On Wednesday, House Republicans fumbled another vote, needing and not getting a two-thirds majority for a bill to claw back $179 million in funding for the United Nations. But only two of the 238 Republicans on the floor voted against it. Around the same time, the House rules committee held an emergency hearing to breathe life back into the Patriot Act extension. Chairman David Dreier, R-Calif., noted with a mixture of mirth and bitterness that an emergency hearing like this was a ""bipartisan tradition."" The extension package that failed, he said, was ""identical"" to the one that passed a Democratic Congress. This was the message of leading Republicans all day--if the Democrats had stood pat, the bill would have passed. Dreier passed the microphone to Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, one of the long-serving Republicans who'd voted to reform the act, or delay reauthorization, every chance he got. Bishop would get a chance to change the bill in committee, and it would fail. ""You're going to make me pay for this, aren't you, sir?"" said Bishop. ""Yeah,"" said Dreier, mostly kidding. The bill was not changed. It was sent back for a majority vote--no amendments allowed--to occur on Thursday. Republicans may have to scale back their ambitions for supermajority votes, but they don't yet have to worry about the Tea Party stopping the clock for civil liberties. Like Slate on  Facebook.

The month started lousy for liberals, and it got lousier. On the 6th, White House ""green jobs czar"" Van Jones resigned, mortally wounded when a conservative blog found a 9/11 conspiracy petition with his name on it. Four days later, Andrew Breitbart's BigGovernment.com released a hidden camera video, filmed by young conservatives who pretended to be a prostitute and a pimp concerned for her welfare and who asked for tax advice from the community group ACORN. More ACORN tapes followed; on the 17th, the day that the last one went online, the House of Representatives--then controlled by Democrats-- voted to ban any government funds for ACORN. As the meltdown continued, there was some coming-to-Jesus at Media Matters for America, David Brock's moneyed watchdog group. The word went out: Progressives had just gotten their asses kicked. They needed to anticipate things like the Jones campaign or the ACORN tapes, and they needed to stop them from taking good people down with them. And that's how liberals responded to this month's ACORN tape sequel: the Live Action investigation of Planned Parenthood. (Critics of undercover conservative activists splutter when words like journalism and investigation are applied to what happens here, but let's use these terms for simplicity's sake.) At a few different locations, actors hired by Live Action pretended to be pimps, then waltzed into Planned Parenthood offices and asked for advice on birth control for girls younger than the age of consent. They got it. ""From the age of 12 up,"" said one Planned Parenthood volunteer in Roanoke, Va., ""for birth control, you can just come in and do that. You don't have to have a parent, OK?"" Another, in Falls Church, Va., appeared to assuage concerns about legality and photo IDs by promising that ""we don't necessarily look at the legal status."" The videos launched on Feb. 1, right after legislation to ban funding for birth control was introduced in the House and Senate. But the Live Action videos have not captivated the media or politicians like the ACORN tapes did. Within days of the ACORN tapes arriving online, several members of Congress had requested a federal investigation of the group, and 20 states were probing its affiliates. The tape's funky music and images of James O'Keefe with a funny hat and cane (not worn during the actual sting) became the stuff of liberal nightmares. The Live Action videos aren't so powerful. Planned Parenthood has fired one of the accidental stars of the videos, but only two state attorneys general have made noise about investigating Planned Parenthood, in New Jersey and Virginia. But coverage of the videos has focused more on the career of Live Action's Lila Rose--profiles never fail to mention that she's an aspiring actress--and less on what's in the videos. There are plenty of reasons for this. Media Matters and other liberal groups pounced as soon as the video went up. Media Matters welcomed the videos with a ""refresher course on Andrew Breitbart's dishonest tactics"" and the screaming headline ""HOAX VIDEO EXPOSED."" The hoax? Planned Parenthood had already warned the FBI about the sting. Subsequent Media Matters reports alleged that audio in the tapes had been spliced and mashed to make stuff up. Within 72 hours, the group put together a conference call for Planned Parenthood leaders to speak out about Rose and a joint letter to members of Congress from 26 progressive groups. Most of those groups didn't even work on abortion issues--the SEIU, the Sierra Club, the liberal think tank Demos. The goal was to stop another weak-kneed moment like the vote to defund ACORN. The message to Democrats: If you don't stop letting conservatives run these operations against us, they're never going to stop. Their cave-in on ACORN had led to people like Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., taking power and launching new investigations. ""Ever since ACORN, we've been very involved in sounding the alarm on this,"" said Nan Aron, the president of the Alliance for Justice, a progressive umbrella group that signed the letter to Congress. ""Attacks on Planned Parenthood don't arise in a vacuum. Darrell Issa and his ilk successfully took ACORN out of the game."" This is a game played at many levels at once. Conservatives want to think that the ACORN meltdown is repeatable--that's why you hear Newt Gingrich muse about the possibilities of ""defunding the left."" Liberals think they can prevent it from reoccurring. ACORN was too sloppy for too long and didn't develop a PR offensive or internal quality control after years of legal challenges to its voter-registration problems. That was ACORN's fault. It was the rest of the movement's fault that it didn't immediately challenge the credibility of the videos and that congressional Democrats were listless in how they responded to tapes running on repeat on cable news. ""They're unethical,"" said Ari Rabn-Havt, one of the key responders at Media Matters. ""I mean, we have nothing against doing hidden camera stuff, but if you have no compunction for the truth and you can release whatever you want, you can make stories better. And we, progressives, don't have a news network that will take this stuff right to air, frankly. That's part of the success here. Breitbart launched Big Government on Fox News. Glenn Beck previewed the ACORN tapes on his show."" And this is the most common way that progressives view their challenge. It's them against Breitbart and Fox. If they can inspire enough doubt about the conservative scoop to make news organizations pass on it, or hold it, they can stop an ACORN repeat. According to Breitbart, this was actually the progressive response to ACORN. Maybe progressives are working faster, but throwing up dust about a story that hurts them--well, that's how the left works, and how the media decides what to run. ""Lila Rose and Live Action are contending with the same forces in the media that don't want beyond-reproach left-leaning institutions to be exposed as corrupt and morally bankrupt,"" Breitbart said in an e-mail. ""Team Podesta, including Media Matters and Planned Parenthood itself, are coordinating and applying the same tactics they used in the ACORN scandal to grant the mainstream media excuses not to report on a video expose that would be front page news if it were against a politically incorrect group associated with the right. Can you imagine how media would react if pimp and prostitute undercover video implicated a mega-church, GOP congressmen or the NRA? Need it be argued that it would be everywhere?"" It depends what ""everywhere"" means. If they're doing it right, the conservative videographers and the progressive counterpunchers don't need the media to pay attention. The ACORN tapes got Congress rolling on a defunding bill before the non-News Corp. media really noticed the scandal. Media Matters helped write the book on Lila Rose before Republican politicians had even weighed in on her tapes. This is the battle now: Who can weaponize the tools of journalism, and who can take out the warheads? Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter."

26	26	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/02/the_donothing_congress.html	"There are small, loud signs on the desks outside of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's offices. The ""Cantor rule"" is written on all of them. It reads: ""Are my efforts addressing job creation and the economy? Are they reducing spending? Are they shrinking the size of the federal government while protecting and expanding liberty? If not, why am I doing it. ... Why are WE doing it?"" Cantor is not the first Republican to describe his job like this. After November's election, Newt Gingrich sent Republicans wall charts with the legend ""What have I done today to help create jobs and paychecks?"" Sixteen years ago, Gingrich was in almost the same position Cantor is in now. (He was actually speaker, not the No. 2 Republican.) His party had taken over the House of Representatives. It could make policy. It could, actually, pass any damn bill it wanted. There is an important difference: Cantor's Congress isn't passing as much as Gingrich's. It's not passing as much as the Democratic House of 2007, the one led by Nancy Pelosi. When Gingrich and Pelosi came into power, they came bearing thick legislative agendas, like Moses descending Sinai. Gingrich's Republicans promised votes on 10 items within 100 days--and got them. Pelosi's Democrats promised votes on six bills in the first 100 hours of power--and got them done in 87. The new Republicans promised much less. In December, Cantor announced that every two weeks of House business would be followed by a weeklong recess. ""We had freshmen who said we should be here less, a lot less than we have been for the past two years,"" said Rep. Pat Tiberi, R-Ohio, who helped put together the schedule. In his first speech on becoming speaker, John Boehner promised that the next Congress would move slowly. ""We will dispense with the conventional wisdom that bigger bills are always better,"" he said, ""that fast legislating is good legislating."" This set up the argument that Republicans used over a slow first month: Inaction was preventing worse things from happening. (There was no action in Congress for one week because of the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, but this only delayed the two-on-one-off schedule.) Repeal bills were good for the economy. On Wednesday, they applauded as the Repeal of the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act got a vote in the Senate. ""Senate Republicans have kept their promise,"" said Boehner. But the repeal failed, as everyone expected it would. When he announced the spending limits in his first budget as chairman of the Budget Committee, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., said Republicans had ""voted to cut trillions of dollars in new government spending by advancing a repeal of the President's health care law."" They had, but they also knew that repeal wouldn't go further, so why did that count? The answer: They are taking an approach to legislating completely antithetical to what President Obama proposed in his State of the Union speech. They don't want Congress to ""do big things."" Government, in general, should not do big things. This is the new normal, and it's not how this stuff usually works. In power, Gingrich was captivated by a concept that he still talks about--pushing legislation that 60 percent or 70 percent of voters could support. This was the impetus for the $500-per-child tax credit, a bill that required the CBO to calculate the cost of federal mandates, welfare reform, and--to name two items that died in the Senate--term limits and a balanced budget amendment. In 2007, Democrats wanted to kick off with supermajority support for popular bills, such as an increase in the minimum wage and implementation of the 9/11 Commission's final recommendations. This year, Republicans have kicked things off with repeal bills. There are no bold new ideas. There is just dismantling of Democratic ideas. And the result of this, so far, has been resilient Republican popularity. At the end of January, a Gallup poll gave Republicans their first favorable approval ratings since 2005, when their Bush-era slide began. Since the election, Rasmussen Reports polls have put the number of Americans identifying as Republicans close to the number of Americans who identify as Democrats. I asked Scott Rasmussen why this was. ""The Republicans are helped by low expectations,"" said Rasmussen. ""Hardly anybody expects them to actually cut spending. The GOP is also helped by the fact that Democrats still control the White House and the Senate. You cite the lack of legislative accomplishment. Remember, by a 3-to-1 margin, voters believe that no matter how bad something is, Congress can always make it worse. That's true regardless of whether Democrats or Republicans are in charge. Lack of action may be a plus in some eyes."" If that's what voters are after, they're going to have a fun couple of years. The first bipartisan bill that might actually reach the president's desk didn't come until Wednesday, when the Senate approved an amendment to kill a new requirement for businesses to fill out health care tax forms. Most of the rest of the legislative action in Congress is happening in two areas. One: budget cuts that Democrats, fitting comfortably into an old role, will decry as monstrous. Two: repeal bills, bills that would tie up federal regulators, and other items that can't survive the Senate or a presidential veto. The forecast through 2013 is creative destruction.

The Senate held a vote on the full repeal of the Job-Killing Health Care Law! They said it couldn't be done, and by ""they,"" we mean Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev. ""If Harry Reid is so confident that the repeal vote should die in the Senate,"" said House Majority leader Eric Cantor last month, ""then he should bring it up for a vote, if he's so confident he's got the votes."" Reid's hand was forced; Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., got a vote last night on an amendment that would have repealed all of health care reform. The amendment failed, with no Democrat voting for repeal. It was a long road from March 2010, when repeal was a glimmer in one of Michele Bachmann's off-camera-looking eyes, to a vote like this. But the vote made it even clearer that repeal won't happen, and that Democrats won't bend on it, until at the very earliest 2013. There was a minor, bipartisan victory on health care anyway, when most of the Senate rolled back a hated provision requiring business owners to fill out more forms.

28	28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/02/happy_talk.html	"President Obama has been more upbeat in 2011 than he said he was going to be. Last year he promised America a tough conversation about cutting the deficit. ""If we are concerned about debt and deficits, then we're going to have to take actions that are difficult and we're going to have to tell the truth to the American people,"" he said. Shrinking government would be his focus for the remainder of his first term, he pledged. Everything else would be secondary, even investments of the kind he is now proposing. They would have to wait until he presented""a credible plan for dealing with the medium- and long-term budget problems."" Now, instead of tough talk, the president is offering stirring slogans. ""Win the future"" was the theme of his State of the Union address. ""We do Big Things"" is now on T-shirts available to Obama donors. ""Startup America"" was unveiled Monday to encourage entrepreneurs. If the first lady hadn't taken ""Let's Move"" for her anti-obesity campaign, it could have been used for the president's push for high-speed rail. The president has decided that he'll let Republicans be the dour ones. A credible deficit-reduction plan is no longer a precondition for weeks of talk about plans for government investment. Let Rep. Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, do all that gloomy talking about the grim fiscal picture. As one GOP aide put it after the president's State of the Union speech and Ryan's official response: ""He's the optimistic one, and we're the ones that want to lock up your children."" The two parties are making opposite bets about what the public really thinks about the deficit. The president is betting that people don't see an iron connection between reducing the deficit and increasing the number of jobs. When they judge who is doing more for them--the GOP or the president--they will pick the person optimistic about the future, not the guys preaching pain. Republicans get this, so they're working hard to reiterate that their deficit agenda is a jobs agenda: Jobs will be lost if the deficit isn't reduced drastically. They've produced 222 economists who make this case. They'll have to do better than that, because the White House can bus in their own fleet of economists. Short and sharp is what is needed to rebut Captain Win the Future. So far, the message needs some work: ""By running up the--spending money we don't have, running up the huge budget deficits, we create more uncertainty in the private sector,"" says House Speaker John Boehner, who then becomes almost tautological. ""This is where cutting spending will create jobs because it is going to bring greater fiscal responsibility in Washington, D.C., end some of the uncertainty, and allow jobs to be created in America."" The problem is that big deficits don't have an immediate job impact. Right now interest rates are low. The danger is that when the level of debt becomes unsustainable, rates will spike quickly. The policy response will be drastic cuts or tax increases or both. The mix will be catastrophic. In anticipation of this, business is skittish. The GOP needs to explain this deficit-and-jobs link at Twitter length: Deficits make businesses worry that interest rates will go up. To hedge, they hold off hiring and investing. Republicans will point out that the president's pitch is wrongheaded on policy grounds.When he makes his pitch for investment, he argues he's taking the long view. But others taking the long view say the deficit should be the first priority. The deficit, they point out, is the government's biggest problem. Moreover, the president's push for ""investment"" consists of little more than nudges and incentives. He has real power over the federal budget and thus the federal deficit. When the economy is bad, the issue of the deficit can be a proxy. People express their frustration with the lack of job growth by blaming Washington profligacy. It's also a simple issue lawmakers can talk about. Get the deficit number down, and jobs will return. This is easy to say when you're out of power and don't have to get specific about how you're going to do any of this. The primacy of the deficit is the message the GOP took from the 2010 election. In exit polls, 37 percent said Congress' No. 1 priority should be reducing the budget deficit. The GOP also knows, however, that the politics of the deficit change when the debate gets specific. That's why Republican leaders didn't get specific before the election and are slow to do so now. People don't want to make the hard choices. They're already sacrificing enough. Complicating this political moment is that the debate between the two parties isn't really about how to address the deficit. Both the president and Republicans have plans to tackle the problem. It's a matter of emphasis. The president isn't ignoring the deficit. He's just not making the grueling case he promised. Not even close. (He's even punted on the recommendations of his Fiscal Commission, the formation of which was itself a punt from hard choices). He's hoping that people won't judge his efforts on the economy based on what he does about the deficit. There's some support for his position: In those same exit polls, 37 percent also said that Congress' No. 1 priority should be ""spending to create jobs."" In a recent Pew poll, 84 percent said politicians should make jobs a top priority. Only 64 percent said the budget deficit should be a top priority. Furthermore, deficit reduction is not an area where the president can play to his political strength. He'll never out-cut Republicans, who are engaged in an intramural game of how-low-can-you-go. Plus, say White House aides, when the president submits his budget, it will be full of painful choices. Months will be spent arguing not about whether there will be pain, but how much of it there will be. Obama knows this is coming, so his message now is kind of a base coat of optimism that can help people understand why they should go through all of this hard choosing. This isn't just about political positioning, of course. The president genuinely believes that his ""Win the Future"" policies will lead to more jobs. In November 2012, it will be all that matters. If the unemployment rate is still high, the president isn't going to win re-election by saying he was painfully honest about the necessity for huge budget cuts. Plus, with interest rates so low, why not invest a little now in the hopes that economic growth helps plug the deficit. Even if the investment agenda doesn't affect the economy immediately, his constant talk about innovation and improving education will show him concerned about the key issue voters care about, allowing them to make a connection between his actions and economic improvement. This drama will play out over the next few months in a three-act play about how to shrink the government. First will come the March vote to continue funding the government. Next will be a debate over passing the federal budget. Finally, there will be a vote to raise the debt ceiling. What's going on now is an extended prologue."

29	29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2011/01/into_the_void.html	"Conservatives pleased about Judge Roger Vinson's 78-page decision rendering ""void"" the entire Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 can send their letters of thanks to a group that doesn't get many of them--and is sure to get few from its liberal supporters outraged by the decision. I refer, of course, to Senate Democrats. One year ago, in the aftermath of Republican Scott Brown's upset win in the Massachusetts Senate race, Democrats faced a dilemma. They lacked the votes to pass a massive health care overhaul, which had already been passed by the House and Senate but would need to be approved again by both if it were changed in conference committee. They had two options. They could scrap the bill entirely and try to get through a few popular reforms. (This was the approach favored by then-White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel.) Or the House could ram through the Senate's version of the bill, with no public option and a host of the other problems that crop up in months of messy infighting and committee work. Democrats chose the second option. The bill became law. Republican attorneys general in Virginia, Florida, and eventually 25 other states joined lawsuits to overturn the law. They argued that the legislation's individual mandate, which would start in 2014 and fine people who did not obtain health insurance, was unconstitutional. And today, Judge Roger Vinson of Florida's Northern District ruled that they were right. Oh, and one more thing: ""Because the individual mandate is unconstitutional and not severable,"" writes Vinson, ""the entire Act must be declared void."" The bill passed by the House and Senate did not include a severability clause. Most big pieces of legislation include such a clause, which typically explains that ""invalidity or unenforceability of one or more provisions of this Agreement shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement."" So how did the Democrats fumble this? Shortly after Monday's decision, a few liberal attorneys got on the phone for a call with reporters, sponsored by the Center for American Progress and the American Constitution Society. I asked Neera Tanden, who's now the chief operating officer at CAP but who was a senior adviser at the Department of Health and Human Services during the passage of the bill, why there was no severability clause. ""One of the reasons there was not was that there was a keen understanding in the process that courts generally have a deferential view of severability and try to make the rulings have the least impact,"" she said. ""And that took the pressure off the severability clause."" That was the thinking at the time from plenty of experts.  Two months ago, Washington and Lee University law professor Timothy Jost told Brian Beutler--one of the first reporters to notice the severability slip-up--that it was unlikely that a lower court would void the entire health care bill if it voided the mandate, because ""the normal rule is that partial invalidation is the required course.""* Today, his optimism left tattered on Judge Vinson's carpet, Jost intimated that the Senate had made a mess of things. ""This was the Senate bill that was passed in December,"" said Jost. ""Everyone expected that there would be a conference committee that would straighten out the issues in the bill. And then there was Scott Brown's election."" In his decision, Vinson argues that Congress' failure to include a severability clause was a clear indication that every piece of the law needed to survive for any piece of it to work. He cites the 2006 decision in  Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of New England, arguing that it is not up to the courts to try and salvage the good parts of a law that has been partially struck down. ""Severing the individual mandate from the Act along with the other insurance reform provisions--and in the process reconfiguring an exceedingly lengthy and comprehensive legislative scheme--cannot be done consistent with the principles set out above,"" writes Vinson. ""Going through the 2,700-page Act line-by-line, invalidating dozens (or hundreds) of some sections while retaining dozens (or hundreds) of others, would not only take considerable time and extensive briefing, but it would, in the end, be tantamount to rewriting a statute in an attempt to salvage it. ... Courts should not even attempt to do that. It would be impossible to ascertain on a section-by-section basis if a particular statutory provision could stand (and was intended by Congress to stand) independently of the individual mandate. The interoperative effects of a partial deletion of legislative provisions are often unforeseen and unpredictable. For me to try and 'second guess' what Congress would want to keep is almost impossible."" That rationale makes no sense to Jost. ""It's much more likely that the severability clause wasn't intentionally left out,"" he said today. In plainer terms: It's much more likely that the Democrats messed up. Where do they go next? The Justice Department will ask for a stay of Vinson's decision, which is what it needs for the rest of the health care law to be enforced and implemented. The soonest that this case could be kicked up to the Supreme Court would be 2012. So the administration and other supporters of the law have at least one more year to convince themselves that the problems with the legislation won't lead to it being shredded when it hits the high court. (They have won two of the four ""ObamaCare"" cases, not that this matters when they lose a big one.) Their administration's lawyers are hoping that the next judges who take this case are more concerned with Supreme Court precedent than with, say, the Federalist Papers. ""In a frequently cited law review article,"" writes Vinson, ""one Constitutional scholar has painstakingly tallied each appearance of the word 'commerce' in Madison's notes on the Constitutional Convention and in The Federalist, and discovered that in none of the ninety-seven appearances of that term is it ever used to refer unambiguously to activity beyond trade or exchange."" The scholar being quoted here is Georgetown's Randy Barnett, the intellectual force behind the Repeal Amendment. But Vinson goes further than that. He points out, semi-relevantly, that the mandate isn't good politics. ""I note that in 2008,"" Vinson writes in a footnote, ""then-Senator Obama supported a health care reform proposal that did not include an individual mandate because he was at that time strongly opposed to the idea, stating that 'if a mandate was the solution, we can try that to solve homelessness by mandating everybody to buy a house.' "" At another point, he says that the Founders who rebelled against a tea tax would not ""have set out to create a government with the power to force people to buy tea in the first place."" Liberals can only hope that the next judge who gets to decide whether the health care law is constitutional is more kind than that. The fate of health care reform is where it was yesterday--in the hands of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. Like Slate on  Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter.
