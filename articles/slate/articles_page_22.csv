At some point in a presidential election--usually on the eve of voting--someone will run a story on the former New York mayor's presidential ambitions. National reporters, who are either based in New York or Washington, will debate it, and we'll eventually conclude that the exercise is a bit silly. Bloomberg won't run--it was just a trial balloon, after all--and we'll move on. On Saturday, the New York Times reported on Bloomberg's newest presidential speculation:	Why Michael Bloomberg Could Make Donald Trump President
1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/nate_silver_said_donald_trump_had_no_shot_where_did_he_go_wrong.html	"For the past six months, one big question has loomed over the 2016 election: Is the candidacy of Donald J. Trump an amusing bit of reality TV or a terrifying and dangerous challenge to the country's political system? At first, Trump's popularity was easy to dismiss. It was nothing more than a phase, the result of Trump's celebrity status and his talent for provocation. His antics made it hard to look away, but it was easy to convince yourself that Trump mania would never lead to anything serious, like the Republican nomination. It was especially easy to come to that conclusion if you were reading FiveThirtyEight, the statistics-driven news website founded by Nate Silver. Since the beginning of Trump's campaign last June, the election guru and his colleagues have been consistently bearish on Trump's chances. Silver, who made his name by using cold hard math to call 49 out of 50 states in the 2008 general election and all 50 in 2012, has served as a reassuring voice in the midst of Trump's shocking rise. For those of us who didn't want to believe we lived in a country where Donald Trump could be president, Silver's steady, level-headed certainty felt just as soothing as his unwavering confidence in Barack Obama's triumph over Mitt Romney four years ago. What exactly has Silver been saying? In September, he told CNN's Anderson Cooper that Trump had a roughly 5-percent chance of beating his GOP rivals. In November, he explained that Trump's national following was about as negligible as the share of Americans who believe the Apollo moon landing was faked. On Twitter, he compared Trump to the band Nickelback, which he described as being ""[d]isliked by most, super popular with a few."" In a post titled ""Why Donald Trump Isn't A Real Candidate, In One Chart,"" Silver's colleague Harry Enten wrote that Trump had a better chance of ""playing in the NBA Finals"" than winning the Republican nomination. Multiple times over the past six months, Silver has reminded his readers that four years ago, daffy fly-by-nighters like Herman Cain and Michele Bachmann led the GOP field at various points. Trump's poll numbers, he wrote, would drop just like theirs had. In one August post, ""Donald Trump's Six Stages of Doom,"" Silver actually laid out a schedule for the candidate's inevitable collapse. That collapse is running late. Here we are, a few days from the Iowa caucus, and Trump's poll numbers haven't gone down at all. The latest data suggest that he leads his closest rival, Ted Cruz, by about 5 points in Iowa and almost 20 points in New Hampshire. He has also recently become the top GOP contender according to the betting market Betfair. Meanwhile, members of the so-called GOP establishment, who previously expressed open contempt for Trump, now seem to be warming to him. On Jan. 16, the Washington Post quoted the former finance chairman for Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign saying there was a ""growing feeling"" among many in the GOP that Trump ""may be the guy."" Bob Dole praised Trump in the New York Times as a dealmaker who has the ""right personality"" to do business with Congress. Orrin Hatch, the most senior Republican in the Senate, told CNN he was ""coming around"" on Trump. It's clear, now, that Silver and his fellow analysts at FiveThirtyEight underestimated Trump. Silver himself recently admitted as much, writing in a blog post published last week that he'd been too skeptical about Trump's chances. ""Things are lining up better for Trump than I would have imagined,"" he wrote, adding that ""[i]f, like me, you expected"" the show to have been over by now, ""you have to revisit your assumptions."" Everyone makes mistakes--even Nate Silver. It's also entirely possible that the Trump collapse is still to come and that as soon as we see the actual voting process play out, the hollowness of his popularity will reveal itself. Still, Silver is right that his assumptions are worth revisiting. Maybe the Trump phenomenon is so unprecedented that no statistical model could have foreseen it. Or maybe it took a candidate as unique as Donald Trump to reveal the flaws and limitations of Silver's prediction machine. * * * To understand how Silver got Trump wrong, it helps to understand what exactly he was skeptical about, and why. A look at his campaign coverage reveals that two basic beliefs guided Silver's thinking. The first centered on the polls showing Trump miles ahead of his rivals. These polls have been plentiful, and they have been consistent. To pick two more or less at random, CNN showed Trump's support in Iowa grow from 22 percent in August to 37 percent this past week. According to national polls conducted by CBS and the New York Times, he has gone from polling at 24 percent nationally in August to 36 percent earlier this month. None of this has impressed Silver. No matter what the polls said, as he wrote on FiveThirtyEight week after week, it was important to remember they were fundamentally unreliable and not at all indicative of how primary voters would ultimately cast their ballots. This has always been true of pre-primary polls, Silver argued, in part because primary voters have historically waited until the last minute to decide whom to support and in part because the people answering questions from pollsters are not necessarily the ones who will end up actually voting. Anything Silver says about polling carries weight. Polls are his bread and butter--the raw materials he filters through his proprietary model to predict the outcomes of elections. His expertise on which polls to ignore, which ones to trust, and how much to trust them is central to his political wisdom. The early national polls showing Trump in the lead, Silver wrote, were basically worthless. As he put it in a post titled ""Donald Trump Is Winning The Polls--and Losing the Nomination,"" they not only ""lack empirical power to predict the nomination"" but ""describe a fiction."" Silver thought that it was foolish of reporters and columnists to act like Trump's numbers were significant. The fact that pundits insisted on investing them with so much importance proved they were motivated more by the demands of the news cycle than by a commitment to truth--a tendency Silver has always taken pride in avoiding. The problem, Silver believed, wasn't just that the media legitimized polls that didn't deserve people's attention. It was worse than that: By talking about Trump's poll numbers like they mattered, the media risked distorting future polls, thereby reinforcing the false narrative of Trump's dominance. ""Some voters may be coughing up Trump's name in polls because he's the only candidate they've been hearing about,"" Silver wrote in December, noting that the media has given Trump's campaign ""more coverage than literally all the other Republicans combined."" Silver's error, in retrospect, was to conflate his doubts about the polls with his doubts about Trump's viability as a candidate. In other words, it's perfectly possible for Silver to have been correct in saying the early polls did not constitute proof of a massive Trump lead, while also being wrong about the likelihood that Trump would become the nominee. This mistake is illustrated most clearly in that post headlined ""Donald Trump's Six Stages of Doom,"" in which Silver asserted that ""Trump's campaign will fail by one means or another"" before ticking off a bunch of reasons to be suspicious of the early polls that showed him in the lead. While the post made brief mention of Trump's ""poor organization in caucus states, poor understanding of delegate rules,"" and his lack of ""support from superdelegates,"" it didn't offer much on why Silver found it so unlikely that lots and lots of people would vote for him. This brings us to the second basic belief guiding Silver's skepticism about Trump mania. Polls aside, the history of modern American politics made it clear to him that a ""Trump-like candidate"" could never win the nomination. What is a ""Trump-like candidate""? Under Silver's definition, it's someone who has low favorability ratings and, more important, is hated by party leaders. Citing a theory laid out in The Party Decides--an influential work of political science which says that primary candidates don't win without the support of the party establishment--Silver has argued that Trump was an almost certain loser. Even if Trump managed to survive until the Republican National Convention, Silver wrote, ""the Republican Party would go to extraordinary lengths to avoid nominating him."" The race has not played out that way. Indications in December that GOP leaders were either powerless against Trump or unwilling to go after him struck Silver as ""perplexing""--precisely the emotion you would expect from a quantitatively inclined thinker confronted with a reality that hasn't conformed to his calculations. In a chat with colleagues published on FiveThirtyEight, Silver discussed possible reasons why GOP leaders had not been more aggressive in snuffing out Trump earlier, when he might have been an easier target. ""From the get-go, they haven't seemed to have any plan at all for how to deal with Trump,"" he wrote. What's crucial to note here is that Silver's confidence about how the GOP would respond to Trump was never really based on any statistical calculations. Rather, in repeatedly citing The Party Decides, he was relying on a theory about how political parties work--one that's been embraced by some of the very same pundits that Silver has defined himself against. And while it's true that The Party Decides was an empirical work based on historical data, the notion that GOP leaders would find a way to kill Trump's campaign is, on some level, premised on a belief that the individual actors who control the Republican Party would all act as rationally as Nate Silver would if he were in their shoes. When news reports came out this month that influential Republican donors were starting to think Trump wouldn't be such a bad candidate, Silver wrote, with some exasperation, ""the donor class is probably wrong."" Maybe what happened here is that Silver was the one sober guy in a room full of drunks, powerless to stop irrational party leaders from taking unreliable polling data seriously. Even if you believe that establishment figures are only giving Trump a look because they despise his closest rival, Ted Cruz, it's undeniable that their thinking is being informed by Trump's numbers. The fact that Silver thinks those numbers are silly doesn't matter. They were consequential, and now that the Iowa caucus is one week away, those consequences are becoming more and more serious. Why was Silver so confident that the ""party decides"" theory would hold? One reason, surely, is that it always had in the past--if you want a recent example, think back to the mavericks of the 2012 GOP contest, who were squashed like bugs until party favorite Romney was the last man standing. But it also seems possible that Silver believed the GOP would stop Trump for a simpler reason: It was what he wanted to happen. Silver did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story, so the best I can do is venture a guess. Maybe, like many people who have watched Trump's rise with increasing horror, Silver latched onto a narrative that justified rejecting the Apprentice star's achievements, identifying them as symptoms of a media bubble rather than a reflection of real popular sentiment. If that's the case, Silver turns out to have a good bit in common with the pundits that he and his unemotional, numbers-driven worldview were supposed to render obsolete. Faced with uncertainty, Silver chose to go all in on an outcome that felt right, one that meshed with his preexisting beliefs about how the world is supposed to work. * * * There is another, more narrow explanation for why Trump eluded Silver. As effective as the FiveThirtyEight approach was when applied to Obama vs. McCain and Obama vs. Romney, perhaps it just doesn't work nearly as well when applied to primaries. If Silver's system depends largely on interpreting poll numbers, how reliable can that system be if the pre-Iowa and New Hampshire polls are basically worthless? Garbage in, garbage out. ""I think figuring out what's going on in a primary is more of an art than a science,"" says Steve Kornacki, a political analyst at MSNBC who has been covering presidential campaigns since 2002. ""There's just so much more volatility, coming from so many different levels in a primary. And there's a lot more art involved in figuring out what's going on than there is in a general election, especially in an era when 80 percent of the country knows whether they're team blue or team red and which way they vote."" Of course, Silver knows this, and he has taken certain steps to compensate for it. In a 2,800-word blog post laying out FiveThirtyEight's methodology for forecasting primaries, he explained how he and his team use state and national polls alongside party leader endorsements. He also left room for the possibility that FiveThirtyEight's prediction ""might be totally wrong."" ""Forecasting primaries and caucuses is challenging, much more so than general elections,"" Silver wrote, adding that ""an unusual candidate like Donald Trump tends to have especially uncertain forecasts."" Where does all that uncertainty leave FiveThirtyEight? In the months leading up to Iowa and New Hampshire, frequent Silver critic Matt Bruenig told me the FiveThirtyEight founder is ""in a situation where the only thing he's really capable of doing--the thing that he's exceptional at--is not really available to him, so he ends up doing what normal reporters do."" Bruenig added: ""It just makes him like everyone else. ... Anyone can read The Party Decides and be like, 'Oh yeah, this is what social science says will happen.' "" (It may not be entirely true that this GOP primary was a hopeless exercise for data journalists. Though early polls may not be the most solid data points, it's possible that FiveThirtyEight could have done a better job interpreting them: As Kornacki points out, Silver's insistence on comparing Trump to Joe Lieberman and Rudy Giuliani--candidates with high name recognition who led in primary polls before imploding--failed to consider that both Lieberman and Giuliani led their respective races very early, while Trump has built his lead more gradually. RealClearPolitics, which averages multiple polls, shows Trump starting at just 6 percent last July.) In Silver's defense, he has occasionally given voice to self-doubt. He concluded a Jan. 6 chat with FiveThirtyEight staff by saying, ""Yeah, the pundits are probably full of shit, but there's a chance we're full of shit too, so let's wait and see what happens."" For the most part, though, Silver his proclaimed his skepticism about Trump loudly, repeatedly, and unequivocally. His predictions of Trump's collapse--at an event at the 92nd Street Y in September he literally told the audience to ""calm down"" about his supposed march to the nomination--have not betrayed much caution or uncertainty. As irrational as it seems for a quantitative analyst to comment so confidently on something he knows he can't reliably predict, it's also not all that surprising. Silver has a website to run, after all, and that means covering Trump--and making predictions about him--whether the necessary data is available or not. The theory that Donald Trump was a real threat to the status quo was a perfect target for Silver and his colleagues. Throughout 2015 and into 2016, they set out to prove that this media sensation was being amplified by a credulous, mathematically illiterate press corps. A Trump implosion would be a classic Silver victory, one that would demonstrate the superiority of rational, data-driven analysis over the chatter of insiders and vague notions of ""momentum."" Instead, the rise of Trump might have demonstrated the limits of Silver's powers. As Dave Weigel wrote in the Washington Post recently, Trump's enormous popularity--a tidal wave of support that Silver has said will soon abate--has been the story of the campaign. In his piece, Weigel argued that it wasn't the first time a primary bid turned out to signal a major shift in the political winds, from the campaign of George Wallace in 1964, which Weigel said represented ""a historic moment in the politics of backlash,"" to that of Pat Robertson in 1988, which ""cemented the influence of the religious right in Republican electoral politics."" While none of those candidates won their party's nomination, it would have been irresponsible for the media to ignore the significance of their campaigns, as Silver has encouraged his audience, and the press, to do with Trump. While it's true that ""the rise of Trump"" may not end with Trump becoming the nominee, it has revealed, or perhaps even caused, a profound shift in the nation's political climate. As Kornacki put it to me, ""It took Donald Trump saying all this stuff""--floating the idea of denying Muslims entry into the United States, for instance--""to reveal there was a massive constituency for it."" Missing the significance of Trumpism is a different kind of failure than, say, calling the 2012 election for Mitt Romney. It also might be a more damning one. Botching your general election forecast by a couple of percentage points suggests a flawed mathematical formula. Actively denying the reality of Trump's success suggests Silver may never have been capable of explaining the world in a way so many believed he could in 2008 and 2012, when he was telling them how likely it was that Obama would become, and remain, the president. ""This is an extraordinary, unusual, utterly bizarre election year, in which events that have never happened before are happening,"" says Blake Zeff, the editor of the political news site Cafe and a former campaign aide to Obama and Hillary Clinton. ""That's a nightmare scenario for a projection model that is predicated on historical trends."" While Zeff cautioned it was premature to pillory Silver for missing out on Trumpism, the point stands: What was true yesterday is not necessarily true today, and that's a problem for Silver and his team of prognosticators. In 2008, Silver emerged as a new kind of journalist. His data-driven approach to political analysis was a necessary corrective to a media herd that too often relied on gut feelings and received wisdom. So long as punditry continues to exist, thinkers like Silver will remain essential. But the rise of FiveThirtyEight hasn't changed the fundamental purpose of journalism: to pay attention as the world changes and to try to understand what's driving that change. You could argue Silver never promised he was capable of doing those things--that all he ever intended to do was predict the future, not explain it. But Trump's campaign, which is forcing Americans to ask themselves how such a hateful, boorish candidate could capture the imagination of so many of their fellow citizens, makes it clear that truly revelatory analysis must tell us ""why,"" not just ""what."" If only Nate Silver could give us both."	Nate Silver Said Donald Trump Had No Shot. Where Did He Go Wrong?

Cruz admits that Assad, who has used chemical weapons on his own people, is a bad man. But Assad has come up with a clever strategy. With the aid of Russia's air force, Assad is wiping out the more moderate elements of the Syrian opposition. Assad's goal is to leave the world with only two choices: Leave him in power, or allow the only remaining alternative, ISIS, to take over Syria. Given the choice, Cruz prefers Assad. In an interview last month, Cruz concluded: ""If President Obama, aided by a lot of Washington establishment Republicans, succeeds in toppling Assad, the result will be that Syria will be taken over by ISIS and the radical Islamic terrorists. That's worse."" But Cruz hasn't just bought Assad's logic. He's copying it. In the Republican primaries, Cruz's goal is to eliminate every palatable alternative candidate, leaving the GOP with only two choices: himself or Donald Trump. Cruz has adopted this strategy for two reasons. First, his colleagues despise him. No senator has endorsed him. In an interview published Wednesday, Bob Dole, the former Republican Senate majority leader, spoke for many leaders in the party: ""Nobody likes him."" Second, Cruz knows that Republican strategists are afraid of how he, as the presidential nominee, would affect the party politically. Two weeks ago, Karl Rove warned that Cruz, unlike almost any other candidate, would make the 2016 election ""dicey"" for Republicans if he were nominated. Other Republican pundits and operatives agree. Polls justify these concerns. In six weeks of Gallup data, from December to mid-January, Cruz scored worse than most of his Republican rivals in net favorability among self-identified independents and Democrats. Among independents, Sen. Marco Rubio's net rating was positive. Cruz's was negative. Among Democrats, Cruz's net rating was nine points worse than Rubio's. When Gallup narrowed its analysis to respondents who were familiar with the candidates, the gap between Rubio and Cruz increased. But the data also showed something else: As bad as Cruz's numbers were, Donald Trump's were worse. Trump's net negative rating was 27 percentage points among independents and 70 points among Democrats. In head-to-head matchups against Hillary Clinton, Rubio scored almost two percentage points better than Cruz. But Cruz scored almost almost four points better than Trump. Many Republican leaders are terrified of Trump. Rove predicted that if Trump were to win the nomination, ""the GOP will lose the White House and the Senate, and its majority in the House will fall dramatically."" There's evidence to support this concern. A poll taken for the National Republican Congressional Committee reportedly found that if the GOP were to nominate Trump, a 48 percent plurality of respondents would be less likely to vote for a Republican congressional candidate. In Arizona, a survey found that with Trump atop the ballot, 30 percent of ""high efficacy"" Republicans would be less motivated to vote, and 20 percent would be less inclined to vote for down-ballot Republican candidates. That's why Cruz has adopted the Assad strategy. For months, while Assad avoided conflict with ISIS, Cruz avoided conflict with Trump. Instead, Cruz targeted Rubio for sponsoring an ""amnesty"" bill. (Cruz also lied about his own role in the immigration debate.) Meanwhile, Rubio, Gov. John Kasich, Gov. Chris Christie, and Jeb Bush savaged one another. Not until Jan. 14, when the candidates met for their sixth debate, did Cruz turn his guns on Trump. In an interview with moderator Neil Cavuto after the debate, Cruz asserted:"	Ted Cruz's Assad Strategy

Bernie Sanders explained about midway through a rally in Peterborough on Thursday, ""a lot of stuff gets thrown around. That's what politics is about; media picks up on this stuff."" We do. ""And one of the arguments being used against me is that: 'Bernie Sanders--nice guy--but you know what? He just cannot win a general election. He's up against the Republicans, my goodness, there's no way he's going to beat Donald Trump and these other candidates.' "" Who is this voice of concern to whom he refers? For starters: Hillary Clinton and all of her proxies, meaning most elected Democrats in the United States. Here they all are in the New York Times carping about how a Sanders-topped Democratic ticket will quite possibly mark the end of elected Democrats in the United States. The Clinton campaign recently has been releasing ads focused on her electability in November, arguing that she's the only Democrat who can ""stop them,"" the treacherous Republicans. It is the Clinton mothership attack to which all subattacks are tied. Her campaign criticized Sanders on Thursday for his comment in the most recent Democratic debate about how we should ""move as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with Iran."" (Read my colleague Josh Keating for a more developed consideration of Sanders' remark.) Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon suggested that Republicans would slice Sanders apart over a remark like this. ""I can safely predict,"" Fallon said, ""that Republicans would love to have a debate with someone who thinks we should move quickly to warmer relations with a major sponsor of terrorism like Iran."" But the concerns are not just claptrap coming from a desperate rival campaign. Sanders would be the most left-wing nominee the Democratic Party has nominated in a long time. Republican Party operatives, who are having difficulty ushering their own most electable candidates through the primary process, aren't laying a finger on Sanders because they pray that he wins the nomination. They're gamely helping him advance his arguments against Clinton to this end. Electability is not just another dumb invention of airhead political consultants and pundits, either. Undecided Democratic voters, many of whom might lean toward Bernie on his message alone, want to hear Sanders' electability case from the man himself. ""I'm thinking about [voting for Sanders],"" Brad Howell of Francestown, New Hampshire, told Slate at the Peterborough rally. But he's concerned that Sanders is not ""ultimately electable."" Why? The ""socialist"" label? His single-payer health care plan? ""It's hard to put a finger on it."" There is a vague cloud of unelectability hovering over Sanders, then, that he's compelled to address. Sanders does not enjoy speaking about horse-race garbage or really anything that diverts him away from his central issues of economic inequality and a political economy that's rigged by and for the billionaires. He is only doing so now because he must. That's why he's suddenly sounding so much like Donald Trump, who only likes to talk about polls, on the trail now. ""I am happy to report to you the results of a poll taken by WMUR and CNN, just the other day,"" Sanders said in Peterborough. ""Here are the results here in New Hampshire. In terms of Marco Rubio, Secretary Clinton loses to him by one point; I beat him here in New Hampshire by 18 points."" Loud applause. ""In terms of Mr. Kasich, it's a tie between Secretary Clinton and Gov. Kasich; I beat Kasich by 21 points."" More applause. He added that he tops Gov. Chris Christie as well, by a similar margin, while Clinton enjoys a modest lead. ""And my favorite,"" he said, allowing himself to enjoy the guilty pleasure of horse-race polling, ""the man who I would love, love, love to run against: Hillary Clinton defeats Trump by nine points. We defeat him by 23 points."" With that, the loudest applause of all. He added that the matchup numbers are also strong in Iowa and national polls and read some of those, too. Again: not that he thought any of this was particularly important. ""Now here's the other half of the story, which is actually more important,"" Sanders continued. ""I think it is fair to say ... that for Republicans to win--given their disastrous agenda, of denying the reality of climate change, of their desire to give huge tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires, of their desire to cut Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid--the way Republicans win elections is when the voter turnout is very low."" He described how ""abysmally low"" turnout was in the 2014 midterm elections, allowing Republicans to win a ""huge, landslide victory."" ""I believe that anyone who looks at Secretary Clinton's campaign and our campaign--objectively, in terms of the turnouts that we're seeing, in terms of the energy among working people and young people--will say, 'This is the campaign that has the energy, has the momentum, and can create a large voter turnout to bring us to victory.'"" This is the classic insurgent's argument. Look at the size of my crowds, the volunteers--we have the energy heading into the general election. But this still does not directly address the issue of how the Republican Party is salivating over the prospect of facing him or the obvious attacks coming his way. The second that it becomes clear Sanders has the Democratic nomination mathematically secure, the national Republican apparatus will launch 1,000 ads with a hammer and sickle superimposed over Sanders' face. The Soviet anthem will play, and words like ""$30 trillion socialist government takeover plan!"" in blinking text will appear. And, as Sen. Ted Cruz would say, that's just on Day One. What I'm getting at is that the critical early effort to define Sanders will be unsubtle. Will it work? How will he respond? Sanders' best electability argument is the abysmal track record of the chattering classes so far this cycle. Since the early conventional wisdom about the primaries has been so wrong--It'll be Jeb and Hillary in a walk!--perhaps the conventional wisdom about the general election will be equally bad. ""When we began this campaign about nine months ago, our candidacy was considered to be a 'fringe' candidacy. The media thought my hair was just beautiful, but other than that, they didn't think we had much of a chance,"" he said on Thursday. ""Well, the world has changed a little bit in the last nine months."" Read more of Slate's coverage of the 2016 campaign."	Why Bernie Sanders Is Starting to Sound a Little Like Donald Trump
4	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/islam_isn_t_inherently_violent_or_peaceful.html	"In the last five years the world's two-decade-long decline in political violence has stalled and been decisively reversed. Worldwide death tolls have risen at an astonishing rate--up more than 600 percent from 2010 to the end of 2014, according to Uppsala University's authoritative Conflict Data Program. The primary drivers of this startling change have been wars in which radical Islamist insurgents are one of the warring parties--Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Nigeria being the deadliest. As the slaughter has increased and spread internationally, so too have claims in the West that Islam--perceived as an inherently violent religion--has been its primary driver. Pushed by right-wing partisans, as well as some liberal critics, these claims have fanned a wave of strident, and sometimes violent, anti-Muslim sentiment across Europe and North America. A 2014 study by Pew Research found that in seven countries in Europe more than half of those polled held negative views of Muslims. A YouGov survey in the spring of 2015, following the Charlie Hebdo killings in France, found that 40 percent of those polled had negative opinions of Muslims. The savagery of the terror assaults perpetrated by ISIS and its franchise groups has helped build support for claims in the West that Islam is a religion of violence. But the faith of 1.8 billion Muslims, almost a quarter of the world's population, is far too complex and open to far too many competing interpretations, to be reduced to simplistic slogans like a ""religion of violence""--or indeed a ""religion of peace."" Islam is both. What is striking about the current debate is how extraordinarily little its participants appear to know about the extent of Muslim--and non-Muslim--violence. It appears, for example, that none of the anti-Muslim critics are aware that, with respect to the single greatest source of deadly intentional violence worldwide, Muslim societies are among the least violent in the world. This is not to deny the incontestable fact that campaigns of political violence in which Islamist radical groups--like ISIS--are one of the warring parties are now the world's deadliest--and by a huge margin. This reality might seem to lend credence to claims that Islam is indeed an inherently violent religion, but this is to confuse the ultra-violent ideology of a very small minority of Muslims at a particular point in time with the Islamic religion as it is understood and practiced today by the overwhelming majority of a billion-plus Muslims worldwide. This majority, of course, despises the gross brutality of ISIS, al-Qaida, and the other ultra-violent Islamist groups. The animus of mainstream Islam is hardly surprising--ISIS has mostly killed fellow Muslims. Given today's headlines, it may come as a surprise to learn that in the 1970s there were no major conflicts involving Islamist radicals being waged around the world. This raises an obvious question. If Islam is in fact an inherently violent religion, how do we account for these--and many other--long periods of peacefulness within Muslim societies? The reality is that Islam--like Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, and other major world religions--is neither inherently violent nor inherently peaceful. Like every other great religion, the history of Islam is darkened by periods of violent bloodletting. And the holy texts of all religions can be mined for quotes to legitimize terrorism--or indeed principled nonviolence. Thus ISIS and other extreme Islamist radicals have no difficulty finding justification in medieval Islamic texts for their ultra-violent ideology and barbaric practices. But these extreme interpretations have minimal support among Muslims around the world and tell us nothing about the propensity for violence in mainstream Islam. In October 2014, the first opinion polls on public attitudes toward ISIS were published in three Arab countries for the Fikra Forum. The findings were instructive. Just 3 percent of Egyptians held favorable views of ISIS. The figure for Saudi Arabia was 5 percent and for Lebanon less than 1 percent. A year later Pew Research found that just 1 percent of Lebanese held ""favorable opinions"" of ISIS, 3 percent in predominantly Sunni Jordan, and 1 percent in Israel. In the Palestinian territories the figure was 6 percent, but even here a massive 84 percent held unfavorable opinions of ISIS. Previous polls revealed very similar trends about Muslim opinions toward al-Qaida. Discussions about the violence of contemporary Islam focus overwhelmingly on armed conflict and terrorism. But a more appropriate metric for determining the propensity for violence of a particular society, culture, or religion is the incidence of intentional homicide. In almost all societies it is murder, not war, that accounts for the large majority of intentional killings. And perpetrating homicide, unlike embarking on wars or terror campaigns, does not require long preparation, intensive organization, a huge range of weaponry, complex logistics, political mobilization, intensive training, or a great deal of money--which is one reason why war and terrorism death tolls around the world are far smaller than the number of homicides. It is far more difficult to mount an armed campaign against a state than to kill an individual. And even today, wars directly affect only a relatively small minority of countries. All countries suffer from homicides, however. In 2015, the Global Burden of Armed Violence published by the Geneva-based Small Arms Survey, found that between 2007 and 2012, for every individual killed in war or terror campaigns around the world, seven individuals were murdered. Worldwide, for most people, in most countries, most of the time, murder is a far greater threat to human security than organized political violence. So if there really is an inherent--Islam-driven--propensity for deadly violence in Muslim societies, we should expect to find that the greater the percentage of Muslims in society, the greater would be the numbers of homicides. In fact, the reverse is the case: The higher the percentage of Muslims in a society, the lower the homicide rate. In 2011, a major study by University of California, Berkeley, political scientist M. Steven Fish presented cross-national statistical data showing that between 1994 and 2007, annual homicide rates in the Muslim world averaged just 2.4 per 100,000 of the population. That was approximately a third of the rate for the non-Muslim world and less than the average rate in Europe. It is also approximately half the homicide rate in the United States. In comparing individual countries, the difference is even greater. The latest homicide statistics from the U.N.'s Office on Drugs and Crime reveal that for every murder perpetrated in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim state, seven people are murdered in the United States. This reality should give American Islamophobes pause. It is possible in principle, as some critics have argued, that the lower murder rates in Muslim countries could be due not to a generally low propensity for homicide but to authoritarian governments whose harsh anti-violent crime policies are more effective in reducing the incidence of murder than those of democracies like the United States. But Fish's careful statistical analyses controlled for this possibility and found no evidence to support it. When it comes to war, Fish found no statistical evidence to support Samuel Huntington's controversial ""clash of civilizations"" thesis that Muslim societies are inherently more war-prone than non-Muslim states. Moreover, a lot depends on what type of war is being counted. A 2011 analysis by the Human Security Report looked at which states had fought most international wars--including colonial wars--since the end of World War II. The top four were France, Britain, Russia/Soviet Union, and the United States--in that order. No Muslim-majority country was in the top eight. Yet another metric for determining the violence-proneness of countries is the ""conflict year,"" the number of armed conflicts--civil as well as international--that a country experiences in a calendar year. Some particularly conflict-prone countries--Burma is the prime example--have frequently found themselves fighting several different wars in a single calendar year for decades. Here the Human Security Report found that the countries that had experienced most ""conflict years"" since the World War II were--in this order--Burma, India, Ethiopia, the Philippines, Britain, France, Israel, and Vietnam. Again no Muslim-majority country was in the top eight. Fish does not, however, claim that Muslim societies are less violent than those in the non-Muslim world with respect to all forms of deadly violence. Indeed, he points out that when it comes to terrorism, Islamist radicals were responsible for 70 percent of deaths from ""high-casualty terrorist bombings"" around the world between 1994 and 2008. This means, he suggests, that while terrorism is very far from being a uniquely Muslim phenomenon, ""... its perpetrators in recent times are disproportionately Islamists."" Since 2010, the incidence of Islamist terrorism has increased sharply. But in this context it is instructive to note that approximately 600 million of the world's 1.8 billion Muslims live in Southeast Asia and China, while a little more than half that number--317 million--live in the Middle East and North Africa. Yet the rate of deadly political violence associated with radical Islamist groups in Southeast Asian and China today is only a tiny fraction of that of the less populous Muslim states of the Middle East and North Africa region. Why should the level of political violence in the populations of these two regions differ so dramatically even though they share the same allegedly violence-prone religion? One possible answer is that religion is not the primary driver of conflict in these regions. In Southeast Asia, national governments in Muslim-majority countries have what political scientists call ""performance legitimacy""--meaning they deliver the goods and services that their citizens want. With few exceptions, the governments of their co-religionists in the Middle East and North Africa do not. In the radical Islamist conflicts that are tearing apart Syria, Iraq, and other parts of the region, the exclusionary politics, state repression, rights abuses, corruption, and incompetence of the regimes that the radicals have sought to overthrow provide more compelling insights into what drives the abhorrent violence of ISIS than does the extreme Islamist ideology that seeks to legitimize the killing. ISIS's narrow, extreme interpretation of medieval Islam has certainly influenced the gruesome forms that its violence takes--the gory beheadings, choreographed mass executions, immolations, crucifixions, the stoning of adulterers, and sexual slavery. But claims that the savagery of this tiny minority of the world's Muslims demonstrate that Islam itself is an inherently violent religion are supported by neither logic, history, nor any compelling contemporary evidence. But Islam is not an inherently peaceful religion either."	Why We Know Islam Isn't a Religion of Violence

Bernie Sanders entered the fray, few thought he would make a sustained and serious challenge to Hillary Clinton. But in the months since he launched his campaign he has exceeded expectations, winning liberal Democrats and charging toward victory in New Hampshire, and approaching it in Iowa. Now facing a truly competitive race, Team Clinton has reached for the sword, swinging against Sanders on everything from health care and gun control to his age and his electability, warning Democrats that his ""democratic socialism"" could cost them the election. On guns, they've landed blows, and they hope to do the same on his ability to win. On health care, by contrast, they've missed, frustrating liberal commentators and bringing new donations to Sanders' campaign. But the rapid rise of Sanders--and the pointed attacks from Clinton--obscure the extent to which the overall state of the race hasn't changed. Clinton is still the favorite for the nomination, even as her path gets a little rockier and a little more difficult. And the reason isn't hard to understand. Take the recent Monmouth University poll of the Democratic race. Between December and January, Clinton lost her lead with white Democrats. Indeed, it vanished, dropping 23 points. Now, she's tied with Sanders, 43 percent to 43 percent. But she's grown her lead with black and Latino Democrats, winning 71 percent to 21 percent for the Vermont senator, up from 61 percent in January. This lead with black and Latino Democrats isn't just responsible for Clinton's margin in national polling--where she outpaces Sanders by an average of 13 points--it's responsible for her massive lead in the South Carolina primary, where black voters predominate and where Clinton crushes Sanders with an average margin of 40 points (although there's been little polling in the state since the new year). Which gets to a broader, more important point. Minority voters--and black Americans in particular--are the firewall for Clinton's candidacy and the Democratic establishment writ large. As long as Clinton holds her lead with black Democrats, she's tough (if not impossible) to beat in delegate-rich states like New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Ohio, and Texas. Even with momentum from wins in Iowa and New Hampshire, it's hard to see how Sanders overcomes Clinton's massive advantage with this part of the party's electorate . That's not to say he won't excel as an insurgent candidate, but that--barring a seismic shift among black Democrats, as well as Latinos--his coalition won't overcome her coalition. This, in itself, raises a question. Why are black Americans loyal to Hillary Clinton? What has she, or her husband, done to earn support from black voters? After all, this is the era of Clinton critique, especially on questions of racial and economic justice. The Crime Bill of 1994 supercharged mass incarceration; the great economic boom of the 1990s didn't reach millions of poor and working-class black men; and welfare reform couldn't protect poor women in the recession that followed. And the lax regulation of the Clinton years helped fill a financial bubble that tanked the global economy and destroyed black wealth. At the same time, it is important to view the relationship between black voters and the Clintons in the context of the times when it was forged. During the Republican presidencies of the 1980s, black voters felt alienated and ignored by mainstream politics. Even Democrats seemed to keep their distance, a sense that helped fuel Jesse Jackson's bids for the Democratic nomination in 1984 and 1988. From the beginning of his campaign, Bill Clinton did the opposite. Neither he nor his wife took blacks for granted, assiduously campaigning for the black vote in every possible venue. He emphasized his childhood in the segregated South and pledged to appoint blacks to high-ranking positions. In an approach that Barack Obama would mimic 16 years later, Clinton focused his efforts on black civic and community organizations, from church networks to civil rights groups. It paid off. Black voters carried Clinton through the Southern primaries and gave him the margins he needed to win the nomination. To a large degree, Clinton's black outreach--premised on his background and his cultural familiarity--was symbolic. Put frankly, Clinton felt comfortable around black people and never tried to hide it. On the other hand, however, he never promised to directly address black interests and he--after winning the nomination--tried to distance himself from black activists (e.g. the ""Sistah Souljah moment""). But symbolic politics is potent, and black voters stuck with Clinton through the general election. This established a pattern, of sorts. Clinton would always rely on black voters as a base, cultivating their support and appealing to them throughout his presidency. When it suited the circumstances, however, he would distance himself. He wasn't a fair-weather friend, but he wasn't a reliable ally either. But what was true was the extent to which he treated black Americans as equal partners in national life. He addressed black concerns in national addresses like the State of the Union and worked with black leaders on priorities like the Crime Bill. Both Clintons made active efforts to appeal to and respect black voters, which was not the norm for American politics (although, with George W. Bush's ""compassionate conservativism,"" it became the norm, at least for a moment). All of this left a lasting impression. Black voters didn't always agree with Clinton, but they liked and--to an extent--trusted him. When Hillary ran for Senate, she took a similar approach, working hard to build ties to New York state's--and New York City's--black community. And this outreach informed Bill Clinton's (highly symbolic) decision to base his post-presidency in Harlem. For more than 20 years, Bill and Hillary Clinton have engaged with black voters, black leaders, and black communities. They're familiar. And when coupled with the role blacks play in the Democratic primary--stalwart voters who tend to support the safest choice--this adds up to a powerful advantage for Hillary. So much so that the only candidate to breach it--Barack Obama--had to run an almost flawless campaign, in addition to being black himself. Had Obama failed to build ties to the black political establishment--and had he failed to show his viability with wins among white Democrats--it's not clear he would have overcome and reversed Clinton's advantage with blacks. In the eight years since that fight, Hillary Clinton has worked to mend her rifts with black leaders and black voters. She joined the Obama administration and served with enthusiasm, she--and Bill--continued their retail outreach, speaking to black voters in black spaces. There's still work to do--the 2008 primary was ugly--but the Clintons are doing it. With expansive policies for economic equality, Sanders might have real appeal for black Americans. But it takes more than good policies to forge a political connection. It takes hard, dedicated work. And to overcome a decades-long relationship between black voters and the Clintons, it will take harder work still. This truth gets to a broader fact about where we are in the Democratic presidential primary. Clinton is a transactional politician who operates from the center of the Democratic Party. Sanders is an ideological politician who has worked, for his entire career, to push the Democratic Party to the left. Clinton is struggling to build enthusiasm for her campaign because it's hard to build excitement over a transaction. She can promise to fight for Democrats, she can promise to represent them, but she can't bring a ""political revolution."" But Sanders, as a possible nominee for the presidency, has the opposite problem. It is hard to transition from protesting the party establishment to trying to lead it. Whether he can do so--whether, in effect, he can become more transactional--will play a big part in his electoral success. If he can break or subvert Clinton's relationship with black Democrats, he can win. If he can't, he won't. Read more of Slate's coverage of the Democratic primary."

Ted Cruz, or Sen. Marco Rubio. Two-thirds of Republican voters support one of these three candidates. In nearly every Iowa poll, Trump, Cruz, and Rubio lead the pack. In political betting markets, they're drawing about 90 percent of the money. Cruz says the nomination is a two-man race between him and Trump. You might not love me, says the Texas senator, but I'm the only guy left who can beat Trump and save the GOP from disaster. Rubio offers a similar pitch: He's the electable Republican, the only alternative to a lousy choice between Trump and Cruz. The argument for Cruz or Rubio, in short, is really an argument against Trump: He's reckless, he's dangerous, he says crazy things. But there's a problem with this rationale. As both senators have noted, the most important thing a president can change by himself is foreign policy. In this case, he can revoke American participation in the biggest nuclear nonproliferation pact in almost 20 years: the 2015 agreement between six countries and Iran, which was formally implemented this weekend. And on that issue--the one that arguably matters most--Trump isn't crazy. Of the three leading Republicans, he's the only one who hasn't promised to revoke the Iran deal on his first day in office. Last March, even before the deal's terms were settled, Rubio pledged to revoke any agreement in which Iran retained a ""capability to enrich uranium."" In August, after the agreement was finished and signed, Cruz vowed to ""rip up and rescind this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal."" Trump bashed the agreement, too. But he didn't promise to revoke it. In August, a week after Cruz pledged to rip up the agreement, Trump explained why he wouldn't do the same:"	Is Donald Trump the Only Leading Republican We Can Trust on Iran?

8	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/chris_christie_isn_t_as_honest_with_voters_as_he_says_he_is.html	"Gov. Chris Christie's presidential campaign bets big on straightforwardness, or ""telling it like it is."" During Thursday night's debate, the Christie press operation sent out one press release after another highlighting how Christie was ""telling it like it is"" on any given subject he happened to be addressing: ""Telling It Like It Is On America's Role In The World,"" ""Telling It Like It Is On Entitlements,"" ""Telling It Like It Is On Criminal Justice Reform."" He's the tough dad who's going to make you eat the meatloaf your mother put so much effort into cooking, damnit, unless you want to be sent to bed early. He will talk about difficult things, like cutting Medicare and Social Security, and you won't like it, but the sheer force of his honest appraisals of the fiscal outlook will necessitate your submission. The problem with this self-presentation is that Christie, right now, may be the least honest candidate in the race. Christie is an exceptional performer. But as he's risen in New Hampshire polls, he's made himself a target for his fellow ""establishment"" rivals, each of whom is jockeying for that third ticket out of the Granite State. During the past couple of weeks, Christie rivals such as Sen. Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush have made hay over some of the more moderate positions Christie has taken to fuel his rise as a Republican leader in a blue state. Christie's responses have either been to obfuscate or, as he did Thursday night before millions of viewers, claim that he did not do what the public record makes clear he absolutely did, over and over. Christie's natural skills as a debater kept him afloat, but his mischaracterizations about his past will do far more damage in the long run--to whatever extent there is a long run for Christie's presidential campaign. Christie got the more memorable put-down against Rubio in the debate, when he told Rubio, ""You already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it,"" after Rubio had been criticizing some of Christie's past positions. But Rubio did not blow it! He made a number of factual statements about Christie from which the governor will have difficulty escaping: ""Unfortunately, Gov. Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood."" Let's run through each of these. ""Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey,"" Christie retorted. Christie was a strong supporter and early adopter of Common Core standards in his first term as governor, so already Rubio is correct in noting that Christie ""has endorsed"" the idea. When he decided he wanted to be president, he put the program under review. As Jessica Huseman writes for Slate, ""New Jersey is still using the exact same tests as before, ones that are aligned with the exact same Common Core standards for what students should master by each grade level,"" but he's just not calling it Common Core anymore. On gun control, Christie mentioned a number of the measures he has blocked. ""I have vetoed a .50-caliber rifle ban,"" he said. ""I have vetoed a reduction this clip size. I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners, and I pardoned six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges."" It wasn't always this way. When Christie campaigned in 2009, his campaign sent out a release saying he ""supports the assault weapons ban and all current gun laws."" He says now that he's ""changed his mind"" on guns and ""learned a great deal about guns"" since it became politically necessary to do so. He credits his ""experience as a federal prosecutor"" for the shift, which is interesting in two respects. He already picked up that ""experience as a federal prosecutor"" when he was campaigning in 2009 and supporting gun control measures such as the assault weapons ban. And in 2013, when he signed a bill barring people on the federal terrorism watch list from owning guns--something Democrats in Washington are pushing for right now on the federal level, to strenuous Republican objections--what did Christie cite as his justification? ""As a former federal prosecutor,"" he said in a ceremony, ""I understand the obligation of government to ensure the safety and security of its people."" ""I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor,"" he said Thursday night, flat-out. When asked on a radio show in 2009 whether he personally would have selected Sotomayor, Christie said, ""She wouldn't have been my choice, no."" Well, duh. He's a Republican. But he supported her confirmation anyway. ""I support her appointment to the Supreme Court and urge the Senate to keep politics out of the process and confirm her nomination,"" then-gubernatorial candidate Christie said in a July 2009 statement. ""Qualified appointees should be confirmed and deserve bi-partisan support. Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito deserved that support based on their work as Circuit Court Judges. So does Judge Sotomayor. As a result, I support her confirmation."" As for ""the donation he made to Planned Parenthood,"" at issue is a quote from 1994 to the Star-Ledger when Christie was running for county office and was asked about public funding for Planned Parenthood, which he opposed due to budget constraints. ""I support Planned Parenthood privately with my personal contribution and that should be the goal of any such agency, to find private donations,"" he said. Christie doesn't lie about having been previously pro-choice, but he has little explanation for the ""I support Planned Parenthood privately with my personal contribution"" line. ""I'm convinced it was a misquote,"" he told the Washington Post's Jennifer Rubin in an interview this week. So, let's review Rubio's quote again: ""Unfortunately, Gov. Christie has endorsed many of the ideas that Barack Obama supports, whether it is Common Core or gun control or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood."" Whether you consider these things important or not, Rubio's quote appears to be true based on Christie's past statements and actions. Some are still entertaining the idea that Christie could be a viable ""establishment"" candidate if he can overtake Rubio and somehow pull off at least a second-place finish in New Hampshire. But the guy's only barely begun to get torn apart by his competitors, and the stack of potential attacks--and Christie's insufficient responses to them--is mounting.

9	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/gop_presidential_candidates_have_a_paranoid_fear_of_gun_laws_and_gun_confiscation.html	"Halfway through Thursday's prime-time Republican presidential debate, Sen. Ted Cruz joked: ""In any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment. Unless you are clinically insane, that's what you say in a primary."" The audience laughed. But you don't have to oppose the Second Amendment to be off your rocker. There's another kind of mental illness, and Thursday's debates showed how fully it permeates the GOP. It's a paranoid fear of gun laws and gun confiscation. I'm not a gun owner. I'm also not persuaded that the restrictions President Obama has proposed would significantly reduce firearm violence. But even from a neutral perspective, what the candidates said on Thursday was madness. No matter what evidence was presented, they insisted that guns should be unregulated and that the government was preparing to confiscate them. Here's some of what they asserted. 1. There should be no gun laws. In the prime-time debate, Cruz bragged about leading the fight against legislation that would have required universal background checks on gun purchases. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie touted his own list: ""I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban. I have vetoed a reduction [in] clip size. I vetoed a statewide ID system for gun owners."" Christie added, ""In New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal-and-carry permit."" But the winner of the bidding war was Donald Trump. Debate co-moderator Maria Bartiromo asked Trump, ""Are there any circumstances that you think we should be limiting gun sales of any kind in America?"" Without hesitation, Trump replied, ""No."" 2. Gun laws are inherently futile. Sen. Marco Rubio told the prime-time audience that Obama's gun-control proposals wouldn't have prevented recent mass shootings because ""criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show. They don't buy their guns from a collector. And they don't buy their guns from a gun store. They get--they steal them. They get them on the black market."" That's not true: Dozens of mass shooters bought their weapons at gun stores. But Rubio's claim goes beyond these incidents. It's an argument against all gun laws. 3. Guns are our only defense against terrorism. Trump blamed the deaths of 130 people in Paris and 14 more in San Bernardino, California, on the victims' lack of guns. Rubio went further, suggesting that Americans should arm themselves against terrorists. ""We are in a war against ISIS,"" said Rubio. ""They are trying to attack us here in America. They attacked us in Philadelphia last week. They attacked us in San Bernardino. ... And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun."" 4. Obama deliberately targets innocent people. When Obama ""meets with the attorney general in the White House,"" said Rubio, the president's instructions are to ""give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns."" 5. Democrats will abolish the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment has been around for 224 years. In 2008, the Supreme Court affirmed that it protects the right to own a handgun and to possess a rifle or shotgun without a trigger lock. The right to own long guns wasn't even disputed in the case, and there are presently about 300 million firearms in the United States. Nevertheless, on Thursday, Cruz and Rubio warned that Obama or Hillary Clinton would find a way to take everyone's guns. ""I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would,"" said Rubio. ""I have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it."" Cruz predicted that if Clinton is elected, the Supreme Court ""will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment, and the government could confiscate your guns."" 6. Thriving gun sales are proof that guns are threatened. Neil Cavuto, a co-moderator of the prime-time debate, asked Rubio, ""What fact can you point to that the president would take away everyone's gun?"" Cavuto pointed out that during Obama's tenure, ""Gun sales have more than doubled."" Rubio replied: ""That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away."" The audience applauded. 7. Polls that favor gun laws are bogus. In the undercard debate, co-moderator Trish Regan noted, ""Recent polls show the majority of Americans are in favor of universal background checks."" Former Sen. Rick Santorum replied: ""Not in this room."" Regan explained that she was citing a fact, not her opinion. ""It's the poll data,"" she said. At that point, another candidate, Carly Fiorina, incredulously retorted: ""And we all believe the polling data all the time, don't we?"" The audience applauded. 8. Ignore executive orders. Sandra Smith, another co-moderator of the undercard debate, reminded former Gov. Mike Huckabee, ""You called President Obama's executive orders on gun control unconstitutional and completely insane."" ""Yes, I did,"" replied Huckabee. Smith continued: ""You even told gun store owners to ignore the president's orders."" Again, the crowd applauded. Guns are a complex issue. People do use firearms to protect themselves, and criminals do buy guns on the black market. In other contexts--notably, marijuana and abortion--liberals are less credulous that restrictive laws will change behavior or do more good than harm. But what we heard from the Republican candidates on Thursday wasn't a nuanced critique of gun laws. It was a web of extremism, denial, and paranoia that in any other setting would be recognized as mental illness. Without an adjudicated diagnosis, you can't stop such people from buying weapons. But you can certainly stop them from becoming president of the United States. Read more of Slate's GOP primary coverage."	GOP Presidential Candidates Have a Paranoid Fear of Almost All Gun Laws
10	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/why_ted_cruz_and_donald_trump_are_still_winning.html	"Thursday night's Republican debate in South Carolina was the culmination of every nightmare establishment Republicans have had since Donald Trump entered the race in June. From the instant Trump rocketed to the top of opinion polls soon after he began campaigning, party bigwigs and more moderate primary voters have been waiting for the moment when sanity would finally rear its head: Trump would eventually see his numbers drop--along with Sen. Ted Cruz's and Ben Carson's, for that matter--as voters got serious, the expectation went. Those voters would carefully evaluate the men (and woman) running and choose the person with the proper temperament and experience. But with the Iowa caucus barely more than two weeks away, Republican voters remain uninterested in typical credentials or establishment connections. And thanks to Thursday's debate, we also now know that the so-called insurgent candidates are more skillful at politics, too. Trump and Cruz were again the winners in the actual forum, and it's still not clear what is going to stop them from winning when the actual voting starts. The expectations that debates might do in Trump now seem silly in retrospect. It's not as if nonestablishment candidates have never been adept on debate stages. Newt Gingrich was a superb debater, and those performances helped him in his 2012 nomination fight against Mitt Romney, before he was buried under a big, fat pile of campaign cash. On the other hand, Cruz is extremely well-funded; Trump doesn't really need money, given his gift for free publicity and personal wealth; and neither man has displayed any of Gingrich's glaring political weaknesses. In short, they are probably not going to be defeated with television ads. But as Thursday's debate showed, they probably aren't going to be defeated onstage, either. When Cruz and Trump started really going after each other early in the debate, it appeared that they could in fact inflict--and suffer--some serious wounds. Normally two-man combat hurts both combatants and helps someone else in the field. (John Kerry and John Edwards both benefited greatly in 2004 when Howard Dean and Dick Gephardt tore each other apart in Iowa.) But the back-and-forths Thursday night showed both men to be engaged and politically capable, skillful in their answers and acute in the way they appealed to the base. Cruz's debating skills have at this point been picked over endlessly, but they really are almost creepily impressive. From the first question of the night, when he initially ignored an answer on jobs by decrying the recent naval incident in Iran (facts be damned), and then got extra time to talk about jobs anyway, he was entirely on his game. When he was questioned about a recent New York Times story detailing a loan his Senate campaign received (and didn't report) from Goldman Sachs, he brilliantly pivoted to an attack on the Times itself. When it came to his spats with Trump, he initially seemed to deliver some damaging blows. He attacked Trump over the latter's embrace of ""New York values"" and was articulate in beating back against the birther controversy that Trump has dredged up. But each time Trump responded well, once going into a surprisingly heartfelt (for Trump) remembrance of what New York City was like after 9/11. A later answer from the businessman on why he's so angry was perfect red meat for Republicans voters. Trump's ability to display rather than ""feel"" other people's anger probably explains a good deal of his appeal among a Republican electorate that has simply gotten angrier the more years Barack Obama has been in office. And his political learning curve, in the limited amount of time he has been campaigning and debating, is simply remarkable. The other men onstage had their occasional moments but didn't appear to be in the same league. Sen. Marco Rubio remains the most polished of the field, but the anger he displayed in this debate felt practiced and phony. (He did get in some good attacks on Cruz's record, but they occurred very late in the debate and after an attack he launched against Cruz on taxes seemed to fizzle.) Neither New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie nor Ohio Gov. John Kasich made much of an impression. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush tried to take on Trump's promise to ban Muslims from entering the United States, but he was essentially reduced to arguing that bigotry was bad because, well, some of our allies are Muslim. Trump remains well ahead in national polls, while Cruz is clinging to a narrow lead in Iowa. If the Texas senator were to win there, he could even finish second in New Hampshire--where Trump is ahead--and potentially cement his lead over his more moderate rivals. It wasn't supposed to be this way. And perhaps, in the end, it won't be: Rubio still has a good chance at the nomination. But the idea that once voters began paying attention they would turn away from the less serious candidates was dependent on the idea that Cruz and Trump would seem less serious to Republican voters. For seven months, we've waited for these guys to see their support collapse. Thursday's debate not only kept them riding high; it also demonstrated why they may stay aloft for a long, long time.

Ted Cruz and Donald Trump acted out a debate almost verbatim that they've been having across separate radio interviews the past couple of days regarding Trump's supposed ""New York values."" And, at least on Thursday night, Trump got the better of Cruz. Moderator Neil Cavuto asked Cruz to elaborate on his statement that Trump ""embodies"" New York values. ""I think most people know exactly what New York values are,"" Cruz responded. Well, Ted, there are a couple of implications there, and he went with both. ""Everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro-gay marriage."" Check. ""Focus around money and the media."" Check. That allowed Trump, as he has in radio interviews this week, to wield the one single time that conservatives have ever shown solidarity with New York City, Sept. 11, against Cruz. He did it well. ""New York is a great place. It's got great people. It's got loving people, wonderful people,"" Trump began. ""When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York. You had two""--an interruption for applause, including from Cruz--""You had two 110-story buildings come crashing down."""	"Trump Turns ""New York Values"" Against Cruz"

Thursday night's Fox Business debate in Charleston, South Carolina, could actually play a key role in influencing voters in the critical early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. With these potentially heightened stakes, partisans from all sides will be watching carefully to immediately point out if anyone slips up or appears to take a step ahead in the nominating fight. Below are live tweets, drawn from a list of top political accounts curated by Slate. Those who lean left are on the left; those who lean right are on the right. Enjoy the instant spin!	Here's How Liberals and Conservatives Are Spinning the Republican Debate
13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/a_glossary_to_marco_rubio_s_favorite_words_in_a_kinder_gentler_gop_culture.html	"Marco Rubio has found religion. For most of last year, the Florida senator campaigned for president as a foreign policy expert and as a fresh-faced student of the high-tech economy. But to compete with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in Iowa and South Carolina, Rubio needs a family-values pitch. So, a month ago, Rubio began to spice up his stump speech with more talk of faith and morals. Unlike Cruz, Rubio doesn't enjoy conflict or feel comfortable demonizing others. He frets about being called a ""bigot,"" ""homophobe,"" or ""chauvinist."" And he knows that legislating morality, particularly around sex, can drive many voters away. Rubio wants a kinder, gentler version of the culture wars. Toward that end, he's developing a repertoire of words and phrases that repackage social issues in a less threatening way. Here's a glossary of his favorite terms. Cling. Rubio says President Obama despises conservatives who ""cling to their guns and to their religion."" He's right that Obama used that phrase in 2008. For Obama, cling meant that conservatives held fast to traditions in a time of economic turmoil and suffering. But for Rubio, cling means that while you're trying to hold onto your values, Obama is trying to rip them away. According to Rubio, Obama is ""obsessed with taking away religious liberty and the Second Amendment."" Hateful. Ever since Donald Trump proposed a ban on Muslim refugees, Republicans have worried about appearing xenophobic. Rubio says that's a bum rap. ""If you say you want to limit or restrict the number of refugees that can come in, [liberals] say that that's hateful,"" he complains. But it's not, he argues, because ISIS is trying to infiltrate the refugees. When you bar the refugees, you're not being mean. You're just being practical. Hollywood. Thirty years ago, conservatives were accused of trying to censor music and movies. Rubio doesn't want to come off that way. He wants to be a hip 21st-century guy. So he reverses the story: Pop culture filth is the aggressor, and Christians are just trying to shield themselves from it. ""My wife Jeanette and I are raising four children in the 21st century,"" he says. ""And we have to work harder every year to instill in them the values that they teach in my church, instead of the values that Hollywood and the media [are] trying to ram down our throats."" Judgmental. Rubio says leftists view ""people with traditional values with great suspicion, as outdated, judgmental people,"" as ""people who look down on, or don't like, people that aren't like them."" He insists that this perception is false. His objection seems odd, since values are meant to be applied in judging behavior. But for Rubio, judgmental means looking down on others. It's an attitude, not an evaluation. And it's unseemly. Love. According to Rubio, this is why conservatives want to keep out refugees: ""You don't lock your doors because you hate people on the outside. You lock the doors because you love the people on the inside."" This is a handy rationale for any kind of exclusion. Don't feel bad about what you're doing to Muslims. Feel good about what you're doing for Christians. Outdated. Rubio uses this term in conjunction with judgmental and hater. Example: ""If you believe in traditional marriage today, you're called bigot, an outdated hater."" This adds a fashion offense to the left's unfair indictment of conservatives. Liberals aren't just impugning your character. They're saying something even worse: that you're passe. Respect, tolerance. ""We've always been a tolerant people,"" says Rubio. ""But that also includes the opportunity to exercise your values, to teach them in your home and to live them in your life."" Respect, likewise, is a two-way street: ""I respect people that disagree with me on certain things. But they have to respect me, too. Just because I believe that states should have the right to define marriage in the traditional way does not make me a bigot."" Rubio uses these terms not just to demand reciprocity, but to enlarge the space in which conservatives can apply their values. Liberals have to respect your right not only to live as husband and wife, but also to ""define marriage"" for everyone else in your state. Stigmatize. ""We have a society that stigmatizes those who hold cultural values that are traditional,"" says Rubio. He complains that advocates of same-sex marriage ""want to stigmatize, they want to ostracize anyone who disagrees with them."" By using these terms, Rubio casts conservatives as the true victims: It's those intolerant homosexuals who are stigmatizing us for innocently objecting to their lifestyle. Their own country. This is Rubio's money phrase. He uses it in ads, debates, and speeches. ""A growing number of Americans feel like outsiders in their own country, out of place in their own nation,"" he lamented recently in South Carolina. In Iowa, he said: ""They don't recognize their own country anymore."" Officially, Rubio is talking about conservative Christians. Unofficially, the phrase resonates with whites who sense a diffusion of ethnic power. But the key term is country. It implies that you're entitled to the company of a like-minded majority, not just in your home or your neighborhood, but in the whole United States. Traditional values. In Rubio's vocabulary, this is code for opposing gay marriage. Polls have turned against Republicans on this issue, so they need a term that makes the reference clear to conservative Christians but opaque to everyone else. Sometimes Rubio uses the term traditional marriage. Sometimes he drops the ""marriage"" part altogether. War on women. Rubio has a hard-line position on abortion: He thinks it should be illegal even in cases of rape or incest. That seems harsh to many people, so he doesn't talk about it. Instead, he complains, ""If you're pro-life, they say that you're waging a war on women."" The real harshness, he implies, is coming from leftists who want to stir up a war with people who are guilty of nothing more than loving babies. On the campaign trail, these terms work for Rubio. He's plainly comfortable with them. For all his bravado about foreign policy and the use of force, he's a nicer person than Cruz or Trump. In the course of sucking up to conservative Christians, he doesn't want to alienate or offend secular Americans. He needs a moral vocabulary that's sharp enough to get him through the Republican primaries but friendly enough to soften his edges in a general election. He's off to a good start.

14	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/hillary_clinton_is_using_gop_fear_tactics_against_bernie_sanders_health.html	"Welcome to the campaign trail, Chelsea Clinton. Got anything on your mind? ""Sen. Sanders wants to dismantle Obamacare, dismantle the CHIP program, dismantle Medicare, and dismantle private insurance,"" she said in New Hampshire on Tuesday. ""I worry if we give Republicans Democratic permission to do that, we'll go back to an era--before we had the Affordable Care Act--that would strip millions and millions and millions of people off their health insurance."" The Hillary Clinton presidential campaign is in serious danger of losing both Iowa and New Hampshire, and this dire--though by no means fatal--situation is reflected in its new, aggressive posture toward her challenger, Sen. Bernie Sanders. Her attacks are largely coming on two fronts: Sanders' dicey history on certain gun control votes and his support for single-payer health care. While her criticisms of the former come from the left, her assault on the latter comes from the right, and it homes directly on a long-sought policy idea treasured by Democratic voters. The arguments her campaign is using against single-payer health care are earning plenty of griping from progressives, who see this as proof that Clinton will only play nice with them until the precise second that turning on them becomes politically advantageous. So why does the Clinton campaign now consider attacking single payer so politically advantageous? In short, it's the not-unfounded belief that once voters--even Democrats--hear more about what the implementation of single payer would entail, they'll get cold feet. Though the Sanders campaign might roll its eyes at the misleading nature of Clinton's attacks, it should treat this as an opportunity to have that debate, since it needs to be had, and won, when it eventually is brought up against the Republicans who will make the exact scare arguments that Clinton is making now. The Sanders plan that the Clinton campaign is attacking is a 2013 piece of single-payer, or ""Medicare for all,"" legislation that he introduced. The bill would have folded existing insurance programs into state-run single-payer systems, in which the government covers all medical costs, effectively eliminating the private insurance industry. It would have paid for the proposal, as I wrote when Clinton first started wielding this attack in the fall, by levying a ""2.2 percent tax on individuals making up to $200,000 or couples making up to $250,000, and progressively increasing that rate to 5.2 percent for income beyond $600,000."" Sanders' 2013 plan ""also would have tacked an extra 6.7 percent payroll tax on the employer side, at least some""--or all--""of which employers would likely pass on to workers."" The Clinton campaign approaches Sanders' strategy through a clever-but-not-really tactic of dressing up standard right-wing arguments against socialized health insurance as from the left. Sanders' 2013 plan would have only ""dismantled"" existing health insurance programs in the sense that it would roll them into a new one in which everyone has medical coverage. Saying that it would ""dismantle Medicare"" is a truly head-spinning way of describing a plan that would enroll everyone in Medicare. The plan would indeed have raised taxes by an effective 8.9 percent on most individuals, and higher for those at the top--but no one would be paying insurance premiums anymore. The idea is that public, universal health insurance works out cheaper on net since the government would have lower actuarial and administrative costs, more leverage to negotiate medical costs with providers, and no profit expectations to meet. As for the Clinton campaign's talk about how Sanders' single-payer plan would have put each state single-payer system in the hands of Republican governors who could reject them, Sanders' policy director tells the Week that they would be like Obamacare's individual exchanges: If a state doesn't set one up, the federal government would do it for them. (The Sanders campaign may also change this structure in its supposedly forthcoming new plan.) Clinton is a health policy wonk and fully understands these arguments, but she and her campaign are nevertheless describing the plan as one in which apparently no one has access to medical coverage anymore but does, just for the hell of it, pay an additional 9 percent in taxes. These talking points do not endear Clinton to progressives who were already inclined to believe that her otherwise leftward posture this primary has been a temporary pose and that she will do anything to win. But instead of just griping about Clinton's play, single-payer supporters should meet her challenge head on--because it is a challenge. The most common refrain I've been hearing from progressives in the past 24 or so hours is that it is electorally insane for Clinton to be using this particular tack, since single payer is so universally popular among Democrats. A December 2015 tracking poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation, for example, shows that 81 percent of Democrats either strongly or somewhat favor ""having a national health plan in which all Americans would get their insurance through an expanded, universal form of Medicare-for-all."" Support remains high, too, among independents and even Republicans. The political trouble comes, and would come if ever there were a push from President Bernie Sanders, when you start filling out what an ""expanded, universal form of Medicare-for-all"" means. First, it does mean the ""dismantling"" of private insurance. A lot of people like their employer-sponsored health insurance plans, even if they're not the most cost-effective means of health care financing. Part of why Obamacare is so convoluted yet incremental in effect is that it went out of its way not to mess with the employer-sponsored health insurance system out of political necessity. Second, everyone would have to see a tax hike. Though the savings in eliminated premiums might outweigh the increases in taxes, as well as make people's lives a lot easier, the prospect of higher taxes is still one that would give many initial supporters second thoughts about moving forward. Consider what happened when Vermont tried to institute a single-payer system. As PolitiFact wrote in a 2009 review of polling on single-payer health care, so much of these polls hinge on the wording, which indicates how malleable public opinion is on the issue. ""Words matter. Drop in the words 'like Medicare' and some polls have found the public responds better. People generally like Medicare,"" they wrote. ""Call it universal health care run by the government, and you often do better than calling it 'single-payer.' And if you call it a 'socialized' system, well, you can guess the results."" Or, as another expert described the politics of single payer in 2008:"	Hillary Clinton Is Using GOP Fear Tactics Against Bernie Sanders' Health Care Plan
15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/the_gop_establishment_is_pretending_to_warm_to_donald_trump.html	"Over the past week or so, a belief has begun to gain real traction that the Republican Party ""establishment"" has warmed to the possibility of Donald Trump as its presidential nominee. This is predicated on the scenario that the nomination comes down to Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz, whom Republican leaders personally dislike and consider unelectable to boot. A central figure in the Trump-acceptance movement is former presidential nominee and Senate majority leader Bob Dole, the erstwhile Republican establishment standard-bearer who is now just another elderly person in Kansas. Dole, the New York Times reports, warned of ""cataclysmic"" and ""wholesale losses"" if Cruz wins the nomination. Trump, by contrast, could stop Cruz, and if he wins the general election, could ""probably work with Congress, because he's, you know, he's got the right personality and he's kind of a deal-maker."" Is this really how they feel? Or is it just a means of stopping the immediate problem: an Iowa victory for Cruz, who led the state's polling just long enough to solidify the conventional wisdom that he needs to win it? To me, this is very likely a feint from establishment Republicans for one important reason: They don't directly address Trump's electability, which, like Cruz's, remains poor. General-election-matchup polling this early comes with many caveats--the fact that the general-election campaign is still six months away, notably. And we should expect that the instant Trump were to win the nomination, he would move to rebrand himself as a lifelong pro-choice feminist Latino. But those early matchup numbers are still awful--and worse than Cruz's--because Trump has gone to great lengths to viscerally alienate so many demographic groups and has certain ... let's say, temperament issues. It may be that members of the Republican establishment, in their trolling of Cruz, don't address Trump's own electability because they recognize it for what it is. ""Of course, this willingness to accommodate Mr. Trump is driven in part by the fact that few among the Republican professional class believe he would win a general election,"" the New York Times reported in a separate piece about the establishment's supposed detente with the mogul. ""In their minds it would be better to effectively rent the party to Mr. Trump for four months this fall, through the general election, than risk turning it over to Mr. Cruz for at least four years, as either the president or the next-in-line leader for the 2020 nomination."" There's the tell. Are we really to think that the Republican Party establishment has already come to terms with losing this election? The purpose of the Republican Party establishment is not primarily ideological; it is to win elections for the Republican Party so that the Republican Party will have more ability to do the bidding of the interest groups that prop it up. If the establishment was already prepared to lose the election, they'd be better off going with Cruz to at least scratch the conservative movement's itch for one of their own as the nominee in order to prove that this path won't actually work. In reality, the Republican establishment wants to win this election. I don't want to give GOP elites too much credit now, given how incompetently they've managed the cycle so far, but it looks like they're making an honest-to-goodness ""play"" here. Some might even call it a ""strategy."" The most appropriate term, though, would be ""moonshot."" Their first objective is to take out Cruz. That means stopping him in Iowa. If he loses Iowa, a narrative sets in about how he blew it, and he might then finish out of the top three in New Hampshire. From there, he would likely not be able to make the dominant sweep through the South over the next month that his delegate strategy requires. If we look at Cruz's Iowa trend line over the past week as he's been taking incoming fire from all sides, it seems that this part of the plan is working. The second objective, and a much longer-term one, is to take out Trump. Trump's Iowa win would likely ice his New Hampshire victory. But if Cruz's Iowa loss takes him out of the running for second place in New Hampshire, that silver medal would likely go to Sen. Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Gov. John Kasich, or Gov. Chris Christie. Rubio would seem to have the edge following a likely third-place Iowa finish that Bush's super PAC has been trying so hard to deny him. And if Rubio finished second in New Hampshire, the other three establishment-acceptable candidates who've pinned their hopes on New Hampshire would face overwhelming pressure to drop out. Rubio consolidates that voting bloc, holds his water against Trump through the South, scoops up the larger, more moderate winner-take-all states beginning March 15, becomes the nominee, and crushes Hillary Clinton by a trillion electoral votes. Do you spot the flaw? It is found in the screaming disconnect between these two ideas: We are talking about a strategy that cedes Trump the long sought Iowa-New Hampshire double and a dozen or so additional states over the course of a month ... and then bets on Trump losing the nomination. And losing it, at that, to someone like Rubio or Bush. Does the Republican establishment, after seeing all that it's seen so far this cycle, still operate under the impression that Trump would lose in a head-to-head matchup to either Rubio or Bush, something directly contradicted by recent polling? It's a moonshot, all right. But it may be their last available option to salvage a race that they never had control of in the first place. The party's best bet is still one that's out of their hands: that masses of people who intend to vote for Trump get into a voting booth, look at the ballot, and think, Jesus Christ, am I really about to vote for Donald Trump to be president? (Of course those votes could be canceled out by the bloc of voters who go into the booth intending to vote for a ""serious"" candidate like Bush and then think, LOL, whatever, I'm voting Trump because it will be hilarious.) The strategy will probably not work. But the Republican Party has to try something. And until Trump has the nomination secure, do not treat any reports about how the establishment is hunky-dory with Trump at face value. Read more of Slate's coverage of the GOP primary."	Why the GOP Establishment Is Pretending to Warm to Donald Trump
16	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/gop_elites_prefer_donald_trump_to_ted_cruz.html	"Donald Trump is a nativist demogogue who attacks racial and religious minorities and heaps praise on authoritarian leaders abroad. He borrows from white nationalists and channels the worst impulses in American life. He's an opportunist with little connection to the Republican Party or the conservative movement. If he has a serious rival for the GOP presidential nomination, it's Ted Cruz, the caustic senator from Texas. Cruz is a genuine ideologue, with deep support in the ""counter-establishment"" of conservative activists and right-wing billionaires. But he's also been a commissar of sorts in the GOP, blasting fellow Republicans for any deviation--real or perceived--from orthodoxy and leading the party in an almost self-destructive charge against the Affordable Care Act and the Obama administration. Trump is vulgar, but singular--he stands for no one but himself. Cruz, however, represents a faction of the GOP with real enemies in the party. And if he wins, he brings that faction to power. Which means that in official Washington--where Cruz is a pariah--the choice is easy. ""I've come around a little bit on Trump,"" said Sen. Orrin Hatch in an interview with CNN. ""I'm not so sure we'd lose if he's our nominee because he's appealing to people who a lot of the Republican candidates have not appealed to in the past."" ""We can live with Trump,"" said one Republican lobbyist to the New York Times. ""Do they all love Trump? No. But there's a feeling that he is not going to layer over the party or install his own person. Whereas Cruz will have his own people there."" ""You can coach Donald. If he got nominated he'd be scared to death,"" explained Charles Black, a former GOP operative, to the Times. ""That's the point he would call people in the party and say, 'I just want to talk to you.' "" John Feehery, a former Republican congressional aide, put it simply. ""Trump won't do long-lasting damage to the GOP coalition,"" he said to the Times. ""Cruz will."" As professional Republican pundits, operatives, and lawmakers, these figures care about the health of the party and their place in it. They want to win, and they want to preserve their influence. Trump appears malleable. Win or lose, they see themselves as safe. Cruz, on the other hand, is a threat. An unapologetic ideologue, Cruz isn't interested in outreach to the other side. Instead, he believes he can win by generating a wave of conservative enthusiasm. If Americans tend to punish naked extremism at the ballot box, then Cruz could cost the GOP the White House in a close election. And worse, as Feehery suggests, he could damage the party in Senate and congressional races. But beyond winning or losing, an ascendant Cruz brings a new class of conservative activists to Washington, who might displace the present establishment. In that sense, Cruz is an existential threat. But the mood is different among conservative intellectuals. For them, Trump--who escews conservatism in favor of an aggressive ethno-nationalism--is the existential threat. It's why, on Thursday, National Review published a symposium titled ""Against Trump,"" where a cross-section of conservative writers and personalities made the case against the Donald for a conservative audience. Whether or not it's effective--how many Trump supporters read and heed National Review?--it's an important signal from another set of party elites. At the same time, it's a flawed one. To defeat an enemy, you have to understand him, and it's not clear that any of the writers in National Review's symposium understand Trump or the forces in their party and movement that sustain him. More than anything, they attacked him for his ideology, or lack thereof. ""Trump is no conservative--he's simply playing one in the primaries,"" wrote Mona Charen. ""[V]irtually every Republican presenting himself to voters swears so-help-me-God that he is a conservative,"" wrote Brent Bozell, ""Many of these politicians are calculating, cynical charlatans. ... Trump might be the greatest charlatan of them all."" Under all of this is the assumption that Republican voters are conservatives first, driven by conservative principles. And to an extent, that's true. But it's self-serving to ignore, or deny, the extent to which Republican voters have been mobilized and organized by the politics of white backlash, and the degree to which conservative organs like National Review have been active participants in the process. The classic example is William F. Buckley's infamous 1957 editorial, ""Why the South Must Prevail,"" where the National Review founder and premier conservative intellectual made the case against the civil rights movement. ""The central question that emerges,"" writes Buckley, ""is whether the White community in the South is entitled to take such measures as are necessary to prevail, politically and culturally, in areas in which it does not predominate numerically. The sobering answer is Yes--the White community is so entitled because, for the time being, it is the advanced race."" White backlash politics informed Richard Nixon's 1968 campaign (where he lifted George Wallace's rhetoric, wholesale), Ronald Reagan's 1980 campaign (where he called the Voting Rights Act ""humiliating to the South""), and George H.W. Bush's 1988 bid for the presidency (see: ""Willie Horton""). In recent years, they've fueled the career of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, herself elevated to the national stage by prominent conservative intellectuals. Indeed, from affect to appeal, Palin is an important antecedent to Trump. Which gets to the irony of this apparent divide in the Republican Party elite, between those who might back Trump and those who disdain him. Conservative intellectuals--in terminal denial over the role of race in their movement--can't see how Trump flows naturally from undercurrents and strategies in conservative politics and conservative rhetoric. The white backlash to liberal identity politics helped build the modern Republican Party, and now--in its most virulent form--it is consuming its host. Republican officeholders and operatives, by contrast, are far more clear-eyed. As crafters and practitioners, they see Trump as a malleable force, using rhetoric that isn't too far from their own. If harnessing an aggressive white backlash is what it takes to win, so be it. And if Trump proves too alienating, then they can disavow him. Or at least, that's what they hope. Here, National Review is right. If Republicans embrace Trump, there's no going back. His brand of nativist politics will ascend in the GOP and transform conservatism from a movement of principles (that has harnessed resentment) to one of just resentment, all in the face of a diverse and broadly tolerant public. Like some alien symbiote, Republicans will shape Trump for just a brief time before Trumpism--as a political force--has the last word. Read more of Slate's coverage of the GOP primary."	Why GOP Elites Prefer Trump to Cruz
17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/national_review_s_conservatives_against_trump_symposium_makes_the_case_against.html	"Over the past few weeks, conservatives have been weighing what to say and what to do about the seemingly unstoppable rise of Donald Trump. While some have embraced the reality TV star turned GOP candidate, others are mounting a spirited resistance. This week, National Review, the magazine where I proudly hang my hat, published an editorial declaring that Trump did not deserve conservatives' support. The magazine also put together a symposium in which various conservative luminaries--Erick Erickson, Yuval Levin, John Podhoretz, and many more--made their own arguments against Trump's candidacy. The conservative case against Trump is straightforward. His opinions are famously idiosyncratic, and in the space of a few short years, he has gone from backing a single-payer health system to railing against Obamacare. In an earlier political incarnation, he called for a massive wealth tax aimed at millionaires and billionaires. Now, he favors deep cuts in corporate taxes that would greatly enrich millionaires and billionaires. As recently as 2013, Trump embraced the idea of an amnesty for unauthorized immigrants. Today, Trump's opposition to amnesty is the centerpiece of his presidential campaign. Can conservatives trust this man? Even the most passionate Trump devotees can hardly fault National Review for concluding otherwise. Nevertheless, Trump's candidacy does have a unifying theme: nostalgia. In seeking to ""Make America Great Again,"" he is offering an appeal to the past, when America was a nation of winners. Apart from opposing amnesty for unauthorized immigrants and favoring a reduction of less-skilled immigration, Trump pledges to fight offshoring, to renegotiate or simply tear up various free trade deals, and to bring America's industrial heartland back to life. As Ben Domenech, publisher of the Federalist, writes in his contribution to National Review's anti-Trump symposium, the best way to understand Trump is as an aspiring caudillo, who ""assures voters that he will use authoritarian power for good."" As the editors of National Review acknowledge, Trump's electrifying success is not the product of some mass hypnotic delusion. Rather, it is a direct result of the Republican Party's failures. ""If responsible men irresponsibly ignore an issue as important as immigration,"" they write, ""it will be taken up by the reckless."" And if conservatives fail to offer an agenda for bettering the lives of American workers, the editors warn, ""the legitimate anxieties and discontents of blue-collar voters will be exploited by demagogues."" If conservatives want to defeat Trump, it's not good enough to point out his flaws. There also needs to be a candidate who can swoop in and win over the voters who have thus far been swayed by Trump's message. So, if Trump isn't conservatives' best choice, then who is? Are any of his rivals for the GOP nomination up to the task of crafting a working-class agenda and addressing conservative concerns about immigration? Two candidates, Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, have separated themselves from the rest of the field in this regard. Though both Cruz and Rubio have sterling conservative credentials, Cruz has done much to win the support of conservatives for whom ideological orthodoxy is a high priority, while Rubio has sought to appeal to conservatives of a more pragmatic bent. How are these strategies working out? Consider the travails of Rubio, the GOP candidate who on the surface appears to be Trump's most formidable rival. Steeped in the rhetoric of movement conservatism from a young age, Rubio is as sunny and forward-looking as Trump is dark and nostalgic. He has championed entrepreneurial capitalism, yet he has also called for modernizing the safety net to ensure that families of modest means are protected from the vicissitudes of a changing economy. Though Rubio is not the only GOP candidate to have addressed the challenges facing working- and middle-class families, he is by far the best at discussing these issues in a compelling, cogent way. Instead of seeing globalization purely as a threat, Rubio welcomes it as an opportunity. To capitalize on this opportunity, he backs a sweeping overhaul of higher education designed to make it easier for workers to upgrade their skills. None of this has been enough to win over conservative voters. For all Rubio's virtues, his fumbling attempts to allay conservatives' fears about his immigration record have badly damaged his prospects. Essentially, Rubio's willingness to work with Senate Democrats on the Gang of Eight immigration bill has convinced many conservatives that he is either an open-borders ideologue or simply too naive to be trusted with the presidency. There is still time for Rubio to address these concerns. But time is running short. Cruz has fared better in recent weeks, and he appears to have a fighting chance of defeating Trump in the Iowa caucus. Having recognized the potency of anti-immigration sentiment among GOP primary voters, he has adopted the most detailed and aggressive strategy for strengthening immigration enforcement and limiting future less-skilled immigration. Yet it's not clear that Cruz's hard-edged persona will wear well over time, whether in a general election or in GOP primaries in big, winner-take-all coastal and Midwestern states that may well play the role of kingmaker. If Rubio needs to seem shrewder and sharper than he has in the past, Cruz needs to seem less nakedly ambitious and more humane. To create the perfect Trump-killer, one would ideally merge the two Cuban American senators into a single Voltron-like Republican presidential candidate, who would combine Cruz's prosecutorial intensity and hard-line immigration stance with Rubio's reformist impulses and his optimistic and inclusive tone. Short of such an unholy amalgamation, anti-Trump conservatives are going to have many sleepless nights over the coming weeks.

Bernie Sanders if he supported reparations for black Americans. His answer was ""No."" ""Its likelihood of getting through Congress is nil,"" he said. ""Second of all, I think it would be very divisive."" Writing for the Atlantic, Ta-Nehisi Coates critiqued Sanders' response for betraying a selective radicalism. ""Sanders is a lot of things, many of them good. But he is not the candidate of moderation and unification, so much as the candidate of partisanship and radicalism,"" writes Coates. ""Unfortunately, Sanders's radicalism has failed in the ancient fight against white supremacy."" In turn, this sparked a litany of reactions and critiques, all focused on the politics of reparations. The strongest response, from Daniel Denvir at Salon, sidesteps the question of Congress to focus on the claim that reparations ""would be very divisive."" For Denvir, this is key: ""Sanders might not be a moderate but he is keenly interested in unifying voters,"" he writes. Contrary to Coates' analysis, Sanders is a uniter, with a plan to unify the public around an expansive agenda of economic radicalism. And while reparations might make sense, pursuing them could irreparably damage the Sanders-led ""political revolution"" that requires support from white Americans who reject reparations. Put differently, Sanders is a radical politician, and as such, he's keenly aware of the contours of his coalition. As demonstrated by his rise in the Democratic primary, he might be able to win the nomination--and the primary--on a platform of anti-plutocratic action. Reparations, which force a brutal and substantive reckoning with America's racist past and present, would shatter that. Which is to say that Sanders' quip about Congress--which, in its present form, wouldn't pass single-payer or free college either--is a smokescreen for a shrewd (and correct) political argument. But how does the political argument fare? Reparations are unpopular because they run into the strongest headwind in American politics: White opposition to programs that target on the basis of race. That includes everything from affirmative action and welfare (pre- and post-reform) to a program like the Affordable Care Act, which some perceived as a racial entitlement that took from the healthy and insured (largely white and middle-class) and distributed to the less healthy and uninsured (disproportionately black and Latino). At least one prominent critic even attacked the plan as a kind of ""reparations."" Overall, white attitudes toward blacks are tightly tied to their attitudes toward the welfare state. The Sanders theory is that you can overcome this with programs that reject targeting in favor of broad and universal benefits. Under single-payer health insurance, everyone has the same access to the health system. Under free college, everyone has access to the same public institutions. If everyone pays in and everyone collects, then there's no basis for resentment. You can circumvent race, full stop. But is this true? Let's go back to white attitudes about government spending. As sociologist Martin Gilens explains in a chapter for the 1998 volume Perception and Prejudice: Race and Politics in the United States, white beliefs about government vary by program. Head Start and job training are popular among whites; welfare and food stamps are not. Even as, in each case, whites see blacks and other minorities as the main beneficiaries by a significant margin. The difference is that the former challenge a belief that blacks ""lack commitment to the work ethic."" Generalized racial resentment plays an important role, but it's the perception of blacks as ""lazy"" that acts as the strongest predictor of whites' welfare views. And the perception is widespread. Forty percent of white Americans say whites are more hardworking than blacks--according to data from the General Social Survey--and 45 percent say ""blacks don't have the motivation or willpower to pull themselves out of poverty."" Which is why, as Gilens writes in his 2009 book Why Americans Hate Welfare, ""Programs that are seen as enhancing the ability of poor people to support themselves ... do not evoke the same negative racial imagery."" By contrast, those perceived as undermining the work eithic or unfairly rewarding the unqualified evoke negative attitudes toward blacks, which increases opposition toward the programs themselves. (On the other side, the white public often backs race-targeted programs designed to ""help minorities help themselves."") The Sanders revolution is multiracial and multicultural, but--like any political victory in present-day America--it depends on white Americans. It's why he can't support reparations. They're too alienating to the white voters he needs to transform the nation's politics. But this, potentially, is also true of his largest programs, like single-payer. Yes, they're universal, but as backers argued in response to Coates' critique, they're also anti-poverty measures that give major benefits without comparable contributions. In the same way that the Affordable Care Act inspired tremendous, racialized opposition, a single-payer health plan--if seen as a handout and not a ""hand up""--might do the same and fracture Sanders' coalition along racial lines. The revolution might crash on the shores of its realization. This isn't a judgment on Sanders, his campaign, or his theory of change. But it's important to see that the forces that make reparations impossible can also, in diminished but powerful form, curtail his agenda too. Which gets to a larger observation. When Sanders heaps praise on the social democracies of Europe, he neglects the degree to which they rest on racial and cultural homogeneity. Danes are happy to help Danes; Swedes are happy to help Swedes. But that's true here as well. The New Deal came with racist exclusion, and it took national effort in a global war to build the solidarity needed to expand Social Security and other programs beyond white workers. Unions, as well, struggled with America's racial hierarchy, where the spoils of national wealth weren't supposed to go to blacks and other minorities. The rights revolution of the 1960s ended the implicit contract between white Americans and the national government. Now, benefits were open to everyone. But our politics couldn't accomodate this change. The New Deal consensus shattered, with most white Americans backing the party that rejects the activist state, and minorities backing the one that does. In a real way, the past 50 years have been a novel experiment in multiracial welfare democracy, and we're still struggling to see if it's possible, now against a vocal politics of revanchist ethno-nationalism, embodied by Donald Trump. (With the rise of mass immigration, something similar and more dramatic is also happening in Europe.) Sanders isn't just running against Wall Street or the political establishment; he's running--along with American liberalism--against those forces that reject the multiracial welfare democracy as a project. And the truth is that he can win the presidency and still lose that fight. Read more of Slate's coverage of the Democratic primary."	Why Bernie Sanders' Political Revolution Depends on White America

Specifically with this business about how Hillary Clinton is nearly tied with Sen. Bernie Sanders in Iowa and trailing him by as many as 27 percentage points in New Hampshire. One imagines the popular former president fantasizing about going nuclear on Sanders and all that he and his band of feel-good millennials stand for. But we're not there yet. ""I want to begin by saying that I know there's a hard fight here,"" Clinton said at the beginning of his rally in Concord, New Hampshire on Wednesday, his third visit to the state since he recently began campaigning, ""and I know we're running against one of your neighbors."" (Lowering expectations by noting that Sanders represents Vermont, and that's probably the only reason why Hillary could/will lose here? Check.) Clinton then began to outline ""what I think is goin' on."" A Bill Clinton explanation of what's goin' on is rarely a terse affair. The condensed version is a 30-minute variety show relaying macroeconomic trends, old stories about New Hampshire voters, data about the effects of certain chemicals on the brain, walkthroughs of the financial collapse, considerations of how to win the hearts and minds of Muslims to whom radicalization represents an appealing option, wage gains and losses over the past 30 years, folksy jokes, and so on. The message Clinton is trying to sell on behalf of his wife is one that's lately out of fashion: that the country needs a pragmatic progressive, ready to serve as president on day one, to build on the foundation of meaningful gains that President Obama has laid in place over the past seven years. Democrats do not, by contrast, need to return to the beginning and start out on a more leftist trajectory, because that's never going to happen, and the opportunity costs of trying are too high. ""We don't need more gridlock in Washington,"" he said during his presentation. ""We can't afford to waste a year or two."" He was speaking specifically about wasting a year or two on the relitigation of health care reform. The Clinton camp has cleaned up its act against Sanders' single-payer health care proposal following a ham-fisted deployment last week. The Republicanesque talking points about how Sanders is a loon who wants to tax you up the wazoo and take away your health care have been replaced with a more traditional center-left argument about how pushing for single-payer would be a waste of time. Clinton said explicitly that he didn't ""want to comment on the merits"" of such a plan, just on the ""practical reality"" at hand. ""It's a lot easier to go from 90 [percent insured Americans] to 100 and control costs with executive action,"" he said, ""than it is to go from 0 to 100 with a bill that has to be passed with 60 votes in a Republican Senate to break the filibuster, when we had not a vote to spare to pass Obamacare in a Democratic Senate."" He had a few other sly digs for Sanders along the way. While discussing financial reform, he noted that ""our friends in Canada, which we've heard a lot about in these debates, you know how great they are ... Canada never separated their investment banks and their commercial banks,"" but was able to withstand total financial collapse with more stringent rules against speculation. Sanders has been criticizing Hillary Clinton for not demanding a restoration of the New Deal-era Glass-Steagall law--repealed under President Clinton--that separated investment and commercial banking. Clinton also made sure to point out that ""Hillary does not consider Planned Parenthood a member of the establishment,"" in response to a questionably worded comment from Sanders on Tuesday. Clinton closed with an analysis of the final moment of Sunday's Democratic debate. Hillary Clinton had brought up the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, noting that she ""sent my top campaign aide down there to talk to the mayor of Flint to see what I could do to help."" Sanders' first reaction, though, was to call on Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder to resign. ""What she always thinks about first,"" Bill Clinton said, ""is what do I have to do to make a difference?"" Bill Clinton is an able salesman, but he's trying to sell the idea that Democrats need an experienced figure to push through measured reforms, during a cycle when so many voters on both sides think--rightly or wrongly--that the political system is corrupt and it's time to burn it all down. The Clinton campaign and its top surrogates haven't begun overtly dismissing Sanders' theory of political change as a children's fantasy yet. But the itch is there.

20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/ted_cruz_isn_t_moderating_his_conservative_message_in_new_hampshire.html	"MANCHESTER, New Hampshire--Sen. Ted Cruz, in prime position to serve as the Republican Party's most conservative presidential nominee since Sen. Barry Goldwater in 1964, makes precisely one pander to the supposedly more moderate Republican primary voters of New Hampshire. You know it's a pander because he openly tells the crowd it's a pander. ""How 'bout those Patriots?"" he opened on Sunday evening at the Pasta Loft, a restaurant abutting the postcard-perfect central green of Milford, to roaring approval following the team's Saturday playoff win. ""And by the way, for the record: Tom Brady was framed."" ""I'm not willing to pander on much,"" he joked. ""But on that? Tom Brady was framed, and I have it on good authority that Hillary Clinton was responsible."" This was neither the first nor the last time that Cruz would use this joke. From there, Cruz jumped into roughly the same stump speech that he gives everywhere, whether it's Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, or Mars. It is a comprehensive wish list of conservative activists' ideological goals, structured into two tiers: items he will execute on ""day one,"" and those he will achieve ""in the days that follow."" On the first day of his triumphant administration, Cruz would ""rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action"" taken by his Oval Office predecessor, ""instruct the U.S. Department of Justice to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood and these horrible videos,"" ""instruct the Department of Justice, and the IRS, and every other federal agency, that the persecution of religious liberties ends today,"" ""rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal,"" and ""begin the process of moving the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, the once and eternal capital."" ""In the days that follow,"" he would repeal Obamacare in its entirety, instruct the Department of Education to end Common Core before eliminating itself, defund sanctuary cities, build a border wall, obliterate the ""alphabet soup"" of regulatory agencies, torch the tax code and replace it with a flat tax through which returns can be filed on a postcard, and ... well, if it's something that's been muttered by one attendee to another at a conservative conference at any point in the last 50 years, Cruz intends to enact it. Nowhere, in either his prepared stump speech to New Hampshire voters or his responses to their questions, do you hear a single concession to New England-style moderate Republicanism--to the extent that it still exists. Insofar as winning the nomination goes, this is both necessary and strategic. You can't really get away with regional pandering anymore in this national media environment. Were Cruz, or any other candidate, to whisper one thing in the ears of New Hampshire voters and another to South Carolina voters, there would be an approximately 10-second gap between his delivery and a comprehensive media, activist, and operative assault on his chief selling point: airtight conservative trustworthiness. Fortunately, not bothering to develop a tailored message for Northern moderates is something that the unique size and makeup of this primary field allows him to get away with. Nearly all New Hampshire polling in recent weeks has shown the same static picture: Trump is out front with roughly 30 percent of the vote, followed by a five-way tie for second between Sen. Marco Rubio, Gov. John Kasich, Gov. Chris Christie, Cruz, and Jeb Bush. If you only listened to Cruz, you would not know that Kasich, Christie, and Bush are even running for president, so rarely does he ever mention their names. The only use he has for them in New Hampshire--and it's an important one--is to split the moderate vote among themselves, thereby allowing Cruz to land a first- or second-place finish. To consolidate the conservative vote in New Hampshire--and elsewhere--Cruz needs to draw support from the pools of potential votes he shares with Trump and Rubio. Trump's base of support is usually described alternately as ""white working-class"" or ""sub-college educated,"" but the real prevailing ideological belief among Trump supporters is a belief in Trump himself. That includes many conservatives that Cruz is suddenly, and aggressively, trying to poach. Rubio straddles the party's conservative-moderate divide, a position that's won him so many fans among assorted Republican operatives, pundits, and other poobahs with an eye on the general election. But Rubio's crossover appeal to conservatives and moderates so far has translated into few first-choice commitments from either conservative or moderate voters. Cruz wants Rubio's conservative votes, and he'll try to get them by pointing out the plays Rubio has made for moderate votes. Cruz is confident that comparisons of his record to either Trump's or Rubio's will draw conservative votes his way. In Milford, one woman asked Cruz how she should convince ""a family member who supports Donald Trump"" to stop doing so. ""Let me give you a very simple question that I would suggest you pose to them,"" Cruz, licking his chops, began. ""Have you ever been burned by a politician? Have you ever seen a politician who says one thing and does another? And every one of us has seen that, we've seen that over and over and over again. It's why we're frustrated out of our minds."" ""In a Republican primary,"" he continued, ""everyone says they're a conservative. You notice nobody on that debate stage stands up and says, 'I'm a squishy establishment moderate, I stand for nothing.' Nobody says that. Every one of them claims to be a conservative."" ""Scripture says, 'you shall know them by their fruits,' "" he advised. ""Don't listen to what they say or what I say--ignore what all of us say on the campaign trail. Look to our actions."" As examples, he mentions the ""major drag-out, knockdown battle"" on Obamacare in 2013--aka the Cruz-led procedural battle to defund the Affordable Care Act that prompted a government shutdown--and how none of the other candidates were ""anywhere to be found."" And then, of course, there's immigration. ""There are candidates today who say they care deeply about immigration, they care deeply about amnesty,"" Cruz said. ""Well how do you test that? Also in 2013, we had a knockdown, drag-out fight. Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer and the Democrats joined with a bunch of establishment Republicans in pushing a massive amnesty plan."" According to Cruz--and he's basically right--""the only reason it was beaten is because millions of Americans rose up"" and joined Cruz and fellow legislators to ""defeat it and stop amnesty."" That's obviously a shot at Rubio, but now it's a shot at Trump, too. On Monday night in Whitefield, Cruz extended the ""where were you?"" criticism on the Great 2013 Amnesty Fight to Trump. He also criticized the mogul, without prompt, for supporting the 2008 bank bailout, the 2009 stimulus act, the process of eminent domain, and more. Cruz's pitch to New Hampshire conservatives is straightforward and, from what I'm seeing, effective. I spoke with several voters at Cruz's bus tour stops across the state on Sunday and Monday who came in undecided and left as Cruz supporters. William Davis of Laconia had been considering an array of candidates from Cruz to Bush (""I had a friend of mine in South Carolina who was mad at me for seeing him"") to Carly Fiorina (""I'll go with the conspiracy theory: I literally think there's a media witch hunt to keep her out of the front-runners""). After hearing Cruz's presentation at the Tilt'n Diner in Tilton on Monday, Davies was persuaded. ""He articulated his positions extremely well, he didn't shy away from any of the key issues, and you know what? He didn't shy away from his faith,"" Davies said. ""And the reality is it's going to take that kind of substance to get things changed in this nation."" Sharyn Tabor, also of Laconia, said she last saw Cruz in October and had a ""pretty darn"" positive impression of him, but the Tilt'n Diner appearance--in which Cruz gave a moving testimony of how his father was born again as a Christian--""absolutely"" sealed the deal. ""I think he's the first man that I've seen running for president in I can't remember how long that I would absolutely be honored to vote for."" If Cruz can hold off Trump in Iowa and then consolidate conservatives in New Hampshire to either a first- or second-place finish, he'll be in phenomenal shape to win the nomination. It would be the first time in decades that the more moderate Republican establishment has lost to an uncompromising conservative, a figure who didn't have one eye on the primary and the other on the general election the whole time. The obvious downside to this strategy, and the reason why the nefarious establishment is so reasonably worried, is that never bothering to appeal to moderates means that you never appeal to moderates. During the question-and-answer portion of Cruz's presentation at a remote lodge in Washington, New Hampshire, on Monday, one woman, a working mother with four young children, asked Cruz if he had a paid family-leave plan. Cruz does not. Rubio is one of the few Republican candidates--if not the only one--with a paid-leave proposal. On the Democratic side, both Sen. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have proposals that would offer new parents paid leave at two-thirds of earnings for 12 weeks. Rubio offers a tax credit for businesses that offer paid leave but does not mandate it. ""There's no doubt that all of us would like to see everyone have paid family leave,"" Cruz responded. ""That would be a good thing."" And then he got around to telling her no. ""Politicians love to campaign on giving away free stuff. ... But the simplest rule of economics is TANSTAAFL: 'There ain't no such thing as a free lunch.' That anything a politician gives you, they must first take from you."" He explained, vaguely, that the best way to help parents like her would be to boost economic growth to give workers more leverage in the job market. This was the ""proper"" conservative answer, and it was not a pander. One woman, Paula, came into the event undecided but left a Cruz voter specifically because of that exchange. ""I thought he answered the questions very honestly, especially when the woman asked the question about paid leave. I think it was very honestly answered."" It wasn't a pander? ""Exactly."" But the woman who asked the question, Sarah Sadowski, a registered independent who liked Rubio's paid-leave proposal, was turned off. ""I really feel like 'eventually we'll get there' isn't satisfying. ...If it all hinges on economic prosperity and growth, and we're slowing down, when do I get to stay home with my baby?"" These are the sorts of votes the Republican candidate will need to win the presidential election. Ted Cruz does not have Sarah Sadowski's vote."	Can Ted Cruz Win New Hampshire Without Pandering? 
21	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/hillary_clinton_bests_bernie_sanders_in_democratic_debate_in_charleston.html	"Hillary Clinton's superb debate performance on Sunday raised an unsettling question: If she can be this consistently good on a debate stage, why can't she replicate that impressiveness on the campaign trail or in interviews? Clinton was once again in superior form Sunday night in South Carolina, besting Sen. Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley in the last Democratic debate before the Iowa caucus. Clinton's debating performance is formidable because it combines her intelligence with a sincerity and level of conviction that often seem absent in other forums. When she opened the debate speaking of Martin Luther King Jr.'s role fighting for increased wages, she used his career as a subtle metaphor for what she is pitching: principled leadership with a strong practical bent. That mixture, along with her strength in close-quarter combat and an ability to wrap herself in President Obama's record--something that played well to the Charleston crowd in the auditorium--was what won her this debate. Clinton had several strong moments Sunday night. ""Ninety people a day die from gun violence in this country,"" she noted, before going on to attack Sanders' record on the Second Amendment, methodically reciting a series of his congressional votes. For some reason Sanders still struggles when pressed on his gun rights votes; he called Clinton ""disingenuous"" and said that guns ""should not be a political issue."" Sanders has run an impressive race and is challenging Clinton in both Iowa and New Hampshire, but Clinton's ability to bring him to earth and seem like just another politician--his weird, Trump-like quoting of polls tonight didn't help--is remarkable. (The moderators helped her tonight by making it appear as if Sanders had changed or updated a number of his positions.) The same dynamic occurred when the subject turned to health care. Clinton's attack on Sanders' support for a single-payer system is, er, ""disingenuous"" (as Jim Newell pointed out in Slate last week). But the way she attacked Sanders on the issue tonight was effective: She essentially claimed that Sanders' plan would cause a huge amount of disruption in Obamacare, and thus reopen the battle that has barely ended over the president's signature program. Sanders needs to figure out a way to answer this criticism, but he certainly didn't do so tonight. Clinton's answers on race and the heroin epidemic--about the former she used the phrase ""systemic racism,"" and also spoke passionately about the latter--were equally impressive. Even on the issue of banking and regulatory reform, Clinton got the best of the exchange by turning it into a debate on President Obama. Her attack on Sanders for voting for Bill Clinton's bill on derivatives, meanwhile, was pretty shameless; Sanders, predictably, didn't mention it was a Clinton bill and didn't really respond to her attack. This should be an issue where Sanders dominates the debate, and his trouble doing so was indicative of his larger struggles this evening. (As for Martin O'Malley, he probably had his best debate--such as it was--although he also had the most absurd moment of the night when he claimed he was running because ""black lives matter."") Even so, there was no knockout moment for Clinton: Most of Sanders' supporters, like Trump's, are probably not too caught up in his debate performances, and are instead rightly focused--here they differ from Trump's fans--on his policy platform. But despite all the headlines about Clinton's recent struggles, she is still overwhelmingly likely to be the Democratic nominee. She doesn't need to knock Sanders out. On Sunday morning, the New York Times ran a story about Clinton's campaign, and it was a familiar one: The campaign wasn't going as she had hoped; she had underestimated her opponent (no, not Martin O'Malley); and she has now found herself in a race that is closer than she ever expected. But the biggest mistake her campaign made, arguably, was going along with the Democratic National Committee's debate schedule. That schedule included debates that often take place on weekends (three-day weekends, even!). Not surprisingly, they have been getting much lower viewership numbers than the Republican debates. (Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the hapless DNC chair, laughably claimed that the DNC's goal was to make sure lots of people see them.) But the larger point is that the Clinton team's hesitancy--or anxiety--about the debates shows just how misguided it has been. By ""playing it safe,"" they not only allowed a huge opening for Sanders, but also eschewed the opportunity to exhibit the candidate in the one forum were she doesn't seem like a politician who plays it safe. The best hope for the Clinton campaign is that she wins at least one of the first two states, and then trounces Sanders in South Carolina, effectively wrapping up the nomination and preparing to face Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz or Trump. Unfortunately, she'll have to wait until after the summer to debate one of them."	Hillary Clinton Won Again
22	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/twitter_reacts_to_hillary_and_bernie_s_debate_showdown.html	On Sunday, the Democrats will hold their final debate before the Iowa caucuses. Despite the Democratic National Committee's intentional dearth of debates, and despite the fact that said debates are mainly occurring on low-visibility weekends (and some even lower-visibility holiday weekends), and despite her enormous built-in advantages, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton once again finds herself in a competitive race with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The 74-year-old socialist Larry David lookalike trails Clinton by just 2 points in the gold standard Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa, released this past week. Coupled with recent polls showing him with a lead in the subsequent New Hampshire primary, Sanders has a real chance to disrupt the entire Democratic race. The unexpected closeness of the early contests raises the stakes for Sunday's matchup in Charleston, South Carolina. Partisans on both sides will be carefully watching every moment for weaknesses from either candidate. Watching along with them is fun!

23	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/halting_immigration_won_t_stop_the_u_s_from_becoming_a_majority_minority.html	"As you might have heard, Ann Coulter, the anti-immigration firebrand and devoted Donald Trump enthusiast, was not exactly delighted by South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley's response to President Obama's State of the Union address. Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants, tried to strike a balanced tone on immigration, acknowledging security-related concerns while praising hard-working migrants who enter the country lawfully. In a series of tweets, Coulter offered a tart critique of Haley's remarks, starting off by writing that ""[Donald] Trump should deport Nikki Haley."" Coulter is a skilled provocateur, and her barbed tweet predictably prompted an avalanche of outraged replies. One obvious rejoinder is that Haley can't be deported, as she was born on U.S. soil. That is, Haley is a native-born citizen, and so regardless of what you think about the wisdom of allowing her parents to settle in the United States some decades ago, the governor of South Carolina is staying put. But Coulter's thought experiment is interesting all the same, because it demonstrates that people who fear the browning of America have already lost. The demographic transformation of the United States into a more diverse society is at this point inevitable. The real long-term effect of immigration takes shape as immigrants have children and then as their native-born children have children of their own. If you can't deport Nikki Haley, you'll have to learn to live with the fact that her descendants will live alongside yours. There is a widespread perception that advocates of reducing immigration, and of reducing less-skilled immigration in particular, are at least partly motivated by racism. And of course there are plenty of people who believe that racism is doing all of the work of driving anti-immigration sentiment. If you believe (as I do) that there are perfectly sensible reasons to be skeptical about mass immigration--perhaps you're concerned about the ability of less-skilled immigrants to lead dignified lives without a great deal of taxpayer-funded public assistance--this assumption can be frustrating. In ""The Hidden Immigration Consensus,"" political scientists Jens Hainmueller and Daniel Hopkins surveyed Americans on their attitudes toward different kinds of immigrants, and they found a broad consensus. Whether respondents scored high or low on an index of ethnocentrism (i.e., racial prejudice), they had a strong preference for admitting educated, English-speaking immigrants in high-status occupations. Hainmueller and Hopkins found many respondents who were free of racial prejudice yet who nevertheless believed that it made sense for the U.S. to strongly favor immigrants who were capable of providing for themselves and their families. I'd put myself in this category. Nevertheless, it is hard to deny that at least some anti-immigration sentiment is motivated by racism. So consider this a public service announcement to the racists of America: There's a really good chance that halting immigration will not accomplish what you want it to accomplish. I know this might blow some racist minds, so allow me to explain. Among Americans under the age of 18, non-Hispanic whites will be in the minority by 2020, according to a recent report from the U.S. Census. What this means is that as older, whiter generations climb the stairway to heaven, they will be replaced by younger, less-white generations that will become the crotchety old people of the future. By the time 2040 rolls around, there is a decent chance that the elderly gentleman demanding that you get off his lawn will be nonwhite. (Truthfully, there's a pretty good chance that this elderly gentleman will be me and that by 2040, I mean next week.) This generational replacement will take place regardless of what happens to future immigration levels. As of 2012, the median age of non-Hispanic whites was 42 while that of Hispanics was just 27. The median ages for blacks and Asians were somewhere in between, at 32 and 35 respectively. What this means is that a higher proportion of Hispanics, and to a lesser extent blacks and Asians, are of childbearing age as compared to non-Hispanic whites. Halting all immigration would certainly delay the majority-minority crossover--the moment when non-Hispanic whites will no longer be in the majority of all Americans--but it won't prevent it from taking place. There are some subtleties that these Census projections miss, and this is where things get interesting. There has been a sharp increase in the number of U.S. children of mixed parentage. Indeed, Nikki Haley's children are half-white, and they have plenty of company. Between 1970 and 2013, the share of multiracial babies went from 1 percent to 10 percent, the Pew Research Center estimates. How will these children self-identify as adults? The boundaries of whiteness have proven at least somewhat permeable over the course of U.S. history, and it's become commonplace to assume that the descendants of at least some Hispanic and Asian immigrants will see themselves, and be seen by others, as white. Yet it is also possible that the descendants of Hispanic and Asian immigrants, not to mention black immigrants, will find themselves marginalized and ""racialized."" Brian Duncan, an economist at the University of Colorado, Denver, and Stephen Trejo, an economist at the University of Texas at Austin, have done a great deal of work over the years on ""ethnic attrition,"" a phenomenon in which U.S.-born individuals choose not to identify with an ethnic group despite having ancestors who belonged to that group. How does ethnic attrition work in practice? There are many third-generation Americans with at least one Mexican-born grandparent, but Duncan and Trejo find that only 17 percent of them had three or more grandparents born in Mexico. Virtually all third-generation Americans with three or more Mexican-born grandparents identify as Mexican. In contrast, only 58 percent of those with only one Mexican-born grandparent do the same. More striking still, Duncan and Trejo find that among third-generation American children with at least one Mexican-born grandparent, those who do not identify as Mexican American have far lower high-school dropout rates. One of Duncan and Trejo's more striking findings is that among people of Hispanic origin, those who choose not to identify as Hispanic tend to have higher levels of educational attainment than those who do. There are many reasons this might be true, but one possibility is that the Hispanics who marry non-Hispanic whites tend to be more educated than their counterparts. In ""Social Boundaries and Marital Assimilation,"" sociologists Zhenchao Qian of Brown University and Daniel T. Lichter of Cornell University find that native-born Hispanic women with college educations were more than three times as likely to be married to whites as native-born Hispanics with less than high school educations. Assuming these college-educated, native-born Hispanic women are marrying college-educated, non-Hispanic whites, it's quite likely both that their children will be college-educated themselves and that they might find themselves in social networks that are more Anglo than Hispanic. Over time, one can envision a world in which the more educated descendants of Hispanic immigrants increasingly identify as white while the less educated descendants identify as Hispanic. Under these circumstances, ethnicity would become even more closely associated with social class than is the case today. In this world, the ranks of white people would continue to grow as the children of whites and upwardly mobile Hispanics come to identify as white. But I'm not sure if a racist who is concerned about racial purity would be delighted by this outcome. This leads us to the irony of racist opposition to immigration. Qian and Lichter also find that during the 1990s, the rate of intermarriage between both Hispanics and whites and Asians and whites declined quite significantly. Was this a reflection of rising anti-white prejudice among Asians and Hispanics or rising anti-Asian and anti-Hispanic prejudice among whites? According to Qian and Lichter, it was neither--the main driver of this decrease in the intermarriage rate was simply that the Asian and Hispanic populations increased significantly due to immigration. As the size of an ethnic group grows larger, its members have more interactions with co-ethnics. This makes it more likely that they will have a stronger sense of in-group ethnic solidarity and that they will wind up marrying co-ethnics. To put this a bit differently, if it's slightly easier to connect with someone of your own ethnicity (and I'd say that's generally true), the increase in potential marriage partners from your own ethnic group will make it far less likely that you'll look for marriage partners outside of it. What this also means is that restrictive immigration laws, like those passed in the 1920s, can have the opposite effect--that is, it seems likely that they increase intermarriage levels. Qian and Lichter observe that the immigration restrictions of that era ""effectively cut off the influx of potential marital partners with similar ethnic backgrounds, a situation that undoubtedly hastened intermarriage with other white ethnics over successive generations."" This rise in intermarriage broke down what had once been rigid boundaries separating one white ethnic group from another. ""The lessons for today's high rates of immigration seem clear,"" write Qian and Lichter. ""The continuing influx of immigrants, unlike in the past, has replenished the supply of potential partners for native-born Hispanic and Asian American minorities."" And as a result, the researchers suggest that the level of Hispanic and Asian intermarriage with whites might decline. The fact that large-scale immigration tends to reduce intermarriage isn't an argument for or against it. What is clear, however, is that those who are in favor of reducing immigration on racist grounds are making a serious logical error. If immigration levels fell, the likely result would be a surge in intermarriage that would undermine white racial purity, and more diverse social networks might make it easier for nonwhites to climb to society's uppermost echelons. My guess is that most Americans, white or nonwhite, would be just fine with such an outcome. But anti-immigration racists might not. Be careful what you wish for."

24	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/the_gop_is_learning_to_love_donald_trump.html	"Donald Trump had the line of the night at Thursday's Republican presidential debate--the only thing anyone will remember. ""I will gladly accept the mantle of anger,"" he said, rebuking a critique by South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley from her response to the State of the Union. What makes this a great line? Well, to start, it's theatrical in a way that could only come from Donald Trump. The ""mantle of anger"" sounds like an object from a comic book or a movie--something that gives power to the person who wields it. Each of the more mainstream candidates--Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, Govs. John Kasich and Chris Christie, and former Gov. Jeb Bush--are running as men who understand voter anger. ""I understand why Americans are feeling frustrated and scared and angry when we have a president who refuses to acknowledge the threat we face and even worse, who acts as an apologist for radical Islamic terrorism,"" said Cruz in response to a question about national security. But Trump doesn't understand Republican anger. He is angry. ""We have no borders. Our vets are being treated horribly. Illegal immigration is beyond belief. Our country is being run by incompetent people. And yes, I am angry,"" said Trump. To label him angry, he explains, is just to be accurate. ""I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry. And I say that to Nikki. So when Nikki said that, I wasn't offended. She said the truth."" Trump is an angry man, and Republican voters--or at least, 34 percent of them--love it. His competitors know this, and they're trying to mimic it. Cruz promises maximum force against ""radical Islam""; Rubio angrily denounces President Obama for ""undermining the Second Amendment""; and Christie channels his old, raging New Jerseyan persona by slamming his opponents for dodging questions (""You already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it!""). But none of these candidates is as convincing or as compelling as Trump, who commands the stage with firm attacks on America's alleged enemies--foreign and domestic--and can easily parry his own opponents' attacks, as he did in an exchange with Cruz on ""New York values."" Trump hasn't just improved from his previous debates; he's grown beyond expectations. You could argue, fairly, that he's the best politician in the race. Trump has the juice, in other words, and it's hard to see how he loses it. If there is a threat, it's Cruz. The Texas senator had a decent debate; he opened strong, but the deft counter from Trump and an unexpected barrage from Rubio on immigration left him bloodied by the end. Still, next to Trump, his position is most secure. Not only is Cruz best equipped--among elected politicians in the race--to win Iowa and South Carolina, but he's building a strong presence in New Hampshire too. He's still the evangelical choice in the election--the landing ground for former Ben Carson supporters--and he's the only candidate who can best Trump head-to-head. ""In a hypothetical one-on-one race between the two Republicans,"" notes a new poll from NBC News and the Wall Street Journal, ""Cruz tops Trump, 51 percent to 43 percent."" It's tempting to ask what this means for Rubio, but the better question is what this means for the Republican establishment, such that it exists. By now, Trump was supposed to be losing, and one of the ""serious"" candidates--either Rubio, or Bush, or even Christie--was supposed to be on the rise. But here on Earth Prime, the establishment candidates are squabbling among themselves, each spending millions in a desperate bid to vanquish the others and stand against Trump and Cruz. You saw this in the debate, with Rubio stuck in a skirmish with Christie--near the bottom of the national polls--on Common Core and Planned Parenthood. Winners, someone should tell Rubio, fight above their weight, not below it. Which is to say that, for the establishment, this debate changed nothing. The status quo is where it was on Wednesday. Trump is still the front-runner. And judging from his dominance in the debate, he might even expand his lead.  Cruz is still the next most likely choice, and if he loses support, the beneficiary isn't Rubio--it's Trump. It didn't have to be this way--there was a point where mainstream Republican voices could have stopped Trump with money and effort--but now it's too late. Now, instead of brushing Trump aside, Republican elites are learning to love the Donald and accept him as a potential nominee, or at least a candidate they can work with. Put differently, Republicans are beginning to prepare for a world where Donald Trump, celebrity nativist, is their leader. See more of Slate's GOP primary coverage."

Marco Rubio, who had been having another one of his solid debates that wouldn't change anything, decided to light up Sen. Ted Cruz.

27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/donald_trump_has_ted_cruz_s_number.html	"Thursday night may mark the first debate in which Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz go after each other, thank God. As such, it will be the first opportunity to see how the weaponry they've already been testing out against one another performs in a face-to-face setting. There's reason to believe that Trump has the advantage here. Though Cruz might think he's played Trump better than Trump has played him thus far, Trump has been getting the better of his coattail-rider in the past couple of weeks. The latest Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll from ""gold standard"" Iowa pollster J. Ann Selzer showed Trump cutting into Cruz's lead from the previous survey. Selzer's mid-December poll showed Cruz with a 10-point margin over Trump, 31 percent to 21 percent; the one released Wednesday has Cruz at 25 percent to Trump's 22 percent. Several other polls this week have shown Trump with a slight lead in Iowa, giving Trump a modest edge over Cruz in the RealClearPolitics polling average. What effect could the Cruz birther business, injected into the conversation early last week by Trump, have here? Selzer's survey, like the Huffington Post/YouGov findings earlier this week, doesn't see widespread Republican concern about it--yet--but does find enough concern that it might make a difference in a tight race. Fifteen percent of respondents in that poll are ""bothered"" by Cruz's Canadian birth while 32 percent of Trump's supporters are. ""Fifteen percent in Iowa,"" Selzer tells Bloomberg, ""when you have this many candidates, if that's part of what's taking people to Trump, it's not nothing."" Bloomberg's Joshua Green adds that it doesn't help Cruz to have all of his lesser rivals for the same niche of hard-right Iowa support--like Sen. Rand Paul, Mike Huckabee, and Rick Santorum--echoing Trump's questioning. If the birther thing bops Cruz out of the first-place Iowa finish that's come to be expected of him, it will be because of the brilliant way Trump went about business here. Rather than outright saying that Cruz is a shady, maple-tree-hugging Canadian treason baby, and thus risking serious blowback from conservatives, Trump played the just sayin', this is going to be a big problem if the Democrats bring it up in court card. That way, those who might be torn between Cruz and Trump could be persuaded, as unlikely as it seems, to consider Trump the safer political bet. As one likely Iowa caucusgoer told a Weekly Standard reporter: ""I liked Ted Cruz as well. But now there's questions about his citizenship. I don't want to wait and see what's going to happen with that."" Trump's comments, and the subsequent validation from an august figure like Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe, have also sparked something of a debate among legal scholars on the issue. Though the consensus still holds that Cruz is eligible, Cruz can't turn for help to his friends in the Republican leadership, because he has no friends in the Republican leadership. The birther attacks have been concerning enough to stir Cruz from his no-tackle policy against Trump. Speaking on the Howie Carr radio show Tuesday, Cruz said that ""Donald comes from New York and he embodies New York values."" Trump's response, when asked about which dastardly New York values he embodies, was perfect. ""One thing it means is energy. You know, when the World Trade Center got hit, we rebuilt that World Trade Center and we got through and very few places in this world could have gotten through what we went through,"" he said Wednesday. ""I mean, I was so proud of New York, the World Trade Center, these two massive, 110-story buildings come down, thousands of people killed. I've never seen anything like it in my life. And immediately the rebuilding started."" Again, Trump didn't respond in the negative personal way that he's roped Cruz into doing. He simply pointed out that Cruz is saying these things because ""he's very nervous. He's, ya know, very frightened by what's happening I guess."" This explanation has the added political benefit of being true. There's more for Trump to work with. The New York Times published a story Wednesday night about how Cruz, despite saying that he and his wife funded his 2012 Senate campaign by scraping together their personal savings, also took out and didn't properly disclose two low-interest loans from Goldman Sachs and Citibank. The story itself isn't a Cruz death sentence, but it does offer rivals an on ramp into piercing Cruz's image as some sort of outsider, hayseed, simple country lawyer taking on fancy, big city interests left and right. Cruz is a Princeton- and Harvard-trained corporate lawyer whose wife is on leave as a Goldman executive, and whose well-funded presidential campaign has drawn fantastic sums of lucre from members of the New York financial industry. As I wrote in December, Trump is the candidate best positioned to launch these criticisms against Cruz as another bought-and-paid-for stooge of special interests, since Trump's strongest cross-ideological appeal is that he (theoretically) can't be bought. We're seeing evidence that Trump is getting under the usually unflappable Cruz's skin. Surveying the graveyard of fallen rivals who've tried and failed to combat Trump thus far, it's clear that doesn't end well. Read more of Slate's coverage of the GOP primary."	Why Donald Trump Is Perfectly Poised to Win a Debate Fight With Ted Cruz
28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/nikki_haley_s_state_of_the_union_rebuttal_was_anti_black_lives_matter.html	"On Tuesday, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley lived up to the hype. Tasked with giving the Republican Party's response to President Obama's final State of the Union address, Haley excelled, besting predecessors in a difficult format. Besides her skill and comfort in giving a televised address, the secret to her success isn't hard to parse. Instead of rebutting Obama, she aimed her fire--and by extension, the Republican Party's--at its chief threat: Donald Trump. ""My story is really not much different from millions of other Americans. Immigrants have been coming to our shores for generations to live the dream that is America,"" said Haley, introducing herself to the American public for the first time, before going on the offensive against the Republican presidential front-runner. ""Today, we live in a time of threats like few others in recent memory. During anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation."" Most coverage--and most praise--of Haley's address focused on this passage and others that signaled a clear attack on Trump from the Republican establishment. ""No one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country,"" she said. But missing in the analysis was a detailed look at the next part of her speech, where she contrasted Trump and anti-immigration voices on the right with protest movements on the left. After voicing conservative Republican positions on border security, she pivoted to the defining event of her tenure in South Carolina--the racist killings at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston. ""What happened after the tragedy is worth pausing to think about,"" she said. ""Our state was struck with shock, pain, and fear. But our people would not allow hate to win. We didn't have violence, we had vigils. We didn't have riots, we had hugs."" Haley continued with this: ""We removed a symbol that was being used to divide us, and we found a strength that united us against a domestic terrorist and the hate that filled him."" On the surface, this is a simple retelling of the story of last summer, where--after protests and pressure from community activists--Haley removed the Confederate battle flag from the state capitol building in Columbia (albeit, a retelling that threads the needle about what the Confederate flag actually means). At the same time, you don't have to read closely to see it's also a barely coded rebuke to movements like Black Lives Matter. ""We didn't have riots, we had hugs,"" for example, is a clear reference to the events in Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, Maryland, where police killings of unarmed black men unleashed a torrent of pent-up anger and frustration around police violence and harassment. ""Some people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference,"" she said. ""That is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference."" This sounds pleasant enough. But underneath is something ugly: the idea that, if you face oppression or horrific violence, the only legitimate response is reflexive quiet and forgiveness. Good victims, Haley seems to say, don't make noise. The people who do--they're the real problem. In this formulation, traditional Republican conservatism is a moderating force, that exists between the noise of Trump and of Black Lives Matter. This turn only holds, however, if you equate Trump--an opportunistic demagogue leading a nativist movement--with a movement whose name affirms the value of human life, and whose aim is less violence in the conduct of policing. Equating the two is sophistry. But even if it wasn't--even if Trump and Black Lives Matter were equivalent phenomena on different sides of the spectrum--Haley's formulation only works if you deny that loud, angry people can have legitimate grievances. If rioting Baltimore residents are just petulant, then yes, they should stay quiet. But the people in Baltimore (and in Ferguson, and in any other city with protests over police violence) face deep deprivation. They live in hollowed-out neighborhoods and face deadly crime. They have a right to be angry. Indeed, anger--when harnessed and focused--can help create change. Which gets to why Haley's message will fail to change the present dynamic in the Republican Party. Much of the party's base is angry. Some of this is rooted in unambiguous racism. But some of it reflects problems the party has ignored, from drug addiction and family instability to a broken economy that doesn't deliver to ordinary workers. And if ""be quiet"" is the only answer establishment Republicans have, then they've already lost their war against Trump and his imitators."	The Ugly Message Hidden in Nikki Haley's State of the Union Response
29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/01/anti_terrorist_laws_should_not_have_been_applied_against_dwight_and_steven.html	"The standoff in Oregon is a modern Western that could end in a Greek tragedy. There are no angels in this story. There are old fools and younger hotheads, single-minded prosecutors worried that judges might get the silly notion that they have the discretion to judge, and unbending federal bureaucrats seemingly intent on teaching others a lesson. Enter a posse of self-proclaimed militiamen, fueled by antigovernment sentiment, who say they occupied a national wildlife refuge to protect persecuted ranchers. The protesters, in turn, attract those who see such drama as an opportunity to air their own grievances or advance their own agendas--it's about government tyranny; no, it's about gun control; no, the issue is racism. The confrontation attracts the media, and the inevitable chorus of talking heads follows, including one advising the government to call out the troops--when did we abandon law enforcement and declare martial law? There may be a moral in here somewhere, but competing narratives may drown out any chance of finding it. Lost amid this bizarre behavior is the fact that the episode was sparked by the prosecution of a pair of ranchers on arson charges. Dwight and Steven Hammond, father and son, were charged under a law enacted to fight terrorism, not rein in wayward ranchers. When the Hammonds started unauthorized fires to protect their property against invasive species and an approaching wildfire, they were charged with crimes laid out in the ominous-sounding 1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. This legislation was passed by Congress in the wake of the 1993 terrorist bombing of the World Trade Center and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing--at the time the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil. Congress amended the criminal code to put more bullets in the bandoliers of federal prosecutors, enabling them to crack down on the illegal manufacture, traffic, and use of explosives and fire to cause casualties and damage property. Arson was not the main point, but incendiary attacks were included. There is no doubt that the Hammonds are guilty of deliberately starting fires to protect their own interests and burned 150 acres of federal land. A jury of their peers decided they were guilty, and the defendants accepted the verdict. While the jury deliberated on additional charges, the Hammonds reached a deal with the prosecutor. They would not appeal their verdict and in return the prosecutor would allow them to stay out on bail until sentencing and allow them to serve the sentences concurrently. The point of contention between the prosecutor and the trial judge was over the increased penalties mandated by the legislation--five years was the minimum sentence. The judge said that the legislators clearly did not have the Hammonds in mind when they passed the anti-terrorist law. Five years in prison for burning 150 acres--which the Bureau of Land Management has said improved the land for grazing--was so ""grossly disproportionate,"" the judge said, that it violated the defendants' Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment. He sentenced the father, Dwight Hammond, to three months in jail and his son, Steven, to a year behind bars. It could have ended there, but the prosecutor appealed the sentence--the trial judge's invoking the Eighth Amendment virtually guaranteed that. No one was arguing that the Hammonds deserved more time in prison, but Department of Justice prosecutors apparently do not want to lose the immense leverage they have obtained over defendants through the federalization of ordinary crimes and the often draconian mandatory sentences that accompany them. These enable prosecutors to pile on charges and intimidate defendants with threats of lifetimes in prison even if only some of the charges stick. Anti-terrorist laws should not be used to strengthen prosecutors' hands in nonterrorist prosecutions--it makes national security needs look like an instrument of oppression--but when Congress writes anti-terrorist laws, it does not restrict them to prosecuting terrorists. Terrorism may be the catalyst, but the resulting laws are crime-fighting tools. They can and will be used by creative prosecutors in cases beyond the original purpose. The Hammonds were not targets of the anti-terrorist legislation. They were collateral damage. Inflated fears of terrorism have propelled this unfortunate legal trend. By invoking anti-terrorist laws, prosecutors can portray ordinary criminals as menaces to the republic. In the Hammond case, the prosecutors won their appeal. The appellate judge ruled that a sentencing mandate is a mandate, not a suggestion. The deal the defendants had struck with the prosecution applied only to the charges, not the sentence. What the Hammonds saw as a double-cross by the prosecution was technically fair and square. As for the penalty being excessive, the appellate judge pointed out that other defendants have received far more severe sentences for lesser crimes, citing the example of one defendant who, under California's three-strikes law, was sentenced to 50 years for stealing nine videotapes and another who got 25 years to life for the theft of three golf clubs. It seems curious to support what may be one injustice by citing even worse injustices. Into the mix comes Ammon Bundy, a veteran of a previous standoff with the federal government, along with his ""Citizens for Constitutional Freedom""--grandstanders looking for another forum from which to fulminate against the feds. Even pretenders sometimes have legitimate causes, and the unconscionable behavior of the government in the Hammond case offered one. While attracting public attention to the Hammond case was a positive, turning it into a media circus and frightening people detracts from the case and ultimately erodes sympathy. The Hammonds have said that they want no confrontations. If the Citizens for Constitutional Freedom is truly concerned about justice, it should go home satisfied that it has made its point. What should the government do if the ""militiamen"" don't quickly disband? Certainly not call out the Army--or federal marshals, the FBI, or the Forest Rangers. Although armed, the protesters hold no hostages. They are in the middle of nowhere. This is more of a sit-in or campout than a standoff. It's certainly not a terrorist action. No one is in immediate danger. In situations like this--involving angry protesters, domestic quarrels, mentally disturbed individuals, even terrorists--the first objective of authorities is to stay cool, reduce tension, and avoid provoking aggressive behavior that could endanger lives. The federal government has a broader objective in ensuring domestic tranquility. America is undeniably divided. Appalling actions by police, irresponsible rhetoric by politicians, anxieties about terrorism, and other concerns have made these tense times. We do not need another domestic tragedy. To deal with dilemmas, playwrights and screenwriters can contrive a plot twist and make it all work out. One dramatic option, which has been suggested, would be for President Obama to commute the sentences of the Hammonds and send Bundy and his men home. It would raise questions of equity but would remedy an injustice and promptly resolve the episode without risk of a violent ending that clearly is not in the interest of the country--or of the president's own sincere commitment to reducing violence on the home front.
