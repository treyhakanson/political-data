As Molly Ball reports in The Atlantic, the great ACORN panic of 2009 resulted in the collapse of the organization and a crop of new Republican legislators who tightened voter registration laws. In the cause of preventing bureaucrats from dealing with a few junk petitions, states have effectively slashed the sort of independent efforts that a young Barack Obama managed in 1992, at Illinois's Project Vote. For example: In 2008, Nevada had 100,000 more registered Democrats than registered Republicans, and the Obama-Biden ticket carried the state by more than 120,000 votes. In 2012, the Democratic advantage is down to 55,000. See Mitt Romney's good news from Day 43. See today's good news for Barack Obama.	Why Today Was a Good Day for Mitt Romney
1	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/09/tea_party_campaigning_americans_for_prosperity_have_a_big_well_funded_operation_but_they_are_still_making_some_basic_mistakes_reaching_voters_.html	"LEESBURG, Va.--The new Americans for Prosperity field office is a short walk from downtown, in an unusually stately office park. (Most things in Leesburg are unusually stately.) Today, National Prosperity Action Day, the red brick office is decorated with yellow balloons and loaded with trays of Famous Dave's pork and brisket. Sixty-odd AFP activists mill inside and outside, getting to know each other before the big schlep. For one day, the Leesburg office is AFP central. Tim Phillips, the Tea Party group's affable president, is here to host a live-stream rev-up-the-troops documentary. He and a two-man crew walk through the office's dozen rooms, and a camera-laptop contraption captures the Tea Partiers as they make calls. Each room has at least eight no-frills Samsung cellphones--""freedom phones,"" cheaper than land lines--bowls of candy, and simple scripts. Phillips gathers the faithful in the parking lot, and boils the script down to a few sentences. ""We have a very simple message to the folks we're reaching,"" he says. ""Do you know what that message is?"" YES! ""It's about the disastrous impact that Barack Obama's policies are having on our families, our businesses, and our nation. And we're going to change it, right?"" YES! Democrats are feeling better about the 2012 election. Every time Mitt Romney stumbles through a news cycle, every time a swing-state poll comes out, Barack Obama is doing better than he has any right to do. A year ago, no electoral mathematician would have predicted Democrats holding on to the Senate. As of right now, Harry Reid's party is actually pulling it off. Enter the Tea Party. Since 2009, the conservative movement has mushroomed with well-funded third-party groups that buy ads and canvass voters, independent of the Republican Party. According to a study of this mojo by Tom Hamburger and Peter Wallsten, AFP will spend around $62 million on Get Out the Vote efforts in swing states, managed by 116 organizers, headquartered in 51 offices. Compare that with Americans Coming Together, the Soros-funded 527 that spent $79 million to complement the Democrats' turnout machines in 2004--then add in FreedomWorks, the Faith and Family Coalition, and all those local Tea Party teams. But it's AFP that makes Democrats clammy and nervous and paranoid. This is David Koch's group, the one that was buying Solyndra TV ads nine months ago, because its money spigot never runs dry. Can it cancel out all the work that the Democratic National Committee's Organizing for America has done all year? I'm spending Saturday with AFP, so maybe I'll find out. Of the 60-odd activists on hand, half have been bussed down from Baltimore County, Md. ""They actually completed 197 survey calls on the bus ride to get here,"" says Phillips. While the Virginia team makes phone calls, the Marylanders gather in the front of the office. Nick Loffer, the grassroots director, hands out 10 Motorola tablets, preloaded with data and maps that will tell them which voters are persuadable. ""You're going to walk up to the household and hit 'arrive,' "" says Loffer. ""You're going to say something like this: 'Hi, my name's Nick. I'm with Americans for Prosperity of Virginia, and I'm concerned about the direction of our country. Do you have time to answer a few survey questions?' If they say yes, you proceed with the questions."" At 12:45 p.m. the Marylanders pile onto the buses. AFP staffers are waiting for them. Each group will consist of three people--the tablet-holder, the buddy, and a spare--and be dropped off at a predetermined spot. My bus makes its first stop, then heads up a hill, then stalls. ""We need more ballast at the front!"" says Nick Loffer.* Eight Tea Partiers move toward the bus driver. The weight balances, and the bus moves on. ""Maybe Mayor Bloomberg is onto something about calorie laws!"" jokes Loffer. I do my part to solve the ballast issue and get off at the next stop, on Royal Street. Gail and Steve Koroupis, two retirees, are the team leaders. Eric Martin, who works in the Baltimore County sheriff's office, is the bonus canvasser. Steve pulls a green AFP T-shirt over his collared shirt. Gail opts for a white AFP T-shirt. Eric sticks with a Hawaiian shirt, shorts, and black socks. He's the only one of us equipped for a few walking hours in Leesburg's Indian summer. Gail fusses with the tablet, spinning it around to figure out which direction we're supposed to go. ""They shouldn't give these things to old people,"" she says, chuckling. We miss our street, but I use my newly outdated iPhone to reorient us, and we double back to find an expansive ranch house occupied by a possible swing voter. Eric knocks on the door, hears nothing, and prepares to leave an AFP door hanger. (""Do you think the private sector is doing fine? President Obama does."") Right then Patrick Henry, our 70-year-old African-American target voter walks out of a different door, scratching his head and asking who we are. ""Hello!"" says Gail. ""We're from Americans for Prosperity."" ""We just have one question,"" says Steve. Gail pecks away at the tablet, trying to log us in. ""You're the first person we've talked to,"" says Steve. ""You're our guinea pig."" Finally, Gail figures out the tablet. ""It says, how would you rate President Obama's job performance?"" she says. ""Strongly approve, approve, undecided, disapprove, strongly disapprove?"" Henry scratches his head. ""I'd have to say, based on the fact that he has no help, he's doing well."" ""That's strongly approve, I think,"" says Gail. ""We're not really here to debate the issues,"" Steve assures Patrick Henry. Gail tries to punch in the answer. ""It's not letting me do that,"" she says. Eric steps up with an ice-breaker. ""We're not really fond of Obama because of his policies,"" he says. ""He's run up our debt $5 trillion since he took office, and it prevents the private sector from growing because it crowds out investment capital."" Gail interrupts him. ""I got it working!"" she says. ""OK,"" says Eric. ""Sometimes I can't help myself!"" The soft-spoken voter explains why he's sticking with Obama. The activists politely try to change his mind. ""You might want to consider, if you're on Medicare, that President Obama is taking $700 billion out of Medicare,"" says Steve. Henry keeps talking, but he never budges. ""Mitt Romney's problems are not my problems,"" he says. ""I'm in the middle class."" ""So are we,"" says Steve. After 15 minutes, the Tea Partiers decide to wrap it up. Everybody shakes hands. Henry clearly was glad for the company, but he didn't help AFP move the needle. We stick with the tablet's map and explore Leesburg. It doesn't get any better. One address is a dentist office, closed for the day. The other is an apartment behind a ""no solicitation sign."" The next is another business that greets customers with a new-looking Obama-Biden sign. ""Who came up with this list?"" sighs Eric. Steve looks across the street from that pro-Obama business and sees another black voter, sitting on a stoop next to a pickup truck loaded with construction gear. ""Do you live here?"" The voter, who doesn't remove his dark sunglasses, says he does. ""OK, you'll do,"" says Steve. Eric and I stand over to the side, and Gail and Steve conduct their interview. ""This is Obama country,"" says Eric, who sounds more bemused than annoyed. ""We're not going to find Romney voters out here."" Gail and Steve are getting one-word answers and recording them dutifully. Obama's job so far? Approve. His choice for president? Obama. His choice for U.S. Senate? Undecided. It's not going great, but it's going--and then the tablet goes blank. ""Out of battery,"" says Gail. It's only been an hour and 10 minutes, and we're done for the day. I ask whether we can find a cellphone store and plug the tablet into a BlackBerry charger. ""I'm not going there,"" says Steve. So the Tea Partiers say a polite goodbye to their last subject. ""Do you have work? Good! You don't meet enough people with steady work."" We head to an intersection where the AFP bus can pick us up. Nobody's particularly satisfied with the day's labors. ""I don't feel like we moved the ball,"" says Steve. We see other green-shirted activists crossing Leesburg's pleasant streets. We miss the bus, Eric calls it, and we finally catch it. The driver wends through Leesburg, picking up three more groups of people. One group, beset by the same low-battery crisis, is killing time by touring a graveyard. ""They're looking for Democrat voters!"" jokes Eric. The Tea Partiers swap stories of voter contact, angry dogs, people who shut the door on the first question, and a couple of people who actually listened. Steve's in a contemplative mood. ""If Obama gets back in,"" he asks me, ""what are the odds, you think, that he's impeached?"" I say it would be tough to convict him of ""high crimes"" or to get a two-thirds vote in the Senate to expel him. ""Well, there's been a number of decisions which required the Congress to be involved, and he went around it."" The bus arrives back at headquarters. AFP staffers have brought in fresh ice to cool their iced tea and lemonade. Virginia volunteers are finishing up with the phones and chatting with each other planning the next visits. The Marylanders are comparing stories, trying to figure out whether they reached enough voters. Shortly after 3:30, they gather in the front room again for a head count. ""We're heading back to the so-called free state of Maryland,"" says Loffer, the grassroots director. ""I hope you enjoyed our low taxes and economic freedom."" The Marylanders head toward their bus. They pose for a group photo. They get back to work, on their phones. And on Sunday, AFP will announce that its volunteers made 400,000 phone calls. Correction, Sept. 25, 2012: This article originally misattributed the quote ""We need more ballast at the front!"" to volunteer Adam Nicholson."

And for good reason: If Obama wins the Buckeye State, he can lose Virginia and Florida and still win the election. If Romney wins Ohio, his path to 270 electoral votes becomes much clearer. (No Republican president has moved into the White House without moving Ohio into the win column.) But as Election Day draws closer, Obama's lead there has remained small but consistent, standing today at about 5 points. It may not seem like much, but that 51 to 46 margin may be the one that matters most. See Monday's good news for Mitt Romney. See Barack Obama's good news from Friday.

Church officials recently embarked on a voter registration drive which, while technically nonpartisan, reminds Mormons to speak ""with one voice"" politically. And with 74 percent of Mormons identifying as Republican-leaning, there's little doubt about what that ""one voice"" will be saying. A successful mobilization of Mormon voters, combined with an ever-rising unemployment rate, could help Nevada swing Romney's way. See Mitt Romney's good news from Day 47, Day 48, Day 49, and Day 50.

""But let's say he disappeared and left a little note that said: 'Who is John Galt?' Hey, where the hell's Steve Jobs? I don't know. It's only Earth. Did he get in a spaceship? Where'd he go? In 2012, we've got men and women going on strike."" Aglialoro is the co-producer of the Atlas Shrugged film trilogy, and he is full of rhetorical questions. It's Sept.18, and we're sitting across a table at the Heritage Foundation shortly before the first-ever screening of Atlas Shrugged II: The Strike. Aglialoro's co-producer, Harmon Kaslow, sits nearby, sporting one of the Atlas pins that sell for $14.95 on the film's website. Washington is still talking about the video of Mitt Romney deriding the ""47 percent"" of voters too dependent on the federal teat to vote Republican. So Aglialoro wants me to think of Atlas Shrugged as a history of the future. ""Most entitlements are promises made by politicians to the unwilling,"" he says. ""We've got generations of people on welfare. That's not because there weren't job opportunities, or education, or anything like that. We've got a problem of greed on the level of the entitlement class. Not the producers and the entrepreneurs that are creating the tax revenue. They're the 53 percent. If we get to the tipping point, 57, 58 percent, then you're going to see people saying: How do I go on strike?"" In the novel, and in these films, the ""strike"" is the literal disappearance of industrialists and inventors. The 2012 edition of our political dictionary calls these people the ""job creators."" They built that. And so on. The Bible-sized novel is broken into three long ""books,"" so Aglialoro and Kaslow have broken it, faithfully, into three two-hour movies. In Part 1, released early last year, we met the rail company COO Dagny Taggart, the only member of her family business who'd rather take bold, sexy risks than wait for doughy bureaucrats to redistribute wealth for her. She meets Hank Rearden, a billionaire metallurgist who's invented a product ""cheaper, stronger, and lighter"" than steel. They build a new line and name it after John Galt, a mysterious genius who--coincidentally!--was the first of his kind to vanish and leave a bunch of grubbing, venal government bureaucrats behind to ""loot"" his good works. Since that movie came out, and made back around a quarter of its budget (""Zero percent on Rotten Tomatoes,"" laughs Aglialoro), the Atlas story has mushroomed. Rep. Paul Ryan was picked to join Mitt Romney's Republican ticket. A scandal-curious media dug into Ryan's recent past and discovered that he loved Rand, loved Atlas, had given a speech about it to the Atlas Society--of which Aglialoro's a member. ""The effect of Romney choosing Paul Ryan was bringing Ayn Rand back into the news,"" says Kaslow. ""From our perspective, promoting this movie, we need to connect the dots for someone who's interested in economics, get him or her interested in the film."" After a short break, we head in from the meeting room to the screening room. For all the mockery, for all the liberal gloating about box-office numbers, the first Atlas film accidentally cast too many successful actors. Taylor Schilling, the original Dagny Taggart, went on to co-star in The Lucky One and the upcoming Ben Affleck movie about the Iran hostage crisis.  ""She's a bona fide movie star now,"" says Aglialoro. So she's been replaced by Samantha Mathis, a '90s star who's been mounting a kind of comeback. The rest of the cast is also new. It's libertarian cinema by way of Doctor Who. And it completely changes the tone of the story. Schilling's Taggart was all ice and sneers, storming into meetings without disturbing her bouffant. Mathis replaces the sneer with a pout. ""Where are they?"" she asks her assistant Eddie, as they ride through an emptied-out Manhattan, fueled by $40/gallon gas. ""Where are the people who could make a difference?"" ""I'm sitting next to one of them,"" says Eddie. Taggart/Mathis holds back a sigh. Our Rearden in Atlas I was Grant Bowler, who treated the character like a smart fed-up tech whiz beset by Asperger's syndrome. He's been replaced by Jason Beghe, who woke up hung-over and crammed his mouth full of gravel. His wife catches him coming home from a night with Dagny (in a very un-Rand touch, we don't see them having sex), and he dares her to divorce him while he changes into fresh clothes. This casting change definitely works. Rearden has to deliver the big speech of Part II, when he's called in to a star chamber for selling his metal to a friend and violating the government's new ""Fair Share"" law. (In the novel, it's the ""Equalization of Opportunity"" law.) On the page, Rearden's speech is pretentious in all the best ways. ""It is not your particular policy I challenge, but your moral premise,"" he says. ""If it were true that men could achieve their good by means of turning some men into sacrificial animals, and I were asked to immolate myself for the sake of creatures who wanted to survive at the price of my blood, if I were asked to serve the interests of society apart from, above, and against my own--I would refuse."" Onscreen, Rearden/Beghe boils this down into a short defense of ""job creators."" And it works! The Rand-curious audience wants to stand up and cheer for this hard-working, word-chewing businessman who's just trying to pour some damn metal. But that really is the high point. We get two action scenes--a plane chase and two trains colliding in the ""Taggart Tunnel""--but the fullness of Rand's message can only be delivered through boardroom scenes and phone calls and meetings in Washington. Most of these scenes are deadly. Your fun, as a viewer, may come from an impromptu game of ""hey, it's that guy!"" The chairman of the Taggart board--Biff from Back to the Future. The ""head of state"" (not president)--Ray Wise, the evil dad from Twin Peaks. The talkative security guard--funny enough, that's Teller of Penn & Teller, protecting her from people waving ""We Are the 99%!"" signs. When the third installment comes, in July 2014, we'll probably get another all-new cast. ""It's hard to lock people down,"" says Aglialoro. It's the great cultural paradox of the Tea Party age. Rand's dramatic work of dystopian horror can teach Republicans how to think, but it's teeth-pullingly hard to keep distributors and audiences interested. ""The left dismisses Ayn Rand,"" he says. ""The version of her that they attack is childish, it's a cartoon."" But he understands why."" I wish she didn't say 'selfishness' as she did. That she was for 'selfishness.' She was human, and probably meant that in a rhetorical way. But if she was on this earth again, maybe she'd put it another way."""	Atlas Shrugged II Is Deadly. Not in a Good Way.

Today brought welcome news on that front. While it had previously seemed likely that Democrats would lose the Senate, the FiveThirtyEight Forecasting model now gives Democrats a 79 percent chance of controlling it, up from just 39 percent a month ago. Politico also highlighted three Democratic candidates who have gained solid leads in recent days: Elizabeth Warren, ahead by 2-6 points in Massachusetts; Tammy Baldwin, ahead by 9 points in Wisconsin; and Tim Kaine, ahead by 7-8 points in Virginia. These Senate races reflect well on the top of the ticket, too--Obama also leads in Massachusetts, Wisconsin, and Virginia. If Democrats can keep this up, maybe they'll hold on to the presidency and Senate after all. See Barack Obama's good news from Day 48, Day 49, and Day 50. See today's good news for Mitt Romney.

""I strongly endorse symbolic gestures toward groups,"" wrote Buchanan, ""especially the blacks where symbols count for so much."" In order to divide the country effectively, Nixon had to pretend that he wasn't dividing it at all. ""The President is President of all the people and while they will never vote for us, we must never let them come to believe we don't give a damn about them--or that they are outside our province of concern."" Forty-two years and four months later, an older, more widow's-peaked Buchanan appeared on Fox News to explain the leaked video of Mitt Romney talking to donors. Had Romney stumbled when he wrote off the ""47 percent"" of voters too dependent to vote Republican? No, said Buchanan. ""Barack Obama is a drug dealer of welfare. He wants permanent dependency, in my judgment, of all these folks."" Spot the difference! The younger, wiser Buchanan argued that a president (presidential candidate, in this case) should avoid telling voters just how much he needs them to splinter if he's going to win. The new Buchanan, who's been a pundit since Paul Ryan was listening to Led Zeppelin on a Walkman, is ready for a guns-a-blazing debate about lazy moochers versus broad-shouldered job creators. It's not just Buchanan saying this. As the ""47 percent"" saga drags on, a sizable group of conservatives are telling Romney to stand by the argument. Romney is standing by it, which is probably the best of a bunch of bad options. First of all, what would he gain if he said he was lying to a bunch of gullible rich people? And second, there's a team of conservatives giving him terrible advice, telling him to make a general election message out of this story. They're saying what Pat Buchanan is saying. ""Any Republican running for president has to acknowledge we're not going to get that 47 percent of the electorate,"" said Ann Coulter, who's promoting a new book this month. ""We could probably tell 40 states it's very expensive, you don't really need to vote. We just need to have 10 states vote. They're the only one who we're not sure about."" On his Tuesday night show--the first to mention the tape--Sean Hannity credited Romney with ""one of his sharpest critiques yet of President Obama and the entitlement society that he enables"" and insisted that ""conservatives and fiscally conscious Americans are applauding Governor Romney's statements."" On his radio show, Rush Limbaugh called the video ""a golden opportunity,"" because ""work is how you become independent,"" and voters needed someone to tell them. The big idea, on the right, is that as the ratio of ""takers"" to ""makers"" increases, America risks hitting a ""tipping point"" after which the takers will overwhelm the system. In 2009 and 2010, Tea Partiers bought bumper stickers and signs that read ""Redistribute My Work Ethic, Not My Wealth,"" and ""Keep Working: Millions on Welfare Depend on You!"" When conservatives tell Romney to come out and say this, they're revealing what Julian Sanchez has called ""epistemic closure."" They know this is true. Their trusted media sources tell them that it's true. Why not talk about it? Because 1970 Pat Buchanan told you so, that's why. It's fine for someone like Sen. Jim DeMint to suggest that America will collapse if more people don't start paying income taxes. But a presidential candidate has to pretend that he's reaching out to everyone, with hope and no prejudice. Neither Mitt Romney nor Barack Obama expects to reach more than 51 or 52 percent of the electorate this year. Both of them want to max out turnout among the demographic groups that favor them. They just can't admit it. Here's what I mean. Way back in November 2011, back when Newt Gingrich was going to be the Republican presidential nominee, the progressive Center for American Progress published a curiously optimistic paper about Barack Obama's chances. The president's record was terrible. His 2008 rainbow coalition was fading as working-class white voters sprinted away from Democrats. Lucky enough, in 2012, Obama wouldn't have to worry so much about those voters, according to the liberal think tank. The new map would bring out more nonwhite votes than ever before, and more college-educated whites who hadn't joined the Tea Party. ""The underlying demographic composition of the white vote,"" wrote researchers Ruy Texiera and John Halpin, ""is likely to shift in Obama's favor in the 2012 election."" When Tom Edsall read this, he reported a straightforward New York Times analysis with a catchy lede. Democrats, he wrote, were giving up ""all pretense of trying to win a majority of the white working class."" That appeared on the Drudge Report as ""NYT: Obama campaign set to abandon white working class."" It bounced onto Fox News, where Bill Bennett told Sean Hannity that Obama's team ""may avoid the white working class Democrats and put their strategy somewhere else."" The Obama campaign hadn't actually said anything about the ""strategy."" But it was true. Since that article was published, President Obama has come out in favor of gay marriage, deferred the Keystone XL pipeline, and instructed the Department of Homeland Security to lay off on deportations of under-30 illegal immigrants. The Republican National Convention was a love song to businessmen who ""build that"" and to Mitt Romney, family man. The Democratic National Convention was a checklist acted out by lifelike politicians and grateful citizens, thanking Obama for all the bones he'd thrown them. The strategy is obvious but unspoken. Imagine what would happen if a vengeful waiter, or Richard Nixon's angry grandson, recorded Obama at a fundraiser, dishing about his plan to drive up nonwhite and college-educated-white turnout, and win. That would hurt him, just like the ""47 percent"" tape hurts Romney. The obvious strategy isn't typically the strategy you're supposed to talk about. You just deploy it. As Talking Points Memo's Brian Beutler points out, Nixon took Buchanan's advice and managed to make a class argument that divided the Democratic base. One of his most effective TV ads attacked George McGovern on legislation that would have established ""guaranteed income"" for all Americans. ""The McGovern bill would make 47 percent of people in the United States eligible for welfare,"" warned a narrator. ""Forty-seven percent."""	Even Pat Buchanan Doesn't Believe the Advice He's Giving Mitt Romney

Last month, the president was down by five points in Colorado. In a CBS poll, he is now leading in that state by one point, 48 percent to 47 percent. In Virginia, Obama has a four-point lead over Romney and has reached the magical 50 percent mark. In Wisconsin, the one Obama state where Republicans had hoped to make inroads, Obama is now ahead by six. He had been down by two after the Paul Ryan pick. A new Fox poll shows Obama up by seven in both Ohio (49-42 percent) and Virginia (50-43 percent), and Obama up by five in Florida (49-44 percent).

Voters ""are looking for 'how is this going to make my life better?' "" said Gillespie. ""We also know that they'd like to know more about specifics. We are going to meet that demand."" The Romney campaign is either getting antsy or the candidate and his advisers have suddenly decided to remake their low-risk campaign into one that is aggressively entrepreneurial. This is the second time in less than a week that the Romney campaign has launched a bold gambit. Last week, when turmoil erupted in the Middle East, Romney decided to criticize the president amid the early rounds of chaos. Now he's not only changing course but also making the unusual move of announcing the course correction. Why all the activity? Romney aides insist it has nothing to do with polls. While some national polls show Obama leading, and some polls in battleground states look that way too, aides point to the Rasmussen poll and the Gallup tracking poll that show Obama's post-convention bounce disappearing. They also say this new tack isn't a response to the criticism that arrived Sunday in a Politico article, which amounted to a turducken of nitpicking, stuffed inside a hefty helping of carping, wrapped in a shell of sniping. But if the new aggressive posture is not tinged with a whiff of panic, the campaign will have to come up with a more plausible rationale. Because, for much of the campaign, the Romney team has responded to these criticisms with a reassuring placidity. Steady as she goes, has been the response. As of today, a few more people are rushing toward the boiler room. (And late Monday it was all hands on deck. A video surfaced showing Romney writing off the 47 percent of the country that plans to vote for Obama as shiftless government leeches who don't pay income taxes; having the candidate offer such a precise percentage was not what the campaign meant by specificity.) The move to specificity is welcome. For starters, perhaps it will nudge the president along. (What are those long-term plans for Medicare anyway, sir?) But this is not the Romney campaign's first go at this. When Mitt Romney picked Paul Ryan as his running mate, aides heralded the choice as a bold plan to run on a specific set of ideas. The conservatives who had been complaining during the early summer saw the Ryan pick that way, too, and started writing opinion articles praising Romney's boldness. But then Ryan didn't campaign so much on brave new ideas as much as on Obama's flaws. That prompted another bout of complaining from conservative wise men last week. So what can we expect from the Romney campaign this time? One possibility is that this whole pivot to specificity could be nothing more than a sop to pundits. It is a time-honored political trick to announce a move to do a certain thing and then hope that announcing the move absolves you from having to actually make the move you're heralding. Obama administration aides have repeatedly sounded off about their boss's ""pivot to jobs,"" for example. Another possibility is that Romney finally starts making the pitch for his policies that connects with people's hopes for the future. Gillespie explained that is what Gov. Romney would do in new ads, speeches, and briefings. So when he says that the United States is going to be energy independent by 2020, he'll explain that he'll get there through approving the Keystone pipeline, offering more drilling rights for offshore exploration, and lifting the moratorium on drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. No one should mistake this gambit for a self-administered truth serum. If that were the case, Gov. Romney would start campaigning on a detailed explanation of how his premium support plan for Medicare would actually work, the assumptions behind it, and how--other than simply asking us to trust him--he's going to maintain quality while lowering health care costs. That's a standard the Obama campaign would like him to meet--be so specific that we can savage you, please. But no modern politician is going to go that far into the fine print, including President Obama. On the other hand, if your running mate has a detailed set of plans for transforming Medicare and Social Security in his jacket pocket (as Paul Ryan does) and you choose to only get specific about energy policy, then you're trying to hide something. We also shouldn't expect any more specificity on how Romney will get his budget numbers to add up. When Paul Ryan was asked what loopholes he would close, he said the campaign would offer only a ""framework"" that they would then work out after the election. This showed a wise understanding of how legislation works, he argued. Gov. Romney didn't want to present Congress with a plan and simply ask them to pass it. He wanted Congress to have a role. If we take this argument at face value, then Ryan has offered a nearly identical rationale for vagueness as President Obama. Though, when the Obama administration argues for ""frameworks,"" they are ridiculed for a lack of leadership. Mitt Romney's move to specifics is almost as bold as his move last week to blame the president for the violence in the Middle East that led to the death of four Americans in Libya, including the U.S. ambassador. A Pew poll suggests that gambit hasn't worked so well for the moment. Only 26 percent of those following events in Libya approve of Romney's handling of the issue. Perhaps he'll have better luck with this strategy, though he doesn't have much time. There are only a couple of weeks until the first debate and just 50 days until the election to make policy differences clear. That's not much time. Then again, to be fair, a week ago some in the campaign didn't think they needed to wrestle with these issues--at least, not specifically."	Why Is the Romney Campaign Acting So Antsy?

The polls are tight. But the polls have always been tight. Each campaign, and its supporters, must plumb the data and the trends to find any evidence that they're breaking through. Whether you are rooting for Barack Obama or Mitt Romney, you have reasons to feel insecure about your candidate's chances. You want to believe, but you know you have reasons to doubt. So every day until the election, Slate will offer up one reason to be optimistic for your candidate, one ray of hope to believe your camp may just win this thing. 50 days to go: Today's Good News for Obama: In Wisconsin, a friendly poll taken by her own Senate campaign gives Rep. Tammy Baldwin a lead over former Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson. The Republican's ""unfavorable rating has grown to 46 percent,"" says the pollster, ""in the wake of advertising on his special interest ties."" Baldwin's climb is much steeper than Obama's--Thompson is considered much more popular in Wisconsin than Mitt Romney. But this suggests that a post-convention focus on the GOP's actual candidates is benefiting Democrats. All of them. Obama, too. If his base turns out anything like the rate it did in 2008, his party wins. See today's good news for Mitt Romney."	Why Today Was a Good Day for Barack Obama

Rep. Paul Ryan has just finished speaking to the annual Values Voter Summit, the final pre-election conference of social conservatives. He smiled through two ineffective hecklings--Ryan is quite good at turning those into applause breaks--and got the audience cheering for Mitt Romney, for the ""moral clarity"" of his foreign policy, for the threatened ""religious liberty"" of churches. Everybody else swooned, then filed out of the room to grab lunch. Fischer, whose American Family Association co-sponsors this event, wasn't swooning. ""He didn't say one single word about marriage,"" says Fischer. ""This is the safest environment in the United States of America to talk about marriage. I've got to believe that that came from on top. Marriage won 61-39 in North Carolina--in 2012! That's in a state that President Obama won in 2008. Marriage is a winner. It's just a mystery to me that they won't touch this thing."" He shrugs. ""Mitt Romney should be leading by 10 or 15 points. The fact that he's not is Mitt Romney's problem. It's because he's run such a lackluster campaign that's been so vague on ideas."" The Values Voters Summits began in 2006, based on a simple premise: The voters who had brought the GOP to power were being disrespected. Twenty-two percent of voters had told exit pollsters that ""moral values"" motivated them. Democrats, engaged in their quadrennial bout of hand-wringing, agreed that social issues had befuddled the country and cost them a victory. Fast-forward to now. President Barack Obama supports gay marriage and refuses to defend the Defense of Marriage Act. He signed a health care bill that lowers the cost of birth control coverage. He reversed the Reagan-era ban on aid to international family planning programs. He nominated and saw confirmed two pro-abortion-rights Supreme Court justices. One in five voters still think the guy's a Muslim.* And he's winning. Romney-Ryan didn't get much of a convention bounce, but the president did. New polls in swing states that Republicans cannot afford to lose--Ohio, Virginia--show the president in the lead. This wasn't supposed to happen after Labor Day, when conservatives expected tighter voter models (the all-important ""likely voters"") to show Romney ahead. So conservatives are talking themselves into optimism. ""Before you decide the election is over based on September polls,"" writes Mike Huckabee in an email to supporters, ""remember that coming out of the 1988 Democratic convention, Gallup showed an insurmountable 17-point lead for that great former president, Michael Dukakis."" Walking around the conference, I heard the Tale of Dukakis again and again. But the story leaves out how George H.W. Bush's convention came after Dukakis, and he made the most of the opportunity to erase that lead. Like every ""maybe this time will be like that time"" analysis, it leaves out the demographic and culture shifts that have made it easier for a Democrat to put together 270 electoral votes. Conservatives have started to process that. ""There's a growing segment of the American population that is dependent on government funds and largesse,"" says Dean Welty, an activist from Virginia. ""Many of them give the Obama administration credit for that. We have the largest number of people on welfare we've ever had. We have the largest number of people on unemployment. It's not good for the country, but it's good for Obama."" Most of the Values voters I talk to end up delivering a version of this theory. Ryan's speech targeted Obama for ""more people in poverty, and less upward mobility wherever you look."" If you've paid enough attention to Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh, you see this as intentional. The books on sale on the way into the main ballroom include Spreading the Wealth: How Obama Is Robbing the Suburbs To Pay for the Cities. ""Forty-seven million on food stamps and the regime is advertising for more,"" said Limbaugh in July. ""We have 47, 48 percent who pay no income taxes. We have 3 million more off the unemployment rolls and on the disability rolls, and they all vote."" At the conference, I hear the same argument from a businessman and a self-publishing author, William Been. ""When you figure that 47 million of us are receiving food stamps today--which is double the number from four years ago--that's a way, possibly, for people in poverty to feel better about themselves."" In other words, voters are being bribed. Gary Bauer, the deathless evangelical leader who still fills seats at these sorts of events, uses his afternoon speech to name and shame the moochers. ""There's a lot of people out now around America who depend on checks from their fellow taxpayers being in the mailbox every day,"" Bauer says. ""They will turn out in massive numbers."" You hear enough of this misery, and you start thinking about the endgame. What if Mitt Romney actually manages to blow this election? The Values Voters will never say that he failed to win the center, because they won't believe it. They'll say that he never drew the contrast between what Obama was doing to America and how he and Paul Ryan, specifically, would fix it. They'll say that this left evangelical voters--few of whom liked Romney in the first placed--disengaged. Standing near one of the conference's banks of water coolers, I notice William Temple. This is not hard to do. Temple, the ""Tea Party patriot,"" dresses in various Colonial costumes and yells, ""Huzzah!"" when he hears something he likes. He's the first person that bemused members of the foreign press try to interview, because the image is just too good. He trekked up to D.C. from Georgia and managed to get all kinds of clattering metal props through security. He's worried, too. ""We picked probably the weakest candidate we could,"" says Temple. ""Someone like a Herman Cain or a Michele Bachmann would have 'em fired up."" Corrections, Sept. 17, 2012: This article originally stated that the Obama administration is not enforcing DOMA. In fact, it is not defending DOMA in court. Because of a copy-editing error, it stated that Obama ""appointed two anti-abortion Supreme Court justices."" He nominated two pro-abortion-rights justices. (Return to the corrected paragraph.)"	Why the Religious Right Thinks Romney Is Losing
13	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/09/libya_consulate_killing_mitt_romney_s_criticism_of_barack_obama_on_libya_and_egypt_was_an_accurate_reflection_of_what_he_really_believes_.html	"Mitt Romney did not ""gaffe"" about the protest at the U.S. Embassy in Egypt or the killing of diplomats at the Benghazi Consulate. The whole concept of the ""gaffe"" has been Silly-Putty-ed into meaninglessness by campaign 2012, yes, but that's not what I mean. What Mitt Romney said about the attacks, fact-challenged as it was, synced up neatly with what he's been saying about foreign policy for years. To understand this, you have to roll up your sleeves, clear your afternoon, and look at the cover of Romney's book, No Apology. The candidate's foreign policy boils down into two big, star-spangled concepts. No. 1: The job of the president is to speak up for America, all the time, through a megaphone if necessary. No. 2: Barack Obama, who does not speak like this, is the second coming of Jimmy Carter. The embassy debacles in Libya and Egypt allowed Romney to hit both themes. Yes, in order to do that, he had to bungle his timing. Early on Tuesday, before the protests had caused any violence, the U.S. Embassy in Cairo released a statement on a viral and moronic anti-Islam video making the media rounds locally. The embassy criticized ""continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims."" Romney's statement got the timing wrong and asserted that the embassy's statement was ""the Obama Administration's first response"" to killings. No. It would be hours before the U.S. Ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, was killed. But Romney's specific accusation was that the administration ""sympathize[d] with those who waged the attacks."" He's said that for years. In the Romney cosmos, the president is on a constant ""apology tour,"" one that started in 2009, when he came to Cairo University ""to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world.""  That, said Romney, was the wrong tone. And when the administration didn't buck up protests in the wake of rigged Iranian elections, it became a ridiculous tone. ""The words spoken by the leader of the free world can expand the frontiers of freedom or shrink them,"" wrote Romney in his pre-campaign book. So Romney viewed the embassy attacks as a way to point this out. As the pot boiled over today, a Romney adviser reminded me that the president gave his first formal post-inauguration TV interview not to Fox News, not to CNN, not to Russia Today, but to al-Arabiya. This was part of the presidential debate, so why not have it out? On Capitol Hill today, it wasn't hard at all to find Republicans who agreed. ""Gov. Romney, in the big picture, was right,"" said Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House homeland security committee. (Like many Republicans who work on security issues, he spent the day in scrums with reporters.) ""The only question I would have--again, I'm not running for president--I probably would have waited 12 to 24 hours before I put out a comprehensive statement. It can be misinterpreted when something tragic happens."" But that was literally King's only question. He counted off a list of apparent sops to violent Muslims, ""going back to the president's apology tour of 2009; the statement put out by the embassy in Egypt [that] was too reflective of an accomodationist mood toward jihadists, toward violence; the treatment of Prime Minister Netanyahu."" This is what Romney's foreign-policy shop thinks. By every indication, it's what he thinks. What might have happened had he made the same timing blunder with his statement but said something innocuous about how all Americans were watching the situation? Nothing. But we wouldn't have gotten an honest view of Romney's position. Republicans and Romney strategists like to compare this campaign to 1980. Obama, they say, is Carter's clone. The polls broke heavily for Reagan after the 1980 debates; maybe this time, the election will break wide open for Romney. Yesterday, when the words ""embassy"" appeared on the wires, the Carter comparisons were born anew. The 1979-1981 Iranian hostage crisis loomed over the entire Reagan-Carter campaign. Reagan didn't duck the issue. He ran to Carter's right, pledging to get the hostages out. After the Desert One debacle in April 1980--an attempt to free the hostages, ruined by local weather conditions--Reagan used it to reiterate his own position. ""I support the president in his attempt to rescue our people in Iran,"" Reagan said at a rally in El Paso, Texas. ""As a matter of fact, I would have supported it six months ago."" In the general election, he outsourced the hostage crisis attack to Ted Kennedy, who'd attacked Carter on the issue. Still, the better analogue for Romney might be Barack Obama himself. In 2007, several times, the then-senator made foreign policy statements that were outside the polite consensus--and thus defined as ""gaffes."" Obama said he'd violate Pakistani sovereignty if it would help nab terrorists. Romney, at the time, called that ""ill-considered."" Obama never backed down. Later, at a debate where questions came from earnest YouTube members, Obama agreed to meet the leaders of Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela ""without preconditions"" in his first year as president. That, too, became part of Obama's ""foreign policy,"" defended throughout the campaign. Nobody really noticed that Obama broke his promise. He'd previewed the talk-pretty-but-approve-drone-strikes strategy he'd use in office. Romney's ""gaffe"" was in this vein. It was an accidental treatise on a foreign policy that's getting ignored in the day-to-day. As the hunt for the murderers in Libya goes on, four months before the next presidential inauguration, let's give him some credit."	Romney's Criticism of Obama's Foreign Policy Was No Gaffe

Followers of Ayn Rand paid up to $735 for the whole shebang. No media joined them. So, when the panel on the libertarian Cato Institute's future began, people felt safe to talk straight. John Allison took the stage, joined by Ayn Rand Institute President Yaron Brook. It had been only a few days since Cato ended a months-long conflict between Cato's current management and the increasingly active mega-donors Charles and David Koch. The deal ousted Ed Crane, Cato's president since its founding, in favor of Allison, the affable former CEO of BB&T. The detente, according to Cato brass, was partially engineered by Allison himself. Brook wasn't overly interested in the spat. He wanted Allison to explain where Cato was headed. Two unaffiliated Randians in the audience, Earl Pearson and Arthur Zey, opened their phones and live-tweeted the conversation. This is the only public record anyone has of Allison revealing how he'd remold Cato in the Ayn Rand image. Time for a little Kremlinology. What's the difference between a Cato Institute libertarian and an Ayn Rand objectivist? Cato's libertarianism is a theory of government. Objectivism is a theory of life. Rand's philosophy, as close watchers of the presidential race have started to learn, insists that ""the pursuit of [man's] own rational self-interest and of his own happiness is the highest moral purpose of his life."" The way this strikes in the real world--the way it separates objectivists from other libertarians--is in foreign policy. Since the war on terror broke out, Cato's been a bunker for non-interventionists. Its foreign-policy shop is staffed with critics of the Iraq war. Objectivists don't see foreign policy that way. The Ayn Rand Institute, founded in 1985 by Rand's intellectual/financial heir Leonard Peikoff, has spun off arguments for war rooted in a philosophy of self-preservation. Shortly after 9/11, the man who'd inherited a movement and $750,000 from Rand published ""End States Who Sponsor Terrorism,"" whose title summed it up. ""The choice today is mass death in the United States or mass death in the terrorist nations,"" wrote Peikoff. ""The greatest obstacle to U.S. victory is not Iran and its allies, but our own intellectuals."" After the occupation of Iraq turned sour, the Ayn Rand Institute's Yaron Brook--sort of the successor to the successor--was arguing that the United States ""embrace[d] compassion instead of the rational goal of victory, and that ""such an immoral approach to war wantonly sacrifices the lives of soldiers and emboldens our enemies throughout the Middle East to mount further attacks against us."" This was pure Objectivism. ""Eschewing self-interest in the name of compassion is immoral."" And that was the context in San Diego, at the grilling of Cato's new president. The Ayn Rand Institute has not made public any recording of the Q&A, though Jeremy Lott, who broke the story, has been asking after it for weeks. According to Pearson--one of the participants live-tweeting the event--Brook started the discussion with a reminder--the ""old school"" libertarians were ""enemies of Objectivism."" Allison assured Brook that the Kochs were admirers of Rand. What did that mean for Allison's new think tank? According to Pearson's paraphrase, Allison described Cato as ""a mixed bag: healthcare policy research excellent; foreign policy bad; intellectual property mixed but not too bad."" Pearson summed up Allison's goal: ""to apply his Objectivist ideals at Cato. As w/his history of bank acquisitions expects good [people] to stay and bad to go."" Zey, the other live tweeter, wrote that Allison would ""oust out elements in Cato that disrespect Rand and JA's philosophy."" Pearson continued: Allison ""expects challenges in the area of reforming foreign policy there but seems to look forward to the challenge."" This was followed by a direct quote from Allison, via Zey: ""Cato will become a more Objectivist organization."" None of this should have surprised Cato-ites. Allison had been involved with the Ayn Rand Institute for years, and starting in 2009, he'd stepped up his public schedule and given talks about how Atlas Shrugged was coming true in Obama's America. He'd appeared in a documentary about this, and he'd written one of the introductions to a businessman's-guide-to-Rand book by Ayn Rand Institute scholars. But Paul Ryan shares a lot of the same sentiments, and he's no objectivist. In his Q&A, Allison took every chance to get closer to Rand. Brook nudged him on a question that has sparked intra-objectivist feuds. Did he consider himself a libertarian? ""I don't have the energy to fight a label,"" said Allison, according to Zey. ""I'm not a libertarian."" It took more than a month for these quotes to circulate. Once they did, it took no time at all for agita to break out inside the think tank. On Aug. 30, Allison sent an e-mail to Cato staff acknowledging the controversy: ""Internet chatter based on 'tweets' from the Q and A."" He could explain. ""I was being 'grilled' at the event and will not guarantee that my answers were the best. Also, I was still learning about Cato. However, in the many sessions I have had with employees at Cato my answers have been totally straightforward."" The Cato-Koch deal had effectively ended the conflict between the think tankers and the funders. Why rip that up over some tweets? ""Now that I have a deeper understanding about Cato,"" wrote Allison. ""I believe almost all the name calling between libertarians and objectivists is irrational. I have come to appreciate that all objectivists are libertarians, but not all libertarians are objectivists."" And that's all Allison's said about the San Diego panel. ""My e-mail was intended as a private communication to the Cato staff,"" he wrote when I reached him last week. ""I do not see any benefit in discussing it further at this time."" The Ayn Rand Institute's  Brook is out of the country; the live-tweeters have kept their opus online but decided against saying more. But what else should Allison, et al, say? He's never tried to cover up his Objectivism. In 2001, after Peikoff published newspaper ads making the ""end states"" argument, he posted in a Randian message board about how it came together. ""I had a lot of help which I want to acknowledge,"" wrote Peikoff. ""John Allison was my primary inspiration and unfailing morale-booster; he suggested the ads in the first place, and then, with another donor, financed them."""	Is the Cato Institute Ruled by Ayn Rand?
15	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/09/newt_gingrich_todd_akin_and_david_duke_will_the_gop_forgive_legitimate_rape_.html	"When Rep. Todd Akin, the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Missouri, made his infamous comments about ""legitimate rape,"" the party's national leaders abandoned him. They urged him to step down so they could substitute a more electable nominee. Akin refused. Today was the deadline for him to withdraw. He's staying in the race. And some Republican leaders are creeping back in to support him. Mike Huckabee is sticking with Akin. Phyllis Schlafly is doing a bus tour for him. The Senate Conservatives Fund, headed by Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., is seeking support from its donors to help Akin. And yesterday, Newt Gingrich went to Missouri to headline a $500-a-plate fund-raiser for him. Gingrich says party leaders have no business shunning a candidate chosen by voters. ""The people of Missouri picked him to be their nominee in a fair fight,"" Gingrich told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. At yesterday's fund-raiser, Gingrich asked: ""What's the moral case for not backing the Republican nominee picked by the people of Missouri?"" In a radio interview, he elaborated: I just think it is so profoundly wrong for the big-money boys in Washington to decide they can dictate to the people of Missouri or Georgia or any other state. Todd Akin won the nomination. ... He is clearly the candidate of the people of Missouri. ... People who donate to the [Republican] Senate committee should be calling and raising Cain and saying, ""What do you mean you're not going to be for the Republican nominee in Missouri?"" That isn't what Gingrich said when he was one of the party's big-money boys. In 1986, Gingrich became general chairman of GOPAC, an organization dedicated to supporting conservative Republican candidates. Three years into his tenure, David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klansman, won a seat in the Louisiana legislature as a Republican. Duke formally renounced his past racist affiliations, but Gingrich--who was a month away from being elected to the second highest Republican post in the U.S. House of Representatives--refused to accept him. ''This is a man whose record is one of ... race-baiting,'' Gingrich insisted. ''The Republican Party wants to make clear that we do not condone, we do not tolerate, race-baiting.'' In 1991, 56 percent of Louisiana Republicans voted for Duke for governor. But a year later, as Duke prepared to run for president, Gingrich repeated that Duke ""should be shunned."" Last month, many national Republicans took a similar stance toward Akin. After Akin said that an abortion ban need not include an exception for rape because ""if it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down,"" GOP leaders said the party had to make clear that it didn't condone his views. Gingrich takes a different view. Now that the subject is sexism rather than racism, he advocates forgiveness, tolerance, and Republican solidarity. He defends Akin's abortion views and says Akin's opponent, Sen. Claire McCaskill, ""stands for the kind of abortion rules that are just totally unacceptable to most decent Americans."" Gingrich calls Akin's comment a ""six-second mistake"" and says Akin should be forgiven because he ""admitted he made a mistake and apologized for it."" That's a whitewash. Akin's problem with rape, like Duke's problem with race, goes back decades. He's been a rape skeptic since the days when Duke was running for governor. And Akin has never apologized for that. In his so-called apology, Akin asserted, ""The mistake I made was in the words I said, not in the heart I hold."" This doesn't seem to trouble Gingrich. ""I can't imagine,"" he exclaims in disbelief, that the Republican National Committee ""would want to risk losing Missouri for Romney by getting into some kind of divisive schismatic fight."" Race is a red line, but rape is just a schism. Akin never wore a hood, and 2012 is a long way from 1991. You can argue that the two cases are different. But Gingrich, Huckabee, DeMint, and other Republicans haven't made that case. They haven't explained why, if racial prejudice disqualifies a popularly chosen candidate from national Republican support, rape skepticism doesn't. Until they do, the simplest explanation is that a history of second-guessing women about rape doesn't bother these Republicans morally--or at least politically--the way that a history of racism does. If you have a better answer, gentlemen, let's hear it. William Saletan's latest short takes on the news, via Twitter: "	"Will Republicans Forgive ""Legitimate Rape""?"

Well, it turns out the middle class likes Mitt Romney. The Republican presidential candidate has maintained a sizeable lead among middle-class families, holding a 14-point advantage over Obama. (Fifty-one percent of middle-class voters have an unfavorable view of the president, while 54 percent disapprove of his job performance.) In a nearly tied election, those differences could be extremely consequential: Middle-class families make up about 54 percent of the voting population, and both candidates have been wooing them intensely. These voters are crucial for capturing swing states like Ohio and Virginia, and so far--despite all of his missteps--Romney still has the advantage with every politician's favorite demographic. See today's good news for Barack Obama. See Mitt Romney's good news from Friday.	Why Today Was a Good Day for Mitt Romney
17	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/09/obama_virginia_support_day_46_ray_of_hope_for_obama_.html	"Every day until the election, Slate will offer up one reason to be optimistic for your candidate. 46 days to go: Today's Good News for Obama: My morning and early afternoon were absorbed in the Obama campaign bubble, as the president dropped into Woodbridge, Va.--literally, in a helicopter and everything. (It did land before he got out.) Doors opened at 8 a.m., for the people with coveted red passes. The stands of a baseball diamond--which sat 6,000--were full by 10:30 or so, two hours before the president was to arrive. When Obama spoke, his volume was challenged by a woman named Kim McAlister, who cheered and atta-boyed literally everything the president said, occasionally alternating into cries of ""I love you Barack!"" But what struck me was just how many non-white voters were packed into the venue. Woodbridge is a largely non-white city, in an exurban county that Democrats carry when they win the state. Republicans have tried to convince these voters that Obama failed them. If they don't buy it, and they volunteer and vote again, Obama wins this state and closes off one of Romney's paths.

He says he can turn around the country. But first he must show he can do it with his campaign. When Barack Obama was running for president in 2008, he and his surrogates argued that the way he ran his campaign was a proxy for how he would govern. The one-term senator had to make this case because he had no experience running anything. Romney is pitching himself as the exact opposite: He is so experienced he can turn around anything. Whether it's your company or your Olympics, he knows how to walk in, figure out what's wrong, and fix it. Of course, the Romney campaign's public posture is that nothing is going wrong. That's natural enough. It is in the handbook that you don't ever admit anything is running off the rails, even as you quietly get things back on track. The campaign got good news Thursday that helped them make the case that the situation was not as in need of change as the chattering class might think. The Gallup daily tracking poll shows that the race is tied. With 47 days left until Election Day, President Obama gets 47 percent and Mitt Romney gets 47 percent. Given Romney's recent comments about the 47 percent, it's clear that Gallup has a sense of humor. (We must remember to invite Gallup over for dinner some time--or at least cocktails.) What better trait of a leader than not twitching at every sign of worry and discontent from supporters? Romney has had plenty of practice. He has had to go through the process of assuring his backers that there are no monsters under the bed several times. But time is drawing short, so changes are taking place. Romney's aides say he will start to get more specific about what he will do if he's elected. He's named policies before, but that hasn't done the trick. Now he's going to try to explain how his policies can affect people in their daily lives. That transaction requires the spark of connection, something Romney has not had so far. To help make that connection, the Romney campaign says the candidate is going to spend less time fundraising and more time directly asking for votes on the campaign trail. He's put together a ""bus tour"" in Ohio, though it may just be a string of events held in proximity of a bus rather than a proper bus tour. In his television ads, he is going to start talking directly to the camera, in an effort to create some kind of bond. This is where the recently revealed video of Romney speaking at a Boca Raton, Fla., fundraiser could be an impediment. To make his pitch, Romney can't risk turning off voters. The fellow openly dismissing 47 percent of the country did not come across as very appealing. Because Romney lacks retail political skills, it's hard for him to make connections that might be as indelible as on that secretly recorded video. As one Republican campaign veteran said, ""I felt like when I was watching that video that it was the first time I'd ever seen the real Mitt Romney."" So Romney needs to appear genuine again--just not in a way that insults half the country. To execute this new plan, Romney will need all the skills he says he would bring to the presidency. He needs to articulate the vision for the remaining 47 days, commit his team to it, and execute relentlessly. As he wrote in Turnaround: Crisis, Leadership, and the Olympic Games, ""focus, focus, focus. Turnarounds that failed did so because management tried to do too many things rather than focus on what was critical."" His campaign has been conspicuously lacking in focus for weeks. If Romney can make the connection, his campaign hopes to convince those voters disappointed in Obama that Romney has a plan for the future. As Romney aides describe it, those target voters don't think that Obama is making things worse, but they are open to the pitch that Romney can make things better. They think Obama is just in low-performance mode, which isn't good enough. To play on that feeling, the Romney campaign broke its global land-speed record for ""gaffe"" identification on Thursday. In an attempt to show that President Obama was resigned to being stuck with the middling status quo, they highlighted something he said at the Univision town hall meeting. ""You can't change Washington from the inside,"" Obama said, when asked the biggest lesson he'd learned, ""you can only change it from the outside."" This is not a gaffe if the word is to have meaning at all. The idea that real change comes from the grass roots is what animated Obama's campaign in 2008. It's also what he's been saying for months and months about his own campaign when he tells voters he needs them to help him change Washington. It's the way an insider pretends that he is still the outsider. The idea that this suggests Obama has ""given up"" is further undermined by the fact that, in his next breath, the president says that it is this pressure from the outside that helped him pass health care reform and middle-class tax cuts. His point is about how you get around obstacles in Washington, not that he is resigned to them. What Obama is doing here is trying to pitch his own turnaround. Washington is stuck. So he's saying that in a second term, with even more help from the outside, he'll be able to build on the successes of the first term where outside pressure helped win the day. The president--like all of his predecessors--has an inflated view of his ability to bypass Congress by going directly to the people to get things done. It's a lot harder for presidents to do this than they think, and it's almost impossible if the country isn't already with you. And, despite what Obama says, he didn't have much success using the power of the grass roots to change minds on health care. He sure tried, attempting to activate his campaign team, Organizing for America, to build a groundswell. But he didn't change any Republican minds in Washington. Indeed, public appetite for a change in health care winnowed over the time that Obama advocated for it. Last summer, in a famous showdown with Eric Cantor over the debt limit deal, the president said ""don't call my bluff"" or I'll take it to the American people. Cantor called his bluff, so Obama took it to the American people and largely failed. No pressure was created to move Republicans off their position, and the president soon enjoyed some of the lowest approval ratings of his presidency. What the president said at the Univision town hall meeting was not only a harmless cliche about the importance of grass-roots power but a sentiment so weightless that it is a bipartisan bromide.  Politicians of both parties repeat this phrase when they are trying to come up with something more clever to say or simply giving their brains a rest. For example, as Ben Smith pointed out, in a 2007 debate GOP candidate Mitt Romney said, ""I don't think you change Washington from the inside. I think you change it from the outside."" Any self-respecting fan of the Tea Party would agree with the bedrock truth of this statement. It also echoes the challenge for the turnaround expert at this very moment. Facing pressure from the outside, Romney must show that he can make the change from within."	If Romney Is Such a Turnaround Expert, Can He Fix His Own Campaign?

Jews tend to veer Democratic, but only 69 percent of the Jews in Florida are prepared to vote for the incumbent. Seven out of 10 may sound like a lot, but it's less than the 78 percent that went for Gore in 2000 or the 76 percent that supported Kerry in 2004. Most crucially, it's also less than the 76 percent that turned out for Obama last election cycle. And the Sunshine State's Jews will soon hear a new voice asking them to reconsider four more years. Starting tomorrow, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will appear on Florida TV stations in an ad sponsored (we think) by Romney fans.

20	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/09/study_of_don_t_ask_don_t_tell_repeal_helped_the_military_.html	"During the debate over ""don't ask, don't tell""--which ended one year ago this week--Sen. John McCain insisted that ending the gay ban would do ""great damage"" to the military, and the commandant of the Marine Corps said it could ""cost Marines' lives."" One think-tanker agreed that we'd be taking ""a risk with our lives, property and freedom."" Another declared breathlessly that, ""ultimately all of civilian life will be affected."" Then there was the dire prediction that one-quarter of the military, or 500,000 troops, might quit in protest. Underlying the debate were competing moral visions, but the claims over harm to the military were where it often played out, on both sides. Gay rights proponents countered by pointing out that there was never any evidence that openly gay service would hurt the military, and that plenty of research from foreign countries suggested the opposite. Even studies conducted by the U.S. military itself, and by the Government Accountability Office, suggested readiness would not suffer if gays served openly. The trouble was that the research was predictive, not descriptive. No one could actually say for sure what the impact on the military of ending DADT would be. Until now. A new UCLA study, which I co-authored with other academics including military professors from all four U.S. military service academies, has assessed whether ending the gay ban has indeed harmed the armed forces. It hasn't. Our conclusion is that ending the policy ""has had no negative impact on overall military readiness or its component parts: unit cohesion, recruitment, retention, assaults, harassment or morale."" We surveyed 200 active-duty troops before and after repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell"" about cohesion in their units, and analyzed data from two other surveys. We also looked at recruitment and retention figures released by the Defense Department. We interviewed dozens of military scholars and officials, gay and straight troops, and policy experts, and we examined hundreds of media stories on the issue--reading every relevant piece we could find in a systematic search. We made a special effort to uncover any damage to cohesion, morale or readiness by reaching out to all known opponents of openly gay service. This included contacting anti-gay advocacy groups who would surely be listening for, and eager to publicize, any harm that occurred, and writing to over 500 retired generals who signed a 2009 letter predicting that repeal would ""undermine recruiting and retention, impact leadership at all levels, have adverse effects on the willingness of parents who lend their sons and daughters to military service, and eventually break the All-Volunteer Force.""(A ""standards of evidence"" discussion in the study explains how we weighed the different data types we found.) In one survey, more than 750 active duty troops were asked three months after repeal about their morale, housing, perception of officer and troop quality, and overall quality of life--factors considered key components of military readiness. All the figures were the same or slightly higher than in a parallel survey administered in the months before repeal, meaning readiness did not drop after repeal. Recruitment and retention figures throughout the military have remained steady, and survey responses indicate that troops are just as likely to re-enlist after repeal as before. The military confirmed the premature departure of two service members--not 500,000. Our in-depth interviews with 62 gay and straight service members corroborate the surveys data. A heterosexual Army Ranger, for instance, said that repealing ""don't ask, don't tell"" ""didn't affect cohesion... or how we interact, or force us to change any sort of accommodations for anyone."" Another straight solder said, ""It was a nonevent, like driving over a flat road. You don't even notice a ripple."" Not everyone was cheery about repeal. Yet, while some troops told us they remained personally opposed to openly gay service, the germane point is that overall morale and readiness did not suffer as a result of the policy change. A heterosexual Air Force captain said that even when military members felt personal opposition to homosexuality, this did not generally translate into poor behavior and unit-wide disruptions. ""That's just not how it works,"" he said. ""Individuals may have a problem, but there is no problem with the group opinion."" As West Point Chief of Staff Colonel Gus Stafford told us, much of the military community ""underestimated the adaptability and capability of our young people to adapt."" It was easy for us to conclude from our research that repealing ""don't ask, don't tell"" did no harm. But we found we could go beyond that: We can also report that after the military ended the gay ban, the institution itself improved, and not just for gay people but for the overall force. Lifting the ban, we found, improved the ability of the military to do its job by removing needless barriers to peer bonding, effective leadership and discipline. According to our interviews, peer relations improved as a greater degree of honesty and authenticity ""promoted increased understanding, respect and acceptance."" Leadership advanced because commanders can better understand and address the needs of their subordinates when troops are able to speak freely. One officer said the ban had hindered military leaders from helping ensure the personal readiness of their sailors: Commanders had been scared to ask basic personal questions lest they learn something they'd have to report. With the policy change, said the officer, ""everyone from leadership down were relieved."" Harassment against gay troops is easier to report and address now that gay victims don't fear that their own career could end if they speak up. We found repeated instances where coming out or being out elicited more respectful treatment, and allowed service members to successfully navigate what would otherwise have been an interpersonal minefield--rife with rumors, innuendo and threats. Removing ""don't ask, don't tell,"" in short, has enhanced bonding, trust, discipline and the rule of law inside the military, by eliminating conditions that had bred suspicion and mistreatment. Our research on gays in the military adds to an emerging body of evidence that's countering the long-held assumption that LGBT equality is harmful to society. This is a key lesson. After all, the public debate over same-sex marriage continues to hang on the question of whether it harms kids and families, another assertion that's never been proved. The latest such claim, a study by University of Texas professor Mark Regnerus, which he wrote about for Slate, not only sparked much criticism but earned a formal reprimand after Social Science Research, which published the study, asked an editorial board member to review it. Among other flaws, Regnerus relied on a sample size of two respondents raised by same-sex couples. Darren Sherkat, the sociologist who performed the review, summed up his assessment in an interview: ""It's bullshit."" We don't yet know if that's the best word to describe all empirical claims that LGBT equality hurts society--more data (and more equality) are still needed. But if you're looking for facts to back up your anti-gay values, they are becoming ever harder to find."	"New Study of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"": Repeal Helped the Military"

Some Republicans are already working on their talking points. A pattern has emerged in my conversations with GOP campaign veterans over the last 10 days. Here is how these conversations usually go. First, these Republicans defend Romney. Then, they point out that it's hard to beat an incumbent president, sigh that the press is in the tank for Obama, and point out that the polls are a lot closer than the chattering class makes it seem (Please see Gallup: Obama's bounce is gone). Romney might still pull it out, they say, if he can just connect with voters or tell a better story. But then the conversation inevitably turns to the ""big talk"" that's going to come after the election: What's the Republican Party going to look like in the future? If Romney loses, the party's leaders must change their ways to be in sync with the modern electorate. Caveat: If the opinions of political operatives and campaign partisans were always solid, Chris Christie would have run for president, Hillary Clinton would have traded jobs with Joe Biden, and the GOP would have had a brokered convention. So, this preliminary conversation about the fissures in the Republican Party might be just the idle chatter of people not intimately involved in the Romney game plan. But there comes a moment when these conversations break out into the open and then a campaign can't ignore them. The locker-room chatter runs the risk of becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. It's harder for a candidate to win an election when, months ahead of time, his party's smart people are having a public discussion about the post-election period in which he has already lost. In addition to my reporting, there are now some public signs. David Brooks offered a withering critique of Romney in a column today that ends with what feels like a post-election analysis seven weeks before the election. ""He's a kind, decent man who says stupid things because he is pretending to be something he is not--some sort of cartoonish government-hater. But it scarcely matters. He's running a depressingly inept presidential campaign."" In a piece for Politico today, the former GOP chairman Haley Barbour already sounds like he's offering post-game analysis. ""In the future, and not distant future, Republicans have to come to grips with the right policy on immigration,"" says Barbour. Bill Kristol also appears to be in the mood to offer final words on this campaign: ""Has there been a presidential race in modern times featuring two candidates who have done so little over their lifetimes for our country, and who have so little substance to say about the future of our country?"" (He is apparently not yet buying the Romney campaign's move to specificity). Why on earth would any self-respecting Republican rush to make definitive claims about Romney when a president with a weak record can still be turned out of office? Presumably the people making these claims care about the future of the conservative movement. There is a first-mover's advantage to getting your theory out fast so that your ideas can help shape the post-election debate. If you want your theory to become conventional wisdom, act now! But anyone who wants to stand up and make a bold claim has to engage in a balancing act: You want to be quick enough to have the stage to yourself, but not too quick so that it looks like you are being opportunistic. It's like criticizing a sitting president too early during a foreign-policy crisis: criticizing your own party should start at the election's edge. You might be saying, these columnists don't speak for me. You might call them Washington conservatives and point out, as several people not stricken with Potomac Fever have said to me, that this tentative heading for the exits is symptomatic of the timidity that has caused confusion in the party. That feeling is honest and part of the debate. It's likely to make you want to speak up to claim your view of where the conservative movement should go next before these insiders get too many free minutes at the microphone. That is how the debate gets started. Meanwhile, the race between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama is forgotten, which isn't good news for Gov. Romney. The rough contours of this conversation about the party's future center on whether the party's tone on immigration and the role of government have gotten out of sync with the electorate. Grassroots activists will argue that Romney was a compromise candidate who could never articulate the anti-government case for freedom and that's why he's having a hard time. (That is the argument Rick Santorum made during the primaries.) Others will argue that the Tea Party pushed Romney--as it will every candidate--into ever-more absolutist positions on immigration and the role of government. The majority of the country believes the government does too much. So there the Republicans should have the winning argument. But not when its candidate frames 47 percent of the electorate as moochers and victims. When the party of lower taxes is arguing that taxes should be increased on some people, it might be a moment to call a timeout and get everyone to agree on the playbook. Is this Mitt Romney's fault or did the party make him do it? Perhaps the discussion should move to the auditorium. Immigration is the topic that comes up most often in these conversations about a hypothetical post-election debate. That's because there is a direct relationship between the party's ideas and vision and the demographic changes Republicans will face in a country that is getting less white. Some people, like strategist Mike Murphy, have been arguing this point for a while. ""Republicans, including Romney, hurt themselves among Hispanic votes in the primary this year,"" Barbour told Politico, arguing that not only did the issue hurt Romney in states like Nevada and Florida, but it gave the president an issue he could exploit. A veteran of George W. Bush's campaigns argued to me recently that the Republican Party will have to go back to the campaign of 2000 to find the last time it spoke with an optimistic voice to Hispanics voters. There is already a meta-debate about the nature of the conservative debate itself. Brooks' article has now sparked a fight over whether a conservative is allowed to call himself a conservative when he is in disagreement with the Republican candidate for president. The Weekly Standard's Michael Warren compiles a list of conservatives who disagree with Romney's remarks about the supposed 47 percent who favor Obama, and Erick Erickson pushes back with his own list showing that conservatives agree with him (though many of the listed pieces simply say Romney's ""47 percent"" remark won't hurt him, which is different than agreeing with Romney).* The National Review's Michael Walsh backhands Brooks and the American Conservative's Rod Dreher weighs in defending Brooks. These are not specific debates about the future of the party, but the speed with which these voices came forward and then chose a camp is a sign of the unresolved tensions inside the GOP. And that is what gives energy to those conversations about the future of the party. Any successful campaign weathers the moment when the wise people pipe up to say the candidate is doing it wrong. That was the signature trait of the Obama 2008 campaign. But there is also a pattern to decline. Negative chatter from your own party builds and leads to finger-pointing, which leads to early verdicts, which leads to a debate about the future long before Election Day. The Romney campaign has already experienced the first two stages of this cycle. It's one more reason why he has to show that his campaign is alive and kicking. It's the only way to dispel the post-mortems. Correction, Sept. 19, 2012: This article originally misspelled Erick Erickson's last name. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"

Probably. It's also packed with smart mini-memos of strategy, straight from the candidate's brain. At one point, Romney tells a crowd of people who are donating at least $50,000 that they can't expect him to just go and tear out Barack Obama's jugular. ""We speak with voters across the country about their perceptions,"" says Romney in the video. ""The 5 to 6 or 7 percent that we have to bring onto our side--they all voted for Barack Obama four years ago. So ... when you say to them, 'Do you think Barack Obama is a failure?,' they overwhelmingly say no. They like him. But when you say, 'Are you disappointed that his policies haven't worked?,' they say yes."" Conveniently enough, this is the message that some of the biggest pro-Romney, anti-Obama super PACs are starting to deploy. For weeks, David Koch's Americans for Prosperity has run ads in which former Obama voters explain why they've given up on the guy. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal scooped that Ameritrade's Joe Ricketts would spend $10 million running commercials starring ""disaffected Obama supporters talking about why they plan to support Mr. Romney."" Back in May, Ricketts was presented with a plan to spend the same amount of money on a very different campaign. That one would have used a black spokesman to reignite the Jeremiah Wright issue. It was always a moronic idea for an ad. The conservative base fears Barack Obama the way a deer fears an oncoming 18-wheeler, but Republicans are already counting on the base to vote. They need those disappointed people. They need to tell them they're not alone. The Fellini of this campaign will be Steve Bannon, chairman of the late Andrew Breitbart's news group, director of the friendly Sarah Palin documentary The Undefeated. He's already done the work. His film The Hope and the Change, distributed by Citizens United, is a kaleidoscope biography of 40 people who voted for Obama and proceeded to work through the Kubler-Ross stages of grief. For 60 minutes, they appear on-screen--their first name, party affiliation, and state--and explain what happened. ""Everyone was just so excited for this savior of our nation,"" says a rueful Phyllis, from Florida. ""I watched his speeches for the first two and a half years,"" says Heaven, from North Carolina, ""and it got to the point where he really is repetitive."" ""Nobody comes to help bail me out,"" says Jack, from Iowa. ""There's a lot of people that are struggling. Where's their bailout?"" Every sane gripe about the Obama years makes it in there. Spoken by people like these--a smorgasbord of black, white, Asian, Hispanic, and Indian faces--they just sound logical, and sad. It took much of a year for Bannon to find them, aided by pollsters Pat Caddell and Kendra Stewart. They held focus groups with over 1,000 participants, in Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, North Carolina, and Ohio. The best subjects made it into the movie. ""There were people who'd say 'Gee, I don't know anything, what do you want me to say?' "" says Bannon. ""I'd tell them, 'This isn't TV. I'm just going to ask questions.' And that's why this is striking to people. There is real fear and anxiety on display here. These people still like Obama, so their criticism is said more in sorrow than in anger. Someone who's on the fence looks at them and thinks: 'I hear myself up there.' "" That's the goal of AFP's ads, too. Earlier this year, the group's bottomless funds were sunk into ""educational"" ads that informed voters of the Solyndra scandal. They ran in key states. If they moved the needle, that was temporary--at the Republican National Convention there was far more talk of President Obama's musings about small businesses and who does or doesn't ""build that."" The new ads ask, softly, if Obama's really ""earned your vote,"" by introducing voters to more first-names-only disappointed types. They were found at weekly AFP focus groups in swing states. They won't be the last. ""Most voters who like Obama like him personally,"" explains AFP spokesman Levi Russell. (He used to work with the much more base-focused Tea Party Express.) ""We're asking someone to break up with a person they probably like. We're asking them to separate emotional attachment from the record."" Bannon's movie came as a total surprise to AFP--""it's like an hour of the ads we have on TV right now!"" laughs Russell. But a little bit of accidental copy-catting is unavoidable. The sad-former-Obamaian is an archetype worth stealing. Even in 2016: Obama's America, the surprise hit documentary by Dinesh D'Souza, our narrator tells us that he wanted to believe in Mr. Hope and Change. ""Just like the rest of the country, I was intrigued by Obama,"" says D'Souza. ""We both have a kind of mixed-race background."" And he liked Obama's 2004 speech to the Democratic National Convention. His subsequent investigation of the president's Kenyan anti-colonial thinking was motivated by--ah, this phrase again--sorrow, not anger. Romney knows that, and when a room of wealthy Floridians tell him to nail Obama, it's up to him to break the news. ""They voted for him,"" says Romney of the disappointed voters. ""They don't want to be told that they were wrong, that he's a bad guy, that he did bad things, that he's corrupt. Those people that we have to get, they want to believe they did the right thing, but he just wasn't up to the task. They love the phrase that he's 'over his head.' "" They love it. Once this story runs itself out, they'll be hearing it again."	Has Romney Introduced You to Those Sad Obama Voters?

A lot, apparently; he's so much of a ""fitness guy,"" as he's said, that for days after Mitt Romney chose him as his vice-presidential candidate, the media could talk about little else but the fact that Ryan leads a group of congressmen in a daily workout called P90X, a hugely popular, high-intensity workout routine with a cultlike following. The legend of Paul Ryan's physical fitness got even crazier when the boy-wonder V.P. candidate bragged to Hugh Hewitt about his marathon running, claiming he'd run the 26.2-mile race in ""under three [hours], high twos. I had a two hour and fifty-something. ... I was fast when I was younger, yeah."" Of course, we now know that was a lie. As Runner's World discovered, Ryan's time was 4:01:25, and as a Ryan spokesman admitted, it was his one and only marathon. He was 20 when he ran it, and yet he still would have lost to a 40-ish Sarah Palin. Whoops. Diehard runners were ticked off, of course, and the Ryan marathon soon became a punch line. Left unexamined, however, was another, equally outrageous claim: That Ryan has 6 percent body fat. This was endlessly repeated at the time of his selection--trumpeted in headlines (both here and abroad) and even in editorial-page cartoons. ""Oh, to be a pair of calipers,"" swooned Jon Stewart on The Daily Show. ""Paul Ryan shirtless"" became one of the most popular Internet searches--despite yielding only one softish vacation photo--which makes it all the more strange that nobody has taken a closer look. Well, guess what: He's probably lying about the body fat thing, too. Or, at best, wildly exaggerating. The ""6 percent body fat"" meme seems to have originated in a 2010 interview with Mike Allen of Politico. Allen asked him about P90X--""a fad, a craze that you've created here on Capitol Hill."" Ryan, who says he once worked as a ""fitness trainer,"" talks about the workout group, which at the time he led with then-Rep. Bart Stupak (D-Mich.): ""Tony Horton, the creator of it, comes by and works out with us every few months. It works because it's called muscle confusion, it hits your body in many different ways--pull-ups, push-ups, sit-ups, lots of cardio, karate, jump training, yoga. So what it does is it pushes your body in many different ways so that it gets out of its plateau."" Sounds good. But then he can't help but brag: ""I keep my body fat between 6 and 8 percent,"" he tells Allen. Here's who else maintains 6 to 8 percent body fat: Olympic 100-meter sprinters, that's who. Also, world-class boxers, wrestlers, and marathoners, according to this study of elite American athletes. Top collegiate swimmers look pretty fit, right? Well, they average out at a plump 9.5 percent, at least according to another study. Positively porky, compared to Ryan. (For some perspective, the average man has body fat of 17 to 24 percent, and most women a bit more.) If his claim is to be believed--a Ryan spokesman did not respond to questions--he's more along the lines of Tour de France cyclists who also get down around 8 or 9 percent to prepare for major races. According to Inigo San Millan, a veteran cycling physiologist who has worked with numerous Tour de France teams, the lowest body fat he's ever measured on a cyclist was 8.3 percent. That's at peak fitness, racing shape. Ryan's claim, in other words, puts him squarely in the company of elite athletes. (And also, freakily, with these guys.) But while Ryan is definitely skinny--he told Allen that he's 6-foot-2 and weighs 163 pounds, and his suits flutter like a Christo project gone wrong--that might be a stretch. At anything less than 10 percent body fat, says Martin Rooney, a well-known trainer who works with NFL and MMA athletes, ""a man with his shirt off is lean and shredded. Veins everywhere and really cut up. This is the model and bodybuilder look. So if he is saying he is 6 percent, he is shredded with a six-pack and should have no reason not to do photo shoots everywhere."" So far, he hasn't. The only topless Ryan photo to surface is this grainy vacation shot on TMZ, from before he started P90X. So we can't know for sure. Also not showing up: any summit shots from Ryan's claimed 38 trips up Colorado's 14,000-foot-high peaks, or ""fourteeners,"" a claim that has also generated skepticism among climbers. In a nutshell, there was confusion over whether Ryan had climbed 40 of the state's 53 fourteeners, as he seems to have led at least one local politician to believe, or (as a campaign statement later clarified) ""almost 40 climbs"" up 28 different peaks. Ryan wouldn't be the first guy to dissemble about his physical attributes. But with him it's become a pattern: first the marathon, then the dubious mountain climbs, as well as some minor confusion about the exact level of his skiing prowess. (He told Ryan Lizza of The New Yorker that he was on Janesville Craig High School's ""ski team,"" when in fact the school only maintains a ski club.) ""Sounds a lot like when guys say they can also bench 300 pounds, run a 4.5 forty, etc.,"" says Rooney. Still, it's not impossible that he's telling the truth. P90X is certainly intense. Ryan is definitely fit. And one of his workout buddies, 29-year-old Illinois Rep. Aaron Schock, really did make the cover of Men's Health last year. ""They're both very fit, very lean, and on top of their game,"" says P90X founder Tony Horton, who estimates that he's worked out with the congressional gym rats six or eight times. ""I know that he kind of spaced out on his marathon time, but I've stood next to that guy. And he's easily 6 to 8 percent body fat. You just have to eat right and exercise every day, and that's what he does."" He must do it very well, because that would make him even leaner than Horton himself, who porks out at a robust 9 percent body fat, according to a recent Men's Health profile. That figure was just an estimate, Horton told me: ""I haven't measured my body fat in 10 years."" Body fat is fairly tricky to measure. The standard tape-measure-and-caliper methods, which measure the thickness of skinfolds at various body sites, can vary by as much as 6 percentage points, says Gary Hunter, a professor of physiology at the University of Alabama in Birmingham. Underwater weighing (which is exactly what it sounds like) and DXA scans (dual X-ray images that discern fat from other tissue) are more accurate, and also more expensive and complicated. But even if Ryan did get his body fat measured regularly, as he implied to Politico, it seems oddly vain to do so. ""If he was measured at all, my first question would be, why?"" asks Men's Health workout columnist Lou Schuler. ""Why would a lean and obviously objectively fit congressman need to know his body-fat percentage? I don't know mine, and I write about this stuff for a living."" Finally, even assuming Ryan is telling the truth, and his body fat really is that low, it raises questions about his judgment. ""It's hard to sustain,"" says Hunter. ""Physiologically, you aren't going to be functioning real well. Your strength levels will probably go down, you will feel fatigued, and your hormone levels will be disturbed."" At very low body-fat levels, strange things start happening. Starved for energy, the body starts consuming muscle instead of fat, in what's known as a catabolic state. Low fat levels also affect immune function. In the 1940s, the legendary nutritionist Ancel Keys (father of the military's K-rations) subjected a group of 36 men to a severely restricted diet, amounting to about half what they were used to eating. The results of the Minnesota Starvation Experiment were shocking, both scientifically and visually. The subjects' ribs protruded, and their stomachs caved in; they looked like prisoners. Keys took precise body-fat measurements of his subjects, and found that they bottomed out around 5 percent--1 percent below Ryan's claim. Whether from lack of body fat, or plain lack of food, they basically went crazy. One study participant lost three fingers to an axe--but was not sure whether it had been an accident or intentional. So until those shirtless pics emerge showing a veined, ""cut,"" muscle-mag-worthy bod under those Brooks Brothers suits, let's just hope that this one is just another Paul Ryan brag."	Why Does Paul Ryan Keep Hyping His Physical Prowess?
27	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/09/u_s_embassy_attack_mitt_romney_was_quick_to_let_his_views_be_known_in_response_to_the_foreign_policy_crisis_in_libya_and_egypt_.html	"Usually when the presidential campaign conversation revolves around tone, timing, and how a certain story is ""playing,"" we've reached a discouraging place. The policy is more important than the politics, so let's not get caught up in the theatrics. In the case of the violence in Egypt and Libya, the underlying policy is still more important, but the theatrics are not entirely trivial. In international affairs, what, when, and how you say something is important. That fact is at the heart of both Romney's complaint about the U.S. embassy's response to violence in Egypt and the critique of Romney's response. Here's what happened: shortly before protests erupted in Egypt, the U.S. embassy in Cairo issued a statement ""condemn(ing) the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims.""* The statement was issued in response to an anti-Muslim movie allegedly inflaming the rioters. The mission was then attacked. The embassy condemned the violence and reiterated its earlier statement. Romney issued a press release saying he was ""outraged by the attacks"" and the death of an American consulate worker in Benghazi, Libya where violence had also erupted and where later, three more would be reported dead, including the ambassador. Romney went on to say that it was ""disgraceful that the Obama Administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks."" What is a voter to make of Gov. Romney's response to these dramatic events, which also included a press conference where he stood by his initial reaction? If diplomacy is a balance between seizing the moment and knowing when doing so will hurt your larger cause, has Romney shown himself to be a successful leader? Romney believes that U.S. policy has been too concerned with the feelings of our enemies and rivals around the world. Here you had an embassy trying to forestall riots by showing empathy. Romney thinks that is weak and dangerous, which is why the embassy's statement did nothing. This mindset is so dangerous he had to speak right away and not exercise the political challenger's usual restraint embodied in Sen. Arthur Vandenberg's phrase that ""politics are supposed to stop at the water's edge."" The thinking in the Romney camp is that there is no better time than the present to point out what you think is a catastrophic flaw. In short, Romney wanted to dispense with custom to get his point across. It's ridiculous to maintain niceties when there are vital issues at stake. Sometimes not maintaining the old customs shows just how serious you are. When Romney insulted the British by saying they weren't so well prepared for the Olympics, he defended himself by saying he was merely giving straight talk to an ally. The conditions were significant enough that politesse wasn't warranted. Before the Libya story broke, President Obama was being criticized for not meeting with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In that case, Romney thought the president--who can talk to Netanyahu whenever he wants--was not maintaining the niceties of a personal tete-a-tete required when such a crucial U.S. ally would be in the country. In this instance, the Republican candidate obviously wasn't out of line in thinking the initial embassy statement was too soft. The State Department thought so too and issued a statement saying that the embassy statement hadn't been vetted and that violence is never warranted. But since the State Department was already on the case, did Romney really need to speak out? The original wrong had been corrected, all that was to be gained by rushing out to a microphone was political advantage. Of course, there's nothing wrong with Romney trying to take political advantage. This is a campaign, after all. In fact, good for Gov. Romney. This campaign could use a vigorous fight over foreign policy. So far, the campaign has been almost totally devoid of a discussion of foreign policy, an issue area where a president has arguably more power than the economy. Proof of this lack of emphasis is that Romney picked a vice president with almost no foreign-policy experience. The Romney camp probably rightly calculated that Paul Ryan's inexperience on this front wouldn't be that big a liability. Foreign policy hasn't been a front-burner in this campaign, so Romney knew people wouldn't giggle when he claimed Ryan was uniquely qualified to step in as president. But was this the exact moment to dispel the campaign's lack of foreign-policy focus? That takes us back to Romney's audition for the role of diplomat. Do people have a better understanding of his views about Obama's foreign-policy weaknesses because he moved swiftly? Or did he bury his policy argument by breaking with custom and failing to understand the context for his remarks? He surely knew that anything he said would be interpreted in a political context. Was he right that his point was so winning that it could survive the inevitable criticism it would bring? Was it so winning that it was worth putting it out there quickly when events might change and make him look uninformed? Was it worth setting a new rapid response standard for speaking out forcefully on developments in the world? The answers to these questions will tell us not just if Romney can weather this moment politically, but whether he will be able to get the balance right when he's faced with just these kinds of challenges as president. Correction, Sept. 13, 2012: This article originally stated that the embassy in Cairo issued its initial statement ""as protests erupted in Egypt."" The embassy tweeted the statement before protests began outside its walls. (Return to the corrected sentence.)"	Will Foreign-Policy Issues Reveal the Real Mitt Romney?
28	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/09/mitt_romney_losing_election_conservatives_are_worried_he_ll_lose_because_he_is_being_too_vague_about_his_ideas_and_agenda_.html	"Mitt Romney is enjoying at least the fourth public loss of confidence by conservative elites since winning the nomination. The first came in June when Rupert Murdoch and others complained that he was not taking the fight to Barack Obama. Then in July, he was faulted for thinking he could skate to victory by running only as the anti-Obama. Then in early August, GOP veteran voices again counseled against the passive campaign and urged Romney to be bold by picking a vice president with some substance. Now the fever arrives again from a variety of conservative quarters that he is not giving voters a reason to vote for him. If you were a medicine man, you might notice that the fever comes on hardest at the start of every month. Perhaps it is triggered by soft monthly jobs reports. The view may be that given the persistently glum economic news, even an area rug could beat the incumbent. Romney should be doing better, so: panic. As George Will put it recently: ""If the Republican Party cannot win in this environment, it has to get out of politics and find another business."" Whatever the reason behind the outbreaks, campaign wizards at Romney's Boston headquarters should start mixing the October poultice now. At the heart of the critique are two points: Romney is not taking the fight to Obama and he's being too vague about what he would do as president. The first seems wrong. Romney's welfare ads are tough. The ""you didn't build that"" criticism has been persistent and hard. Paul Ryan has traded away his reputation as a policy wonk and become an attack dog. That's an expensive trade. Romney is not slow on the attack. When the Democratic platform omitted any mention of God, Romney accused Obama of taking Him off the dollar bill. Perhaps what people like Donald Trump want is for Romney to make personal attacks the way the Obama team does. That's possibly dangerous. More voters have an unfavorable view of Romney than favorable, so Romney is probably wise to not go as far as the Donald would like. (Life rule: It's generally a good idea to stop short of what Donald Trump thinks you should do.) There is more merit to the knock on Romney's vagueness. If Romney doesn't get more specific, they may not find him appealing enough to leave Obama. That would be bad for Romney and Republicans, of course, but there may also be a way in which Romney's lack of specificity is bad for everyone. If Romney doesn't get more specific, whichever party wins will have no mandate for governing. If Romney wins, his lack of specificity will mean he has no mandate. If Obama wins, Republicans will conclude that the president didn't prevail in a contest of ideas; he simply defeated a bad politician, which will make them no more likely to cooperate with him. When Mitt Romney picked Paul Ryan he put the doubters into remission. For a moment, they thought he was going to get specific and run on the ideas that Ryan championed. Romney and his aides sold the decision this way, too. But this was not to be. As George W. Bush's speechwriter Michael Gerson writes, ""Romney's message is untouched by his running mate's revolutionary fiscal realism. Romney chose Ryan, not Ryanism."" Romney's advisers and the candidate himself have long believed that actual specifics are deadly. All they do is give your opponent an opportunity to attack you. Why do that when you're still out-polling by double digits among independent voters and down by just a point or two in the polls overall? That is a reasonable view. Obama has a similar view about specifics. He's been forced to be more specific as president than as a candidate, of course, but ask him for his long-term plan for Medicare and you are likely to never get that invitation to play basketball that you've been waiting for. The ""you're so vague"" complaint may be an attempt to put a label on a longstanding and harder to categorize challenge that has clung to the Romney candidacy: He can't close the deal. In the primaries, he had a hard time knocking much weaker rivals like Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich out of the race. Now he's having a harder time of it against Obama, a weak president whose campaign is not terribly inspiring. Still, Romney might win. But if he does, what will he have won? A mandate for his policies? Almost certainly not. Polls show that people don't trust that Romney is on their side or that his policies will improve their lives. They're not likely to give him much leeway to enact his plan to alter their lives through sweeping spending cuts, overhaul of the country's health care system, and reconfiguration of entitlements like Medicare and Social Security. ""Winning the next election without having really prepared the country and rallied the country to do some big things would be a huge lost opportunity,"" said Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels months ago. After Wisconsin Democrats failed to oust GOP Gov. Scott Walker in a recall vote, Walker publicly advised Romney to become more specific about what he would do as president. So far Romney and Ryan have only been specific in naming Obama's flaws. When Ryan says he welcomes the fight over Medicare, he really only means that he welcomes the opportunity to criticize his opponent. Political scientists are skeptical about the power of an election mandate to convince the country to go in a direction it isn't inclined to go. Just because you won an election doesn't mean people are sold on all of your ideas. But Republicans don't see it that way. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said at the convention that a leader changes the polls, he doesn't let the polls change him. If that's that case, a candidate has to convince people about the plans he intends to enact. Voters can't just intuit these things. If Obama wins, Romney's lack of specifics will rob Obama of the leverage he might gain from truly vanquishing the GOP's ideas. Republicans will conclude that Romney lost because he was a bad candidate and didn't sell conservative principles. There will be no reason to back down in future fights with the president because the ideas undergirding their beliefs won't have been discredited by a Romney loss--only Romney will have been discredited. Tea Party activists will draw this conclusion as well. The ideas didn't lose; the candidate did, in part because he didn't stand up loud and proud for conservative ideas. Any Republican politicians who compromise with the president or backs down on conservative principles will have a target on their back in the next election cycle. Anyone who shrinks from a fight will be considered no better than Mitt Romney."	Why Conservatives Panic Over Mitt Romney Every Four Weeks
29	http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/09/how_the_democratic_party_s_platform_controversy_over_israel_and_god_was_caused_by_a_small_group_of_conservative_journalists_.html	"Read the rest of Slate's coverage of the Democratic National Convention. CHARLOTTE, N.C.--Joe Biden's eyes welled up, bigger-than life on the Time Warner Cable Arena screens. ""We acknowledge the incredible debt we owe to the families""--fighting back tears now--""of the 6,473 fallen angels."" The Georgia delegate standing next to me sniffed, and took a deep breath to ward off the waterworks. The Democratic strategist on the other side looked vindicated, because up to then, we'd been talking about how the party had been forced to amend its platform language, stuff that voters never seem to care about, because of a media firestorm over its references to Israel. ""This time yesterday,"" said the strategist, ""I was sitting in my office and asking: Are we really talking about this? Are people really covering this? It's over, I guess, but how stupid was that?"" Whatever lessons the Democrats take from Charlotte, whatever it did for the president or for the ambitious senators and governors who stalked delegate breakfasts and whispered ""2016,"" this is a fact: The convention was successfully trolled. I don't use troll in the pejorative sense. Actually, I may be trying to craft a neutral meaning of troll where none previously existed. The term, in its modern Internet usage, refers to people who want to start fights online to bring the universe into an argument on their terms. It comes not from Grimm literature, but from a fishing technique in which multiple lines are baited and dragged to haul in the maximum amount of cold-bloods. Democrats did not expect to spend Wednesday arguing about the capital of Israel and the appearance of the word ""God"" in their platform. There were, reportedly, 15,000 members of the media in Charlotte, of whom maybe 14,980 could have given a damn about the party platform. On Tuesday night, when the Obama campaign and the DNC released its platform, none of the bigfoot media outlets in town spent time on the text. No, it took until Wednesday morning for Jeff Dunetz, at the YidWithALid blog, to comment that ""Democrats have removed this pro-Israel section from their platform."" (They had removed references to Hamas and references to Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.) At 11:26 a.m., Weekly Standard reporter Daniel Halper published a story on the platform, making the same point. (He credited YidWithALid.) It could have ended there. But within a few hours, CNN and Fox News were browbeating Democrats to ask why they'd changed the platform--why, too, had they removed an old reference to ""God-given talents,"" and thus deleted YHWH from the text? Democrats gave up. They forced a vote on new platform language, restoring the 2008 lines. Convention chairman Antonio Villaraigosa affirmed the change even though nobody--seriously, nobody--thought that the sleepy midday convention hall had given it a two-thirds ""aye"" vote. Maybe the word ""historic"" is out of place for the modern convention. To say that they're cliched and staged is, in itself, a staged cliche. But who thought, just 11 months after the launch of the Occupy movement, that 99 percenters would have less influence on the platform than conservative media? This is what I mean: We live in the age of trolling. Any comment made online, if it's given the right forum, is as relevant as any comment made by some media gatekeeper. Think about a politician or a journalist on Twitter, and what he sees. If a colleague wants to tell him something, it appears in his feed with an @ symbol. If someone who just logged on and wants to bait a nerd logs on, he will send a message that appears with an @ symbol. Both are equally valid, at least in how they appear on-screen or on a phone. There is no ghetto-izing of comments into the bottom of a page, or into media that you don't pay attention to. And a small band of happy saboteurs took advantage of that. In Tampa, for the Republican convention, the Weekly Standard and the Washington Examiner, both owned by Philip Anschutz's Clarity Media, had teamed up for a daily mini-magazine of happy-friendly-witty convention stories. A typical headline was ""The Pride of New Jersey: Chris Christie, by Those Who Know Him Best."" In Charlotte, a team of four Washington Times reports dropped cluster bombs on the DNC opera, with stories like the platform series and ""Another Dem. Compares Republicans to Nazis."" The Dem in question, Alexandra Gallardo Rooker, is vice-chair of the California Democratic Party, one of four people to make a Third Reich metaphor this week and immediately appear on the Drudge Report. ""Regarding 'trolling,' "" Weekly Standard reporter John McCormack told me via email, ""I think the word 'reporting' would be better.""* I agree. The Washington Times, the Examiner, and other conservative media were trying to get Democrats on the record on subjects they'd rather ignore and finesse. ""The mainstream press had a good amount of coverage on GOP platform's abortion plank,"" wrote McCormack, ""(which was silent on exceptions and hadn't changed at all from past) so they could talk about abortion in the instance of rape."" The rest of the media skipped out on covering the Democrats' platform negotiations, and missed out on the story of the Jerusalem planks. But why did conservatives get it? The Washington Free Beacon, a 7-month-old new site run by Washington Times alums, filed its own nagging stories about the convention (""DNC Delegates for Truth: Conventioneer Also a Member of 9/11-Focused PAC""), and dogged Democrats about an unforced error made by DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, when she claimed a Washington Examiner reporter lied about a quote he had on tape. The Washington Free Beacon stated, in its first editorial, that it would answer and outplay the ""wolf pack"" of liberal journalists who tried to protect the party. It was formed as part of the ""Center for American Freedom,"" which had been obviously designed as a parody of the Center for American Progress. In other words, trolling. ""We put a lot of resources into covering the convention,"" says Center for American Freedom's Michael Goldfarb, ""and we think it paid off in our coverage of the platform fiasco that more established papers like the Post all but ignored. There was a real demand for hard-hitting, fact-based coverage of this Godless, anti-Israel convention, and we're doing our best to give people what they want."" The Examiner, Washington Times, and Center for American Freedom's teams were only fractions of the size of the CNN or New York Times teams in Charlotte. But they wrote the convention's distracting stories. On Wednesday night, CNN scored an interview with Wasserman Schultz on the convention floor. She'd trekked to Tampa for the Republican convention, attempting to step on their message. But in Charlotte, her unique ability to create arguments that are both perfectly formed and supernaturally unconvincing was obliterated by the trolling. ""President Obama really felt,"" she said, ""that it was personally important to him that his personal view--that Jerusalem is and will always be the capital of Israel--was reflected in the platform."" The network cut back to Anderson Cooper. ""I mean, Debbie Wasserman Schultz just said: It wasn't a change of language,"" said Cooper, mocking the DNC chairman on air. ""There was no discord that we saw. It was a two-thirds vote. I mean, that's an alternate universe."" The platform fight faded from the late-week headlines. The masters of trolling, emboldened, kept on puncturing what they saw, previewing how they'd make the general election a pain for President Obama. It continued while I was watching that Joe Biden speech, which was well received by the big TV media. About that ""fallen angels"" line, though. The Weekly Standard had to weigh in on that. ""While of course the sentiment is laudatory,"" wrote Halper, ""the language is not. A 'fallen angel' is an angel who has gone bad.""
